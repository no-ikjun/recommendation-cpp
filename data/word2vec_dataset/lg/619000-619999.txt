 Pokémon Colosseum is a 3D role @-@ playing game viewed from a third @-@ person perspective . The player , controlling a Pokémon Trainer named Wes ( default name ) , moves through various towns and other locations ( traversed using a type of one @-@ wheeled motorcycle ) , battling enemy Trainers and completing quests . Items are purchased at " Pokémon Mart " locations using the game 's currency , " Pokémon Dollars " ( ) . When a battle starts , the screen switches to a turn @-@ based interface where the player 's and enemies ' Pokémon fight . Most battles are of the " double battle " format , which means two Pokémon on each side at one time . However , each Trainer can carry up to six Pokémon at one time , so once a Pokémon is defeated , his or her Trainer must switch out another one unless no more are left . Battles are also conducted at " Colosseums " in several cities . 
 Unlike most Pokémon games , Colosseum does not feature random encounters . The player begins the game with two Pokémon . More are obtained throughout the game by " <unk> " them from other Trainers using Poké Balls of various strengths . Only specifically designated " Shadow Pokémon " , whose hearts have been artificially closed , can be <unk> . Pokémon can be traded between Colosseum and the Game Boy Advance games Pokémon Ruby , Sapphire , FireRed , LeafGreen , or Emerald . 
 Each of the player 's Shadow Pokémon has a purple gauge that is drained by battling and coming to like the player . Once a Pokémon 's gauge is empty , the player may " <unk> " the Pokémon by bringing him or her to Celebi 's shrine in Agate Village , or by using a rare " Time Flute " item . Purifying Shadow Pokémon is desirable because while in that status , they will often disobey the player , they cannot gain experience points , and their moves are at first restricted to " Shadow Rush " . Additionally , Shadow Pokémon will sporadically enter " Hyper Mode " state during battle , causing them to disobey the player character or attack themselves until the condition is alleviated by selecting the " Call " battle command . 
 Aside from the story mode , Colosseum also features several non @-@ canonical battle modes . In the " Quick Battle " mode , the player can battle either CPU trainers or friends , using Pokémon obtained in the story mode or randomly assigned ones . Battles in this mode do not result in gain of experience points or money . In the single @-@ player battle mode , the player competes at Colosseums — stadiums used throughout the game for Pokémon battles — and earns " Poké Coupons " , another currency which can be used to buy rare items . In the " Gang Battle " mode , up to four players can compete in a tournament . The first can use Pokémon obtained in the story mode , or from the Game Boy Advance games . Players two through four , however , can only use Pokémon from the Game Boy Advance games .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Pokémon Colosseum is set in the Orre region . Orre is a mostly <unk> region in which no wild Pokémon can be found ( although the sequel , Pokémon XD : Gale of Darkness , adds wild Pokémon spots to the region ) . Orre consists of many cities , towns , and Colosseums . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The game 's player protagonist is by default named Wes ( <unk> , Reo , Leo ) , but as with most Pokémon games , the player can change his name . Wes 's Starter Pokémon are <unk> and <unk> , two fox @-@ like Pokémon who start at higher levels than most Starter Pokémon . Team Snagem ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ dan , Team Snatch ) , a criminal organization that uses the " Snag machine " technology to capture the Pokémon of Trainers , serves as an antagonistic entity in the game . However , shortly after the game 's start , the Cipher Syndicate ( <unk> , <unk> , Shadow ) is revealed to be the main antagonistic force , having partnered with Snagem to obtain Pokémon from Trainers , corrupting them , and distributing them throughout Cipher and other places such as Pyrite Town . Wes is a former employee of Team Snagem . The organization also employs many grunt workers , as well as four administrators : disco @-@ loving Miror B. ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) , the explosively @-@ tempered bodybuilder , Dakim ( <unk> , <unk> ) , the queen of the Under , Venus ( <unk> , <unk> ) , and the strategist of a scientist , Ein ( <unk> , <unk> , Borg ) . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The game begins with a cold open in which Wes infiltrates and destroys the Team Snagem hideout before leaving the organization . Wes starts at the <unk> Stand , a dilapidated train engine in the middle of the desert that has been converted into a shop . With <unk> and <unk> , Wes 's first opponent is a Trainer named Willie . Wes then leaves the Stand and heads to the oasis @-@ esque Phenac City in time to see two men dragging a sack . After defeating them in battle , Wes unties the sack to find Rui , a girl with the ability to discern Shadow Pokémon . They meet the mayor , Es Cade , who seems very bothered about the Cipher problem , but seems to do nothing about it . Later , upon leaving Phenac Colosseum , three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui . The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem , and an excellent <unk> . Wes then confronts one of the grunts , which results in the latter 's defeat . Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon , Rui asks him to join forces with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon . 
 As the game progresses , Wes becomes a target of a powerful organization known as Cipher . After leaving Phenac , he visits Pyrite Town , where Rui was kidnapped . In Pyrite , Shadow Pokémon are openly offered to winners of the town 's Colosseum tournament . The local police force is powerless to stop the practice , so Duking , an influential man in Pyrite , asks Wes to enter the tournament and investigate . Wes enters the Colosseum challenge and defeats four trainers to win . Inside a nearby building , a Cipher <unk> is about to present the Shadow Pokémon prize , but another one recognizes Wes . The pair then battle their way through the building and a maze @-@ like cave set in the rock behind . Eventually , they face and defeat Miror B. , one of four Cipher <unk> . Afterwards , Wes returns a Pokémon Miror B. stole from Duking . A team of kids working in Duking 's house introduce themselves as members of an anti @-@ Cipher news network , known as the Kids Grid , who pledge their help to Wes and Rui . 
 Their next stop is Agate Village , a forested village in the mountains . As Rui introduces Wes to her grandfather Eagun , another villager runs into the room , telling them that the Relic Stone — a shrine protected by Celebi — is under attack . Wes , following Eagun to the center of the tree , fights off four Cipher agents before the Relic Stone is safe . After resting , Wes is given access to the Relic Stone , the only place where he can purify Shadow Pokémon . On a suggestion from Eagun , Wes decides to train his skills at the nearby Mt . Battle . 
 Upon reaching Mt . Battle , people inform Wes and Rui that Cipher has already taken over the first section of the mountain . After battling nine other Trainers , Wes battles the Cipher administrator Dakim . Dakim owns a Shadow Entei , who is one of the trio of legendary beasts . After defeating Dakim , Wes heads to The Under , which is an underground city located underneath Pyrite Town , and under the control of Cipher . More members of the Kids Grid are here . They tell the player of Venus , another Cipher administrator , who has influence over The Under . After Wes confronts Venus , the owner of the second legendary beast Suicune , she flees . Next , Wes and Rui head to the Shadow Pokémon Lab , where Pokémon are transformed into Shadow Pokémon . After defeating numerous Cipher peons , Wes faces Ein , the final Cipher administrator and the owner of the final legendary beast Raikou . 
 Wes and Rui then go to <unk> Tower . All four administrators are there and ready to face Wes again . After doing so , he is granted access to the Colosseum at the top of the building . There , he is greeted by a large crowd . A Cipher man named Nascour tells Wes that he will have to face four trainers . After Wes defeats all four trainers , Nascour fights him . Once defeated , Nascour tries to leave , only to be interrupted by Es Cade . Es Cade reveals that he is really none other than Evice , the head of Cipher , and battles Wes . When Wes defeats him , Evice attempts to escape by helicopter , but the legendary Pokémon Ho @-@ Oh swoops in and blasts it out of the sky . Evice and Nascour are presumably arrested . 
 = = Development and release = = 
 Pokémon Colosseum was developed by the Japanese game developer Genius Sonority , and published by Nintendo . Just as Nintendo 64 predecessors Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Stadium 2 had served as home console counterparts to the first- and second @-@ generation handheld titles , Colosseum had a similar role for the third generation . 
 The new concept for Pokémon Colosseum was influenced by RPGs such as Final Fantasy VII and Persona 2 over the Pokémon mold . When asked in an interview with Prima Games why the gameplay of Colosseum did not mirror that of the handheld Pokémon games , Pokémon director Junichi Masuda explained : " How players communicate with each other has been key to the Pokémon games – it is the backbone of all Pokémon game designs . I feel that the handheld systems work better than the home @-@ based consoles . It 's certainly possible to come up with concepts for home @-@ based consoles , but we might then have to change the core of the game . " 
 The transition to 3D also brought new graphical changes . Wes was designed to look " hazy " and about 17 years old . Genius Sonority ported most of the models and animations of first- and second @-@ generation Pokémon from Stadium and Stadium 2 . Genius Sonority based most of Orre on the real @-@ life city of Phoenix , Arizona . As a whole , the graphics were influenced more by manga than by established Pokémon convention . 
 A preview for the game was hosted at E3 2003 . Upon completion of development , Colosseum received a rating of " E " ( Everyone ) from the Entertainment Software Rating Board , " All Ages " from Computer Entertainment Rating Organization , and " 3 + " from Pan European Game Information . The game was released on November 21 , 2003 in Japan ; March 22 , 2004 in North America , and May 14 , 2004 in Europe . 
 Nintendo also published supplementary media to unlock additional content . Pre @-@ ordered copies of the game came with a bonus disc that contains trailers for the game and the film Pokémon : Jirachi Wish Maker . The North American disc also contains the exclusive Pokémon Jirachi that can be downloaded to the player 's copy of Ruby or Sapphire . The Japanese release contains a downloadable Celebi instead and requires a completed save file of Pokémon Colosseum . The disc also updates the software in Ruby and Sapphire to remove a " berry glitch " discovered in 2003 . Despite public anticipation the Bonus Disc was not released in PAL territories , prompting Nintendo to issue an official apology . However a Jirachi was later included in the PAL version of the game Pokémon Channel . In Japan , <unk> cards for the Nintendo e @-@ Reader were available for purchase that featured additional trainers to battle and Shadow Pokémon .

 Pokémon Colosseum was generally well @-@ received upon release , with respective scores of 73 / 100 and 73 @.@ 46 % from aggregators Metacritic and Game Rankings . Allgame staff writer Scott Alan Marriott gave the game three and a half stars out of five , although he did not review the game with more depth . 
 Critics praised Colosseum as the first true 3D role @-@ playing installment in the Pokémon series . Gamers Hell reviewer John K. called it " certainly a step in the right direction to a good 3D Pokémon game " , although he felt that the limited number of Pokémon and lack of a true overworld detracted from the experience . IGN staff writer Craig Harris said that the adaptation of the Pokémon RPG formula to the 3D zeitgeist " does a decent enough job " and is " a bit more linear and straightforward " . 
 The new 3D graphics received mixed remarks . Harris called the game " [ g ] <unk> ... a mixed bag " , praising the visual style of the game 's Pokémon but criticizing the " poorly modeled and animated , angular " style of the Trainers . GameSpot reviewer Ryan Davis offered a similar opinion , concluding that " [ t ] he visual style ... has gone off the deep end " . GamePro writer Star Dingo called the graphics as a whole " insanely cute " but criticized the lack of animations showing two Pokémon attacking in tandem . GameZone 's review took a more positive stance , saying that " [ a ] <unk> are brief but impressive ; each attack move is more elaborate and more extravagant on the ' Cube . " Nintendo Power thought similarly , commending the " amazing level of detail " . 
 GameZone compared the overall town design and environments to those of the landmark Final Fantasy VII . Dingo complained that " there are some characters to talk to and chests to find , but no ' overworld ' with free @-@ roaming monsters to capture . " John K. stated that " [ t ] he towns are made with enough detail , but sometimes a bit dull . " 
 Harris denounced the game 's usage of old Pokémon battle cries , a recurring complaint of the series . Dingo called the music as a whole " a bit too low @-@ tech and synthetic " . GameZone , in contrast , stated that the sound effects evoke nostalgia for Pokémon Red and Blue , and that the music tracks " have more depth than any of the songs from the previous Pokemon [ sic ] games . " John K. said that the music is neither annoying nor entertaining . Retronauts described Colosseum as " terrible " , citing the reuse of graphics from the Pokémon Stadium games . 
 In 2006 , Nintendo Power listed Colosseum as the 121st greatest video game to appear on a Nintendo console .

The game was followed by a 2005 sequel entitled Pokémon XD : Gale of Darkness . Set in Orre five years after Colosseum , it features a new protagonist snagging Shadow Pokémon from Team Cipher . Shadow Lugia is the game 's mascot , and serves as an antagonist whom the player can snag . The game alludes to Wes , Rui , and The Under , though they do not appear . 
 = Do or Die ( Super Furry Animals song ) = 
 " Do or Die " is the eleventh single by Super Furry Animals . It was the last single to be taken from the Guerrilla album and was the band 's last release for Creation Records . The track reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart after its release on 17 January 2000 . The group had originally wanted to release " Wherever I Lay My Phone ( That 's My Home ) " as the final single from Guerilla but Creation instead chose " Do or Die " , a decision which the band claimed not to understand . 
 Although " Do or Die " features " daft lyrics " , its name was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi 's Quit India speech which called for Indians to " Do or Die " to end British Imperial rule in the country . Critical reaction was largely positive with the song being named ' Single of the Week ' by the Melody Maker and appearing at number 55 in the NME 's single of the year list for 2000 despite an earlier claim by the magazine that there was " no need whatsoever " to release the track as a single . The music video for " Do or Die " was directed by Jake & Jim and features live action footage of the group 's heads on brightly coloured cartoon bodies . 
 = = Themes and recording = = 
 According to Gruff Rhys " Do or Die " has a " ridiculously positive outlook " and was written in an attempt to " kickstart [ the band ] back into gear " after a bad period in the singer 's life . The track is a " driving song " and features sampled car noises so that " even if you 're not in a car it feels like you are " . Although Rhys has called the track a " dumb pop song " with " really daft " lyrics , he has also claimed that the title was inspired by the Quit India speech made by Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942 at the <unk> Tank in Bombay in which Gandhi called for his countrymen to " Do or Die " and use non @-@ violent resistance to end British Imperial rule in India . Rhys has stated that he feels the fact that " five @-@ year @-@ olds " can jump up and down to the song , singing " Gandhi lyrics " , is important , as it contrasts with the " self @-@ important ... pompous " lyrics of singers such as Jim Morrison and Robert Plant . The track was recorded in the middle of 1998 at Real World Studios , Box , Wiltshire , along with the rest of Guerrilla , and was produced by Super Furry Animals . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Do or Die " is 1 minute and 59 seconds long and is in the key of A major . The instruments used on the track are tuned slightly sharper than standard . The song begins with an intro featuring a lead guitar and keyboard melody , which plays twice , accompanied by a rhythm guitar riff alternating between A and D chords , drums and bass . The track breaks down to just rhythm guitar , drums and bass for the first verse which begins after 13 seconds . The first chorus begins after 23 seconds with a distorted guitar playing the chord sequence D5 , C5 , B ♭ 5 and A5 twice while Rhys sings " If we do or die we should try , if we don 't try I say bye @-@ bye , and if I say bye @-@ bye , I 'll wonder why we didn 't try to do or die " backed by high harmony backing vocals and occasional keyboard noises . The song breaks down again for a second verse before the second chorus enters at 46 seconds . An instrumental passage follows with the lead guitar and keyboard reprising the melody which plays during the intro . The instrumental leads into a double chorus . At the end of the final chorus the track crescendos , with Rhys singing " yeah , yeah , yeah " and all instruments with the exception of the keyboard coming to an abrupt silence after 1 minute and 43 seconds . Keyboard noises continue and gradually fade out until the track ends .

 The Super Furry Animals had originally intended to issue the song " Wherever I Lay My Phone ( That 's My Home ) " as the third single from Guerrilla but , on returning from an American tour in 1999 , found that their record company , Creation , had not done any work regarding the release . Returning from a tour of Europe later the same year the band discovered that both their record label and record plugging company had folded and that Creation made the decision , first to release " Night Vision " instead of " Wherever I Lay My Phone ( That 's My Home ) " , and then to replace " Night Vision " with " Do or Die " as the last single from Guerrilla . Singer Gruff Rhys has expressed dissatisfaction with this choice , claiming that he is not sure how the decision was made and that he wanted " Wherever I Lay My Phone ( That 's My Home ) " to be released as he " quite fancied the idea of a novelty hit " . However , the group ultimately felt " Wherever I Lay My Phone ( That 's My Home ) " could not be issued in any case following the December 1999 release of " I Wanna 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 1 With You " by Jimmy Cauty 's Solid Gold <unk> , which was " based on the same Nokia ringtone " . 
 " Do or Die " was issued on CD , cassette and 7 " on 17 January 2000 , the band 's last release for Creation , and reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart . The track became the shortest song ever to be performed on the BBC 's Top Of The Pops programme when the group appeared on the show to promote the single 's release . The track was included on the band 's ' greatest hits ' compilation album Songbook : The Singles , Vol . 1 , issued in 2004 . 
 " Do or Die " was awarded ' Single of the Week ' in the January 19 – 25 , 2000 issue of the Melody Maker by guest reviewers Pär <unk> and Christina <unk> from The <unk> who gave the track " all the points we can afford " and claimed that it ends perfectly . The NME described the song as " not the best track from ... Guerrilla , but then not the worst either " and claimed that it was mostly of note because it was the second single by Super Furry Animals to be less than two minutes long following 1996 's " God ! Show Me Magic " . Despite stating that there was " no need whatsoever " for the release , the NME ranked " Do or Die " at number 55 in their single of the year list for 2000 . In a 2005 review of the reissued Guerrilla , Pitchfork described the track as " near @-@ perfect sunny pop " while , in an earlier review of Songbook : The Singles , Vol . 1 , the website called " Do or Die " " proggy quasi @-@ Britpop " and likened its guitar part to " Jessica " by The Allman Brothers Band . Also reviewing Songbook ... , the BBC described " Do or Die " as one of several " great hairy rock outs " on the record , The Washington Post called it " straightforward pop @-@ punk " and Drowned in Sound labelled it a " guitar @-@ laden sugar rush " . Website Cokemachineglow likened the track to the work of The Stooges . Pitchfork claimed that the single 's b @-@ sides , the " inescapably sha @-@ la @-@ la @-@ ing ' Colorblind ' " and the " piano @-@ accented bounder " " <unk> ( sic ) " , pale beside " Do or Die " and the other tracks on Guerilla although they " do manage to scratch the itch for more SFA " .

 A promotional music video was produced to accompany the release of " Do or Die " as a single .

The video begins with the camera zooming in through the door of a cartoon house in the desert to reveal Super Furry Animals playing along to the track in a room . The band 's heads and instruments are live action footage , filmed in London , while their bodies and surroundings are brightly coloured animations . During the first verse , shots of the group playing the track in the room are intercut with images of band members on cartoon surfboards superimposed onto real life footage of giant waves . This process is repeated during the second chorus , with the video cutting between shots of the band playing in the room and images of the band superimposed onto live footage of tornados . After 1 minute and 4 seconds images of the group 's heads being swept along in a lava flow are intercut with the band playing along with the track in the now red room with lava visible through the windows .

 " SexyBack " is a song recorded by American singer @-@ songwriter Justin Timberlake for his second studio album , FutureSex / LoveSounds ( 2006 ) . It was released on July 18 , 2006 , to US mainstream and rhythmic radio stations by Jive Records as the lead single from the album . The song was written and produced by Nate Hills , Tim Mosley , and Timberlake himself . Discussing " SexyBack " , Timberlake revealed that he went " left " , singing the song in a rock style , not an R & B style . He described the song as musicians David Bowie and David Byrne " covering " James Brown 's 1970 song " Sex Machine " . The track features Timbaland on backing vocals , while Timberlake 's voice is distorted . The instrumentation used in the song includes a pounding bass beat , electronic chords , and drum machine sounds . 
 " SexyBack " became Timberlake 's first number @-@ one single on the Billboard Hot 100 , staying seven weeks at the top spot . It also topped several of Billboard magazine 's other charts , including the Billboard Pop 100 , Hot Dance Airplay , and Hot Digital Songs charts , and entered the top ten on most singles charts . Internationally , it became Timberlake 's first single to reach number one in the United Kingdom . In Australia , the track was Timberlake 's second number @-@ one single , spending two consecutive weeks at the top . " SexyBack " was certified three @-@ times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and three @-@ times platinum by Canadian Recording Industry Association ( CRIA ) . " SexyBack " is one of the best selling singles of all time . 
 The track won Best Dance Recording at the 2007 Grammy Awards . In addition , the song won Timberlake the People 's Choice Award for Favorite R & B song and the Male Artist of the Year at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards . The music video was filmed in June 2006 ; Timberlake decided to work with director Michael Haussman based on the latter 's work on Madonna 's 1994 music video " Take a Bow " .

 Timberlake began working on his second studio album , FutureSex / LoveSounds , in December 2005 . Within three weeks , " SexyBack " was one of several songs that were recorded for the album , having been recorded in less than a day . Timberlake told The Weekend Mail in 2006 that it was the " second or third song " he did with Timbaland in a list of 10 songs they recorded for the album . The song was written and produced by Justin Timberlake , Timbaland , and Nate " Danja " Hills , and mixed by Jimmy Douglass , using Pro Tools . Mixing took place in April 2006 , using a Neve VR @-@ series console . 
 Hills played the Akai MPC3000 and other virtual synths on his Macintosh computer , while Timbaland performed instruments on the Ensoniq ASR @-@ 10 sampling keyboard . Bill Pettaway played the guitar , which his part was recorded in two minutes , while Darryl Pearson was the bassist . Both the guitar and bass were digitally imported in Pro Tools during mixing , and only a section of the guitar recording was copied and pasted throughout the song .

 Timberlake described " SexyBack " as " an experiment gone right from the sort of synthesizer influence to the distorted vocals " , adding that it was " one of the songs that the more you listen to it its just hook after hook after hook . Its just one of those ' flow off the top of your head ' tracks , in terms of melody . We wanted to keep it loose and not too rehearsed , it 's one of those very experimental records though . " Timberlake revealed that he went " left " , regarding going more rock , not in how he developed the song , but in the way he sang the song . " I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer , not an R & B singer . That 's the approach . " The day before recording , Timberlake and Timbaland had listened to David Bowie 's " Rebel Rebel " and the Rapture 's " House of Jealous Lovers " . Timberlake wanted to achieve the songs ' " raw energy " . Timberlake said that he modeled himself on Bowie and Prince , and described the song as Bowie and David Byrne " covering " James Brown 's 1970 song " Sex Machine " . Timberlake said that the song " doesn 't qualify as rock or straight funk " and that he was happy with the description " club funk " . He was " keen for a new musical direction " following the release of his first album , Justified . " I listened to the radio for a few months and thought , ' All this sounds like shit , what do I want to hear ? ' . That 's really all I did . Everything 's [ sic ] got so repetitive , everything sounds the same . I had to create something unique otherwise there 's no point putting it out . " 
 " SexyBack " is an " urgent , pulsing track , a cocktail of soaring , distorted vocals and heavy , electronic chords threaded together with rap " , according to Camilla Long from The Observer . The song is composed in the key of A Phrygian dominant mode — and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 117 beats per minute . The song features a pounding bass beat and electronic sounds , and does not include Timberlake 's " famous falsetto " . The song 's musicscape includes two @-@ note dirty electronic riffs , " leapfrogging keyboards " , beat box sound , and incorporates the " same leaky faucet " sounds of musician Obie Trice 's 2004 song " The Setup " . In addition , the track features Timbaland on backing vocals . 
 Timberlake 's voice in the song is processed , slowed down to where his voice is unrecognizable , with muffled vocals . The song also features Timberlake 's " low register distorted vocals . " Timberlake revealed that the vocals in the song were influenced by Prince .

 Douglas explained the title of the song , and how it affected the concept : 
 " Justin [ Timberlake ] goes in the chorus ' Go head be gone with it ' , I called the song ' Be Gone With It ' , just to label it . So they 're developing this song and they 're going nuts and loving it , and as they play it , and I 'm like : ' I don 't think this hook is strong enough . ' But then , at the very last minute , Justin very , very cleverly decided to call it ' <unk> ' , and that changed the whole dimension of the song . The first thing you hear when you listen to the song is ' I 'm bringing sexy back ' , and after that you don 't care or don 't notice that there is no hook . And then there 's the unique thing of Timbaland acting as a narrator , saying things like ' take it to the bridge ' , or ' yeah ' . Every time Justin leaves a space , he fills it in . It 's two guys interacting . " 
 Timberlake said that the chorus was " very James Brown @-@ ish , call out and repeat , like ' Sex Machine ' . " He wrote the track " from top to bottom . ' I 'm bringing sexy back , yeah ! I 'm bringing . . . ' It 's a very physical song , meant to provoke ... sexual dance . ' Sex Machine ' is the closest reference . " Timberlake said that the lyric , " bringing sexy back " , was one of the first lines he came up with . In addition , he admitted that the song was not going to be titled " SexyBack " , saying , " We weren 't originally going to call it ' SexyBack ' . I definitely didn 't think it would become the most worn @-@ out phrase of 2006 . It just sounded like a nice opening to the song . " 
 Adam Graham of The Detroit News noted that Timberlake sings about whips and chains , while Bill Lamb of About.com said the song has a " bit of s & m tease about shackles and whips " . Furthermore , The Georgia Straight 's Martin Turenne said that Timberlake is " shackled to the bedpost , invites the crack of his mistress 's whip . " Ben Williams of New York magazine wrote that Timberlake had been working on his pickup lines , with " You see these shackles baby I 'm your slave / I 'll let you whip me if I misbehave . " Jason Bracelin of the Las Vegas Review @-@ Journal reported that Timberlake sings about " threatening to steal your girl . " Charlie Brooker for The Guardian , in regards to the lyric , " them other fuckers don 't know how to act " , writing that Timberlake 's translation is of him telling everyone in the world that they are a " clueless <unk> " . Further in his report , Brooker opined that Timberlake " threatens us " by using " language so offensive " with the line , " You motherfuckers , watch how I attack " . In addition , Brooker noted that the line , " If that 's your girl you 'd better watch your back " , as Timberlake stating his intention to meddle in the private affairs of others . Barry Schwartz of Stylus noted that the song features " pillow talk " , in reference of the song 's " sex @-@ crazed lyrics " .

 In the Billboard magazine review of the album , contributor Katy Kroll wrote that Timberlake " claims to be bringing ' sexy ' back to pop music , and indeed he is . You can almost feel beads of sweat rolling off the title track and ' SexyBack ' featuring Timbaland " . Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly was complimentary towards Timbaland , producer of the song , writing that Timbaland offers " tougher , trickier rhythms , minimal live playing , a plethora of hip @-@ hop cameos , and a self @-@ consciously hard , edgy club sensibility " to " SexyBack " . Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald noted , " The producer 's angular synthesizer crunch is all over it – at best on the single ' SexyBack ' where they dispense with a chorus , leaving the song sustained by its vocal fireworks , electrofunk and Timberlake 's repeated declaration that ' I 'm bringing sexy back . ' " PopMatters ' contributor Quentin B. Huff wrote that " SexyBack " was the " fraternal twin " to Nelly Furtado 's 2006 song " Promiscuous " . Andrew Murfett of The Age wrote that the song was a " raunchy club banger that slyly suppresses " Timberlake 's customary falsetto . He continues , " it 's introduced a new phrase into the pop cultural lexicon " . Glenn Gamboa of Newsday was complimentary towards the song , writing that it was " Timberlake at his best , mainstreaming a combination of the wild , edgy dance @-@ pop style of Basement Jaxx with Missy Elliott 's more experimental hip @-@ hop to create a boldly inventive sound that still pleases the masses . " 
 Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote : " ... ' SexyBack ' , a twitchy , emaciated track that shot to the top of the charts and also became an irritating catchphrase . ( Suddenly everyone was bringing <unk> . ) " Dagny Salas of North by Northwestern commented that Timberlake and Timbaland trade ridiculous lines , with " Get your sexy on / Go ahead , be gone with it " and " Dirty babe / You see these shackles / Baby I ’ m your slave / I ’ ll let you whip me if I misbehave . " Salas continued in her review that it was not a song that should be good , " but does that really matter when it ’ s Good in the way that songs are during the summer [ ... ] That kind of good makes songs like ' SexyBack ' completely irresistible . " Matt Burns of The Post wrote , " Take the polarizing summer single ' SexyBack ' , a repetitive song with little structure that doesn 't know when to stop , all centered on a ridiculous declaration . Somehow , it works . " The Diamondback 's Michael Greenwald reported that " SexyBack " was " lyrically , musically and vocally the weakest song " on the album . A writer of The State Journal @-@ Register was not impressed with the song and concluded , with " ' SexyBack ' is the most annoyingly dumb song to hit Billboard 's No. 1 since ' Hollaback Girl ' " . Guy Blackman of The Sunday Age wrote : " The distorted vocals and stilted production of first single ' <unk> ' make Timberlake 's claim to be ' bringing sexy back ' ... seem almost laughable . " Entertainment Weekly put it on its end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ decade , " best @-@ of " list , saying , " Justin Timberlake We didn 't even know that sexy was missing until 2006 . We 're just happy Justin brought it back safe and sound . " Charlie Brooker , columnist for The Guardian , jokingly criticised Timberlake , saying " How DARE this dot @-@ eyed , crop @-@ haired , fun @-@ sized , guff @-@ tongued , pirouetting waif @-@ boy scamper on to the world 's airwaves and loudly proclaim to be the sole global administrator of all things sexy ? You 'd think it takes massive balls to do something like that , but given the shrill , squeaking vocals <unk> through his ghastly little <unk> , it 's safe to assume he 's got testes the size of capers . He 's practically a human dog whistle , the shrieking , high @-@ pitched , mosquito @-@ lunged <unk> . " 
 Upon the song 's release , it received divided opinions , which pleased Timberlake . " This is such a departure from the first record , " said Timberlake . " More people might like it , less people might like it , but you can 't call me a chicken . "

 " SexyBack " helped introduce EDM sounds to top 40 radio , as it brought together variations of electronic dance music with Timberlake ’ s R & B sounds . VH1 listed it 3rd on their list of the " 100 Greatest Songs of the ’ 00s , " while Los Angeles Times listed it as an honorable mention among " the most timeless tunes of the 2000s " , with an editor stating it " sounded wholly unfamiliar and unique . " Entertainment Weekly deemed it a " modern day classic . " 
 " SexyBack " won the People 's Choice Award for Favorite R & B song at the 2007 awards ceremony . At the 49th Grammy Awards , " SexyBack " won a Grammy Award in the category of Best Dance Recording . At the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards , Timberlake won Male Artist of the Year for " SexyBack " , " Let Me Talk To You / My Love " , and " What Goes Around ... Comes Around " .

 The music video for " SexyBack " was directed by Michael Haussman and features Spanish actress Elena Anaya . The video was filmed in June 2006 and shot in a luxury building in Barcelona , Spain . In discussion of the video filmed in Barcelona , Timberlake said : " Obviously we went for the architecture , the exteriors , the interiors — the vibe in Spain is different than anywhere else in the world . It 's so cool to shoot there , but the girls are also pretty hot , so that doesn 't hurt either " . 
 Timberlake decided to work with director Michael Haussman , following his work on Madonna 's 1994 music video for " Take a Bow " . " It 's one of my favorite videos Madonna 's ever done , " Timberlake said . " Even today , I still remember the visuals , the images , how he captured her . A lot of times , Madonna seems like she 's the person in control , and in that video , she seemed vulnerable . It was a cool thing to see . " The video was first shown on MTV 's Making the Video on July 25 , 2006 . 
 The video starts off with a cable car looking over a large city ( Barcelona , from the West looking East ) while a German newscast featuring Alexander von Roon plays on TV and switches to a luxurious @-@ looking hotel in Plaça de Catalunya with Elena Anaya taking off her sweater . It then cuts to Timberlake in a different room ; then to a club scene and Timberlake in front of a white background . The video alternates between those four viewpoints , with Timberlake and Anaya seeming to be spies in the hotel room and strangers in the club . At a certain point , Timberlake goes over to Anaya 's room by jumping over to her balcony . Then when Anaya goes to check it out , Timberlake traps and passionately has sex with her . In the club , it ends with Timberlake kissing Anaya in a bathroom stall . In the hotel room scene , Timberlake leaves by the same way he entered and moments later jumps to the next balcony before an explosion ensues . It ends with the figure of Anaya sitting in a chair beside a small television in which a kiss is frozen on the screen .

 = Rebellion of Cao Qin = 
 The Rebellion of Cao Qin ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) was a day @-@ long uprising in the Ming Dynasty capital of Beijing on August 7 , 1461 , staged by Chinese general Cao Qin ( <unk> ; d . 1461 ) and his Ming troops of Mongol and Han descent against the Tianshun Emperor ( 1457 – 1464 ) . The rebellion was orchestrated by Cao and his officers due to fear of being next on Tianshun 's purge @-@ list of those who helped him gain back the throne from his half @-@ brother the Jingtai Emperor , who had earlier succeeded during the 1449 Tumu Crisis . The leaked plot of rebellion was a failure , three of Cao 's brothers were killed during the ensuing battle , and Cao Qin was forced to commit suicide during the effort of a last stand against imperial troops storming his Beijing residential compound . The rebellion marked the high point in political tension over allowing Mongols to be employed in the Ming military command structure . Ming Chinese officials often made recompense with Mongol subordinates for military merits while at the same time strategically relocating their troops and families away from the capital . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the Ming Dynasty ( 1368 – 1644 ) , the Mongols enrolled in military service were either originally prisoners of war or they were those who voluntarily submitted to the Ming and settled in China . Others fled their homeland on the northern steppe due to natural disasters such as droughts , seeking refuge in China where Mongol families found lodging and hospitality . Some Mongols became distinguished military officers , were granted noble ranks , and on rarer occasions became ministers in the state bureaucracy . Mongols of noble lineage socialized with Chinese literati of the two capitals ( Nanjing and Beijing ) while they also had their sons educated in the Chinese classic texts . Nonetheless , Mongols in the Ming Empire were often held in suspicion by Chinese Ming authorities . Mongols of lower social stature were often accused by Chinese officials of being prone to violence , banditry , and becoming beggars and even prostitutes . Ming officials used the excuse of military campaigns to relocate and scatter Mongol troops and families throughout China so that they would not be concentrated in North China ( which neighbored the enemy territory of the Mongol heartland ) . Wu <unk> argues that there was a noticeable shift in Ming court policies after the 1449 Tumu Crisis in dealing with the Mongols ; he stated that beforehand the Ming court actively encouraged Mongol immigration , and afterwards merely managed those who had already sided with the Ming . 
 On July 20 , 1461 , after Mongols had staged raids in June into Ming territory along the northern tracts of the Yellow River , the Minister of War Ma Ang ( <unk> ; 1399 – 1476 ) and General Sun Tang ( <unk> ; d . 1471 ) were appointed to lead a force of 15 @,@ 000 troops to bolster the defenses of Shaanxi . Historian David M. Robinson states that " these developments must also have fed suspicion about Mongols living in North China , which in turn exacerbated Mongol feelings of insecurity . However , no direct link can be found between the decision by the Ming Mongols in Beijing to join the [ 1461 ] coup and activities of steppe Mongols in the northwest . " 
 = = Day before the coup = = 
 On August 6 , 1461 , the Tianshun Emperor issued an edict telling his nobles and generals to be loyal to the throne ; this was in effect a veiled threat to Cao Qin , after the latter had his associate in the Imperial Guard murdered to cover up crimes of illegal foreign transactions . This soldier in the imperial guard had acted as Cao 's private commercial agent , but when this man failed to keep affairs secret , Cao had the soldier 's wife tell authorities that her husband had gone mad and fled . Lu Gao ( <unk> ; d . 1461 ) , head officer of the Imperial Guard , had authorities apprehend the missing soldier with approval of the Emperor , whereupon Cao had his former commercial agent beaten to death before authorities could reach him . 
 The General Shi Heng ( <unk> ; d . 1459 ) , who aided Tianshun 's succession , starved to death in prison after a similar warning from an imperial edict ; his son Shi Biao ( <unk> ) was executed in 1460 . Cao Qin was to take no chances in allowing himself to be ruined in similar fashion . Cao 's Mongol troops were veterans who had fought in several campaigns under the eunuch Cao Jixiang ( <unk> ) — Cao Qin 's adoptive father — in the 1440s . The loyalty of Cao 's Mongol @-@ officer clients was secure due to circumstances of thousands of military officers who had to accept demotions in 1457 because of earlier promotions in aiding Jingtai 's succession . Robinson states that " Mongol officers no doubt expected that if Cao fell from power , they would soon follow . " 
 Cao either planned to kill Ma Ang and Sun Tang as they were to depart the capital with 15 @,@ 000 troops to Shaanxi on the morning of August 7 , or he simply planned to take advantage of their leave . The conspirators are said to have planned to place their heir apparent on the throne and demote Tianshun 's position to " grand senior emperor " , the title delegated to him during the years of his house arrest from 1450 to 1457 , under Jingtai 's rule . 
 = = Murder of Lu Gao and Li Xian 's memorial = = 
 While Cao held a banquet for his Mongol officers on the night of August 6 , two of his Mongol officers slipped away from the festivity and leaked Cao 's plot to the high @-@ level Mongol commanders Wu Jin ( <unk> ) and Wu Cong ( <unk> ) around 1 : 00 am to 3 : 00 am in the morning of August 7 . Wu Jin alerted General Sun Tang about the plot , and soon after Sun alerted the emperor with a message slipped through the Western Chang 'an Gate . Upon receiving this warning , the Emperor arrested the eunuch conspirator Cao Jixiang and had all nine gates of Beijing and all four gates of the Forbidden City blockaded . Meanwhile , Cao Qin began to suspect that the plot was leaked , and so moved with his troops around 5 : 00 to 7 : 00 am in the morning of August 7 to inspect the gates of the Imperial City ; when the Dongan Gate ( the eastern entrance ) failed to open , his suspicions were confirmed . 
 While his forces searched for Ma Ang and Sun Tang , Cao visited the home of Lu Gao , head of the Imperial Guard who led the efforts to investigate Cao Jixiang and Cao Qin , and killed Lu in his own home ( decapitating and dismembering him ) . After killing Lu Gao , Cao Qin found and detained the Grand Secretary Li Xian ( <unk> ; 1408 – 1467 ) , showing him the severed head of Lu Gao and explaining that Lu had driven him to rebellion . Li Xian agreed to draft a memorial to the throne explaining that Cao Qin wished the emperor no harm , that his vengeance against Lu Gao was finished , and asked for an imperial pardon . Cao 's men had also detained the Minister of Personnel , Wang Ao ( <unk> ; 1384 – 1467 ) , and using writing materials from his office Li and Wang composed the memorial . Wang and Li slipped the message through the door panels of the gate to the Imperial City , but the gates remained tightly shut , so Cao Qin began calling for the death of Li Xian . Wang Ao and Wan Qi ( <unk> ; d . 1484 ) , a director of the Ministry of Personnel , dissuaded Cao Qin from killing Li , noting Li had written the funerary inscription for Cao 's adopted father Jixiang . 
 = = The failed coup and inner city battle = = 
 After Li 's message was unable to get through , Cao Qin began the assault on Dongan Gate , East Chang 'an Gate and West Chang 'an Gate , setting fire to the western and eastern gates ; these fires were extinguished later in the day by pouring rain . Defending these gates were 5 @,@ 610 imperial bodyguards , who were generously rewarded after the conflict for their merit in maintaining a strong defense . Ming troops poured into the area outside the Imperial City to counterattack ; Li Xian and Wang Ao were able to flee , but Wu Jin and the head of the Censorate , Kou Shen ( <unk> ; 1391 – 1461 ) , were killed by Cao 's soldiers . Kou had earlier denounced Cao as a criminal and was an associate of Lu Gao ; when Cao 's soldiers found Kou in a waiting room outside Chang 'an Gate , he cursed at them before they cut him down . 
 General Sun led the charge against Cao Qin right outside Donghua Gate , while Ma Ang approached Cao Qin 's forces from the rear in a flank . Cao was forced to withdraw and set up temporary camp at Dongan Gate . By midday , Sun Tang 's forces had killed two of Cao Qin 's brothers ( Sun personally shot the second with an arrow after Cao Qin 's brother led cavalry charges against imperial troops ) . Sun 's forces had also severely wounded Cao Qin in both his arms ; his forces took up position in the Great Eastern Market and Lantern Market northeast of Dongan Gate , while Sun deployed artillery units against the rebels . Cao lost his third brother , Cao Duo ( <unk> ) , while attempting to flee out of Beijing by the Chaoyang Gate . Cao made another dash for the northeastern gates of the capital ( Anding Gate and <unk> Gate ) , and then back to Chaoyang Gate , all of which remained closed . Finally , Cao fled with his remaining forces to fortify his residential compound in Beijing . Ming troops under Sun Tang and the newly arrived Marquis of <unk> , Sun <unk> ( <unk> ) , stormed the residence . To avoid arrest and execution , Cao Qin committed suicide by throwing himself down a well . Imperial troops recovered his body and then decapitated it . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As promised by Grand Secretary Li Xian before the final assault on the Cao residence , imperial troops were allowed to confiscate for themselves what they could find from Cao Qin 's property . Li had also given another incentive that any imperial soldier who captured a rebel would be rewarded with the same title and office their captive had . Those found to be followers of Cao Qin were soon after executed , including members of the Imperial Guard and the <unk> Guard on August 22 , 1461 . On August 8 , Cao Jixiang was publicly dismembered , a sentence and execution which ministers of state were made aware of by the Tianshun Emperor once he held an audience at the Median Gate . The dismembered corpses of Cao Qin and his brothers were left outside and exposed to the elements . Cao 's father @-@ in @-@ law was spared from punishment since it was known that he had refused to communicate with Cao Qin during the latter 's rise to power as a career general . 
 The Tianshun Emperor spared some of the culprits the sentence of death by commuting their sentence to imprisonment instead ; this included Vice Commissioner @-@ in @-@ chief Esen <unk> , who lowered himself down the city walls of Beijing and was later found in a farmer 's melon patch as far as Tongzhou District . Others were exiled to Lingnan to " suffer the inhospitable tropical climate for the remainder of their lives , " according to Robinson . Li Xian also pressured the Emperor to pardon and exonerate " those who had been forced to join " Cao 's rebellion . 
 Rewards were given to those who captured the escapees of the plot , including Chen Kui , Grand Defender of Tianjin , who was promoted . On August 9 , the Mongol officer Wu Cong was put in charge of the Chief Military Commission of the Left ; in September , twenty taels of silver and two @-@ hundred <unk> of grain were added to his stipend . Ma Ang was made the Junior Guardian of the Heir Apparent in September . Plaques were made to commemorate the dead who fought against Cao Qin . 
 Besides the handling of punishments and rewards , the court made other efforts to reestablish order in the capital region . <unk> taxes were suspended . Nobles of the imperial clan patrolled the gates of the imperial city while rebels were still at large . Some residents in Beijing abused the order that they alert authorities of remaining culprits of the coup in order to label personal enemies as " rebels " to take their property . To discourage this , the emperor had several dozen of these looters beaten and paraded through the streets as criminals . In an edict of August 9 , the Emperor reassured loyal Mongol officers of Baoding that Mongol participation in Cao 's rebellion did not mean persecution for them . In October , Mi Duo @-@ duo @-@ lai , commander of Baoding and veteran Mongol officer who fought against Esen <unk> 's 1449 invasion , was ordered to stay put in Baoding , a gesture by the emperor that there was no need to worry about loss of authority . 
 Three weeks after Cao Qin 's failed uprising , the Mongol leader <unk> , who had been staging raids into northern China , sent an embassy into China to request formal tribute relations and to serve as a vassal to the Ming . News of this rebellion reached the Joseon court of Korea by September 9 , while the Korean official in charge of the report perhaps embellished the level of gore and violence by stating that tens of thousands had died and the three days of pouring rain following the rebellion flooded even the Forbidden City with streams of blood and rain . A native rebellion would not threaten the capital city again until the fall of Beijing to the army of Li Zicheng in 1644 , marking the end of the dynasty and , shortly after , the beginning of Manchu conquest . Until the conquest of the Manchu Qing Dynasty , Chinese officials continued to show a large degree of apprehension over Mongols in military service to the Ming , and still favored relocation schemes . However , Cao 's rebellion marked the last event when Ming Mongols were of great importance to court affairs ; although many Mongol officers retained hereditary titles of noble lineage , the nobility within the military command structure declined as a whole while men from more humble origins eventually displaced them .

 The general Chinese history texts on the Ming Dynasty , including the <unk> Shi and the Mingshi , briefly mention Cao Qin 's failed coup of 1461 .

 The historian Meng Sen ( 1868 – 1938 ) , who compiled , edited , and commented on texts dealing with the Ming and Qing eras , stressed that Tianshun was an incompetent ruler for having allowed Shi Heng and Cao Jixiang to develop into formidable threats to central rule . Henry <unk> , whom Robinson calls " the most authoritative writer on the Ming Mongols " , did not mention this rebellion in any of his written works . Historians Tang Gang and Nan <unk> remark in their 1985 publication of the Mingshi that the 1461 coup weakened the power of Ming rule . The historian David M. Robinson devoted the article Politics , Force and Ethnicity in Ming China to the subject of Cao Qin 's rebellion and the Ming Mongols . The historian Okuyama Norio wrote an essay in 1977 arguing that Cao Qin 's coup of 1461 should be understood as a single event in the wider context of continuous power struggles between civil officials and military officers during Tianshun 's reign . 
 = Zinc = 
 Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element in group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : the ion is of similar size and the only common oxidation state is + 2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest workable lodes are in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc is refining by froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) . 
 Brass , an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions , was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean , Iraq , the United Arab Emirates , <unk> , Turkmenistan and Georgia , and the second millennium BC in West India , Uzbekistan , Iran , Syria , Iraq , and Israel ( Judea ) . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " . 
 The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion @-@ resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot @-@ dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in electrical batteries , small non @-@ structural castings , and alloys such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti @-@ dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory . 
 Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children , deficiency causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .

 Zinc is a bluish @-@ white , lustrous , diamagnetic metal , though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish . It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure , with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing , in which each atom has six nearest neighbors ( at 265 @.@ 9 pm ) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290 @.@ 6 pm . The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 ° C. Above 210 ° C , the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating . Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity . For a metal , zinc has relatively low melting ( 419 @.@ 5 ° C ) and boiling points ( 907 ° C ) . The melting point is the lowest of all the transition metals aside from mercury and cadmium . 
 Many alloys contain zinc , including brass . Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium , antimony , bismuth , gold , iron , lead , mercury , silver , tin , magnesium , cobalt , nickel , tellurium and sodium . Although neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic , their alloy <unk> 
 2 exhibits ferromagnetism below 35 K. 
 A bar of zinc generates a characteristic sound when bent , similar to tin cry .

 Zinc makes up about 75 ppm ( 0 @.@ 0075 % ) of Earth 's crust , making it the 24th most abundant element . Soil contains zinc in 5 – 770 ppm with an average 64 ppm . Seawater has only 30 ppb and the atmosphere , 0 @.@ 1 – 4 µg / m3 . 
 The element is normally found in association with other base metals such as copper and lead in ores . Zinc is a chalcophile , meaning the element has a low affinity for oxides and prefers to bond with sulfides . <unk> formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth 's atmosphere . <unk> , which is a form of zinc sulfide , is the most heavily mined zinc @-@ containing ore because its concentrate contains 60 – 62 % zinc . 
 Other source minerals for zinc include <unk> ( zinc carbonate ) , <unk> ( zinc silicate ) , wurtzite ( another zinc sulfide ) , and sometimes <unk> ( basic zinc carbonate ) . With the exception of wurtzite , all these other minerals were formed by weathering of the primordial zinc sulfides . 
 Identified world zinc resources total about 1 @.@ 9 billion tonnes . Large deposits are in Australia , Canada and the United States , with the largest reserves in Iran . At the current rate of consumption , one source has estimated those reserves could be depleted between 2027 and 2055 . About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002 , and scholars for the National Academy of Sciences estimate that about 109 million tonnes are in use .

Similarly , <unk> ( 0 @.@ 6 % ) , with a half @-@ life of 1 @.@ 3 × 1016 a is not usually considered to be radioactive . The other isotopes found in nature are <unk> ( 28 % ) , <unk> ( 4 % ) and <unk> ( 19 % ) . 
 Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized . 65Zn , which has a half @-@ life of 243 @.@ 66 days , is the least active radioisotope , followed by <unk> with a half @-@ life of 46 @.@ 5 hours . Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers . <unk> has the longest half @-@ life , 13 @.@ 76 h . The superscript m indicates a metastable isotope .

 Zinc has an electron configuration of [ Ar ] <unk> and is a member of the group 12 of the periodic table . It is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent . The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly , eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate , Zn 
 5 ( OH ) 
 6 ( CO3 ) 
 2 , by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide . This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water . 
 Zinc burns in air with a bright bluish @-@ green flame , giving off fumes of zinc oxide . Zinc reacts readily with acids , alkalis and other non @-@ metals . Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room temperature with acids . Strong acids , such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid , can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas . 
 The chemistry of zinc is dominated by the + 2 oxidation state . When compounds in this oxidation state are formed , the outer shell s electrons are lost , yielding a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [ Ar ] <unk> . In aqueous solution an octahedral complex , [ Zn ( H 
 2O ) 6 ] 2 + is the predominant species . The volatilization of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285 ° C indicates the formation of Zn 
 2Cl 
 2 , a zinc compound with a + 1 oxidation state . No compounds of zinc in oxidation states other than + 1 or + 2 are known . Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of + 4 is unlikely to exist . 
 Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first @-@ row transition metals , nickel and copper , though it has a filled d @-@ shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless . The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical . Because of this some , of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure , and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor , the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium . In other respects , there is little similarity with the late first @-@ row transition metals . Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of <unk> and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors . Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5 @-@ coordinate complexes are known . 
 = = = Zinc ( I ) compounds = = = 
 Zinc ( I ) compounds are rare and require bulky ligands to stabilize the low oxidation state . Most zinc ( I ) compounds contain formally the [ Zn2 ] 2 + core , which is analogous to the [ Hg2 ] 2 + dimeric cation present in mercury ( I ) compounds . The diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure . The first zinc ( I ) compound containing the Zn — Zn bond , ( η5 @-@ C5Me5 ) <unk> , is also the first <unk> . The [ Zn2 ] 2 + ion rapidly disproportionates into zinc metal and zinc ( II ) , and has been obtained only a yellow glass only by cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl2 .

 Binary compounds of zinc are known for most of the metalloids and all the nonmetals except the noble gases . The oxide ZnO is a white powder that is nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions , but is amphoteric , dissolving in both strong basic and acidic solutions . The other chalcogenides ( ZnS , ZnSe , and ZnTe ) have varied applications in electronics and optics . <unk> ( Zn

 In weak basic solutions containing Zn2 + ions , the hydroxide Zn ( OH )

 <unk> compounds are those that contain zinc – carbon covalent bonds . <unk> ( ( C 
 <unk> ) 
 <unk> ) is a reagent in synthetic chemistry . It was first reported in 1848 from the reaction of zinc and ethyl iodide , and was the first compound known to contain a metal – carbon sigma bond . 
 Tests for Zinc 
 <unk> paper ( <unk> 's test for Zn ) can be used as a chemical indicator for zinc . 4g of <unk> ( CN ) 6 and 1g of <unk> is dissolved on <unk> of water . Paper is dipped in the solution and dried at 100 * C. One drop of the sample is dropped onto the dry paper and heated . A green disc indicates the presence of zinc .

 = = = Ancient use = = = 
 Various isolated examples of the use of impure zinc in ancient times have been discovered . Zinc ores were used to make the zinc – copper alloy brass thousands of years prior to the discovery of zinc as a separate element . Judean brass from the 14th to 10th centuries BC contains 23 % zinc . 
 Knowledge of how to produce brass spread to Ancient Greece by the 7th century BC , but few varieties were made . Ornaments made of alloys containing 80 – 90 % zinc , with lead , iron , antimony , and other metals making up the remainder , have been found that are 2 @,@ 500 years old . A possibly prehistoric statuette containing 87 @.@ 5 % zinc was found in a Dacian archaeological site . 
 The oldest known pills were made of the zinc carbonates <unk> and <unk> . The pills were used for sore eyes and were found aboard the Roman ship <unk> del <unk> , wrecked in 140 BC . 
 The manufacture of brass was known to the Romans by about 30 BC . They made brass by heating powdered calamine ( zinc silicate or carbonate ) , charcoal and copper together in a crucible . The resulting calamine brass was then either cast or hammered into shape for use in weaponry . Some coins struck by Romans in the Christian era are made of what is probably calamine brass . 
 Strabo writing in the 1st century BC ( but quoting a now lost work of the 4th century BC historian Theopompus ) mentions " drops of false silver " which when mixed with copper make brass . This may refer to small quantities of zinc that is a by @-@ product of smelting sulfide ores . Zinc in such remnants in smelting ovens was usually discarded as it was thought to be worthless . 
 The Berne zinc tablet is a votive plaque dating to Roman Gaul made of an alloy that is mostly zinc . 
 The Charaka Samhita , thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD , mentions a metal which , when oxidized , produces <unk> , thought to be zinc oxide . Zinc mines at Zawar , near Udaipur in India , have been active since the Mauryan period . The smelting of metallic zinc here , however , appears to have begun around the 12th century AD . One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries . Another estimate gives a total production of 60 @,@ 000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period . The <unk> <unk> , written in approximately the 13th century AD , mentions two types of zinc @-@ containing ores : one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes . 
 = = = Early studies and naming = = = 
 Zinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of <unk> or <unk> in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king <unk> and written about the year 1374 . Smelting and extraction of impure zinc by reducing calamine with wool and other organic substances was accomplished in the 13th century in India . The Chinese did not learn of the technique until the 17th century . 
 Alchemists burned zinc metal in air and collected the resulting zinc oxide on a condenser . Some alchemists called this zinc oxide <unk> <unk> , Latin for " philosopher 's wool " , because it collected in wooly tufts , whereas others thought it looked like white snow and named it nix album . 
 The name of the metal was probably first documented by Paracelsus , a Swiss @-@ born German alchemist , who referred to the metal as " <unk> " or " <unk> " in his book Liber <unk> II , in the 16th century . The word is probably derived from the German <unk> , and supposedly meant " tooth @-@ like , pointed or jagged " ( metallic zinc crystals have a needle @-@ like appearance ) . Zink could also imply " tin @-@ like " because of its relation to German <unk> meaning tin . Yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the Persian word <unk> seng meaning stone . The metal was also called Indian tin , <unk> , calamine , and <unk> . 
 German metallurgist Andreas Libavius received a quantity of what he called " <unk> " of Malabar from a cargo ship captured from the Portuguese in 1596 . Libavius described the properties of the sample , which may have been zinc . Zinc was regularly imported to Europe from the Orient in the 17th and early 18th centuries , but was at times very expensive . 
 = = = Isolation = = = 
 Metallic zinc was isolated in India by 1300 AD , much earlier than in the West . Before it was isolated in Europe , it was imported from India in about 1600 CE . <unk> 's Universal Dictionary , a contemporary source giving technological information in Europe , did not mention zinc before 1751 but the element was studied before then . 
 Flemish metallurgist and alchemist P. M. de <unk> reported that he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668 . By the start of the 18th century , Étienne François Geoffroy described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted . In Britain , John Lane is said to have carried out experiments to smelt zinc , probably at <unk> , prior to his bankruptcy in 1726 . 
 In 1738 in Great Britain , William Champion patented a process to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical retort style smelter . His technique resembled that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan , but no evidence suggests he visited the Orient . Champion 's process was used through 1851 . 
 German chemist Andreas Marggraf normally gets credit for discovering pure metallic zinc , even though Swedish chemist Anton von <unk> had distilled zinc from calamine four years previously . In his 1746 experiment , Marggraf heated a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal . This procedure became commercially practical by 1752 . 
 = = = Later work = = = 
 William Champion 's brother , John , patented a process in 1758 for <unk> zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process . Prior to this , only calamine could be used to produce zinc . In 1798 , Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter . Jean @-@ Jacques Daniel <unk> built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium that processed even more zinc . Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog 's leg to twitch . He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect " animal electricity " . The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani , and his discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries , galvanization , and cathodic protection . 
 Galvani 's friend , Alessandro Volta , continued researching the effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800 . The basic unit of Volta 's pile was a simplified galvanic cell , made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an electrolyte and connected by a conductor externally . The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell , which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode . 
 The non @-@ magnetic character of zinc and its lack of color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition . This changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase , an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood , was shown to have zinc in its active site . The digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc @-@ containing enzyme in 1955 . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Mining and processing = = = 
 Zinc is the fourth most common metal in use , trailing only iron , aluminium , and copper with an annual production of about 13 million tonnes . The world 's largest zinc producer is <unk> , a merger of the Australian OZ Minerals and the Belgian <unk> . About 70 % of the world 's zinc originates from mining , while the remaining 30 % comes from recycling secondary zinc . Commercially pure zinc is known as Special High Grade , often abbreviated SHG , and is 99 @.@ 995 % pure . 
 Worldwide , 95 % of new zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits , in which sphalerite ( ZnS ) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper , lead and iron . Zinc mines are scattered throughout the world , with the main areas being China , Australia , and Peru . China produced 38 % of the global zinc output in 2014 . 
 Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy . The ore is finely ground , then put through froth flotation to separate minerals from gangue ( on the property of hydrophobicity ) , to get a zinc sulfide ore concentrate consisting of about 50 % zinc , 32 % sulfur , 13 % iron , and 5 % SiO 
 2 . 
 Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate to zinc oxide : 
 2 ZnS + 3 O 
 2 → 2 ZnO + 2 SO 
 2 
 The sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric acid , which is necessary for the leaching process . If deposits of zinc carbonate , zinc silicate , or zinc spinel ( like the Skorpion Deposit in Namibia ) are used for zinc production , the roasting can be omitted . 
 For further processing two basic methods are used : <unk> or electrowinning . <unk> reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at 950 ° C ( 1 @,@ 740 ° F ) into the metal , which is distilled as zinc vapor to separate it from other metals , which are not volatile at those temperatures . The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser . The equations below describe this process : 
 2 ZnO + C → 2 Zn + CO 
 2 
 ZnO + CO → Zn + CO 
 2 
 In electrowinning , zinc is leached from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid : 
 ZnO + H 
 2SO 
 4 → ZnSO 
 4 + H 
 2O 
 Finally , the zinc is reduced by electrolysis . 
 2 ZnSO 
 4 + 2 H 
 2O → 2 Zn + 2 H 
 2SO 
 4 + O 
 2 
 The sulfuric acid is regenerated and recycled to the leaching step . 
 When galvanised feedstock is fed to an electric arc furnace , the zinc is recovered from the dust by a number of processes , predominately the Waelz process ( 90 % as of 2014 ) . 
 = = = Environmental impact = = = 
 Refinement of sulfidic zinc ores produces large volumes of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor . Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of heavy metals . About 1 @.@ 1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La <unk> and <unk> between 1806 and 1882 . The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium , and the sediments of the <unk> River contain non @-@ trivial amounts of heavy metals . About two thousand years ago , emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year . After increasing 10 @-@ fold from 1850 , zinc emissions peaked at 3 @.@ 4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2 @.@ 7 million tonnes in the 1990s , although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline . Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1 . 
 Zinc in rivers flowing through industrial and mining areas can be as high as 20 ppm . Effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this ; treatment along the Rhine , for example , has decreased zinc levels to 50 ppb . Concentrations of zinc as low as 2 ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood . 
 Soils contaminated with zinc from mining , refining , or fertilizing with zinc @-@ bearing sludge can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil . Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals , such as iron and manganese . Zinc levels of 2000 ppm to 180 @,@ 000 ppm ( 18 % ) have been recorded in some soil samples .

 = = = Anti @-@ corrosion and batteries = = = 
 Zinc is most commonly used as an anti @-@ corrosion agent , and galvanization ( coating of iron or steel ) is the most familiar form . In 2009 in the United States , 55 % or 893 thousand tonnes of the zinc metal was used for galvanization . 
 Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away . A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate ( Zn 
 5 ( OH ) 
 6 ( CO 
 3 ) 
 2 ) forms as the zinc corrodes . This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away . The zinc is applied <unk> or as molten zinc by hot @-@ dip galvanizing or spraying . <unk> is used on chain @-@ link fencing , guard rails , suspension bridges , lightposts , metal roofs , heat exchangers , and car bodies . 
 The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection ( CP ) . For example , cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe . Zinc acts as the anode ( negative terminus ) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline . Zinc is also used to <unk> protect metals that are exposed to sea water . A zinc disc attached to a ship 's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact . Similarly , a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection . 
 With a standard electrode potential ( SEP ) of − 0 @.@ 76 volts , zinc is used as an anode material for batteries . ( More reactive lithium ( SEP − 3 @.@ 04 V ) is used for anodes in lithium batteries ) . Powdered zinc is used in this way in alkaline batteries and the case ( which also serves as the anode ) of zinc – carbon batteries is formed from sheet zinc . Zinc is used as the anode or fuel of the zinc @-@ air battery / fuel cell . The zinc @-@ cerium redox flow battery also relies on a zinc @-@ based negative half @-@ cell . 
 = = = Alloys = = = 
 A widely used zinc alloy is brass , in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3 % to 45 % zinc , depending upon the type of brass . Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper , and has superior corrosion resistance . These properties make it useful in communication equipment , hardware , musical instruments , and water valves . 
 Other widely used zinc alloys include nickel silver , typewriter metal , soft and aluminium solder , and commercial bronze . Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead / tin alloy in pipes . Alloys of 85 – 88 % zinc , 4 – 10 % copper , and 2 – 8 % aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings . Zinc is the primary metal in American one cent coins ( pennies ) since 1982 . The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the appearance of a copper coin . In 1994 , 33 @,@ 200 tonnes ( 36 @,@ 600 short tons ) of zinc were used to produce 13 @.@ 6 billion pennies in the United States . 
 Alloys of zinc with small amounts of copper , aluminium , and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting , especially in the automotive , electrical , and hardware industries . These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak . An example of this is zinc aluminium . The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes . The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly . Another alloy , marketed under the brand name <unk> , contains 78 % zinc and 22 % aluminium , and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic . This <unk> of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement . 
 Similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold @-@ rolled into sheets . An alloy of 96 % zinc and 4 % aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive . For building facades , roofing , and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing , roll forming , or bending , zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used . <unk> zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes . 
 As a dense , inexpensive , easily worked material , zinc is used as a lead replacement . In the wake of lead concerns , zinc appears in weights for various applications ranging from fishing to tire balances and flywheels . 
 Cadmium zinc telluride ( <unk> ) is a <unk> alloy that can be divided into an array of small sensing devices . These devices are similar to an integrated circuit and can detect the energy of incoming gamma ray photons . When behind an absorbing mask , the <unk> sensor array can determine the direction of the rays . 
 = = = Other industrial uses = = = 
 Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was consumed in zinc compounds ; a variety of which are used industrially . Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber to disburse heat . Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation ( UV ) . The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products . The zinc zinc @-@ oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production . 
 Zinc chloride is often added to lumber as a fire retardant and sometimes as a wood preservative . It is used in the manufacture of other chemicals . Zinc methyl ( Zn ( CH3 ) 
 2 ) is used in a number of organic syntheses . Zinc sulfide ( ZnS ) is used in luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks , X @-@ ray and television screens , and luminous paints . Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the mid @-@ infrared part of the spectrum . Zinc sulfate is a chemical in dyes and pigments . Zinc pyrithione is used in <unk> paints . 
 Zinc powder is sometimes used as a propellant in model rockets . When a compressed mixture of 70 % zinc and 30 % sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction . This produces zinc sulfide , together with large amounts of hot gas , heat , and light . 
 Zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars . 
 64Zn , the most abundant isotope of zinc , is very susceptible to neutron activation , being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65Zn , which has a half @-@ life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation . Because of this , zinc oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti @-@ corrosion agent is depleted of 64Zn before use , this is called depleted zinc oxide . For the same reason , zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons ( cobalt is another , better @-@ known salting material ) . A jacket of isotopically enriched 64Zn would be irradiated by the intense high @-@ energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon , forming a large amount of 65Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon 's fallout . Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built , tested , or used . 
 65Zn is used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out , or the path and the role of zinc in organisms . 
 Zinc <unk> complexes are used as agricultural fungicides ; these include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Zinc <unk> is used as wood preservative . Zinc in the form of <unk> , is used as an anti @-@ wear additive for metal parts in engine oil . 
 = = = Dietary supplement = = = 
 In most single @-@ tablet , over @-@ the @-@ counter , daily vitamin and mineral supplements , zinc is included in such forms as zinc oxide , zinc acetate , or zinc gluconate . Zinc is believed to be an antioxidant that may protect against accelerated aging of the skin and muscles of the body ; studies differ as to its effectiveness . Zinc also helps speed up the healing process after an injury . It is also suspected of being beneficial to the human immune system , and deficiency may be deleterious to virtually all parts of the system . 
 Zinc deficiency has been associated with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , and zinc supplements may be an effective treatment . 
 Zinc serves as a simple , inexpensive , and critical tool for treating <unk> episodes among children in the developing world . Zinc becomes depleted in the body during diarrhea , but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc with a 10- to 14 @-@ day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of <unk> episodes and may also prevent future episodes for as long as three months . 
 The Age @-@ Related Eye Disease Study determined that zinc can be part of an effective treatment for age @-@ related macular degeneration . Zinc supplement is an effective treatment for acrodermatitis <unk> , a genetic disorder affecting zinc absorption that was previously fatal to affected infants . 
 Gastroenteritis is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc , possibly by direct antimicrobial action of the ions in the gastrointestinal tract , or by the absorption of the zinc and re @-@ release from immune cells ( all granulocytes secrete zinc ) , or both . 
 In 2011 , researchers at John Jay College of Criminal Justice reported that dietary zinc supplements can mask the presence of drugs in urine . Similar claims appear in web forums .

 <unk> chemistry is the science of <unk> that contain carbon @-@ zinc bonds , describing the physical properties , synthesis , and chemical <unk> organozinc compounds are important . Among important applications are 
 The Frankland @-@ <unk> Reaction in which an oxalate ester ( <unk> ) reacts with an alkyl halide R 'X , zinc and hydrochloric acid to form the α @-@ <unk> esters RR <unk> 
 The <unk> reaction in which α @-@ halo @-@ esters and aldehydes are converted to β @-@ hydroxy @-@ esters

 The Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to form carbonyl compounds 
 The Barbier reaction ( 1899 ) , which is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is the better of the two . In presence of water , formation of the <unk> halide will fail , whereas the Barbier reaction can take place in water . 
 On the downside , <unk> are much less nucleophilic than <unk> , and they are expensive and difficult to handle . Commercially available <unk> compounds are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . In one study , the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors 
 The Negishi coupling is also an important reaction for the formation of new carbon @-@ carbon bonds between unsaturated carbon atoms in alkenes , <unk> and alkynes . The catalysts are nickel and palladium . A key step in the catalytic cycle is a transmetalation in which a zinc halide exchanges its organic substituent for another halogen with the palladium ( nickel ) metal center . 
 The Fukuyama coupling is another coupling reaction , but it uses a thioester as reactant and produces a ketone . 
 Zinc has found many applications as catalyst in organic synthesis including asymmetric synthesis , being cheap and easily available alternative to precious metal complexes . The results ( yield and ee ) obtained with chiral zinc catalysts are comparable to those achieved with palladium , ruthenium , iridium and others , and zinc becomes metal catalyst of choice . 
 = = Biological role = = 
 Zinc is an essential trace element for humans and other animals , for plants and for microorganisms . Zinc is found in nearly 100 specific enzymes ( other sources say 300 ) , serves as structural ions in transcription factors and is stored and transferred in <unk> . It is " typically the second most abundant transition metal in organisms " after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes . 
 In proteins , Zinc ions are often coordinated to the amino acid side chains of aspartic acid , glutamic acid , cysteine and histidine . The theoretical and computational description of this zinc binding in proteins ( as well as that of other transition metals ) is difficult . 
 Between 2 and 4 grams of zinc are distributed throughout the human body . Most zinc is in the brain , muscle , bones , kidney , and liver , with the highest concentrations in the prostate and parts of the eye . Semen is particularly rich in zinc , a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth . 
 In humans , zinc plays " ubiquitous biological roles " . It interacts with " a wide range of organic ligands " , and has roles in the metabolism of RNA and DNA , signal transduction , and gene expression . It also regulates apoptosis . A 2006 study estimated that about 10 % of human proteins ( 2800 ) potentially bind zinc , in addition to hundreds more that transport and traffic zinc ; a similar in silico study in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana found <unk> zinc @-@ related proteins . 
 In the brain , zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons and can " modulate brain excitability " . It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning . However , it has been called " the brain 's dark horse " because it also can be a neurotoxin , suggesting zinc homeostasis plays a critical role in normal functioning of the brain and central nervous system . 
 = = = Enzymes = = = 
 Zinc is an efficient Lewis acid , making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions . The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry , which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions . Two examples of zinc @-@ containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase , which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide ( CO 
 2 ) regulation and digestion of proteins , respectively . 
 In vertebrate blood , carbonic anhydrase converts CO 
 2 into bicarbonate and the same enzyme transforms the bicarbonate back into CO 
 2 for exhalation through the lungs . Without this enzyme , this conversion would occur about one million times slower at the normal blood pH of 7 or would require a pH of 10 or more . The non @-@ related β @-@ carbonic anhydrase is required in plants for leaf formation , the synthesis of indole acetic acid ( auxin ) and alcoholic fermentation . 
 <unk> cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins . A coordinate covalent bond is formed between the terminal peptide and a C = O group attached to zinc , which gives the carbon a positive charge . This helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc , which attracts the non @-@ polar part of the protein being digested . 
 = = = Other proteins = = = 
 Zinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers , twists and clusters . Zinc fingers form parts of some transcription factors , which are proteins that recognize DNA base sequences during the replication and transcription of DNA . Each of the nine or ten Zn2 + ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger 's structure by <unk> binding to four amino acids in the transcription factor . The transcription factor wraps around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately bind to the DNA sequence . 
 In blood plasma , zinc is bound to and transported by albumin ( 60 % , low @-@ affinity ) and transferrin ( 10 % ) . Because transferrin also transports iron , excessive iron reduces zinc absorption , and vice versa . A similar antagonism exists with copper . The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake . Cells in the salivary gland , prostate , immune system , and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells . 
 Zinc may be held in metallothionein reserves within microorganisms or in the intestines or liver of animals . <unk> in intestinal cells is capable of adjusting absorption of zinc by 15 – 40 % . However , inadequate or excessive zinc intake can be harmful ; excess zinc particularly impairs copper absorption because metallothionein absorbs both metals . 
 = = = Dietary reference intake = = = 
 The Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. Institute of Medicine updated Estimated Average Requirements ( EARs ) and Recommended Dietary Allowances ( RDAs ) for zinc in 2001 . The current EARs for zinc for women and men ages 14 and up are 6 @.@ 8 mg / day and 9 @.@ 4 mg / day , respectively . The RDAs are 8 and 11 mg / day . RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements . RDA for pregnancy equals 11 mg / day . RDA for lactation equals 12 mg / day . For infants up to 12 months the RDA is 3 mg / day and for children ages 1 – 13 years the RDA increases with age from 3 to 8 mg / day . As for safety , the Food and Nutrition Board also sets Tolerable Upper Intake Levels ( known as ULs ) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient . In the case of zinc the UL is set at 40 mg / day . Collectively the EARs , RDAs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes . The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25 mg / day . 
 For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value ( % DV ) . For zinc labeling purposes 100 % of the Daily Value was 15 mg , but as of May 2016 it has been revised to 11 mg . A table of the pre @-@ change adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake . Food and supplement companies have until July 28 , 2018 to comply with the change . 
 = = = Dietary intake = = = 
 Animal @-@ sourced foods ( meat , fish , shellfish , fowl , eggs , dairy ) provide zinc . The concentration of zinc in plants varies with the level in the soil . With adequate zinc in the soil , the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat ( germ and bran ) and various seeds ( sesame , poppy , alfalfa , celery , mustard ) . Zinc is also found in beans , nuts , almonds , whole grains , pumpkin seeds , sunflower seeds and blackcurrant . 
 Other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements in various forms . A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide , one of the most common supplements in the United States , and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body . This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts . However , harmful excessive supplementation is a problem among the relatively affluent , and should probably not exceed 20 mg / day in healthy people . 
 For fortification , however , a 2003 review recommended cereals ( containing zinc oxide ) as a cheap , stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms . A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc , including oxide and sulfate , did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as <unk> to maize tortillas . A 1987 study found that zinc <unk> was better absorbed than zinc gluconate or zinc citrate . However , a study published in 2008 determined that zinc <unk> is the most readily absorbed of the four available dietary supplement compounds . 
 = = = Deficiency = = = 
 Zinc deficiency is usually due to insufficient dietary intake , but can be associated with malabsorption , acrodermatitis <unk> , chronic liver disease , chronic renal disease , sickle cell disease , diabetes , malignancy , and other chronic illnesses . Groups at risk for zinc deficiency include the elderly , children in developing countries , and those with renal dysfunction . 
 In the United States , a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19 , average consumption was 9 @.@ 7 and 14 @.@ 2 mg / day , respectively . For women , 17 % consumed less than the EAR , for men 11 % . The percentages below EAR increased with age . 
 Symptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse . Clinical outcomes include depressed growth , diarrhea , impotence and delayed sexual maturation , alopecia , eye and skin lesions , impaired appetite , altered cognition , impaired host defense properties , defects in carbohydrate utilization , and reproductive <unk> . Mild zinc deficiency depresses immunity , although excessive zinc does also . Animals with a zinc deficiency require twice as much food to attain the same weight gain as animals with sufficient zinc . 
 Despite some concerns , western vegetarians and vegans do not suffer any more from overt zinc deficiency than meat @-@ eaters . Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans , sea vegetables , fortified cereals , soy foods , nuts , peas , and seeds . However , <unk> in many whole @-@ grains and fibers may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects . The zinc chelator phytate , found in seeds and cereal bran , can contribute to zinc malabsorption . Some evidence suggests that more than the US RDA ( 15 mg ) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in <unk> , such as some vegetarians . These considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers , and the most widely used indicator , plasma zinc , has poor sensitivity and specificity . Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge . 
 Nearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc . In children , it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800 @,@ 000 children worldwide per year . The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea . Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality , especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth . However , zinc supplements should not be administered alone , because many in the developing world have several deficiencies , and zinc interacts with other micronutrients .

 Zinc deficiency appears to be the most common micronutrient deficiency in crop plants ; it is particularly common in high @-@ pH soils . Zinc @-@ deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India , a third of China , and most of Western Australia . Substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas . Plants that grow in soils that are zinc @-@ deficient are more susceptible to disease . Zinc is added to the soil primarily through the weathering of rocks , but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion , mine waste , phosphate fertilizers , pesticide ( zinc phosphide ) , limestone , manure , sewage sludge , and particles from galvanized surfaces . Excess zinc is toxic to plants , although zinc toxicity is far less widespread . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 = = = Toxicity = = = 
 Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health , excess zinc can be harmful . Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption . The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants , invertebrates , and even vertebrate fish . The Free Ion Activity Model is well @-@ established in the literature , and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms . A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93 % of all Daphnia in water . 
 The free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive . Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid , in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride . Swallowing a post @-@ 1982 American one cent piece ( 97 @.@ 5 % zinc ) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach . 
 Evidence shows that people taking 100 – 300 mg of zinc daily may suffer induced copper deficiency . A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo . Levels of 100 – 300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol . Zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interferes with the plant absorption of other essential metals , such as iron and manganese . A condition called the zinc shakes or " zinc chills " can be induced by inhalation of zinc fumes while brazing or welding galvanized materials . Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram . Disability and even deaths from excessive use of these products have been claimed . 
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) states that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose , causing anosmia . Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections . On June 16 , 2009 , the FDA ordered removal of zinc @-@ based intranasal cold products from store shelves . The FDA said the loss of smell can be life @-@ threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke , and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it . Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response <unk> that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP @-@ dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes . 
 = = = Poisoning = = = 
 In 1982 , the US Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but containing primarily zinc . The new zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis , which can be fatal . One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies ( over 1 kg of zinc ) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis . Another patient who ingested 12 grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia ( gross lack of coordination of muscle movements ) . Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins . 
 Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs , requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects . The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity , commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage ; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms . Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal . The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc . 
 = Engleromyces sinensis = 
 Engleromyces sinensis is a species of fungus in the family Xylariaceae . It was described as new to science in 2010 , based on specimens collected in 1958 and incorrectly identified as Engleromyces goetzii . The fungus is known only from China , where it grows on bamboo culms . It forms fruit bodies in the shape of two roughly circular buff @-@ colored lobes measuring up to 50 cm ( 20 in ) in diameter that envelop the bamboo . E. sinensis has been used as a folk remedy against cancer and infection in Tibet , Yunnan , and Sichuan Provinces . Several bioactive metabolites have been isolated and identified from the fungus . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 Engleromyces sinensis was described as a new species in 2010 . The authors were studying members of the family Xylariaceae that were housed in the Mycological Herbarium of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing , and discovered that five specimens labeled as E. goetzii , collected from Jade Dragon Snow Mountain ( Yunnan Province ) in 1958 , did not match descriptions of the species published by Paul Christoph Hennings ( 1900 ) , Curtis Gates Lloyd ( 1917 ) , R.W.G. Dennis ( 1961 ) or Jack Rogers ( 1981 ) . These species descriptions , which were based on collections made in Africa , convinced the authors that the Chinese collections were sufficiently different from E. goetzii to warrant describing a new species . Prior to this discovery , Engleromyces was a monotypic genus . The specific epithet sinensis means " Chinese " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies of Engleromyces sinensis form two roughly spherical lobes that partially envelop the bamboo substrate . The official description gives dimensions of 4 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 9 cm ( 1 @.@ 7 – 1 @.@ 9 in ) by 4 – 5 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 2 in ) and 1 @.@ 6 – 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) in height , although specimens in markets measuring 10 to 50 cm ( 4 to 20 in ) in diameter have been noted . When young , the surface is buff @-@ colored with a pinkish hue and slightly dimpled surface ; the color changes to grayish @-@ brown and the surface becomes smoother as the fungus matures . The internal flesh is buff colored , with a firm texture that later becomes woody . The ostioles ( minute openings through which spores are released ) , which are scattered about the surface of the fruit bodies , are somewhat nipple @-@ like when young but later become sharper ( punctate ) . Situated under a crust with a thickness of about 1 mm , the perithecia are arranged in rows . They are spherical to flask shaped , with eight @-@ spored asci . The asci are funnel or T @-@ shaped , somewhat like a golf tee , and measure about 4 by 4 µm . They have an apical apparatus ( a region at the ascus tip that forms the spore @-@ shooting mechanism ) that stains blue in Melzer 's reagent . The smooth , black ascospores are lined up in a single row , and feature drop @-@ like appendages that are visible when still in the ascus . Measuring 15 – 19 by 11 @.@ 5 – 12 @.@ 5 µm , they are broadly inequilateral with one or both ends shortened , and lack a germ pore . 
 In contrast to E. goetzii ( the type species of Engleromyces ) , E. sinensis has smaller spores , and an apical apparatus that is T @-@ shaped rather than cuboid . E. goetzii fruit bodies can grow quite large – " to the size of a football " – and weigh up to 4 kilograms ( 8 @.@ 8 lb ) . They only grow on the African alpine bamboo ( <unk> alpina ) . The Siamese jelly ball fungus , <unk> siamensis , produces fruit bodies that are superficially similar to those of E. sinensis . However , the former are smaller , have a gelatinous texture , and are only found in Thailand , where they grow on bamboo culms and branches at elevations ranging from 390 – 840 m ( 1 @,@ 280 – 2 @,@ 760 ft ) .

 Engleromyces sinensis is known only from China , including its type location in Yunnan , China , in Yulong County . The fungus has also been collected from <unk> County ( Tibet ) , where it was found growing in a coniferous forest . It has been collected at elevations between 2 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 500 m ( 6 @,@ 600 to 11 @,@ 500 ft ) . Fruit bodies grow on and partially envelop bamboo culms . Specifically , E. sinensis has been recorded from a species of bamboo variously known as <unk> <unk> or F. <unk> , depending on the authority . Engleromyces collections made in Nepal , initially identified as E. goetzii , are likely to be E. sinensis .

 = Arthur James Dingle = 
 Arthur " Mud " James Dingle ( 16 October 1891 – 22 August 1915 ) was a rugby union centre and wing , who won three caps for England , and played for County Durham , Hartlepool Rovers and Oxford University . 
 He was born and raised in County Durham , attending Durham School , where he was head boy and excelled at many sports , especially rugby . He went on to study at Keble College , Oxford , playing rugby for the college and captaining the team in his final year . He played in the 1911 Varsity Match , in which he scored a try . He was first selected for England in February 1913 , against Ireland , although he had not been picked for Oxford that year . After graduating , he returned to Durham School as a master . He played for Hartlepool Rovers , scoring 55 tries in the 1913 – 14 season , as well as four hat @-@ tricks for County Durham , helping them reach the County Championship finals . He was picked for England against Scotland and France in the last international matches before the outbreak of the First World War . 
 Dingle , who had been a member of the Oxford Officers Training Corps , was gazetted second lieutenant in the 6th Battalion , East Yorkshire Regiment , which took part in the Suvla Bay Landing of the Gallipoli Campaign on 6 August 1915 . His battalion took Scimitar Hill on 9 August , with great loss of life , only to be forced to make a tactical withdrawal . On 21 August , the Battle of Scimitar Hill ensued , a disaster for Britain and her allies : Dingle was killed the following day , defending a trench that had earlier been captured . He is commemorated on the Helles Memorial to the missing dead .

 Arthur Dingle was born on 16 October 1891 at Hetton @-@ le @-@ Hole , County Durham , the eldest son of Beatrice ( née Robson ) and Reverend Arthur <unk> Dingle , Rector of <unk> . He had a brother , Hugh John Dingle . Arthur attended Bow School in Durham and then Durham School , where he was head of school , and displayed an aptitude for cricket , gymnastics , rowing and rugby . He then went up to Keble College , Oxford in 1910 , where he read theology in anticipation of being ordained . 
 = = Rugby career = = 
 At Oxford , Dingle played for his college , Keble , and captained the team in his final year . He also played on Saturdays for Rosslyn Park , joining a school friend , Nowell <unk> at the club . He was soon selected to play for Oxford , at centre , winning his Blue in the 1911 Varsity Match . In front of 10 @,@ 000 spectators at Queen 's Club on 12 December , Cambridge were the clear favourites to win : Oxford had lost 5 of the previous 13 games . Under the leadership of Ronnie Poulton , however , Oxford won a decisive victory , leading 11 – 0 already at half time . In the second half , a further two tries — one from Dingle , which Poulton described as " magnificent " — sealed the victory , 19 – 0 . 
 The following season , on 6 November 1912 , Oxford hosted the South African team touring the United Kingdom and France . Dingle played at centre . It was a close contest , with South Africa coming through to win 6 – 0 . After the Springboks ' convincing victory over Cambridge a little later , Oxford were favourites to win the Varsity Match and to add to their winning series . Dingle was unable to play due to injury , missing a game that went against the odds . 
 Dingle got his first call up to the England national team to face Ireland on 8 February 1913 , playing centre alongside Poulton , although he had not been selected to play for Oxford . The Times described his debut performance as ' strong in defence , but ... not altogether a success ' , while The Aberdeen Journal described him as ' fair ' , amongst a backline that was ' lacking in finishing power ' , with Poulton , ' poor ' . England gained an ' easy ' victory 15 – 4 but failed to turn their opportunities into points . Dingle was not picked for the next match , against Scotland on 15 March .

 After he graduated , Dingle played for Richmond RFC and Surrey then , returning to Durham to become a master at his old school , he played for Hartlepool Rovers , and captained the team . At county level , he played for Durham , and had a significant part in helping the team reach the finals of the County Championship Tournament , scoring in each of the seven matches . In total , he scored 55 tries in the season , 39 for Hartlepool and a further 16 for Durham . 
 Early in the season , England played The South at Twickenham , winning 21 – 12 , with outstanding performances from Dingle , as well as Johnson and Poulton . Dingle then played in the third and final trial against the Rest of England , which England won 42 – 27 . His selection for the Five Nations came up for the match against Scotland , replacing Roberts on the left wing , who had had a poor game in the prior encounter against Ireland . Before the Scotland match on 21 March , Bill Maclagan described the English team as one of the best to visit Scotland . Having already defeated Wales and Ireland , England beat Scotland 15 – 16 in a close @-@ fought game . Scotland , with the wind behind them , opened the scoring in the first half with a try but England equalised just before half time . After the break , England got up a lead of 6 – 16 and victory seemed certain . Scotland responded and closed the gap to one point . After Cherry Pillman 's leg was broken in a tackle , England were playing with fourteen men , but they managed to hold on , thereby winning both the Triple Crown and the Calcutta Cup , as well as the Five Nations Championship . Dingle , in the opening minutes , missed a try @-@ scoring opportunity when he knocked @-@ on a pass from Poulton . Yet he had a positive impact in other parts of the game . It was England 's last international test on British soil before the First World War : 11 of the 30 players went on to be killed in it , including the Scotsman William Middleton Wallace , who died the same day as Dingle . 
 Dingle was kept on for the final match of the tournament against France . England overwhelmed France in a 13 – 39 defeat , in which the French crowd 's behaviour towards the visiting team was ' disorderly ' . The Times was once again critical of Dingle 's performance : ' AJ Dingle was the weakest of the four [ <unk> ] . He failed to take the passes and was very slow getting into his <unk> 
 With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 , competitive rugby matches were suspended . Despite this , Edgar Mobbs , the captain of the Barbarians invitation side , organised a match against the Royal Army Medical Corps ( RAMC ) on 10 April 1915 . The Barbarians team on that day was made up of military personnel , including Dingle , who contributed a try towards a 10 – 3 victory .

 Since Dingle was a school master , he was exempt from military service , but having been a member of the Oxford University Officers Training Corps ( OTC ) , and having set up the OTC at Durham School , he sought permission to enlist from the headmaster , Canon Budworth . He was commissioned on 29 August 1914 temporary second lieutenant into the 6th Battalion , East Yorkshire Regiment . He was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 8 December . 
 Dingle 's regiment was sent to Gallipoli and took part in the Suvla Bay landings on 6 August 1915 . His battalion soon took the small hill at Lala Baba , with the loss of many lives . Three days later , with Dingle made temporary captain , his battalion captured Scimitar Hill , once again with great loss of life , but then made a tactical withdrawal . On 21 August , with Dingle as acting commanding officer of the 150 men of B Company , the battalion was involved in the Battle of Scimitar Hill , a major assault to recapture the hill , which ended in disaster . Dingle was shot through the temple and killed at dawn on 22 August 1915 , while defending a captured trench " against overwhelming odds " . It was not possible to recover his body . Of his England team @-@ mates who played Scotland in the final Calcutta Cup match in 1914 before the start of the war , three had already died : <unk> Watson , Francis Oakley and Poulton . 
 The Ballad of Suvla Bay by John Still , has these lines about Dingle : 
 He is commemorated on panels 51 to 54 of the Helles Memorial to the missing . Other rugby internationals commemorated on the monument include the two Scotsmen William Campbell Church and Eric Templeton Young , and the Englishman William <unk> . There are also memorials to him at Durham School , St Margaret 's Church in Durham , Keble College , Richmond , Rosslyn Park , Hartlepool Rovers and Oxford rugby club . There is also a tournament played amongst some of the first schools to adopt rugby , the <unk> IV , the winning team being awarded the AJ Dingle Cup . 
 = History of silk = 
 The production of silk originates in China in the Neolithic ( Yangshao culture , 4th millennium BCE ) . Silk remained confined to China until the Silk Road opened at some point during the later half of the first millennium BCE . China maintained its virtual monopoly over silk production for another thousand years . Not confined to clothing , silk was also used for a number of other applications , including writing , and the color of silk worn was an important guide of social class during the Tang Dynasty . 
 Silk cultivation spread to Japan around 300 CE , and , by 522 CE , the Byzantines managed to obtain silkworm eggs and were able to begin silkworm cultivation . The Arabs also began to manufacture silk during this same time . As a result of the spread of sericulture , Chinese silk exports became less important , although they still maintained dominance over the luxury silk market . The Crusades brought silk production to Western Europe , in particular to many Italian states , which saw an economic boom exporting silk to the rest of Europe . Changes in manufacturing techniques also began to take place during the Middle Ages , with devices such as the spinning wheel first appearing . During the 16th century France joined Italy in developing a successful silk trade , though the efforts of most other nations to develop a silk industry of their own were unsuccessful . 
 The Industrial Revolution changed much of Europe ’ s silk industry . Due to innovations in spinning cotton , cotton became much cheaper to manufacture and therefore caused more expensive silk production to become less mainstream . New weaving technologies , however , increased the efficiency of production . Among these was the Jacquard loom , developed for silk embroidery . An epidemic of several silkworm diseases caused production to fall , especially in France , where the industry never recovered . In the 20th century Japan and China regained their earlier role in silk production , and China is now once again the world ’ s largest producer of silk . The rise of new fabrics such as nylon reduced the prevalence of silk throughout the world , and silk is now once again a rare luxury good , much less important than in its heyday . 
 = = Early history = = 
 = = = The Appearance of Silk = = = 
 The earliest evidence of silk was found at the sites of Yangshao culture in Xia County , Shanxi , where a silk cocoon was found cut in half by a sharp knife , dating back to between 4000 and 3000 BCE . The species was identified as Bombyx mori , the domesticated silkworm . Fragments of primitive loom can also be seen from the sites of <unk> culture in Yuyao , Zhejiang , dated to about 4000 BCE . The earliest example of silk fabric is from 3630 BC , and was used as wrapping for the body of a child . The fabric comes from a Yangshao site in <unk> at <unk> , Henan . Scraps of silk were found in a <unk> culture site at <unk> in <unk> , Zhejiang , dating back to 2700 BCE . Other fragments have been recovered from royal tombs in the Shang Dynasty ( c . 1600 – c . 1046 BCE ) . 
 During the later epoch , the Chinese lost their secret to the Koreans , the Japanese , and , later , the Indians , as these cultures discovered how to make silk . Allusions to the fabric in the Old Testament show that it was known in western Asia in biblical times . Scholars believe that starting in the 2nd century BCE the Chinese established a commercial network aimed at exporting silk to the West . Silk was used , for example , by the Persian court and its king , Darius III , when Alexander the Great conquered the empire . Even though silk spread rapidly across Eurasia , with the possible exception of Japan its production remained exclusively Chinese for three millennia . 
 = = = Myths and legends = = = 
 The writings of Confucius and Chinese tradition recount that , in the 27th century BCE , a silk worm 's cocoon fell into the tea cup of the empress <unk> . Wishing to extract it from her drink , the 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl began to unroll the thread of the cocoon . 
 She then had the idea to weave it . Having observed the life of the silk worm on the recommendation of her husband , the Yellow Emperor , she began to instruct her entourage in the art of raising silk worms , sericulture . From this point , the girl became the goddess of silk in Chinese mythology . Silk eventually left China via the heir of a princess who was promised to a prince of Khotan . This probably occurred in the early 1st century CE . The princess , refusing to go without the fabric that she loved , would finally break the imperial ban on silk @-@ worm exportation . 
 Though silk was exported to foreign countries in great amounts , sericulture remained a secret that the Chinese carefully guarded . Consequently , other peoples invented wildly varying accounts of the source of the incredible fabric . 
 In classical antiquity , most Romans , great admirers of the cloth , were convinced that the Chinese took the fabric from tree leaves . This belief was affirmed by Seneca the Elder in his Phaedra and by Virgil in his Georgics . Notably , Pliny the Elder knew better . Speaking of the <unk> or silk moth , he wrote in his Natural History " They weave webs , like spiders , that become a luxurious clothing material for women , called silk . " 
 = = Silk usage in Ancient and Medieval China = = 
 In China , silk @-@ worm farming was originally restricted to women , and many women were employed in the silk @-@ making industry . Even though some saw the development of a luxury product as useless , silk provoked such a craze among high society that the rules in the Li Ji were used to limit its use to the members of the imperial family . For approximately a millennium , the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries . Silk was , at the time , a sign of great wealth , because of its shimmering appearance . This appearance was due to silk 's prism @-@ like shape / structure , which refracted light from every angle . After some time , silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society . Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways : musical instruments , fishing , and bow making . Peasants did not have the right to wear silk until the Qing dynasty ( 1644 – 1911 ) . 
 Paper was one of the greatest discoveries of ancient China . Beginning in the 3rd century BCE paper was made in all sizes with various materials . Silk was no exception , and silk workers had been making paper since the 2nd century BCE . Silk , bamboo , linen , wheat and rice straw were all used differently , and paper made with silk became the first type of luxury paper . Researchers have found an early example of writing done on silk paper in the tomb of a Marchioness who died around 168 , in Mawangdui , Hunan . The material was certainly more expensive , but also more practical than bamboo slips . Treatises on many subjects , including meteorology , medicine , astrology , divinity , and even maps written on silk have been discovered . 
 During the Han Dynasty , silk became progressively more valuable in its own right , and became more than simply a material . It was used to pay government officials and compensate citizens who were particularly worthy . By the same token that one would sometimes estimate the price of products according to a certain weight of gold , the length of the silk cloth became a monetary standard in China ( in addition to bronze coins ) . The wealth that silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring peoples . Beginning in the 2nd century BCE , the Xiongnu regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years . Silk was a common offering by the emperor to these tribes in exchange for peace . 
 Silk is described in a chapter on mulberry planting by Si Shengzhi of the Western Han ( 206 BC – 9 AD ) . There is a surviving calendar for silk production in an Eastern Han ( 25 – 220 AD ) document . The two other known works on silk from the Han period are lost . 
 " [ T ] he military payrolls tell us that soldiers were paid in bundles of plain silk textiles , which circulated as currency in Han times . Soldiers may well have traded their silk with the nomads who came to the gates of the Great Wall to sell horses and furs . " 
 For more than a millennium , silk remained the principal diplomatic gift of the emperor of China to his neighbors or to his vassals . The use of silk became so important that silk ( <unk> ) soon constituted one of the principal radicals of Chinese script . 
 Broadly speaking , the use of silk was regulated by a very precise code in China . For example , the Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty imposed upon bureaucrats the use of particular colors according to their different functions in society . Under the Ming , silk began to be used in a series of accessories : handkerchiefs , wallets , belts , or even an embroidered piece of fabric displaying dozens of animals , real or mythical . These fashion accessories remained associated with a particular position : there was a specific bonnet for warriors , for judges , for nobles , and others for religious use . The women of high Chinese society heeded codified practices and used silk in their garments to which they added countless motifs . A 17th @-@ century work , Jin Ping Mei , gives a description of one such motif : 
 Golden lotus having a quilted backgammon pattern , double @-@ folded , adorned with savage geese pecking at a landscape of flowers and roses ; the dress ' right figure had a floral border with buttons in the form of bees or chrysanthemums .

 Numerous archaeological discoveries show that silk had become a luxury material appreciated in foreign countries well before the opening of the Silk Road by the Chinese . For example , silk has been found in the Valley of the Kings in a tomb of a mummy dating from 1070 BCE . First the Greeks , then the Romans began to speak about the Seres ( people of silk ) , a term to designate the inhabitants of the far @-@ off kingdom , China . According to certain historians , the first Roman contact with silk was that of the legions of the governor of Syria , Crassus . At the Battle of Carrhae , near to the Euphrates , the legions were said to be so surprised by the brilliance of the banners of Parthia that they fled . 
 The silk road toward the west was opened by the Chinese in the 2nd century CE . The main road left from Xi 'an , going either to the north or south of the Taklamakan desert , one of the most arid in the world , before crossing the Pamir Mountains . The caravans that employed this method to exchange silk with other merchants were generally quite large , including from 100 to 500 people as well as camels and yaks carrying around 140 kg ( 300 lb ) of merchandise . They linked to Antioch and the coasts of the Mediterranean , about one year 's travel from Xi 'an . In the South , a second route went by Yemen , Burma , and India before rejoining the northern route . 
 Not long after the conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE regular commerce began between the Romans and Asia , marked by the Roman appetite for silk cloth coming from the Far East , which was then resold to the Romans by the Parthians . The Roman Senate tried in vain to prohibit the wearing of silk , for economic reasons as well as moral ones . The import of Chinese silk resulted in vast amounts of gold leaving Rome , to such an extent that silk clothing was perceived as a sign of decadence and immorality . 
 In the late Middle Ages , transcontinental trade over the land routes of the Silk Road declined as sea trade increased . The Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the civilizations of China , India , Ancient Egypt , Persia , Arabia , and Ancient Rome . Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China , many other goods were traded , and various technologies , religions and philosophies , as well as the bubonic plague ( the " Black Death " ) , also traveled along the Silk Routes . Some of the other goods traded included luxuries such as silk , satin , hemp and other fine fabrics , musk , other perfumes , spices , medicines , jewels , glassware , and even rhubarb , as well as slaves . China traded silk , teas , and porcelain ; while India traded spices , ivory , textiles , precious stones , and pepper ; and the Roman Empire exported gold , silver , fine glassware , wine , carpets , and jewels . Although the term the Silk Road implies a continuous journey , very few who traveled the route traversed it from end to end ; for the most part , goods were transported by a series of agents on varying routes and were traded in the bustling markets of the oasis towns . The main traders during Antiquity were the Indian and Bactrian traders , then from the 5th to the 8th century CE the Sogdian traders , then afterward the Arab and Persian traders .

 Although silk was well known in Europe and most of Asia , China was able to keep a near monopoly on silk production . The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree , condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs . Only around the year 300 CE did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese girls , who were forced to teach their captors the art of sericulture . Techniques of sericulture were subsequently introduced to Japan on a larger scale by frequent diplomatic exchanges between the 8th century and 9th centuries . 
 Starting in the 4th century BCE silk began to reach the Hellenistic world by merchants who would exchange it for gold , ivory , horses or precious stones . Up to the frontiers of the Roman Empire , silk became a monetary standard for estimating the value of different products . Hellenistic Greece appreciated the high quality of the Chinese goods and made efforts to plant mulberry trees and breed silkworms in the Mediterranean basin . Sassanid Persia controlled the trade of silk destined for Europe and Byzantium . The Greek word for " silken " was <unk> , from the name of the Seres ( <unk> ) , according to Strabo the people from whom silk was first obtained . The Greek word gave rise to Latin <unk> und ultimately Old English <unk> , Middle English silk . 
 According to a story by Procopius , it was not until 552 CE that the Byzantine emperor Justinian obtained the first silkworm eggs . He had sent two Nestorian monks to Central Asia , and they were able to smuggle silkworm eggs to him hidden in rods of bamboo . While under the monks ' care , the eggs hatched , though they did not cocoon before arrival . The Byzantine church was thus able to make fabrics for the emperor , with the intention of developing a large silk industry in the Eastern Roman Empire , using techniques learned from the Sassanids . These <unk> had a legal monopoly on the fabric , but the empire continued to import silk from other major urban centres on the Mediterranean . The magnificence of the Byzantine techniques was not a result of the manufacturing process , but instead of the meticulous attention paid to the execution and decorations . The weaving techniques they used were taken from Egypt . The first diagrams of <unk> looms appeared in the 5th century . 
 The Arabs , with their widening conquests , spread sericulture across the shores of the Mediterranean , leading to the development of sericulture in North Africa , Andalusia and Sicily . The interactions among Byzantine and Muslim silk @-@ weaving centers of all levels of quality , with imitations made in Andalusia and Lucca , among other cities , have made the identification and date of rare surviving examples difficult to pinpoint . 
 While the Chinese lost their monopoly on silk production , they were able to re @-@ establish themselves as major silk supplier ( during the Tang dynasty ) , and to industrialize their production in a large scale ( during the Song dynasty ) . China continued to export high @-@ quality fabric to Europe and the Near East along the silk road . 
 After the start of the Crusades , techniques of silk production began to spread across Western Europe . In 1147 while Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos was focusing all his efforts on the Second Crusade , the Norman king Roger II of Sicily attacked Corinth and Thebes , two important centres of Byzantine silk production . They took the crops and silk production infrastructure , and deported all the workers to Palermo , thereby causing the Norman silk industry to flourish . The sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204 brought decline to the city and its silk industry , and many artisans left the city in the early 13th century . Italy developed a large domestic silk industry after 2000 skilled weavers came from Constantinople . Many also chose to settle in Avignon to furnish the popes of Avignon . 
 The sudden boom of the silk industry in the Italian state of Lucca , starting in the 11th and 12th centuries was due to much Sicilian , Jewish , and Greek settlement , alongside many other immigrants from neighbouring cities in southern Italy . With the loss of many Italian trading posts in the Orient , the import of Chinese styles drastically declined . Gaining momentum , in order to satisfy the rich and powerful bourgeoisie 's demands for luxury fabrics , the cities of Lucca , Genoa , Venice and Florence were soon exporting silk to all of Europe . In 1472 there were 84 workshops and at least 7000 craftsmen in Florence alone . 
 = = = Reciprocal influences = = = 
 Silk was made using various breeds of lepidopterans , both wild and domestic . While wild silks were produced in many countries , there is no doubt that the Chinese were the first to begin production on such a large scale , having the most effective species for silk production , the Bombyx <unk> and its domesticated descendent B. mori . Chinese sources claim the existence of a machine to unwind silkworm cocoons in 1090 . The cocoons were placed in a large basin of hot water , the silk would leave the cauldron by tiny guiding rings , and would be wound onto a large spool , thanks to a backwards and forward motion . Little information exists about spinning techniques in use in China . The spinning wheel , in all likelihood moved by hand , was known by the beginning of the Christian era . The first accepted image of a spinning wheel appears in 1210 . There is an image of a silk spinning machine powered by a water wheel that dates to 1313 . 
 More information is known about the looms used . The Nung Sang Chi Yao , or Fundamentals of Agriculture and Sericulture , compiled around 1210 , is rich with pictures and descriptions , many pertaining to silk . It repeatedly claims the Chinese looms to be far superior to all others . It speaks of two types of loom that leave the worker 's arms free : the draw loom , which is of Eurasian origin , and the pedal loom which is attributed to East Asian origins . There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries . When examined closely , many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn . Since the Jin dynasty , the existence of silk <unk> has been well recorded , and since the 2nd century BCE , four @-@ shafted looms and other innovations allowed the creation of silk brocades .

 = = = A more abundant luxury = = = 
 The high Middle Ages saw continued use of established techniques for silk manufacture without any changes to speak of , neither in materials nor in tools used . Between the 10th and 12th centuries , small changes began to appear , though the changes of the 13th century were much larger and more radical . In a short time , new fabrics began to appear ; hemp and cotton each also had their own particular techniques of manufacture . Known since Roman times , silk remained a rare and expensive material . Byzantine <unk> in Greece and Syria ( 6th to 8th century ) , and those of the Arabs in Sicily and Spain ( 8th to 10th century ) were able to supply the luxury material in a much greater abundance . 
 = = = Improved technology = = = 
 The 13th century saw an already changing technology undergo many dramatic changes . It is possible that , as with in England at the end of the 18th century , advances in the textile industry were a driving force behind advances in technology as a whole . Silk indeed occupies a privileged place in history on account of this . 
 At the start of the 13th century , a primitive form of milling the silk threads was already in use . In 1221 Jean de <unk> 's dictionary , and in 1226 , Étienne Boileau 's Livre des métiers ( Tradesman 's Handbook ) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines . The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280 . From the start of the 14th century , many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex . 
 The reel , originally developed for the silk industry , now has multiple uses . The earliest surviving depiction of a European spinning wheel is a panel of stained glass in the Cathedral of Chartres . Bobbins and warping machines appear together in the stained glass at Chartres and in a fresco in the Cologne <unk> ( ca 1300 ) . It is possible that the toothed warping machine was created by the silk industry ; it allowed the warp to be more uniform and allowed the warp to be of a longer length . 
 Starting at the end of the 14th century , no doubt on account of the devastation caused mid @-@ century by the Black Death , there was a general shift towards less expensive techniques . Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the guilds were now commonplace ( using low quality wool , carding , etc . ) . In the silk industry , the use of water @-@ powered mills grew , and by the 15th century , the loom designed by Jean le <unk> saw nearly universal use . 
 = = = The silk industry in France = = = 
 Italian silk cloth was very expensive , as much a result of the cost of the raw material as of the production costs . The craftsmen in Italy proved unable to keep up with the exigencies of French fashion , which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials . These materials were used for clothing , and garment production began to be done locally . Nevertheless , Italian silk long remained among the most prized , mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes . 
 Following the example of the wealthy Italian city @-@ states of the era , such as Venice , Florence , and Lucca , which had become the center of the luxury @-@ textile industry , Lyon obtained a similar function in the French market . In 1466 , King Louis XI decided to develop a national silk industry in Lyon . In the face of protests by the Lyonnais , he conceded and moved the silk fabrication to Tours , but the industry in Tours stayed relatively marginal . His main objective was to reduce France 's trade deficit with Italy , which caused France to lose 400 @,@ 000 to 500 @,@ 000 golden écus a year . It was under Francis I in around 1535 that a royal charter was granted to two merchants , Étienne Turquet and Barthélemy <unk> , to develop a silk trade in Lyon . In 1540 , the king granted a monopoly on silk production to the city of Lyon . Starting in the 16th century , Lyon became the capital of the European silk trade , notably producing many reputable fashions . Gaining confidence , the silks produced in the city began to abandon the original oriental styles in favor of their own distinctive style , which emphasized landscapes . Thousand of workers , the <unk> , devoted themselves to the flourishing industry . In the middle of the 17th century , over 14 @,@ 000 looms were used in Lyon , and the silk industry fed a third of the city 's population . 
 In the 18th and 19th centuries , Provence experienced a boom in sericulture that would last until the first world war , with much of the silk shipped north to Lyon . <unk> and La Bastide @-@ des @-@ <unk> are two of the communes of <unk> that profited the most from mulberry plantations that have since disappeared . Working at home under the domestic system , silk spinning and silk treatment employed many people and increased the income of the working class . 
 = = = Spread to other countries = = = 
 England under Henry IV was also looking to develop a silk industry , but no opportunity arose until the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the 1680s , when hundreds of thousands of French Huguenots , many of whom were skilled weavers and experts in sericulture , began immigrating to England to escape religious persecution . Some areas , including Spitalfields saw many high @-@ quality silk workshops spring up , their products distinct from continental silk largely by the colors used . Nonetheless , the British climate prevented England 's domestic silk trade from becoming globally dominant . 
 Many envisioned starting a silk industry in the British colonies in America , starting in 1619 , under the reign of King James I of England . The silk industry in the colonies never became very large . Likewise , silk was introduced to numerous other countries , including Mexico , where it was brought by Cortez in 1522 . Only rarely did these new silk industries grow to any significant size . 
 = = Silk since the Industrial Revolution = = 
 = = = The start of the Industrial Revolution = = = 
 The start of the Industrial Revolution was marked by a massive boom in the textile industry , with remarkable technological innovations made , led by the cotton industry of Great Britain . In its early years , there were often disparities in technological innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture , which encouraged complementary innovations . For example , spinning progressed much more rapidly than weaving . 
 The silk industry , however , did not gain any benefit from innovations in spinning , as silk is naturally already a thread . Making silk , silver , and gold brocades is a very delicate and precise process , with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle . In the 17th century and 18th centuries progress began to be made in the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture , with many advances following one after another . <unk> and Falcon 's punched card loom appeared in 1775 , later improved on by Jacques de <unk> . Later , Joseph @-@ Marie Jacquard improved on the designs of Falcon and <unk> , introducing the revolutionary Jacquard loom , which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence . The punched cards of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern computer , in that they gave a ( limited ) form of <unk> . Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers , and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s . From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the Jacquard loom . The mechanism behind the Jacquard loom even allowed complex designs to be mass @-@ produced . 
 The Jacquard loom was immediately denounced by workers , who accused it of causing unemployment , but soon it had become vital to the industry . The loom was declared public property in 1806 , and Jacquard was rewarded with a pension and a royalty on each machine . In 1834 there were a total of <unk> Jacquard looms in Lyon alone . The <unk> revolt in 1831 foreshadowed many of the larger worker uprisings of the Industrial Revolution . The <unk> occupied the city of Lyon , and would not relinquish it until a bloody repression by the army , led by Marshal Soult . A second revolt , similar to the first , took place in 1834 . 
 = = = Decline in the European silk industry = = = 
 The first silkworm diseases began to appear in 1845 , creating an epidemic . Among them are <unk> , caused by the <unk> Nosema <unk> , <unk> , caused by a virus , <unk> , caused by eating infected mulberry leaves or white <unk> disease , caused by the fungus Beauveria bassiana . The epidemic grew to a massive scale , and after having attacked the silkworms , other viruses began to infect the mulberry trees . The chemist Jean @-@ Baptiste Dumas , French minister of agriculture , was charged with stopping the epidemic . In face of <unk> ' call for help , he asked Louis Pasteur to study the disease , starting in 1865 . For many years , Pasteur thought that <unk> was not a contagious disease . In 1870 he changed his view , and measures were enacted that caused the disease to decline . 
 Nevertheless , the increase in the price of silkworm cocoons and the reduction in importance of silk in the garments of the bourgeoisie in the 19th century caused the decline of the silk industry in Europe . The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the silk shortage in France reduced the price of importing Asian silk , particularly from China and Japan . 
 Starting from the Long Depression ( 1873 – 1896 ) , Lyonnais silk production had become totally industrialized , and hand looms were rapidly disappearing . The 19th century saw the textile industry 's progress caused by advances in chemistry . The synthesis of aniline was used to make <unk> ( aniline purple ) dye and the synthesis of quinine was used to make indigo dye . In 1884 Count Hilaire de <unk> invented artificial silk and in 1891 opened a factory dedicated to the production of artificial silk ( viscose ) , which cost much less and in part replaced natural silk . 
 = = Silk in modern times = = 
 Following the crisis in Europe , the modernization of sericulture in Japan made it the world 's foremost silk producer . By the early 20th century , rapidly industrializing Japan was producing as much as 60 percent of the world 's raw silk , most exports shipping through the port of Yokohama . Italy managed to rebound from the crisis , but France was unable . Urbanization in Europe saw many French and Italian agricultural workers leave silk growing for more lucrative factory work . Raw silk was imported from Japan to fill the void . Asian countries , formerly exporters of raw materials ( cocoons and raw silk ) , progressively began to export more and more finished garments . 
 During the Second World War , silk supplies from Japan were cut off , so western countries were forced to find substitutes . Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings , replacing silk . Even after the war , silk was not able to regain many of the markets lost , though it remained an expensive luxury product . Postwar Japan , through improvements in technology and a protectionist market policy , became the world 's foremost exporter of raw silk , a position it held until the 1970s . The continued rise in importance of synthetic fibres and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan 's silk industry , and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk . 
 With its recent economic reforms , the People 's Republic of China has become the world 's largest silk producer . In 1996 it produced 58 @,@ 000 tonnes out of a world production of 81 @,@ 000 , followed by India at 13 @,@ 000 tonnes . Japanese production is now marginal , at only 2500 tonnes . Between 1995 and 1997 Chinese silk production went down 40 % in an effort to raise prices , reminiscent of earlier shortages . 
 In December 2006 the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the International Year of Natural Fibres , so as to raise the profile of silk and other natural fibres . 
 = Trait du Nord = 
 The Trait du Nord , previously also known as Ardennais du Nord or Ardennais de type Nord , is a breed of heavy draft horse developed and bred in the area of Hainaut in western Belgium and in northeastern France . Originally considered a subtype of the Ardennes , it was recognized as an individual breed with the opening of a studbook in 1903 . Developed in the fertile Flemish grasslands , it was bred for size and pulling power for agricultural work . By 1855 , the horses bred near Hainaut were considered by some veterinarians to be superior to other Flemish draft breeds . The Trait du Nord was used extensively in mining from the late 19th century through 1920 , with lesser use continuing through the 1960s . 
 The Trait du Nord continued to be used extensively for agriculture through World War II , but after the war this usage , and the breed population , declined significantly as farming became increasingly mechanized . During the mid @-@ 20th century , the breed was in demand for the production of horse meat , and due to this was bred to be larger and heavier . In the early 1970s , the market for horse meat began to decline , and the Trait du Nord , like many European draft breeds , was in danger of extinction . It was not until the 1990s that the breed experienced a slight revival through an increased interest in recreational riding and driving . 
 The Trait du Nord is large , with stallions weighing upwards of 1 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) , and is bred for traction ability and pulling power . The breed is found in many solid colors , although bay and roan are the most common , and is known to be gentle and easy to handle . Two slightly different types of Trait du Nord are found – a larger type used for heavier pulling and a lighter type used for faster work . The breed is considered to be endangered by the French government , with fewer than 100 new foal births a year . The national breed registry in France is working with local groups in an attempt to promote this breed and bring population numbers back up . The breed currently has a high risk of inbreeding , due to the low number of breeding stallions , and is at risk of extinction . 
 = = Naming and registration = = 
 According to the French National Stud , the current official name of the breed is Trait du Nord . The name has changed several times during its history . In the mid @-@ 19th century it is mentioned as the " large horse of Hainaut " , but before 1903 it was not considered a separate breed and was often thought to be the same as the Ardennes . Beginning in 1913 , it was known as the Trait Ardennes North , and from 1945 to 1965 was known as the Northern Ardennes Draft . The name of Trait du Nord became commonly used around 1961 . 
 Until August 5 , 1903 , the Trait du Nord 's studbook was merged with that of the Ardennes , with the former being considered a subtype of the latter and called the Northern type Ardennes . The studbook was under the responsibility of the combined group " Studbook of Northern <unk> " . In 1913 , the name of Trait du Nord was used for the first time and French mares began to be registered as their own breed , although Belgian horses continued to be used for breeding , with the resulting progeny able to be registered as Trait du Nords . In 1919 , the northern type was separated from the Ardennes , although the studbooks remained tied , and the horse was given the name " Northern Ardennes " . A centralized breeding union for the Northern Ardennes was created in 1945 . 
 In France , the Syndicat d 'élevage du cheval de trait du Nord ( Union of Trait du Nord Horse Breeders ) is the national breed association recognized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries . Its mission is to promote the breed and assist in its recovery , as well as creating and executing a policy of genetic improvement through selective breeding . The association works with the French National Stud and the Center for Genetic Resources to develop breeding programs and represents the Trait du Nord on French breed committees . It also organizes and contributes to contests and events that help to promote and develop the breed . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 In the early 1930s , the breed reached the peak of its physical structure . It was then described as a born laborer , built for traction and with a conformation that allowed it to move huge weights over short distances . Although some breeds of draft horses have declined in weight in modern times , the Trait du Nord has remained relatively large . The average size in the breed is 16 @.@ 1 hands ( 65 inches , 165 cm ) for mares and 16 @.@ 2 to 16 @.@ 3 hands ( 66 to 67 inches , 168 to 170 cm ) for stallions , weighing 1 @,@ 800 to 2 @,@ 000 pounds ( 800 to 900 kg ) for mares and 1 @,@ 870 to 2 @,@ 200 pounds ( 850 to 1 @,@ 000 kg ) for stallions . Foals of 30 months who are candidates to become registered must be at least 16 hands ( 64 inches , 163 cm ) . Bay and roan are the most frequent colors seen in the breed . Chestnut ( including liver chestnut , although this color is quite rare ) is also allowed , as are black , brown and gray , although the latter is extremely rare . 
 In France , the National Stud regulates the physical standards of the Trait du Nord and eight other French breeds . The eligibility criteria have changed several times since the opening of the studbook in 1913 , and now describe the ideal Trait du Nord as large , well built , short and powerful , with a large frame and well @-@ developed muscles , energetic , with easygoing and beautiful gaits . Members of the breed are described by the breed association as courageous and observant , as well as gentle and easy to handle . The head is generally small in proportion to the mass of the horse , and often snub , with a flat profile ( neither concave nor convex ) . The neck is of medium length and strong , often slightly arched . The withers are prominent and the shoulder long and slightly oblique . The back is short and straight and the body compact , solid and very muscular . The chest is deep , with a broad , muscular breast . The croup is wide and powerfully muscled . The hooves are hard and strong . 
 There are two main types of Trait du Nord . One is a heavier type bred for pulling heavy loads , while the other is a lighter type bred for slightly faster work , generally at the trot . Auxois , Ardennes , Brabant and some Dutch draft breeds may be admitted to the Trait du Nord studbook after being inspected and approved by a review panel . Registered horses are marked with a stylized " N " brand on the left side of the neck , signifying conformity to the breed standard . 
 = = History = = 
 The ancestors of the breed lived in the northern river valleys of the Sambre and the Scheldt , near Valenciennes . Although it is a popular myth that many French draft breeds , including the Trait du Nord , are descendants of the prehistoric horses found at <unk> , this is not true . Two or possibly three subspecies of now @-@ extinct equines have been found at <unk> , but there is no evidence that they migrated to the area that later produced the Trait du Nord . Like Dutch and Belgian draft breeds such as the Brabant , the origin of the Trait du Nord is found in the large , fertile Flemish grasslands that cover the southern portion of the Netherlands , northern France and all of Belgium . The Hainaut region is the true birthplace of the breed in France . The Belgian draft breeds , the Ardennes and the Trait du Nord share the same ancestry , and the Trait du Nord has a history that is very similar to the Ardennes , due to the influence of the latter breed on the former . The Ardennes , Belgian , Dutch Heavy Draft , Trait du Nord and Auxois are all considered to come from the same group of breeds , due to their heritage , physical characteristics and selection for draft work . Until relatively recently , the breeds were not differentiated , and were frequently crossbred . 
 The region of Flanders is particularly conducive to agriculture , and in the 19th century the draining of the swamps and improved farming techniques led to a major expansion in cultivated areas and farm sizes . As there were no existing horses in the area that were suitable for plowing , the farmers found it necessary to create a breed of draft horse specifically for their use . From the 1850s on , farmers selected horses that eventually became the Trait du Nord . The farmers combined large Belgian breeds adapted to swampy ground with the Ardennes and Dutch breeds for size , weight and strength . The result was a muscular , powerful , and tough breed with long legs that facilitated movement . The Trait du Nord was unique in being selected specifically for farming , as many draft breeds were also bred for use in transport . 
 The Trait du Nord proved a successful breed for the farmers that developed it , and quickly spread throughout the Netherlands , Belgium and northern France . It was given different names depending on the country , and was often confused with and crossbred with draft breeds from the Netherlands , Brabants and the Ardennes . Breed associations began to organize in the late 19th century , and at this point blood from the Boulonnais was introduced to bring more elegance to the breed . The Trait du Nord gradually began to differ from the Ardennes as they gained size and volume and improved their gaits , and the breed became popular in the north and east of France . In 1855 , even before the breed had been differentiated from the Ardennes , veterinarians described the heavy horses bred near Hainaut as superior to Flemish breeds . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 During World War I , Trait du Nord horses were among those confiscated by Germans from Belgium and France for use in the war . In 1919 , these horses were returned to their homeland , allowing the reconstruction of the breed . During World War II , the armed forces used all stocks of fuel , and the draft horse was used to continue agricultural production in France . After the war , farmers quickly equipped themselves with mechanized equipment . The decline in the breeding of the Trait du Nord became noticeable in the early 1950s , and by 1960 breed numbers had collapsed completely . By the early 1970s , breeding had slowed so much that the Trait du Nord , along with other French draft breeds , was in danger of extinction . 
 As horses were replaced by tractors , the production of horse meat became the main viable market for the Trait du Nord and other French breeds . As the horses were sought for meat , the larger , heavier animals became more in demand , and these horses lost much of their power and pulling ability . A French decree on August 24 , 1976 , published in the Official Journal , encouraged farmers to select the biggest , heaviest stallions for breeding . The French National Stud backed this decree , and encouraged the breeding of foals that would fatten rapidly , to be butchered at the age of eighteen months . Between the mid @-@ 20th century and the 1980s , the average weight of the Trait du Nord increased from between 800 and 900 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 800 and 2 @,@ 000 lb ) to over 1 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) . Since the early 1970s , the use of the Trait du Nord for meat has declined , contributing to a further reduction in breeding . 
 In the early 1990s , recreational riding experienced a revival , and the consumption of horse meat continued to decrease . On March 11 , 1994 , the Trait du Nord was officially declared to be a workhorse again , and in 1996 another decree prohibited docking of tails in horses . Members of the breed are occasionally exported from France , with some going to Italy , Belgium and Germany , mainly for work in logging and pulling brewery wagons . A few are sent to Sicily and Guadeloupe , but this is quite rare . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The Trait du Nord was originally used mainly for agriculture and mining . They also towed barges on waterways , although this use ended quickly with the increased use of the engine at the beginning of the 20th century . 
 The peak use of the breed for agriculture was quite short , running from 1880 to around 1960 ( ending due to increased use of mechanized equipment ) , but it allowed significant progress in agriculture in northern France . The stamina and energy of the breed allows them to perform well in the heavy and compact soils in the region of Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais and recover quickly after exercise . The nature of soils in Hainaut required a horse weighing more than 1 @,@ 800 pounds ( 800 kg ) for effective plowing . Since the 1950s , the Trait du Nord has been the preferred breed for farmers who practiced intensive cropping of cereals and beets in the Northern Great Plains of France . 
 The pulling power of the Trait du Nord made it popular for use during the Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century in heavy industry , including mining . In mines , steam engines and internal combustion engines could not be used due to the possibility of a gas explosion . The first horses were used in the mines in 1821 and the Trait du Nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts in the mines and operating the pulleys used to lift coal to the surface . Breeders worked to adapt the breed to mining requirements , and the breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads . Good horses were able to pull 16 @.@ 8 metric tons ( 16 @.@ 5 long tons ; 18 @.@ 5 short tons ) , usually around twelve cars worth , along a railway . As early as 1920 , the usage of horses in mines began to decline as electric locomotives came into use , and in 1969 the last horse was removed from the mines . 
 = = = 1990s and today = = = 
 Today , the breed is used mainly for meat and logging forested areas inaccessible to machinery . Since the mid @-@ 1990s , colts not intended for breeding , recreational riding , or harness work are heavily fed and sent out to slaughter before the age of eighteen months . Fillies are generally used for breeding . The breed association and its breeders are trying to secure the future of the Trait du Nord by finding new markets , especially in the areas of recreational riding , agricultural work , recreational and competitive driving . The breed is involved in several reenactments and folk villages which attract good crowds . The breed is promoted for its use in logging in forests and fragile areas , with professional foresters using them to preserve the value and biodiversity of forested areas . 
 The revival of team driving has prompted farmers who use the Trait du Nord to attend competitions and improve the quality of their horses . The qualities of the breed make it a popular horse for leaders in the areas of recreational and competition team driving , and the breed has the advantage of being able to be immediately returned to work even after a period of inactivity for several months . When being driven , a traditional " Flemish collar " is generally used . The horses are trained to be driven with only one rein , leaving the driver 's hands free for other work . When shown in hand , Trait du Nord horses are often presented in groups , generally between four and eight to a string . 
 Each year , the Trait du Nord is honored at an agricultural show and horse show in Paris . In 1995 , the breed won the International <unk> Trophy at the Paris show and in 2010 , a Trait du Nord took the first place prize for weight pulling at the show . Trait du Nord teams participate in the Route du Poisson , a relay race commemorating the route that teams took to bring fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris until the 19th century . The race takes place every two or three years and is the biggest equine relay race in Europe . 
 = = Breed preservation = = 
 The Trait du Nord is an endangered breed ; the Haras de Compiègne ( Compiegne Stud ) , a national stud in France , had a major influence in saving the breed , until it was closed in October 2009 . The national breed registry for the Trait du Nord is supported by other local initiatives . However , breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be implemented , and media attention on the Trait du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest . The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms , but even the number of farms has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle , which are more lucrative . 
 Although breed associations and the French National Stud are making efforts to protect the breed , very low numbers persist , and these organizations consider the breed very close to extinction . It is one of the most threatened French horse breeds . The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption , and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work . One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that the steady decline in breed numbers is proof that the breed is slowly disappearing . Beginning in 2011 , the Trait du Nord association is working with the North Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais regional council and other groups to increase the number of births by 20 percent by December 2014 , and double the number by 2020 . 
 The main breeding areas are located around the former Compiegne Stud and include the departments of Nord , the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais , the Oise , the Aisne and Somme . A few are found in the central region of Normandy and the Paris area . This breed is found mainly in France and is rarely exported abroad , or only very sporadically with related Belgian and Dutch breeds . A survey of mares in 2008 gave 121 mares in the region of North Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais , 46 in Picardy , 6 in Normandy and one to three mares in the other regions . 
 Despite efforts to revive interest in the breed , numbers steadily declined in the years before 1988 . In 1995 , there were 33 stallions in service ; in 1996 this number remained the same and by 1998 it had declined to 30 . In 2004 , there were 111 breeders and 119 Trait du Nord foals were registered . By 2007 and 2008 there were only 17 stallions registered , a number which is exposing the breed to a dangerous increase in inbreeding . To combat this danger , farmers are cross breeding the Trait du Nord with approved Belgian and Dutch horses . The number of farmers breeding the Trait du Nord decreased from 150 to 125 in 2002 , then to 92 in 2007 and 86 in 2008 . After birth rates remained relatively steady in the 1990s , they began to drop in the 2000s , declining from 176 in 2000 to 100 in 2005 and just 75 in 2007 .

 The All Hope Is Gone World Tour was a concert tour by Slipknot that took place in 2008 and 2009 in support of the group 's fourth studio album All Hope Is Gone . The tour consisted of nine legs and took place in the United States , Canada , Japan , Australia , New Zealand , and Europe . The tour started with the Mayhem Festival 2008 . 
 Lawrence Upton acted as the tour 's director , Philippe Vachon acted as the tour 's programmer and lighting co @-@ director , and Dave Watson as lighting designer . Equipment such as LED units and Martin Atomic 3000 <unk> were used on the rig , and instead of a media server , the GrandMA mixing console was used for MA Lighting . David " Shirt " Nicholls was positioned as audio mixer , working with the digital mixing console . 
 Slipknot headlined every performance throughout the tour , sometimes sharing headlining status at festival appearances . Supporting acts throughout the tour included Disturbed , DragonForce , Mastodon , Machine Head , Children of Bodom , Coheed and Cambria , Trivium , 3 Inches of Blood , DevilDriver , The Black Dahlia Murder , and <unk> . The tour consisted of nine legs and 153 shows , beginning on July 9 , 2008 and finishing on October 31 , 2009 . This was also the last tour with bassist Paul Gray who died on May 24 , 2010 . 
 <unk> Sid Wilson broke both of his heels after jumping from an elevated area of a stage and landing incorrectly . He performed all dates of the tour , in a wheelchair . Drummer Joey Jordison suffered a broken ankle , causing four concerts to be cancelled . Towards the end of the leg Fehn left the tour due to a " tragic death in his family " , forcing him to miss the final two dates of the leg in Spain .

 In early February 2008 , Mick Thomson confirmed that Slipknot would be performing at the 2008 Mayhem Festival . Corey Taylor said : " This summer we are truly bringing Mayhem . Slipknot is excited to be a part of it , and to be able to bring the new chapter of our history to the masses . We are already working , building and designing a new show . " The tour acted as a follow @-@ up to The Subliminal Verses World Tour , which took place in 2004 to promote their third studio album Vol . 3 : ( The Subliminal Verses ) . The band began recording their fourth studio album All Hope Is Gone in late February 2008 .

 Lawrence Upton acted as the tour 's director , and Philippe Vachon acted as the tour 's programmer and lighting co @-@ director . Vachon said Upton wanted " very aggressive lighting that would attack and have punch " , because Slipknot 's music was very aggressive . Up @-@ stage provided the gear package , which included 10 Martin Professional MAC Profiles and 54 Martin Mac 2000 Wash units . Assistant lighting designer Dave Watson explained that the Martin Professional MAC Profiles were used as " key lights " , while Martin Mac 2000 Wash units generated higher light output . Issues arose during the tour , specifically times when members were barely visible due to the lighting . Vachon said , " There is so much show in your face that we would lose the guys on stage ; we had to beef up the front @-@ of @-@ house [ with ] white . " 
 The rig consisted of a Front of House truss , two three @-@ quarter angled trusses , and two straight mid @-@ stage trusses . These were all located up @-@ stage , and had two sub @-@ hung trusses directly below them . There were two Lycian <unk> medium @-@ throw truss spots , and an accumulation of specialty lights . The specialty lights included 54 two @-@ light Molefays , six PAR 36 rotating beacons , 24 Martin Atomic 300 <unk> , 2 six @-@ light Molefays , and 10 four @-@ light Molefays . The rig also had LED units , which can be very bright , and which shone into the audience . Throughout the tour , 65 Philips Color Kinetics <unk> 12s , seven Color Blaze 48s , and twelve CK <unk> 72s were used to light up the wall behind the band . 
 Instead of a media server , the GrandMA console was used for MA Lighting . Vachon explained that the GrandMA console was " the desk you can do the most with LEDs ; if you want to go further , you need a media <unk> . " The assistant lighting designer used a full @-@ sized GrandMA console . Two <unk> provided the necessary extra channels . The show 's color palette was somewhat restricted . There was mostly white lights , but Upton used lighter colors to get the most light output . The original palette was also based on colors like amber , steel blue , sea green , and orange . Late in the tour Vachon would add additional bursts of color , which included intense oranges , reds , and violets .

 David " Shirt " Nicholls was the audio mixer , using a Digidesign Venue with both the Eventide Anthology Pack , which provided sound effects , and Venue Pro Pack , which was a complete digital mixing console . Nicholls has expressed his admiration for the Venue Pro Pack and also explained that the A @-@ T <unk> microphones which he used on the tour took a battering during shows . Nicholls has called the <unk> vocal microphones he used " bulletproof " as they would occasionally " go flying up into the seats " during shows but would still work the next show .

 At the end of the 2008 Mayhem Festival , drummer Joey Jordison broke his ankle . During an interview with Drummer , Jordison explained that the injury happened when he and a friend were " messing around and kinda wrestling with each other " one afternoon , and Jordison tripped and twisted his ankle . Despite the injury , Jordison could still walk and subsequently played the next night . However , during a lengthy double bass section of " The Blister Exists " he " felt a snap " in his ankle . A doctor confirmed he had broken his ankle and suggested surgery . Jordison continued to play with a broken ankle until the band finished the Mayhem Festival . Following the festival Jordison was told that if he continued to play , he could suffer permanent damage that could affect his ability to walk . Subsequently , Slipknot were forced to cancel their European festival appearances due to the injury . On August 22 , at Leeds Festival during the Dropkick Murphys performance , a plane flew above the open air crowd advertising tickets for Slipknot 's UK dates in December . Unhappy with the fact that the band had pulled out of the festival , the crowd began to boo at the banner advert .

" When reviewing the same show , Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald compared Slipknot 's performance to their appearance at the 2005 Big Day Out festival , noting that " the gruesome obscenities , the vomiting , and fights " were absent , which made for " a far tighter and more solid " performance .

 = Bristol Rovers F.C. = 
 Bristol Rovers Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city of Bristol , England . They compete in League One , the third tier of English football . The team plays their home matches at Memorial Stadium , in Horfield , a suburb of Bristol , and is affiliated to the Gloucestershire County FA . 
 The club was founded in 1883 as Black Arabs F.C. , and were also known as Eastville Rovers and Bristol Eastville Rovers before finally changing its name to Bristol Rovers in 1899 . The club 's official nickname is The Pirates , reflecting the maritime history of Bristol . The local nickname of the club is The Gas , from the gasworks next to their former home Eastville Stadium , which started as a derogatory term used by fans of their main rival Bristol City but was affectionately adopted by the team . According to a survey conducted in December 2003 , Cardiff City and Swindon Town are considered their second and third biggest rivals . 
 Rovers were admitted to the Football League in 1920 and have played there ever since , apart from spending the 2014 – 15 season in the Conference Premier . They previously came close to losing their league status in 1939 , when they were re @-@ elected after finishing bottom of Division Three ( South ) , and in 2002 when the team finished one league position away from relegation to the Football Conference . Their highest finishing positions were in 1956 and 1959 , on both occasions ending the season in 6th place in Division Two , then the second tier of English football . Rovers were Football League Trophy finalists in 1990 and 2007 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 The club was formed following a meeting at the Eastville Restaurant in Bristol in September 1883 . It was initially called Black Arabs F.C. , after the Arabs rugby team and the predominantly black kits in which they played . This name only lasted for the 1883 – 84 season , and in a bid to draw more fans from the local area the club was renamed Eastville Rovers in 1884 . 
 The club played only friendly games until the 1887 – 88 season , when it took part in the Gloucestershire Cup for the first time . In 1892 the club became a founder member of the Bristol and District League , which three years later was renamed the Western League . In 1897 Eastville Rovers joined the Birmingham and District League , and for two seasons played in both this league and the Western League . At the beginning of the 1897 – 98 season , the club turned professional and changed its name to Bristol Eastville Rovers , and on 17 February 1899 the name was officially changed to Bristol Rovers . In 1899 Bristol Rovers joined the newly formed Southern League , where they remained until 1920 , winning the league title along the way in 1905 . 
 = = = Into the Football League = = = 
 For the 1920 – 21 season , the Southern League teams were moved into the new Division Three of the Football League , which became Division Three ( South ) the following season . They remained in this division for over 30 years , before winning the league , and promotion in the 1952 – 53 season . 
 The team has won promotion on four other occasions : in 1973 – 74 from the Third Division to the Second Division , again in 1989 – 90 as Division Three champions , in 2006 – 07 to the Football League One , and then in 2014 – 15 to League Two from the Conference Premier . The club has been relegated six times — in 1961 – 62 , 1980 – 81 , 1992 – 93 , 2000 – 01 , 2010 – 11 and most recently at the end of the 2013 – 14 season . 
 The highest position in the football ladder achieved by Rovers at the end of season is sixth place in the second tier , which they did twice ; once in 1955 – 56 , and again in 1958 – 59 . The closest they came to the top flight was in 1955 – 56 , when they ended the season just four points below the promotion positions . The lowest league position achieved by the club is twenty @-@ third out of twenty @-@ four teams in the fourth tier , which has occurred twice . In the 2001 – 02 season , relegation from the Football League was narrowly avoided on two counts ; firstly they ended just one league position above the relegation zone , and secondly the rules were changed the following season to increase the number of relegation places to two , meaning that if Rovers had finished in that position one year later they would have been relegated . This position was matched at the end of the 2013 – 14 season , which this time saw Rovers relegated to the Conference for the first time . They returned to the league at the end of their first Conference season , with a penalty shootout victory over Grimsby Town in the play @-@ off final . 
 = = = Cup competitions = = = 
 The only major cup competition won by Bristol Rovers is the 1972 Watney Cup , when they beat Sheffield United in the final . The club also won the Division Three ( South ) Cup in 1934 – 35 , as well as winning or sharing the Gloucestershire Cup on 32 occasions . The team has never played in European competition ; the closest Rovers came was when they missed out on reaching the international stage of the Anglo @-@ Italian Cup in the 1992 – 93 season on a coin toss held over the phone with West Ham United . 
 In the FA Cup , Rovers have reached the quarter @-@ final stage on three occasions . The first time was in 1950 – 51 when they faced Newcastle United at St James ' Park in front of a crowd of 62 @,@ 787 , the record for the highest attendance at any Bristol Rovers match .

Other rivals are mainly other teams from the West Country , such as Swindon Town , Plymouth Argyle , Exeter City and Yeovil Town . Since relegation to the Conference , a rivalry has also emerged with Forest Green Rovers . 
 In the past , rivalries also emerged with Severnside rivals Cardiff City known as the Severnside derby . Rovers most recent meeting against Cardiff was a League Cup match on 26 August 2009 , which Cardiff went on to win 3 – 1 . This game took place at the new Cardiff City Stadium and the Rovers only goal from the game came from Steve Elliot . The last time Cardiff and Bristol Rovers were in the same league was in the 1999 – 2000 season . 
 Bristol Rovers and Plymouth Argyle have played each other 92 times in the Football League and in national cup competitions , with the better record belonging to The Pilgrims due to their 36 wins compared with Rovers ' 30 .

Because of the close proximity many players have also represented both the clubs , for example Adam Virgo , Gavin Williams , Dominic Blizzard and Tom Parkes . 
 = = Colours and badge = = 
 Bristol Rovers are known for their distinctive blue and white quartered shirts , which they have worn for most of their history . The current home kit consists of a light blue and white quartered shirt and white shorts , while the away kit is black and gold with the same colours as the trim . During the 2008 – 09 season a special third strip , which is black with a gold sash , and is a reproduction of the original Black Arab shirt , was used for a single match to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the club . 
 The team began playing in black shirts with a yellow sash from their foundation in 1883 as Black Arabs F.C. until 1885 , by which time they were called Eastville Rovers . For the next fourteen years , until 1899 , the team wore blue and white hooped shirts . These were replaced by black and white striped shirts until 1919 . 
 When Rovers were admitted to The Football League in 1920 they wore white shirts with blue shorts . These remained the team colours until 1930 , when the colours were reversed to blue shirts and white shorts for one season . The blue and white quarters were first worn in 1931 , when they were introduced to try to make the players look larger and more intimidating . Rovers continued to wear the quarters for 31 years until they were replaced by blue pinstripes on a white background . 
 Over the next ten years , Rovers went on to wear blue and white stripes , all blue , and blue shirts with white shorts before returning to the blue and white quarters in 1973 , which have remained the colours ever since . During the 1996 – 97 season , Rovers wore an unpopular striped quartered design , prompting fans to refer to it as the Tesco bag shirts because of their similarity to the design used for the company 's carrier bags . The change in design prompted the Trumpton Times fanzine to change its name to Wot , No Quarters ? 
 The black and gold shirts were also used as the away kit for the 2002 – 03 season , the club 's 120th anniversary . 
 In 2005 , Rovers ran an April Fools ' joke on their official website , stating that the team 's new away strip would be all pink . Although this was intended to be a joke , a number of fans petitioned the club to get the kit made for real , and also suggested that funds raised through the sale of the pink shirts should be donated to a breast cancer charity . Although the pink shirts were never used in a competitive fixture , they were worn for a pre @-@ season friendly against Plymouth Argyle in 2006 . 
 A pirate features on both the club badge and the badge of the supporters club , reflecting the club nickname of The Pirates . Previous club badges have featured a blue and white quartered design , based on the quartered design of the team 's jerseys . 
 = = = Kit suppliers and sponsors = = = 
 Rovers first used an official kit supplier in 1977 , and the club 's first official kit sponsor followed in 1981 . Rovers ' longest running kit supplier is <unk> who supplied the club kits for eleven years ( 2005 – 16 ) . The club 's longest running kit sponsorship was from local company <unk> Construction who sponsored the club for a total of 11 years before ending the deal in 2009 . 
 The <unk> deal came to an end during the late @-@ 2000s recession . Faced with the prospect of having no shirt sponsor for the 2009 – 10 season , the club came up with the idea of a raffle to raise the funds required . Tickets were sold at £ 1 @,@ 000 with all 96 available being sold meaning the club raised £ 96 @,@ 000 for one season of shirt sponsorship , more than some Premier League clubs . First prize in the draw went to local training and recruitment company N @-@ <unk> whose logo appeared on that season 's home kit . Second prize went to Bristol @-@ based solicitors Stevens , Hewlett & Perkins whose logo appeared on the away kit . The raffle proved so successful that the club replicated it for the 2010 – 11 season with Smart Computers becoming the new home kit sponsors and <unk> Linen the away sponsors . Despite initially planning to return to the tradition form of sponsorship , the club again ran a sponsorship raffle for the 2011 – 12 season and continues to this day , however , with the plans to move to UWE Stadium , Rovers hope to attract a major sponsor once again in the future .

 = = = History = = = 
 Rovers play their home games at The Memorial Stadium in Horfield , a ground they formerly shared with Bristol Rugby Club . The team moved to The Mem , as it is known informally , at the beginning of the 1996 – 97 season , initially as tenants but purchased it two years later . 
 When Bristol Rovers were known as Black Arabs F.C. in 1883 , they played their home games at <unk> , Stapleton . The following year they moved to Three Acres , the precise location of which is not known , but is believed to have been in the Ashley Down area of Bristol , where they remained for seven years . This was followed by brief stays at the <unk> Cricket Ground , Durdham Down and Ridgeway . 
 For the majority of their history , Bristol Rovers have played their home games at the Eastville Stadium , where they remained for a period of 89 years from 1897 – 1986 . Financial problems led to the team being forced to leave Eastville , and they found a temporary home at Twerton Park , the home of Bath City . They stayed in Bath for 10 seasons , before returning to Bristol in 1996 . 
 Rovers also played five home games at Ashton Gate Stadium , home of rivals Bristol City , following a fire which destroyed the South Stand of the Eastville Stadium on the night of the 16 – 17 August 1980 . Rovers returned to Eastville in October 1980 . During World War II , some friendly matches were played in Kingswood , and in their early history some games were played at Parson Street , Bedminster 
 In January 2007 planning permission was granted for a new 18 @,@ 500 capacity all @-@ seater stadium to be built on the site of the Memorial Stadium . Building work was originally intended to begin late in 2007 , but a number of delays set the project back first until the summer of 2008 , and then until the summer of 2009 . 
 Further delays meant that by 2011 , the club had begun exploring different options with regards to the future of the club 's stadium . In June 2011 , the club announced its intention to relocate the club to a new 21 @,@ 700 all seater stadium , to be built on land at the University of the West of England 's Frenchay campus . To fund the project , the current site of the Memorial Stadium will be sold to supermarket Sainsbury 's . 
 In September 2012 , planning permission for the proposed UWE Stadium was granted by South Gloucestershire Council . In January 2013 , subsequent planning permission was granted by Bristol City Council for the building of a Sainsbury 's supermarket on the site of the Memorial Stadium . Disputes by a local protest group delayed the project and was followed by Sainsbury 's attempting to withdraw support for the project . Rovers therefore submitted a writ against Sainsbury 's , the hearing for which will be heard in May 2015 . 
 In February 2016 it was announced that a 92 % stake in the club had been bought by the Jordanian Al @-@ Qadi family and that <unk> Al @-@ Qadi , a member of the Jordan Football Association , would become the president . 
 The club is now owned by Dwane Sports Ltd with 92 @.@ 6 % of the shares with Bristol Rovers Supporters Club owning the remaining 7 @.@ 4 % . 
 = = Supporter culture = = 
 The team traditionally draws the majority of its support from north and east Bristol and South Gloucestershire . Many towns and villages in the surrounding area are also home to significant pockets of Rovers supporters . 
 The nickname given to Bristol Rovers supporters is " Gasheads " . " The Gas " was originally coined as a derogatory term by the supporters of Bristol Rovers ' rivals Bristol City , and was in reference to the large gas works adjacent to the old Bristol Rovers stadium , in Eastville , Bristol which wafted the sometimes overpowering odour of town gas across the crowd . " Gasheads " was adopted as a name by a splinter group of Rovers supporters in the mid @-@ 1980s to early 1990s . The chant " Proud to be a <unk> " spread to regular fans , and a fanzine was produced called The <unk> . 
 The term " Gasheads " is now universally accepted within the English media and football fraternity as referring to Bristol Rovers supporters . After the club 's relegation to Football League Two in 2001 , the club designated the squad number 12 to the Gasheads to signify them as the club 's 12th Man in recognition of their loyal support . 
 The retired Conservative MP for Hayes and Harlington Terry Dicks is a Bristol Rovers fan . He mentioned the club in parliament on 5 May 1994 when debating with Labour MP and Chelsea fan Tony Banks . Another notable fan is Mercury Prize winning DJ Roni Size . 
 One Bristol Rovers print fanzine is currently active and is entitled Last Saturday Night . There is also a fan @-@ run podcast and blog called <unk> . 
 = = = Club song = = = 
 The song which is synonymous with Rovers is " Goodnight , Irene " , which was written by Lead Belly . 
 Opinions differ as to how this came about but it is thought to have become popular in the 1950s when a version of the song was in the British charts — the line " sometimes I have a great notion to jump in the river and drown " — seemed to be particularly apt when Rovers lost as the Bristol Frome flows alongside the old Eastville ground . Another theory is that it was sung at a fireworks display at the Stadium the night before a Home game against Plymouth Argyle in the 1950s . During the game the following day , Rovers were winning quite comfortably and the few Argyle supporters present began to leave early prompting a chorus of " Goodnight Argyle " from the Rovers supporters — the tune stuck and Irene became the club song . 
 Another popular Bristol Rovers song is " Tote End Boys " , which was written and sung by Ben <unk> . The name " Tote End Boys " derives from the section of Gasheads who stood in the Tote End terrace at Rovers ' old home , Eastville Stadium . 
 The Rovers fans have good relations with Spanish club CE Sabadell FC , which initially began due to several Rovers fans noticing that the club had the same colours . Plans are being made for a pre @-@ season friendly between the two clubs in July 2016 .

Chris Lines also graduated from the academy before moving on to Sheffield Wednesday . Lines has recently returned to Rovers . Perhaps the most successful former member of the academy is Scott Sinclair , who was signed by Chelsea in 2005 for an initial fee of £ 200 @,@ 000 , with further payments to the club possible , depending on performance . He currently plays for Premier League club Aston Villa . Other recent Academy players to have appeared in the Premier League or Football League include Tyrone <unk> , Eliot Richards , Sean Rigg and <unk> Santos . 
 = = Women 's team = = 
 The club had a successful women 's team , formed in 1998 as Bristol Rovers W.F.C. following a merger with Cable @-@ Tel <unk> .. This merger came about as Bristol Rovers only had girls teams up to the under 16 age group level , so when girls reached the age of 16 they were forced to leave the club . The merger with Cable @-@ Tel meant that Bristol Rovers had a senior squad . The club 's name was changed to Bristol Academy W.F.C. in 2005 to reflect the increased investment from the Bristol Academy of Sport . Though sometimes still referred to by their former nickname , the Gas Girls , Bristol Academy W.F.C. are no longer affiliated to Bristol Rovers .
