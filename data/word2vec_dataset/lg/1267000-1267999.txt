 On taking office as Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown gave the Bank of England operational independence in monetary policy , and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank 's Monetary Policy Committee . At the same time he also changed the inflation measure from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority . Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the 2007 global banking crisis . 
 = = = Taxation and spending = = = 
 In the 1997 election and subsequently , Brown pledged not to increase the basic or higher rates of income tax . Over his Chancellorship , he reduced the basic rate from 23 % to 20 % . However , in all but his final budget , Brown increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation , rather than earnings , resulting in fiscal drag . Corporation tax fell under Brown , from a main rate of 33 % to 28 % , and from 24 % to 19 % for small businesses . In 1999 , he introduced a lower tax band of 10 % . He abolished this 10 % tax band in his last budget in 2007 to reduce the basic rate from 22 % to 20 % , increasing tax for 5 million people and , according to the calculations of the Institute for Fiscal Studies , leaving those earning between £ 5 @,@ 000 and £ 18 @,@ 000 as the biggest losers . To backbench cheers , Brown had described the measure in his last Budget thus : " Having put in place more focused ways of <unk> work and directly supporting children and pensioners at a cost of £ <unk> a year , I can now return income tax to just two rates by removing the 10p band on non savings income " . 
 According to the OECD UK taxation increased from a 39 @.@ 3 % share of gross domestic product in 1997 to 42 @.@ 4 % in 2006 , going to a higher level than that of Germany . This increase has mainly been attributed to active government policy , and not simply to the growing economy . Conservatives have accused Brown of imposing " stealth taxes " . A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way corporation tax is collected , the indirect effect of which was for the dividends on stock investments held within pensions to be taxed , thus lowering pension returns and contributing to the demise of most of the final salary pension funds in the UK . The Treasury contends that this tax change was crucial to long @-@ term economic growth . 
 Brown 's 2000 Spending Review outlined a major expansion of government spending , particularly on health and education . In his April 2002 budget , Brown increased National Insurance to pay for health spending . He also introduced working tax credits , and in his last budget as Chancellor , Brown gave an extra £ 3 billion in pension allowances , an increase in the child tax credit , and an increase in the working tax credit . These increases were followed by another £ 1 billion of support for increases in the child tax credit . 
 = = = European single currency = = = 
 In October 1997 , Brown took control of the United Kingdom 's membership of the European single currency issue by announcing the Treasury would set five economic tests to ascertain whether the economic case had been made . In June 2003 the Treasury indicated the tests had not been passed . 
 = = = Other issues = = = 
 In 2000 , Brown was accused of starting a political row about higher education ( referred to as the Laura Spence Affair ) when he accused the University of Oxford of elitism in its admissions procedures , describing its decision not to offer a place to state school pupil Laura Spence as " absolutely outrageous " . Lord Jenkins , then Oxford Chancellor and himself a former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer , said " nearly every fact he used was false . " 
 Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60 % of the UK 's gold reserves shortly before gold entered a protracted bull market , since nicknamed by dealers as Brown Bottom . The official reason for selling the gold reserves was to reduce the portfolio risk of the UK 's reserves by diversifying away from gold . The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002 , at an average price of about US $ 275 per ounce , raising approximately US $ 3 @.@ 5 billion . By 2011 , that quantity of gold would be worth over $ 19 billion , leading to Brown 's decision to sell the gold being widely criticised . 
 As Chancellor , Brown argued against <unk> the railways , saying at the Labour conference in 2004 that it would cost £ 22 billion . 
 During his time as Chancellor , Brown reportedly believed that it was appropriate to remove most , but not all , of the unpayable Third World debt . On 20 April 2006 , in a speech to the United Nations Ambassadors , Brown outlined a " Green " view of global development . 
 = = Run @-@ up to succeeding Tony Blair = = 
 In October 2004 , Tony Blair announced he would not lead the party into a fourth general election , but would serve a full third term . Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the 2005 election , which Labour won with a reduced majority and reduced vote share . Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year . Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair ; he was the only candidate spoken of seriously in Westminster . Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become Prime Minister , in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and global change . This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as Prime Minister ; speaking at a Fabian Society conference on ' The Next Decade ' in January 2007 , he stressed education , international development , narrowing inequalities ( to pursue ' equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome ' ) , renewing Britishness , restoring trust in politics , and winning hearts and minds in the war on terror as key priorities . 
 = = Prime Minister ( 2007 – 10 ) = = 
 Brown ceased to be Chancellor and became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 27 June 2007 . Like all modern Prime Ministers , Brown concurrently served as the First Lord of the Treasury and the Minister for the Civil Service , and was a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom . Until his resignation from the post in May 2010 he was Leader of the Labour Party . He was Member of Parliament for the constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath until he stepped down in 2015 . He is the sixth post @-@ war Prime Minister , of a total of 12 , to assume the role without having won a general election . Brown was the first Prime Minister from a Scottish constituency since the Conservative Sir Alec Douglas @-@ Home in 1964 . Not all British Prime Ministers have attended university , but of the ones that did Brown was one of only five that did not attend either Oxford or Cambridge , the others were , The Earl of Bute ( Leiden ) , Lord John Russell ( Edinburgh ) , Bonar Law ( Glasgow ) , and Neville Chamberlain ( Mason Science College , later Birmingham ) . Brown proposed moving some traditional prime ministerial powers conferred by royal prerogative to the realm of Parliament , such as the power to declare war and approve appointments to senior positions . Brown wanted Parliament to gain the right to ratify treaties and have more oversight into the intelligence services . He also proposed moving some powers from Parliament to citizens , including the right to form " citizens ' juries " , easily petition Parliament for new laws , and rally outside Westminster . He asserted that the attorney general should not have the right to decide whether to prosecute in individual cases , such as in the loans for peerages scandal . 
 There was speculation during September and early October 2007 about whether Brown would call a snap general election . Indeed , the party launched the Not Flash , Just Gordon advertising campaign , which was seen largely as pre @-@ election promotion of Brown as Prime Minister . However , Brown announced on 6 October that there would be no election any time soon – despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election should he call one . This proved to be a costly mistake , as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives ( led by David Cameron ) in the polls . Disputes over political donations , a string of losses in local elections , and by @-@ election losses in Crewe and Glasgow did himself and the government no favours either . 
 His political opponents accused him of being indecisive , which Brown denied . In July 2008 Brown supported a new bill extending the pre @-@ charge detention period to 42 days . The bill was met with opposition on both sides of the House and backbench rebellion . In the end the bill passed by just 9 votes . The House of Lords defeated the bill , with Lords characterising it as " fatally flawed , ill thought through and unnecessary " , stating that " it seeks to further erode fundamental legal and civil rights " . 
 Brown was mentioned by the press in the expenses crisis for claiming for the payment of his cleaner . However , no wrongdoing was found and the Commons Authority did not pursue Brown over the claim . Meanwhile , the Commons Fees Office stated that a double payment for a £ 153 plumbing repair bill was a mistake on their part and that Brown had repaid it in full . 
 = = = Domestic policy = = = 
 During his Labour leadership campaign Brown proposed some policy initiatives which he called the manifesto for change . 
 The manifesto included a clampdown on corruption and a new Ministerial Code , which set out clear standards of behaviour for ministers . Brown also stated in a speech when announcing his bid that he wants a " better constitution " that is " clear about the rights and responsibilities of being a citizen in Britain today " . He planned to set up an all @-@ party convention to look at new powers for Parliament and to look at <unk> powers between Whitehall and local government . Brown said he would give Parliament the final say on whether British troops are sent into action in future . 
 Brown said he wanted to release more land and ease access to ownership with shared equity schemes . He backed a proposal to build new eco @-@ towns , each housing between 10 @,@ 000 and 20 @,@ 000 home @-@ owners – up to 100 @,@ 000 new homes in total . Brown also said he wanted to have doctors ' surgeries open at the weekends , and GPs on call in the evenings . Doctors were given the right of opting out of out @-@ of @-@ hours care in 2007 , under a controversial pay deal , signed by then @-@ Health Secretary John Reid , which awarded them a 22 percent pay rise in 2006 . Brown also stated in the manifesto that the NHS was his top priority . 
 On 5 June 2007 , just three weeks before he was due to take the post of Prime Minister , Brown made a speech promising " British Jobs for British workers " . Brown reiterated that promise at the Labour Party 's annual conference in September , which caused controversy as he coupled this with a commitment to crack down on migrant workers . The Conservative Party , led by David Cameron , promptly pointed out that such a commitment was illegal under EU law . 
 = = = Foreign policy = = = 
 Brown was committed to the Iraq War , but said in a speech in June 2007 that he would " learn the lessons " from the mistakes made in Iraq . Brown said in a letter published on 17 March 2008 that the United Kingdom would hold an inquiry into the war . He is also a member of the lobby group , Labour Friends of Israel . 
 Brown went to great lengths to empathise with those who lost family members in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts . He has often said " War is tragic " , echoing Blair 's quote , " War is horrible " . Nonetheless , in November 2007 Brown was accused by some senior military figures of not adhering to the Military Covenant , a convention within British politics ensuring adequate safeguards , rewards and compensation for military personnel who risk their lives in obedience to orders derived from the policy of the elected government . 
 Brown skipped the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics , on 8 August 2008 in Beijing . He attended the closing ceremony instead , on 24 August 2008 . Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners to send a message to China , concerning the 2008 Tibetan unrest . His decision not to attend the opening ceremony was not an act of protest , but rather was made several weeks in advance and not intended as a stand on principle . 
 In a speech in July 2007 , Brown clarified his position regarding Britain 's relationship with the USA " We will not allow people to separate us from the United States of America in dealing with the common challenges that we face around the world . I think people have got to remember that the special relationship between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share , the same enduring values about the importance of liberty , opportunity , the dignity of the individual . I will continue to work , as Tony Blair did , very closely with the American administration . " 
 Brown and the Labour party had pledged to allow a referendum on the EU Treaty of Lisbon . On 13 December 2007 , Foreign Secretary David Miliband attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty . Brown 's opponents on both sides of the House , and in the press , suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held . Labour 's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British public a referendum on the original EU Constitution . Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution , and as such did not require a referendum . He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic , and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum . 
 = = = Drug policy = = = 
 During Brown 's premiership , in October 2008 , the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) recommended to the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that cannabis remain classified as a Class C drug . Acting against the advice of the Council , she chose to reclassify it as Class B. After Professor David Nutt , the chair of the ACMD , criticised this move in a lecture in 2009 , he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary Alan Johnson . Following his resignation , Professor Nutt said Brown had " made up his mind " to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary . Brown had argued , " I don 't think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people — this is not acceptable " . Professor Nutt 's predecessor at the ACMD , Sir Michael Rawlins , later said , " Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view ... When that happens , then the government should explain why it 's ignoring the particular advice " . 
 = = = Global recession = = = 
 Brown 's premiership coincided with the global recession , during which Brown called for fiscal action in an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand . Domestically , Brown 's administration introduced measures including a bank rescue package worth around £ 500 billion ( approximately $ 850 billion ) , a temporary 2 @.@ 5 % cut in value @-@ added tax and a " car scrappage " scheme . 
 = = = Plots against leadership = = = 
 In mid @-@ 2008 , Brown 's leadership was presented with a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign . This event was dubbed the ' Lancashire Plot ' , as two backbenchers from ( pre @-@ 1974 ) Lancashire urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of holding on to the Labour Party leadership . Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009 , he should call for a leadership contest . However , certain prominent MPs , such as Jacqui Smith and Bill Rammell , suggested that Brown was the right person to lead Britain through its economic crisis . In the Autumn , <unk> McDonagh , a MP and junior government whip , who during her time in office had never voted against the government , spoke of the need for discussion over Brown 's position . McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterwards , on 12 September . Whilst McDonagh did not state that she wanted Brown deposed , she implored the Labour party to hold a leadership election , she was sacked from her role shortly afterwards . McDonagh was supported by Joan Ryan ( who applied , as McDonagh had , for leadership nomination papers , and became the second rebel to be fired from her job ) , Jim Dowd , Greg Pope , and a string of others who had previously held positions in government , made clear their desire for a contest . In the face of this speculation over Brown 's future , his ministers backed him to lead the party , and Harriet Harman and David Miliband denied that they were preparing leadership bids . After Labour lost the Glasgow East by @-@ election in July , Harman , the deputy leader of the party , said that Brown was the " solution " , not the " problem " ; Home Secretary Smith , Justice Secretary Jack Straw , Schools Secretary Ed Balls and Cabinet Office Minister Ed Miliband all re @-@ affirmed their support for Brown . The deputy Prime Minister under Blair , John Prescott , also pledged his support . Foreign Secretary David Miliband then denied that he was plotting a leadership bid , when on 30 July , an article written by him in The Guardian was interpreted by a large number in the media as an attempt to undermine Brown . In the article , Miliband outlined the party 's future , but neglected to mention the Prime Minister . Miliband , responded to this by saying that he was confident Brown could lead Labour to victory in the next general election , and that his article was an attack against the fatalism in the party since the loss of Glasgow @-@ East . Miliband continued to show his support for Brown in the face of the challenge that emerged in September , as did Business Secretary John Hutton , Environment Secretary Hilary Benn , and Chief Whip Geoff Hoon . 
 On 6 January 2010 , Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon jointly called for a secret ballot on the future of Brown 's leadership . The call received little support and the following day Hoon said that it appeared to have failed and was " over " . Brown later referred to the call for a secret ballot as a " form of silliness " . 
 = = = By @-@ elections and 2009 local and EU elections = = = 
 In the local elections on 1 May 2008 , Labour suffered their worst results in 40 years finishing in third place with a projected 24 % share of the national vote . Subsequently the party has seen the loss of by @-@ elections in Nantwich and Crewe and Henley as well as slumps in the polls . A by @-@ election in Glasgow East triggered by the resignation of David Marshall saw the Labour party struggle to appoint a candidate , eventually settling for Margaret Curran , a sitting MSP in the Scottish Parliament . The SNP , Conservatives and Liberal Democrats all derided Labour for their disorganised nature , with Alex Salmond commenting " This is their ' lost weekend ' — they don 't have a leader in Scotland , they don 't have a candidate in Glasgow East , and they have a prime minister who refuses to come to the constituency " . Labour lost the constituency to the Scottish National Party 's John Mason who took 11 @,@ 277 votes with Labour just 365 behind . The seat experienced a swing of 22 @.@ 54 % . 
 In the European elections , Labour polled 16 % of the vote , finishing in third place behind the Conservatives and UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) . Voter apathy was reflected in the historically low turnout of around thirty three percent . In Scotland voter turnout was only twenty eight per cent . In the local elections , Labour polled 23 % of the vote , finishing in third place behind Conservatives and Liberal Democrats , with Labour losing control of the four councils it had held prior to the election . In a vote widely considered to be a reaction to the expenses scandal , the share of the votes was down for all the major parties ; Labour was down one percent , the Conservative share was down five percent . The beneficiary of the public backlash was generally seen to be the minor parties , including the Green Party and UKIP . These results were Labour 's worst since World War II . Brown was quoted in the press as having said that the results were " a painful defeat for Labour " , and that " too many good people doing so much good for their communities and their constituencies have lost through no fault of their own . "

 In April 2010 , Brown asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament . The General Election campaign included the first televised leadership debates in Britain .

 Brown announced on 10 May 2010 that he would stand down as Labour Leader , with a view to a successor being chosen before the next Labour Party Conference in September 2010 . The following day , negotiations between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government failed . During the evening , Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to Queen Elizabeth II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition , David Cameron , to form a government . He resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect .

 On 13 May 2010 , in his first public appearance since leaving 10 Downing Street , two days after resigning as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party , Brown confirmed he intended to stay on in Parliament , serving as a Labour backbencher , to serve the people of his Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency . 
 Towards the end of May 2010 , Brown began writing Beyond the Crash , completing it after 14 weeks . The book discusses the 2007 – 08 financial crisis and Brown 's recommendations for future co @-@ ordinated global action . 
 He played a prominent role in the lead @-@ up to , and the aftermath of , the 2014 Scottish independence referendum .

Following the arrest of Strauss @-@ Kahn for alleged sexual assault in May 2011 , and his subsequent resignation , these reports re @-@ surfaced . Support for Brown among economists was mixed but British Government backing for his candidature was not forthcoming and instead supported Christine Lagarde – the eventual successful candidate – for the post .

 Sir Tim Berners @-@ Lee , who had worked with the government during Brown 's premiership to publish government data on the internet in the <unk> project , subsequently invited Brown to become a board director of the World Wide Web Foundation to " advise the Web Foundation on ways to involve disadvantaged communities and global leaders in the development of sustainable programs that connect humanity and affect positive change " . On 22 April 2011 it was announced that Brown would be taking on an unpaid advisory role at the World Economic Forum . Brown was also appointed as the inaugural ' Distinguished Leader in Residence ' by New York University and has already taken part in discussions and lectures relating to the global financial crisis and globalisation . 
 In July 2012 Brown was named by Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon as a United Nations Special Envoy on Global Education . The position is unpaid . 
 In December 2015 , Brown took his first large @-@ scale role in the private sector since standing down as prime minister in 2010 , becoming an advisor to <unk> . Any money earned from the role is to go to the Gordon and Sarah Brown Foundation to support charitable work .

 Brown 's early girlfriends included the journalist Sheena McDonald and Princess Margarita , the eldest daughter of exiled King Michael of Romania . At the age of 49 , Brown married Sarah Macaulay in a private ceremony at his home in North Queensferry , Fife , on 3 August 2000 . On 28 December 2001 a daughter , Jennifer Jane , was born prematurely and died on 7 January 2002 one day after suffering a brain haemorrhage . They have two sons , John Macaulay ( born 17 October 2003 ) and ( James ) Fraser ( born on 18 July 2006 ) . In November 2006 , Fraser was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis . The Sun had learned of the situation in 2006 and published the story . In 2011 Brown stated he had wanted the details of his son 's condition kept private and that the publication had left him " in tears " . The Sun said they approached Brown and that discussion occurred with his colleagues who provided quotes to use in the article . 
 Sarah Brown rarely makes official appearances either with or without her husband . She is patron of several charities and has written articles for national newspapers related to this . At the 2008 Labour Party Conference , Sarah caused surprise by taking to the stage to introduce her husband for his keynote address . Since then her public profile has increased . 
 Brown has two brothers , John Brown and Andrew Brown . Andrew has been Head of Media Relations in the UK for the French @-@ owned utility company EDF Energy since 2004 . Brown is also the brother @-@ in @-@ law of environmental journalist Clare <unk> Brown . Brown wrote a piece for The Independent supporting Clare 's current environmental efforts on behalf of Sarawak . 
 Whilst Prime Minister , Brown spent some of his spare time at Chequers , the house often being filled with friends . The Browns have entertained local dignitaries like Sir Leonard Figg . Brown is also a friend of Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling , who says of Brown " I know him as affable , funny and gregarious , a great listener , a kind and loyal friend . "

 The son of a Church of Scotland minister , Brown has talked about what he calls his " moral compass " and of his parents being his " inspiration " .

 Speech to 2008 Lambeth Conference 
 On 24 July 2008 , Brown spoke at the “ Walk of Witness ” in support of poverty reduction worldwide during the Lambeth Conference . He called the march " one of the greatest demonstrations of faith this great city has ever seen . " Brown said that " at our current rates of progress , " the MDGs will not be met by the 2015 deadline . He told the Anglican Communion bishops , " I say to you that the poor of the world have been patient but 100 years is too long for people to wait for justice and that is why we must act now . ” The full speech can be read at Gordon Brown Speech to the Walk for Witness Rally 24 July 2008 .

 = Frances Ames = 
 Frances Rix Ames ( 20 April 1920 – 11 November 2002 ) was a South African neurologist , psychiatrist , and human rights activist , best known for leading the medical ethics inquiry into the death of anti @-@ apartheid activist Steve Biko , who died from medical neglect after being tortured in police custody . When the South African Medical and Dental Council ( SAMDC ) declined to discipline the chief district surgeon and his assistant who treated Biko , Ames and a group of five academics and physicians raised funds and fought an eight @-@ year legal battle against the medical establishment . Ames risked her personal safety and academic career in her pursuit of justice , taking the dispute to the South African Supreme Court , where she eventually won the case in 1985 . 
 Born in Pretoria and raised in poverty in Cape Town , Ames became the first woman to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Cape Town in 1964 . Ames studied the effects of cannabis on the brain and published several articles on the subject ; seeing the therapeutic benefits of cannabis on patients in her own hospital , she became an early proponent of legalization for medicinal use . She headed the neurology department at Groote Schuur Hospital before retiring in 1985 , but continued to lecture at Valkenberg and Alexandra Hospital . After apartheid was finally dismantled in 1994 , Ames testified at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission about her work on the " Biko doctors " medical ethics inquiry . In 1999 , Nelson Mandela awarded Ames the Star of South Africa , the country 's highest civilian award , in recognition of her work on behalf of human rights . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ames was born at <unk> in Pretoria , South Africa , on 20 April 1920 , to Frank and Georgina Ames , the second of three daughters . Her mother , who was raised in a Boer concentration camp by Ames ' grandmother , a nurse in the Second Boer War , was also a nurse . Ames never knew her father , who left her mother alone to raise three daughters in poverty . With her mother unable to care for her family , Ames spent part of her childhood in a Catholic orphanage where she was stricken with typhoid fever . Her mother later rejoined the family and moved them to Cape Town , where Ames attended the Rustenburg School for Girls . She enrolled at the University of Cape Town ( UCT ) medical school where she received her <unk> degree in 1942 . 
 = = Medical career = = 
 In Cape Town , Ames interned at Groote Schuur Hospital ; she also worked in the Transkei region as a general practitioner . She earned her MD degree in 1964 from UCT , the first woman to do so . Ames became head of the neurology department at Groote Schuur Hospital in 1976 . She was made an associate professor in 1978 . Ames retired in 1985 , but continued to work part @-@ time at both Valkenberg and Alexandra Hospital as a lecturer in the UCT Psychiatry and Mental Health department . In 1997 , UCT made Ames an associate professor emeritus of neurology ; she received an honorary doctorate in medicine from UCT in 2001 . According to Pat Sidley of the British Medical Journal , Ames " was never made a full professor , and believed that this was because she was a woman . " 
 = = Biko affair = = 
 South African anti @-@ apartheid activist Steve Biko , who had formerly studied medicine at the University of Natal Medical School , was detained by Port Elizabeth security police on 18 August 1977 and held for 20 days . Sometime between 6 – 7 September , Biko was beaten and tortured into a coma . According to allegations by Ames and others , surgeon Ivor Lang , along with chief district surgeon Benjamin Tucker , collaborated with the police and covered up the abuse , leading to Biko 's death from his injuries on 12 September . According to Bentar & Bentar 2012 , " there were clear ethical breaches on the part of the doctors who were responsible " for Biko . 
 When the South African Medical and Dental Council ( SAMDC ) along with the support of the Medical Association of South Africa ( <unk> ) , declined to discipline the district surgeons in Biko 's death , two groups of physicians filed separate formal complaints with the SAMDC regarding the lack of professionalism shown by Biko 's doctors . Both cases made their way to the South African Supreme Court in an attempt to force the SAMDC to conduct a formal inquiry into the medical ethics of Lang and Tucker . One case was filed by Ames , along with Trefor Jenkins and Phillip Tobias of the University of the Witwatersrand ; a second case was filed by Dumisani <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> Hospital , and Tim Wilson of Alexandra Health Centre . 
 As Ames and the small group of physicians pursued an inquiry into members of their own profession , Ames was called a whistleblower . Her position at the university was threatened by her superiors and her colleagues asked her to drop the case . By pursuing the case against the Biko doctors , Ames received personal threats and risked her safety . Baldwin @-@ <unk> et al. note that the medical association " closed ranks in support of colleagues who colluded with the security police in the torture and death of detainees [ and ] also attempted to silence and discredit those doctors who stood up for human rights and who demanded disciplinary action against their colleagues . " 
 After eight years , Ames won the case in 1985 when the South African Supreme Court ruled in her favor . With Ames ' help , the case forced the medical regulatory body to reverse their decision . The two doctors who treated Biko were finally disciplined and major medical reforms followed . According to Bentar & Bentar 2012 , the case " played an important role in sensitising the medical profession to medical ethical issues in South Africa . " 
 = = Cannabis research = = 
 Ames studied the effects of cannabis in 1958 , publishing her work in The British Journal of Psychiatry as " A clinical and metabolic study of acute intoxication with Cannabis sativa and its role in the model psychoses " . Her work is cited extensively throughout the cannabis literature . She opposed the War on Drugs and was a proponent of the therapeutic benefits of cannabis , particularly for people with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Ames observed first @-@ hand how cannabis ( known as <unk> in South Africa ) relieved spasm in MS patients and helped paraplegics in the spinal injuries ward of her hospital . She continued to study the effects of cannabis in the 1990s , publishing several articles about cannabis @-@ induced euphoria and the effects of cannabis on the brain with co @-@ author David J. Castle of St Vincent 's Hospital , Melbourne .

 Ames was married to editorial writer David Castle of the Cape Times and they had four sons . She was 47 years old when her husband died unexpectedly in 1967 . After her husband 's death , Ames 's housekeeper Rosalina helped raise the family . Ames wrote about the experience in her memoir , Mothering in an Apartheid Society ( 2002 ) .

 Ames struggled with leukemia for some time . Before her death , she told an interviewer , " I shall go on until I drop . " She continued to work for UCT as a part @-@ time lecturer at Valkenberg Hospital until six weeks before she died at home in Rondebosch on 11 November 2002 . Representing UCT 's psychiatry department , Greg McCarthy gave the eulogy at the funeral . Ames was cremated , and according to her wishes , her ashes were combined with hemp seed and dispersed outside of Valkenberg Hospital where her memorial service was held . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 South African neurosurgeon Colin Froman referred to Ames as the " great and unorthodox protagonist for the medical use of marijuana many years before the current interest in its use as a therapeutic drug " . J. P. van Niekerk of the South African Medical Journal notes that " Frances Ames led by conviction and example " and history eventually justified her action in the Biko affair . 
 Ames 's work on the Biko affair led to major medical reforms in South Africa , including the disbanding and replacement of the old apartheid @-@ era medical organisations which failed to uphold the medical standards of the profession . According to van Niekerk , " the most enduring lesson for South African medicine was the clarification of the roles of medical practitioners when there is a question of dual responsibilities . This is now embodied inter alia in the SAMA Code of Conduct and in legal interpretations of doctors ' responsibilities " . 
 Ames testified during the medical hearings at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997 . Archbishop Desmond Tutu honored Ames as " one of the handful of doctors who stood up to the apartheid regime and brought to book those doctors who had colluded with human rights abuse . " In acknowledgement of her work on behalf of human rights in South Africa , Nelson Mandela awarded Ames the Order of the Star of South Africa in 1999 , the highest civilian award in the country .

 WrestleMania XXX ( also written as WrestleMania 30 ) was the thirtieth annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view ( PPV ) event produced by WWE . It took place on April 6 , 2014 , at the Mercedes @-@ Benz Superdome in New Orleans , Louisiana . It was the first WWE event simultaneously broadcast live on pay @-@ per @-@ view television and WWE 's new streaming media service , the WWE Network . Seven professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event 's card and one pre @-@ show match was streamed on the WWE Network . 
 Daniel Bryan defeated Triple H in the first match on the main show to qualify for the triple threat main event match , where he defeated Batista and defending champion Randy Orton to become the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion . The event was also notable for The Undertaker 's 21 – 0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania coming to an end with a loss to Brock Lesnar . The WWE Divas Championship was defended for the only time at WrestleMania as the other title defended on the main show while the WWE Tag Team Championship was defended on the pre @-@ show .

 WrestleMania is considered WWE 's flagship event , and has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment . 
 On February 18 , 2013 , WWE announced that WrestleMania XXX would be held at the Mercedes @-@ Benz Superdome in the city of New Orleans on April 6 , 2014 . The event is alternatively known as WrestleMania 30 . On August 12 , travel packages for WrestleMania XXX went on sale , which included tickets to WrestleMania , hotel room accommodation , and other activities including WrestleMania <unk> , the 2014 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony , and the next Raw ; the cheapest package cost $ 795 per person . On November 16 , individual tickets went on sale through Ticketmaster , with prices ranging from $ 25 to $ 850 . While ordering WrestleMania through pay @-@ per @-@ view television costs between $ 55 – $ 70 , WWE has also made WrestleMania XXX available live through its new WWE Network online streaming service , which costs $ 9 @.@ 99 per month with a six @-@ month contract ; WrestleMania was the first event available simultaneously on pay @-@ per @-@ view and on the WWE Network . 
 The event was the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Louisiana . There are three official theme songs for the event , " Celebrate " by Kid Rock , " Legacy " by Eminem , and " In Time " by Mark Collie . A promotional poster for the event was released through pay @-@ per @-@ view providers such as In Demand , with the tagline laissez les bons temps <unk> . The WrestleMania set was built by a crew of roughly 400 workers over two weeks , assembling equipment carried by 85 semi @-@ trailer trucks . 
 After the Royal Rumble event in late January 2014 , CM Punk reportedly legitimately walked out on WWE while still under contract and WWE stopped promoting him for future events ; which Professional Wrestling Torch editor Wade Keller analysed as playing a part in Daniel Bryan 's WrestleMania journey . In May 2014 , Bryan revealed in an interview that he also believed that WWE decided to give him the big WrestleMania spotlight only after Punk quit . 
 Daniel Bryan entered the event as the bookmakers ' favourite to walk out of WrestleMania as champion , while the biggest favourite to earn a victory was the Undertaker , which Forbes endorsed as " as close to a sure thing as you ’ re going to find " . 
 = = = Storylines = = = 
 The professional wrestling matches at WrestleMania XXX featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre @-@ determined by the hosting promotion , WWE . Storylines between the characters played out on WWE 's primary television programs , Raw and SmackDown . 
 Daniel Bryan 's eight @-@ month road to WrestleMania began at SummerSlam in August 2013 , when he started feuding with Triple H and Randy Orton . Since June , Bryan had been praised as one of the top performers in WWE by critics and veterans of the professional wrestling industry , as his rise in status led him to a title shot at SummerSlam . At the event , Bryan defeated John Cena to win his first WWE Championship with Triple H as the special guest referee . After the match , Triple H turned heel by attacking Bryan , which directly led to Orton using his Money in the Bank title opportunity for an immediate title shot . Orton pinned a downed Bryan to capture the WWE Championship . After SummerSlam , Triple H claimed that it was a " business decision " to sabotage Bryan because Bryan did not fit the type of wrestler that the company was looking for as its champion ; therefore , Triple H and Stephanie McMahon ( later known as the Authority ) instead endorsed Orton as the " face of the WWE " . Over the next few months , Bryan was constantly sabotaged in his attempts to gain and hold on to the WWE Championship . Bryan defeated Orton to regain the WWE Championship at Night of Champions , but due to referee Scott Armstrong making a fast count , Triple H stripped Bryan of the title the next night on Raw . At Battleground , a match between Bryan and Orton for the vacant title ended in a no contest when Big Show ( who had been manipulated by the Authority in the weeks prior ) attacked both men . Bryan once again challenged Orton for the vacant championship at Hell in a Cell ; Triple H interfered in the match and was attacked by Bryan , resulting in special guest referee Shawn Michaels attacking Bryan , which led to Orton capturing the WWE Championship again . 
 At TLC , WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena to unify the two titles into the new WWE World Heavyweight Championship . In January 2014 , Batista returned to WWE after having left in May 2010 , and promptly won the 2014 Royal Rumble match for a slot in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX . Batista 's win and Daniel Bryan 's lack of participation in the Royal Rumble match was heavily booed by the live crowd at the event . At Elimination Chamber , Randy Orton successfully defended his championship in the Elimination Chamber match to set up Orton versus Batista ( who still received a negative fan reaction at Elimination Chamber when he defeated Alberto Del Rio ) for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX . Daniel Bryan also participated in the Elimination Chamber match , but was the last wrestler eliminated due to interference by Director of Operations Kane , who was affiliated with the Authority . 
 Frustrated over being constantly cost the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by the Authority , Bryan challenged Triple H to a match at WrestleMania XXX . When Triple H refused Bryan 's challenge , Bryan brought a large group of fans on the March 10 episode of Raw to " occupy " the ring and refused to leave . An irate Triple H agreed to Bryan 's demand for a WrestleMania match with the stipulation that if Bryan won , he would be inserted into the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at the event . On the March 17 episode of Raw , Triple H voiced his frustrations over Orton and Batista , then changed the stipulation of his own match , guaranteeing that the winner between him and Bryan would be added to the WWE World Heavyweight championship match , thus assuring a triple threat match for the title . 
 On the February 24 episode of Raw , Brock Lesnar and his manager Paul Heyman voiced their complaints about Lesnar not being in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania . Instead , the Authority offered Lesnar a contract to face anyone else at WrestleMania . They were interrupted by a returning Undertaker , who confronted Lesnar . While Lesnar signed the contract for a match at WrestleMania with The Undertaker as his opponent , The Undertaker accepted Lesnar 's challenge by stabbing Lesnar with a pen and chokeslamming him through a table . This set up a match where Lesnar would attempt to break the Undertaker 's 21 – 0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania . 
 At the Royal Rumble event , The Wyatt Family , led by Bray Wyatt , cost John Cena his match against Randy Orton for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship . At the Elimination Chamber event , the Wyatt Family attacked Cena during his Elimination Chamber match for the same championship , which directly led to Cena 's elimination from the match . Wyatt was motivated by a desire to end " this era of lies " , beginning with Cena , because he wanted to expose to the world that Cena being an upholder of all that is moral and good and right was merely a hollow illusion . Proving that Cena was a fraud would ruin his legacy , but Wyatt wanted to take it one step further by turning Cena into a monster . On the March 10 episode of Raw , Cena issued Wyatt a challenge for a match at WrestleMania , which Wyatt accepted .

The match was changed to an elimination style match shortly before it got underway . Five minutes into the match , Swagger forced Fernando to submit to his signature Patriot Lock to eliminate Los Matadores , followed by Cesaro hitting a European uppercut after throwing Ryback in the air then delivering his signature <unk> to pin Ryback and eliminate RybAxel at the eleven @-@ minute mark . Later , after Jey Uso threw Cesaro into Swagger , Jimmy Uso tagged in and the Usos landed a double superkick and then a double top rope diving splash on Cesaro to win the match and retain the titles . Swagger blamed Cesaro for the loss and put Cesaro in the Patriot Lock . Colter demanded that they put their differences aside , but Cesaro put Swagger in the giant swing and then walked off .

 = = = Preliminary matches = = = 
 The pay @-@ per @-@ view event started when host Hulk Hogan came down to the ring for a segment , at one point accidentally calling the Superdome the " Silverdome " . A few moments later , Stone Cold Steve Austin joined him in the ring , teasing a confrontation between the two . After that , The Rock also came down to the ring . The three reminisced about past WrestleManias and led the crowd in their signature chants and catchphrases . They then shared a number of beers together before departing the ring . 
 In the first match on the pay @-@ per @-@ view portion of the show , Daniel Bryan faced Triple H ; the winner would be inserted in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship main event later that night . Triple H was announced and accompanied by Stephanie McMahon . Bryan kicked away Triple H 's handshake and started the match strongly , including performing a tornado DDT off the apron . Triple H gained the advantage by driving Bryan 's injured arm into the announce table and continually attacking the arm including a hammerlock belly @-@ to @-@ back suplex on the apron . Bryan refused to submit to Triple H 's submission holds of the crossface chickenwing and a regular crossface , instead reversing to his signature Yes ! Lock , but Triple H reached the ropes to break the hold . Triple H countered Bryan 's signature running knee with a spinebuster and his signature Pedigree maneuver , but Bryan kicked out at two . After another series of counters , Bryan hit his running knee for the three count and the win . After the match , McMahon slapped Bryan , distracting him long enough for Triple H to attack him from behind . Triple H placed Bryan 's injured arm against the ring post and hit it with a steel folding chair . Bryan had to be attended to by medical staff while Triple H and McMahon celebrated on the stage . 
 The second match saw The New Age Outlaws ( Road Dogg and Billy Gunn ) and Kane take on The Shield ( Dean Ambrose , Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns ) . Ambrose was the reigning WWE United States Champion . The pace of the match was quick ; the end of the match saw Kane being hit by Reigns ' signature spear , and Reigns then hit both Outlaws simultaneously with another spear . The Shield then performed their Triple Powerbomb maneuver on both Outlaws for a decisive victory . 
 The third match was the battle royal for the André the Giant Memorial Trophy . Brodus Clay was eliminated by The Great Khali , followed by Khali himself by the three members of <unk> , who were all eliminated by Mark Henry , who was in turn eliminated by Big Show . Fandango eliminated WWE Intercontinental Champion Big E and showboated on the ring apron , so Sheamus delivered over 20 forearm clubs to Fandango 's chest and eliminated him . Cesaro , an unannounced entrant who had wrestled on the pre @-@ show , eliminated Rey Mysterio with a European uppercut and then threw Kofi Kingston out of the ring , but Kingston survived because his feet landed on the ring steps . Kingston returned to the match but Sheamus later eliminated him . Alberto Del Rio , who had earlier eliminated Goldust and Cody Rhodes , eliminated Dolph Ziggler to leave himself , Sheamus , Cesaro and Big Show as the final four men . Del Rio and Sheamus eliminated each other , leaving Cesaro and Show to fight back and forth until Cesaro lifted Show and body slammed him out of the ring to become the victor , mirroring Hulk Hogan 's momentous body slam of André the Giant at WrestleMania III . 
 The next match was between John Cena and Bray Wyatt . The Wyatt Family 's entrance was voodoo @-@ themed and performed live by a costumed Mark <unk> and the <unk> . Wyatt started the match by kneeling down and telling Cena to be the monster that he is and to finish him off ; Cena refused . Wyatt continued taunts led to an enraged Cena 's aggressive retaliation , but Wyatt just laughed while taking punishment . Cena managed to collect himself and reverted to his normal self , attempting his signature Five Knuckle Shuffle when suddenly Wyatt responded with a ' crab pose ' that shocked Cena into retreating . Wyatt later hit a DDT on the apron , but it was not enough to beat Cena . Cena climbed to the top rope , but instead of attacking Wyatt , Cena dove onto Wyatt 's henchmen Harper and Rowan at ringside . Cena teased becoming a ' monster ' again by preparing to smash Wyatt with the steel ring steps , but he could not do it and threw them away . Wyatt took too much time when he held Cena while singing " He 's Got the Whole World in His Hands " , so Cena hit his signature Attitude Adjustment maneuver but Wyatt kicked out . At ringside , Cena tackled Harper through the guardrail at the timekeeper 's area . Back in the ring , Cena put Wyatt in his signature STF submission , but Wyatt reached the ropes . Wyatt followed with his signature Sister Abigail for a near fall . Wyatt introduced a steel folding chair into the ring by tossing it to Cena , again begging Cena to use it on him and thereby ruin his own legacy . Cena instead smashed Rowan ( who had gotten on the ring apron ) with the chair , so Wyatt capitalized by rolling him up for another near fall . Cena countered another Sister Abigail attempt and hit another Attitude Adjustment for the win . 
 In the next match , Brock Lesnar faced the Undertaker with Undertaker 's streak of victories at WrestleMania on the line . The match was a slow one with Undertaker looking old and worn down throughout . Lesnar survived a chokeslam while Undertaker did not succumb to Lesnar 's signature F5 maneuver . Undertaker twice trapped Lesnar in his Hell 's Gate submission , but both times Lesnar broke the hold by lifting Undertaker up and powerbombing him . Lesnar and Undertaker then traded locking each other in the kimura submission , but neither submitted . Lesnar then countered an Old School attempt by Undertaker into another F5 , but Undertaker kicked out . Undertaker responded with a Last Ride powerbomb , then a Tombstone Piledriver into a pin , but Lesnar kicked out at two . As Undertaker attempted a second Tombstone Piledriver , Lesnar countered into a third F5 and pinned Undertaker for the victory , ending the Undertaker 's undefeated streak at WrestleMania as Lesnar 's manager Paul Heyman " freaked out " at the result . WWE did not play Lesnar 's theme music immediately after his victory , highlighting the reaction of a shocked and stunned crowd , just before Justin Roberts announced Lesnar as the winner . Instead , WWE showed a graphic displaying the Undertaker 's WrestleMania record of " 21 @-@ 1 " . The crowd eventually booed Lesnar as he left . Undertaker was left in the ring , where he gathered himself . As he slowly walked up the entrance ramp , WWE 's announcers gave him a standing ovation and the crowd chanted his name and various " thank you " chants . 
 The seventh match was the 14 @-@ Diva single @-@ fall Vickie Guerrero Divas Championship Invitational for the WWE Divas Championship ; this marked the first time the title was defended at WrestleMania . The match started with the other wrestlers attacking champion AJ Lee and her bodyguard , Tamina Snuka . As the match progressed , Aksana met Naomi at the top rope and Natalya slipped under Aksana to perform a powerbomb superplex combination . Tamina pulled Aksana out of the ring to prevent Natalya from winning , so Natalya clotheslined Tamina on the outside but was prevented from re @-@ entering the ring due to AJ kicking her . AJ applied her signature Black Widow hold on Naomi and won the match , thus retaining her title . WWE reported that AJ won by moving Naomi 's hand unto the mat to deceive the referee into thinking that Naomi had submitted .

 In the main event of the night , Daniel Bryan , Batista and Randy Orton faced off in a triple threat match for Orton 's WWE World Heavyweight Championship . Orton 's entrance included a live performance by Rev Theory . Orton started by targeting Bryan 's injured arm to momentarily neutralize him . With no count @-@ outs in a triple threat match , Batista and Orton battled at ringside ; Batista tried for his signature Batista Bomb onto the steel ring steps , but Orton countered with a back body drop onto the steps . After Orton and Batista returned to the ring , Bryan made a comeback with a missile dropkick to both men , then peppered his opponents ' chests with roundhouse kicks . Bryan then served consecutive corner dropkicks to Orton and Batista , but then was suplexed from the ring to the outside by Batista . Batista and Orton fought again with Orton executing a superplex , but then Bryan immediately returned with a diving headbutt and applied his signature Yes ! Lock on Orton . 
 With Orton trapped in Bryan 's submission hold , Triple H and Stephanie McMahon emerged from backstage and pulled the original referee out of the ring to prevent the match from ending . Triple H then sent in referee Scott Armstrong on his behalf , as Batista performed the Batista Bomb on a distracted Bryan . Armstrong made the count , but Bryan kicked out at two . A charging Batista was sent into the ring post when Bryan dodged . With no disqualifications in a triple threat match , Bryan kicked referee Armstrong in the head , following with a suicide dive out of the ring onto Triple H , Stephanie McMahon and Armstrong . Triple H tried to retaliate with a sledgehammer , but Bryan snatched it and used the sledgehammer on Triple H , knocking him off the ring apron . This ended Triple H and Stephanie McMahon 's interference in the match . 
 Batista and Orton decided to work together to assault Bryan , and the original referee returned to the match . At ringside , Batista threw Bryan down with a Batista Bomb onto the Spanish announce table , while Orton immediately combined with an inverted version of his signature RKO maneuver . As both Bryan and Orton were sent through the Spanish announce table , only Batista emerged unscathed . Medical personnel arrived and carted Bryan away on a stretcher . Batista attacked Orton , who retaliated with a DDT onto the floor . Suddenly , Bryan got off the stretcher and crawled back to the ring , where he was set upon by Orton . 
 Orton attempted to hit Bryan with an RKO but Bryan countered into a Yes ! Lock . Batista broke the hold but was instead trapped by Bryan in the Yes ! Lock , which Orton broke up . Batista avoided an RKO , then Orton leapfrogged Batista 's spear so that Bryan received it and was sent out of the ring . Orton finally landed an RKO on Batista , who barely kicked out before three . Orton measured Batista for a punt kick , but instead received a signature running knee from Bryan . However , Batista threw Bryan out of the ring and covered Orton instead , which resulted in a near fall as Orton kicked out . A frustrated Batista followed up with a Batista Bomb on Orton , but Bryan came out of nowhere with a running knee on Batista . Bryan then trapped Batista in the Yes ! Lock ; Batista fought the hold but eventually had to submit , giving the victory and the WWE World Heavyweight Championship for Bryan . The show ended with Bryan 's celebrations , including fireworks , confetti and Bryan leading the crowd in a " Yes ! " chant .

 Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter summed up WrestleMania XXX as a " very newsworthy show to say the least " . Daniel Bryan 's first match was described as a long technical one , and although Meltzer did not consider it " a match of the year or probably even the week " , it " was the caliber of a good PPV main event " . Triple H 's post @-@ match attack on Bryan was said to be a " very basic " storyline " but it 's also exactly what they should have done " . Bryan 's second match in the main event was described as " really great " with lots of twists and turns , while the match result was " again exactly what they should have done " and " the crowd reacted the way you would expect " . Meltzer thought that " the people just weren 't into " the Undertaker 's match as " nobody bought that Lesnar could win " . Meanwhile , he felt that the Undertaker 's departure was " certainly teased like a retirement " . For the battle royal , Meltzer noted the lack of ( surprise ) entrants such as Rob Van Dam , Alexander Rusev , Christian or Wade Barrett . In other notes , Meltzer described the strong fan support for Cesaro and also labelled Cena 's win as a " genuine upset " . 
 Justin LaBar of the Pittsburgh Tribune @-@ Review summed up WrestleMania XXX as " shocking " , but " one of the best " . LaBar commented that he was " bored " with the Undertaker 's match , just waiting for the final stretch as " Undertaker was going to win anyway " . When Lesnar won , LaBar said that he had " never been part of a more real and emotionally driven moment " . LaBar also commented that " Antonio Cesaro is here to stay " and described WWE as " the ultimate puppet master " because " Daniel Bryan finally wins the world title and it still isn 't the top story from that event . " 
 Benjamin Tucker of the Professional Wrestling Torch Newsletter attended the event , and he scored the event 8 @.@ 75 out of 10 . He stated , that WrestleMania XXX " served as an event meant to respect the past while looking forward to the future " just like WrestleMania XX , with wrestlers like Bryan and Cesaro " spotlighted as the future of WWE " . However , Tucker noted that " saying goodbye to the past proved harder than anyone could imagine " with the end of the Undertaker 's Streak . He said this , and not WrestleMania 28 , was the true " End of an Era " but Tucker did not " think it could have ended on a worse note " with over 15 minutes of " slow , subpar action " . Tucker commented that the lack of hype before the event of the Streak being in jeopardy made it less of a defining moment when Lesnar broke it and more of " an indictment on whoever okay 'ed the decision to let this happen " . However , " Bryan was there to save the day " with two well executed matches , making those in " attendance momentarily forget about Taker and root for the underdog who was finally getting his chance to shine " . Tucker praised the booking of the match as perfect with its numerous false finishes . 
 For the rest of the event , Tucker commented that Wyatt " lost nothing by losing , but Cena certainly lost a lot by winning . The man shows no weakness " . Tucker also noted that the segment involving Hogan , Austin and the Rock was " meaningless , surreal and a lot of fun " . Tucker concluded by saying that the event was " easily one of the best <unk> of the last ten years " and that " the future certainly does look bright . If only we could have said our good @-@ byes properly " . 
 Reflecting in March 2016 just before WrestleMania 32 , Luke Winkie of Sports Illustrated wrote that the WrestleMania XXX resulted in " pure , cathartic , we @-@ have @-@ this @-@ moment forever joy " .

 The Ultimate Warrior 's first WrestleMania appearance since WrestleMania XII , headlining the unveiling of the 2014 Hall of Famers , would be his last . On April 8 , the day after making his last public appearance on Raw to speak to the fans , Warrior suddenly collapsed and died at age 54 in Arizona . WWE paid tribute to Warrior on the April 14 episode of Raw . 
 WWE held an online charity auction centered around WrestleMania XXX from March 31 to April 8 , 2014 . It raised over $ 400 @,@ 000 for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees 's " The Brees Dream Foundation " . 
 The Undertaker was reportedly taken away from the Superdome in an ambulance , which WWE later confirmed was due to him suffering a " severe concussion " ; he was discharged the next day . In May 2014 , Shawn Michaels said that Vince McMahon made the final decision to end the Undertaker 's streak about four hours before WrestleMania XXX . McMahon confirmed in December 2014 that it was indeed him who made the final decision and that the Undertaker was initially shocked at the decision . The decision was made due to McMahon believing that it would make a huge deal out of Brock Lesnar to set up the next WrestleMania event . McMahon also said that he did not foresee other viable candidates on the roster to fill Lesnar 's role within the near future .

 During the post @-@ WrestleMania Raw on April 7 , Triple H immediately used his authority as WWE COO to grant himself a title match against WWE World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan later that night . As Stephanie McMahon tried to persuade Randy Orton , Batista , Kane , and the Shield to help Triple H in his title match , Kane inadvertently revealed that Triple H was the mastermind behind the attack on the Shield on the previous month 's SmackDown . As a result , Bryan was attacked by Orton , Batista , and Kane just before his title match , which began anyway at the order of Triple H. However , the title match ended in a no contest and Bryan 's retention when the Shield interfered , attacking and chasing away Triple H , Orton , Batista , and Kane . 
 The following week , Triple H , Orton and Batista reformed Evolution to take on the Shield . Meanwhile , Stephanie McMahon enticed Kane to return to his masked self ; Kane complied and was granted a future title match against Bryan , and proceeded to carry out attacks against Bryan and his wife , Brie Bella .

Later that night , Seth Rollins turned on his Shield team @-@ mates and allied himself with Triple H 's Authority , eventually winning the Money in the Bank briefcase . The remaining members of the Shield , Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns , went their separate ways by the end of June . Cesaro ended his association with Paul Heyman in July on the night of Brock Lesnar 's return . By that time , Cesaro had failed to win title matches for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship , the Intercontinental Championship and the United States Championship . 
 At Night of Champions in September 2014 , the Usos ' tag title reign ended at the hands of Gold and Stardust . Also at the event , AJ Lee became a three @-@ time Divas Champion by capturing the title from Paige . Paige and AJ had exchanged the Divas Championship several times after WrestleMania , firstly on the June 30 episode of Raw and secondly at SummerSlam .

In other matches , Daniel Bryan wrestled in the pay @-@ per @-@ view opener , a seven @-@ man ladder match , and won the Intercontinental Championship from Bad News Barrett . Next , Rollins lost a singles match to Randy Orton . Then , Triple H defeated Sting in another singles match . A tag match followed where AJ Lee teamed with Paige to defeat Nikki Bella and Brie Bella . Next , Cena scored another WrestleMania victory , this time at the expense of Rusev , while Cena captured the United States Championship . In the penultimate match , the Undertaker ( in his return to TV ) defeated Bray Wyatt . On the pre @-@ show , Cesaro and Tyson Kidd successfully defended the tag titles , while Big Show won the second Andre the Giant memorial battle royal . 
 The Undertaker reignited his feud with Brock Lesnar at Battleground by causing a no contest for his WWE World Heavyweight Championship match against Seth Rollins and then proceeded to controversially defeat Lesnar in a rematch at SummerSlam . The feud ended at the 2015 Hell in a Cell event with Lesnar defeating Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match .

 = 1917 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1917 Atlantic hurricane season featured nine known tropical cyclones , four of which made landfall . The first system appeared on July 6 east of the Windward Islands . After crossing the islands and traversing the Caribbean Sea , the storm struck Honduras , Belize , and Mexico , before dissipating on July 14 . After more than three weeks without tropical cyclogenesis , another tropical storm developed west of Bermuda . As the storm brushed eastern New England , four ships sank near Nantucket , causing 41 fatalities . The same cyclone brought damaging winds to Nova Scotia before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August 10 . 
 A hurricane developed over the central Atlantic Ocean on August 30 and ultimately affected Bermuda with heightened tides as it passed to the east . Elsewhere , the hurricane had little impact , becoming extratropical on September 5 . After the third system , a series of four tropical depressions formed , but failed to become severe . The fourth hurricane brought devastation to Jamaica , Cuba , and portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States , especially western parts of the Florida Panhandle . Overall , the storm left six deaths and inflicted at least $ 170 @,@ 000 ( 1917 USD ) in damage . 
 The season 's activity can be quantified in an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 61 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed ; therefore , storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACE ratings .

After peaking with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) on July 8 , it began to weaken and fell to tropical depression intensity early on July 10 . Early the next day , the depression struck Honduras , before briefly emerging into the Caribbean Sea . The system struck Belize around 06 : 00 UTC on July 12 and entered the Bay of Campeche about 24 hours later . At midday on July 14 , the storm struck south of Tampico , Tamaulipas .

The storm strengthened further and attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) early on August 10 ; both were observations from the Nantucket Shoals Lightship . Offshore the island of Nantucket in Massachusetts , four ships were lost , with an estimated 41 people perishing . The storm continued northeastward and made landfall in Saint John County , New Brunswick while becoming extratropical at 00 : 00 UTC on August 11 . The remnants dissipated over the Labrador Sea later that day . In Nova Scotia , dozens of boats were beached . Wind speeds up to 64 mph ( 103 km / h ) in Yarmouth damaged trees , power lines , windows , and roofs . Crops were impacted throughout the Annapolis Valley .

Moving west @-@ northwestward , the tropical storm reached Category 1 hurricane intensity early on August 31 . By late on September 1 , the storm had intensified into a Category 2 hurricane . Further strengthening occurred brought the hurricane to a Category 3 intensity late on September 3 , while briefly heading northward . Early the next day , the cyclone attained its peak force with winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) ; the lowest barometric pressure reading in association with the storm was 980 mbar ( 29 inHg ) . 
 While passing east of Bermuda late on September 4 , the storm 's " unprecedented high tides " lashed the island . Portions of Market Square on St. David 's Island were submerged . Additionally , a large section of Higgs ' Island was completed washed away . The storm accelerated to the northeast and weakened to a Category 2 hurricane around 12 : 00 UTC on September 5 . Losing tropical characteristics , the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 00 : 00 UTC the following day , while located about 290 mi ( 470 km ) southeast of Cape Race , Newfoundland . Its remnants tracked northeastward until dissipating near Iceland on September 7 .

 A tropical storm formed about 160 mi ( 260 km ) east @-@ northeast of Barbados on September 20 . Later that day , the storm crossed the Lesser Antilles between the islands of Saint Lucia and Martinique . Upon entering the Caribbean Sea on September 21 , the system intensified quicker , becoming a Category 1 hurricane several hours later . While passing south of the Tiburon Peninsula on the following day , the storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane . Later on September 23 , the hurricane struck the northern coast of Jamaica , before re @-@ emerging into the Caribbean Sea . Around 06 : 00 UTC on September 24 , it intensified into a Category 3 hurricane . Approximately 24 hours later , the hurricane deepened into a Category 4 hurricane . 
 Ramón Perez of the Instituto de Meteorología de la República de Cuba estimated that this hurricane attained a minimum barometric pressure of 928 mbar ( 27 @.@ 4 inHg ) on September 25 . Using the pressure @-@ wind relationship , HURDAT increased the maximum sustained wind speed to 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . Within the next six hours , the hurricane made landfall in the eastern Pinar del Río Province of Cuba . The system entered the Gulf of Mexico later on September 25 . While moving northwestward , the storm fell to Category 3 hurricane intensity early on September 27 . It briefly tracked generally northward and approached southeastern Louisiana before re @-@ curving northeastward late the next day . At 02 : 00 UTC on September 29 , the hurricane made landfall near Fort Walton Beach , Florida with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . Shortly thereafter , the system rapidly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane and fell to a tropical storm several hours later . Early on September 30 , it became extratropical over Georgia . About six hours later , the remnants of the hurricane dissipated . 
 Some islands in the Lesser Antilles experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall , including Dominica , Guadeloupe , and Saint Lucia . In Jamaica , the hurricane caused significant damages to banana and coconut plantations . Communications from Holland Bay were disrupted when the station was demolished . The greatest damages were reported from the northern half of the island . In Nueva Gerona , strong winds destroyed well @-@ constructed buildings , devastating the town . Orchards and crops were destroyed on the Pinar del Río Province . In Louisiana and Mississippi , impact was generally limited to damaged crops and timber stands . One death from drowning was reported in Louisiana . Farther east in Mobile , Alabama , portions of roofs , trees , and other debris littered streets . Communications were severed in Pensacola , Florida . Several small <unk> washed ashore , and numerous wharves , docks , and boat storages suffered impact . Total damages were estimated near $ 170 @,@ 000 in Pensacola area . Five deaths were reported in Florida , all of them in the city of Crestview .

 In addition to the four systems reaching tropical storm intensity , there were five other tropical depressions . The first probably developed from a tropical wave offshore western Africa on September 12 , according to historical weather maps and the Comprehensive Ocean @-@ Atmosphere Data Set ( <unk> ) , both of which indicated a closed circulation . This depression was last observed on September 14 . Another depression also developed on September 12 , well to the east of the Lesser Antilles . While approaching the islands , the storm may have briefly strengthened into a tropical storm on September 15 , as suggested by a ship report of winds blowing 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . The cyclone likely dissipated on September 15 . 
 The next tropical depression briefly existed off the east coast of Florida on September 14 . It soon became extratropical , though its remnants lasted several days , traveling along the East Coast of the United States . At Nantucket , a wind gust up to 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) was observed . The extratropical remnants probably dissipated near Newfoundland on September 20 . Meanwhile , a trough in the Gulf of Mexico had developed into a tropical depression on September 14 . The following day , the system made landfall in Louisiana and disintegrated into a disorganized area of thunderstorms over Mississippi and Arkansas on September 16 . The last tropical depression and final cyclone of the season developed on October 19 from a trough over the central Atlantic Ocean . Two days later , the depression was absorbed by a cold front .

 Static Shock is an American animated television series based on the Milestone Media / DC Comics superhero Static . It premiered on September 23 , 2000 , on The WB Television Network 's Kids ' WB ! block programming . Static Shock ran for four seasons , with 52 half @-@ hour episodes in total . The show revolves around Virgil Hawkins , an African @-@ American boy who uses the secret identity of Static after exposure to a mutagen gas during a gang fight gave him electromagnetic powers . Part of the DC animated universe , the series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation from a crew composed mostly of people from the company 's past shows but also with the involvement of two of the comic 's creators , Dwayne McDuffie and Denys Cowan . 
 Static Shock had some alterations from the original comic book because it was oriented to a pre @-@ teen audience . Nevertheless , the show approached several social issues , which was positively received by most television critics . Static Shock was nominated for numerous awards , including the Daytime Emmy . Some criticism was directed towards its jokes — which were said to be stale and too similar to Spider @-@ Man style — and animation , which was said to be unnatural and <unk> . The series also produced some related merchandise , which sold poorly ; McDuffie cited the low sales as one of the main factors behind the series ' cancellation . In spite of it , its popularity revived interest in the original Milestone comic and inserted McDuffie in the animation industry . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Virgil Hawkins is a fourteen @-@ year @-@ old African American who lives with his older sister Sharon and his widowed father Robert in Dakota City . He attends high school with his best friend Richie Foley , and has a crush on a girl named Frieda . He also has a dispute with a bully named Francis , nicknamed " F @-@ Stop . " A gang leader named Wade recently helped Virgil , hoping to recruit him , but Virgil is hesitant , as he knows his mother died in an exchange of gunfire between gangs . Wade eventually leads Virgil to a restricted area for a fight against F @-@ Stop 's crew , but it was interrupted by police helicopters . During the dispute with the police , chemical containers explode , releasing a gas that causes mutations among the people in the vicinity ( This event was later known as " The Big Bang " ) . As a result , Virgil obtains the ability to create , generate , absorb , and control electricity and magnetism — he takes up the alter @-@ ego of " Static " . The gas also gives others in the area their own powers , and several of them become supervillains . The mutated people become meta @-@ humans known as " Bang Babies " , and their mutations apparently spread to other people around them .

 Virgil Ovid Hawkins / Static ( Phil LaMarr ) – A high school student in Dakota City . As a result of accidental exposure to an experimental mutagen in an event known as the Big Bang , he gained the ability to control and manipulate electromagnetism , and uses these powers to become a superhero named " Static . " Countless others who were also exposed also gained a wide variety of mutations and abilities , and Static spends much of his time dealing with these " Bang Babies " , many of whom use their abilities in selfish , harmful , and even criminal ways . 
 Richard " Richie " Osgood Foley / Gear ( voiced by Jason Marsden ) – Virgil 's best friend and confidant . At first , he merely provides support for his friend , making gadgets for him and helping to cover for Virgil to protect his secret identity . In the third season , it is revealed Richie 's passive exposure to the Bang Gas gave him enhanced intelligence , which enabled him to easily invent rocket @-@ powered boots and " Backpack " , a highly intelligent multipurpose device worn on the back capable of surveillance and other semi @-@ independent activity . With this equipment , he adopted the superhero identity " Gear " and becomes Static 's full @-@ time partner in crime @-@ fighting . 
 Robert Hawkins ( Kevin Michael Richardson ) – A social worker who runs the Freeman Community Center as head counselor . He is a widower and the single father of two teenagers — Virgil and Sharon . He dislikes gangs and the destructive attitudes of most Bang Babies , and his work at the community center is motivated by a desire to counteract their bad influence on young people . 
 Sharon Hawkins ( Michele Morgan ) – Virgil 's older sister , Sharon attends college , but she still lives at home . She volunteers at a hospital , and counsels young people at the Freeman Community Center . While they do argue frequently , Sharon and Virgil really do care about each other and are quick to come to the other 's defense if one of them is in danger . After their mother died , Sharon took it upon herself to act as the woman of the house after , mostly when it comes to doling out chores between her and her brother and the cooking ( which , at least according to Virgil , Sharon is not good at ) . 
 Adam Evans / Rubber @-@ Band Man ( voiced by Kadeem Hardison ) – A meta @-@ human whose body structure consists of <unk> rubber . He is the younger brother of Static 's archenemy , Ebon . Rubber @-@ Band Man first appears a tragic villain when he goes after an opportunistic record producer who stole one of his songs . He subsequently breaks out of prison but decides not to pursue a criminal career , however . He and Sharon eventually start dating , with Sharon helping Adam turn over a new leaf . He and Virgil initially clash , but Virgil comes to accept Adam 's relationship with his sister and they become allies in crime @-@ fighting , with Adam even becoming like an older @-@ brother figure to Virgil . 
 Ivan Evans / Ebon ( voiced by Gary Sturgis ) – The head of a large group of Bang Babies called " The Meta @-@ Breed " and the series ' main villain . Ebon is an unusually powerful and strong meta @-@ human ; a living shadow and inter @-@ dimensional portal able to hide within , control and manipulate pure darkness and shadows , as well as transport others to various locations of his choice . 
 = = Production = = 
 The series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation based on the Milestone Media / DC Comics character Static . Its supervising producer was Alan Burnett and Scott <unk> was the main producer under the executive production of Jean MacCurdy and Sander Schwartz . The production team was mostly composed by people who were involved with Batman : The Animated Series and Superman : The Animated Series , but also included Static 's co @-@ creator Denys Cowan . Although the show hired the comic series creator Dwayne McDuffie as story editor and writer , McDuffie had no direct involvement on the development of Static Shock . The idea of a Static cartoon first emerged with DC 's editor @-@ in @-@ chief Jenette Kahn during the time McDuffie was working for Milestone under Kahn . She proposed to adapt some of Milestone comics ; in 1993 , Burnett was hired to write a pilot episode for a X @-@ Men @-@ esque series with Milestone superheroes called The New Guard . After <unk> on producing several other Milestone projects , Static was eventually the series " they went for " . By the time Milestone and DC drafted their contract over DC distributing Milestone comics , the characters were from separate fictional universes . However , when crossovers between Static Shock and other DC animated series were suggested , it was established that they were from the same DC animated universe — " rather than having to muck around with multiple dimensions , or whatever . " 
 Although McDuffie stressed that the show remains loyal to " the spirit and the tone " of the comic book , some changes were done because of its timeslot and target audience of pre @-@ teens . For example , guns appeared less frequently , Richie is not portrayed as a homosexual , and he is Virgil 's confidant instead of Frieda . Virgil is also younger in the animated series , his costumes and use of his powers are different than the original , and his mother is dead in the show despite she is alive in the comics . The latter change was done because producers had the intention " to focus on a strong , complex relationship between an African @-@ American father and son . " Nevertheless , McDuffie was concerned by the change because he originally intended to oppose the stereotype of black people not having a complete nuclear family . However , McDuffie said " that [ it ] worked out okay " as the crew could use the absence of Virgil 's mother to create a " couple of great stories " . Virgil 's father , Robert , " for all intents and purposes , is a new character " , as he was reconceptualized as a social worker . The same goes for Richie , who is described as an amalgam of different characters from the original comic . For the villains , <unk> was reused from the Static comics , Edwin Alva was brought from another Milestone 's series — Hardware — , and the group Meta @-@ Breed was created for the TV series . 
 The third season of the show saw some of the biggest changes ; in addition of Richie 's superhero powers and a new opening , Static changed his costume . Cowan stated that the change was done to give his clothes a " feel of the comic book " , while McDuffie said it represented a growth that Virgil was passing through . This maturation made possible to " explore some of the darker places in his world , " to have more varied conflicts , as the villains have also become more mature . He described it is as " a natural outgrowth of all that , as is the new , more naturalistic look of the show . " This change was followed by the second season premiere — " The Big Leagues " — when Static meets Batman and Robin . Burnett said , " after that show , everybody went , ' Let 's go in that direction . ' " Writer John Semper , Jr. commented , " of course , I always lean toward the dramatic ... But the same old light @-@ hearted Static spirit is still there . " Richie gains superhero powers because it was becoming hard to fit him into the story and the producers wanted to keep the " chemistry " between voice actors LaMarr and Marsden . There was also a positive response from children in focus groups so " [ t ] he answer seemed pretty obvious . " 
 The series ' music director was Richard Wolf , while he , Stanley Clarke and Max <unk> were the composers , and Kennard Ramsey was the orchestrator . For action sequences , Wolf wanted to use " real adrenaline @-@ pumping beat " of 125 beats per minute ; however , hip hop music usually only reached 110 beats . The predominant score was electronica with some hip hop @-@ type and DMX @-@ type vocals . R & B and classic hip hop melodies were also used depending on the scenes , and each character had a specific theme . Wolf composed the opening theme for the first two seasons . Starting from the third season , the show had a new opening theme , written by Master P and Lil ' Romeo ( and performed by the latter ) .

J. McLean . Guest crew was also featured , including cartoonist Rick Hoberg as storyboard artist , and Paul Dini and John Ridley as writers .

As of December 2000 , it was the highest @-@ rated pre @-@ teen — from 2 to 11 years — show among all networks on its timeslot , and the third best on the Kids ' WB ! lineup . From its debut to July 2003 , the show secured the second post among boys aged 6 to 11 years . Ratings increased after Richie 's character obtained superhero powers ; McDuffie affirmed that this is what secured the renewal for a new season . Indeed , the show 's third season was its most popular and was the second best @-@ rated Saturday morning program among boys aged 6 to 11 years , and tweens and male tweens aged 9 to 14 . From February to April 2003 , ratings regularly performed over the 4 @.@ 0 stake among the public aged 9 to 14 years ; it even reached the 6 @.@ 4 mark in May . Static Shock 's last season was only surpassed by the children 's anime Pokémon , and the show 's reruns on Cartoon Network were only surpassed by the adult animated sitcom Family Guy . Static Shock was the only program on Cartoon Network to be among the top 30 most watched kids shows in a week of October 2004 . It was also the best rated program of the channel among kids on a week of January 2005 , and the best rated show on Cartoon Network 's <unk> block as of March 2005 . For the 2004 – 05 season , it was the 18th most watched Saturday morning children 's show of all networks . Static Shock was ultimately cancelled due to the low production of associated merchandising products .

 While Levine praised " its bright , cartoony visuals [ that ] are a notch above those of many other animated series , " Sinnott considered some of the animation to be " a little stilted . " Sinnott called it " a fun series overall " , but considered some jokes to be " a little stale " . Neil Dorsett of DVD Verdict was generally disappointed ; he called voice acting " very standard " , and said that " artwork and animation are also both behind the times " . Dorsett also criticized Virgil 's one @-@ lines , which " invites , like many other elements of the series , comparison to Spider @-@ Man .

 The show 's popularity led to new demand for Milestone 's Static comics : the first four issues of it were reissued as Static Shock : Trial by Fire in 2000 and a miniseries , Static Shock ! : Rebirth of the Cool , was released between January and September 2001 . In May 2003 , Midway Games announced the production of a platformer video game based on the show for the Game Boy Advance . Although it was displayed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo , the game was later cancelled . For a period starting on July 4 , 2004 , Subway Restaurants released a series of toys based on the TV series to be offered in the United States and Canada . On September 1 , 2004 , Scholastic Corporation published two tie @-@ in children 's books written by Tracey West . 
 McDuffie 's work on Static Shock placed him in the circles of animated series , and he became a writer and producer for shows like Justice League , Teen Titans , Justice League Unlimited , and Ben 10 : Alien Force . McDuffie was responsible for diversifying the DC animated universe 's Justice League by including black and female characters . Moreover , Arie Kaplan credits McDuffie and his co @-@ writers for giving " a depth and complexity " the group was lacking since the 1970s .

 = Jon Vaughn = 
 Jonathan Stewart Vaughn ( born March 12 , 1970 ) is a former professional American football player who played running back and served as a kick returner in the National Football League ( NFL ) for 4 seasons from 1991 to 1994 for the Seattle Seahawks , New England Patriots , and Kansas City Chiefs . In his most productive season , he led the 1992 Patriots in rushing and led the NFL in kickoff returns with a 28 @.@ 2 yards per return average on twenty returns . Vaughn was the tenth NFL player to accumulate four kickoff return touchdowns during his career and the second to accumulate kickoff return touchdowns for three different teams . Vaughn measured 5 feet 9 inches ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) and 203 pounds ( 92 kg ) during his NFL playing days . 
 Prior to declaring himself eligible for the NFL Draft despite remaining eligibility , Vaughn had starred in the Big Ten Conference for the University of Michigan Wolverines earning Co @-@ Big Ten Offensive Football Player of the year honors for the 1990 Big Ten Champions during the 1990 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season . Vaughn had established new University of Michigan standards in 200 @-@ yard games and yards per carry . He had also previously been a record setting Missouri high school sprinter who for nearly two decades held both the Missouri State High School Activities Association ( <unk> ) 100 metre and 200 metre records .

 Vaughn was both born and raised in Florissant , Missouri , and attended McCluer North High School in Florissant . Vaughn 's 1988 Missouri State High School 200 meter dash record time of 21 @.@ 28 seconds stood until 2002 . His state meet time of 10 @.@ 44 seconds in the 100 metre event stood until 2007 as the Missouri High School record . 
 = = College = = 
 Vaughn had a short collegiate career for the University of Michigan Wolverines , but he played for back @-@ to @-@ back Big Ten Conference Champions . He accumulated rushing statistics in only sixteen NCAA games for the Wolverines over the course of two seasons . However , in his redshirt sophomore 1990 season he was selected Co @-@ Big Ten Offensive Football Player of the year ( along with University of Iowa Hawkeyes players Nick Bell and Matt Rodgers ) by the conference 's coaches when he started 11 of 12 games . Vaughn , who wore # 25 for the Michigan Wolverines football program in 1989 and 1990 , played running back after redshirting as a defensive back who wore # 46 in 1988 . 
 Vaughn has claims to several important distinctions in University of Michigan Football history . First , he continues to hold the University of Michigan career yards per attempt record ( minimum 200 attempts ) . Second , he opened the 1990 season by posting 201 rushing yards on September 15 , 1990 against University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish and following it up with 288 rushing yards against the University of California , Los Angeles Bruins on September 22 , 1990 at the Big House . This feat made him the first Michigan back to rush for 200 yards in consecutive games , a feat not duplicated until Mike Hart did so in 2004 . His third claim is that the 288 @-@ yard effort ranks third on the All @-@ time Michigan single game rushing yards list ( behind Ron Johnson 's 347 yards in 1968 against the Wisconsin Badgers and Tshimanga Biakabutuka 's 313 yards against the Ohio State Buckeyes in 1995 ) . In addition to these claims , his 1 @,@ 364 yards rushing that season still ranks 13th on the Michigan all @-@ time single season rushing list . During that redshirt sophomore season he paired with freshman Ricky Powers who set the Michigan freshman rushing record later broken by Hart and who tied with Vaughn for a team @-@ high five 100 @-@ yard rushing games although accumulating far fewer total yards than Vaughn . 
 During the 1990 season Vaughn was closely watched in the press . NCAA football rushing averages are calculated on a per game basis . Since Vaughn started the season with two 200 @-@ yard efforts , he was atop the rushing charts well into the season . He entered Michigan 's seventh game the weekend of October 28 , 1990 as the nation 's leading rusher . Entering the eighth week he was averaging over 144 yards per game and was still second in the nation and first in the Big Ten . He only gained a total of 94 yards in his ninth , tenth and eleventh games combined and entered Michigan 's bowl game as # 11 in the nation . He ran for 128 yards in his final game and ended the season as the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year . He also ended the season eleventh in the nation in rushing and second in the Big Ten with 112 @.@ 4 yards per game . 
 Oddly , despite his eventual professional success as a kickoff returner , he never returned kickoffs in college . In 1990 , Desmond Howard and Derrick Alexander shared the kick return duties . In 1989 , Desmond Howard and Tony Boles shared the role . 
 = = Professional football = = 
 He entered the 1991 National Football League Draft after his redshirt sophomore season , which began with him as the nation 's leading rusher through the end of October . The season trailed off as Powers got much of the late season workload with four consecutive 100 @-@ yard efforts in Michigan wins . Vaughn was one of a relatively small class of underclassmen , headlined by <unk> " Rocket " Ismail to be approved in the NFL 's second class of players allowed to declare themselves eligible for the draft despite remaining amateur eligibility . In addition to Vaughn , other headliners among the underclassmen were Herman Moore , Todd Marinovich and Rob Carpenter ( who also played for the 1991 Patriots ) . John Vaughn was drafted with the first pick of the fifth round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots . Coach Dick MacPherson used him sparingly from scrimmage in his rookie year as Leonard Russell was the featured back for the 1991 Patriots . However , he had 34 kickoff returns , including one touchdown for an average of 21 @.@ 1 yards in 1991 . He also completed a 13 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Marv Cook against the Houston Oilers on September 22 , 1991 in what would be the Patriots only non @-@ quarterback touchdown pass until Dave Meggett repeated the feat during the 1997 NFL season . 
 Although his totals were modest in New England , he led the team in rushing yards in 1992 with 451 yards on 113 carries . In addition , he had 20 kickoff returns for an average of 28 @.@ 2 yards , including another return touchdown . This second kickoff return touchdown was the last by a Patriot until Derrick <unk> repeated the feat in 1997 against the Buffalo Bills . Vaughn had his first 100 @-@ yard rushing game in 1992 with 110 yards on 20 carries on November 22 in a 24 – 3 win against the New York Jets at home . In 1992 , Vaughn had six fumbles on only 113 carries and 13 receptions , and five of the fumbles were lost to the other team . 
 After two seasons in New England , he was traded to the Seattle Seahawks for an undisclosed draft pick . During the 1993 NFL season , his workload was modest in the backfield with Chris Warren and John L. Williams , but when he got the chance to play for the 1993 Seahawks he rose to the occasion with a career best 131 yards on 26 carries . This was Vaughn 's second and last 100 @-@ yard rushing game . 
 Vaughn spent most of the 1994 NFL season with the Seahawks , but he was released after having three fumbles on only twenty @-@ seven carries . However , in December he was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs . In 1994 he did not accumulate statistics from the line of scrimmage either for the Seahawks or for the Chiefs , however he returned kickoffs for both teams and recorded a kick return touchdown for each , including a 91 @-@ yard runback against the Miami Dolphins for the Chiefs in 1994 . 
 Over the course of his NFL career he ran back a total of 4 kickoffs for touchdowns . This ranked him tenth ( 2 short of the record six ) in NFL history through the 2006 NFL season . He had been in a three @-@ way tie for eight upon his retirement before the 1995 NFL season . His kickoff return touchdowns for three different teams tied Ron Smith for the NFL record , which was broken during the 2007 NFL season by Allen Rossum who posted a touchdown return for his fourth different team . In 1991 , Vaughn averaged 21 @.@ 1 yards per return on 34 returns , which ranked 10th among those with 1 @.@ 2 returns per game . In 1992 , Vaughn posted a 28 @.@ 2 averaged on 20 returns to lead the National Football League ( Deion Sanders was second at 26 @.@ 7 ) . Despite his success as a kick returner , he was released during training camp in 1995 .

 = Sei whale = 
 The sei whale ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ) , Balaenoptera borealis , is a baleen whale , the third @-@ largest rorqual after the blue whale and the fin whale . It inhabits most oceans and adjoining seas , and prefers deep offshore waters . It avoids polar and tropical waters and semi @-@ enclosed bodies of water . The sei whale migrates annually from cool and subpolar waters in summer to winter in temperate and subtropical waters . 
 Reaching 19 @.@ 5 metres ( 64 ft ) long and weighing as much as 28 tonnes ( 28 long tons ; 31 short tons ) , the sei whale consumes an average of 900 kilograms ( 2 @,@ 000 lb ) of food every day ; its diet consists primarily of copepods , krill , and other zooplankton . It is among the fastest of all cetaceans , and can reach speeds of up to 50 kilometres per hour ( 31 mph ) ( 27 knots ) over short distances . The whale 's name comes from the Norwegian word for pollock , a fish that appears off the coast of Norway at the same time of the year as the sei whale . 
 Following large @-@ scale commercial whaling during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries , when over 255 @,@ 000 whales were taken , the sei whale is now internationally protected , although limited hunting occurs under a controversial research program conducted by Japan . As of 2008 , its worldwide population was about 80 @,@ 000 , nearly a third of its pre @-@ whaling population . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Sei is the Norwegian word for pollock , also referred to as <unk> , a close relative of codfish . Sei whales appeared off the coast of Norway at the same time as the pollock , both coming to feed on the abundant plankton . The specific name is the Latin word borealis , meaning northern . In the Pacific , the whale has been called the Japan <unk> ; " <unk> " was a common term used to refer to rorquals . In Japanese , the whale was called <unk> <unk> , or sardine whale , a name originally applied to Bryde 's whales by early Japanese whalers . Later , as modern whaling shifted to Sanriku — where both species occur — it was confused for the sei whale . Now the term only applies to the latter species . It has also been referred to as the lesser fin whale because it somewhat resembles the fin whale . The American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews compared the sei whale to the cheetah , because it can swim at great speeds " for a few hundred yards " , but it " soon tires if the chase is long " and " does not have the strength and staying power of its larger relatives " . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 On 21 February 1819 , a 32 @-@ ft whale stranded near <unk> , in Schleswig @-@ Holstein . The Swedish @-@ born German naturalist Karl Rudolphi initially identified it as Balaena rostrata ( = Balaenoptera acutorostrata ) . In 1823 , the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described and figured Rudolphi 's specimen under the name " rorqual du Nord " . In 1828 , Rene Lesson translated this term into Balaenoptera borealis , basing his designation partly on Cuvier 's description of Rudolphi 's specimen and partly on a 54 @-@ ft female that had stranded on the coast of France the previous year ( this was later identified as a juvenile fin whale , Balaenoptera physalus ) . In 1846 , the English zoologist John Edward Gray , ignoring Lesson 's designation , named Rudolphi 's specimen Balaenoptera laticeps , which others followed . In 1865 , the British zoologist William Henry Flower named a 45 @-@ ft specimen that had been obtained from Pekalongan , on the north coast of Java , <unk> ( = Balaenoptera ) schlegelii — in 1946 the Russian scientist A.G. Tomilin synonymized S. schlegelii and B. borealis , creating the subspecies B. b. schlegelii and B. b. borealis . In 1884 @-@ 85 , the Norwegian scientist G. A. Guldberg first identified the " <unk> " of Finnmark with B. borealis . 
 Sei whales are rorquals ( family Balaenopteridae ) , baleen whales that include the humpback whale , the blue whale , the Bryde 's whale , the fin whale , and the minke whale . Rorquals take their name from the Norwegian word <unk> , meaning " furrow whale " , because family members have a series of longitudinal pleats or grooves on the anterior half of their ventral surface . Balaenopterids diverged from the other families of suborder Mysticeti , also called the whalebone whales or great whales , as long ago as the middle Miocene . Little is known about when members of the various families in the Mysticeti , including the Balaenopteridae , diverged from each other . 
 Two subspecies have been identified — the northern sei whale ( Balaenoptera borealis borealis ) and southern sei whale ( Balaenoptera borealis schlegelii ) . Their ranges do not overlap . 
 = = Description = = 
 The sei whale is the fourth @-@ largest <unk> , after the blue whale ( up to 180 tonnes , 200 tons ) and the fin whale ( up to 70 tonnes , 77 tons ) and the humpback whale ( up to 40 tonnes , 44 @.@ 5 tons ) . In the North Pacific , adult males average 13 @.@ 7 m ( 45 ft ) and adult females 15 m ( 49 ft ) , weighing 15 and 18 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 16 @.@ 5 and 20 @.@ 5 tons ) , while in the North Atlantic adult males average 14 m ( 46 ft ) and adult females 14 @.@ 5 m ( 48 ft ) , weighing 15 @.@ 5 and 17 tonnes ( 17 and 18 @.@ 5 tons ) In the Southern Hemisphere they average 14 @.@ 5 ( 47 @.@ 5 ft ) and 15 m ( 49 ft ) , respectively , weighing 17 and 18 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 18 @.@ 5 and 20 @.@ 5 tons ) . ( In the Northern Hemisphere , males reach up to 17 @.@ 1 m ( 56 ft ) and females up to 18 @.@ 6 m ( 61 ft ) , while in the Southern Hemisphere males reach 18 @.@ 6 m ( 61 ft ) and females 19 @.@ 5 m ( 64 ft ) — the authenticity of an alleged 22 m ( 72 ft ) female caught fifty miles northwest of St. Kilda in July 1911 is doubted . The largest specimens taken off Iceland were a 16 @.@ 15 m ( 53 @.@ 0 ft ) female and a 14 @.@ 6 m ( 48 ft ) male , while the longest off Nova Scotia were two 15 @.@ 8 m ( 52 ft ) females and a 15 @.@ 2 m ( 50 ft ) male . The longest measured during JARPN II cruises in the North Pacific were a 16 @.@ 32 m ( 53 @.@ 5 ft ) female and a 15 m ( 49 ft ) male . The longest measured by Discovery Committee staff were an adult male of 16 @.@ 15 m ( 53 @.@ 0 ft ) and an adult female of 17 @.@ 1 m ( 56 ft ) , both caught off South Georgia . Adults usually weigh between 15 and 20 metric tons — a 16 @.@ 4 m ( 54 ft ) pregnant female caught off Natal in 1966 weighed 37 @.@ 75 tonnes ( 41 @.@ 6 tons ) , not including 6 % for loss of fluids during flensing . Females are considerably larger than males . At birth , a calf typically measures 4 @.@ 4 – 4 @.@ 5 m ( 14 – 15 ft ) in length . 
 = = Anatomy = = 
 The whale 's body is typically a dark steel grey with irregular light grey to white markings on the ventral surface , or towards the front of the lower body . The whale has a relatively short series of 32 – 60 pleats or grooves along its ventral surface that extend halfway between the pectoral fins and umbilicus ( in other species it usually extends to or past the umbilicus ) , restricting the expansion of the buccal cavity during feeding compared to other species . The rostrum is pointed and the pectoral fins are relatively short , only 9 % – 10 % of body length , and pointed at the tips . It has a single ridge extending from the tip of the rostrum to the paired blowholes that are a distinctive characteristic of baleen whales . 
 The whale 's skin is often marked by pits or wounds , which after healing become white scars . These are now known to be caused by " cookie @-@ cutter " sharks ( Isistius brasiliensis ) . It has a tall , sickle @-@ shaped dorsal fin that ranges in height from 38 – 90 centimetres ( 15 – 35 in ) and averages 53 – 56 centimetres ( 21 – 22 in ) , about two @-@ thirds of the way back from the tip of the rostrum . Dorsal fin shape , pigmentation pattern , and scarring have been used to a limited extent in photo @-@ identification studies . The tail is thick and the fluke , or lobe , is relatively small in relation to the size of the whale 's body . 
 Adults have 300 – 380 ashy @-@ black baleen plates on each side of the mouth , up to 80 centimetres ( 31 in ) long . Each plate is made of fingernail @-@ like keratin , which is bordered by a fringe of very fine , short , curly , wool @-@ like white bristles . The sei 's very fine baleen bristles , about 0 @.@ 1 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 004 in ) are the most reliable characteristic that distinguishes it from other rorquals . 
 The sei whale looks similar to other large baleen whales . The best way to distinguish between it and Bryde 's whale , apart from differences in baleen plates , is by the presence of lateral ridges on the dorsal surface of the Bryde 's whale 's rostrum . Large individuals can be confused with fin whales , unless the fin whale 's asymmetrical head coloration is clearly seen . The fin whale 's lower jaw 's right side is white , and the left side is grey . When viewed from the side , the rostrum appears slightly arched ( accentuated at the tip ) , while fin and Bryde 's whales have relatively flat rostrums . 
 = = Life history = = 
 = = = Surface behaviors = = = 
 Sei whales usually travel alone or in pods of up to six individuals . Larger groups may assemble at particularly abundant feeding grounds . Very little is known about their social structure . During the southern Gulf of Maine influx in mid @-@ 1986 , groups of at least three sei whales were observed " milling " on four occasions - i.e. moving in random directions , rolling , and remaining at the surface for over ten minutes . One whale would always leave the group during or immediately after such socializing bouts . The sei whale is among the fastest cetaceans . It can reach speeds of up to 50 kilometres per hour ( 27 kn ) over short distances . However , it is not a remarkable diver , reaching relatively shallow depths for five to fifteen minutes . Between dives , the whale surfaces for a few minutes , remaining visible in clear , calm waters , with blows occurring at intervals of about 60 seconds ( range : 45 – 90 sec . ) . Unlike the fin whale , the sei whale tends not to rise high out of the water as it dives , usually just sinking below the surface . The blowholes and dorsal fin are often exposed above the water surface almost simultaneously . The whale almost never lifts its flukes above the surface , and are generally less active on water surfaces than close related Bryde 's whales ; it rarely breaches . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 This rorqual is a filter feeder , using its baleen plates to obtain its food by opening its mouth , engulfing or skimming large amounts of the water containing the food , then straining the water out through the baleen , trapping any food items inside its mouth . 
 The sei whale feeds near the surface of the ocean , swimming on its side through swarms of prey to obtain its average of about 900 kilograms ( 2 @,@ 000 lb ) of food each day . For an animal of its size , for the most part , its preferred foods lie unusually relatively low in the food chain , including zooplankton and small fish . The whale 's diet preferences has been determined from stomach analyses , direct observation of feeding behavior , and analyzing fecal matter collected near them , which appears as a dilute brown cloud . The feces are collected in nets and DNA is separated , individually identified , and matched with known species . The whale competes for food against <unk> fish ( herring and its relatives ) , basking sharks , and right whales . 
 In the North Atlantic , it feeds primarily on <unk> copepods , specifically Calanus <unk> , with a secondary preference for euphausiids , in particular Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoessa inermis . In the North Pacific , it feeds on similar zooplankton , including the copepod species Neocalanus cristatus , N. <unk> , and Calanus pacificus , and euphausiid species Euphausia pacifica , E. similis , Thysanoessa inermis , T. longipes , T. gregaria and T. spinifera . In addition , it eats larger organisms , such as the Japanese flying squid , Todarodes pacificus pacificus , and small fish , including anchovies ( Engraulis japonicus and E. mordax ) , sardines ( Sardinops sagax ) , Pacific saury ( <unk> saira ) , mackerel ( Scomber japonicus and S. <unk> ) , jack mackerel ( <unk> <unk> ) and juvenile rockfish ( Sebastes jordani ) . Some of these fish are commercially important . Off central California , they mainly feed on anchovies between June and August , and on krill ( Euphausia pacifica ) during September and October . In the Southern Hemisphere , prey species include the copepods Neocalanus <unk> , Calanus <unk> , and <unk> pectinatus , as well as the euphausiids Euphausia superba and Euphausia <unk> and the pelagic amphipod Themisto <unk> . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Mating occurs in temperate , subtropical seas during the winter . Gestation is estimated to vary around 103 ⁄ 4 months , 111 ⁄ 4 months , or one year , depending which model of foetal growth is used . The different estimates result from scientists ' inability to observe an entire pregnancy ; most reproductive data for baleen whales were obtained from animals caught by commercial whalers , which offers only a single snapshot of fetal growth . Researchers attempt to extrapolate conception dates by comparing fetus size and characteristics with newborns . 
 A newborn is weaned from its mother at 6 – 9 months of age , when it is 8 – 9 metres ( 26 – 30 ft ) long , so weaning takes place at the summer or autumn feeding grounds . Females reproduce every 2 – 3 years , usually to a single calf . In the Northern Hemisphere , males are usually 12 @.@ 8 – 12 @.@ 9 m ( 42 – 42 ft ) and females 13 @.@ 3 – 13 @.@ 4 m ( 44 – 44 ft ) at sexual maturity , while in the Southern Hemisphere males average 13 @.@ 6 m ( 45 ft ) and females 14 m ( 46 ft ) . The average age of sexual maturity of both sexes is 8 – 10 years . The whales can reach ages of up to 65 years . 
 = = = Vocalizations = = = 
 The sei whale makes long , loud , low @-@ frequency sounds . Relatively little is known about specific calls , but in 2003 , observers noted sei whale calls in addition to sounds that could be described as " growls " or " whooshes " off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula . Many calls consisted of multiple parts at different frequencies . This combination distinguishes their calls from those of other whales . Most calls lasted about a half second , and occurred in the 240 – 625 hertz range , well within the range of human hearing . The maximum volume of the vocal sequences is reported as 156 decibels relative to 1 micropascal ( μPa ) at a reference distance of one metre . An observer situated one metre from a vocalizing whale would perceive a volume roughly equivalent to the volume of a jackhammer operating two metres away . 
 In November 2002 , scientists recorded calls in the presence of sei whales off Maui . All the calls were downswept tonal calls , all but two ranging from a mean high frequency of 39 @.@ 1 Hz down to 21 Hz of 1 @.@ 3 second duration – the two higher frequency downswept calls ranged from an average of 100 @.@ 3 Hz to 44 @.@ 6 Hz over 1 second of duration . These calls closely resembled and coincided with a peak in " 20- to 35 @-@ Hz irregular repetition interval " downswept pulses described from seafloor recordings off Oahu , which had previously been attributed to fin whales . Between 2005 and 2007 , low frequency downswept vocalizations were recorded in the Great South Channel , east of Cape Cod , Massachusetts , which were only significantly associated with the presence of sei whales . These calls averaged 82 @.@ 3 Hz down to 34 Hz over about 1 @.@ 4 seconds in duration . This call has also been reported from recordings in the Gulf of Maine , New England shelf waters , the mid @-@ Atlantic Bight , and in Davis Strait . It likely functions as a contact call . 
 BBC News quoted Roddy Morrison , a former whaler active in South Georgia , as saying , " When we killed the sei whales , they used to make a noise , like a crying noise . They seemed so friendly , and they 'd come round and they 'd make a noise , and when you hit them , they cried really . I didn 't think it was really nice to do that . Everybody talked about it at the time I suppose , but it was money . At the end of the day that 's what counted at the time . That 's what we were there for . " 
 = = Range and migration = = 
 Sei whales live in all oceans , although rarely in polar or tropical waters . The difficulty of distinguishing them at sea from their close relatives , Bryde 's whales and in some cases from fin whales , creates confusion about their range and population , especially in warmer waters where Bryde 's whales are most common . 
 In the North Atlantic , its range extends from southern Europe or northwestern Africa to Norway , and from the southern United States to Greenland . The southernmost confirmed records are strandings along the northern Gulf of Mexico and in the Greater Antilles . Throughout its range , the whale tends not to frequent semi @-@ enclosed bodies of water , such as the Gulf of Mexico , the Gulf of Saint Lawrence , Hudson Bay , the North Sea , and the Mediterranean Sea . It occurs predominantly in deep water , occurring most commonly over the continental slope , in basins situated between banks , or submarine canyon areas . 
 In the North Pacific , it ranges from 20 ° N to 23 ° N latitude in the winter , and from 35 ° N to 50 ° N latitude in the summer . Approximately 75 % of the North Pacific population lives east of the International Date Line , but there is little information regarding the North Pacific distribution . Two whales tagged in deep waters off California were later recaptured off Washington and British Columbia , revealing a possible link between these areas , but the lack of other tag recovery data makes these two cases inconclusive . In Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk , whales are not common although whales were more commonly seen than today in southern part of Sea of Japan from Korean Peninsula to the southern Primorsky Krai in the past , and there had been a sighting in Golden Horn Bay , and whales were much more abundant in the triangle area around <unk> Island in whaling days , making the area well known as sei - ground , and there had been a sighting of a cow calf pair off the coast of mid @-@ Honshu during cetacean survey . 
 In the Southern Hemisphere , summer distribution based upon historic catch data is between 40 ° S and 50 ° S latitude in the South Atlantic and southern Indian Oceans and 45 ° S and 60 ° S in the South Pacific , while winter distribution is poorly known , with former winter whaling grounds being located off northeastern Brazil ( 7 ° S ) and Peru ( 6 ° S ) . The majority of the " sei " whales caught off Angola and Congo , as well as other nearby areas in equatorial West Africa , are thought to have been predominantly misidentified Bryde 's whales . For example , Ruud ( 1952 ) found that 42 of the " sei whale " catch off Gabon in 1952 were actually Bryde 's whales , based on examination of their baleen plates . The only confirmed historical record is the capture of a 14 m ( 46 ft ) female , which was brought to the Cap Lopez whaling station in Gabon in September 1950 . During cetacean sighting surveys off Angola between 2003 and 2006 , only a single confirmed sighting of two individuals was made in August 2004 , compared to 19 sightings of Bryde 's whales . Sei whales are commonly distributed along west to southern Latin America including along entire Chilean coasts , within Beagle Channel to Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego , and possibly feed in the <unk> region . 
 = = = Migration = = = 
 In general , the sei whale migrates annually from cool and subpolar waters in summer to temperate and subtropical waters for winter , where food is more abundant . In the northwest Atlantic , sightings and catch records suggest the whales move north along the shelf edge to arrive in the areas of Georges Bank , Northeast Channel , and Browns Bank by mid to late June . They are present off the south coast of Newfoundland in August and September , and a southbound migration begins moving west and south along the Nova Scotian shelf from mid @-@ September to mid @-@ November . Whales in the Labrador Sea as early as the first week of June may move farther northward to waters southwest of Greenland later in the summer . In the northeast Atlantic , the sei whale winters as far south as West Africa such as off Bay of Arguin , off coastal Western Sahara and follows the continental slope northward in spring . Large females lead the northward migration and reach the Denmark Strait earlier and more reliably than other sexes and classes , arriving in mid @-@ July and remaining through mid @-@ September . In some years , males and younger females remain at lower latitudes during the summer months . 
 Despite knowing some general migration patterns , exact routes are incompletely known and scientists cannot readily predict exactly where groups will appear from one year to the next . F.O. <unk> noted a correlation between appearances west of Greenland and the incursion of relatively warm waters from the <unk> Current into that area . Some evidence from tagging data indicates individuals return off the coast of Iceland on an annual basis . An individual satellite tagged off Faial , in the Azores , traveled more than 4 @,@ 000 km ( 2 @,@ 500 mi ) to the Labrador Sea via the Charlie @-@ Gibbs Fracture Zone ( <unk> ) between April and June 2005 . It appeared to " hitch a ride " on prevailing currents , with erratic movements indicative of feeding behavior in five areas , in particular the <unk> , an area of known high sei whale abundance as well as high copepod concentrations . Seven whales tagged off Faial and Pico from May to June in 2008 and 2009 made their way to the Labrador Sea , while an eighth individual tagged in September 2009 headed southeast – its signal was lost between Madeira and the Canary Islands .

 The development of explosive harpoons and steam @-@ powered whaling ships in the late nineteenth century brought previously unobtainable large whales within reach of commercial whalers . Initially their speed and elusiveness , and later the comparatively small yield of oil and meat partially protected them . Once stocks of more profitable right whales , blue whales , fin whales , and humpback whales became depleted , sei whales were hunted in earnest , particularly from 1950 to 1980 . 
 = = = North Atlantic = = = 
 In the North Atlantic between 1885 and 1984 , 14 @,@ 295 sei whales were taken . They were hunted in large numbers off the coasts of Norway and Scotland beginning in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , and in 1885 alone , more than 700 were caught off Finnmark . Their meat was a popular Norwegian food . The meat 's value made the hunting of this difficult @-@ to @-@ catch species profitable in the early twentieth century . 
 In Iceland , a total of 2 @,@ 574 whales were taken from the Hvalfjörður whaling station between 1948 and 1985 . Since the late 1960s to early 1970s , the sei whale has been second only to the fin whale as the preferred target of Icelandic whalers , with meat in greater demand than whale oil , the prior target . 
 Small numbers were taken off the Iberian Peninsula , beginning in the 1920s by Spanish whalers , off the Nova Scotian shelf in the late 1960s and early 1970s by Canadian whalers , and off the coast of West Greenland from the 1920s to the 1950s by Norwegian and Danish whalers .

 In the North Pacific , the total reported catch by commercial whalers was 72 @,@ 215 between 1910 and 1975 ; the majority were taken after 1947 . Shore stations in Japan and Korea , processed 300 – 600 each year between 1911 and 1955 . In 1959 , the Japanese catch peaked at 1 @,@ 340 . Heavy exploitation in the North Pacific began in the early 1960s , with catches averaging 3 @,@ 643 per year from 1963 to 1974 ( total 43 @,@ 719 ; annual range 1 @,@ 280 – 6 @,@ 053 ) . In 1971 , after a decade of high catches , it became scarce in Japanese waters , ending commercial whaling in 1975 . 
 Off the coast of North America , sei whales were hunted off British Columbia from the late 1950s to the mid @-@ 1960s , when the number of whales captured dropped to around 14 per year . More than 2 @,@ 000 were caught in British Columbia waters between 1962 and 1967 . Between 1957 and 1971 , California shore stations processed 386 whales .

 A total of 152 @,@ 233 were taken in the Southern Hemisphere between 1910 and 1979 . Whaling in southern oceans originally targeted humpback whales . By 1913 , this species became rare , and the catch of fin and blue whales began to increase . As these species likewise became scarce , sei whale catches increased rapidly in the late 1950s and early 1960s . The catch peaked in 1964 @-@ 65 at over 20 @,@ 000 sei whales , but by 1976 , this number had dropped to below 2 @,@ 000 and commercial whaling for the species ended in 1977 .

 Since the moratorium on commercial whaling , some sei whales have been taken by Icelandic and Japanese whalers under the IWC 's scientific research programme . Iceland carried out four years of scientific whaling between 1986 and 1989 , killing up to 40 sei whales a year . Japanese scientists catch about 50 sei whales each year for this purpose . The research is conducted by the Institute of Cetacean Research ( ICR ) in Tokyo , a privately funded , nonprofit institution . The main focus of the research is to examine what they eat and to assess the competition between whales and fisheries . Dr. Seiji <unk> , Director General of the ICR , said , 
 " It is estimated that whales consume 3 to 5 times the amount of marine resources as are caught for human consumption , so our whale research is providing valuable information required for improving the management of all our marine resources . " 
 He later added , 
 " Sei whales are the second most abundant species of whale in the western North Pacific , with an estimated population of over 28 @,@ 000 animals . [ It is ] clearly not endangered . " 
 Conservation groups , such as the World Wildlife Fund , dispute the value of this research , claiming that sei whales feed primarily on squid and plankton which are not hunted by humans , and only rarely on fish . They say that the program is 
 " nothing more than a plan designed to keep the whaling fleet in business , and the need to use whales as the scapegoat for overfishing by humans . " 
 At the 2001 meeting of the IWC Scientific Committee , 32 scientists submitted a document expressing their belief that the Japanese program lacked scientific rigour and would not meet minimum standards of academic review . 
 In 2010 , a Los Angeles restaurant confirmed to be serving sei whale meat was closed by its owners after prosecution by authorities for handling a protected species . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The sei whale did not have meaningful international protection until 1970 , when the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) first set catch quotas for the North Pacific for individual species . Before quotas , there were no legal limits . Complete protection from commercial whaling in the North Pacific came in 1976 . 
 Quotas on sei whales in the North Atlantic began in 1977 . Southern Hemisphere stocks were protected in 1979 . Facing mounting evidence that several whale species were threatened with extinction , the IWC established a complete moratorium on commercial whaling beginning in 1986 . 
 In the late 1970s , some " pirate " whaling took place in the eastern North Atlantic . There is no direct evidence of illegal whaling in the North Pacific , although the acknowledged <unk> of whaling data by the Soviet Union means that catch data are not entirely reliable . 
 The species remained listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2000 , categorized as " endangered " . Northern Hemisphere populations are listed as CITES Appendix II , indicating they are not immediately threatened with extinction , but may become so if they are not listed . Populations in the Southern Hemisphere are listed as CITES Appendix I , indicating they are threatened with extinction if trade is not halted . 
 The Sei whale is listed on both Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ( CMS ) . It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals , conserving or restoring the places where they live , mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them and also on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co @-@ operation organised by tailored agreements . 
 Sei whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region ( Pacific Cetaceans MOU ) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic , North East Atlantic , Irish and North Seas ( ACCOBAMS ) . 
 The species is listed as endangered by the U.S. government National Marine Fisheries Service under the U.S. Endangered Species Act . 
 = = Population estimates = = 
 The current population is estimated at 80 @,@ 000 , nearly a third of the pre @-@ whaling population . A 1991 study in the North Atlantic estimated only 4 @,@ 000 . Sei whales were said to have been scarce in the 1960s and early 1970s off northern Norway . One possible explanation for this disappearance is that the whales were overexploited . The drastic reduction in northeastern Atlantic copepod stocks during the late 1960s may be another culprit . Surveys in the Denmark Strait found 1 @,@ 290 whales in 1987 , and 1 @,@ 590 whales in 1989 . Nova Scotia 's population estimates are between 1 @,@ 393 and 2 @,@ 248 , with a minimum of 870 . 
 A 1977 study estimated Pacific Ocean totals of 9 @,@ 110 , based upon catch and CPUE data . Japanese interests claim this figure is outdated , and in 2002 claimed the western North Pacific population was over 28 @,@ 000 , a figure not accepted by the scientific community . In California waters , there was only one confirmed and five possible sightings by 1991 to 1993 aerial and ship surveys , and there were no confirmed sightings off Oregon coasts such as Maumee Bay and Washington . Prior to commercial whaling , the North Pacific hosted an estimated 42 @,@ 000 . By the end of whaling , the population was down to between 7 @,@ 260 and 12 @,@ 620 . 
 In the Southern Hemisphere , population estimates range between 9 @,@ 800 and 12 @,@ 000 , based upon catch history and CPUE . The IWC estimated 9 @,@ 718 whales based upon survey data between 1978 and 1988 . Prior to commercial whaling , there were an estimated 65 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Mass deaths = = 
 Mass death events for sei whales have been recorded for many years and evidence suggests endemic poisoning ( " marea <unk> " ) causes may have caused mass deaths in prehistoric times . In June 2015 , scientists flying over southern Chile counted 337 dead sei whales , in what is regarded as the largest mass beaching ever documented . The cause is not yet known ; however , toxic algae blooms caused by unprecedented warming in the Pacific Ocean , known as The Blob ( Pacific Ocean ) may be implicated .

 = = = Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad = = = 
 The Boonton Branch of the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad was first constructed as a freight bypass of the Morris & Essex Railroad in 1868 . This was constructed due to the lack of freight along its passenger lines and stretched from the Denville station to Hoboken Terminal via Boonton and Paterson . The line had shops at Kingsland , built in 1868 for the purpose of repairing , restoring and re @-@ erecting train cars and locomotives for the line . In 1875 , shop equipment from Hoboken was moved over to Kingsland . However , just seven years later , the machine shop , also the main building of the shops , caught fire and was completely destroyed . However , despite the fire , the structure was immediately reconstructed for use . During this time , the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western used a small house as a station depot . 
 When the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western expanded the Kingsland Shops in 1903 , a new station depot was constructed of brick along with a cut and cover tunnel . The tunnel itself cost $ 71 @,@ 500 ( 1903 USD ) and permitted the local street , Schuyler Avenue to cross over the rail line . The new station depot was built on Ridge Road over the tracks , with platforms crossing over the new bridge . The design of the station depot located above the tracks was later replicated by the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western 's Montclair Branch for its Watsessing Avenue station in Bloomfield , New Jersey . 
 In 1917 , the railroad was brought before the New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners due to an accident on November 28 , 1916 , at Kingsland station . Passenger train No. 582 , a special train for employees of the Canadian Car Company , had near stopped at Kingsland station . The train never left at any defined time , although averaged around 6 : 30 in the evening . However , around 6 : <unk> evening , Train No. 479 came in twelve minutes late at a high rate of speed , and as a result could not slow down fast enough to avoid hitting passengers . At that time , the station had no inter @-@ track fencing to prevent crossing of both Boonton Branch tracks , and because of this , people could board trains from either platform . That day the engineer of Train No. 479 was unable to see the platform or the special train , and due to the lack of signals , had no information until the train knowing anything until the train left the west portal of Kingsland Tunnel . However , signals were set for west @-@ bound trains if problems were to occur . After the accident , the Board requested the Lackawanna to install a westbound signal to prevent further accidents , while the Canadian Car Company moved its boarding to the company 's rail siding . 
 = = = Erie – Lackawanna Railroad and the Passaic Plan = = = 
 After several years of sharing railroad facilities , the Erie Railroad and Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad merged on October 17 , 1960 , replaced by the Erie @-@ Lackawanna Railway . Since 1949 the Erie Railroad had been dealing with the city of Passaic , New Jersey about its double track mainline through the city via Rutherford . Due to the high cost of removing the main line with no back @-@ up service , it was unable to progress forward , and as a result , the Erie built some new stations to replace old wooden ones in 1952 . With the railroad merger in 1960 , the Erie – Lackawanna had the Boonton Branch that also served Passaic , and on August 23 , 1960 , with pressure from the New Jersey Department of Transportation to go ahead with it , a deal was struck between the city of Passaic and the railroad . A new connection was to be made via the Erie 's old Newark Branch to connect the Boonton Branch to the old Erie main at South Paterson . The old Erie main line through Passaic was abandoned at a ceremony on April 2 , 1963 , when service was terminated and service . Trains were re @-@ routed via a " new " main line , using the Boonton Branch from Kingsland to Athenia . 
 The remainder of the Boonton Branch was steadily decommissioned through 1963 , as the New Jersey Department of Transportation requested the Boonton Branch 's alignment through Paterson as part of Interstate 80 and New Jersey Route 21 through Passaic near BE Drawbridge and the Passaic Park station . This was turned over to the Department of Transportation on October 27 , 1963 , after a connection was constructed at Mountain View to the Erie 's former New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad . The stretch from Paterson Junction to Totowa , including the Paterson High Bridge built in 1902 , was abandoned and soon dismantled . However , despite the changes , the Erie – Lackawanna continued to lose strength and in 1975 , agreed to become part of the Consolidated Rail Corporation , dubbed Conrail , effective April 1 , 1976 .

 In January 1983 , Consolidated Rail Corporation handed over operation of the commuter railroads to New Jersey Transit Rail Operations . On September 20 , 2002 , as part of the Montclair Connection , merging the Montclair Branch and Boonton Line , the Arlington station in Kearny was closed , resulting in the lack of a station in Kearny . As a result , a rail shuttle bus was created by the town of Kearny to bus passengers from Arlington station up to Kingsland via Route 76 bus route , giving rail passenger service to New York Penn Station and Hoboken Terminal . Shuttle buses were aligned at that time with the 5 : 02 AM , 6 : 03 PM and 7 : 08 PM . Services were adjusted for the timetable services on September 30 , 2002 . 
 On June 22 , 2010 , the town of Lyndhurst put forward a proposal to buy the station depots at both Kingsland and Lyndhurst stations . The mayor of Lyndhurst , Richard <unk> , said that the stations have seen better days and New Jersey Transit has no interest in renovating both buildings . Design plans for Kingsland station look towards a new coffee shop , after repairing and renovating the building . The station would also be converted from its old subway tile to a newer retro look for the building , paid for by leasing the building . Because an average of 440 to over 1 @,@ 000 people use the Kingsland station daily , it would look better for the town of Lyndhurst to make a good impression on the riders . <unk> 2012 , the station house was unoccupied .

 = Maus = 
 Maus is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman , serialized from 1980 to 1991 . It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor . The work employs postmodern techniques and represents Jews as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs . Critics have classified Maus as memoir , biography , history , fiction , autobiography , or a mix of genres . In 1992 it became the first graphic novel to win a Pulitzer Prize . 
 In the frame @-@ tale timeline in the narrative present that begins in 1978 in New York City , Spiegelman talks with his father Vladek about his Holocaust experiences , gathering material for the Maus project he is preparing . In the narrative past , Spiegelman depicts these experiences , from the years leading up to World War II to his parents ' liberation from the Nazi concentration camps . Much of the story revolves around Spiegelman 's troubled relationship with his father , and the absence of his mother who committed suicide when he was 20 . Her grief @-@ stricken husband destroyed her written accounts of Auschwitz . The book uses a minimalist drawing style and displays innovation in its pacing , and structure , and page layouts . 
 A three @-@ page strip also called " Maus " that he made in 1972 gave Spiegelman an opportunity to interview his father about his life during World War II . The recorded interviews became the basis for the graphic novel , which Spiegelman began in 1978 . He serialized Maus from 1980 until 1991 as an insert in Raw , an avant @-@ garde comics and graphics magazine published by Spiegelman and his wife , Françoise Mouly , who also appears in Maus . A collected volume of the first six chapters that appeared in 1986 brought the book mainstream attention ; a second volume collected the remaining chapters in 1991 . Maus was one of the first graphic novels to receive significant academic attention in the English @-@ speaking world . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Most of the book weaves in and out of two timelines . In the frame tale of the narrative present , Spiegelman interviews his father Vladek in the Rego Park neighborhood of New York City in 1978 – 79 . The story that Vladek tells unfolds in the narrative past , which begins in the mid @-@ 1930s and continues until the end of the Holocaust in 1945 . 
 In Rego Park in 1958 , a young Art Spiegelman complains to his father that his friends have left him behind . His father responds in broken English , " Friends ? Your friends ? If you lock them together in a room with no food for a week , then you could see what it is , friends ! " 
 As an adult , Art visits his father , from whom he has become estranged . Vladek has remarried to a woman called Mala since the suicide in 1968 of Art 's mother Anja . Art asks Vladek to recount his Holocaust experiences . Vladek tells of his time in the Polish city Częstochowa and how he came to marry into Anja 's wealthy family in 1937 and move to Sosnowiec to become a manufacturer . Vladek begs Art not to include this in the book , and Art reluctantly agrees . Anja suffers a breakdown due to postpartum depression after giving birth to their first son Richieu , and the couple go to a sanitarium in Nazi @-@ occupied Czechoslovakia for her to recover . After they return , political and antisemitic tensions build until Vladek is drafted just before the Nazi invasion . Vladek is captured at the front and forced to work as a prisoner of war . After his release , he finds Germany has annexed Sosnowiec , and he is dropped off on the other side of the border in the German protectorate . He sneaks across the border and reunites with his family . 
 During one of Art 's visits , he finds that a friend of Mala 's has sent the couple one of the underground comix magazines Art contributed to . Mala had tried to hide it , but Vladek finds and reads it . In " Prisoner on the Hell Planet " , Art is traumatized by his mother 's suicide three months after his release from the mental hospital , and in the end depicts himself behind bars saying , " You murdered me , Mommy , and left me here to take the rap ! " Though it brings back painful memories , Vladek admits that dealing with the issue in such a way was for the best . 
 In 1943 , the Nazis move the Jews of the Sosnowiec Ghetto to Srodula , and march them back to Sosnowiec to work . The family splits up — Vladek and Anja send Richieu to <unk> to stay with an aunt for safety . As more Jews are sent from the ghettos to Auschwitz , the aunt poisons herself , her children , and Richieu to escape the Gestapo . In Srodula , many Jews build bunkers to hide from the Germans . Vladek 's bunker is discovered and he is placed into a " ghetto inside the ghetto " surrounded by barbed wire . The remnants of Vladek and Anja 's family are taken away . Srodula is cleared of its Jews , except for a group Vladek hides with in another bunker . When the Germans depart , the group splits up and leaves the ghetto . 
 In Sosnowiec , Vladek and Anja move from one hiding place to the next , making occasional contact with other Jews in hiding . Vladek disguises himself as an ethnic Pole and hunts for provisions . The couple arrange with smugglers to escape to Hungary , but it is a trick — the Gestapo arrest them on the train and take them to Auschwitz , where they are separated until after the war . 
 Art asks after Anja 's diaries , which Vladek tells him were her account of her Holocaust experiences and the only record of what happened to her after her separation from Vladek at Auschwitz , and which Vladek says she had wanted Art to read . Vladek comes to admit that he burned them after she killed herself . Art is enraged , and calls Vladek a " murderer " . 
 The story jumps to 1986 , after the first six chapters of Maus have appeared in a collected edition . Art is overcome with the unexpected attention the book receives and finds himself " totally blocked " . Art talks about the book with his psychiatrist Paul Pavel , a Czech Holocaust survivor . Pavel suggests that , as those who perished in the camps can never tell their stories , " maybe it 's better not to have any more stories " . Art replies with a quote from Samuel Beckett : " Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness " , but then realizes , " on the other hand , he said it " . 
 Vladek tells of his hardship in the camps , of starvation and abuse , of his resourcefulness , of avoiding the <unk> — the process by which prisoners were selected for further labor or execution . Despite the danger , Anja and Vladek exchange occasional messages . As the war progresses and the German front is pushed back , the prisoners are marched from Auschwitz in occupied Poland to Gross @-@ Rosen within the Reich , and then to Dachau , where the hardships only increase and Vladek catches typhus . 
 The war ends , the camp survivors are freed , and Vladek and Anja reunite . The book closes with Vladek turning over in his bed as he finishes his story and telling Art , " I 'm tired from talking , Richieu , and it 's enough stories for now . " The final image is of Vladek and Anja 's tombstone — Vladek died in 1982 , before the book was completed .

 Art Spiegelman 
 Art ( born 1948 ) is a cartoonist and intellectual . Art is presented as egocentric , neurotic and obsessive , angry and full of self @-@ pity . He deals with his own traumas and those inherited from his parents by seeking psychiatric help , which continued after the book was completed . He has a strained relationship with his father , Vladek , by whom he feels dominated . At first , he displays little sympathy for his father 's hardships , but shows more as the narrative unfolds . 
 Vladek Spiegelman 
 Vladek ( 1906 – 1982 ) is a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust , then moved to the U.S. in the early 1950s . Speaking broken English , he is presented as miserly , anal retentive , anxious and obstinate — traits that may have helped him survive the camps , but which greatly annoy his family . He displays racist attitudes , as when Françoise picks up an African American hitchhiker , who he fears will rob them . He shows little insight into his own racist comments about others . 
 Mala Spiegelman 
 Mala ( 1917 – 2007 ) is Vladek 's second wife . Vladek makes her feel that she can never live up to Anja . Though she too is a survivor and speaks with Art throughout the book , Art makes no attempt to learn of her Holocaust experience . 
 Anja Spiegelman 
 Also a Polish Jew who has survived the Holocaust , Anja ( 1912 – 1968 ) is Art 's mother and Vladek 's first wife . Nervous , compliant , and clinging , she has her first nervous breakdown after giving birth to her first son . She sometimes told Art about the Holocaust while he was growing up , although his father did not want him to know about it . She killed herself by slitting her wrists in a bathtub in May 1968 , and left no suicide note . 
 Françoise Mouly 
 Françoise ( born 1955 ) is married to Art . She is French , and converted to Judaism to please Art 's father . It is unclear to Spiegelman whether she should be represented as a Jewish mouse , a French frog , or some other animal . 
 = = Background = = 
 Art Spiegelman was born on February 15 , 1948 , in Sweden to Polish Jews and Holocaust survivors Vladek and Anja Spiegelman . An aunt poisoned their first son Richieu to avoid capture by the Nazis four years before Spiegelman 's birth . He and his parents immigrated to the United States in 1951 . During his youth his mother occasionally talked about Auschwitz , but his father did not want him to know about it . 
 Spiegelman developed an interest in comics early and began drawing professionally at 16 . He spent a month in Binghamton State Mental Hospital in 1968 after a nervous breakdown . Shortly after he got out , his mother committed suicide . Spiegelman 's father was not happy with his son 's involvement in the hippie subculture . Spiegelman said that when he bought himself a German Volkswagen it damaged their already @-@ strained relationship " beyond repair " . Around this time , Spiegelman in fanzines about such graphic artists as Frans Masereel who had made wordless novels . The discussions in those fanzines about making the Great American Novel in comics inspired him . 
 Spiegelman became a key figure in the underground comix movement of the 1970s , both as cartoonist and editor . In 1972 Justin Green produced the semi @-@ autobiographical comic book Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary , which inspired other underground cartoonists to produce more personal and revealing work . The same year , Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three @-@ page strip for the first issue of Funny Aminals [ sic ] , which Green edited . Spiegelman wanted to do a strip about racism , and at first considered focusing on African Americans , with cats as Ku Klux Klan members chasing African @-@ American mice . Instead , he turned to the Holocaust and depicted Nazi cats persecuting Jewish mice in a strip he titled " Maus " . The tale was narrated to a mouse named " Mickey " . After finishing the strip , Spiegelman visited his father to show him the finished work , which he had based in part on an anecdote he had heard about his father 's Auschwitz experience . His father gave him further background information , which piqued Spiegelman 's interest . Spiegelman recorded a series of interviews over four days with his father , which was to provide the basis of the longer Maus . Spiegelman followed up with extensive research , reading survivors ' accounts and talking to friends and family who had also survived . He got detailed information about Sosnowiec from a series of Polish pamphlets published after the war which detailed what happened to the Jews by region . 
 In 1973 , Spiegelman produced a strip for Short Order Comix # 1 about his mother 's suicide called " Prisoner on the Hell Planet " . The same year , he edited a pornographic , psychedelic book of quotations , and dedicated it to his mother . He spent the rest of the 1970s building his reputation making short avant @-@ garde comics . He moved back to New York from San Francisco in 1975 , which he admitted to his father only in 1977 , by which time he had decided to work on a " very long comic book " . He began another series of interviews with his father in 1978 , and visited Auschwitz in 1979 . He serialized the story in a comics and graphics magazine he and his wife Mouly began in 1980 called Raw .

 American comic books were big business with a diversity of genres in the 1940s and 1950s , but had reached a low ebb by the late 1970s . By the time Maus began serialization , the " Big Two " comics publishers , Marvel and DC Comics , dominated the industry with mostly superhero titles . The underground comix movement that had flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s also seemed moribund . The public perception of comic books was as adolescent power fantasies , inherently incapable of mature artistic or literary expression . Most discussion focused on comics as a genre rather than a medium . 
 Maus came to prominence when the term " graphic novel " was beginning to gain currency . Will Eisner popularized the term with the publication in 1978 of A Contract with God . The term was used partly to mask the low cultural status that comics had in the English @-@ speaking world , and partly because the term " comic book " was being used to refer to short @-@ form periodicals , leaving no accepted vocabulary with which to talk about book @-@ form comics . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The first chapter of Maus appeared in December 1980 in the second issue of Raw as a small insert ; a new chapter appeared in each issue until the magazine came to an end in 1991 . Every chapter but the last appeared in Raw . 
 Spiegelman struggled to find a publisher for a book edition of Maus , but after a rave New York Times review of the serial in August 1986 , Pantheon Books published the first six chapters in a volume called Maus : A Survivor 's Tale and subtitled My Father <unk> History . Spiegelman was relieved that the book 's publication preceded the theatrical release of the animated film An American Tail by three months , as he believed that the film , produced by Steven Spielberg 's Amblin Entertainment , was inspired by Maus and wished to avoid comparisons with it . 
 The book found a large audience , partly because of its distribution through bookstores rather than the direct market comic shops where comic books were normally sold . Maus was difficult for critics and reviewers to classify , and also for booksellers , who needed to know on which shelves to place it . Though Pantheon pushed for the term " graphic novel " , Spiegelman was not comfortable with this , as many book @-@ length comics were being referred to as " graphic novels " whether or not they had novelistic qualities . He suspected the term 's use was an attempt to validate the comics form , rather than to describe the content of the books . Spiegelman later came to accept the term , and with Drawn and Quarterly publisher Chris Oliveros successfully lobbied the Book Industry Study Group in the early 2000s to include " graphic novel " as a category in bookstores . 
 Pantheon collected the last five chapters in 1991 in a second volume subtitled And Here My Troubles Began . Pantheon later collected the two volumes into <unk> and hardcover two @-@ volume boxed sets and single @-@ volume editions . In 1994 the Voyager Company released The Complete Maus on CD @-@ ROM , a collection which contained the original comics , Vladek 's taped transcripts , filmed interviews , sketches , and other background material . The CD @-@ ROM was based on HyperCard , a Macintosh @-@ only application that has since become obsolete . In 2011 Pantheon Books published a companion to The Complete Maus entitled MetaMaus , with further background material , including filmed footage of Vladek . The centerpiece of the book is a Spiegelman interview conducted by Hillary Chute . It also has interviews with Spiegelman 's wife and children , sketches , photographs , family trees , assorted artwork , and a DVD with video , audio , photos , and an interactive version of Maus . 
 Spiegelman dedicated Maus to his brother Richieu and his first daughter Nadja . The book 's epigraph is a quote from Adolf Hitler : " The Jews are undoubtedly a race , but they are not human . " 
 = = = International publication = = = 
 Penguin Books obtained the rights to publish the initial volume in the Commonwealth in 1986 . In support of the African National Congress 's cultural boycott in opposition to apartheid , Spiegelman refused to " compromise with fascism " by allowing publication of his work in South Africa . 
 By 2011 , Maus had been translated into about thirty languages . Three translations were particularly important to Spiegelman : French , as his wife was French , and because of his respect for the sophisticated Franco @-@ Belgian comics tradition ; German , given the book 's background ; and Polish . Poland was the setting for most of the book and Polish was the language of his parents and his own mother tongue . The publishers of the German edition had to convince the German culture ministry of the work 's serious intent to have the swastika appear on the cover , per laws prohibiting the display of Nazi symbolism . Reception in Germany was positive — Maus was a best @-@ seller and was taught in schools . The Polish translation encountered difficulties ; as early as 1987 , when Spiegelman planned a research visit to Poland , the Polish consulate official who approved his visa questioned him about the Poles ' depiction as pigs and pointed out how serious an insult it was . Publishers and commentators refused to deal with the book for fear of protests and boycotts . Piotr <unk> , a journalist for Gazeta Wyborcza , set up his own publishing house to publish Maus in Polish in 2001 . Demonstrators protested Maus 's publication and burned the book in front of Gazeta 's offices . <unk> 's response was to don a pig mask and wave to the protesters from the office windows . The magazine @-@ sized Japanese translation was the only authorized edition with larger pages . Long @-@ standing plans for an Arabic translation have yet to come to fruition . A Russian law passed in December 2014 prohibiting the display of Nazi propaganda led to the removal of Maus from Russian bookstores leading up to Victory Day due to the swastika appearing on the book 's cover . 
 A few panels were changed for the Hebrew edition of Maus . Based on Vladek 's memory , Spiegelman portrayed one of the minor characters as a member of the Nazi @-@ installed Jewish Police . An Israeli descendant objected and threatened to sue for libel . Spiegelman redrew the character with a fedora in place of his original police hat , but appended a note to the volume voicing his objection to this " intrusion " . This version of the first volume appeared in 1990 from the publishing house <unk> Bitan . It had an indifferent or negative reception , and the publisher did not release the second volume . Another Israeli publisher put out both volumes , with a new translation by poet Yehuda <unk> that included Vladek 's broken language , which <unk> Bitan had refused to do . Marilyn <unk> saw this as highlighting a difference between the self @-@ image of the Israeli Jew as fearless defender of the homeland , and that of the American Jew as feeble victim , something that one Israeli writer disparaged as " the diaspora sickness " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = Presentation = = = 
 Spiegelman , like many of his critics , worries that " [ r ] <unk> is too much for comics ... so much has to be left out or distorted " , admitting that his presentation of the story may not be accurate . He takes a postmodern approach ; Maus " feeds on itself " , telling the story of how the story was made . It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father 's memories , and the artistic choices he had to make — for example , when his French wife converts to Judaism , Spiegelman 's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog , a mouse , or other animal . 
 The book portrays humans with the heads and tails of different species of animals ; Jews are drawn as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs , among others . Spiegelman took advantage of the way Nazi propaganda films depicted Jews as vermin , though he was first struck by the metaphor after attending a presentation where Ken Jacobs showed films of minstrel shows along with early American animated films , abundant with racial caricatures . Spiegelman derived the mouse as symbol for the Jew from Nazi propaganda , emphasized in a quote from a German newspaper in the 1930s that prefaces the second volume : " Mickey Mouse is the most miserable idea ever revealed ... Healthy emotions tell every independent young man and every honorable youth that the dirty and filth @-@ covered vermin , the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom , cannot be the ideal type of animal ... Away with Jewish brutalization of the people ! Down with Mickey Mouse ! Wear the Swastika Cross ! " 
 Jewish characters try to pass themselves off as ethnic Poles by tying pig masks to their faces , with the strings showing at the back . Vladek 's disguise was more convincing than Anja 's — " you could see she was more Jewish " , Vladek says . Spiegelman shows this Jewishness by having her tail hang out of her disguise . This <unk> of the genocidal stereotypes that drove the Nazis to their Final Solution may risk reinforcing racist labels , but Spiegelman uses the idea to create anonymity for the characters . According to art historian Andrea Liss , this may paradoxically enable the reader to identify with the characters as human , preventing the reader from observing racial characteristics based on facial traits , while reminding readers that racist classification is ever present . 
 In making people of each ethnicity look alike , Spiegelman hoped to show the absurdity of dividing people along such lines . Spiegelman has stated that " these metaphors ... are meant to self @-@ destruct " and " reveal the inanity of the notion itself " . Professor Amy Hungerford saw no consistent system to the animal metaphor . Rather , it signified the characters ' roles in the story rather than their races — the gentile Françoise is a mouse because of her identification with her husband , who identifies with the Holocaust victims . When asked what animal he would make Israeli Jews , Spiegelman suggests porcupines . When Art visits his psychiatrist , the two wear mouse masks . Spiegelman 's perceptions of the animal metaphor seem to have evolved over the book 's making — in the original publication of the first volume , his self @-@ portrait showed a mouse head on a human body , but by the time the second volume arrived , his self @-@ portrait had become that of a man wearing a mouse mask . In Maus , the characters seem to be mice and cats only in their predator / prey relationship . In every respect other than their heads and tails , they act and speak as ordinary humans . Further complicating the animal metaphor , Anja is ironically shown to be afraid of mice , while other characters appear with pet dogs and cats , and the Nazis with attack dogs . 
 = = = Memory = = = 
 To Marianne Hirsch , Spiegelman 's life is " dominated by memories that are not his own " . His work is one not of memory but of <unk> — a term she coined after encountering Maus . This describes the relation of the children of survivors with the survivors themselves . While these children have not had their parents ' experiences , they grow up with their parents ' memories — the memory of another 's memory — until the stories become so powerful that for these children they become memories in their own right . The children 's proximity creates a " deep personal connection " with the memory , though separated from it by " generational distance " . 
 Art tried to keep his father 's story chronological , because otherwise he would " never keep it straight " . His mother Anja 's memories are conspicuously absent from the narrative , given her suicide and Vladek 's destruction of her diaries . Hirsch sees Maus in part as an attempt to reconstruct her memory . Vladek keeps her memory alive with the pictures on his desk , " like a shrine " , according to Mala . 
 = = = Guilt = = = 
 Spiegelman displays his sense of guilt in many ways . He suffers anguish over his dead brother , Richieu , who perished in the Holocaust , and whom he feels he can never live up to . The eighth chapter , made after the publication and unexpected success of the first volume , opens with a guilt @-@ ridden Spiegelman ( now in human form , with a strapped @-@ on mouse mask ) atop a pile of corpses — the corpses of the six million Jews upon whom Maus 's success was built . He is told by his psychiatrist that his father feels guilt for having survived and for outliving his first son , and that some of Art 's guilt may spring from painting his father in such an unflattering way . As he had not lived in the camps himself , he finds it difficult to understand or visualize this " separate universe " , and feels inadequate in portraying it . 
 = = = Racism = = = 
 Spiegelman parodies the Nazis ' vision of racial divisions ; Vladek 's racism is also put on display when he becomes upset that Françoise would pick up a black hitchhiker , a " <unk> " as he says . When she berates him , a victim of antisemitism , for his attitude , he replies , " It 's not even to compare , the <unk> and the Jews ! " Spiegelman gradually deconstructs the animal metaphor throughout the book , especially in the second volume , showing where the lines cannot be drawn between races of humans . 
 The Germans are depicted with little difference between them , but there is great variety among the Poles and Jews who dominate the story . Sometimes Jews and the Jewish councils are shown complying with the occupiers ; some trick other Jews into capture , while others act as police for the Nazis . 
 Spiegelman shows numerous instances of Poles who risked themselves to aid Jews , and also shows antisemitism as being rife among them . The <unk> who run the camps are Poles , and Anja and Vladek are tricked by Polish smugglers into the hands of the Nazis . Anja and Vladek hear stories that Poles continue to drive off and even kill returning Jews after the war . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 Vladek 's English is broken in contrast with that of Art 's more fluent therapist , Paul Pavel , who is also an immigrant and Holocaust survivor . Vladek 's knowledge of the language helps him several times during the story , as when he uses it to meet Anja . He also uses it to befriend a Frenchman , and continues to correspond with him in English after the war . His recounting of the Holocaust , first to American soldiers , then to his son , is never in his mother tongue , and English becomes his daily language when he moves to America . His difficulty with his second language is revealed as Art writes his dialogue in broken English ; when Vladek is imprisoned he tells Art , " [ E ] very day we prayed ... I was very religious , and it wasn 't else to do " . Late in the book , Vladek talks of Dachau , saying , " And here ... my troubles began " , though clearly his troubles had begun long before Dachau . This <unk> expression was used as the subtitle of the second volume . 
 The German word <unk> is cognate to the English word " mouse " , and also reminiscent of the German word <unk> , which means " to speak like a Jew " and refers to the way Jews from Eastern Europe spoke German — a word not etymologically related to <unk> , but distantly to Moses . 
 = = Style = = 
 Spiegelman 's perceived audacity in using the Holocaust as his subject was compounded by his telling the story in comics . The prevailing view in the English @-@ speaking world held comics as inherently trivial , thus degrading Spiegelman 's subject matter , especially as he used animal heads in place of recognizably human ones . Funny animals have been a staple of comics , and while they have a traditional reputation as children 's fare , the underground had long made use of them in adult stories , for example in Robert Crumb 's Fritz the Cat , which comics critic Joseph Witek asserts shows that the genre could " open up the way to a paradoxical narrative realism " that Maus exploited . 
 Ostensibly about the Holocaust , the story <unk> with the frame tale of Art interviewing and interacting with his father . Art 's " Prisoner on the Hell Planet " is also encompassed by the frame , and stands in visual and thematical contrast with the rest of the book as the characters are in human form in a surreal , German Expressionist woodcut style inspired by Lynd Ward . 
 Spiegelman blurs the line between the frame and the world , such as when <unk> trying to deal with what Maus is becoming for him , he says to his wife , " In real life you 'd never have let me talk this long without interrupting . " When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German , Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character as a cat or a mouse . Throughout the book , Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father 's tales , sometimes humorous or ironic , giving a lightness and humanity to the story which " helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities " . 
 Spiegelman started taking down his interviews with Vladek on paper , but quickly switched to a tape recorder , face @-@ to @-@ face or over the phone . Spiegelman often condensed Vladek 's words , and occasionally added to the dialogue or synthesized multiple retellings into a single portrayal . 
 Spiegelman worried about the effect that his organizing of Vladek 's story would have on its authenticity . In the end , he eschewed a Joycean approach and settled on a linear narrative he thought would be better at " getting things across " . He strove to present how the book was recorded and organized as an integral part of the book itself , expressing the " sense of an interview shaped by a relationship " . 
 = = = Artwork = = = 
 The story is text @-@ driven , with few wordless panels in its 1 @,@ 500 black @-@ and @-@ white panels . The art has high contrast , with heavy black areas and thick black borders balanced against areas of white and wide white margins . There is little gray in the shading . In the narrative present , the pages are arranged in eight @-@ panel grids ; in the narrative past , Spiegelman found himself " violating the grid constantly " with his page layouts . 
 Spiegelman rendered the original three @-@ page " Maus " and " Prisoner on the Hell Planet " in highly detailed , expressive styles . Spiegelman planned to draw Maus in such a manner , but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared @-@ down style , one little removed from his pencil sketches , which he found more direct and immediate . Characters are rendered in a minimalist way : animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths , sitting on humanoid bodies . Spiegelman wanted to get away from the rendering of the characters in the original " Maus " , in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice , an approach which Spiegelman says , " tells you how to feel , tells you how to think " . He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments . He drew the cat @-@ Nazis the same size as the mouse @-@ Jews , and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions . The contrast between the artwork in " Prisoner on the Hell Planet " and Maus drives home the effectiveness of the simpler artwork — " Prisoner " is alienating , while Maus is more inviting , encouraging deeper contemplation and understanding . 
 Spiegelman wanted the artwork to have a diary feel to it , and so drew the pages on stationery with a fountain pen and typewriter correction fluid . It was reproduced at the same size it was drawn , unlike his other work , which was usually drawn larger and shrunk down , which hides defects in the art . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 Spiegelman has published articles promoting a greater knowledge of his medium 's history . Chief among his early influences were Harvey Kurtzman , Will Eisner , and Bernard <unk> 's " Master Race " . Though he acknowledged Eisner 's early work as an influence , he denied that Eisner 's first graphic novel , A Contract with God ( 1978 ) , had any impact on Maus . He cited Harold Gray 's comic strip Little Orphan Annie as having " influenced Maus fairly directly " , and praised Gray 's work for using a cartoon @-@ based storytelling vocabulary , rather than an illustration @-@ based one . Justin Green 's Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary ( 1972 ) inspired Spiegelman to include autobiographical elements in his comics . Spiegelman stated , " without Binky Brown , there would be no Maus " . Among the graphic artists who influenced Maus , Spiegelman cited Frans Masereel , who had made early wordless novels in woodcuts such as Passionate Journey ( 1919 ) . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Spiegelman 's work as cartoonist and editor had long been known and respected in the comics community , but the media attention after the first volume 's publication in 1986 was unexpected . Hundreds of overwhelmingly positive reviews appeared , and Maus became the center of new attention focused on comics . It was considered one of the " Big Three " book @-@ form comics from around 1986 – 1987 , along with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns , that are said to have brought the term " graphic novel " and the idea of comics for adults into mainstream consciousness . It was credited with changing the public 's perception of what comics could be at a time when , in the English @-@ speaking world , they were considered to be for children , and strongly associated with superheroes . Initially , critics of Maus showed a reluctance to include comics in literary discourse . The New York Times intended praise when saying of the book , " Art Spiegelman doesn 't draw comic books " . After its Pulitzer Prize win , it won greater acceptance and interest among academics . The Museum of Modern Art staged an exhibition on the making of Maus in 1991 – 92 . 
 Maus proved difficult to classify to a genre , and has been called biography , fiction , autobiography , history , and memoir . Spiegelman petitioned The New York Times to move it from " fiction " to " non @-@ fiction " on the newspaper 's bestseller list , saying , " I shudder to think how David Duke ... would respond to seeing a carefully researched work based closely on my father 's memories of life in Hitler 's Europe and in the death camps classified as fiction " . An editor responded , " Let 's go out to Spiegelman 's house and if a giant mouse answers the door , we 'll move it to the nonfiction side of the list ! " The Times eventually acquiesced . The Pulitzer committee sidestepped the issue by giving the completed Maus a Special Award in Letters in 1992 . 
 Maus ranked highly on comics and literature lists . The Comics Journal called it the fourth greatest comics work of the 20th century , and Wizard placed it first on their list of 100 Greatest Graphic Novels . Entertainment Weekly listed Maus at seventh place on their list of The New Classics : Books – The 100 best reads from 1983 to 2008 , and Time put Maus at seventh place on their list of best non @-@ fiction books from between 1923 and 2005 , and fourth on their list of top graphic novels . Praise for the book also came from contemporaries such as Jules Feiffer and literary writers such as Umberto Eco . Spiegelman turned down numerous offers to have Maus adapted for film or television . 
 Early instalments of Maus that appeared in Raw inspired the young Chris Ware to " try to do comics that had a ' serious ' tone to them " . Maus is cited as a primary influence on graphic novels such as Marjane Satrapi 's Persepolis and Alison Bechdel 's Fun Home . 
 In 1999 , cartoonist Ted Rall had an article published in The Village Voice criticizing Spiegelman 's prominence and influence in the New York cartooning community . Entitled " King Maus : Art Spiegelman Rules the World of Comix With Favors and Fear " , it accused the Pulitzer board of opportunism in selecting Maus , which Rall deemed unworthy . Cartoonist Danny Hellman responded to the piece with a prank email in which Hellman posed as Rall , soliciting discussion at the email address <unk> @ <unk> Hellman followed up by posting fake responses from New York magazine editors and art directors . Rall launched a lawsuit seeking damages of $ 1 @.@ 5 million for libel , breach of privacy , and causing emotional distress . To raise funds to fight the suit , in 2001 Hellman had the Legal Action Comics anthology published , which included a back cover by Spiegelman in which he depicts Rall as a urinal . 
 = = = Academic work and criticism = = = 
 A cottage industry of academic research has built up around Maus , and schools have frequently used it as course material in a range of fields : history , dysfunctional family psychology , language arts , and social studies . The volume of academic work published on Maus far surpasses that of any other work of comics . One of the earliest such works was Joshua Brown 's 1988 " Of Mice and Memory " from the Oral History Review , which deals with the problems Spiegelman faced in presenting his father 's story . Marianne Hirsch wrote an influential essay on post @-@ memory called " Family Pictures : Maus , Mourning , and Post @-@ Memory " , later expanded into a book called Family Frames : Photography , Narrative , and <unk> . Academics far outside the field of comics such as Dominick LaCapra , Linda Hutcheon , and Terrence Des Pres took part in the discourse . Few approached Maus who were familiar with comics , largely because of the lack of an academic comics tradition — Maus tended to be approached as Holocaust history or from a film or literary perspective . In 2003 , Deborah <unk> edited a collection of essays on Maus called Considering Maus : Approaches to Art Spiegelman 's " Survivor 's Tale " of the Holocaust . Maus is considered an important work of Holocaust literature , and studies of it have made significant contributions to Holocaust studies . 
 According to writer Arie Kaplan , some Holocaust survivors objected to Spiegelman making a comic book out of their tragedy . Literary critics such as Hillel Halkin objected that the animal metaphor was " doubly dehumanizing " , reinforcing the Nazi belief that the atrocities were perpetrated by one species on another , when they were actually done by humans against humans . Comics writer and critic Harvey Pekar and others saw Spiegelman 's use of animals as potentially reinforcing stereotypes . Pekar was also disdainful of Spiegelman 's overwhelmingly negative portrayal of his father , calling him disingenuous and hypocritical for such a portrayal in a book that presents itself as objective . Comics critic R. C. Harvey argued that Spiegelman 's animal metaphor threatened " to erode [ Maus 's ] moral underpinnings " , and played " directly into [ the Nazis ' ] racist vision " . 
 Commentators such as Peter Obst and Lawrence <unk> expressed concern over the Poles ' depiction as pigs , which reviewer Marek Kohn saw as an ethnic slur . Jewish culture views pigs and pork as non @-@ kosher , or unclean — a point of which the Jewish Spiegelman was unlikely to be ignorant . Critics such as Obst and Pekar have said that the portrayal of Poles is unbalanced — that , while some Poles are seen as helping Jews , they are often shown doing so for self @-@ serving reasons . In the late 1990s , an objector to Maus 's depiction of Poles interrupted a presentation by Spiegelman at Montreal 's McGill University with persistent abuse and was expelled from the auditorium . 
 Literary critic Walter Ben Michaels found Spiegelman 's racial divisions " counterfactual " . Spiegelman depicts Europeans as different animal species based on Nazi conceptions of race , but all Americans , both black and white , as dogs — with the exception of the Jews , who remain <unk> mice . To Michaels , Maus seems to gloss over the racial inequality that has plagued the history of the U.S. 
 Other critics , such as Bart Beaty , objected to what they saw as the work 's fatalism . Belgian publisher La <unk> <unk> anonymously produced a book called Katz , a remix of Spiegelman 's book with all animal heads replaced with cat heads . The book reproduced every page and line of dialogue from the French translation of Maus . Spiegelman 's French publisher , Flammarion , had the Belgian publisher destroy all copies under charges of copyright violation . 
 Scholar Paul Buhle asserted , " More than a few readers have described [ Maus ] as the most compelling of any [ Holocaust ] depiction , perhaps because only the caricatured quality of comic art is equal to the seeming unreality of an experience beyond all reason . " Michael Rothberg opined , " By situating a nonfictional story in a highly mediated , unreal , ' comic ' space , Spiegelman captures the <unk> of Auschwitz . "

 = Eugene McCarthy presidential campaign , 1968 = 
 The Eugene McCarthy presidential campaign of 1968 was launched by Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota in the latter part of 1967 to vie for 1968 Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States . The focus of his campaign was his support for a swift end to the Vietnam War through a withdrawal of American forces . The campaign appealed to youths who were tired of the establishment and dissatisfied with government . 
 Early on , McCarthy was vocal in his intent to unseat the incumbent Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson . Following McCarthy 's 42 % showing in New Hampshire , Senator Robert F. Kennedy ( D @-@ N.Y. ) entered the race . Kennedy 's entrance forced President Johnson to withdraw . After Johnson 's withdrawal , Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey entered the contest but avoided the primaries . 
 Kennedy fought it out with McCarthy in the primaries , as Humphrey used favorite son stand @-@ ins to help him win delegates to the Democratic National Convention . Kennedy was assassinated , leaving Humphrey as McCarthy 's main challenger . But Humphrey 's organization was too strong for McCarthy to overcome , and his anti @-@ war campaign was split after the late entrance of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota just ahead of the Democratic National Convention . Despite winning the popular vote , McCarthy lost to Humphrey at the convention amidst protests and riots . 
 = = Background = = 
 Eugene McCarthy was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1948 as a member of the Minnesota Democratic – Farmer – Labor Party . He served five terms before winning a seat in the United States Senate in 1958 . His speech at the 1960 Democratic National Convention in support of Adlai Stevenson placed him on the national stage . President Johnson considered selecting him as his running mate in 1964 , but instead chose fellow Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota . McCarthy vehemently opposed the Vietnam War . 
 Months prior to his announcement , McCarthy hinted that he would challenge President Johnson for the Democratic nomination due to his contrasting views with the president on the Vietnam War . The Americans for Democratic Action announced that they would support McCarthy 's campaign if he decided to run . Johnson took these mentions seriously , privately confiding to Democratic congressional leaders that McCarthy could gain the support of Martin Luther King , Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock , splintering the party . It was rumored that McCarthy had $ 100 @,@ 000 pledged to use on the New Hampshire and Wisconsin primaries in the upcoming year . One politician explained to Johnson that McCarthy 's run could be reminiscent of Estes Kefauver , whose 1952 campaign in the early primaries is speculated to have caused President Harry S. Truman to not seek re @-@ election . McCarthy privately explained his intentions to Vice President Hubert Humphrey with whom he had served Minnesota in the Senate for nearly two decades . He commented that he did not believe he could win , but that he had " lost interest " in the Senate and felt " very strongly about the war , " believing that the best way to express himself was to " go on out and enter the primaries . " Humphrey stated that McCarthy was " more vain and arrogant than his supporters wanted to admit " , but that he did not decide to run for president because of his personal feelings for Johnson , but his genuine feelings about the Vietnam War . 
 = = Challenging the incumbent = = 
 Citing the importance of preventing President Johnson 's nomination , and the continuation of the war in Vietnam , McCarthy entered his name into four Democratic presidential primaries on November 30 , 1967 . Upon his entrance , the Senator articulated that he believed there was a " deepening moral crisis " in America with the rejection of the political system by citizens , and a helplessness he hoped to alleviate as president . A few days later , the Johnson administration made an announcement on the war in Vietnam that , according to McCarthy , was akin to an escalation . He believed that such an announcement would only strengthen his own campaign . The following week , rumors spread among the president 's staff that the McCarthy campaign was a ploy to weaken Johnson and make it easier for Senator Robert F. Kennedy to defeat him . Kennedy had announced that he would not challenge Johnson for the nomination , but a presidential candidacy was not ruled out . 
 McCarthy began January by making no promises about a potential challenge of the president on the Florida primary ballot , but reaffirmed his goal to defeat the president in New Hampshire . The next day , he appeared as the first guest of the half @-@ hour ABC news series Issues and Answers , and discussed his views on pertinent campaign issues . He claimed the North Vietnamese government was willing to negotiate , and that any further bombing should be halted to forge an end to the hostilities . As President Johnson prepared for his annual State of the Union Address , McCarthy requested equal time from television networks after the president discussed the McCarthy @-@ Kennedy conspiracy theory the previous month . The request was rejected . Later in the month , McCarthy delivered a speech in front of 6 @,@ 500 students at University Park , Pennsylvania , that criticized the Johnson administration for being " afraid to negotiate " with the North Vietnamese . This came as Robert Kennedy commented that he would support Johnson as the nominee , even though his views more closely resembled McCarthy 's , predicting that the campaign would have a " healthy influence " on Johnson , whom he picked to ultimately win the nomination . Near the end of January , McCarthy campaigned in St. Louis , where he continued his anti @-@ war rhetoric , describing the Vietnam War as against " American tradition " and declared that " no nation has a right " to " destroy a nation " with the rationale of " nation building . " He then discussed his support for normalized relations with Cuba . After seven weeks of campaigning , McCarthy concluded that his speeches were coming across more as poetry than substantive campaign messages . As he traveled through California , a stop in Stanford was greeted by newspaper headlines that asked the candidate whether he " want [ ed ] to make righteous speeches ... or end the Viet Nam War . " As his candidacy continued , McCarthy and his staffers worked to improve the campaign 's " passion gap . " 
 = = = Primary campaign begins = = = 
 As McCarthy planned to visit Miami , Florida , Democratic bigwigs decided to stage their own rally in the state . It was unclear if the plan had developed from the White House , but diversionary tactics were used to take away attention from a McCarthy appearance when establishment Democrats scheduled a meeting of their own on the same days in Tallahassee . The purpose of McCarthy 's visit was to campaign and begin discussion about the presidential nominating slate for the May 28 Florida primary . He discussed civil rights during the trip , remarking that " it would take 30 to 50 years of constant action and concern to carry out all promises to the emancipated Negro who has been treated as a colonial people in America . " Following the speech , the Conference of Concerned Democrats unanimously decided to award him pledged delegates from the state of Florida . Meanwhile , an anonymous poll showed that no members of Congress described McCarthy as the strongest candidate for the Democratic nomination , with the majority naming President Johnson . However , he gained the endorsement of the Americans for Democratic Action , who failed to support an incumbent Democratic president for the first time in 20 years . Later on , McCarthy announced that he would take part in the Pennsylvania primary , turning in 3 @,@ 400 signatures on the filing deadline . 
 The month of March kicked off with charges from the media that McCarthy 's campaign was just dragging along . Cited was his tardiness to the Senate floor , which failed to prevent a Southern filibuster against a civil rights bill drafted by fellow Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale . Despite the setback , three precincts in Minnesota elected McCarthy supported delegates to caucuses , to the detriment of Vice @-@ President Hubert Humphrey , and President Johnson decided to abandon Massachusetts , giving 72 delegates to McCarthy . He described the news as " encouraging . " At this point , McCarthy had spent a large amount of time campaigning in New Hampshire , hoping to improve his standing before the state 's critical primary . Meanwhile , President Johnson 's campaign circulated the slogan that " the communists in Vietnam are watching the New Hampshire primary ... don 't vote for fuzzy thinking and surrender . " McCarthy likened this statement to McCarthyism , a reference to Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin . Opinion polls prior to the New Hampshire primary showed that McCarthy 's support stood at only 10 to 20 percent . Although he did not win the contest , he stunned spectators of the race by winning a surprising 42 @.@ 2 percent of the vote to Johnson 's 49 @.@ 4 percent . Media outlets described the results as a " moral victory " for McCarthy , and influenced Robert Kennedy 's decision to enter the race on March 16 . Kennedy 's announcement did not affect McCarthy 's campaign . He remained committed to the " young people " who had supported his campaign all along , and remarked that he was " better qualified to run for the presidency " than Kennedy . McCarthy set his sights on Wisconsin and began to prepare for the state 's April primary . He ran advertisements in newspapers throughout the state and included his platform . In it , he called for " more federal aid for education , " collective bargaining rights for farmers , " a guaranteed minimum livable income for all Americans , " the construction of " at least one million new housing units each year , and more " federal funds to stop pollution . " While in Wisconsin , he criticized the government of South Vietnam , saying that it would be " too kind " to label the entity as corrupt and a dictatorship . He then announced his intentions to enter the primaries in Indiana and Florida , and hoped to compete in California in the upcoming months . On March 31 , President Johnson made the surprise announcement that he was dropping out of the race and would not seek to be renominated for the presidency .

 Since President Johnson had dropped out immediately prior to the Wisconsin Primary , McCarthy easily won although he did not face his new challenger , Robert Kennedy , who was ineligible for the ballot because he entered the race following the filing deadline . Polls suggested that McCarthy benefited the most from Johnson 's withdrawal , reached 22 percent among the Democratic field , up eleven points , and two behind the still @-@ undeclared Humphrey and fifteen behind Kennedy . He traveled to Pennsylvania later in the month , to prepare for the state 's primary in late April . While there , he discussed North Korea 's seizing of the USS Pueblo , stating that the United States should " expect once in awhile [ sic ? ] to pay ransom ... if you have ships adjacent to countries that don 't respect international law . " He clarified that he was not suggesting that the ransom should be paid , and agreed that President Johnson 's use of negotiation was correct . He then compared his record of service to Kennedy , articulating that his accomplishments on civil rights paralleled a longer period of time than the senator . On April 23 , McCarthy won the Pennsylvania Primary , receiving more votes than Kennedy , whose name did not appear on the ballot but ran as a write @-@ in candidate . 
 The next month , McCarthy took advantage of Robert Kennedy 's decline in the polls , trailing the former frontrunner by two points for second place in the race behind Vice President Humphrey . At the time , polls suggested that McCarthy was more likely than his Democratic rivals to defeat Republican frontrunner Richard Nixon in a head to head matchup , leading 40 to 37 percent in a Harris poll . While campaigning in South Bend , Indiana prior to the state 's primary , McCarthy criticized the approach of his two closest Democratic rivals . He stated that there were three kinds of national unity ; Humphrey 's approach of " run [ <unk> ] things together indiscriminately , " Kennedy 's approach of a " combination of separate interests ... or groups , " and his own approach of " call [ ing ] upon everyone ... to be as fully responsible as [ they ] can be , " which the candidate labeled as the approach for 1968 . McCarthy lost in Indiana but received 27 percent of the vote to Kennedy 's 42 percent . Four days later , McCarthy received the most votes in Time Magazine 's national presidential primary . The poll counted votes of over 1 million students in more than 1 @,@ 200 campuses . Kennedy came in second , trailing by more than 70 @,@ 000 votes . In regards to the results , McCarthy commented , " We 've tested the enemy now , and we know his techniques ... we know his weaknesses . " The next day , Kennedy defeated McCarthy in the Nebraska primary but it did not stall his effort . He reaffirmed that he would compete with Kennedy in Oregon , California and South Dakota . He ended the month by defeating Kennedy in the Oregon primary by a margin of 45 to 39 percent . The victory allowed for the media to observe that McCarthy was " back in the race as a major contender . " and forced an attention shift to the looming primaries in South Dakota and California , scheduled for the next month . 
 = = = A turn for the worse = = = 
 McCarthy and Kennedy vigorously campaigned throughout California in the beginning of June , with the latter announcing he would exit the race if he lost the state 's primary . The two candidates each appeared in televised forums , which McCarthy criticized for not being in a debate format . On June 5 , Robert Kennedy was shot in Los Angeles after winning both the California and South Dakota primaries . McCarthy immediately canceled his campaign plans and was placed under heavy guard in his hotel . Kennedy died the next day , shifting a large number of his delegates to Humphrey while popular opinion seemed to shift to McCarthy . McCarthy was grief @-@ stricken from the event , and considered dropping out of the race . Following Kennedy 's funeral , McCarthy privately met with both Johnson and Humphrey to discuss the future of the Democratic Party . Later in the month , Republican Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon , assessed the Democratic situation , stating that McCarthy did not have a chance and that Humphrey would be the party 's nominee . 
 With the primaries wrapped up , McCarthy spent July attempting to woo uncommitted delegates and clarify his positions on the issues . He continued a strong anti @-@ war sentiment , mentioning that he might travel to Paris , France to discuss peace with the North Vietnamese . Chief negotiators called the potential trip a mistake , and that the talks were too important " to interject partisan politics . " Next , the candidate was cited by the emergency committee for gun control chair John Glenn as being one of five presidential candidates that endorsed the group 's movement to control firearms . McCarthy argued for a national registration of handguns , and the development of a system to sell mail order guns only to qualified individuals . But argued that the sale of shotguns and rifles , should be left to the discretion of individual states . The next week , he proposed a " war on hunger " to help the millions of Americans he claimed were starving , commenting that " our first concern is the health of each hungry individual . " The Department of Agriculture disputed his claims on the matter . Six days later , McCarthy made his way to Georgia , where he sought additional Democratic delegates to counter Vice President Humphrey 's strong organization . The previous day , he had visited Pittsburgh and attended a rally that he hoped would gain Pennsylvania 's Democratic delegates and the African @-@ American vote . McCarthy challenged Humphrey to a series of debates on an assortment of issues . The Vice @-@ President accepted the invitation but modified the proposal by requesting there be only one debate prior to the Democratic National Convention . As the month ended , and with the Democratic Convention speedily approaching , McCarthy tried to change a few rules of the convention , focusing a great deal on " unit voting " rule , which gave party bosses more control . The tactics were meant to compensate for Humphrey 's delegate lead , and were previously used by Dwight Eisenhower in his successful 1952 campaign , while battling Robert A. Taft for the Republican nomination . 
 = = = Democratic Party National Convention = = = 
 McCarthy 's plan to gain more delegates was complicated when Senator George McGovern of South Dakota entered the race as the successor to the legacy of Robert Kennedy . The entrance had the effect of splitting the anti @-@ Humphrey vote . Meanwhile , the McCarthy campaign alleged that Democratic National Chairman John Bailey was giving preferential treatment to Humphrey , to the detriment of McCarthy . They asked for the chairman 's resignation , but he rejected the claims and argued that the two candidates were receiving " exactly the same treatment in hotel space , amphitheatre space , telephone service , tickets , transportation and every other phase of convention activity . " As the eve of the convention dawned , Humphrey appeared to hold a lead over McCarthy among the delegates with McGovern in a distant third , but with many delegates still uncommitted , the three men battled it out . Meanwhile , on the streets of Chicago , anti @-@ war protests raged as 6 @,@ 000 federal troops and 18 @,@ 000 Illinois National Guard defended the premises of the convention . Humphrey won the nomination on the first ballot , despite the fact that McCarthy had won a plurality of the primary vote . Riots intensified , and supporters of McCarthy urged the candidate to run a fourth party campaign against Nixon , Humphrey and George Wallace . He announced that he would not run such a campaign , and stepped down while denying an endorsement to Humphrey . At the end of his campaign , McCarthy stated that he " set out to prove ... that the people of this country could be educated and make a decent judgment ... but evidently this is something the politicians were afraid to face up to . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 McCarthy 's refusal to endorse Humphrey wavered somewhat by October , as the former candidate laid out conditions for the Democratic nominee . These included a shift in his stance on the Vietnam War , a change of the military draft , and a reform of the Democratic machine politics . Humphrey discussed the demands with McCarthy via telephone , and responded that he was " not prone to start meeting conditions , " but that he is stating his " own case " as a candidate . At the end of October , McCarthy announced that he would vote for Humphrey , but would go no further than that . Nixon eventually won the election , and McCarthy received 20 @,@ 721 write @-@ in votes in California. and 2 @,@ 751 in Arizona , where he was listed as the nominee of the anti @-@ war " New Party . " McCarthy also ran for the Democratic nomination in 1972 , but soon dropped out . He mounted independent campaign in 1976 and received over 700 thousand votes . During the 1980s , McCarthy was a supporter of the Reagan administration , and tried once again for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 1992 . He died on December 10 , 2005 at the age of 89 . 
 = Harmon Killebrew = 
 Harmon Clayton Killebrew ( / <unk> / ; June 29 , 1936 – May 17 , 2011 ) , nicknamed " The Killer " and " <unk> ' Harmon " , was an American professional baseball first baseman , third baseman , and left fielder . During his 22 @-@ year career in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , primarily with the Minnesota Twins , Killebrew was a prolific power hitter who , at the time of his retirement , was second only to Babe Ruth in American League ( AL ) home runs and was the AL career leader in home runs by a right @-@ handed batter ( since broken by Alex Rodriguez ) . He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984 . 
 Killebrew was a stocky 5 @-@ foot @-@ 11 @-@ inch ( 180 cm ) tall , 213 @-@ pound ( 97 kg ) hitter with a compact swing that generated tremendous power . He became one of the AL 's most feared power hitters of the 1960s , hitting 40 home runs in a season eight times . In 1965 , he played in the World Series with the Twins , who lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers . His finest season was 1969 , when he hit 49 home runs , recorded 140 runs batted in ( RBIs ) , and won the AL Most Valuable Player Award . Killebrew led the league six times in home runs and three times in RBIs , and was named to eleven All @-@ Star teams . 
 With quick hands and exceptional upper @-@ body strength , Killebrew was known not just for the frequency of his home runs but also for their distance . He hit the longest measured home runs at Minnesota 's Metropolitan Stadium , 520 ft ( 160 m ) , and Baltimore 's Memorial Stadium , 471 ft ( 144 m ) , and was the first of just four batters to hit a baseball over the left field roof at Detroit 's Tiger Stadium . Despite his nicknames and his powerful style of play , Killebrew was considered by his colleagues to be a quiet , kind man . Asked once what hobbies he had , Killebrew replied , " Just washing the dishes , I guess . " 
 After retiring from baseball , Killebrew became a television broadcaster for several baseball teams from 1976 to 1988 , and also served as a hitting instructor for the Oakland Athletics . He also divorced and remarried during this time , moving to Arizona in 1990 and chairing the Harmon Killebrew Foundation . Killebrew was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in December 2010 , and died five months later . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born in Payette , Idaho on June 29 , 1936 , Harmon Killebrew was youngest of four children to Harmon Clayton , Sr. and Katherine Pearl ( May ) Killebrew . His father , a painter and sheriff , was a member of an undefeated Millikin College football team who was later named an All @-@ American under eventual Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Greasy Neale . According to family legend , Harmon Killebrew 's grandfather was the strongest man in the Union Army , winning every available heavyweight wrestling championship . Clayton encouraged Harmon and his brothers to stay active in various sports before his sudden death in 1953 at age 59 . 
 As a child , Harmon played baseball at Walter Johnson Memorial Field , named after the Hall of Fame pitcher who spent part of his childhood in Idaho . He worked as a farmworker in his youth , where he lifted 10 @-@ gallon milk cans , each can weighing about 95 lb ( 43 kg ) . Killebrew earned 12 letters in various sports and was named an All @-@ American quarterback at Payette High School ; his uniform number was later retired by the school . He was offered an athletic scholarship by the University of Oregon , but declined the offer . 
 In the early 1950s , Idaho Senator Herman Welker told Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith about Killebrew , who was hitting for an <unk> batting average for a semi @-@ professional baseball team at the time . Griffith told his farm director Ossie Bluege about the tip and Bluege flew to Idaho to watch Killebrew play . The Boston Red Sox also expressed interest but Bluege succeeded in signing him to a $ 50 @,@ 000 ( $ 440 @,@ 582 today ) contract on June 19 , 1954 .

 Killebrew signed his contract under Major League Baseball ( MLB ) ' s Bonus Rule , which required that he spend two full seasons on the major league roster . Making his major league debut four days after signing and six days from his 18th birthday ( becoming the youngest active player in the majors at the time ) , Killebrew was called on to run for Clyde Vollmer , who had been hit by a pitch , with the bases loaded , by Chicago White Sox starter Jack Harshman while pinch hitting for Senators reliever Chuck <unk> . On August 23 , 1954 , Killebrew made his first start in the second game of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Athletics , hitting two singles and a double as the Senators won the game , 10 – 3 . A year and one day after making his major league debut , Killebrew hit his first major league home run on June 24 , 1955 in the 5th inning off Detroit Tigers starter Billy Hoeft , five days shy of his 19th birthday . In his first two seasons , Killebrew struck out 34 times in only 93 at bats , contributing to a .215 batting average with four home runs . Killebrew also had defensive difficulties at third base , where he played behind veteran Eddie Yost . 
 When Killebrew 's bonus period expired in 1956 , he was sent to the Senators ' minor league affiliate in Charlotte of the South Atlantic League . He returned to the majors in early May . On May 29 , after being forced into action when regular second baseman Pete Runnels was injured early in the game , Killebrew hit two home runs in the game , including only the second ball ever hit over a wire barrier in Memorial Stadium 's center field . Killebrew had a .115 average through June 16 , and as a result was sent back to Charlotte ; he finished the season there with a .325 batting average and 15 home runs in 70 games . Killebrew spent most of the 1957 season with the Southern Association 's Chattanooga Lookouts , where he hit a league @-@ high 29 home runs with 101 RBIs and was named to the All @-@ Star Game . While in Chattanooga , Killebrew became the only player to hit a home run over the center field wall at Engel Stadium , 471 feet ( 144 m ) from home plate . In 1958 , he was briefly promoted to Indianapolis of the American Association but struggled and was sent back to Chattanooga for most of the season . Killebrew finished the season with 38 games played in Indianapolis and 86 in Chattanooga , where he hit .308 with 17 home runs . He also played a combined 22 games for the Senators in 1957 and 1958 . 
 Calvin Griffith took over the Senators after his uncle Clark Griffith died in 1955 , and decided Killebrew was ready to become the Senators ' regular third baseman . Griffith traded the 32 @-@ year @-@ old Eddie Yost to the Detroit Tigers on December 6 , 1958 , and Killebrew became the starting third baseman . From May 1 to May 17 , he had five multi @-@ home run games and his first five @-@ RBI game on May 12 . With 28 home runs by mid @-@ season , he started the first 1959 All @-@ Star Game and was a reserve in the second . Killebrew attracted so much attention in Washington that he was visited by President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower , who frequently attended games , and Griffith turned down a $ 500 @,@ 000 offer for Killebrew from the Cincinnati Reds . Killebrew finished the season with 42 home runs to tie for the American League lead ; it also tied the Senator 's single @-@ season record set by his teammate Roy Sievers two years earlier . Although 1959 proved his breakout season , he was ineligible for the Rookie of the Year Award because of his previous sparse experience . Instead , the award went to teammate Bob Allison . 
 Killebrew was bothered by injury early in the 1960 season . In March , he had surgery for nasal irritation , and a recurring hamstring injury caused him to miss most of May . On his return , he remained in the lineup for the rest of the season , finishing the year with 31 home runs in 124 games . Killebrew 's arrival and home runs did little to improve the Senators ' record , as they finished in the second division of the American League every year he played for Washington , including four years in last place . Following the 1960 season , the Senators moved to Minnesota and became the Minnesota Twins . 
 = = = Minnesota Twins = = = 
 = = = = 1961 – 1965 = = = = 
 For the franchise 's first year in Minnesota , Killebrew was named team captain by manager Cookie Lavagetto . He responded by hitting 46 home runs , breaking the franchise record he had tied two years earlier . Among his other accomplishments over the course of the season , Killebrew accumulated a team @-@ leading 122 RBIs , achieved a career @-@ best batting average of .288 and had a slugging percentage of over .600 for the only time in his career . In addition , he had a career @-@ high seven triples , tying for the team lead , and led his team in runs , total bases and walks . On June 12 , 1961 , Killebrew had the only five @-@ hit game of his career in a losing effort by the Twins . Killebrew was named to both 1961 All @-@ Star games . He did not play in the second game , but in the first game , he hit a pinch hit home run in the sixth inning . After the season ended , Killebrew took part in a home run hitting contest with Jim Gentile and Roger Maris , whose 61 home runs that year broke the single @-@ season record ; Killebrew hit 20 to win the contest . 
 After his seven @-@ triple season , his speed began to decrease and he could no longer regularly score triples due to pulling his quadriceps during the 1962 season . Killebrew moved to left field , where he started off the season slowly . He hit under .200 in both April and June , and because of this Killebrew was not selected to play in either 1962 All @-@ Star Game , the last season he was not named an All @-@ Star before 1972 . On July 18 in a game against the Cleveland Indians , Killebrew and Bob Allison became the first teammates since 1890 to hit grand slams in the same inning as the Twins scored 11 runs in the first . Over the course of the season , Killebrew hit 48 home runs , 126 RBIs , and had 107 walks , all career highs at the time . No one else in the AL managed even 40 home runs and he also led the league in RBIs . Killebrew 's 48 home runs also broke the franchise record for the second year in a row . Not all of his stats were positive ; Killebrew 's batting average dropped from .288 in 1961 to .243 and he struck out a career @-@ worst 142 times , leading the AL . 
 Killebrew 's efforts were rewarded in 1963 when he agreed to a contract for about $ 40 @,@ 000 ( $ 309 @,@ 174 today ) . He started the season off slowly , and he missed the second half of April and early May due to a right knee injury that was slow to heal . Killebrew continued his hitting prowess for the Twins upon his return , and at one point led them on a six @-@ game winning streak . On September 21 , Killebrew hit three home runs in a game for the only time in his career in the first game of a doubleheader against the Boston Red Sox . Killebrew finished the season with a .258 batting average , 45 home runs , and 96 RBI , and led the league in home runs and slugging percentage ( .555 ) . He had surgery on his troublesome right knee after the season ended . 
 Having played left field for the previous three years with a below @-@ average throwing arm , the additional complication of Killebrew 's knee surgery necessitated a move to the infield . For the remainder of his career , he played only 19 games in the outfield . He finished the 1964 season with a .270 batting average , 49 home runs , and 111 RBI ; he led the AL in home runs for the third consecutive year . 
 The Twins finally won the American League pennant during the 1965 season . On July 11 , the day before the All @-@ Star break , defending AL champion Yankees had a one @-@ run lead over the Twins going into the bottom of the 9th inning , but Killebrew hit a two @-@ run home run for the win . Two days later , Killebrew started the All @-@ Star Game at his home field , Metropolitan Stadium , and hit a game @-@ tying two @-@ run home run , erasing what had been a 5 – 0 National League lead . Elected to play first base on his fifth All @-@ Star team , Killebrew became the first player in All @-@ Star game history to be elected at three different positions , having previously been selected to play third base ( 1959 and 1961 ) and left field ( 1963 and 1964 ) . 
 Killebrew drove in the tying or winning run seven times in 1965 before suffering an injury on August 2 . During a game against the Orioles , Twins third baseman Rich Rollins made a poor throw to first and while trying to save the play , Killebrew collided with the runner and dislocated his elbow , putting him out of action until mid @-@ September . Despite his absence , the Twins had a win @-@ loss record of 28 – 19 and even extended their first place lead . Killebrew ended the regular season with 25 home runs and 75 RBI , his lowest numbers in a full season due to the injury . In the 1965 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers , Killebrew and <unk> <unk> led the Twins with .286 batting averages , and Killebrew hit a home run off Don Drysdale in Game 4 . Overall , Minnesota was shut out in three games and the Dodgers won the series in seven games . 
 = = = = 1966 – 1969 = = = = 
 At the start of the 1966 season , Killebrew hit a few home runs ; halfway through May , he had only hit two home runs , his lowest total at that point of a season since 1960 , when he had missed the first two months of the season . He later increased his tally to 39 and finished the season with a .281 batting average and 110 RBIs . He led the AL with 103 walks and finished 4th in Most Valuable Player Award ( MVP ) voting to Frank Robinson , Brooks Robinson , and Boog Powell . 
 During the 1967 season , Killebrew showed his ability to hit long home runs when , on June 3 , 1967 , he struck the longest home run recorded at Metropolitan Stadium , a shot off Lew Burdette in the 4th inning that landed in the second deck of the bleachers . The Twins , led by Killebrew , were in the pennant race throughout the season , and had a one @-@ game lead as the final two games of the season began against the Boston Red Sox . Having to win only once to clinch the pennant , Killebrew hit a home run in the first game and recorded two hits in each game , but Boston won twice and Minnesota finished in a second place tie with the Detroit Tigers . Killebrew finished the season with a .269 batting average and 113 RBIs , and led the AL with 44 home runs and 131 walks . He also finished a distant second in MVP voting to Boston 's Triple Crown winner Carl Yastrzemski . 
 Killebrew started the 1968 season in a different venue ; he served as a prosecution witness in a case where his name was being used to sell stocks in Idaho , unknown to him . Despite this , the season was unsuccessful for Killebrew , whose batting average barely passed .200 most of the year ; after a strong start , he hit below .200 in both May and June and his average stood at .204 with 13 home runs going into the all @-@ star break . Even so , he was selected as the starting first baseman in the All @-@ Star Game and Killebrew stated that , owing to his poor start , he was " surprised " and " embarrassed " by the selection . In the All @-@ Star Game itself , in the third inning he stretched for a ball thrown by shortstop Jim Fregosi and his foot slipped and he did the splits , rupturing his left medial hamstring . He was carried from the field by a stretcher . At the time , the injury was considered career @-@ threatening , but after missing about six weeks , he returned to limited action in September . 
 After enduring seven months of rehabilitation for his injury , Killebrew remained in pain but rebounded to have his best season in 1969 . On July 5 , Killebrew set a career @-@ high with six RBIs in a game against the Oakland Athletics . That personal best lasted barely two months : on September 7 he hit a three @-@ run home run and a grand slam for seven RBIs , all in the first two innings , to defeat the Athletics again . Killebrew led the best offense in the league and rookie manager Billy Martin 's Twins won the new American League West division as a result . 
 For the season , Killebrew set career highs in RBIs , runs , walks and on @-@ base percentage , tied his career high with 49 home runs , and even registered eight of his 19 career stolen bases , en route to winning his only Most Valuable Player Award . He led the AL in home runs , RBIs , on @-@ base percentage , walks , and intentional walks and knocked in the winning run 20 times while playing in all 162 games . As of 2011 , Killebrew 's home run , RBI , and walk totals from 1969 remain team records , and his 145 walks are tied for the 20th highest single season total in MLB history and 7th highest for a right @-@ handed batter . In the 1969 American League Championship Series , the Baltimore Orioles used their pitching staff , the best in the league , to defeat Minnesota and win the series three games to none . Baltimore avoided Killebrew by walking him six times in the three games to avoid pitching to him , which was as many times as they walked the rest of the Twins team . 
 = = = = 1970 – 1974 = = = = 
 After his MVP season , Killebrew signed a new contract with the Twins worth $ 90 @,@ 000 ( $ 548 @,@ 406 today ) . He was set to lead a team that had undergone a lot of change ; Killebrew was one of only four Twins remaining from the 1965 pennant @-@ winning club . He spent most of the season 's first half continuing his success , and found Baltimore 's Brooks Robinson rivalling him for the third base spot during the All @-@ Star voting process ; the two were neck @-@ and @-@ neck throughout . He continued his success through the second half of the year , and at season 's end Killebrew had hit 41 home runs with 113 RBIs and finished third in MVP voting behind teammate Tony Oliva and Baltimore 's Boog Powell , who won the award . The Twins again faced Powell and the Orioles in the 1970 American League Championship Series , a rematch of the previous season . The Twins were again swept , though Killebrew 's performance improved as he hit two home runs in three games . 
 Killebrew reached the 40 home runs for the final time in 1970 and also made his last appearance in the postseason . His contract continued to grow in value though , and before the 1971 season began he was awarded the first $ 100 @,@ 000 ( $ 584 @,@ 306 today ) contract in Twins ' history . Killebrew appeared in his last All @-@ Star Game in 1971 , hitting a two @-@ run home run off Ferguson Jenkins to provide the margin of victory for the AL . He finished the season with a .254 batting average , 114 walks , 119 RBI , the latter two of which led the league , and 28 home runs . Killebrew hit his <unk> home run on June 22 , 1971 , but a sprained right toe made his run to milestone number 500 a slow one . He hit number 499 more than a month later and finally hit number 500 off a Mike Cuellar slow curveball in the first inning of an August 10 home game ; at the time , he was the 10th player in history to hit 500 home runs . He then wasted no time in hitting number 501 , knocking a Cuellar fastball over the fences later in the same game . 
 In 1972 , Killebrew showed signs of slowing down . He missed his first All @-@ Star Game since 1962 , but instead of expressing disappointment in his streak ending , he noted that Twins shortstop Danny Thompson should have had the opportunity to play instead ; Thompson mentioned the same thing about Killebrew . Despite not making the team , Killebrew 's home run total continued to climb , and by the end of July he had Jimmie Foxx and Mickey Mantle career marks in his sights ; he went on to pass both in August . Killebrew finished the season with a .231 batting average , 26 home runs , and 74 RBIs . There were questions about Killebrew 's health as the 1973 season began , as he had surgery twice during the offseason to fix leg problems . He played through the first half of the season , but an injury to his left knee on June 25 sidelined him . A month later , the injury had not cleared up , and he underwent surgery to remove some torn cartilage ; he did not return to the lineup until mid @-@ September . Killebrew only played in 69 games that season , hitting five home runs . 
 Fully recovered for the 1974 season , Killebrew made his mark early on , hitting two home runs in a May 5 match against the Detroit Tigers ; the second was career home run number 550 . In his honor , the Twins held a Harmon Killebrew Day in August , where it was announced that they would retire his number ; Killebrew responded by leading the Twins to a 5 – 4 victory over the Orioles . He finished the season with a .222 batting average , 13 home runs , and 54 RBIs . In December 1974 , he was given the option of staying with the Twins as a coach and batting instructor , managing the AAA Tacoma Twins , or being released . He chose to be released , ending his 21 @-@ season tenure with the Twins . 
 = = = Kansas City Royals = = = 
 On January 24 , 1975 , eight days after getting his release from the Twins , Killebrew signed a one @-@ year contract with the Kansas City Royals . During his return to Minnesota in early May , the Twins formally retired his No. 3 jersey . In that game , Killebrew hit a home run against his former teammates and received a standing ovation from the crowd . In 106 games with the Royals , he had a batting average of <unk> , 14 home runs , and 44 RBIs . At the end of the season , the Royals decided to release Killebrew . In March 1976 , he formally announced his retirement and stated that he would become an announcer and color commentator for Twins games . At the time of his retirement , he was fifth all @-@ time on the home run list .

 Killebrew was first eligible for the Hall of Fame in 1981 and received 239 votes , or 59 @.@ 6 % of the vote ; 75 % of the vote is required for induction . While he did hit 573 home runs ( 5th all @-@ time when he left the game ) , he amassed a relatively low hit total ( 2086 ) , given the years he played , combined with a high number of strikeouts ( 1699 ) , and a .256 batting average . In 1982 , Killebrew received 59 @.@ 3 % of the vote , taking a backseat to Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson , who made it in their first year of eligibility . After receiving 71 @.@ 9 % of the vote in 1983 , Killebrew said that not getting in that year was more difficult to accept than the previous two times , and asked " Why do the writers feel there only has to be a certain number inducted each time ? " In 1984 , Killebrew received 83 @.@ 1 % of the vote and was elected to the Hall in his fourth year of eligibility , joining Luis Aparicio and Don Drysdale as <unk> . 
 Following his retirement , Killebrew was a television broadcaster for the Twins at <unk> TV from 1976 to 1978 , the Oakland Athletics from 1979 to 1982 , the California Angels in 1983 and back with Minnesota from 1984 to 1988 . While with Oakland , he also served as a <unk> and minor @-@ league hitting instructor . In the late 1980s , Killebrew had financial problems . In July 1988 , his house went into foreclosure and , in 1989 , the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that he had fallen $ 700 @,@ 000 into debt . He also divorced his first wife of over 30 years , Elaine , who he had married in 1955 . Soon after , Killebrew 's health failed . In May 1990 , he was rushed to the hospital with a collapsed lung and damaged esophagus . Together with a subsequent abscess and staph infection , Killebrew endured three surgeries and nearly died . He used a wheelchair for some time post @-@ surgery . By December 1990 , his health was improved and he was remarried to Nita . 
 Killebrew was involved in a Boise , Idaho insurance and securities business . He moved to Scottsdale , Arizona in 1990 , where he chaired the Harmon Killebrew Foundation , which he created in 1998 . Killebrew founded the Danny Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament in 1977 with former Idaho congressman Ralph Harding , which is played annually in late August in Sun Valley , Idaho , and has donated more than $ 8 @.@ 6 million to leukemia and cancer research . Thompson was a Twins teammate who continued his major league career while suffering from leukemia ; he died in December 1976 at the age of 29 . 
 On December 29 , 2010 , Killebrew announced that he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and started treatment . On May 13 , 2011 , a Minnesota Twins press release reported he was ceasing treatment and entering hospice care , because his illness had progressed beyond his doctors ' expectation of cure . To honor Killebrew , the Twins wore their 1961 throwback alternate jerseys at home for the remainder of the 2011 season ; he was also honored by the Washington Nationals , who hung a jersey with Killebrew 's name and number 3 in their home dugout . Killebrew died on May 17 , 2011 at his home in Scottsdale , Arizona at the age of 74 , a month and a half short of his 75th birthday . He was interred at Riverside Cemetery in Payette , Idaho . Following his death , the Twins released a statement : 
 No individual has ever meant more to the Minnesota Twins organization and millions of fans across Twins Territory than Harmon Killebrew . Harmon will long be remembered as one of the most prolific home run hitters in the history of the game and the leader of a group of players who helped lay the foundation for the long @-@ term success of the Twins franchise and Major League Baseball in the Upper Midwest . However , more importantly Harmon 's legacy will be the class , dignity and humility he demonstrated each and every day as a Hall of Fame @-@ quality husband , father , friend , teammate and man .

 Despite his nicknames and style of play , Killebrew was considered by his colleagues to be a quiet , kind man . While still an active major leaguer , Killebrew became a Mormon , and never smoked or drank . He was once asked in an interview what hobbies he had , to which he replied , " Just washing the dishes , I guess . " In his career , Killebrew hit 573 home runs , which as of 2015 is currently 11th all @-@ time , 1 @,@ 584 RBIs , 1 @,@ 559 walks , which is currently 15th all @-@ time , and he easily holds the all @-@ time home run record among players born in the state of Idaho with 573 ; Vance Law is second with 71 . He also finished with the record of having the most plate appearances ( 9 @,@ 831 ) in his career without a sacrifice hit ( since broken by Frank Thomas with 10 @,@ 074 plate appearances ) . 
 The street along the south side of the Mall of America , the former site of Metropolitan Stadium , in Bloomington , Minnesota was named " Killebrew Drive " in his honor . Banners that hung above the Metrodome 's outfield upper deck , resembling baseball cards , showed the retired numbers : Killebrew ( 3 ) , Rod Carew ( 29 ) , Tony Oliva ( 6 ) , Kent <unk> ( 14 ) and Kirby Puckett ( 34 ) . In 1999 , he was ranked 69th on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was nominated as a finalist for Major League Baseball 's All @-@ Century Team . When the Twins moved into Target Field in 2010 , Gate 3 on the southeast ( centerfield ) side of the stadium was named in his honor . There are also corresponding gates for the team 's other retired numbers . Killebrew Canyon at Heavenly Mountain Resort is also named after the baseball star , who skied the outer limits of the resort after his retirement from baseball . 
 Despite rumors that Killebrew was the player depicted in the Major League Baseball logo , according to the creator , Jerry Dior , it was not patterned after Killebrew or any other specific player . Killebrew is the model for the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association , an organization which Killebrew helped found in 1982 . 
 Killebrew was known as an all @-@ around gentleman during his playing career . Reggie Jackson once said , " If Harmon Killebrew isn 't the league 's best player , I 've never seen one . He 's one of the greatest of all time . " He was even noted as being kind to the umpires : 
 The Killer was one of the most feared sluggers in baseball history , but he was also one of the nicest people ever to play the game . He was one of the few players who would go out of his way to compliment umpires on a good job , even if their calls went against him . I 'd call a tough strike on him and he would turn around and say approvingly , " Good call . " And he was the same way in the field . And he never did this to get help on close plays , as some players do . The man hit 573 major league home runs and no umpire ever swung a bat for him . 
 Killebrew was known for his quick hands and exceptional upper @-@ body strength , demonstrated by several " tape measure " home runs that he hit in the prime of his career . Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite , coming off Billy Hoeft at Griffith Stadium . He said of it , " Frank House was the catcher . When I came to the plate , he said , ' Kid , we 're going to throw you a fastball . ' I didn 't know whether to believe him or not . I hit it out . It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit . As I crossed the plate , House said , ' That 's the last time I ever tell you what pitch is coming ' . " 
 On August 3 , 1962 , he was the first batter ever to hit a baseball over the left field roof at Tiger Stadium , a seldom @-@ reached target as contrasted with the old ballpark 's smaller right field area . Only three others accomplished this feat during the next 37 seasons before the stadium was closed . On May 24 , 1964 , Harmon hit the longest measured homer at Baltimore Memorial Stadium , 471 feet ( 144 m ) to deep left center . The ball landed in the far reaches of the bleachers . The only player to hit one completely out of the Orioles ' stadium was Frank Robinson in 1966 ; his blast was reported as about 451 feet ( 137 m ) , or about 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) less than Killebrew 's hit . On June 3 , 1967 , Killebrew hit a 520 @-@ foot ( 160 m ) home run , the longest measured home run ever hit at Metropolitan Stadium and , as of 2011 , the longest in Twins history . That event is commemorated at the Mall of America in Bloomington , which includes a plaque marking home plate , and one red @-@ painted seat from the Met which was placed at the location and elevation of the landing spot of the home run . The new Target Field has a statue of a Gold Glove outside Gate 34 and it is exactly 520 feet ( 160 m ) from Target Field 's home plate . 
 = Lunar Jetman = 
 Lunar Jetman is a shooter video game developed and published by Ultimate Play The Game . It was released for the ZX Spectrum in 1983 and the BBC Micro in 1984 . The game is the second instalment of the Jetman series and one of the few games released to support the Currah <unk> peripheral . In the game , Jetman has to destroy alien bases whilst simultaneously defending himself , along with Earth , from a hostile alien race . 
 Lunar Jetman was Ultimate Play The Game 's first game to require 48K of RAM - all previous games had run on unexpanded 16K models . The game was written by Chris Stamper with graphics designed by Tim Stamper . The game was followed by a third instalment , Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship , released for the NES in 1990 . The game was met with critical acclaim upon release , with praise mostly directed at its addictive gameplay and wide range of colours . It was later included in Rare 's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation , Rare Replay . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Once again taking on the role of Jetman , players find themselves on the surface of a small purple moon . Similarly to its predecessor , the player can move around slowly on foot , or use a jetpack to leave the ground and navigate the moon faster . However , unlike Jetpac , Jetman 's jetpack has limited fuel and must be topped up regularly . In addition to the jetpack , the player has a moon rover for ground travel , inside of which they are invulnerable to damage . However , the moon rover can only negotiate smooth terrain , and Jetman may need to use bridging kits obtained from the rover to fill in craters on the moon 's surface . The moon rover doubles as a refuelling point for Jetman 's jetpack . 
 Aside from the rover and its bridging kits , Jetman has access to three other pieces of equipment , all of which can be carried on the bonnet of the rover , albeit one at a time . Bombs must be used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered , which can only be accomplished when Jetman is flying above them . Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear side of the moon rover . The final piece of equipment is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter 's twin , thus allowing rapid transport around the moon . 
 Gameplay itself requires Jetman to locate and destroy a series of alien bases on the surface of the moon . Each new base appears with the destruction of the previous one . To accomplish this task , Jetman must take the bomb to the alien base — either in his space suit or using the rover — and then fly over the base and drop the bomb . After several bases have been destroyed in succession , new and increasingly hazardous varieties of flying aliens assault the player . Each base must be destroyed within a strict time limit . If this limit expires before the base is destroyed , two missiles are launched from the base — one for Earth , the other for Jetman 's rover . The player will be given a limited time to intercept and destroy the missiles whilst still in flight , thus preventing a game over .

 Similar to its predecessor , the game was critically acclaimed upon release . Crash praised the graphics and wide spectrum of colours , noting that whilst the presentation did not differ much from its predecessor , the graphics were " every bit as good " as superior arcade machines . Home Computing Weekly also praised the presentation , stating that the colour and animation were " superb " , whilst expressing the gameplay as " disgustingly addictive " . 
 When Crash revisited the game in their " <unk> " section of a 1984 issue , the game was still praised , with one reviewer stating that he would not change any of the original scores . Brian Buckley of ZX Computing praised the game 's advanced graphics and effects , stating that extraordinary attention had been paid to detail and that every usage of sound and colour was " excellent " . Buckley also asserted that Lunar Jetman was " the best computer game of all time " . 
 The game replaced its predecessor at the top of the UK ZX Spectrum sales chart . The game was also voted number 31 in the Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time . Home Computing Weekly placed Lunar Jetman third in their " Top 10 programs for the ZX Spectrum " in a later 1983 issue . 
 Lunar Jetman was re @-@ released in August 2015 as part of the Xbox One compilation of 30 Rare titles , Rare Replay . ( Ultimate acquired the trading name Rare in 1988 . ) 
 = General relativity = 
 General relativity ( GR , also known as the general theory of relativity or GTR ) is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics . General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton 's law of universal gravitation , providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time , or spacetime . In particular , the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present . The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations , a system of partial differential equations . 
 Some predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of classical physics , especially concerning the passage of time , the geometry of space , the motion of bodies in free fall , and the propagation of light . Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation , gravitational lensing , the gravitational redshift of light , and the gravitational time delay . The predictions of general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date . Although general relativity is not the only relativistic theory of gravity , it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data . However , unanswered questions remain , the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self @-@ consistent theory of quantum gravity . 
 Einstein 's theory has important astrophysical implications . For example , it implies the existence of black holes — regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing , not even light , can escape — as an end @-@ state for massive stars . There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes ; for example , microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and black holes of a much more massive type , respectively . The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing , in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky . General relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves , which have since been observed directly by physics collaboration LIGO . In addition , general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe . 
 = = History = = 
 Soon after publishing the special theory of relativity in 1905 , Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework . In 1907 , beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall , he embarked on what would be an eight @-@ year search for a relativistic theory of gravity . After numerous detours and false starts , his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations . These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present , and form the core of Einstein 's general theory of relativity . 
 The Einstein field equations are nonlinear and very difficult to solve . Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory . But as early as 1916 , the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non @-@ trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations , the Schwarzschild metric . This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse , and the objects known today as black holes . In the same year , the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild 's solution to electrically charged objects were taken , which eventually resulted in the Reissner – Nordström solution , now associated with electrically charged black holes . In 1917 , Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole , initiating the field of relativistic cosmology . In line with contemporary thinking , he assumed a static universe , adding a new parameter to his original field equations — the cosmological constant — to match that observational presumption . By 1929 , however , the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding . This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922 , which do not require a cosmological constant . Lemaître used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models , in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state . Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life . 
 During that period , general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories . It was clearly superior to Newtonian gravity , being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory . Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters ( " fudge factors " ) . Similarly , a 1919 expedition led by Eddington confirmed general relativity 's prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of May 29 , 1919 , making Einstein instantly famous . Yet the theory entered the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975 , now known as the golden age of general relativity . Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole , and to identify quasars as one of these objects ' astrophysical manifestations . Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory 's predictive power , and relativistic cosmology , too , became amenable to direct observational tests . 
 = = From classical mechanics to general relativity = = 
 General relativity can be understood by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics . The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton 's law of gravity admit a geometric description . The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity . 
 = = = Geometry of Newtonian gravity = = = 
 At the base of classical mechanics is the notion that a body 's motion can be described as a combination of free ( or inertial ) motion , and deviations from this free motion . Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton 's second law of motion , which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body 's ( inertial ) mass multiplied by its acceleration . The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time : in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics , objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed . In modern parlance , their paths are geodesics , straight world lines in curved spacetime . 
 Conversely , one might expect that inertial motions , once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces ( such as electromagnetism or friction ) , can be used to define the geometry of space , as well as a time coordinate . However , there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play . According to Newton 's law of gravity , and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors ( see Eötvös experiment ) , there is a universality of free fall ( also known as the weak equivalence principle , or the universal equality of inertial and passive @-@ gravitational mass ) : the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed , but not on any of its material properties . A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein 's elevator experiment , illustrated in the figure on the right : for an observer in a small enclosed room , it is impossible to decide , by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball , whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field , or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field . 
 Given the universality of free fall , there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force . This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion , namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity . This new class of preferred motions , too , defines a geometry of space and time — in mathematical terms , it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific connection which depends on the gradient of the gravitational potential . Space , in this construction , still has the ordinary Euclidean geometry . However , spacetime as a whole is more complicated . As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free @-@ fall trajectories of different test particles , the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle 's velocity ( time @-@ like vectors ) will vary with the particle 's trajectory ; mathematically speaking , the Newtonian connection is not integrable . From this , one can deduce that spacetime is curved . The resulting Newton – Cartan theory is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts , i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system . In this geometric description , tidal effects — the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall — are related to the derivative of the connection , showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass . 
 = = = Relativistic generalization = = = 
 As intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be , its basis , classical mechanics , is merely a limiting case of ( special ) relativistic mechanics . In the language of symmetry : where gravity can be neglected , physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics . ( The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group , which includes translations and rotations . ) The differences between the two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light , and with high @-@ energy phenomena . 
 With Lorentz symmetry , additional structures come into play . They are defined by the set of light cones ( see image ) . The light @-@ cones define a causal structure : for each event A , there is a set of events that can , in principle , either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light ( such as event B in the image ) , and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible ( such as event C in the image ) . These sets are observer @-@ independent . In conjunction with the world @-@ lines of freely falling particles , the light @-@ cones can be used to reconstruct the space – time 's semi @-@ Riemannian metric , at least up to a positive scalar factor . In mathematical terms , this defines a <unk> structure or conformal geometry . 
 Special relativity is defined in the absence of gravity , so for practical applications , it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected . Bringing gravity into play , and assuming the universality of free fall , an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies : there are no global inertial frames . Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles . Translated into the language of spacetime : the straight time @-@ like lines that define a gravity @-@ free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other , suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry . 
 A priori , it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold — that theory is based on the propagation of light , and thus on electromagnetism , which could have a different set of preferred frames . But using different assumptions about the special @-@ relativistic frames ( such as their being earth @-@ fixed , or in free fall ) , one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift , that is , the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field ( cf. below ) . The actual measurements show that free @-@ falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity . The generalization of this statement , namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling ( and non @-@ rotating ) reference frames , is known as the Einstein equivalence principle , a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special @-@ relativistic physics to include gravity . 
 The same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field — proper time , to give the technical term — does not follow the rules of special relativity . In the language of spacetime geometry , it is not measured by the Minkowski metric . As in the Newtonian case , this is suggestive of a more general geometry . At small scales , all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent , and approximately Minkowskian . Consequently , we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space . The metric tensor that defines the geometry — in particular , how lengths and angles are measured — is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity , it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo @-@ Riemannian metric . Furthermore , each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection , the Levi @-@ Civita connection , and this is , in fact , the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian ( that is , in suitable locally inertial coordinates , the metric is Minkowskian , and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish ) . 
 = = = Einstein 's equations = = = 
 Having formulated the relativistic , geometric version of the effects of gravity , the question of gravity 's source remains . In Newtonian gravity , the source is mass . In special relativity , mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the energy – momentum tensor , which includes both energy and momentum densities as well as stress ( that is , pressure and shear ) . Using the equivalence principle , this tensor is readily generalized to curved space @-@ time . Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity , it is natural to assume that the field equation for gravity relates this tensor and the Ricci tensor , which describes a particular class of tidal effects : the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest , and then fall freely . In special relativity , conservation of energy – momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy – momentum tensor is divergence @-@ free . This formula , too , is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved @-@ manifold counterparts , covariant derivatives studied in differential geometry . With this additional condition — the covariant divergence of the energy – momentum tensor , and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation , is zero — the simplest set of equations are what are called Einstein 's ( field ) equations : 
 On the left @-@ hand side is the Einstein tensor , a specific divergence @-@ free combination of the Ricci tensor <formula> and the metric . Where <formula> is symmetric . In particular , 
 <formula> 
 is the curvature scalar . The Ricci tensor itself is related to the more general Riemann curvature tensor as 
 <formula> 
 On the right @-@ hand side , <formula> is the energy – momentum tensor . All tensors are written in abstract index notation . Matching the theory 's prediction to observational results for planetary orbits ( or , equivalently , assuring that the weak @-@ gravity , low @-@ speed limit is Newtonian mechanics ) , the proportionality constant can be fixed as κ = <unk> / c4 , with G the gravitational constant and c the speed of light . When there is no matter present , so that the energy – momentum tensor vanishes , the results are the vacuum Einstein equations , 
 <formula> 
 = = = Alternatives to general relativity = = = 
 There are alternatives to general relativity built upon the same premises , which include additional rules and / or constraints , leading to different field equations . Examples are <unk> – Dicke theory , <unk> , f ( R ) gravity and Einstein – Cartan theory . 
 = = Definition and basic applications = = 
 The derivation outlined in the previous section contains all the information needed to define general relativity , describe its key properties , and address a question of crucial importance in physics , namely how the theory can be used for model @-@ building . 
 = = = Definition and basic properties = = = 
 General relativity is a metric theory of gravitation . At its core are Einstein 's equations , which describe the relation between the geometry of a four @-@ dimensional , pseudo @-@ Riemannian manifold representing spacetime , and the energy – momentum contained in that spacetime . Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity ( such as free @-@ fall , orbital motion , and spacecraft trajectories ) , correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity ; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural , straight paths . Instead , gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time , which in turn changes the straightest @-@ possible paths that objects will naturally follow . The curvature is , in turn , caused by the energy – momentum of matter . Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler , spacetime tells matter how to move ; matter tells spacetime how to curve . 
 While general relativity replaces the scalar gravitational potential of classical physics by a symmetric rank @-@ two tensor , the latter reduces to the former in certain limiting cases . For weak gravitational fields and slow speed relative to the speed of light , the theory 's predictions converge on those of Newton 's law of universal gravitation . 
 As it is constructed using tensors , general relativity exhibits general covariance : its laws — and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework — take on the same form in all coordinate systems . Furthermore , the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures , i.e. it is background independent . It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity , namely that the laws of physics are the same for all observers . Locally , as expressed in the equivalence principle , spacetime is Minkowskian , and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance . 
 = = = Model @-@ building = = = 
 The core concept of general @-@ relativistic model @-@ building is that of a solution of Einstein 's equations . Given both Einstein 's equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter , such a solution consists of a specific semi @-@ Riemannian manifold ( usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates ) , and specific matter fields defined on that manifold . Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein 's equations , so in particular , the matter 's energy – momentum tensor must be divergence @-@ free . The matter must , of course , also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties . In short , such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity , and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present . 
 Einstein 's equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and , as such , difficult to solve exactly . Nevertheless , a number of exact solutions are known , although only a few have direct physical applications . The best @-@ known exact solutions , and also those most interesting from a physics point of view , are the Schwarzschild solution , the Reissner – Nordström solution and the Kerr metric , each corresponding to a certain type of black hole in an otherwise empty universe , and the Friedmann – Lemaître – Robertson – Walker and de Sitter universes , each describing an expanding cosmos . Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe ( which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes ) , the Taub @-@ <unk> solution ( a model universe that is homogeneous , but anisotropic ) , and anti @-@ de Sitter space ( which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the Maldacena conjecture ) . 
 Given the difficulty of finding exact solutions , Einstein 's field equations are also solved frequently by numerical integration on a computer , or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions . In the field of numerical relativity , powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein 's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes . In principle , such methods may be applied to any system , given sufficient computer resources , and may address fundamental questions such as naked singularities . Approximate solutions may also be found by perturbation theories such as linearized gravity and its generalization , the post @-@ Newtonian expansion , both of which were developed by Einstein . The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light . The expansion involves a series of terms ; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity , whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton 's theory due to general relativity . An extension of this expansion is the parametrized post @-@ Newtonian ( <unk> ) formalism , which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions of general relativity and alternative theories .

Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted , whereas light sent in the opposite direction ( i.e. , climbing out of the gravity well ) is redshifted ; collectively , these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift . More generally , processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away ; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation . 
 Gravitational redshift has been measured in the laboratory and using astronomical observations . Gravitational time dilation in the Earth 's gravitational field has been measured numerous times using atomic clocks , while ongoing validation is provided as a side effect of the operation of the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) . Tests in stronger gravitational fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars . All results are in agreement with general relativity . However , at the current level of accuracy , these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid . 
 = = = Light deflection and gravitational time delay = = = 
 General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field ; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body . This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun . 
 This and related predictions follow from the fact that light follows what is called a light @-@ like or null geodesic — a generalization of the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics . Such geodesics are the generalization of the invariance of <unk> in special relativity . As one examines suitable model spacetimes ( either the exterior Schwarzschild solution or , for more than a single mass , the post @-@ Newtonian expansion ) , several effects of gravity on light propagation emerge . Although the bending of light can also be derived by extending the universality of free fall to light , the angle of deflection resulting from such calculations is only half the value given by general relativity . 
 Closely related to light deflection is the gravitational time delay ( or Shapiro delay ) , the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field . There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction . In the parameterized post @-@ Newtonian formalism ( <unk> ) , measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ , which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space . 
 = = = Gravitational waves = = = 
 Predicted in 1916 by Albert Einstein , there are gravitational waves : ripples in the metric of spacetime that propagate at the speed of light . These are one of several analogies between weak @-@ field gravity and electromagnetism in that , they are analogous to electromagnetic waves . On February 11 , 2016 , the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging . 
 The simplest type of such a wave can be visualized by its action on a ring of freely floating particles . A sine wave propagating through such a ring towards the reader distorts the ring in a characteristic , rhythmic fashion ( animated image to the right ) . Since Einstein 's equations are non @-@ linear , arbitrarily strong gravitational waves do not obey linear superposition , making their description difficult . However , for weak fields , a linear approximation can be made . Such linearized gravitational waves are sufficiently accurate to describe the exceedingly weak waves that are expected to arrive here on Earth from far @-@ off cosmic events , which typically result in relative distances increasing and decreasing by <formula> or less . Data analysis methods routinely make use of the fact that these linearized waves can be Fourier decomposed . 
 Some exact solutions describe gravitational waves without any approximation , e.g. , a wave train traveling through empty space or Gowdy universes , varieties of an expanding cosmos filled with gravitational waves . But for gravitational waves produced in <unk> relevant situations , such as the merger of two black holes , numerical methods are presently the only way to construct appropriate models . 
 = = = Orbital effects and the relativity of direction = = = 
 General relativity differs from classical mechanics in a number of predictions concerning orbiting bodies . It predicts an overall rotation ( precession ) of planetary orbits , as well as orbital decay caused by the emission of gravitational waves and effects related to the relativity of direction . 
 = = = = Precession of apsides = = = = 
 In general relativity , the apsides of any orbit ( the point of the orbiting body 's closest approach to the system 's center of mass ) will precess — the orbit is not an ellipse , but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus , resulting in a rose curve @-@ like shape ( see image ) . Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a test particle . For him , the fact that his theory gave a straightforward explanation of the anomalous perihelion shift of the planet Mercury , discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859 , was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations . 
 The effect can also be derived by using either the exact Schwarzschild metric ( describing spacetime around a spherical mass ) or the much more general post @-@ Newtonian formalism . It is due to the influence of gravity on the geometry of space and to the contribution of self @-@ energy to a body 's gravity ( encoded in the nonlinearity of Einstein 's equations ) . Relativistic precession has been observed for all planets that allow for accurate precession measurements ( Mercury , Venus , and Earth ) , as well as in binary pulsar systems , where it is larger by five orders of magnitude . 
 In general relativity the perihelion shift σ , expressed in radians per revolution , is approximately given by : 
 <formula> 
 where L is the semi @-@ major axis , T is the orbital period , c is the speed of light , and e is the orbital eccentricity . 
 = = = = Orbital decay = = = = 
 According to general relativity , a binary system will emit gravitational waves , thereby losing energy . Due to this loss , the distance between the two orbiting bodies decreases , and so does their orbital period . Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars , the effect is too small to be observable . This is not the case for a close binary pulsar , a system of two orbiting neutron stars , one of which is a pulsar : from the pulsar , observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock , which allows precise measurements of the orbital period . Because neutron stars are immensely compact , significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation . 
 The first observation of a decrease in orbital period due to the emission of gravitational waves was made by Hulse and Taylor , using the binary pulsar PSR1913 + 16 they had discovered in 1974 . This was the first detection of gravitational waves , albeit indirect , for which they were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics . Since then , several other binary pulsars have been found , in particular the double pulsar PSR <unk> @-@ 3039 , in which both stars are pulsars . 
 = = = = Geodetic precession and frame @-@ dragging = = = = 
 Several relativistic effects are directly related to the relativity of direction . One is geodetic precession : the axis direction of a gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared , for instance , with the direction of light received from distant stars — even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible ( " parallel transport " ) . For the Moon – Earth system , this effect has been measured with the help of lunar laser ranging . More recently , it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0 @.@ 3 % . 
 Near a rotating mass , there are gravitomagnetic or frame @-@ dragging effects . A distant observer will determine that objects close to the mass get " dragged around " . This is most extreme for rotating black holes where , for any object entering a zone known as the ergosphere , rotation is inevitable . Such effects can again be tested through their influence on the orientation of gyroscopes in free fall . Somewhat controversial tests have been performed using the <unk> satellites , confirming the relativistic prediction . Also the Mars Global Surveyor probe around Mars has been used . 
 = = Astrophysical applications = = 
 = = = Gravitational lensing = = = 
 The deflection of light by gravity is responsible for a new class of astronomical phenomena . If a massive object is situated between the astronomer and a distant target object with appropriate mass and relative distances , the astronomer will see multiple distorted images of the target . Such effects are known as gravitational lensing . Depending on the configuration , scale , and mass distribution , there can be two or more images , a bright ring known as an Einstein ring , or partial rings called arcs . The earliest example was discovered in 1979 ; since then , more than a hundred gravitational lenses have been observed . Even if the multiple images are too close to each other to be resolved , the effect can still be measured , e.g. , as an overall brightening of the target object ; a number of such " microlensing events " have been observed . 
 Gravitational lensing has developed into a tool of observational astronomy . It is used to detect the presence and distribution of dark matter , provide a " natural telescope " for observing distant galaxies , and to obtain an independent estimate of the Hubble constant . Statistical evaluations of lensing data provide valuable insight into the structural evolution of galaxies . 
 = = = Gravitational wave astronomy = = = 
 Observations of binary pulsars provide strong indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational waves ( see Orbital decay , above ) . Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity @-@ related research . Several land @-@ based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation , most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600 , LIGO ( two detectors ) , <unk> 300 and <unk> . Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10 − 9 to 10 − 6 Hertz frequency range , which originate from binary supermassive <unk> . A European space @-@ based detector , <unk> / NGO , is currently under development , with a precursor mission ( LISA Pathfinder ) having launched in December 2015 . 
 Observations of gravitational waves promise to complement observations in the electromagnetic spectrum . They are expected to yield information about black holes and other dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs , about certain kinds of supernova implosions , and about processes in the very early universe , including the signature of certain types of hypothetical cosmic string . In February 2016 , the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole merger . 
 = = = Black holes and other compact objects = = = 
 Whenever the ratio of an object 's mass to its radius becomes sufficiently large , general relativity predicts the formation of a black hole , a region of space from which nothing , not even light , can escape . In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution , neutron stars of around 1 @.@ 4 solar masses , and stellar black holes with a few to a few dozen solar masses , are thought to be the final state for the evolution of massive stars . Usually a galaxy has one supermassive black hole with a few million to a few billion solar masses in its center , and its presence is thought to have played an important role in the formation of the galaxy and larger cosmic structures . 
 <unk> , the most important property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation . Accretion , the falling of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes , is thought to be responsible for some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects , notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar @-@ size objects such as microquasars . In particular , accretion can lead to relativistic jets , focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed . General relativity plays a central role in modelling all these phenomena , and observations provide strong evidence for the existence of black holes with the properties predicted by the theory . 
 Black holes are also sought @-@ after targets in the search for gravitational waves ( cf . Gravitational waves , above ) . Merging black hole binaries should lead to some of the strongest gravitational wave signals reaching detectors here on Earth , and the phase directly before the merger ( " chirp " ) could be used as a " standard candle " to deduce the distance to the merger events – and hence serve as a probe of cosmic expansion at large distances . The gravitational waves produced as a stellar black hole plunges into a supermassive one should provide direct information about the supermassive black hole 's geometry . 
 = = = Cosmology = = = 
 The current models of cosmology are based on Einstein 's field equations , which include the cosmological constant Λ since it has important influence on the large @-@ scale dynamics of the cosmos , 
 <formula> 
 where <formula> is the spacetime metric . <unk> and homogeneous solutions of these enhanced equations , the Friedmann – Lemaître – Robertson – Walker solutions , allow physicists to model a universe that has evolved over the past 14 billion years from a hot , early Big Bang phase . Once a small number of parameters ( for example the universe 's mean matter density ) have been fixed by astronomical observation , further observational data can be used to put the models to the test . Predictions , all successful , include the initial abundance of chemical elements formed in a period of primordial nucleosynthesis , the large @-@ scale structure of the universe , and the existence and properties of a " thermal echo " from the early cosmos , the cosmic background radiation . 
 Astronomical observations of the cosmological expansion rate allow the total amount of matter in the universe to be estimated , although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part . About 90 % of all matter appears to be dark matter , which has mass ( or , equivalently , gravitational influence ) , but does not interact electromagnetically and , hence , cannot be observed directly . There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter , within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise . Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or , equivalently , by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state , known as dark energy , the nature of which remains unclear . 
 An inflationary phase , an additional phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10 − 33 seconds , was hypothesized in 1980 to account for several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models , such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation . Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation have resulted in the first evidence for this scenario . However , there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios , which cannot be restricted by current observations . An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe , prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity . An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity , which has not yet been developed ( cf. the section on quantum gravity , below ) . 
 = = = Time travel = = = 
 Kurt Gödel showed that solutions to Einstein 's equations exist that contain closed timelike curves ( CTCs ) , which allow for loops in time . The solutions require extreme physical conditions unlikely ever to occur in practice , and it remains an open question whether further laws of physics will eliminate them completely . Since then other — similarly impractical — GR solutions containing CTCs have been found , such as the <unk> cylinder and traversable wormholes . 
 = = Advanced concepts = = 
 = = = Causal structure and global geometry = = = 
 In general relativity , no material body can catch up with or overtake a light pulse . No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence , an exploration of all light worldlines ( null geodesics ) yields key information about the spacetime 's causal structure . This structure can be displayed using Penrose – Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ( " <unk> " ) so as to fit onto a finite map , while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams . 
 Aware of the importance of causal structure , Roger Penrose and others developed what is known as global geometry . In global geometry , the object of study is not one particular solution ( or family of solutions ) to Einstein 's equations . Rather , relations that hold true for all geodesics , such as the <unk> equation , and additional non @-@ specific assumptions about the nature of matter ( usually in the form of energy conditions ) are used to derive general results . 
 = = = Horizons = = = 
 Using global geometry , some spacetimes can be shown to contain boundaries called horizons , which demarcate one region from the rest of spacetime . The best @-@ known examples are black holes : if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space ( as specified in the hoop conjecture , the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius ) , no light from inside can escape to the outside . Since no object can overtake a light pulse , all interior matter is imprisoned as well . Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible , showing that the boundary , the black hole 's horizon , is not a physical barrier . 
 Early studies of black holes relied on explicit solutions of Einstein 's equations , notably the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution ( used to describe a static black hole ) and the axisymmetric Kerr solution ( used to describe a rotating , stationary black hole , and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere ) . Using global geometry , later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes . In the long run , they are rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying energy , linear momentum , angular momentum , location at a specified time and electric charge . This is stated by the black hole uniqueness theorems : " black holes have no hair " , that is , no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans . Irrespective of the complexity of a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole , the object that results ( having emitted gravitational waves ) is very simple . 
 Even more remarkably , there is a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics , which is analogous to the laws of thermodynamics . For instance , by the second law of black hole mechanics , the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time , analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system . This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole ( e.g. by the Penrose process ) . There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are , in fact , a subset of the laws of thermodynamics , and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy . This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics : for instance , as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics , it is possible for black hole area to decrease — as long as other processes ensure that , overall , entropy increases . As thermodynamical objects with non @-@ zero temperature , black holes should emit thermal radiation . Semi @-@ classical calculations indicate that indeed they do , with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck 's law . This radiation is known as Hawking radiation ( cf. the quantum theory section , below ) . 
 There are other types of horizons . In an expanding universe , an observer may find that some regions of the past cannot be observed ( " particle horizon " ) , and some regions of the future cannot be influenced ( event horizon ) . Even in flat Minkowski space , when described by an accelerated observer ( <unk> space ) , there will be horizons associated with a semi @-@ classical radiation known as Unruh radiation . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Another general feature of general relativity is the appearance of spacetime boundaries known as singularities . Spacetime can be explored by following up on timelike and <unk> geodesics — all possible ways that light and particles in free fall can travel . But some solutions of Einstein 's equations have " ragged edges " — regions known as spacetime singularities , where the paths of light and falling particles come to an abrupt end , and geometry becomes ill @-@ defined . In the more interesting cases , these are " curvature singularities " , where geometrical quantities characterizing spacetime curvature , such as the Ricci scalar , take on infinite values . Well @-@ known examples of spacetimes with future singularities — where worldlines end — are the Schwarzschild solution , which describes a singularity inside an eternal static black hole , or the Kerr solution with its ring @-@ shaped singularity inside an eternal rotating black hole . The Friedmann – Lemaître – Robertson – Walker solutions and other spacetimes describing universes have past singularities on which worldlines begin , namely Big Bang singularities , and some have future singularities ( Big Crunch ) as well . 
 Given that these examples are all highly symmetric — and thus simplified — it is tempting to conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization . The famous singularity theorems , proved using the methods of global geometry , say otherwise : singularities are a generic feature of general relativity , and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also at the beginning of a wide class of expanding universes . However , the theorems say little about the properties of singularities , and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities ' generic structure ( hypothesized e.g. by the <unk> conjecture ) . The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities ( no perfect symmetries , matter with realistic properties ) are safely hidden away behind a horizon , and thus invisible to all distant observers . While no formal proof yet exists , numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity . 
 = = = Evolution equations = = = 
 Each solution of Einstein 's equation encompasses the whole history of a universe — it is not just some snapshot of how things are , but a whole , possibly matter @-@ filled , spacetime . It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe . Due to its general covariance , Einstein 's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor . It must be combined with a coordinate condition , which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories . 
 To understand Einstein 's equations as partial differential equations , it is helpful to formulate them in a way that describes the evolution of the universe over time . This is done in " 3 + 1 " formulations , where spacetime is split into three space dimensions and one time dimension . The best @-@ known example is the ADM formalism . These decompositions show that the spacetime evolution equations of general relativity are well @-@ behaved : solutions always exist , and are uniquely defined , once suitable initial conditions have been specified . Such formulations of Einstein 's field equations are the basis of numerical relativity . 
 = = = Global and quasi @-@ local quantities = = = 
 The notion of evolution equations is intimately tied in with another aspect of general relativistic physics . In Einstein 's theory , it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system 's total mass ( or energy ) . The main reason is that the gravitational field — like any physical field — must be ascribed a certain energy , but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy . 
 Nevertheless , there are possibilities to define a system 's total mass , either using a hypothetical " infinitely distant observer " ( ADM mass ) or suitable symmetries ( <unk> mass ) . If one excludes from the system 's total mass the energy being carried away to infinity by gravitational waves , the result is the Bondi mass at null infinity . Just as in classical physics , it can be shown that these masses are positive . Corresponding global definitions exist for momentum and angular momentum . There have also been a number of attempts to define quasi @-@ local quantities , such as the mass of an isolated system formulated using only quantities defined within a finite region of space containing that system . The hope is to obtain a quantity useful for general statements about isolated systems , such as a more precise formulation of the hoop conjecture . 
 = = Relationship with quantum theory = = 
 If general relativity were considered to be one of the two pillars of modern physics , then quantum theory , the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to solid state physics , would be the other . However , how to reconcile quantum theory with general relativity is still an open question . 
 = = = Quantum field theory in curved spacetime = = = 
 Ordinary quantum field theories , which form the basis of modern elementary particle physics , are defined in flat Minkowski space , which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth . In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence ( quantum ) matter , yet not strong enough to require quantization itself , physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime . These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime , and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime . Using this formalism , it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation , leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time . As briefly mentioned above , this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes . 
 = = = Quantum gravity = = = 
 The demand for consistency between a quantum description of matter and a geometric description of spacetime , as well as the appearance of singularities ( where curvature length scales become microscopic ) , indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity : for an adequate description of the interior of black holes , and of the very early universe , a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics . Despite major efforts , no complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity is currently known , even though a number of promising candidates exist . 
 Attempts to generalize ordinary quantum field theories , used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions , so as to include gravity have led to serious problems . Some have argued that at low energies , this approach proves successful , in that it results in an acceptable effective ( quantum ) field theory of gravity . At very high energies , however , the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ( " perturbative non @-@ <unk> " ) . 
 One attempt to overcome these limitations is string theory , a quantum theory not of point particles , but of minute one @-@ dimensional extended objects . The theory promises to be a unified description of all particles and interactions , including gravity ; the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three . In what is called the second superstring revolution , it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven @-@ dimensional model known as M @-@ theory , which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity .
