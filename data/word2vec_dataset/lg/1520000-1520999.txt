 After graduating , Shelley worked in Seremban in Negeri Sembilan , Malaysia , until May 1965 . He then returned to Singapore and began working for a company manufacturing pipes , subsequently starting his own machinery @-@ importing business . He also served on the Public Service Commission ( PSC ) for over three decades , from 1976 to 2007 . The PSC is a body created by the Constitution of Singapore that appoints , promotes , dismisses and exercises disciplinary control over public officers in Singapore . It has additional responsibility for planning and administering scholarships provided by the Government of Singapore . Shelley was involved in interviewing civil servants as well as students seeking scholarships ; he wrote a book entitled How to Interview Well and Get that Job ! ( 2004 ) . For service to the people of Singapore , the Government conferred the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat ( Public Service Star ) on him in 1978 , awarding an additional Bar the following year . 
 Shelley taught himself to speak Japanese , and edited Words mean Business : A Basic Japanese Business Glossary ( 1984 ) , a new version of a book first published the year before . Subsequently , he wrote Japan ( Cultures of the World series , 1990 ) and Culture Shock ! : Japan ( 1993 ) . He was also a self @-@ taught painter and piano accordion player . 
 = = Fiction writing = = 
 Shelley began writing fiction late in life , publishing his first novel The Shrimp People in 1991 at the age of sixty one . The first substantial novel by a Singaporean writer about the Eurasian community in Singapore , it was the best @-@ selling local paperback at the Times bookshop for three consecutive weeks between 22 August and 5 September 1991 , and remained in the top five until 11 December that year . The work won the National Book Development Council of Singapore Award for works in English the following year despite being up against books by established writers such as Gopal <unk> and <unk> Christine Lim . He wrote three more books , People of the Pear Tree ( 1993 ) , Island in the Centre ( 1995 ) and A River of Roses ( 1998 ) , on the same theme within a decade . The first two of these won National Book Development Council Highly Commended Awards in 1994 and 1996 respectively , while the last won the <unk> Singapore Literature Prize ( now known simply as the Singapore Literature Prize ) in 2000 . 
 According to poet Edwin Thumboo , an emeritus professor of the National University of Singapore , Shelley " was a sensitive and acute observer of life . Because he started writing late , the material that generated his fiction was well digested . He brought to bear on it all the insights of an engineer , businessman , administrator , public servant and a person who loved life . His character analysis was therefore penetrating , and his range of characters are fully reflective of the society he wrote about . " Associate Professor Kirpal Singh of the Singapore Management University , himself a writer and literary editor , has commented that although Shelley 's impact on the Singapore literary scene had been " much less than it ought to be " , his body of work was significant for both the Eurasian community and the wider Singapore society : 
 Rex belongs to the small but significant group of writers who have articulated the experiences of the Eurasians . I think , some over @-@ writing notwithstanding , Rex 's contribution is admirable . At its best , Rex 's writing is passionate , humane and highly focused . Though he generally kept a low profile , his literary works will stand the test of time , combining a sharp sense of observed commentary with historical detail . 
 Shelley was the 2007 Singaporean winner of the S.E.A. Write Award . In August 2009 , Marshall Cavendish , a subsidiary of the Times Publishing Group , reissued Shelley 's books The Shrimp People and a non @-@ fiction work first published in 1995 , Sounds and Sins of Singlish . 
 In 2015 , The Shrimp People was selected by The Business Times as one of the Top 10 English Singapore books from 1965 – 2015 , alongside titles by Arthur Yap , Daren Shiau and Amanda Lee Koe .

 = Sunday Morning ( No Doubt song ) = 
 " Sunday Morning " is a song recorded by American rock band No Doubt . It was released as the sixth single from their third studio album Tragic Kingdom ( 1995 ) . The single was made available as a CD single , cassette single , and VHS single on May 27 , 1997 through Interscope . Lyrically , the song is about Gwen Stefani 's relationship with Tony Kanal , and their breakup that followed . The track was written by band members Kanal , Gwen Stefani , and Eric Stefani , while production was handled by Matthew Wilder . 
 The single was well received by many music critics , with one of them calling it a " standout track " . It also performed well commercially , peaking in the top 50 in several countries , including the UK , Canada , and Australia ; the song was certified gold in the latter country for sales of over 35 @,@ 000 copies . Musically , " Sunday Morning " is a ska punk and reggae rock song . A music video for the single was released in 1996 and directed by Sophie Muller ; it features the band members preparing a large feast before getting into a food fight .

 Recording sessions and meetings for No Doubt 's third studio album Tragic Kingdom ( 1995 ) began in 1993 between members Eric Stefani , Gwen Stefani , Tony Kanal , Tom Dumont , Adrian Young , and musician Gary Angle . The material produced with Angle was hugely rejected by Interscope Records ' officials , and had the members work with producer Matthew Wilder instead . Upset with working with someone outside the band , Eric eventually stopped recording with the band , and encouraged the remaining members to write the group 's songs , as he felt threatened when he did so . After Kanal broke off his seven @-@ year relationship with Gwen , both of them wrote several more songs , until there was enough material for an album . The single 's inspiration came when Kanal was having a fight with Stefani , his then @-@ girlfriend , through the bathroom door of his parents ' house in Yorba Linda , California ; Stefani later revamped the lyrics to discuss her breakup with Kanal . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Sunday Morning " was written by Kanal , Gwen Stefani , and Eric Stefani , while production was handled by Matthew Wilder . The song is a ska punk and reggae rock song , with one critic comparing it to Motown music . According to Chris Heath of Rolling Stone , the single " erupts delightfully from its opening harmonies into a thumping combination of Motown and pop cheese , is especially spirited " ; he later compared it to Kim Wilde 's 1981 single " Kids in America " . Kenneth Partridge , writing for Billboard , stated that the song allowed Gwen to go " from victim to victor " , especially in the lyrics " Thank you , now you 're the parasite " ; in Partridge 's The A.V. Club review , he described it as " a straight @-@ up ska track " that " didn 't chart as high , but the damage was done " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 After its release , " Sunday Morning " received general acclaim from music critics . Kenneth Partridge of Billboard appreciated Gwen " constantly gaining and losing the upper hand in her romantic adventures " . Thomas Bleach , writing for his self @-@ titled blog , also enjoyed the track , calling the " infectious chorus , fast pace and cheeky nature of the song appeal [ ing ] " . A critic writing for The Diamondback favored the " defiant " sound of the track , while a reviewer from Punk News titled the song a " gem " , but predicted that " on a weaker album , [ it ] would have made more of a splash . " Mike Boehm of the Los Angeles Times cited the song as an " example of the band 's improved craft " and claimed that it " help [ s ] carry the album 's thematic current " of " enthusiastic music " . Similarly , Nicholas Jones of The Odyssey Online called it a " standout track " , due to it being " lyrically clever " . 
 In a poll held by Rolling Stone , Brittany Spanos asked readers to vote on " The 10 Best Gwen Stefani Songs " ; " Sunday Morning " took fourth place and its consensus stated " Stefani is a powerhouse on the raucous , bitter single . [ ... ] From the moment Adrian Young 's opening drum solo builds up , the song grows more and more massive and searing . "

 " Sunday Morning " was moderately successful , with it charting in several countries . In the United States , the song did not enter the Billboard Hot 100 , but entered the Mainstream Top 40 component chart , where it peaked at number thirty @-@ five . In Australia , the single peaked at position twenty @-@ one , and lasted on the chart for a total of nineteen weeks ; it was later certified gold by the ARIA for sales of over 35 @,@ 000 copies .

 An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Sophie Muller and premiered in 1996 ; Muller was initially asked to produce a video for Tragic Kingdom 's lead single " Just a Girl " , but nothing came of it . " Sunday Morning " marked Muller 's second collaboration with the band , following " Don 't Speak " . In a 2012 interview with OC Weekly , Muller spoke of the result of the single 's music video : 
 " Of all my videos , I suppose ' Sunday Morning ' is the most like them . It 's the most honest – where they are all hang out together , that feels very real to me . They all get on and they 're very good friends and have very different lives . When I met them some of them were still living with their parents ! ( Well , some of them . ) They hang on to each other in the sense of that when they got huge across the world , there was already a sense of family between them . " 
 The video was filmed at Gwen Stefani 's grandparent 's house in Anaheim , California , in a one @-@ day shoot . Band member Dumont stated that the video " was really normal for us before this weird success " , listing their routine of rehearsing in a garage and later having a big dinner and how that was average for them . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The video commences with a scene of the band beginning to perform the song in a house 's detached garage . When the first verse starts , Stefani 's ex @-@ lover ( Terry Hall ) walks by the house before sitting down on a swing . Stefani changes her shoes as the song 's chorus is played ; she walks away from the garage and down a street to a grocery store . At the store , she purchases four cans of tomato sauce , and quickly leaves . Meanwhile , Dumont , Kanal , and Young prepare a large dinner for the band as Stefani reenters the home . Stefani slices tomatoes , Dumont cooks some spaghetti noodles , Kanal cuts up a few onions , and Young sets the table . At the song 's bridge , Stefani accidentally cuts herself with a knife and Kanal drops a pot of pasta sauce ; both of them promptly clean up their messes as dinner is served . Dumont initiates a food fight , and touring members Gabriel McNair and Stephen Bradley join in . The video ends with the ex @-@ lover sitting alone on the swing .

 = California State Route 70 = 
 State Route 70 ( SR 70 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California . Connecting Sacramento with U.S. Route 395 ( US 395 ) near Beckwourth Pass ( lowest in the Sierra Nevada ) via the Feather River Canyon . Through the Feather River Canyon , from SR 149 to US 395 , SR 70 is the Feather River Scenic Byway , a Forest Service Byway that parallels the ex @-@ Western Pacific Railroad 's Feather River Route . 
 The Beckwourth Trail was the earliest predecessor of SR 70 , which was a spur of the California Trail . This was followed by the railroad , mostly built on the route of the trail ; a dirt road was needed for construction that was later converted into part of the present state highway . Construction on the highway began in 1928 , which involved the boring of three tunnels . Previously , the road was signed as U.S. Route 40 Alternate , crossing the Sierra Nevada at a lower elevation than Donner Pass on US 40 , now Interstate 80 ( I @-@ 80 ) . The road was renumbered SR 70 in the 1964 state highway renumbering . Today , portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to a four @-@ lane expressway , and even a freeway in a few locations . 
 = = Route description = = 
 State Route 70 begins at a partial interchange with SR 99 north of Sacramento , close to the Feather River Route rail line that parallels the entire highway , and heads north along a four @-@ lane mix of expressway and freeway . Just north of the Bear River crossing / Yuba County line , in Plumas Lake , SR 70 becomes a freeway for the second time , which continues to just beyond the Yuba River in Marysville . Within that city , SR 70 makes two turns and overlaps SR 20 before heading north on a two @-@ lane road . Another four @-@ lane freeway begins south of SR 162 in Oroville , and ends at SR 149 . SR 149 is a major connection northwest to SR 99 , and became the straight @-@ through movement when the construction to replace the intersection with an interchange was completed in November 2008 . The State Scenic Highway portion of SR 70 begins at SR 149 , which is where SR 70 turns northeast out of the Sacramento Valley and into the mountains . The short SR 191 spurs north to Paradise , while SR 70 crosses the West Branch Feather River on the double @-@ decker West Branch Bridge , with the Feather River Route below . A short four @-@ lane section runs over the bridge towards Jarbo Gap , where the present SR 70 merges with the old road ( Dark Canyon Road ) that was used before the Feather River was dammed to create Lake Oroville in the 1960s . 
 After crossing through Jarbo Gap , SR 70 drops down into the canyon of the North Fork Feather River , which it follows almost to Quincy , usually on the opposite side from the Feather River Route ; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other . The first of these is the <unk> Bridge , an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge ; soon after are the highway 's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon . After a fair distance through the canyon , and that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River , SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton ; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point , where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek . 
 The highway heads southeast , partly along the latter creek , past Keddie to Quincy in the American Valley . It leaves the valley via Greenhorn Creek , passing the Feather River Route 's Williams Loop and then following the small <unk> Creek to Lee Summit , which the rail line passes under in the Spring Garden Tunnel . This brings SR 70 into the valley of the Middle Fork Feather River , which takes it southeast to <unk> , where the State Scenic Highway ends and State Route 89 splits to the south , and then east , through the Plumas National Forest , to Portola and Beckwourth . The large Sierra Valley begins at the latter community , and SR 70 heads almost directly across , passing the north end of SR 49 at Vinton and the south end of SR 284 at <unk> before crossing Beckwourth Pass , which the railroad takes the <unk> Tunnel under , and descending slightly to end at U.S. 395 at Hallelujah Junction . 
 The portion of SR 70 west of State Route 89 near <unk> is also eligible for the State Scenic Highway System , but has not been designated as such by Caltrans . The entire route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System , though it is mostly two lanes .

 James Beckwourth opened the Beckwourth Trail over Beckwourth Pass in 1851 , crossing the Sierra Nevada at a lower elevation than the existing Donner Pass route of the California Trail . This split from the Truckee Route of the California Trail near Reno and roughly followed the present SR 70 to Quincy , but , rather than passing through the Feather River Canyon , it followed Oroville @-@ Quincy Highway along ridges to Bidwell 's Bar . A company was incorporated on July 23 , 1855 to build the Quincy and Spanish Ranch Wagon Road , which bypassed the older trail from Quincy west to Spanish Ranch and began collecting tolls in November . The Pioneer Wagon Road , another toll road , was built in 1856 and 1857 , continuing the improvements southwest to Buckeye ( just before the Butte County line ) . An 1866 law authorized Plumas County to improve the portion from Quincy east to Beckwourth . The county also improved the road east from Beckwourth over the pass as part of the Red Clover Wagon Road , which began at Genesee and was completed in the 1870s . 
 The Western Pacific Railroad completed its main line into California in 1909 . This followed the old Beckwourth Trail east of Quincy , but to the west it reached Oroville and Marysville via the Feather River Canyon . While building the railroad , the Utah Construction Company had created a dirt road through the canyon to assist with construction ; citizens created the Plumas County Road Association in 1911 to push for improvements to this roadway and creation of a year @-@ round route between Oroville and Quincy ( the existing route over the ridges was closed for at least four months each winter ) . The first state highway bond issue , passed by the state 's voters in 1910 , included a Route 30 connecting Oroville with Quincy . Plumas County surveyor Arthur W. Keddie surveyed the Feather River Canyon route for the California Highway Commission in 1913 , but the state announced in 1916 that the existing ridge route would be improved . After much debate , the state legislative road committee included the statement that this route would follow the Feather River in the 1919 amendment authorizing a third bond issue ; instead of keeping it as Route 30 , the Highway Commission changed the designation to an extension of the short Richvale @-@ Oroville ( now SR 162 ) Route 21 , which was also part of the first bond issue . 
 = = = Modern route = = = 
 Construction began on July 1 , 1928 , with convict labor for the easier portions and contractors for the remainder , as well as bridges and tunnels , but was slowed by the Great Depression . On the most difficult portion , between Cresta and Rock Creek , three tunnels had to be built at Arch Rock , Grizzly Dome , and Elephant Butte ; at the former two , surveyors had to hang out on rope over steep granite slopes , and rockslides repeatedly caused delays . The commission dedicated the road at a ceremony at Grizzly Dome , halfway between the ends , on August 14 , 1937 . Construction had cost $ 8 @.@ 15 million for 78 miles ( 126 km ) of new road . The remainder of the old trail from Quincy to the junction with Route 29 ( now U.S. 395 ) east of Beckwourth Pass was added to the state highway system in 1931 as an extension of Route 21 , and was paved by 1936 . A new Route 87 was created in 1933 , stretching from Woodland via Marysville and Oroville to Route 3 ( State Route 99 ) southeast of Chico , including the present SR 70 between Marysville and Oroville . Route 87 from Woodland to Oroville and Route 21 from Oroville to east of Beckwourth Pass became a new State Route 24 in 1934 ; State Route 24 was extended southwest from Woodland to Oakland by the end of 1937 . 
 In 1954 , the original part of State Route 24 was replaced by U.S. Route 40 Alternate , which continued south on U.S. 99W from Woodland to Davis and southeast on U.S. 395 to Reno , Nevada to join U.S. 40 at both ends . A direct route from Marysville south to Sacramento was added to the state highway system in 1949 as Route 232 , and later became part of a rerouted State Route 24 . The U.S. 40 Alternate designation was short @-@ lived , and was mostly replaced by State Route 70 in the 1964 renumbering . Southwest of Marysville , former U.S. 40 Alternate instead became State Route 113 , and SR 70 ran south along former State Route 24 ( Route 232 ) to a point north of Sacramento , where the new State Route 99 came in from the northwest and continued south . Despite SR 70 always ending at State Route 99 , it was once signed along State Route 99 ( El Centro Road , Garden Highway , and the <unk> Street Bridge ) to Sacramento . 
 When it was originally built , the Feather River Highway northeast from Oroville followed the present Oroville Dam Boulevard ( County Route B2 ) to the present location of the Oroville Dam , and then ran north and northeast alongside the North Fork Feather River along a route now covered by Lake Oroville . It left to the north on Dark Canyon Road , meeting the present alignment at Jarbo Gap . Since the old road would be flooded , a $ 14 @.@ 8 million new alignment , much of it four lanes , was built around the west side ; the Western Pacific Railroad was also relocated to a nearby alignment . The double @-@ decker West Branch Bridge over the West Branch Feather River northwest of the dam , carrying the highway above the rail line , was dedicated on August 15 , 1962 . Three portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to freeways : north of SR 99 to Berry and Kempton Roads in the early 2010s ; south from Marysville to the State Route 65 split in the mid @-@ 1950s , extended farther south in the late 1960s and late 2000s ; and around downtown Oroville , built in the early 1960s . In 2004 , SR 70 was upgraded to a four @-@ lane expressway between Feather River Boulevard north of the Bear River and the Yuba / Sutter county line to the freeway portion south of McGowan Parkway . A freeway interchange was constructed in 2008 at Plumas Lake Boulevard for access to the Plumas Lake development previously served at an uncontrolled intersection with Plumas <unk> Road . The removal of this intersection effectively upgraded the expressway portion to freeway south to the Feather River Boulevard intersection . In the early 2010s , the last two @-@ lane segment of SR 70 south of Marysville was expanded to a four @-@ lane expressway , with a freeway section bypassing the small town of East Nicolaus to the west . In 2015 , the interchange with Feather River Boulevard in Plumas Lake was opened to traffic , eliminating the last signalized intersection between Sacramento ( with SR 99 ) and Marysville .

When Buhari declared him a wanted man , Adewole went into exile . He worked at the Cancer Campaign Research Institute in London , where he authored four papers . He later returned to Nigeria and was elected deputy Secretary @-@ general of the Nigerian Medical Association in 1988 . In 1990 he was elected Secretary @-@ general of the Nigerian Medical Association . He held the position for two years , and in 1993 , he was elected chairman of the Oyo State chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association . In March 1992 he was elected assistant secretary @-@ general of the Confederation of African Medical Associations and Societies , and after his tenure ended in August 1997 he was elected secretary of the African regional task force on the control of gynaecological cancers .

 In addition to his outstanding contributions to medicine and academics , he is also a pundit . In his welcome address at a public lecture organised by the Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa held at the International Conference Centre , International Institute of Tropical Agriculture , Ibadan , he lamented the decline of Africa 's contribution to global scientific output . He advocated for the commensurate expansion in doctoral training to meet the human resources needs of the new institutions as well as the existing ones . 
 In 2014 , during the Ebola virus outbreak in Nigeria , he led a panel of experts to brainstorm on the latest scientific information on the nature of the virus , its signs , symptoms , and prevention . At a meeting held at the University of Ibadan to mobilise against the virus , he said " Nigeria is still safe , though we suffered a biological attack when Mr. Patrick Sawyer came into Nigeria from Liberia " . He called on security agencies to investigate the bank accounts of Patrick Sawyer , who imported the virus into the country , to discover if he was paid to terrorise the country with the virus . 
 While receiving an award of excellence for outstanding contributions to obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Sunderland 2015 convocation ceremonies , he said 
 any war against terror must be fought through collective efforts to nip it in the bud . An African proverb says ' Until you unmask it , a masquerade remains a terror ' . A war against terror – of any kind – is best achieved through collective efforts . Our modest contributions from our corner of the globe have helped in restoring hope to millions of people without hope . It has become a lamp among the armament that unmasked the monster HIV , and we shall continue to beam the light of research on all threats to human existence . 
 As part of efforts to end insurgency in Nigeria , the Ambassador of France to Nigeria Jacques Champagne de <unk> visited Adewole in his office at the University of Ibadan . Adewole described the ambassador 's visit as " auspicious and timely in the history of Nigeria . " He said " our country must gladly engage the French @-@ speaking countries , if we really want to maintain security for the citizenry . I believe that creating a long @-@ term security should be our main concern just as the initiative of our president was so strategic , having recently visited France . "

 On 12 October 2015 , Adewole was nominated as Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by Muhammadu Buhari . The Academic Staff Union of Universities ( <unk> ) lauded his nomination and described him as a " round peg in a round hole suitable for president 's change agenda " . In his remarks , chairman of the union Professor Olusegun <unk> described the nomination as a " right step towards the change that Nigeria needs by appointing change agents who have achieved global recognition in their chosen academic career and have unblemished administrative records " . 
 The Guardian reported that Dr. <unk> <unk> , the National Treasurer of the Union , said that 
 the story of Prof. Adewole ' IFA ' as we popularly called him is the story of someone who has been destined to serve humanity . His achievements as a provost of the college of medicine made him to receive overwhelming support from the university community when he indicated interest to serve on the university governing council and later on as vice chancellor . As vice chancellor , he totally turned the university around in terms of staff and student welfare , academically , University of Ibadan unarguably became the best in Nigeria and one of the best in Africa . 
 In the same vein , the chairman of the University of Ibadan Senior Staff Association of Universities Wale <unk> said " the nomination of Prof. Isaac <unk> Adewole as a minister was received by the university of Ibadan community with great enthusiasm . We can vouch for his professional pedigree and administrative competence . " 
 On 11 November 2015 , Adewole was appointed as minister of health in Buhari 's administration . He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari 's health agenda . According to The Nation , Adewole said 
 for the apex policy on health to be achieved , we need to work together and working together means we can make a huge difference . We have been described as a generation that enjoyed better health when we were young than now and our aim is to bring back the health care system we enjoyed when we were young .

 = Alta Airport = 
 Alta Airport ( Norwegian : Alta lufthavn ; IATA : ALF , ICAO : <unk> ) is an international airport serving Alta , a town and municipality in Finnmark county , Norway . The airport is located at Elvebakken , 4 kilometers ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) northeast of <unk> in Alta . It has a single , 2 @,@ 253 @-@ meter ( 7 @,@ 392 ft ) runway numbered 11 / 29 , which lies on the southern shore of the Altafjord . Alta Airport is owned and operated by the state @-@ owned Avinor , and served 368 @,@ 393 passengers in 2014 , making it the busiest airport in Finnmark . 
 The airport is served by Norwegian Air Shuttle and Scandinavian Airlines ( SAS ) with Boeing 737 aircraft on flights to Tromsø and Oslo . Widerøe operates services to several regional airports in Finnmark , feeding to the larger airlines <unk> . There are a limited number of international charter flights . The first airport in the area was a military airfield built by the Luftwaffe in 1943 , but was damaged beyond repair during World War II . The civilian airport opened on 4 May 1963 . At first services were provided by SAS to other primary airports in the north and to Oslo , but in the 1970s , several regional airports opened in Finnmark , with Widerøe flying connecting flights to them . Alta Airport 's regional importance increased in 1990 , when it became a hub for the newly created SAS Commuter . Norwegian started flying to Alta in 2003 and a new terminal building was opened in 2009 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The first airport in Alta was built by the Wehrmacht during the German occupation of Norway . Alta was a central part of the German military activity during World War II , resulting in an airstrip being constructed at Elvebakken in 1943 . The airport was damaged beyond repair under Operation Nordlicht — the German withdrawal from Finnmark in 1944 . During 1945 the Royal Norwegian Air Force operated a seaplane route along the coast of Northern Norway , which included a stop at Alta . However , the route was not resumed the following summer . The municipality started lobbying the air force and the civilian aviation authorities to establish an airline route to Alta . Specifically , they argued that both the water aerodrome at Bukta and an airfield at <unk> / Elvebakken be included in the national plans for future airports . The area at <unk> was freed up by the military in 1946 and zoned for use as an airport . 
 However , no progress was made with the airfield for over a decade . Instead , the water aerodrome at Bukta was upgraded . Initially the passengers were transported to the aircraft with a boat , but after a few years a floating dock was built . Services were only provided during five summer months , from May through September . During the rest of the year , Alta had no airline service ; travel time to Oslo was then six days , largely by ship . The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1954 , who bought a de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 3 Otter to serve a route from Tromsø via Alta to Hammerfest , Kirkenes and Vadsø . In Tromsø , the routes connected with a Norwegian Air Lines ' seaplane service to Oslo . Bukta had 2 @,@ 000 annual passengers in 1957 , and the summer route was flown daily beginning in 1960 . 
 Local politicians started discussing the airfield plans again in the mid @-@ 1950s , and an airport for Alta was included in the national airport plan launched in 1956 . The municipality started preparatory work , which included expropriation of the necessary area . At that time the plans called for two runways , 1 @,@ 000 and 800 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 and 2 @,@ 600 ft ) long , respectively . By 1958 , the municipality had also built water and sewer pipes to the airport site and had spent 60 @,@ 000 Norwegian krone on the preparatory work and purchase of land . Central authorities were at the same time looking for the most suited site for an airport for western Finnmark , and were considering Lakselv Airport , Banak in Porsanger , a by @-@ then @-@ closed military air base . 
 The location in Elvebakken was somewhat controversial in Alta , especially as the airport would be located so close to the town center , potentially causing noise pollution . An alternative at <unk> was considered , but this was discarded because the surrounding mountains prevented good landing conditions . The decision to build Alta Airport was made in 1961 , followed by additional expropriation of land . Construction was carried out simultaneously with that of Banak and Kirkenes Airport , Høybuktmoen , which combined would give Finnmark three primary airports . 
 Construction started in February 1962 and cost NOK 3 @.@ 2 million . The runway was completed by the fall of that year , but other parts of the construction were delayed . By late April 1963 , the airport was lacking fire fighting equipment and ground crew had still not received sufficient training . However , the issues were resolved , allowing the airport to open on schedule on 4 May 1963 . Lakselv and Kirkenes Airport also opened the same day , while Tromsø Airport opened the following year . Several important facilities were missing from Alta Airport when it opened ; the control tower and the passenger terminal were not completed until 1964 , so at first a shed was used as terminal . 
 = = = Operational history = = = 
 Services were at first operated by Scandinavian Airlines System ( SAS ) . At the beginning the airline used 56 @-@ passenger Convair CV @-@ 440 Metropolitan aircraft , which flew flights south to Oslo and westward to Lakselv and Kirkenes — and also to Tromsø starting in 1964 . The general route scheme of flying multi @-@ legged flights from Oslo to Finnmark remained until 1990 . On 7 April 1969 , SAS introduced the 85 @-@ passenger Douglas DC @-@ 9 @-@ 21 jetliner on the Alta service ; the last Metropolitan flew on 1 April 1970 . Five regional airports opened on 1 August 1974 , Sørkjosen , Hammerfest , Mehamn , Berlevåg and Vadsø , all which were connected to Alta and other primary airports by Widerøe using de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 6 Twin Otters . Honningsvåg Airport opened on 1 July 1977 . SAS ' traffic increased throughout the 1970s , resulting in SAS gradually increasing the frequency of its services , and later also using larger DC @-@ 9s . The McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 80 was first flown on the Alta route on 11 July 1986 . 
 SAS Commuter was established in 1988 and started operations in Northern Norway in May 1990 , making Alta its central hub for Finnmark . This involved a change to the operations so that all DC @-@ 9 services from Alta to Oslo were flown non @-@ stop . Conversely , all services to airports in Northern Norway were flown using the smaller Fokker 50 . Thus SAS was able to reduce costs by no longer operating local routes with the DC @-@ 9 / MD @-@ 80 and instead increased the number of flights . The change made Alta the only airport in Finnmark with direct services to Oslo . From 1989 to 1990 , the number of annual aircraft movements at Alta hiked from 7 @,@ 711 to 10 @,@ 035 . 
 Activity at Alta Airport peaked in the following years . SAS served Alta with up to ten daily services ; at peak hours six aircraft were at the airport simultaneously , including two from Widerøe . From 1992 , SAS reintroduced direct services from Kirkenes to Oslo , and aircraft in eastern Finnmark again started feeding into Kirkenes . The hub paradigm was thus gradually abandoned by SAS . Flights at Alta gradually decreased , hitting a low of 4 @,@ 935 movements ( landings and take @-@ offs ) in 2000 . The North Cape Tunnel opened in 1999 , connecting Honningsvåg and Nordkapp to the mainland . This reduced travel time to Alta and people from Nordkapp started using Alta more for long @-@ haul flights at the expense of Honningsvåg Airport . 
 SAS bought Braathens in 2001 , resulting in the latter taking over the service to Oslo starting on 1 April 2002 . All SAS Commuter services in Northern Norway were taken over by Widerøe in October 2002 . Norwegian Air Shuttle started its services from Oslo to Alta on 19 August 2003 , initially with three services daily . SAS and Braathens merged in 2004 to form SAS Braathens ; the airline changed its name back to Scandinavian Airlines in 2007 . 
 Plans for expanding the 1 @,@ 670 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 18 @,@ 000 sq ft ) terminal facilities were first articulated by the Civil Airport Administration in the 1990s . The upgrade was given priority in a 2000 plan , but was shortly after placed on hold in favor of upgrades of Kirkenes Airport and Svalbard Airport , Longyear . By 2005 the Civil Aviation Authority announced that the aircraft parking areas at Alta were too close to the runway and that the airport would lose its certification in 2008 unless it was upgraded . Another concern was the lack of capacity , as the airport could only handle 150 passengers simultaneously at two gates . 
 Avinor decided in February 2007 to build a new passenger terminal and tower for NOK 300 million . The new terminal was 5 @,@ 000 square meters ( 54 @,@ 000 sq ft ) and was located between the old terminal and the port facilities . It included improved facilities for security control and allowed international services . The new terminal was put into use on 23 October 2009 and was officially opened on 25 September . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 The airport is located at Elvebakken and <unk> , on the southern shore of the Altafjord and at the mouth of the river of <unk> , which is about 4 kilometers ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) east of <unk> in the town of Alta . Operated by the state @-@ owned Avinor , it has a single 2 @,@ 253 @-@ meter ( 7 @,@ 392 ft ) runway aligned 11 – 29 ( roughly east – west ) , without a taxiway . Both directions are equipped with instrument landing system category I. The terminal building is 5 @,@ 000 square meters ( 54 @,@ 000 sq ft ) and can handle international flights . In 2013 , the airport had 368 @,@ 393 passengers , 11 @,@ 707 aircraft movements ( landings and take @-@ offs ) and 330 tonnes of cargo , making it the busiest airport in Finnmark . 
 The <unk> bus is operated by Boreal Transport and takes ten minutes to the town center . Taxis and car rental is also available at the airport . There are 520 long @-@ term parking spaces at the airport . From Alta to Hammerfest there are both coach and fast ferry services ; travel time to Hammerfest is two hours . 
 = = Airlines and destinations = = 
 Alta Airport is served by three scheduled airlines and two charter airlines , providing services to eleven destinations , including two abroad . Both Scandinavian Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle serve the airport using Boeing 737 aircraft , each providing two daily services to Oslo and one daily service to Tromsø . Widerøe operates regional services in Finnmark on a public service obligation contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications . However , its seven daily services to Tromsø are not subsidized . Widerøe operates de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft on their services , using the 50 @-@ passenger Dash 8 @-@ 300 aircraft to Tromsø and the 39 @-@ passenger Dash 8 @-@ 100 aircraft on services to regional airport . 
 Alta Airport 's catchment area includes Kautokeino ( 135 kilometers or 84 miles by road ) , which has no airport . The catchment area partially includes Hammerfest ( 137 kilometers or 85 miles by road ) and Kvalsund ( 106 kilometers or 66 miles ) . Both of these areas have Hammerfest Airport as their local airport , but the regional airport does not provide direct flights to Oslo and the prices to Tromsø are higher . In 2007 , an estimated 81 @,@ 000 passenger @-@ flights at Alta Airport were generated by people living in Hammerfest and Kvalsund . Also journeys to and from other parts of western Finnmark to Alta Airport are often made via Alta , for example from the area around Honningsvåg Airport . The pass at <unk> is sometimes closed during snow storms . 
 = = Future = = 
 A proposal by a consultant company , ordered by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in 2011 , suggested that starting in 2013 the subsidized routes in Finnmark should follow a coastal route , leaving those to Kirkenes and the county capital of Vadsø as the only subsidized routes remaining at Alta . There are proposals to build a new airport for Hammerfest at Grøtnes , either with a 1 @,@ 999 or 1 @,@ 199 meters ( 6 @,@ 558 or 3 @,@ 934 ft ) runway . If the former is selected , Hammerfest could serve direct flights to Oslo . This would severely reduce Alta 's catchment area as a primary airport and could result in a reduction in Oslo flights . The Norwegian government has decided not to build the Hammerfest @-@ Grøtnes airport , and instead improve the Alta @-@ Hammerfest road which started 2015 . Also the roads towards Kautokeino and Tromsø are being improved during the period 2010 – 2019 .

 Grand Theft Auto III is an open world action @-@ adventure video game developed by DMA Design and published by Rockstar Games . It was released on 22 October 2001 for the PlayStation 2 , on 20 May 2002 for Microsoft Windows , and on 31 October 2003 for the Xbox , and re @-@ released an anniversary version on <unk> platforms in 2011 . It is the fifth title in the Grand Theft Auto series , and the first main entry since 1999 's Grand Theft Auto 2 . Set within the fictional Liberty City , based on New York City , the game follows Claude after he is left for dead and quickly becomes entangled in a world of gangs , crime and corruption . 
 The game is played from a third @-@ person perspective and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle . The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City , consisting of three main islands . Development was shared between DMA Design in Edinburgh and Rockstar in New York . Much of the development work constituted transforming popular series elements into a 3D world . The game was delayed following the September 11 attacks , to allow the team to change references and gameplay deemed inappropriate . 
 Upon release , the game received critical acclaim , with praise particularly directed at its concept and gameplay . However , the game also generated controversy , with criticism directed at the depiction of violence and sexual content . Grand Theft Auto III became the best @-@ selling video game of 2001 , and has sold over 17 million copies . Considered one of the most significant titles of the sixth generation of video games , and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time , it won year @-@ end accolades , including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications . Since its release , it has received numerous ports to many gaming platforms . Its successor , Grand Theft Auto : Vice City , was released in October 2002 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Grand Theft Auto III is an action @-@ adventure game played from a third @-@ person view . Players complete missions — linear scenarios with set objectives — to progress through the story . It is possible to have several active missions running at one time , as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events . Outside of missions , players can freely roam the game 's open world , and have the ability to complete option side missions . Liberty City is composed of three boroughs : Portland , Staunton Island , and <unk> Vale ; the islands are unlocked to players as the story progresses . 
 Players may run , jump or use vehicles to navigate the game 's world . In combat , auto @-@ aim can be used as assistance against enemies . Should players take damage , their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick @-@ ups . Body armour can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage , but is used up in the process . When health is entirely depleted , gameplay stops , and players respawn at the nearest hospital , at the expense of losing all weapons and armour , and an amount of money . 
 If players commit crimes while playing , the game 's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a " wanted " meter in the head @-@ up display ( HUD ) . On the meter , the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level ( for example , at the maximum six @-@ star level , efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive ) . Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity . The wanted meter enters a cooldown mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers ' line of sight . 
 The game lets players control the mute criminal Claude . During the story , Claude meets various new characters from gangs . As players completes missions for different gangs , fellow gang members will often defend players , while rival gang members will recognise players and subsequently shoot on sight . While free roaming the game world , players may engage in activities such as a vigilante minigame , a fire fighting activity , and a taxi cab service . Completion of these activities grants players with context @-@ specific rewards ; for example , completing the vigilante mission allows players to bribe police after committing a crime . 
 Players use melee attacks , firearms and explosives to fight enemies . The firearms include weapons such as the Micro Uzi , an M16 rifle and a flamethrower . The game 's three @-@ dimension environment allows a first @-@ person view while aiming with the sniper rifle and rocket launcher . In addition , the game 's combat was reworked to allow players to commit drive @-@ by shootings by facing sideways in a vehicle . The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options — they can be purchased from local firearms dealers , found on the ground , retrieved from dead enemies , or found around the city . 
 = = Plot = = 
 While robbing a bank in Liberty City , ambitious criminal Claude is shot and betrayed by his girlfriend and accomplice Catalina ( Cynthia Farrell ) . Although he survives the wound , Claude is arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison . While being transported in a prison van , Claude and fellow prisoner 8 @-@ Ball ( Guru ) are inadvertently freed after an attack on the police convoy , and escape to a safehouse . 8 @-@ Ball later introduces Claude to the Leone Mafia crime family ; Sex Club 7 owner Luigi <unk> ( Joe Pantoliano ) , Don Salvatore Leone ( Frank Vincent ) , his Capo Toni Cipriani ( Michael Madsen ) , and the Don 's son Joey Leone ( Michael Rapaport ) . During work for the family , Claude finds himself fighting the Colombians , who are being led by Catalina in proliferating a new drug . Meanwhile , Salvatore 's trophy wife Maria ( Debi Mazar ) begins to take a liking to Claude . Salvatore grows suspicious and betrays Claude into luring him to a death trap , but Maria saves him just in time and they both flee . 
 Claude then begins working for the city 's Yakuza and its leader Asuka Kasen ( <unk> Pai ) , Maria 's close friend , who has Claude assassinate Salvatore and get his revenge . This cuts off all of Claude 's ties with the Leone family , who are now against him . Claude 's work leads him to allying himself with other criminal sources , such as corrupt police detective Ray <unk> ( Robert Loggia ) , an enemy of the Cartel . Claude later saves him from Internal Affairs and the CIA by helping him flee to Vice City . Claude also meets charismatic media mogul Donald Love ( Kyle MacLachlan ) , who maintains a huge media front . In an effort to start a war between the Yakuza and Cartel , Claude and Love organise the death of Asuka 's brother Kenji Kasen ( Les Mau ) and blame the Cartel . Later , Love asks Claude to rescue a man who was kidnapped by the Cartel in the prison truck that Claude was in . While on an errand , Claude finally confronts Catalina , who narrowly escapes . Asuka abducts Catalina 's partner Miguel ( Al Espinosa ) , believing him to have knowledge of her brother 's death . 
 With the war with the Cartel intensifying , Asuka and Maria learn of Claude 's history with Catalina and order him to attack many Cartel operations . Eventually , his exploits attract the attention of Catalina . As a result , the Cartel kidnap Maria , murder Asuka and Miguel , and demand Claude to pay a $ 500 @,@ 000 ransom in exchange for Maria 's release . When Claude confronts Catalina , she attempts to have him killed , but he escapes . In the resulting firefight , Catalina attempts to flee in a helicopter and makes a final attempt on Claude 's life . After killing the remaining Cartel members and rescuing Maria , Claude shoots down the helicopter , effectively killing Catalina . As they are leaving the scene , Maria complains to Claude about the kidnapping , particularly the state of her clothes and nails . During the credits , a gunshot is heard , and Maria 's voice is silenced .

 The core development team of Grand Theft Auto III consisted of about 23 people at DMA Design in Edinburgh , who worked closely with publisher Rockstar Games in New York . By early 2001 , the team had designed the city , cars , and some weapons . An online multiplayer mode was initially planned for the game , but was ultimately dropped due to time and resource limitations . Producer Leslie Benzies described Grand Theft Auto III as a " crime simulation game " . When porting the game to Microsoft Windows , the team delayed it from the PlayStation 2 release in order to ensure quality , citing issues with the simultaneous platform release of previous Grand Theft Auto games . 
 = = = Open world design = = = 
 Grand Theft Auto III is the first 3D game in the series , using Criterion Games ' RenderWare game engine . When designing the game , the development team expanded upon concepts introduced in the previous Grand Theft Auto games . Benzies stated that the intention was to recreate the " freedom and diversity " of the previous games in a " living , breathing 3D world " , using the power of the PlayStation 2 to do so . The console 's ability to use DVDs , an improvement over the PlayStation 's limit to CDs , allowed the team to store more data , such as animations , music and environments . Despite this , the team found it difficult to fit the game into 32 megabytes , due to the scale . The game 's size also created difficulties for the testers , due to the variety of options . Benzies felt that creating a living city was the " underlying principle " of the game 's concept during development . Executive producer Sam Houser felt that the game 's 3D element allowed the " chemistry of the team [ to come ] together perfectly for the first time " . 
 A major difficulty the team encountered was converting all game elements into a 3D world , including the sound and radio stations , as well as designing and voicing the non @-@ player characters , due to the amount that existed within the open world ; producer Dan Houser said that there was about 8 @,@ 000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game , while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18 @,@ 000 . The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid @-@ 2000 , with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable streaming model . Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry , but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered . 
 When designing the game world , the team initially created a " hybrid city " , which producer Dan Houser describes as " a post industrial Midwest slash east coast generic " city . Upon developing within this game world , the team realised that basing the design on a real location meant " you have a lot of things you can say about it " . As a result , the team redesigned Liberty City , which had been previously featured in Grand Theft Auto ( 1997 ) , basing it loosely on New York City . The city is broken into three islands : an industrial section representing Brooklyn and Queens , a commercial center resembling Manhattan , and suburbs similar to New Jersey . The islands unlock as the story progresses ; the team wanted players to " start out feeling poor and work to being richer " . Dan Houser describes Liberty City as a " hybrid of a generic American city " , including Chicago , Pittsburgh , Detroit , New York , and Philadelphia . He felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously . Sam Houser cited films and shows like Heat ( 1995 ) and The Sopranos ( 1999 – 2007 ) as inspiration for the setting , and wanted to emulate them in the game . He also cited the influence of the The Legend of Zelda series ( 1986 – present ) and the film Goodfellas ( 1990 ) , describing Grand Theft Auto III as " a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG " . 
 = = = Story and characters = = = 
 The team developed the story and design simultaneously . " We use the story to expose the mechanics , and we use the mechanics to tell the story , " said Dan Houser . Houser found it difficult to create the narrative , as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom . He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic " rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy " . The game 's script was also focused on mission objectives , attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity . Houser felt that each mission is " its own short story " , and part of an " overarching story " . Houser and co @-@ writer James Worrall drew influence from mob films , and the mafiosi featured in films by Martin Scorsese . When writing the story , Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers , and filled a room with post @-@ it notes to reconstruct the story components to shape the game . 
 Many of the game characters were animated using motion capture , filmed at a rented studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard , though this was limited by technical restraints . The character movement was also treated as being cinematic , though limited polygons heavily inhibited this . Animating non @-@ player characters entering and driving cars proved to be difficult for the team , due to the variety of vehicle designs . " It involved chaining together dozens of different animations and altering key frames in code , " recalled software engineer Alan Campbell . The team used varying camera angles when animated the game 's cutscenes , in order to evoke different emotions . For the voice acting , the team wanted " natural , subtle performances " , which proved difficult as many of the actors " had in their head the idea that because video games are animated their performances needed to be animated " , explained motion capture director Navid Khonsari . The game 's playable protagonist is unnamed in the game , and his name is not officially revealed as Claude until his appearance in Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas ( 2004 ) . He is a silent protagonist , never speaking throughout his appearances . The team decided to make Claude silent primarily because it " did not seem like a major issue " , due to the other challenges faced during development , and also partly to allow players to identify with the character .

 Grand Theft Auto III features about three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours of in @-@ game radio material . For the music , the team sought a broad diversity , to recreate the real sensation of skipping through radio stations , reflecting the gangster movie culture invoked by the game . The team used the talk radio stations to add character to the city , and provide a " unique take on American life " ; Sam Houser described it as " a very iconoclastic look at America " . The team used real DJs to portray those on the radio . In doing so , the team wrote unusual dialogue for the DJs , seeking the effect of " high production values and absurd content " . Music director Craig Conner assembled the assets of the radio station — music , advertisements , DJ dialogue , station imaging . 
 = = = Cuts , changes , and the 9 / 11 effect = = = 
 Prior to the initial release , several modifications were made to the game . While changes are frequent during game development , the changes in Grand Theft Auto III were noted to be around the time of the September 11 , 2001 attacks , which led to speculation that some changes were motivated by the attacks . On September 19 , 2001 , Rockstar delayed the game 's release by three weeks , citing the attacks as an influencing factor in the delay . " Everyone had someone who had an uncle or brother [ who was impacted by the attack ] " , said Paul Eibeler , then @-@ president of distributor Take @-@ Two Interactive . 
 One of the changes made shortly after 9 / 11 was the colour scheme of the police cars ; the original colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the New York City Police Department . It was changed to a generic black @-@ and @-@ white design common among several police departments in the United States , such as Los Angeles and San Francisco . Other changes include altering the flight path of a plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper , removing a mission referencing terrorists , as well as some changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio . 
 Another cut to the game is the character of <unk> , a revolutionary urchin who vowed to bring down the city 's economy . When references to <unk> were found in the game 's code , speculation arose that the character was related to 9 / 11 , however Dan Houser explained that the character had been cut " months before [ release ] " . There are also reports and previews stating that the game featured school children as pedestrians prior to release , although Rockstar has dismissed such rumours as " nonsense " . 
 Rockstar stated that the game was " about 1 % different " after 9 / 11 , and that the biggest change was the cover art . They felt that the original cover , which was ultimately released as the cover in Europe , felt " too raw " after 9 / 11 , and was changed into what became the " signature style " of the series . Sam Houser claims that the cover was designed in an evening , and was instantly preferred over the original cover . The cover was inspired by the movie posters for 1960s films , such as The Thomas Crown Affair ( 1968 ) .

 Prior to and since the release of Grand Theft Auto III , the game generated several controversies . GameSpy awarded Grand Theft Auto III with Most Offensive Game of the Year , calling it " absolutely reprehensible " . They wrote that the game rewards players for " causing mayhem " and " killing innocent people by the dozen " , ultimately questioning its appropriateness within the industry . The notoriety of Grand Theft Auto III resulted in Wal @-@ Mart 's decision to check the identification of purchasers who appeared to be under the age of 17 , when purchasing mature titles . In an essay , assistant professor Shira Chess identified the lack of conclusion to player violence , due to the ability to respawn upon death or incarceration , and found that it denies the " reality of mortality and simultaneously [ forces ] it on players " . When speaking about the game 's depiction of violence , producer Leslie Benzies claims that is intended as comedic , and that the game is " not meant to be taken seriously " . Producer Dan Houser stated that the team was conscious of the offence that the game would attract , but " never marketed it in a way that exploited that " . 
 The game allows players to commit sexual activities with prostitutes , and murder them to reclaim the payment . This was met with widespread controversy . The game also received controversy for its depiction of crime , and allowing violence against police officers . Psychologist David Walsh of the National Institute on Media and the Family stated that the game " <unk> antisocial and criminal activity " , and that " the purpose of the game is to perpetrate crime " . In response , Kotaku writer Owen Good wrote that the game does not reward players for " proficiency at crime , no matter how much it is accused of doing so " . Joanna Weiss of The Boston Globe noted the " adrenaline " that players feel when committing crimes in the game , excusing the game 's violence due to its mature classification . The National Organization for Women spoke out against the game in January 2002 , asking Rockstar and Take @-@ Two to withdraw the game from sale as it " encourages violence and the degradation of women " . Matt <unk> of The New York Times wrote that the activities within the game " crossed the line into bad taste " . 
 Grand Theft Auto III was initially released in Australia with an MA15 + classification . After re @-@ reviewing the game , the Office of Film and Literature Classification ( OFLC ) banned it , due to its depiction of sexual content and violence to prostitutes . This prompted distributor Take @-@ Two Interactive to appeal to the OFLC , who reaffirmed the banned status on December 11 , 2001 , after <unk> the game and seeking the professional opinion of a forensic psychologist . This prompted Take @-@ Two to recall the game in Australia , and Rockstar to make appropriate changes to the game ; a modified version was re @-@ released with an MA15 + classification in January 2002 , removing all instances of sexual acts with prostitutes . 
 On 25 June 2003 , teenage stepbrothers William and Josh Buckner shot and killed Aaron Hamel and Kimberly Bede . In statements to investigators , the <unk> claimed their actions were inspired by Grand Theft Auto III . In response , on 20 October 2003 , the families of Hamel and Bede filed a US $ 246 million lawsuit against Rockstar Games , Take @-@ Two Interactive , Sony Computer Entertainment and Wal @-@ Mart . Rockstar and Take @-@ Two filed for dismissal of the lawsuit , stating in United States district court on 29 October 2003 that the " ideas and concepts " , and the " purported psychological effects " of the perpetrators , are protected by the First Amendment 's free @-@ speech clause .

 = Light House : A Trifle = 
 Light House : A Trifle , a 2000 satirical novel by American screenwriter William Monahan . Originally serialized in the Amherst literary magazine Old Crow Review from 1993 to 1995 , Monahan sold Light House to Riverhead Books , a Penguin Group imprint , in 1998 . Warner Bros. optioned the film rights while the novel was in manuscript and hired Monahan to write the screenplay adaptation . The novel was delayed for two years , with plans to release it alongside the upcoming film ; however , the film was never produced . 
 In 2000 , Light House : A Trifle was finally published and garnered critical acclaim : The New York Times proclaimed " Monahan 's cocksure prose gallops along " , and <unk> Fiction called Monahan " a worthy successor to Kingsley Amis " . The story follows an artist named Tim Picasso who runs afoul of a drug lord and seeks refuge at a New England inn in the middle of a nor 'easter . It is a work intentionally referential to the satirical novels of the early 19th @-@ century British author Thomas Love Peacock , such as Headlong Hall and Nightmare Abbey . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The story begins with a painter named Tim Picasso who suffers critical rejection from his peers and decides to take a break in the Caribbean , where he ends up crewing on a drug smuggling sailboat . When the captain gets drunk and falls overboard , Picasso takes the boat to Florida , and meets up with Jesus Castro , the lead drug smuggler . Castro intimidates Picasso into running the drugs from Miami to Boston , however after Picasso collects the $ 1 @.@ 5 million payment from the Irish Republican Army , he escapes by train to the New England town of Tyburn , where a winter storm is picking up force . He decides to lodge at the seaside Admiral Benbow Inn for the weekend , until he can depart for Italy . 
 Meanwhile , Mr. Glowery , a bitter New York journalist and writer who believes that a rival author is sabotaging his literary career , arrives in Tyburn where he is to speak at a fiction workshop being held at the Admiral Benbow Inn . He is immediately tasered by one of Castro 's detectives , who mistakenly confuses him for Picasso . Back at the Admiral Benbow Inn , the innkeeper , George Hawthorne , worries about Mr. Briscoe , a cross @-@ dressing contract worker who is stranded in the abandoned lighthouse just off the coast because of the raging nor 'easter , while his unhappy wife , Magdalene Hawthorne , threatens to leave him . The next morning , Mr. Glowery is stuck in a restaurant where he is being coerced by a psychotic cook to peddle his novel in order to pay off a debt he incurred during the night . When Professor Eggman , the director of the fiction workshop , comes across Mr. Glowery , he rescues him and brings him back to the inn . However , few people show up for the fiction workshop because of the storm . Hawthorne 's wife returns from a spa with Picasso ; Mr. Hawthorne informs her that he is trying to procure a prostitute for his new arrival , Jesus Castro , who has registered under the false name of Mr. Wassermann . Mr. Hawthorne asks Picasso if he has had sex with his wife and Picasso meekly admits to it . 
 At the lighthouse , Mr. Briscoe decides to brave the storm in a landing craft , but is immediately swamped with water and carried by the tide towards the mainland . After Castro avails himself of the services of a prostitute , he rampages around the property searching for Picasso . The storm crashes through the inn . A guest is killed by a billiards table that falls on top of him and is dragged off into the sea . Mr. Glowery is also dragged off into the sea by the storm . Castro and his assistant round up the guests and interrogate them about the location of the $ 1 @.@ 5 million Picasso stole . In another part of the inn a fire starts . Finally , Mr. Briscoe shows up and kills Castro 's assistant before knocking Castro unconscious . While Hawthorne learns his wife is leaving him for the prostitute , the inn becomes completely engulfed in flames . Picasso , Hawthorne , and Briscoe motor a lobster boat over to the lighthouse , and dump Castro 's dead assistant into the sea along with Castro himself , weighed down with two cinder blocks chained to his ankles . When they land on the island , Briscoe runs into the lighthouse and blows himself up . Amongst the rubble of the lighthouse , Picasso notices the inscription " <unk> D <unk> " painted on one of the surrounding rocks and says to the innkeeper " He 's been thinking about this for some time , George .

 = = Publication history = = 
 Monahan wrote the novel while studying Elizabethan and Jacobean drama at the University of Massachusetts Amherst . Monahan completed a draft of Light House on May 18 , 1991 , but then " stuck it in a drawer " . It remained unpublished until 1993 when he gave it to the literary magazine Old Crow Review to serialize to benefit a food charity . In 1995 , a short review from an editor at Factsheet Five described the serial run of Light House as a " gritty screwball comedy set in a Massachusetts coastal hotel during a raging winter storm " that is " very , very funny " . 
 After the original serialization of Light House , Monahan reluctantly rewrote the novel several times at the urging of his agent in New York City . In 1998 Light House was sold to Riverhead Books , an imprint of Penguin Putnam , and Warner Bros. immediately optioned the film rights while the novel was still in manuscript . Penguin Putnam wanted to delay publishing the novel in order to release it concurrent with the anticipated film release . Warner Bros. hired Monahan to write the screenplay adaptation of Light House . 
 In 2000 , Light House : A Trifle was finally published in hardcover , and then , the following year , in paperback . Monahan and Bruno Maddox , a fellow former Spy editor , went on a joint book tour billed as the " Minor Novelists Tour " that was interrupted by the 9 / 11 attacks . 
 Less than four years after the novel 's publication , Monahan bought back the film rights to Light House " I didn 't like how the book was published . They wanted to wait for the movie to be made . I got a little hostile . When I was in Spain on Kingdom , I realized I could buy it back . It was an empty , damaging gesture . " In an interview with Collider.com he stated that , " It was demoralizing to write a really good book and to realize how little the rewards were , even though the book did quite well , as far as first novels are concerned . " Light House was available in a German edition , translated by Ulrike <unk> .

 = = Literary significance and reception = = 
 Light House intentionally references the satirical novels of the early 19th @-@ century British author and satirist Thomas Love Peacock , such as Headlong Hall and Nightmare Abbey . Peacock 's novels have little plot and are best known for parodying the intellectual modes and pretenses of his contemporaries ; his characters normally assemble in characteristic English country houses and predominantly engage in conversation . Nightmare Abbey satirized the English romantic movement and included characters based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Lord Byron , and Percy Bysshe Shelley . 
 When Light House was published in 2000 it was critically acclaimed , however , it had lackluster sales . William Georgiades , in a review for The New York Times , called it " a sort of old English farce that allows Monahan [ … ] to skewer whatever comes to mind : modern art , magazine writing , education , the young " . The Chicago Sun @-@ Times construed the storyline as one that " allows Monahan to indulge in wisecracks , lampoons and slurs of seemingly infinite variety " with " literary and artistic pretenders [ taking ] heavy fire " . Mark <unk> of the Los Angeles Times praised Monahan 's " refreshing disregard for believability , making Light House — which contains asides on Freud , Emerson , race and fiction itself — a seriously adult cartoon " . 
 <unk> Fiction 's Bruce Tierney called Monahan " a worthy successor to Kingsley Amis " and Alfred Alcorn of the Boston Herald detected " delightful echoes of Vladimir Nabokov , Kingsley Amis , Evelyn Waugh , Flann O 'Brien and other modern masters of drollery " in the novel , concluding that " [ i ] n the end , the girl gets the girl , the bad guys lose , and an old Yankee blows himself up with the eponymous lighthouse and a few chunks of the Virginia Woolf legacy " . 
 After describing the women in Light House as " mainly vehicles for sex " and the men as " mostly hapless " , The Boston Globe 's Jules <unk> generalized that the entire cast of characters appeared to be created " simply so that [ Monahan ] can skewer them " , allowing that " it makes for a pretty good spectator sport " .

 His fiancée is determined to prove his innocence , but knows not how to establish it . She meets a homeless man , who closely resembles Jack , who is about to commit a crime by smashing a window . The man desires to go to prison , believing it to be the only way that he will have food and shelter . The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison . The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via change of clothes . Jack , now free , confronts the aunt — who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one . The aunt confesses that the baron 's wounds were self @-@ inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous . The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known . For his plot , the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison .

 The only known credit for the film is that it starred William Garwood . Film historian , Q. David Bowers notes that the plot dealing with circumstantial evidence focused on one of Lloyd Lonergan 's social issues . Lonergan would produce several scenarios featuring the problems with circumstantial evidence being used to obtain convictions . Bowers notes that such convictions were a known social issue , but not a pressing one in 1911 . The first such Thanhouser film to tackle the subject was Love and Law released in December 1910 . Love and Law was a film which garnered some criticism for an improbable plot . Checkmate wove a more tangled web of circumstantial evidence and intrigue and the resolution comes not from an astute female detective , but by the heiress 's novel substitution of a doppelgänger to the prison so that the original can get the needed confession . The serious nature of the film was highlighted with the advertising of the film by Thanhouser which states , " Checkmate carries a message and a lesson to those who value the ' circumstantial evidence ' process by which so many convictions are obtained in our criminal courts . The reel demonstrates how easily evidence of this sort may be made to entangle and ensnare a totally innocent man ... "

 The single reel drama , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on February 17 , 1911 . The film was met with a wide variety of reviews by critics ; with the majority proving to be negative . The Morning Telegraph , like others , found the story to be foolish and completely improbable on many accounts . While the reviewer stated that no magistrate would have sent the man to jail for assault with a blunt knife , it was the jail substitution via a changing of clothes which proved to be impossible . H. <unk> of The Moving Picture News found the baron to be boorish by shading a lady 's hand with a glove on and wondered at how Thanhouser was able to film the prison scenes . Walton , also of The Moving Picture News summed up the film and stated , " Good teaching as to woman 's ' class ' , but as to details [ , ] sadly lax . " The New York Dramatic Mirror panned the film beginning with , " Nothing more improbable or inconsistent has been seen on the screen in some time ... " The reviewer concluded the review of the improbable plot as to having been " dreamed up by a ten @-@ year @-@ old girl . " 
 The film is presumed lost because the film is not known to be held in any archive or by any collector . 
 = Tube Alloys = 
 Tube Alloys was a codename of the clandestine research and development programme , authorised by the United Kingdom , with participation from Canada , to develop nuclear weapons during the Second World War . Starting before the Manhattan Project in the United States , the British efforts were kept classified and as such had to be referred to by code even within the highest circles of government . 
 The possibility of nuclear weapons was acknowledged early in the war . At the University of Birmingham , Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch co @-@ wrote a memorandum explaining that a small mass of pure uranium @-@ 235 could be used to produce a chain reaction in a bomb with the power of thousands of tons of TNT . This led to the formation of the MAUD Committee , which called for an all @-@ out effort to develop nuclear weapons . Wallace Akers , who oversaw the project , chose the deliberately misleading name " Tube Alloys " . His Tube Alloys Directorate was part of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research . 
 The Tube Alloys programme in Britain and Canada was the first nuclear weapons project . Due to the high costs , and the fact that Britain was fighting a war within bombing range of its enemies , Tube Alloys was ultimately subsumed into the Manhattan Project . Despite reaching an agreement with the United States to share nuclear weapons technology , and to refrain from using it against each other , or against other countries without mutual consent , the details were not completely provided to the United Kingdom . The Soviet Union gained valuable information through its atomic spies , who had infiltrated both the British and American projects . 
 The United States terminated cooperation after the war ended . This prompted the United Kingdom to ( re ) launch its own project . Production facilities were established and British scientists continued their work under the auspices of an independent British programme . Finally in 1952 , Britain performed a nuclear test under codename Operation Hurricane . In 1958 , after British demonstration of a two @-@ stage thermonuclear bomb , the United Kingdom and the United States signed an agreement that resulted in a resumption of Britain 's nuclear special relationship with the United States .

 = = = Discovery of fission = = = 
 In December 1938 , Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann conducted experiments in Hahn 's laboratory in Berlin @-@ Dahlem that involved bombarding uranium with slowed neutrons . They discovered that barium had been produced , and therefore that the uranium nucleus had been split . Atoms had been split before , by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in 1932 ; but they had split lithium atoms with accelerated protons . The neutron had only been discovered by James Chadwick at Cavendish in 1932 . 
 Experiments with bombardment of elements by slow neutrons had always produced heavier elements and isotopes . Hahn wrote to colleague Lise Meitner . In collaboration with her nephew , Otto Frisch , Meitner developed a theoretical justification for the process , based on Niels Bohr 's liquid drop model of the atom , which they published in Nature in 1939 . This phenomenon was a new type of nuclear disintegration and was radioactively more powerful than ever seen before . Frisch and Meitner calculated this energy released by each fission to be approximately 200 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 electron volts . The process resembled the division of biological cells , so they decided to name it " fission " . 
 = = = Paris Group = = = 
 This was followed up by a group of scientists at the Collège de France in Paris : Frédéric Joliot @-@ Curie , Hans von Halban , Lew Kowarski , and Francis Perrin . In February 1939 , the Paris Group showed that when fission occurs in uranium , two or three extra neutrons are given off . This important observation suggested that a self @-@ sustaining nuclear chain reaction might be possible . It was immediately apparent to many scientists that , in theory , an extremely powerful explosive could be created , although most thought a practical bomb was an impossibility . The term " atomic bomb " was already familiar to the British public through the writings of H. G. Wells , in his 1913 novel The World Set Free . 
 Perrin defined a critical mass of uranium to be the smallest amount that could sustain a chain reaction . The neutrons used to cause fission in uranium are considered slow neutrons , but when neutrons are released during a fission reaction they are released as fast neutrons which have much more speed and energy . Thus , in order to create a sustained chain reaction , there existed a need for a neutron moderator to contain and slow the fast neutrons until they reached a usable energy level . The College de France found that both water and graphite could be used as acceptable moderators . 
 Early in 1940 , the Paris Group decided on theoretical grounds that heavy water would be an ideal moderator for how they intended to use it . They asked the French Minister of Armaments to obtain as much heavy water as possible from the only source , the large Norsk Hydro hydroelectric station at Vemork in Norway . The French then discovered that Germany had already offered to purchase the entire stock of Norwegian heavy water , indicating that Germany might also be researching an atomic bomb . The French told the Norwegian government of the possible military significance of heavy water . 
 Norway gave the entire stock , 187 litres ( 41 imp gal ; 49 US gal ) , to a French Secret Service agent , who secretly brought it to France , just before Germany invaded Norway in April 1940 . On 19 June 1940 , following the German invasion of France , it was shipped to England by the Earl of Suffolk and Major <unk> Golding , aboard the steamer <unk> . The heavy water , valued at £ 22 @,@ 000 , was initially kept at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs , but was subsequently secretly stored in the library at Windsor Castle . The Paris Group moved to Cambridge , with the exception of Joliot @-@ Curie , who remained in France and became active in the French Resistance . 
 = = = Frisch – Peierls memorandum = = = 
 In Britain , a number of scientists considered whether an atomic bomb was practical . At the University of Liverpool , Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat tackled the problem , but their calculations were inconclusive . At the University of Cambridge , Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore . The main source of this was the Belgian Congo , and they were worried that it could fall into German hands . Unsure as to how to go about this , they spoke to Sir William Spens , the master of Corpus Christi College , Cambridge . In April 1939 he approached Sir Kenneth <unk> , the local Member of Parliament , who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence , Major General Hastings Ismay . Ismay in turn asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion . Like many scientists , Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed , reckoning the odds against success at 100 @,@ 000 to 1 . 
 Even at such long odds , the danger was sufficiently great to be taken seriously . Lord <unk> , Minister for Coordination of Defence checked with the Treasury and Foreign Office , and found that the Belgian Congo uranium was owned by the Union Minière du Haut Katanga company , whose British vice president , Lord Stonehaven , who arranged a meeting with the president of the company , Edgar Sengier . Since Union Minière management were friendly towards Britain , it was not considered worthwhile to immediately acquire the uranium , but Tizard 's Committee on the Scientific Survey of Air Defence was directed to continue the research into the feasibility of atomic bombs . Thomson , at Imperial College London , and Mark Oliphant , an Australian physicist at the University of Birmingham , were each tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium . By February 1940 , Thomson 's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium , and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing . 
 But at Birmingham , Oliphant 's team had reached a strikingly different conclusion . Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists , Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch , who could not work on Oliphant 's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance . Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes ( 39 long tons ; 44 short tons ) . He reckoned that if a Neutron reflector were placed around it , this might be reduced to 12 tonnes ( 12 long tons ; 13 short tons ) . Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission , thus omitting consideration of moderator . He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be " of the order of tons " . 
 Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance . In the interior of a critical mass sphere , neutrons are being spontaneously produced by the fissionable material . A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei , while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere . Peierls worked at calculating the equilibrium of the system , where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number of neutrons escaping the mass . 
 However Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium @-@ 235 isotope , which makes up only about 0 @.@ 7 % of natural uranium , was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons , although this was not yet universally accepted . Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed . They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium @-@ 235 with a radius of 2 @.@ 1 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 83 in ) could suffice . This amount resembled approximately 1 kilogram ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) of uranium @-@ 235 . These results led to the Frisch – Peierls memorandum , which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms program in Britain . This marked the beginning of an aggressive approach towards uranium enrichment and the development of an atomic bomb . They now began to investigate processes by which they could successfully separate the uranium isotope . 
 Their results were discussed with Oliphant , Tizard and Thomson . These men set up a government committee , the MAUD Committee , which in time became Britain 's Tube Alloy program . The committee ’ s purpose was to examine the potential of Frisch and Peierls ' quantitative and qualitative analysis regarding critical mass and uranium separation . After investigation the committee endorsed the Frisch and Peierls memorandum . The conclusion of their report was that a super weapon was both possible and feasible . 
 = = MAUD Committee = = 
 The MAUD Committee was founded in June 1940 . The Committee was originally a part of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare , but later gained independence with the Ministry of Aircraft Production . The committee was initially named after its chairman , Thomson , but quickly exchanged this for a more unassuming name , the MAUD Committee . MAUD is assumed by many to be an acronym , but it was not . The name MAUD came to be in an unusual way . Shortly after Germany invaded Denmark , Bohr had sent a telegram to Frisch . The telegram ended with a strange line : " Tell Cockcroft and Maud Ray Kent " . At first it was thought to be code regarding radium or other vital atomic @-@ weapons @-@ related information , hidden in an anagram . One suggestion was to replace the y with an i , producing ' radium taken ' . Regardless of how crazy it seemed it was enough to cause concern in Britain . When Bohr returned to England in 1943 , it was discovered that the message was addressed to Bohr 's housekeeper Maud Ray and Cockcroft . Maud Ray was from Kent . Thus the committee was named The <unk> Committee . Meetings were normally held in the offices of the Royal Society in London . In addition to Thomson , its original members were Chadwick , Cockcroft , Oliphant and Philip Moon . Patrick Blackett , Charles Ellis and William Haworth . 
 Four universities provided the locations where the experiments were taking place . The laboratory at the University of Birmingham was responsible for all the theoretical work , such as what size of critical mass was needed for an explosion . It was run by Peierls , with the help of fellow German refugee scientist Klaus Fuchs . The laboratories at the University of Liverpool and the University of Oxford experimented with different types of isotope separation . Chadwick 's group at Liverpool dealt with thermal diffusion , which worked based on the assumption that different isotopes of uranium are attracted to different temperatures . Franz Simon 's group at Oxford investigated the gaseous diffusion of isotopes . This method works on the principle that at differing pressures uranium 235 would diffuse through a barrier faster than uranium 238 . Eventually the most promising method of separation was gaseous diffusion . Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather 's group at Cambridge investigated whether another element , now called plutonium , could be used as an explosive compound . Because of the French scientists , Oxford also obtained the world 's only supply of heavy water , which helped them theorise how uranium could be used for power . 
 The research from the MAUD committee was complied in two reports , commonly known as the MAUD reports in July 1941 . The first report , " Use of Uranium for a Bomb " , discussed the feasibility of creating a super @-@ bomb from uranium , which they now thought to be true . The second , " Use of Uranium as a Source of Power " discussed the idea of using uranium as a source of power , not just a bomb . The MAUD Committee and report helped bring about the British nuclear program , the Tube Alloys Project . Not only did it help start a nuclear project in Britain but it helped jump @-@ start the American project . Without the help of the MAUD Committee the American program , the Manhattan Project , would have started months behind . Instead they were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb , not whether it was possible . Historian Margaret Gowing noted that " events that change a time scale by only a few months can nevertheless change history . " 
 The MAUD reports were reviewed by the Defence Services Panel of the Scientific Advisory Committee . This was chaired by Lord Hankey , with its other members being Sir Edward Appleton , Sir Henry Dale , Alfred Egerton , Archibald Hill and Edward Mellanby . The panel held seven meetings in September 1941 , and submitted its report to the Lord President of the Council , Sir John Anderson . At this point it was feared that German scientists were attempting to provide their country with an atomic bomb , and thus Britain needed to finish its first . The report ultimately stated that if there were even a sliver of a chance that the bomb effort could produce a weapon with such power , then every effort should be made to make sure Britain did not fall behind . While it recommended that while a pilot separation plant be built in Britain , the production facility should be built in Canada . The Defence Services Panel submitted its report on 24 September 1941 , but by this time the final decision had already been taken . Lord Cherwell had taken the matter to the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , who became the first national leader to approve a nuclear weapons program on 30 August 1941 . The Chiefs of Staff Committee supported the decision . 
 = = Tube Alloys organisation = = 
 A directorate of Tube Alloys was established as part of Appleton 's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research , and Wallace Akers , the research director of Imperial Chemical Industries ( ICI ) , was chosen as its head . Anderson and Akers came up with the name Tube Alloys . It was deliberately chosen to be meaningless , " with a specious air of probability about it " . An advisory committee known as the Tube Alloys Consultative Council was created to oversee its work , chaired by Anderson , with its other members being Lord Hankey , Lord Cherwell , Sir Edward Appleton and Sir Henry Dale . This handled policy matters . To deal with technical issues , a Technical Committee was created with Akers as chairman , and Chadwick , Simon , Halban , Peierls , and Roland Slade from ICI as its original members , with Michael Perrin as its secretary . It was later joined by Charles Galton Darwin , Cockcroft , Oliphant and Feather . 
 = = Isotopic separation = = 
 The biggest problem faced by the MAUD Committee was to find a way to separate the 0 @.@ 7 % of uranium @-@ 235 from the 99 @.@ 3 % of uranium @-@ 238 . This is difficult because the two types of uranium are chemically identical . Separation ( uranium enrichment ) would have to be achieved at a large scale . At Cambridge , Eric <unk> and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge . Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method . Frisch ’ s calculations showed there would need to be 100 @,@ 000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount . Simon proceeded in a different direction , Peierls turned to Franz Simon , a chemist shielded in Britain , to consult methods of isotope separation . Simon preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production . 
 When Moon examined the suggestion that gaseous thermal diffusion be the method of choice to the MAUD committee , there was no majority agreement upon to move forward with it . The committee consulted with Peierls and Simon over the separation method and came to the agreement that “ ordinary ” gaseous diffusion was the best method to pursue . This relies on Graham 's Law , the fact that the gases diffuse through porous materials at rates that are determined by their molecular weight . Francis Ashton applied this method in 1913 when he separated two isotopes of neon by diffusing a sample thousands of times through a pipe clay . Thick materials like pipe clay proved too slow to be efficient on an industry scale . Simon proposed using a metal foil punctured with millions of microscopic holes would allow the separation process to move faster . He estimated that a plant that separated 1 kilogram ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) per diem of uranium @-@ 235 from natural uranium would cost about £ 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . The MAUD Committee realised that an atomic bomb was not just feasible , but inevitable . 
 In 1941 , Frisch moved to London to work with Chadwick and his cyclotron . Frisch built a Clusius tube there to study the properties of uranium hexafluoride . Frisch and Chadwick discovered that it is of one the gases for which the Clusius method will not work . This was only a minor setback due to the fact that Simon was already in progress of establishing the alternative method of separation through ordinary gaseous diffusion . 
 The chemical problems of producing gaseous compounds of uranium and pure uranium metal were studied at the University of Birmingham and by ICI . Very early experiments were carried out by Michael Clapham , who at the time was working on print technology at the Kynoch Works in Aston in Birmingham Philip Baxter at ICI made the first small batch of gaseous uranium hexafluoride for Chadwick in 1940 . ICI received a formal £ 5 @,@ 000 contract in December 1940 to make 3 kilograms ( 6 @.@ 6 lb ) of this vital material for the future work . The prototype gaseous diffusion equipment itself was manufactured by Metropolitan @-@ Vickers ( <unk> ) at Trafford Park , Manchester , at a cost of £ 150 @,@ 000 for four units . ICI pilot plants for producing 1 long hundredweight ( 51 kg ) of pure uranium metal and 50 to 100 kilograms ( 110 to 220 lb ) of uranium hexafluoride per diem commenced operation in Widnes in mid @-@ 1943 . 
 = = Plutonium = = 
 The breakthrough with plutonium was by Bretscher and Norman Feather at the Cavendish Laboratory . They realised that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium @-@ 239 as a by @-@ product . This is because uranium @-@ 238 absorbs slow neutrons and forms a short @-@ lived new isotope , uranium @-@ 239 . The new isotope 's nucleus rapidly emits an electron through beta decay producing a new element with an atomic mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93 . This element 's nucleus then also emits an electron and becomes a new element with an atomic number 94 and a much greater half @-@ life . Bretscher and Feather showed theoretically feasible grounds that element 94 would be fissile — readily fissioned by both slow and fast neutrons , with the added advantage of being different from uranium , and therefore could be chemically separated from it . Bretscher even devised a chemical method to separate . 
 This new development was also confirmed in independent work by Edwin M. McMillan and Philip Abelson at Berkeley Radiation Laboratory also in 1940 . Nicholas <unk> of the Cambridge team proposed the names neptunium for the new element 93 and plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus ( uranium being element 92 ) . The Americans fortuitously suggested the same names . The production and identification of the first sample of plutonium in 1941 is generally credited to Glenn Seaborg , using a cyclotron rather than a reactor at the University of California . In 1941 , neither team knew of the existence of the other . 
 Chadwick voiced concerns about the need for such pure plutonium to make a feasible bomb . He also suspected that the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to proposed premature detonations . After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943 , he learned of a proposed bomb design which they were calling an implosion . The sub @-@ critical mass of plutonium was supposed to be surrounded by explosives that were arranged to detonate simultaneously . This would cause the Plutonium core to be compressed and become supercritical . The core would be surrounded by a depleted uranium tamper which would reflect the neutrons back into the reaction , and contribute to the explosion by fissioning itself . This design solved Chadwick 's worries about purity because it did not require the level that would be needed for the gun @-@ type fission weapon . The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses . Chadwick took this info with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England . 
 = = Montreal Laboratory = = 
 Halban 's heavy water team from France continued its slow neutron research at Cambridge University ; but the project was given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making . It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium . The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America , in proximity to the raw materials it required , and where the American research was being done . But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its own identity , and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water , that team might not receive a fair share of resources . The Americans had their own concerns , particularly about security , since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British . They also had concerns about patent rights ; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre @-@ war work . As a compromise , Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada . 
 The Canadian government was approached , and Dean Mackenzie , the president of the National Research Council of Canada , immediately welcomed and supported the proposal . The costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments , but the British share would come from a billion dollar war gift from Canada . The first eight staff arrived in Montreal at the end of 1942 , and occupied a house belonging to McGill University . Three months later they moved into a 200 square metres ( 2 @,@ 200 sq ft ) area in a new building at the University of Montreal . The laboratory grew quickly to over 300 staff ; about half were Canadians recruited by George Laurence . A subgroup of theoreticians was recruited and headed by a Czechoslovak physicist , George Placzek . Placzek proved to be a very capable group leader , and was generally regarded as the only member of the staff with the stature of the highest scientific rank and with close personal contacts with many key physicists involved in the Manhattan project . Friedrich Paneth became head of the chemistry division , and Pierre Auger of the experimental physics division . Von Halban was the director of the laboratory , but he proved to be an unfortunate choice as he was a poor administrator , and did not work well with the National Research Council of Canada . The Americans saw him as a security risk , and objected to the French atomic patents claimed by the Paris Group ( in association with ICI ) . 
 The Montreal team in Canada depended on the Americans for supplies of heavy water from the US heavy water plant in Trail , British Columbia , ( which was under American contract ) , as well as technical information about plutonium . The Americans said that they would give heavy water to the Montreal group only if it agreed to direct its research along the limited lines suggested by du Pont . Despite doing much good work , by June 1943 work at the Montreal Lab had come to a complete standstill . Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project . In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting in Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor . John Cockcroft became the director . The Americans supported the project with information and visits . They also supplied material , for example , uranium and heavy water . The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944 , and in 1946 the Montreal Laboratory was closed . The project developed the ZEEP reactor , which went critical in September 1945 . 
 = = Niels Bohr 's contribution to Tube Alloys = = 
 Sir John Anderson was eager to invite Niels Bohr to the Tube Alloys project because he was a world @-@ famous scientist who would not only contribute his expertise to the project , but also help the British government gain leverage in dealings with the Manhattan Project . In September 1943 , word reached Bohr in Denmark that the Nazis considered his family to be Jewish , and that they were in danger of being arrested . The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September 1943 . When the news of Bohr 's escape reached Britain , Lord Cherwell sent a telegram asking Bohr to come to Britain . Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation ( BOAC ) . 
 At the invitation of the director of the Manhattan Project , Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves , Jr , Bohr visited the Manhattan Project sites in November 1943 . Groves offered Bohr substantial pay , but Bohr initially refused the offer because he wanted to make sure that the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real cooperative partnership . In December 1943 , after a meeting with Albert Einstein , Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the Manhattan Project . 
 Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort . He also attempted to prevent an atomic arms race with the Soviet Union after the war , which he believed to be a serious threat . In 1944 , Bohr made several key points he believed to be essential towards international nuclear weapon control . He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project in order to decrease the likelihood of it feeling threatened on the premise that the other nations were building a bomb behind their back . His beliefs stemmed from the fact that he was convinced the Russians already knew about the Manhattan Project , which therefore led him to believe that there was no point in hiding it from them . 
 Bohr 's evidence came from an interpretation of a letter he received from a Soviet friend and scientist in Russia , which he showed to the British security services . He reasoned that the longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advancements , Russia would feel increasingly threatened and more inclined to speed up their effort to produce an atomic bomb of their own . With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter , Bohr met with the President of the United States , Franklin D. Roosevelt , who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons on 26 August 1944 ; but Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work . At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944 , Roosevelt sided with Churchill , deciding that it would be upon the nation 's best interest to keep the atomic bomb project a secret . Moreover , they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and specific security measures must be made in order to prevent him from leaking information to the rest of the world , Russia in particular .

 In 1940 , a British mission , led by Tizard and with members that included Cockcroft , was sent to America to create relations and help advance the research towards war technology with the Americans . The most important device transferred through the Tizard Mission was the cavity magnetron . This inquiry from the Tizard Mission made it possible for the Americans to create a radiation laboratory . This lab would later be used as a model for the Los Alamos laboratory . Tizard Mission members were involved in advising scientists on construction of the lab and its relations with the armed forces . A barrier had been broken and a pathway to exchange technical information between the two countries had been developed . The mission did not discuss the development of nuclear fission because at the time the process of fission was deemed impractical and was not a main priority for Tizard Mission members . 
 = = = Oliphant 's visit to the United States = = = 
 The MAUD Committee reports urged the cooperation with the United States should be continued in the research of nuclear fission . Charles C. Lauritsen , a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee ( NDRC ) , was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting . The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous @-@ diffusion as their isotope separation device . Once he returned to the United States , he was able to brief Vannevar Bush , the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) , concerning the details discussed during the meeting . 
 In August 1941 , Mark Oliphant , Director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and original member of the MAUD Committee , was sent to the United States to assist the NDRC on radar . Upon his visit to the U.S. , Oliphant met with William D. Coolidge . Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium @-@ 235 would be efficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons . While in America , Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S @-@ 1 Uranium Committee , Lyman Briggs , had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S @-@ 1 Committee members of all its findings . 
 Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed . Oliphant also travelled to Berkley to with meet with Ernest Lawrence , inventor of the cyclotron . After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium , Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant , George B. Pegram , and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence . Oliphant was not only able to get in touch with Lawrence , but he met with Conant and Bush to inform them of the significant data the MAUD had discovered . Oliphant ’ s ability to inform the Americans led to Oliphant convincing Lawrence , Lawrence convincing Compton , and then Kistiakowsky convincing Conant to move forward with nuclear weapons . These actions from Oliphant resulted in Bush taking this report directly to the president . 
 = = = Information sharing ceases = = = 
 The American effort increased rapidly and soon outstripped the British as the American authorities were reluctant to share details with their British counterparts . However , separate research continued in each country with some exchange of information . Several of the key British scientists visited the United States early in 1942 and were given full access to all of the information available . They were astounded at the momentum that the American atomic bomb project had then assumed . The British and American exchange of information and efforts continued but the nations did not combine their efforts , leading their programmes separately . Furthermore , in 1941 the British Government rebuffed and vetoed attempts and proposals by Bush and Conant to strengthen cooperation between Great Britain and America . 
 In June 1942 , the United States Army Corps of Engineers took over the Manhattan Project from OSRD , and Groves became the project 's director . He tightened security , which dried up the flow of information to Britain . American officials were particularly concerned that Akers and other people from ICI involved in the Tube Alloys project were trying to exploit American nuclear scientific knowledge to create a profitable post @-@ war industry . In October 1942 , Bush and Conant convinced Roosevelt that the United States should independently develop the atomic bomb project , despite an agreement of unrestricted scientific interchange between United States and Britain . 
 This had a disastrous impact on British efforts as they lacked manpower , facilities , equipment and materials . Tube Alloys therefore fell behind in the race with the Manhattan Project . On 30 July 1942 , Anderson advised Churchill that : " We must face the fact that ... [ our ] pioneering work ... is a dwindling asset and that , unless we capitalise it quickly , we shall be outstripped . We now have a real contribution to make to a ' merger . ' Soon we shall have little or none " By the time Great Britain realised it , the position had worsened ; Bush decided that outside help for the Manhattan Project was no longer needed . The Military Policy Committee ( MPC ) supported Bush 's arguments and restricted access to the classified information which Britain could utilise to develop its atomic weapons programme , even if it slowed down the American efforts . 
 The Americans stopped sharing any information on heavy water production , the manufacture of uranium hexafluoride , the method of electromagnetic separation , the physical or chemical properties of plutonium , the details of bomb design , or the facts about fast neutron reactions . This was a major disappointment which hindered the British and the Canadians , who were collaborating on heavy water production and several other aspects of the research programme . By 1943 Britain had stopped sending its scientists to the United States , which slowed down the pace of work being done there . The British boycott had an impact on the American project , which had relied on efforts led by British scientists . In March 1943 Conant approached the Military Policy Committee , which decided that Britain 's help would benefit some areas of the project . Chadwick , Penney , Peierls , Oliphant and other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at the Los Alamos Laboratory needed them , despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets .

 Churchill then sought information about building Britain 's own gaseous diffusion plant , a heavy water plant and an atomic reactor in Britain , despite its immense cost . However , in July 1943 , in London , American officials cleared up some major misunderstandings about British motives , and after many months of negotiations the Quebec Agreement was signed by Churchill and Roosevelt on 19 August 1943 during the Quebec Conference . The British handed over their material to the Americans and in return received the copies of the American progress reports to the President . Tube Alloys was subsumed into the Manhattan Project . 
 In a section of the Quebec Agreement formally entitled " Articles of Agreement governing collaboration between the authorities of the USA and UK in the matter of Tube Alloys " , Britain and the USA agreed to share resources " to bring the Tube Alloys [ i.e. the Atomic Bomb ] project to fruition at the earliest moment . " The leaders further agreed that : 
 " First , we will never use this agency against each other , 
 " Secondly , we will not use it against third parties without each other 's consent , and 
 " Thirdly , we will not either of us communicate any information about Tube Alloys to third parties except by mutual consent . " 
 It was also agreed that any post @-@ war advantages of an industrial or commercial nature would be decided at the discretion of the President . The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee to control the Manhattan Project , consisting of Henry Stimson , Bush and Conant from the United States ; Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin were the British members , and C. D. Howe was the Canadian member . Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir Ronald Ian Campbell , who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States , Lord Halifax , in early 1945 . Dill died in Washington , D.C. , in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission and as a member of the Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson . 
 = = British contribution to the Manhattan Project = = 
 Akers summoned Chadwick , Oliphant , Simon and Peierls to the United States . They arrived the day the Quebec Agreement was signed , ready to assist the Manhattan Project in any way possible . Akers was generally disliked and the Americans refused to move forward with collaboration unless a top British scientist who was " accepted and sound of judgement " was appointed instead . British officials dug in over Britain 's right to make its own appointments to its own government agencies . A compromise was reached , with Chadwick put in charge as Britain 's technical advisor for the Combined Policy Committee , and as the head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project . 
 With this dispute settled collaboration could once again take place . Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists as possible so long as Groves accepted them . Chadwick 's first choice , Joseph Rotblat refused to give up his Polish citizenship . Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch , who to Chadwick 's surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the screening process so that he could travel to America . Chadwick spent the first few weeks of November 1943 acquiring a clear picture of the extensive Manhattan Project . He realized the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge , Tennessee , which was the new headquarters of the project , and could safely conclude that without similar industrial site being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low . 
 With Chadwick involved the main goal was to show that the Quebec Agreement was a success . It was Britain 's duty to cooperate to the fullest and speed along the process . Chadwick used this opportunity to give as many young British scientists experience as possible so that they might carry that experience to post @-@ war Britain . He eventually convinced Groves of Rotblat 's integrity to the cause , and this led to Rotblat being accepted to the Manhattan Project without renouncing his nationality . Rotblat had been left in charge of the Tube Alloys research , and brought with him the results obtained since Chadwick had left . 
 William Penney , one of the Tube Alloys scientists , was an expert in shock waves . In June 1944 he went to America to work at the Los Alamos Laboratory as part of the British delegation . He worked on means to assess the effects of a nuclear explosion , and wrote a paper on what height the bombs should be detonated at for maximum effect in attacks on Germany and Japan . He served as a member of the target committee established by Groves to select Japanese cities for atomic bombing , and on Tinian with Project Alberta as a special consultant . Along with Group Captain Leonard Cheshire , sent as a British representative , he watched the bombing of Nagasaki from the observation plane Big Stink . He also formed part of the Manhattan Project 's post @-@ war scientific mission to Hiroshima and Nagasaki that assessed the extent of the damage caused by the bombs . 
 The Smyth Report was issued by the US War Department on 12 August 1945 , giving the story of the atomic bomb and including the technical details that could now be made public . It made few references to the British contribution to the bomb , and a White Paper , Statements Relating to the Atomic Bomb was hurriedly drafted by Michael Perrin . This account was issued just after Attlee had replaced Churchill as Prime Minister , and was the only official statement on the British contribution for fifteen years .

 The Soviet Union received details of British research from its atomic spies Klaus Fuchs , Engelbert Broda , Melita Norwood and John Cairncross , a member of the notorious Cambridge Five . Alan Nunn May was recruited later in Canada . Lavrenty Beria 's report to Stalin of March 1942 included the MAUD reports and other British documents passed by Cairncross . Fuchs began disclosing information to the Soviet Union about the possible production of a British atomic bomb when he joined the Tube Alloys project , although his contribution towards Soviet espionage was more severe during the Manhattan Project . Fuchs was able to contact a London @-@ based KPD leader , Jürgen Kuczynski and his courier Ursula <unk> .

 The Atomic Energy Research Establishment ( <unk> or the Harwell Laboratory ) near Harwell , Oxfordshire , was established by Cockcroft in 1946 as the main centre for military and civilian atomic energy research and development in Britain . Former Royal Air Force stations were selected for <unk> and AWRE as they were isolated , with large hangars . Penney returned from the United States and was appointed to a professorship ( for Mathematics ) at Imperial College . He accepted the directorship position at the Armament Research Department ( ARD ) in 1946 . 
 With the end of the war the The Special Relationship between Britain and the United States " became very much less special " . The British government had trusted that America would share nuclear technology , which the British saw as a joint discovery . On 9 November 1945 , Mackenzie King and the British Prime Minister , Clement Attlee went to Washington , D.C. , to confer with President Harry Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power . The three leaders agreed that there would be full and effective cooperation on atomic energy , but British hopes for a full resumption of cooperation on nuclear weapons were disappointed . The Americans soon made it clear that this was restricted to basic scientific research . 
 The passing of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 ( McMahon Act ) in August 1946 , made it clear that the UK would no longer be allowed access to the United States ' atomic research . This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946 . On 8 January 1947 , Prime Minister Clement Attlee formed a secret " <unk> Cabinet committee " , consisting of six cabinet ministers of his government , which decided that Britain required the atomic bomb to maintain its position in world politics . In the words of Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin , " That won 't do at all ... we 've got to have this ... I don 't mind for myself , but I don 't want any other Foreign Secretary of this country to be talked to or at by a Secretary of State in the United States as I have just had in my discussions with Mr Byrnes . We 've got to have this thing over here whatever it costs ... We 've got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it . " 
 Penney did not have any knowledge of such committee until he was approached by Marshal of the Air Force Lord Portal , to lead the clandestine efforts . The project was code @-@ named High Explosive Research ( or HER ) . In May 1947 , Penney was appointed as the director to lead the programme , based at the Royal Armament Research Development Establishment ( <unk> ) at Fort Halstead and the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich ( AWE ) . In short span of time , Penney assembled a team to initiate the work on atomic weapons , firstly preparing a report on describing the feature , science and idea of the American Fat Man implosion bomb . Penney broke down the development tasks required to replicate it , and identifying outstanding questions that required further research on nuclear weapons . The report entitled , " Plutonium Weapon – General Description " was roughly equivalent in terms of scientific data and reports that were provided to the Soviet nuclear program by Klaus Fuchs . 
 In April 1950 an abandoned Second World War airfield , RAF Aldermaston in Berkshire was selected as the permanent home for Britain 's nuclear weapons programme . This was to become the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment ( AWRE ) . On 3 October 1952 , under the code @-@ name " Operation Hurricane " , the first British nuclear device was successfully detonated off the west coast of Australia in the Monte Bello Islands . The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958 , and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US – UK Mutual Defence Agreement . 
 = Wetting = 
 Wetting is the ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface , resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together . The degree of wetting ( wettability ) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces . Wetting deals with the three phases of materials : gas , liquid , and solid . It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials in the past two decades ( e.g. graphene , carbon nanotube ) . 
 Wetting is important in the bonding or adherence of two materials . Wetting and the surface forces that control wetting are also responsible for other related effects , including capillary effects . 
 There are two types of wetting : non @-@ reactive wetting and active wetting . 
 = = Explanation = = 
 <unk> forces between a liquid and solid cause a liquid drop to spread across the surface . Cohesive forces within the liquid cause the drop to ball up and avoid contact with the surface . 
 The contact angle ( θ ) , as seen in Figure 1 , is the angle at which the liquid – vapor interface meets the solid – liquid interface . The contact angle is determined by the result between adhesive and cohesive forces . As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat , solid surface increases , the contact angle decreases . Thus , the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability . 
 A contact angle less than 90 ° ( low contact angle ) usually indicates that wetting of the surface is very favorable , and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface . Contact angles greater than 90 ° ( high contact angle ) generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable , so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet . 
 For water , a wettable surface may also be termed hydrophilic and a <unk> surface hydrophobic . <unk> surfaces have contact angles greater than 150 ° , showing almost no contact between the liquid drop and the surface . This is sometimes referred to as the " Lotus effect " . The table describes varying contact angles and their corresponding solid / liquid and liquid / liquid interactions . For <unk> liquids , the term <unk> is used for low contact angle conditions and <unk> is used when higher contact angles result . Similarly , the terms <unk> and <unk> apply to both polar and <unk> liquids . 
 = = High @-@ energy vs. low @-@ energy surfaces = = 
 Liquids can interact with two main types of solid surfaces . Traditionally , solid surfaces have been divided into high @-@ energy solids and low @-@ energy types . The relative energy of a solid has to do with the bulk nature of the solid itself . Solids such as metals , glasses , and ceramics are known as ' hard solids ' because the chemical bonds that hold them together ( e.g. , covalent , ionic , or metallic ) are very strong . Thus , it takes a large input of energy to break these solids ( alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy ) , so they are termed “ high energy ” . Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high @-@ energy surfaces . 
 The other type of solids is weak molecular crystals ( e.g. , fluorocarbons , hydrocarbons , etc . ) where the molecules are held together essentially by physical forces ( e.g. , van der Waals and hydrogen bonds ) . Since these solids are held together by weak forces , a very low input of energy is required to break them , thus they are termed “ low energy ” . Depending on the type of liquid chosen , low @-@ energy surfaces can permit either complete or partial wetting . 
 Dynamic surfaces have been reported that undergo changes in surface energy upon the application of an appropriate stimuli . For example , a surface presenting photon @-@ driven molecular motors was shown to undergo changes in water contact angle when switched between bistable conformations of differing surface energies . 
 = = = Wetting of low @-@ energy surfaces = = = 
 Low @-@ energy surfaces primarily interact with liquids through dispersion ( van der Waals ) forces . William Zisman had several key findings in the work that he did : 
 Zisman observed that cos θ increases linearly as the surface tension ( γLV ) of the liquid decreased . Thus , he was able to establish a linear function between cos θ and the surface tension ( γLV ) for various organic liquids . 
 A surface is more wettable when γLV and θ is low . Zisman termed the intercept of these lines when cos θ = 1 , as the critical surface tension ( <unk> ) of that surface . This critical surface tension is an important parameter because it is a characteristic of only the solid . 
 Knowing the critical surface tension of a solid , it is possible to predict the wettability of the surface . The wettability of a surface is determined by the outermost chemical groups of the solid . Differences in wettability between surfaces that are similar in structure are due to differences in packing of the atoms . For instance , if a surface has branched chains , it will have poorer packing than a surface with straight chains . 
 = = Ideal solid surfaces = = 
 An ideal surface is flat , rigid , perfectly smooth , and chemically homogeneous , and has zero contact angle hysteresis . Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal . In other words , only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists . When a drop of liquid is placed on such a surface , the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig . 1 . Furthermore , on an ideal surface , the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed . The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces ; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium . 
 = = = Minimization of energy , three phases = = = 
 Figure 3 shows the line of contact where three phases meet . In equilibrium , the net force per unit length acting along the boundary line between the three phases must be zero . The components of net force in the direction along each of the interfaces are given by : 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 where α , β , and θ are the angles shown and <unk> is the surface energy between the two indicated phases . These relations can also be expressed by an analog to a triangle known as Neumann ’ s triangle , shown in Figure 4 . Neumann ’ s triangle is consistent with the geometrical restriction that <formula> , and applying the law of sines and law of cosines to it produce relations that describe how the interfacial angles depend on the ratios of surface energies . 
 Because these three surface energies form the sides of a triangle , they are constrained by the triangle inequalities , <unk> < <unk> + <unk> meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed the sum of the other two . If three fluids with surface energies that do not follow these inequalities are brought into contact , no equilibrium configuration consistent with Figure 3 will exist . 
 = = = = Simplification to planar geometry , Young 's relation = = = = 
 If the β phase is replaced by a flat rigid surface , as shown in Figure 5 , then β = π , and the second net force equation simplifies to the Young equation , 
 <formula> 
 which relates the surface tensions between the three phases : solid , liquid and gas . Subsequently , this predicts the contact angle of a liquid droplet on a solid surface from knowledge of the three surface energies involved . This equation also applies if the " gas " phase is another liquid , immiscible with the droplet of the first " liquid " phase . 
 = = = = Real smooth surfaces and the Young contact angle = = = = 
 The Young equation assumes a perfectly flat and rigid surface often referred to as an ideal surface . In many cases , surfaces are far from this ideal situation , and two are considered here : the case of rough surfaces and the case of smooth surfaces that are still real ( finitely rigid ) . Even in a perfectly smooth surface , a drop will assume a wide spectrum of contact angles ranging from the so @-@ called advancing contact angle , <formula> , to the so @-@ called receding contact angle , <formula> . The equilibrium contact angle ( <formula> ) can be calculated from <formula> and <formula> as was shown by Tadmor as , 
 <formula> 
 where 
 <formula> 
 = = = = The Young – Dupré equation and spreading coefficient = = = = 
 The Young – Dupré equation ( Thomas Young 1805 ; <unk> Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869 ) dictates that neither γSG nor γSL can be larger than the sum of the other two surface energies . The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG . The lack of a solution to the Young – Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180 ° for those situations . 
 A useful parameter for gauging wetting is the spreading parameter S , 
 <formula> 
 When S > 0 , the liquid wets the surface completely ( complete wetting ) . When S < 0 , partial wetting occurs . 
 Combining the spreading parameter definition with the Young relation yields the Young – Dupré equation : 
 <formula> 
 which only has physical solutions for θ when S < 0 . 
 = = <unk> rough solid surfaces = = 
 Unlike ideal surfaces , real surfaces do not have perfect smoothness , rigidity , or chemical homogeneity . Such deviations from ideality result in phenomenon called contact @-@ angle hysteresis , which is defined as the difference between the advancing ( <unk> ) and receding ( <unk> ) contact angles 
 <formula> 
 In simpler terms , contact angle hysteresis is essentially the displacement of a contact line such as the one in Figure 3 , by either expansion or retraction of the droplet . Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles . The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle , whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle . Contact @-@ angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid . These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states . 
 Such motion of a phase boundary , involving advancing and receding contact angles , is known as dynamic wetting . When a contact line advances , covering more of the surface with liquid , the contact angle is increased and generally is related to the velocity of the contact line . If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound , the contact angle increases , and as it approaches 180 ° , the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid . This is a kinetic <unk> effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur . 
 A well @-@ known departure from ideality is when the surface of interest has a rough texture . The rough texture of a surface can fall into one of two categories : homogeneous or heterogeneous . A homogeneous wetting regime is where the liquid fills in the roughness grooves of a surface . A heterogeneous wetting regime , though , is where the surface is a composite of two types of patches . An important example of such a composite surface is one composed of patches of both air and solid . Such surfaces have varied effects on the contact angles of wetting liquids . Cassie – Baxter and Wenzel are the two main models that attempt to describe the wetting of textured surfaces . However , these equations only apply when the drop size is sufficiently large compared with the surface roughness scale . When the droplet size is comparable to that of the underlying pillars , the effect of line tension should be considered . . 
 = = = Wenzel 's model = = = 
 The Wenzel model ( Robert N. Wenzel 1936 ) describes the homogeneous wetting regime , as seen in Figure 7 , and is defined by the following equation for the contact angle on a rough surface : 
 <formula> 
 where <formula> is the apparent contact angle which corresponds to the stable equilibrium state ( i.e. minimum free energy state for the system ) . The roughness ratio , r , is a measure of how surface roughness affects a homogeneous surface . The roughness ratio is defined as the ratio of true area of the solid surface to the apparent area . 
 θ is the Young contact angle as defined for an ideal surface . Although Wenzel 's equation demonstrates the contact angle of a rough surface is different from the intrinsic contact angle , it does not describe contact angle hysteresis . 
 = = = Cassie – Baxter model = = = 
 When dealing with a heterogeneous surface , the Wenzel model is not sufficient . A more complex model is needed to measure how the apparent contact angle changes when various materials are involved . This heterogeneous surface , like that seen in Figure 8 , is explained using the Cassie – Baxter equation ( Cassie 's law ) : 
 <formula> 
 Here the rf is the roughness ratio of the wet surface area and f is the fraction of solid surface area wet by the liquid . It is important to realize that when f 
 = 1 and rf = 
 r , the Cassie – Baxter equations becomes the Wenzel equation . On the other hand , when there are many different fractions of surface roughness , each fraction of the total surface area is denoted by <formula> . 
 A summation of all fi equals 1 or the total surface . Cassie – Baxter can also be recast in the following equation : 
 <formula> 
 Here γ is the Cassie – Baxter surface tension between liquid and vapor , the <unk> , <unk> is the solid vapor surface tension of every component and <unk> , <unk> is the solid liquid surface tension of every component . A case that is worth mentioning is when the liquid drop is placed on the substrate and creates small air pockets underneath it . This case for a two @-@ component system is denoted by : 
 <formula> 
 Here the key difference to notice is that there is no surface tension between the solid and the vapor for the second surface tension component . This is because of the assumption that the surface of air that is exposed is under the droplet and is the only other substrate in the system . Subsequently the equation is then expressed as ( 1 – f ) . Therefore , the Cassie equation can be easily derived from the Cassie – Baxter equation . Experimental results regarding the surface properties of Wenzel versus Cassie – Baxter systems showed the effect of pinning for a Young angle of 180 to 90 ° , a region classified under the Cassie – Baxter model . This liquid / air composite system is largely hydrophobic . After that point , a sharp transition to the Wenzel regime was found where the drop wets the surface , but no further than edges of the drop . 
 = = = = Precursor film = = = = 
 With the advent of high resolution imaging , researchers have started to obtain experimental data which have led them to question the assumptions of the Cassie – Baxter equation when calculating the apparent contact angle . These groups believe the apparent contact angle is largely dependent on the triple line . The triple line , which is in contact with the heterogeneous surface , cannot rest on the heterogeneous surface like the rest of the drop . In theory , it should follow the surface imperfection . This bending in triple line is unfavorable and is not seen in real @-@ world situations . A theory that preserves the Cassie – Baxter equation while at the same time explaining the presence of minimized energy state of the triple line hinges on the idea of a precursor film . This film of <unk> thickness advances ahead of the motion of the droplet and is found around the triple line . Furthermore , this precursor film allows the triple line to bend and take different conformations that were originally considered unfavorable . This precursor fluid has been observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy ( <unk> ) in surfaces with pores formed in the bulk . With the introduction of the precursor film concept , the triple line can follow energetically feasible conformations and thereby correctly explaining the Cassie – Baxter model . 
 = = = = " Petal effect " vs. " lotus effect " = = = = 
 The intrinsic hydrophobicity of a surface can be enhanced by being textured with different length scales of roughness . The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for <unk> . More specifically , each rose petal has a collection of <unk> on the surface and each papilla , in turn , has many <unk> . The term “ petal effect ” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape , but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down . The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the <unk> of the petal ( contact angle of about 152 @.@ 4 ° ) , but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water . 
 When comparing the " petal effect " to the " lotus effect " , it is important to note some striking differences . The surface structure of the lotus leaf and the rose petal , as seen in Figure 9 , can be used to explain the two different effects . The lotus petal has a randomly rough surface and low contact angle hysteresis , which means the water droplet is not able to wet the microstructure spaces between the spikes . This allows air to remain inside the texture , causing a heterogeneous surface composed of both air and solid . As a result , the adhesive force between the water and the solid surface is extremely low , allowing the water to roll off easily ( i.e. " self @-@ cleaning " phenomenon ) . 
 However , the rose petal 's micro- and nanostructures are larger in scale than those of the lotus leaf , which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture . However , as seen in Figure 9 , the liquid can enter the larger @-@ scale grooves , but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves . This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime . Since the liquid can wet the larger @-@ scale grooves , the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high . This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down . However , this effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed . 
 = = = Cassie – Baxter to Wenzel transition = = = 
 In the Cassie – Baxter model , the drop sits on top of the textured surface with trapped air underneath . During the wetting transition from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state , the air pockets are no longer thermodynamically stable and liquid begins to nucleate from the middle of the drop , creating a “ mushroom state ” as seen in Figure 10 . The penetration condition is given by : 
 <formula> 
 where 
 <unk> is the critical contact angle 
 Φ is the fraction of solid / liquid interface where drop is in contact with surface 
 r is solid roughness ( for flat surface , r = 1 ) 
 The penetration front propagates to minimize the surface energy until it reaches the edges of the drop , thus arriving at the Wenzel state . Since the solid can be considered an absorptive material due to its surface roughness , this phenomenon of spreading and imbibition is called <unk> . The contact angles at which spreading / imbibition occurs are between 0 and π / 2 . 
 The Wenzel model is valid between <unk> and π / 2 . If the contact angle is less than <unk> , the penetration front spreads beyond the drop and a liquid film forms over the surface . Figure 11 depicts the transition from the Wenzel state to the surface film state . The film smoothes the surface roughness and the Wenzel model no longer applies . In this state , the equilibrium condition and Young 's relation yields : 
 <formula> 
 By fine @-@ tuning the surface roughness , it is possible to achieve a transition between both <unk> and <unk> regions . Generally , the rougher the surface , the more hydrophobic it is . 
 = = Spreading dynamics = = 
 If a drop is placed on a smooth , horizontal surface , it is generally not in the equilibrium state . Hence , it spreads until an equilibrium contact radius is reached ( partial wetting ) . While taking into account capillary , gravitational , and viscous contributions , the drop radius as a function of time can be expressed as 
 <formula> 
 For the complete wetting situation , the drop radius at any time during the spreading process is given by

 = = Effect of surfactants on wetting = = 
 Many technological processes require control of liquid spreading over solid surfaces . When a drop is placed on a surface , it can completely wet , partially wet , or not wet the surface . By reducing the surface tension with surfactants , a <unk> material can be made to become partially or completely wetting . The excess free energy ( σ ) of a drop on a solid surface is : 
 <formula> 
 γ is the liquid – vapor interfacial tension 
 γSL is the solid – liquid interfacial tension 
 <unk> is the solid – vapor interfacial tension 
 S is the area of liquid – vapor interface 
 P is the excess pressure inside liquid 
 R is the radius of droplet base 
 Based on this equation , the excess free energy is minimized when γ decreases , γSL decreases , or <unk> increases . Surfactants are absorbed onto the liquid – vapor , solid – liquid , and solid – vapor interfaces , which modify the wetting behavior of hydrophobic materials to reduce the free energy . When surfactants are absorbed onto a hydrophobic surface , the polar head groups face into the solution with the tail pointing outward . In more hydrophobic surfaces , surfactants may form a bilayer on the solid , causing it to become more hydrophilic . The dynamic drop radius can be characterized as the drop begins to spread . Thus , the contact angle changes based on the following equation : 
 <formula> 
 θ0 is initial contact angle 
 θ ∞ is final contact angle 
 τ is the surfactant transfer time scale 
 As the surfactants are absorbed , the solid – vapor surface tension increases and the edges of the drop become hydrophilic . As a result , the drop spreads .

This was in reference to a guitar riff in the song which vocalist Robert Flynn felt had " a Godfather type vibe " . The song was shelved , although the riff resurfaced in a b @-@ side . " Slanderous " was the first song finished that was in the final track listing . By February 2005 , Machine Head had penned rough versions of " Beautiful Mourning " and " Aesthetics of Hate " . 
 = = Recording = = 
 A November 2005 demo contained thirteen songs , which included rough versions of " Aesthetics of Hate " and " Halo " . " Aesthetics of Hate " contained what Flynn described as a " totally fucking lame " Angel of Death " rip off . I hated it every time we played it so I was glad to see that part go ! " In mid August 2006 , Machine Head announced that the title of their sixth studio effort would be The Blackening . Flynn and drummer Dave McClain spent August 18 and 19 jamming together , fine tuning songs chosen for the album and performing pre @-@ production . Phil Demmel resumed lead guitar duties and Adam Duce returned as bassist . 
 Machine Head entered Sharkbite Studios in Oakland , California on August 21 to begin recording The Blackening , with Flynn assuming production duties for the second time . From twenty six written songs , the selection was whittled down to eight . McClain completed the drum tracks to six of the eight tracks on August 25 , followed by the remaining two the next day . Tracking concluded on November 16 , 2006 . 
 The band was surprised at the length of " A Farewell to Arms " and " Clenching the Fists of Dissent " running over ten minutes , and wondered if their fans would " be able to get their heads around " what the band was doing . Record company Roadrunner Records hesitated the band 's decision to open the album with a ten and a half minute song ( " Clenching the Fists of Dissent " ) , and asked the band questions similar to " Are you sure you don ’ t want to get into something a little more direct ? " The band disregarded the comment and believed the song set the tone musically for the remainder of the album . 
 Flynn said " Clenching the Fists of Dissent " and " Wolves " were the most difficult songs to construct . For " Clenching " , he attributed the difficulty to the amount of tracks ; the introduction of the song has 90 , including multiple three @-@ part harmony with two guitars , 20 tracks of snare drum , four tracks of kick drum , and military marching cymbals . The song continues with five electric guitars , three acoustic guitars and two bass guitars . Flynn also described the song " Wolves " as difficult because " it 's all got to be super tight ; there were so many riffs that had to be just locked on down picking " . Mark Keaton provided audio engineering , and Colin Richardson mixed the record in London . 
 Flynn believes the band was naive about the length of songs , and was unconcerned if they would be suitable for radio or MTV , as the band purposely did not want to receive airplay . " Now I Lay Thee Down " has a chorus Flynn describes as " poppy " and added " fucked up lyrics " about one person killing another , and then committing suicide . This was to make the song not suitable for airplay as the band wanted to make a " dark epic record " . 
 = = Lyrical themes = = 
 Lyrical themes explored on The Blackening include love , war , organized religion , anger in society and Machine Head 's " winner take all " spirit . The album 's first single , " Aesthetics of Hate " , is a retaliation that captures the band 's anger towards an article written by William Grim for the conservative web site Iconoclast . Titled " Aesthetics of Hate : R.I.P. Dimebag Abbott , & Good Riddance " , the article praised the murder of Dimebag Darrell by Nathan Gale , while Darrell was performing with Damageplan on December 8 , 2004 . Grim wrote Darrell was " an ignorant , barbaric , untalented possessor of a guitar " who looks " more simian than human " and is " part of a generation that has confused sputum with art and involuntary reflex actions with emotion " . After reading the article , Flynn was furious and wrote the song to send a message to Grim implying " fuck you " , and pay tribute to Dimebag . He created a post on the band 's message board soon after the event describing his friendship with Dimebag . 
 " What would YOU know about love or values ? What would YOU know about giving to the world ? All that you know is teaching prejudice , and your heart is as black as the ' ignorant , filthy , and hideously ugly , heavy metal fans ' you try and paint in your twisted , fictitious ramblings . It 's because of people like YOU , that there are Nathan Gale 's in this world , NOT the <unk> and metal musicians who work to unite people through music " . 
 The songs " Clenching the Fists of Dissent " , " A Farewell to Arms " ( probably a reference to Ernest Hemingway 's novel of the same title A Farewell to Arms , which is set during the first World War ) , and " Halo " deal with politics , the war in Iraq and organized religion , respectively . The band wrote the lyrics about the Iraq war after conducting research and found that " a lot of stuff does not add up " , according to Flynn , which angered the band . Machine Head 's debut album , Burn My Eyes , featured a similar song titled " A Thousand Lies " which dealt with the Gulf War . " Slanderous " deals with hate that still exists throughout society and " Wolves " addresses the band 's competitive " winner takes all " spirit . " Now I Lay Thee Down " features a Romeo and Juliet @-@ esque love story about one person killing another person , and then killing themself . The song relates to the William Shakespeare play , Romeo & Juliet , where at the end of the story , two lovers kill themselves because they assume that their lover is dead . The original lyrics to the chorus of the song were considered " poppy " by Flynn and his band @-@ mates so they intentionally changed them into the lyrics they are now so they wouldn 't get radio play .

 The Blackening received critical acclaim . Blabbermouth.net reviewer Don Kaye awarded the album an almost perfect score of 9 @.@ 5 out of 10 , saying : " one of the purest , finest , most powerful expressions of modern heavy metal released " . Kaye praised the guitar work of Flynn and Demmel on the tracks " Beautiful Mourning " and " Aesthetics of Hate " , and thought the band members surpassed their musical ability in an " intense and dynamic way " . 
 Thom Jurek of Allmusic described the album as " an over the top rage and <unk> with all the qualities that earned the group its enormous fan base by touring and recording " and that the thrash metal element " rivals Slayer at their best " . Rock Sound magazine reviewer Eleanor Goodman awarded the album 9 out of 10 , praising the first two minutes of the opening song , " Clenching the Fists of Dissent " , as " a full @-@ on old @-@ skool thrash attack " . 
 " Aesthetics of Hate " received a Grammy Award nomination for " Best Metal Performance " at the 50th Grammy Awards , which took place on February 12 , 2008 . Though heavily favored , they controversially lost to eventual winners Slayer who had won the previous year for the same album . Other nominees in the category were King Diamond , Shadows Fall , and As I Lay Dying . At the fifth annual Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards and at the Kerrang ! Awards in 2007 , The Blackening won best album over albums by Slayer and Lamb of God . 
 Three years after the release of The Blackening , Machine Head wrapped their touring cycle for the album , finishing in Sydney , Australia on 28 March . In February 2010 , The Blackening was awarded the Album of the Decade award from Metal Hammer . On October 8 , 2011 , the album was voted Roadrunner Records " Album of the Century " in a poll . 
 = = Chart performance = = 
 The Blackening was leaked on to the Internet two weeks before its release by an American journalist who received an advanced copy . Demmel thought it unfortunate , but that it created a " pre @-@ buzz " , as did Flynn who thought the buzz was nothing like the band had before ; " There ’ s internet street buzz vs. record company hype and if the hype matches up to the street buzz , then you ’ re seeing a lot of bands selling a lot of records in the first week " . The Blackening became Machine Head 's highest charting release in the United States , where it entered the Top Rock albums at No. 9 , and the Billboard 200 at No. 54 ( their highest charting and first week ever ) , with sales of almost 16 @,@ 000 copies . This improved on the band 's 2004 release , Through the Ashes of Empires , which sold 12 @,@ 000 units in its first week , and entered the Billboard 200 at No. 88 . 
 The album did exceptionally well overseas where it entered the Mainstream Top 20 in the German and Belgium charts at No. 12 , No. 14 in Australia , No. 16 in the United Kingdom and No. 19 in Sweden . Charting positions below the Top 20 consisted of Ireland at No. 23 , No. 29 in the Netherlands , No. 34 in France and No. 55 in Italy . The Blackening sold more copies in two weeks than Through the Ashes of Empires sold in three years .

 The artwork for The Blackening was designed by Robb Flynn , longtime Machine Head collaborator Paul Brown , and Deanna Alcorn . Based on a metal carving in the 16th century , these carvings were used to scare people about going to Hell and for propaganda purposes . It features a skeleton on a throne that is standing on top of the world , and the words " The mirror which flatters not . " Flynn thought " this whole record is like holding up a mirror to ourselves . It 's talking about things that are going on now , but it 's not necessarily specific to this time . " 
 Three special editions of The Blackening were released : a two @-@ LP gatefold vinyl , a two @-@ disc special edition packaged in a silver foil @-@ enhanced slipcase , with a bonus Metallica cover added to the end of the album . The second disc was a DVD featuring a video entitled The Making of The Blackening , and a 2006 tour diary of the Sounds of the Underground Tour . Both of these versions were released in 2007 . 
 The third version , released in 2008 , was a 3 @-@ disc set which came with the original album , a CD featuring various covers the band had recorded in the past , demos and other unreleased material and a DVD which featured various live performances of the band at festivals , the Burn My Eyes 10th anniversary show and music videos from The Blackening accompanied by their " making 's of " .

 = Fort Stanton ( Washington , D.C. ) = 
 Fort Stanton was a Civil War @-@ era fortification constructed in the hills above Anacostia in the District of Columbia , USA , and was intended to prevent Confederate artillery from threatening the Washington Navy Yard . It also guarded the approach to the bridge that connected Anacostia ( then known as Uniontown ) with Washington . Built in 1861 , the fort was expanded throughout the war and was joined by two subsidiary forts : Fort Ricketts and Fort Snyder . Following the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia , it was dismantled and the land returned to its original owner . It never saw combat . Abandoned after the war , the site of the fort was planned to be part of a grand " Fort Circle " park system encircling the city of Washington . Though this system of interconnected parks never was fully implemented , the site of the fort is today a park maintained by the National Park Service , and a historical marker stands near the fort 's original location . 
 = = Planning and construction = = 
 Following the secession of Virginia and that state joining the Confederacy , Federal troops marched from Washington into the Arlington region of northern Virginia . The move was intended to forestall any attempt by Virginia militia or Confederate soldiers to seize the capital city of the United States . Over the next seven weeks , forts were constructed along the banks of the Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges ( Chain Bridge , Long Bridge , and Aqueduct Bridge ) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown . 
 While the Potomac River forts were being built , planning and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts to protect the city . Unlike the fortifications under construction , the new forts would defend the city in all directions , not just the most direct route through Arlington . In mid @-@ July , this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run . As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas , the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle . In the days that followed the Union defeat at Bull Run , panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack . The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington . 
 On July 26 , 1861 , five days after the battle , Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was named commander of the military district of Washington and the subsequently renamed Army of the Potomac . Upon arriving in Washington , McClellan was appalled by the condition of the city 's defenses . " In no quarter were the dispositions for defense such as to offer a vigorous resistance to a respectable body of the enemy , either in the position and numbers of the troops or the number and character of the defensive works ... not a single defensive work had been commenced on the Maryland side . There was nothing to prevent the enemy shelling the city from heights within easy range , which could be occupied by a hostile column almost without resistance . " 
 To remedy the situation , one of McClellan 's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the defenses of Washington . At all points of the compass , forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to defeat any attack . One area of particular concern was the region of Maryland south of the Anacostia River . Confederate artillery floated across the Potomac in secret and mounted south of the river could threaten the Washington Navy Yard and Washington Arsenal , both of which lay at the junction of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers . 
 To prevent that threat from coming to pass , Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard , chief engineer of the defenses of Washington , directed that a line of forts be constructed on the heights southeast of the Anacostia River . From Fort Greble at the western end to Fort Mahan at the eastern end , the forts along the Eastern Branch River ( as the Anacostia was then known ) were not intended to constitute a continuous defensive line as was the Arlington Line that defended the Virginia approaches to the city . Instead , they were merely intended to deny Confederate artillery the position and to provide warning of any sneak attack upon Washington from the southeast . General Barnard illustrated this in an October 1862 report , saying , " As the enemy cannot enter the city from this direction , the object of the works is to prevent him seizing these heights , and occupying them long enough to shell the navy @-@ yard and arsenal . For this , the works must be made secure against assault , and auxiliary to this object is the construction of roads by which succor can be readily thrown to any point menaced . " 
 Fort Stanton , located in the Garfield Heights , was the first fort of this line to begin construction . Begun in September 1861 , the fort was located almost directly south of the Washington Navy Yard and the Navy Yard Bridge that crossed the Anacostia River and connected Uniontown , a suburb of Washington , with the city itself . Work progressed rapidly , and by Christmas , a report by General Barnard indicated the fort was " completed and armed . " 
 Despite that speed , not everything went in the engineers ' favor . Barnard 's report indicates " the sites of Fort ... Stanton and others were entirely wooded , which , in conjunction with the broken character of the ground , has made the selection of sites frequently very embarrassing and the labor of preparing them very great . " The experience of surveying and preparing the site of Fort Stanton would serve the engineers well in the construction of future forts around Washington and in service to the Army of the Potomac . Clearing brush and forest away from the site of Fort Stanton allowed for clear fields of fire for the fort 's cannon for several hundred yards in each direction , a technique that would be applied ( and later used ) to great effect at Fort Stevens . 
 = = Wartime operation = = 
 By the summer of 1862 , the fort was already being heavily used . A garrison had been assigned in the winter , and the 1862 report of the Commission to Study the Defenses of Washington describes Fort Stanton as " a work of considerable dimensions , well built , and tolerably well armed . Casemates for reversed fires are recommended in northwest and southwest counterscarp angles , and platforms for two or three rifled guns on the east front . The deep ravine which flanks this work on two sides requires some additional precaution , and further study of it is recommended . " 
 The commission had been ordered by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to inspect each of the forts surrounding Washington in late 1862 and make a report on the deficiencies of each . In addition to examining Fort Stanton , the commission analyzed two smaller works that supported Fort Stanton . Fort Ricketts was identified in the report as " a battery intended to see the ravine in front of Fort Stanton , which it does but imperfectly , " while Fort Snyder " may be regarded as an outwork to Fort Stanton , guarding the head of one branch of the ravine just mentioned . Except additional platforms for field guns , and a ditch in front of the gorge stockade , and blockhouses , nothing further seems necessary . " 
 To support Fort Stanton and its two subsidiary positions , a military road was constructed from Uniontown to the fort . Tributary roads led from Fort Stanton to the other forts in the Eastern Branch line . These roads were eventually widened into a large ring road that circled most of the 37 @-@ mile perimeter of Washington , a fact that can be noted in the 1865 map of the city 's defenses . In fall 1862 , however , the commission examining the defenses noted that " the work on roads about Washington requires ten regiments for twenty days ... or an equivalent of labor in some other shape . " 
 An 1864 inspection by Brig. Gen. Albion P. Howe , Inspector @-@ General of Artillery , found Fort Stanton to be well @-@ equipped , but the garrison poorly trained . The fort was armed with six 32 @-@ pounder barbettes , three 24 @-@ pounder field howitzers , four 8 @-@ inch siege howitzers , one <unk> mortar , and one 4 @-@ inch rifled mortar . The ammunition was listed as " complete and <unk> , " but the 131 men of a single company of the Heavy Massachusetts Volunteer Artillery that comprised the garrison at the time were " not drilled in artillery ; some in infantry . " 
 Following the Confederate raid on Washington that resulted in the Battle of Fort Stevens , new assessments were made of weak spots in Washington 's defenses . In the three years between the construction of Fort Stanton and the attack on Fort Stevens , Fort Stanton 's perimeter had been greatly increased with the addition of two subsidiary forts and additional rifle pits and trenches , as well as the completion of the military ring road . A report by Maj. Gen. Christopher C. Augur of the U.S. Volunteers recommended Fort Stanton receive one 32 @-@ pounder howitzer , two 4 ½ -inch rifled guns , four 12 @-@ pounder howitzers , and two 12 @-@ pounder Napoleons to bolster its defenses and control its position at the center of the Eastern Branch defenses . 
 In August 1864 , Gen. Barnard was replaced in his capacity as chief engineer of the defenses of Washington by Lt. Col. Barton S. Alexander . With the war winding down , Alexander 's duties consisted primarily of maintaining and expanding the already @-@ existing defenses , rather than building new forts as Barnard had done . An October 1864 report from Col. Alexander to Brig. Gen. Richard Delafield , head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , lists a series of improvements to Fort Stanton 's already @-@ impressive defenses . " Constructing three bastions , two new magazines , bomb @-@ proofs , traverses , platforms , embrasures , grading glacis , and renewing abatis , " the report reads . 
 = = Post @-@ war use = = 
 After the surrender of Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9 , 1865 , the primary reason for manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist . Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander , chief engineer of the Washington defenses , were to divide the defenses into three classes : those that should be kept active ( first @-@ class ) , those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state ( second @-@ class ) , and those that should be abandoned entirely ( third @-@ class ) . Fort Stanton fell into the first @-@ class category , as it was thought that the fort would be needed to defend the Washington Navy Yard . 
 Thanks to its status as a first @-@ class fortification , Fort Stanton continued to receive regular maintenance and was continually garrisoned even after the final armistice . Work was even done to strengthen the defenses , as a stockade was added in the summer of 1865 , and the parapets of the fort were re @-@ sodded with fresh grass for better traction and to improve the look of the fortification . 
 = = = Abandonment = = = 
 With the conclusion of the fighting , however , military budgets were slashed , and even the forts that were designated for second- and first @-@ class status were deemed surplus . The guns were removed , surplus equipment sold , and the land returned to its original owners . Fort Stanton itself was officially closed on March 20 , 1866 . Following the closure , the fort was abandoned to the elements , and the woods of Anacostia rapidly reclaimed the land . 
 In 1873 , journalist George Alfred Townsend published Washington , Outside and Inside . A Picture and A Narrative of the Origin , Growth , <unk> , Abuses , Beauties , and <unk> of Our Governing City , a work that covered the history of Washington from its inception to the then @-@ present day . The Civil War defenses of Washington figure prominently in the later portions of the book , and he uses the state of Fort Stanton as an example of what had become of the forts a decade after they had been built . 
 = = = The Fort Circle Parks = = = 
 The fort remained in a constantly deteriorating condition until 1919 , when the Commissioners of the District of Columbia pushed Congress to pass a bill that would consolidate the aging forts into a " Fort Circle " system of parks that would ring the growing city of Washington . As envisioned by the Commissioners , the Fort Circle would be a green ring of parks outside the city , owned by the government , and connected by a " Fort Drive " road in order to allow Washington 's citizens to easily escape the confines of the capital . However , the bill allowing for the purchase of the former forts , which had been turned back over to private ownership after the war , failed to pass both the House of Representatives and Senate . 
 Despite that failure , in 1925 a similar bill passed both the House and Senate , which allowed for the creation of the National Capital Parks Commission ( NCPC ) to oversee the construction of a Fort Circle of parks similar to that proposed in 1919 . The NCPC was authorized to begin purchasing land occupied by the old forts , much of which had been turned over to private ownership following the war . Records indicate that the site of Fort Stanton was purchased for a total of $ 56 @,@ 000 in 1926 . The duty of purchasing land and constructing the fort parks changed hands several times throughout the 1920s and 1930s , eventually culminating with the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service taking control of the project in the 1940s . 
 During the Great Depression , crews from the Civilian Conservation Corps embarked on projects to improve and maintain the parks , which were still under the control of District authority at that time . At Fort Stanton , CCC members trimmed trees and cleared brush , as well as maintaining and constructing park buildings . Various non @-@ park buildings were also discussed for the land . The City Department of Education proposed building a school on park land , while authorities from the local water utility suggested the construction of a water tower would be suitable for the tall hills of the park . The Second World War interrupted these plans , and post @-@ war budget cuts instituted by President Harry S. Truman postponed the construction of the Fort Drive once more . Though land for the parks had mostly been purchased , construction of the ring road connecting them was pushed back again and again . Other projects managed to find funding , however . In 1949 , President Truman approved a supplemental appropriation request of $ 175 @,@ 000 to construct " a swimming pool and associated facilities " at Fort Stanton Park . 
 By 1963 , when President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress to finally build the Fort Circle Drive , many in Washington and the National Park Service were openly questioning whether the plan had outgrown its usefulness . After all , by this time , Washington had grown past the ring of forts that had protected it a century earlier , and city surface roads already connected the parks , albeit not in as linear a route as envisioned . The plan to link Fort Stanton Park with other fort parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped in the years that followed . 
 = = = Continuing use = = = 
 Not all the land that made up the site of Fort Stanton was converted to public park land . In 1920 , local African @-@ American Catholics constructed Our Lady of Perpetual Help church on land formerly owned by Dr. J.C. Norwood , a local physician . After the remaining grounds of the fort were purchased in 1925 , nearby residents reportedly " walked family cows to Fort Stanton Park to graze before the school bell rang . " Today , the church still stands adjacent to the grounds of the park . The Washington D.C. Department of Parks and National Park Service jointly manage the 67 acres of park land that stand on the site of the fort today . D.C. authorities manage approximately 11 acres that contain a recreation center and ball fields , while the National Park Service manages the remaining acreage , which is mostly wooded and contains the remains of forts Stanton and Ricketts . The area also is site to the Anacostia Museum , a Smithsonian Institution facility devoted to the history of African @-@ Americans . 
 = A Song for Simeon = 
 A Song for Simeon is a 37 @-@ line poem written in 1928 by American @-@ English poet T. S. Eliot ( 1888 – 1965 ) . It is one of five poems that Eliot contributed to the Ariel poems series of 38 pamphlets by several authors published by Faber and Gwyer . " A Song for Simeon " was the sixteenth in the series and included an illustration by avant garde artist Edward McKnight Kauffer . The poems , including " A Song for Simeon " , were later published in both the 1936 and 1963 editions of Eliot 's collected poems . 
 In 1927 , Eliot had converted to Anglo @-@ Catholicism and his poetry , starting with the Ariel Poems ( 1927 – 31 ) and Ash Wednesday ( 1930 ) , took on a decidedly religious character . " A Song for Simeon " is seen by many critics and scholars as a discussion of the conversion experience . In the poem , Eliot retells the story of Simeon from the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke , a just and devout Jew who encounters Mary , Joseph and the infant Jesus entering the Temple of Jerusalem . Promised by the Holy Ghost that he would not die until he had seen the Saviour , Simeon sees in the infant Jesus the Messiah promised by the Lord and asks God to permit him to " depart in peace " ( Luke 2 : 25 – 35 ) . 
 The poem 's narrative echoes the text of the Nunc dimittis , a liturgical prayer for Compline derived from the Gospel passage . Eliot introduces literary allusions to earlier writers Lancelot Andrewes , Dante Alighieri and St. John of the Cross . Several critics have debated whether Eliot 's depiction of Simeon is a negative portrayal of a Jewish figure and evidence of anti @-@ Semitism on Eliot 's part . 
 = = Writing and publication = = 
 In 1925 , Eliot became a poetry editor at the London publishing firm of Faber and Gwyer , Ltd . , after a career in banking , and subsequent to the success of his earlier poems , including " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock " ( 1915 ) , " Gerontion " ( 1920 ) and " The Waste Land " ( 1922 ) . In these years , Eliot gravitated away from his Unitarian upbringing and began to embrace the Church of England . He was baptised into the Anglican faith on 29 June 1927 at <unk> , in Oxfordshire , and was confirmed the following day in the private chapel of Thomas Banks Strong , Bishop of Oxford . Eliot converted in private , but subsequently declared in his 1927 preface to a collection of essays titled For Lancelot Andrewes that he considered himself a classicist in literature , a royalist in politics , and an Anglo @-@ Catholic in religion . When his conversion became known , it was " an understandable choice to those around him " given his intellectual convictions , and that " he could not have done anything less than seek what he regarded as the most ancient , most sacramental , and highest expression of the Christian faith that forms the indisputable basis for the culture and civilization of modern Europe " . Eliot 's conversion and his adherence to Anglo @-@ Catholicism informed and influenced his later poetry . 
 Critical reviews of Eliot 's poems shifted as well , with some critics asserting that Eliot 's work suffered with the addition of Christian themes . One critic , Morton Zabel said that this " deprived his art of its once incomparable distinction in style and tone " . Other critics thought Eliot 's exploration of Christian themes was a positive development in his poetry , including Gordon Symes , who recognised it as " an evaluation of old age , an elucidation of its special grace , and an appreciation of its special function in the progress of the soul " . 
 In 1927 , Eliot was asked by his employer , Geoffrey Faber , to write one poem each year for a series of illustrated pamphlets with holiday themes to be sent to the firm 's clients and business acquaintances as Christmas greetings . This series , called the " Ariel Series " , consisted of 38 pamphlets published between 1927 and 1931 featuring poems and brief prose from a selection of English writers and poets . The first poem that Eliot wrote , " The Journey of the Magi " , was printed as the eighth in the series in August 1927 . For the second , " A Song for Simeon " , Eliot turned to an event at the end of Nativity narrative in the Gospel of Luke . The printing of the poem , the sixteenth in the series , was completed on 24 September 1928 . Eliot would follow these with three more poems : " <unk> " in October 1929 , " Marina " in September 1930 , and " Triumphal March " in October 1931 . Four of Eliot 's five Ariel poems , including " A Song for Simeon " , were accompanied by illustrations by American @-@ born avant garde artist , E. McKnight Kauffer . 
 Faber and Gwyer printed " A Song for Simeon " in an 8 ½ -inch × 5 ½ -inch <unk> Octavo ( <unk> ) pamphlet in blue paper wraps with title in black ink . The poem was printed on two pages , accompanied by a colour image by Kauffer , and included one page of advertisements . Faber and Gwyer contracted with the Curwen Press in Plaistow to print 3 @,@ 500 copies . The font of the cover and poem text was Walbaum , created by J. E. Walbaum of Goslar and Weimar in Germany in 1836 . According to Gilmour , the edition was printed " in batches of eight " . 
 In 1936 , Faber and Faber , the successor firm to Faber and Gwyer , collected " A Song for Simeon " and the four other poems under the heading " Ariel Poems " for an edition of Eliot 's collected poems . When Faber released the entire series in the 1950s , Eliot included a sixth poem , " The Cultivation of Christmas Trees " , which was added to Faber 's 1963 edition of his collected poems . Both editions of collected poems were published in the United States by Harcourt , Brace & Company . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 " A Song for Simeon " is a 37 @-@ line poem written in free verse . The poem does not have a consistent pattern of meter . The lines range in length from three syllables to fifteen syllables . Eliot uses end rhyme sporadically in 21 lines of the poem , specifically : 
 and , hand , stand , and land ( in lines 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ) 
 poor and door ( lines 10 and 12 ) 
 sorrow and to @-@ morrow ( lines 20 and 24 ) 
 derision and vision ( lines 27 and 30 ) 
 stair and prayer ( lines 28 and 29 ) 
 heart and depart ( lines 32 and 36 ) 
 Eliot 's use of lamentation , desolation and consolation — a repetition of the two @-@ syllable <unk> ending — is an example of syllable rhyme . Eliot employs forced rhyme ( also called " oblique rhyme " ) on peace and ease ( lines 8 and 11 ) , and eye rhyme on home and come ( lines 14 and 15 ) . 
 " A Song for Simeon " is structured as a first @-@ person dramatic monologue spoken by Simeon . Eliot 's style of monologue used in the poem ( and in many of his works ) draws heavily from the influence of English Victorian poet Robert Browning ( 1812 – 1889 ) . Literary scholar Martin Scofield directly identifies Simeon 's recitation as " the voice of the <unk> dramatic monologue " and characterises Eliot 's use of Simeon as a speaker as a " mask that half hides and half reveals the poet " .

 = = = Gospel narrative and the Nunc dimittis = = = 
 Most scholars and critics addressing the poem focus on the Gospel narrative for a source of interpretation as Eliot 's poem quotes several lines verbatim from the passage in Luke , from the Nunc dimittis . Scofield says that the poem is " characterized by deliberately Biblical language , interwoven with actual phrases from the Gospels " . 
 The subject of Eliot 's poem is drawn from the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke ( Luke 2 : 25 – 35 ) , and the early Christian canticle Nunc dimittis derived from it . In Luke 's account , Simeon , an aged and devout Jew , stands in the Temple of Jerusalem at the time Mary and Joseph bring the infant Jesus to be presented in the temple forty days after his birth in accordance with Jewish law and custom . Luke states that Simeon is " waiting for the consolation of Israel " after being promised that " he should not see death before he had seen the Lord 's Christ " . ( Luke 2 : 25 – 26 ) Simeon , upon seeing the child , takes him into his arms and prays , <unk> the redemption of the world by Jesus and of suffering to come . This prayer would become known later as the Nunc dimittis from its Latin incipit . 
 The Nunc dimittis is the traditional " Gospel Canticle " of Night Prayer that is often called the Song of Simeon or Canticle of Simeon . In the Roman Catholic tradition , it was used during the Office for Compline , the last of the Canonical hours , in the Liturgy of the Hours . The Anglican tradition combined liturgy of the Catholic offices of Vespers ( especially with the Magnificat canticle ) and Compline ( with the Nunc dimittis ) into Evening Prayer when compiling the Book of Common Prayer during the English Reformation . 
 In 1886 , Eliot 's grandfather , William Greenleaf Eliot , an American educator and Unitarian minister , wrote a poem titled " Nunc dimittis " . Written a few months before his death ( and two years before T. S. Eliot 's birth , ) the elder Eliot 's poem used the same gospel text and the poet asks , in his decline , " When may I humbly claim that kind award , / And cares and labors cease ? " " A Song for Simeon " has been seen by the Reverend Robin Griffith @-@ Jones , an Anglican cleric , as a tacit tribute by Eliot to his grandfather , " for the last years of a grandfather whose faith his grandson has at last taken up for himself " . 
 Scholars have identified allusions by Eliot to other biblical passages , including : 
 " Before the stations of the mountain of desolation " in line 19 and the reference to " the fox 's home " in line 15 as a reference to Calvary ( Golgotha ) , or to Lamentations 5 : 17 – 18 " the mountain of <unk> ... is desolate , the foxes walk upon it " . The fox reference is also thought to be connected to Mark 13 : 14 , and Mark 8 : 20 . 
 The stations in line 19 , and the time of cords , scourges and lamentation in line 17 refers to Christ 's passion and crucifixion , in particular his scourging at the orders of Pontius Pilate and the lamenting of women along the Via Dolorosa described in Luke 33 : 27 – 29 . 
 " The goat 's path " of line 15 is a reference to the scapegoat of Leviticus 16 : 22 . 
 " Fleeing from foreign faces and the foreign swords " is from prophesies of grief , hiding , and pursuit in Isaiah 51 : 3 ; and crucifixion events mentioned in Mark 13 : 8 and Matthew 24 : 8 . Two scholars connect this to Ezekiel 's prophesy of " death by the hands of strangers " . 
 The influence of Psalm 104 on the language of the poem . 
 = = = Conversion = = = 
 " A Song for Simeon " is not considered by scholars and critics to be one of Eliot 's significant poems . It is thus overshadowed by his comparatively better known works of the period — " The Hollow Men " ( 1925 ) , written before his conversion ; and " The Journey of the Magi " ( 1927 ) , " Ash Wednesday " ( 1930 ) , and the later , more substantial Four Quartets ( 1943 ) , written after his conversion . However , in " A Song for Simeon " and these poems , Eliot continues the progression of his themes of alienation in a changing world , and fuses with this the tenets of his newfound faith . Scofield states that the imagery of " A Song for Simeon " — including the symbol of a feather , its setting amid Roman hyacinths and the winter sun — conveys " a sense of wonder and fragile new life " . Robin Griffith @-@ Jones draws a connection between Eliot 's image of the feather to a statement by Hildegard of Bingen comparing herself " to ' a feather which lacks all weight and strength and flies through the wind ' ; so she was borne up by God . But Eliot 's speaker , still waiting for the wind to blow , imagines only the death wind that will bear him away " . 
 According to writer Joseph <unk> , " A Song for Simeon " shares themes with his more famous conversion poem " Ash Wednesday " , the first parts of which Eliot was writing when " A Song for Simeon " was written and published . Eliot uses the biblical story of Simeon to illustrate the " contrast between appearance and reality and humbly begs God to teach him the stillness that unifies the two " . Eliot 's Ariel poems and " Ash Wednesday " explore this new experience of conversion and the progress of the soul . Scofield writes that Eliot 's depiction of Simeon presents " a figure to whom revelation has been granted but to whom it has come too late for this life " . But as he awaits the death for which he asks , Simeon sees the consequences of the turning of faith to this new child and his mission . Simeon wants nothing of this " time of sorrow " and that the fate of persecution for the consequences of faith is not for him . 
 According to Eliot biographer Lyndall Gordon , in " Ash Wednesday " and the Ariel poems , " Eliot wonders if he does not belong to those who espouse Christianity officially without being properly committed , whose ostentatious piety is ' tainted with a self @-@ conceit . ' " The poem is inherently tied to Eliot 's religious conversion experience , and connected to Eliot 's reading of Anglican divine Lancelot Andrewes during this time . Andrewes , in an 1619 Ash Wednesday sermon , emphasised that conversion " must come from both mind and heart , thought and feeling , ' the principall [ sic ] and most proper act of a true turning to God . ' " Andrewes ' words are channelled again , when Eliot 's Simeon " sees a faith that he cannot inhabit in " the still <unk> and unspoken Word ' " . Eliot uses the image of the winding staircase — an image that also appears in " Ash Wednesday " — which Gordon indicates is a direct reference to Andrewes ' sermon . According to Gordon , " Eliot 's penitent ... ' turning on the winding stair ' , acts out the two mental turns Andrewes prescribed for a conversion : a turn that looks forward to God and a turn that looks backward to one ’ s sins , sentencing oneself for the past " . 
 The image of a winding stair has also been tied to scenes in Dante 's journey from Purgatory to Paradise in the Divine Comedy . Further , the image is thought associated with stairs as the path of mystical ascent in the writings of sixteenth @-@ century Spanish mystic Saint John of the Cross . Eliot often alludes to this symbol in several of his poems . 
 Eliot 's Simeon appears similar to Dante 's depiction of Virgil in the Divine Comedy , as " the seer who can see only so far ; the precursor who cannot enter the world that he makes possible " . Virgil , in the Divine Comedy , leads Dante through Hell ( Inferno ) and Purgatory ( Purgatorio ) , but cannot guide him into Paradise ( Paradiso ) . In this context , Virgil was a symbol of non @-@ Christian philosophy and humanities could not help Dante any further in his approach to God . In Eliot 's depiction , Simeon will never know the Christian culture he <unk> , sensing " the birth @-@ pangs of a world that he will never occupy " . 
 = = = Arguments over anti @-@ Semitism = = = 
 Eliot 's poems have frequently been examined for instances of anti @-@ Semitism — prejudice or discrimination against Jews . Scholar Louis Menand states that while Simeon is treated respectfully by Eliot , his characterisation is " in the tradition of Christian condescension toward the virtuous heathen " . Comparatively , Craig Raine , a poet and an Emeritus Fellow of New College , Oxford , wrote a book @-@ length defence of Eliot against the claims of deliberate anti @-@ Semitism and argues that " A Song for Simeon " provides a sympathetic discussion of the Jewish diaspora . University of British Columbia scholar John <unk> Cooper states that the accusations of anti @-@ Semitism lodged against Eliot rest " on a few isolated lines of poetry " and a passing reference in one prose text . Indeed , Eliot denied the claim , declaring , " I am not an anti @-@ Semite and never have been . It is a terrible slander on a man . " Political theorist and author Leonard Woolf , who was both Jewish and one of Eliot 's close friends , believed that Eliot was " slightly anti @-@ Semitic in the sort of vague way which is not uncommon . He would have denied it genuinely . " 
 Anthony Julius , a British lawyer who is one of Eliot 's most trenchant critics on this issue , writes that " A Song for Simeon " is " exceptional in a poetry in which elsewhere Jews are dumb . The voice , however is a disciplined one and speaks lines prepared for it ... . The song is for , not of Simeon . Eliot gives the Jew lines that locate him , and by implication all Jews , wholly within the Christian drama . Incapable of denying its truth , but equally incapable of living that truth . " He accuses Eliot of animating " the topoi of the Jew acknowledging his obsolescence " — essentially employing a tired characterisation of a Jewish figure as a voice attesting that Jews have no role in the Christian future . Julius compares Simeon to Moses stating that he is " fated to see the Promised Land but not to enter it ... witness to its truth , but denied its redemptive power , the Jew stands solemnly , humbly , outside Christianity 's gates " . Further , Julius draws on a quote from Eliot 's earlier poem " Gerontion " to say that in this Christian future the Jews " may find a ledge there to squat on " . 
 Julius ' view is considered extreme by many critics . Comparatively , Julius tempered his harsh criticism by claiming that Eliot 's anti @-@ Semitism does not detract from the poetry and that it offers a creative force showing rare imaginative power to Eliot 's art . Literary critic and professor Christopher Ricks agreed , citing the wit and commentary of Eliot 's depictions of Jews ; he asserts that Eliot was at his most brilliant in his prejudice .

 = = College career = = 
 Tarwater attended the University of Michigan from 2002 to 2006 , where he earned a bachelor 's degree in political science . During his first year , coach Jon Urbanchek began entering Tarwater in butterfly events . " I was a distance freestyler in high school , so ... at first it was a difficult adjustment " , Tarwater said of the move . " But it was what the team needed , and it let me contribute as a freshman . " During the summer , he was selected to represent the United States at the 2003 Pan American Games where he placed sixth in the 400 @-@ meter freestyle . 
 Urbanchek 's decision and Tarwater 's training started to pay dividends in 2004 . That year , Tarwater set his first conference record by swimming the 200 @-@ yard butterfly in 1 : 43 @.@ 46 en route to the Big Ten title . He was part of the university 's 4 × 200 @-@ meter freestyle team that took first place at the NCAA Championships . The group 's time of 7 : 01 @.@ 42 set a new U.S. Open record .

 Bob Bowman took over as head coach of Michigan for the 2004 – 05 season . He put Tarwater on a new training program , with a greater focus on speed training and less on distance . " We 've also put him through weight training , and I think it 's been improving his speed " , Bowman said . " He has a very strong work ethic and always wants to improve . Instead of just getting in the pool and doing what we tell him to do , he actually thinks about it and asks questions . He wants to know the theory behind what he 's doing . " Tarwater won the 2005 NCAA championship in the 200 @-@ yard butterfly . His time of 1 : 42 @.@ 30 was a Michigan and Big Ten record , and the third fastest time in NCAA history .

 After graduation , Tarwater continued to train at the Michigan facilities with one goal in mind : qualifying for the 2008 Olympics . " I hadn 't intended to swim professionally after college , " he later said , " but I had continued to improve , " and it " made sense " financially to continue swimming . In August 2006 , he placed second in the 200 @-@ meter butterfly at the U.S. National Championships with a time of 1 : 57 @.@ 00 , qualifying him for the 2007 World Championships . He also teamed up with Klete Keller , Matthew Patton , and Alex Vanderkaay to win the 4 × 200 @-@ meter freestyle trophy , winning by more than six seconds .

 = = = 2008 Olympic Trials = = = 
 In preparation for the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials , Tarwater trained at Michigan with Phelps , Peter Vanderkaay , and Erik Vendt , coached by Bowman and <unk> . Shortly before the trials , he went the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs , Colorado to train at altitude . " I 'm better mentally than I 've ever been , " Tarwater said of his preparation . " Physically I 'm stronger than four years ago . " He entered the Trials as the number two seed in the 200 @-@ meter butterfly and was widely expected to make the U.S. Olympic team as the second qualifier behind Phelps . " For the last two years I have completely put everything in my life aside to try to make [ my Olympic ] dream come true , " he told a reporter . He also entered the trials as the fourth seed in the 100 @-@ meter butterfly and qualified for the 100- and 200 @-@ meter freestyle . 
 In the preliminary round of the 200 @-@ meter butterfly , Tarwater turned in the fastest time , acknowledging that nerves played a role in his fast swim . In the semi @-@ finals , he achieved a new personal best of 1 : 54 @.@ 72 and finished with the second @-@ fastest time , just seven @-@ tenths of a second slower than Phelps . " It felt great , but there 's still no celebrating for me , " he said about the swim . In the finals , Tarwater was exactly tied with Phelps and on world @-@ record pace through the first 50 meters . He stayed near Phelps for 150 meters before fading on the last 50 . In the last 25 meters , he was passed by Gil Stovall , who beat his personal best by a second and a half , to finish third . Tarwater also swam a new personal best – 1 : 54 @.@ 46 – but it was not good enough to make the Olympic team , missing out by six @-@ tenths of a second . After the race , he briefly considered retiring before deciding to finish the meet . " I don 't know what the future is going to bring , but I didn 't want to go out knowing I didn 't get back up , " he said . He finished eighth in the 100 @-@ meter butterfly ; earlier , he failed to make the finals in the freestyle events . 
 Tarwater was devastated by the trial results , later saying , " It was the most empty feeling in the world . " He went home to Knoxville to reflect on swimming and life in general . He told his parents that he could not stand hearing coverage of the Olympics , so his father quickly organized a vacation to Costa Rica . After returning home , Tarwater 's uncle , Richmond Flowers Jr . , was able to help him through the experience . In 1968 , Flowers had been a gold medal favorite in the hurdles before suffering a hamstring injury two months before the Olympic Trails . " I think he knew the pain I was feeling and the disappointment I was feeling , because he felt same thing , " Tarwater recalled . Flowers offered perspective , instead of comfort : " I believe there is a God who created this , and it ain 't no accident . He 's got a plan ... maybe it just wasn 't the right thing for you . " Soon after , Tarwater met pastor Doug Banister of All Souls Church in Knoxville . After several " really tough conversions " with Banister , Tarwater decided to " [ dedicate his ] life to Christ and basically relinquished control . " 
 Tarwater took Flowers ' advice to heart and started to look into other possibilities for his future . He applied to graduate school to study public policy , and on a friend 's advice sent some of his undergraduate work to Oxford University . He was accepted into St Antony 's College , Oxford for the 2009 – 2010 school year . 
 = = = Retirement and return to swimming = = = 
 At the 2009 National Championships , Tarwater qualified to represent the United States team in the World Championships for the third time in his career by placing sixth in the 200 @-@ meter freestyle . He also placed fourth in the 100 @-@ meter butterfly , and fifth in the 200 @-@ meter butterfly . In the preliminary round of the 4 × 200 @-@ meter freestyle , he helped the United States turn in the top qualifying time . The United States later won the event , earning Tarwater a gold medal . After the 2009 season , Tarwater decided to retire from competitive swimming and concentrate on his academic work at Oxford . 
 At Oxford , Tarwater found a new perspective on life : " I used to be in the sport for Davis Tarwater . Going to Oxford and seeing the selflessness and ambition of the students transitioned me to being in the sport as a mechanism to do good . " The Oxford swim team encouraged him to join its ranks , and he subsequently earned most valuable player honors and a Blue jacket , the British equivalent of a varsity letter . On his newfound perspective , Tarwater said , " Missing the Olympics in 2008 was the best thing that 's ever happened in my whole life ... [ otherwise ] I would not have gone to Oxford ; I would not have invested in my own personhood ... being able to chase an Olympic dream is a gift ... I made it a misery . It doesn 't have to be a misery . " He graduated from Oxford in 2010 with a master 's degree in Latin American studies . He described the year at Oxford as the best time of his life . 
 In October 2010 , responding to what he describes as a clear call from God , Tarwater returned to swimming full @-@ time . Back in the United States , he contacted David Marsh at his swimming club , SwimMAC Carolina . After talking with Marsh , Tarwater was convinced there was enough time before the 2012 Summer Olympics to make a comeback possible . " I realized that not only is there life left for me in swimming , there 's also a desire to come back [ to the Olympic Trials ] and do it the right way " , Tarwater remarked . Marsh introduced Tarwater to a new style of training which focused more on creating power rather than relying on aerobic endurance . Initially , he shifted his focus to the 200 @-@ meter freestyle , abandoning the butterfly for a while . 
 At his first major meet after his return , the May 2011 Charlotte <unk> , Tarwater placed third in the 200 @-@ meter butterfly behind China 's Wu Peng and Phelps . He also joined with three other SwimMAC Carolina members to win the 4 × 100 @-@ meter medley relay . At the National Championships in August , Tarwater placed third in the 100 @-@ meter and 200 @-@ meter butterfly . He anchored the national title @-@ winning 4 × 100 @-@ meter medley relay team for SwimMAC , and led off the club 's national title winning 4 × 200 @-@ meter freestyle relay . The medley relay time of 3 : 37 @.@ 70 set a new U.S. Open Record , more than six seconds ahead of the second @-@ place team . Tarwater also placed eighth in the 100 @-@ meter freestyle during the meet . 
 At the 2011 Duel in the Pool in December , Tarwater broke the American record in the 200 @-@ meter butterfly ( short course ) , completing the race in 1 : 51 @.@ 90 . The record was previously held by Michael Phelps with a time of 1 : 52 @.@ 26 . Tarwater finished second in the event , behind world record @-@ holder László Cseh , and also tied for third in the 100 @-@ meter butterfly during the meet . 
 = = = 2012 Olympic Trials = = = 
 Tarwater entered the June 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials with a new perspective : " I want to swim as fast as I can , be the best man I can be , and let the chips fall where they may " , he said . " If I make the team ... that would be unbelievable . If I don ’ t make this team , I plan to still be a champion . " He entered the competition ranked fourth in the 100 @-@ meter butterfly , fifth in the 200 @-@ meter butterfly , and also qualified in the 100 @-@ meter and 200 @-@ meter freestyle . He chose to scratch the 100 @-@ meter freestyle to concentrate on the 200 @-@ meter butterfly and freestyle . Tarwater made the 200 @-@ meter freestyle finals ; the top six finishers qualified for the Olympic 4 × 200 relay team , but Tarwater finished seventh . He missed making the Olympic team by fourteen one @-@ hundredths ( 0 @.@ 14 ) of a second . 
 In the 200 @-@ meter butterfly semi @-@ finals , Tarwater turned in the second @-@ fastest time behind Bobby <unk> as Phelps conserved energy . In the finals the next day , Tarwater , knowing he was facing several strong finishers , decided to go out as hard as he could and try to build a big enough lead to hold on . Tarwater led the field for the first 100 meters . Phelps passed him in the third 50 @-@ meter stretch , but Tarwater held off the rest of the field until the final 25 meters when both <unk> and Tyler Clary surged ahead , dropping Tarwater to fourth . His split on the final 50 meters was three seconds slower than his third 50 , and two seconds slower than his final lap in 2008 . A couple days later , Tarwater advanced to the 100 @-@ meter butterfly final , but finished fifth . Afterwards , he called it " the last race I 'll ever swim . " 
 The next morning Tarwater boarded a plane and headed home . Later that day , Phelps , facing the prospect of competing in eight events at the Olympics , elected to drop the 200 @-@ meter freestyle from his program . Phelps ' decision allowed Tarwater to move up into the sixth spot in the 200 @-@ meter freestyle and be added to the relay team . Tarwater said he was " shocked " by the news and called it a " storybook ending " to his career . " I was really content in walking away last night . I was in peace and left with my faith intact . To have this extra bout of joy is ... surreal " , he said . He immediately boarded another plane and flew back to Omaha , where the Trials were held , for a team meeting and practice . He told Olympic swim coach Gregg Troy , " you won 't see anyone show up with more focus and fire .... I will do everything I can to bolster the U.S. team . "

 By coincidence , Olympic team training took place in Tarwater 's hometown of Knoxville . At the Olympics , Tarwater swam the third leg of the preliminary round of the men 's 4 × 200 @-@ meter relay . His time of 1 : 46 @.@ 33 was a personal best , and the second @-@ fastest leg for Team USA , which turned in the fastest preliminary swim , and third @-@ fastest among all 64 swimmers . He attributed his performance to concentrating exclusively on the freestyle during the two months between Trials and the Games . Of his Olympic experience , Tarwater said , " Even at 28 , with a lot of international experience , nothing matches the Olympics . My heart was pumping so intensely that I was just trying to calm myself down . Standing on the blocks , waiting to take the exchange , I was just saying , ' Breathe . Breathe . Breathe . ' ... It 's such a rush . " Typically , the relay team for the finals is composed of the top two qualifiers plus the two fastest swimmers in the preliminaries . In 2012 , however , the U.S. team had its top three swimmers in reserve , as Phelps would swim the relay final despite dropping the individual 200 @-@ meter freestyle from his program . After Tarwater 's fast preliminary swim , the U.S. coaches strongly considered replacing number three Olympic Trials qualifier Ricky Berens with Tarwater in the finals , before electing to go with Berens due to Berens ' greater experience . In the finals , the U.S. relay team beat the second @-@ place French team by three seconds , winning Tarwater a gold medal . 
 Tarwater did not immediately announce whether he would retire again , saying , " I 'll make that decision when the meet is over . " He added , " I need a little bit of a vacation and I think during that time , I 'll decide what 's next for me and what 's best for my career and my life . "

 Tarwater is sponsored by Speedo and Mutual of Omaha . According to the Charlotte Observer , he was " known as one of the most versatile and gracious swimmers never to make an Olympic squad " before finally qualifying in 2012 . Webb School athletic director David <unk> said he was " someone that has always been humble , has worked extremely hard and has always been so positive " . Tarwater says his biggest mentor is his father , remarking , " He taught me how to be a man , but more importantly , how to be a champion . " 
 Tarwater was raised in a Christian home , but growing up he " sort of went through the motions " and didn 't really hold strong beliefs . By college , he had abandoned any pretense of faith . He later said that " the Olympics had become an idol in my life . " After not making the Olympics in 2008 , he met Doug Banister who challenged Tarwater to re @-@ examine his worldview . " The ' A @-@ ha ' moments were many , " Tarwater later recalled . " [ B ] y the time I had the ability to prayerfully repent and rebuke the stuff in my life , I was finally at a good time in life .... I would say I recommitted my life because I grew up in a Christian home , but really it was the first time where I knew what I was doing and committed my life to Christ . " Tarwater credits his Christian faith for helping him get through the ups and downs of being a competitive swimmer . On his 2012 Olympic experience , he said " It was a real gift from God . I felt His presence so much the past few weeks . It was an unbelievable feeling . " Tarwater attends Hope Community Church in Charlotte . 
 Tarwater has engaged in fundraising for Mott Children 's Hospital in Michigan , and has donated his time visiting patients there . When his swimming career is finished , he is interested in working on third world economic development .

 = Adenanthos obovatus = 
 Adenanthos obovatus , commonly known as basket flower or jugflower , is a shrub of the plant family Proteaceae endemic to Southwest Australia . Described by French naturalist Jacques Labillardière in 1805 , it had first been collected by Archibald Menzies in 1791 . Within the genus Adenanthos , it lies in the section Eurylaema and is most closely related to A. barbiger . A. obovatus has hybridized with A. detmoldii to produce the hybrid A. × pamela . Several common names allude to the prominent red flowers of the species . It grows as a many @-@ stemmed spreading bush up to 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) high , and about 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) across , with fine bright green foliage . Made up of single red flowers , the inflorescences appear from April to December , and peak in spring ( August to October ) . 
 The shrub grows on sandy soils in seasonally wet lowland areas as well as hills and dunes . It regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its underground lignotuber . Pollinators include honeyeaters , particularly the western spinebill , which can access the nectar with its long curved bill , and the silvereye , which punctures the flower tube . The most commonly cultivated Adenanthos species in Australia , it has a long flowering period and attracts honeyeaters to the garden . It is harvested for the cut flower industry . 
 = = Description = = 
 The growth habit of Adenanthos obovatus is that of a lignotuberous shrub , with many stems arising from a single underground lignotuber . It typically reaches about 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) in height , and about 1 @.@ 5 m in width , but plants occasionally reach a height of 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . 
 The leaves of this species are bright green , oval in shape , up to 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) long and 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) wide , sessile , and arranged in a spiral pattern on the branches . The flowers appear steadily between April and December , and are most frequent between August and October . They are red or orange , and emerge from the leaf axils . They are usually solitary , but occasionally an axil will carry two flowers . As with other Proteaceae species , each flower consists of a perianth of four united tepals , and a single style . In A. obovatus , the perianth is around 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) long , and the style around 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) . Although the flowering period is lengthy ( six months ) , there are generally only a few flowers at any one time , and a seven @-@ year study at Harry Waring <unk> Reserve south of Perth revealed fairly constant flowering from year to year , even when shrubs were cut back to ground level to simulate a bushfire . 
 The species is very similar to A. barbiger . There are obvious differences in typical leaf shape , with leaves of most populations of A. barbiger being very much longer and narrower than those of A. obovatus . However , leaf shape is variable in both species , and some southern populations of A. barbiger have leaves that are indistinguishable from those of A. obovatus . The most systematically important properties by which the two may be distinguished are the shape of the perianth limb , which is rounded in A. obovatus and pointed in A. barbiger ; the bracts , glabrous versus hirsute ; and the style @-@ ends , which are green and scarlet respectively . The species also differ slightly in range of flower colours : A. barbiger has scarlet to bright red flowers , whereas A. obovatus flowers are scarlet to orange . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 = = = Discovery and naming = = = 
 The first known botanical specimen collection of A. obovatus was made by Scottish surgeon and naturalist Archibald Menzies during the visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791 . However , this collection did not result in publication of the species . Other early collections include a specimen collected by Scottish botanist Robert Brown during the visit of HMS Investigator to King George Sound in December 1801 and January 1802 ; and , thirteen months later , King George Sound specimens collected by Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour , botanist to Nicolas Baudin 's voyage of exploration , and " gardener 's boy " Antoine <unk> . In his notes on vegetation published in the official account of the expedition , Leschenault writes : 
 " Sur les <unk> de la mer , croissent , en grande abondance , l 'adenanthos cuneata , l 'adenanthos sericea au <unk> velouté , et une espèce du même genre dont les <unk> sont <unk> . " 
 ( " On the seashore , grows , in great abundance , Adenanthos cuneata , the softer @-@ leaved Adenanthos sericea , and a species of the same genus with rounded leaves . " ) 
 The species with rounded leaves was A. obovatus . 
 A description of the species was published by Jacques Labillardière in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen , accompanied by a figure drawn by Pierre Antoine <unk> and engraved by Auguste <unk> . Labillardière chose the specific name obovata , in reference to the leaves of his specimen , which were obovate ( egg @-@ shaped , with the narrow end at the base ) . This leaf shape is often seen in this species . The term obovata derives from the Latin <unk> ( " inverse " ) and ovum ( " egg " ) , and has feminine gender , consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus . 
 Labillardière did not acknowledge any collector , and so it was long thought that Labillardière himself had collected the first botanical specimens in 1792 while naturalist to Bruni d 'Entrecasteaux 's expedition in search of the lost ships of Jean @-@ François de Galaup , comte de La Pérouse . However , this and eight other species described by Labillardière do not occur in any locations that he visited , suggesting that he obtained specimens from someone else whom he failed to credit . Though he did not specify a type specimen for A. obovata , a specimen upon which the accompanying figure in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen appears to be based has been located ; it is annotated , apparently in Labillardière 's hand , as having been collected by Leschenault . Ernest Charles Nelson states with certainty that Labillardière based this species on specimens collected by Leschenault , and this view has been accepted by some scholars though others treat it more cautiously . 
 = = = Infrageneric placement = = = 
 In 1870 , George Bentham published the first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis . Bentham divided the genus into two sections , placing A. obovata in A. sect . Eurylaema , defined as containing those species with one sterile stamen , and perianth tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle . 
 A phenetic analysis of the genus undertaken by Ernest Charles Nelson in 1975 yielded results in which the members of A. sect . Eurylaema occurred together , with A. obovata appearing most closely related to A. <unk> ( now A. barbiger ) , and then A. detmoldii . A. obovata was therefore retained in A. sect . Eurylaema in Ernest Charles Nelson 's 1978 revision of Adenanthos , and again in his 1995 treatment of the genus for the Flora of Australia series . By this time , the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in <unk> must be treated as having masculine gender . Hence the species is now known as Adenanthos obovatus . Its placement in Nelson 's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows : 
 Adenanthos 
 A. sect . Eurylaema 
 A. detmoldii 
 A. barbiger 
 A. obovatus 
 A. × pamela 
 A. sect . Adenanthos ( 29 species , 8 subspecies ) 
 = = = Hybrids = = = 
 Adenanthos obovatus hybridises with A. detmoldii to produce A. × pamela . Known only from road verges in the Scott River region , it was first discovered in 1979 , and it is now known from more than twenty individual plants . The discovery of it in such large numbers , together with its recognised horticultural potential , prompted Nelson to formally describe and name it in 1986 . Morphologically it is intermediate between its parents ; that is , taller than A. obovatus , with longer leaves and light red flowers . It is fertile , raising the possibility of the establishment of a hybrid swarm . 
 It is also possible that A. obovatus infrequently hybridises with A. barbiger : in 1921 , Carl Hansen <unk> described A. intermedia ( now A. intermedius ) , based on specimens found near <unk> Cave at <unk> with leaf shape intermediate between these two species . The new species was rejected in 1924 by Charles Gardner , and again in the 1970s by Nelson , who argued that leaf shape is inappropriate grounds for erecting a new species in this context , and that , in terms of systematically important characteristics , A. intermedius is indistinguishable from A. barbiger . He therefore synonymized A. intermedius with A. barbiger , but noted the possibility that A. intermedius is of hybrid origin . Recently , however , a specimen collected by Greg Keighery was held to represent a new species , provisionally named " A. barbiger subsp. intermedius ( <unk> . ) Keighery ms " ( later revised to " Adenanthos sp . Whicher Range ( G.J. Keighery <unk> ) " ) , suggesting that Keighery , at least , does not consider A. intermedius to be of hybrid origin . 
 = = = Common names = = = 
 Common names for this species include basket flower , <unk> , jugflower and stick @-@ in @-@ the @-@ jug . In the King George Sound vicinity the Aboriginal name <unk> is sometimes used . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Abundant and widespread , A. obovatus occurs on a wide range of soils , favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 4 . Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached siliceous sandplain sand . It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops , such as on the rocky <unk> of the Stirling Range . It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils . It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments ; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging — that niche is filled by A. detmoldii — but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging . 
 Consistent with these edaphic preferences , A. obovatus is widespread and common in the scrub and heath commonly found on the sandplains of Southwest Australia , and is also common in the <unk> that develop in moister areas of the region . It is uncommon in forest or woodland areas , because these are usually associated with lateritic soils ; but it may be found in stands of jarrah or marri forest where these grow in laterite @-@ free sand . The climate in its range is mediterranean , with annual rainfall from 625 – 1 @,@ 250 mm ( 24 @.@ 6 – 49 @.@ 2 in ) . 
 The species occurs in coastal regions of Southwest Australia , from Gingin and Muchea north of Perth south to Augusta and east along the south coast to Green Range , east of Albany . It also occurs in the Stirling Range , a possible disjunction ; and at Narrogin , a certain and substantial disjunction . Nelson tentatively explains these disjunct populations in terms of natural climate fluctuations : during times of higher rainfall , the distribution of A. obovatus would have been much more extensive . Reductions in rainfall would cause the distribution to contract , but isolated populations could survive in favourable refugia . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The western spinebill ( Acanthorhynchus superciliosus ) is the most frequent visitor to the flowers . A territorial species , the territories are smaller when they contain more Adenanthos obovatus bushes . Their long curved bills fit the tube @-@ like flowers exactly , so that the pollen @-@ presenter brushes against the spinebill 's head while it is probing for nectar . The birds then carry pollen from plant to plant , fertilising other plants . A field study marking the pollen with fluorescent dye found that pollen could be deposited on flowers of plants up to 20 metres ( 66 feet ) away from the original flower visited . The New Holland honeyeater ( Phylidonyris novaehollandiae ) and brown honeyeater ( Lichmera indistincta ) have also been recorded with pollen from A. obovatus . The silvereye ( Zosterops lateralis ) drinks nectar from the flowers , but punctures the tube with its short bill . Larger honeyeaters in one field study tended to avoid A. obovatus , possibly seeking sources of more abundant nectar elsewhere . These species are too heavy for the fine branches and their bills are too large for the tubes . 
 Adenanthos obovatus has been recorded as a source of nectar for the honey possum ( Tarsipes rostratus ) in winter and spring ( early June to September ) , from field studies in the Scott National Park , replaced by A. meisneri in late spring and summer ( late October to February ) . 
 Adenanthos obovatus is highly susceptible to dieback caused by the water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi . Specimens in coastal dune vegetation were reported killed by the fungus Armillaria luteobubalina , with mycelial sheaths of the fungus beneath the bark of the root collar . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Described by Ken <unk> as " an outstanding ornamental species with average foliage and very attractive in flower " , A. obovatus was first grown in Great Britain in 1824 , and is the most commonly cultivated Adenanthos species in Australia . It flowers for most of the year , is an excellent attractor of honeyeaters , and grows in a range of climates . Propagation is by cuttings of the current season 's growth , from which it strikes readily , and subsequently makes fairly quick growth . Despite its natural occurrence in damp locations , in cultivation it grows best in a light , well @-@ drained soil . It prefers a sunny aspect . Regular hard pruning is recommended to maintain an attractive form . Wildflowers of this species are harvested by licensed pickers in the cut flower industry , for sale in both local and export markets . The long , curved stems with flowers in the leaf axils have been described as " excellent for picking " . 
 = Ed , Edd n Eddy ( season 1 ) = 
 The first season of the Canadian @-@ American animated comedy television series Ed , Edd n Eddy , created by Danny Antonucci , originally aired on Cartoon Network in the United States . Although originally set to premiere in November 1998 , the season ran from January 4 , 1999 to June 11 , 1999 , and consists of 26 episodes . The series revolves around three adolescent boys collectively known as " the Eds , " who live in a suburban cul @-@ de @-@ sac . Unofficially led by Eddy , the Eds constantly scheme to make money off their peers in order to purchase their favorite confectionery , jawbreakers . However , their plans usually fail , leaving them in various predicaments . 
 Adult cartoonist Antonucci conceived Ed , Edd n Eddy while working on a commercial design . Antonucci pitched the series to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon . Both studios were interested in the series , but each demanded creative control and Antonucci refused . Cartoon Network ended up commissioning the show after agreeing to let Antonucci have control of the show . After its debut , the series was a success in Nielsen ratings , popular among younger and older viewers . Met with generally positive reviews , the season earned Antonucci a Reuben Award for Best Television Animation . 
 The Complete First Season DVD was released in Region 1 in 2006 and Region 4 in 2007 . Both Ed , Edd n Eddy DVD volumes , Edifying Ed @-@ Ventures and Fools ' Par @-@ Ed @-@ Ise , also featured season one episodes . All the DVDs were published by Warner Home Video . The entire season can also be purchased from the iTunes Store . The season was written by Antonucci , Jono Howard , Mike Kubat and Rob Boutilier .

 Despite not being as acclaimed as its second season , reception of the first season was still generally positive . Despite giving the Edifying Ed @-@ Ventures DVD a negative review , IGN 's Mike Drucker praised the show , saying : " Every bit of the show is played for the maximum comic effect , and the interactions between the characters are usually very fun , " and particularly praised the season finale , " Avast Ye Eds " , saying that it is a " good example of how the animators developed a clever , surreal environment that most kids could probably relate to . They simply go wild and allow regular childhood adventures turn into comedic epics , very over @-@ the @-@ top , but still linked to the way that kids act and react to strange situations . " While calling it a " gem " and of " entertaining nature " , he criticized the storylines as " repetitive " and said the show " lacks the genius of SpongeBob " . Terrence Briggs of Animation World Magazine considered every second of the show " filler " and lamented that the main characters are drawn as " products from the school of acid @-@ trip caricature . " After Briggs ' review was published , a large number of letters supportive of the show were sent to the magazine , prompting it to " take a second look " at the show . Different reviewers then gave it a positive review , calling it a " fresh show with very different approaches . " 
 The season earned Antonucci a Reuben Award for Best Television Animation . The season had a slight impact on popular culture .
