 = Kyle Broflovski = 
 Kyle Broflovski ( sometimes spelled <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ) is a main character in the Comedy Central series South Park . He is voiced by and loosely based on co @-@ creator Matt Stone . Kyle is one of the show 's four central characters , along with his friends Stan Marsh , Kenny McCormick , and Eric Cartman . He debuted on television when South Park first aired on August 13 , 1997 , after having first appeared in The Spirit of Christmas shorts created by Stone and long @-@ time collaborator Trey Parker in 1992 ( Jesus vs. Frosty ) and 1995 ( Jesus vs. Santa ) . 
 Kyle is a third- then fourth @-@ grade student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small @-@ town life in his fictional hometown of South Park , Colorado . Kyle is distinctive as one of the few Jewish children on the show , and because of this , he often feels like an outsider amongst the core group of characters . His portrayal in this role is often dealt with satirically , and has elicited both praise and criticism from Jewish viewers . 
 Kyle is animated by computer in a way to emulate the show 's original method of cutout animation . He also appears in the 1999 full @-@ length feature film South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut , as well as South Park @-@ related media and merchandise . While Parker and Stone portray Kyle as having common childlike tendencies , his dialogue is often intended to reflect stances and views on more adult @-@ oriented issues , and has been frequently cited in numerous publications by experts in the fields of politics , religion , popular culture , and philosophy . 
 = = Role in South Park = = 
 Kyle attends South Park Elementary as part of Mr. Garrison 's class . During the show 's first 58 episodes , Kyle and the other students were in the third grade following which they have been in the fourth grade . He lives in South Park with his father Gerald , a lawyer , and his overprotective mother Sheila , a housewife who fits the mold of a Jewish mother stereotype . Gerald and Sheila have been referred to as Polish Jews , and they mutually share a strong devotion to their Jewish religion , while expressing deep concern during the multiple times Kyle 's faith in Judaism becomes enervated . Kyle has a younger brother named Ike , who Kyle learns was adopted and originally from Canada in the episode Ike 's Wee Wee . 
 Gerald often attempts to teach Kyle important morals . Although his mother 's outspoken , manipulative nature usually overwhelms Kyle , he tends to show that he truly loves her , and takes offense to any insult Cartman may offer about her . Although he engages in the reckless act of punting Ike like a football , Kyle shows concern for his brother 's well @-@ being . He was initially reluctant to embrace Ike as his brother upon learning that Ike was adopted , but Ike 's genuine affection for his older brother persuaded Kyle to love him in return , and regard him as " true family " . 
 Kyle is modeled after Stone , while Stan is modeled after Parker . Kyle and Stan are best friends , and their relationship , which is intended to reflect the real @-@ life friendship between Parker and Stone , is a common topic throughout the series . The two do have their disagreements , but always reconcile without any long @-@ term damage to their friendship . The show 's official website defines Kyle 's role amongst his friends as " the smart one " . He often provides a sober thought to plans or ideas made by the other boys , and explains a moral outlook while drawing upon his vast knowledge and intelligence . He tends to offer reasonable or scientific explanations both to situations most others view as supernatural in nature , and in opposition of propaganda dispensed by Cartman . 
 Several episodes focus on Kyle and his religion , and being the lone Jew has resulted in an enmity with the Antisemitic Cartman that has become significantly more pronounced as the series progresses . Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to the one shared by Archie Bunker and Michael <unk> on the 1970s sitcom All in the Family . Kyle makes cracks at Cartman 's weight and is horrified and disgusted with Cartman 's immorality , cruelty , bigotry , and greed . Their rivalry often elevates to the point where Kyle becomes so obsessed with beating Cartman at whatever he does , he sometimes neglects Stan and Kenny in the process . He has a tendency to make what he thinks are safe bets with Cartman , often losing these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished . Though he has claimed Kenny was not his friend , in order to avoid having to spend the night at his poverty @-@ stricken household , Kyle has professed a friendship with Kenny and shown genuine concern for Kenny 's health and safety . Kyle normally has the angrier reaction of yelling , " You bastards ! " following Stan 's exclamation of the popular catchphrase , " Oh my God , they killed Kenny " after one of Kenny 's trademark deaths . 
 Near the end of the production run of the show 's fifth season ( 2001 ) , Parker and Stone contemplated having an episode in which Kyle was killed off . The reasoning behind the idea was to genuinely surprise fans , and to allow an opportunity to provide a major role for Butters Stotch , a breakout character whose popularity was growing with the viewers and creators of the show . Parker and Stone initially chose Kyle because they deemed him as being too similar to Stan , in terms of personality . Instead , the character of Kenny was chosen , and he was seemingly killed off for good in the episode " Kenny Dies " . The duo claimed they grew tired of upholding the tradition of having Kenny die in each episode , and regarded the character as a " prop " . Nevertheless , Kenny returned from a year @-@ long absence in the season six ( 2002 ) finale " Red Sleigh Down " , and has remained a main character ever since . 
 In many episodes , Kyle draws upon his sense of social purpose and moral outrage , and reflects on the lessons he has learned during the course of an episode , with a speech that often begins " You know , I learned something today ... " . Kyle acknowledged this trend in the season five ( 2001 ) episode " Cartmanland " when he states that he often gives the speech each week in an attempt to " try and better myself " , and again in the season seven ( 2003 ) episode " Butt Out " where he repeatedly reminds his friends that they continuously allow potentially riotous events to occur , and are only able to defuse the situation by giving such a speech to the gathered townsfolk . 
 Kyle 's mother reveals in the episode Cherokee Hair Tampons that Kyle is diabetic – although whether this ' goes away ' once Kyle gets a kidney transplant is unexplained and has seemingly not been brought up since . There have been numerous occasions when Kyle has been ill or sick more often than his classmates , and there has been speculation that he may have a poor immune system .

 = = = Creation and design = = = 
 An unnamed precursor to Kyle first appeared in the first The Spirit of Christmas short , dubbed Jesus vs. Frosty , created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado . The character was composed of construction paper cutouts and animated using stop motion . When asked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends , Parker and Stone created another similarly @-@ animated The Spirit of Christmas short , dubbed Jesus vs. Santa . In this short , which was the first appearance of Kyle styled as he is in the series , he is given his first name . When developing the character , Parker recalled there being only one Jewish student in his entire hometown of Conifer , Colorado , and described her as being " the token Jewish person " . Stone , himself Jewish , also recalled his own experiences as a youth in a predominantly Christian neighborhood , and both he and Parker decided to incorporate these aspects into the character . Kyle next appeared on August 13 , 1997 , when South Park debuted on Comedy Central with the episode " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " . 
 From the show 's second episode , " Weight Gain 4000 " ( season one , 1997 ) , Kyle , like all other characters on the show , has been animated using computer software , though he is presented to give the impression that the show still utilizes its original technique . In keeping with the show 's animation style , Kyle is composed of simple geometrical shapes . He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand @-@ drawn characters ; his character is generally shown from only one angle , and his movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion . 
 Kyle is usually depicted wearing winter attire which consists of a bright green <unk> , a bright orange jacket , dark green pants , and lime @-@ green mittens / gloves . The rare instances in which he is shown without his cap , he has a bright red @-@ to @-@ auburn Jewfro . His hat and hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey , a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal ! The Musical . While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation , Stone now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection . The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools , and the pitch altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader . 
 = = = Personality and traits = = = 
 Like his friends , Kyle is foul @-@ mouthed as a means for Parker and Stone to display how they claim young boys really talk when they are alone . Parker notes that while Kyle is sometimes cynical and profane , there is an " underlying sweetness " to the character , and Time described Kyle and his friends as " sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence " . He is amused by bodily functions and toilet humor , and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip , a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show @-@ within @-@ the @-@ show revolve substantially around fart jokes . 
 Kyle often displays the highest moral standard of all the boys and is usually depicted as the most intelligent . When describing Kyle , Stone states that both he and the character are " reactionary " , and susceptible to irritability and impatience . In some instances , Kyle is the only child in his class to not initially indulge in a fad or fall victim to a ploy . This has resulted in both his eagerness to fit in , and his resentment and frustration . 
 As a Jew , Kyle often defends and shows pride in his religion and ancestry . He is nevertheless lonely in this regard , particularly around Christmas time , though he takes solace in anticipating the annual appearance of Mr. Hankey , an anthropomorphic piece of feces who emerges from the sewer to spread Christmas cheer . 
 A recurring plot element is the depiction of Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs . Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life @-@ threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million @-@ dollar inheritance , Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job . He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic . During both instances , he renounced his affiliation with Judaism , only to have his faith restored by events occurring at the end of an episode . After watching The Passion of the Christ , a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman 's anti @-@ Semitism was justified , and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus . Kyle 's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson , the film 's director , and perceives him to be a deranged masochist . 
 Kyle has a first cousin also named Kyle , whom he resents for being the embodiment of Jewish stereotypes and causing Kyle to question whether or not he was a self @-@ hating Jew . Kyle is hopelessly inept at choreographed dancing ; in the eyes of Cartman , he perpetuated the stereotype that " Jews have no rhythm " . His birthday is May 26 , the same day as Stone . Kyle was conceived in New Jersey . 
 = = Cultural impact = = 
 Kyle 's depiction on the show has drawn both praise and criticism from the Jewish community . Detractors of the character cite his own habit of eschewing common Jewish practices and reiterating negative stereotypes for comedic purposes . Supportive Jewish viewers commend the show for using Kyle to accurately portray what it is like for a young Jew to have to endure loneliness and bigotry as an ethnic and religious minority . One of the show 's more popular episodes , " The Passion of the Jew " ( season eight , 2004 ) , deals largely with Kyle 's religious anxiety . The episode was independently released on DVD along with two other religion @-@ themed episodes from the series . 
 Over the seasons Kyle has addressed topics such as brotherhood , excessive litigation , hate crime legislation , civil liberties , profanity in television , hybrid vehicle ownership , and the economy . In the season 10 ( 2006 ) episode " Cartoon Wars Part II " , Kyle expresses his opinions on censorship , and iterates Parker and Stone 's sentiments on the topic by telling a television executive " Either it 's all okay , or none of it is " in regard to whether any subject should remain off @-@ limits to satire . To Parker and Stone 's disappointment , the episode received more attention for its criticism of the show Family Guy than it did for Kyle 's proclamation . 
 Kyle 's opinions have been the subject of much critical analysis in the media and literary world . The book South Park and Philosophy : You Know , I Learned Something Today includes an essay in which Bridgewater State College philosophy professor William J. Devlin references the teachings of Socrates and Friedrich Nietzsche when describing Kyle 's role in the show . Essays in the books South Park and Philosophy : Bigger , Longer , and More Penetrating , Blame Canada ! South Park and Contemporary Culture , and Taking South Park Seriously have also analyzed Kyle 's perspectives within the framework of popular philosophical , theological , and political concepts . 
 = = In other media = = 
 Kyle had a major role in South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut , the full @-@ length film based on the series , and appeared on the film 's soundtrack singing the same musical numbers performed in the movie . As a tribute to the Dead Parrot sketch , a short that features Kyle as the owner of a shop to where Cartman attempts to return a dead Kenny aired during a 1999 BBC television special commemorating the 30th anniversary of Monty Python 's Flying Circus . Kyle also featured in the documentary film The Aristocrats , listening to Cartman tell his version of the film 's titular joke , and in the " The Gauntlet " , a short spoofing both Gladiator and Battlefield Earth which aired during the 2000 MTV Movie Awards . Stone performs as Kyle on tracks for Chef Aid : The South Park Album and Mr. Hankey 's Christmas Classics . 
 Kyle appears in five South Park @-@ related video games : In South Park , Kyle is controlled by the player through the first @-@ person shooter mode who attempts to ward off enemies from terrorizing the town of South Park . In South Park : Chef 's Luv Shack , a user has the option of playing as Kyle when participating in the game 's several " minigames " based on other popular arcade games . In the racing game South Park Rally , a user can race as Kyle against other players , selecting from a variety of vehicles . In South Park Let 's Go Tower Defense Play ! , Kyle can be selected as a playable character used to establish a tower defense against the game 's antagonists .

 = HMS Fearless ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Fearless was an F @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s . Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion , the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935 – 36 during the Abyssinia Crisis . During the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 1939 , she spent time in Spanish waters , enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict . Several months after the start of the war in September 1939 , Fearless helped to sink one submarine and sank another one in 1940 during the Norwegian Campaign . She was sent to Gibraltar in mid @-@ 1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on the Vichy French ships at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir and the bombardment of Genoa . Fearless helped to sink one final submarine in 1941 and escorted many Malta convoys in the Mediterranean before she was torpedoed by an Italian bomber and had to be scuttled on 23 July 1941 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The F @-@ class ships were repeats of the preceding E @-@ class . They displaced 1 @,@ 405 long tons ( 1 @,@ 428 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 940 long tons ( 1 @,@ 970 t ) at deep load . The ships had an overall length of 329 feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet 3 inches ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam provided by three Admiralty three @-@ drum boilers . The turbines developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 35 @.@ 5 knots ( 65 @.@ 7 km / h ; 40 @.@ 9 mph ) . Fearless carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 6 @,@ 350 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 760 km ; 7 @,@ 310 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ships ' complement was 145 officers and ratings . 
 The ships mounted four 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) Mark IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' in sequence from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . The F class was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 38 shortly after the war began . All of her sister ships had their rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun by April 1941 , but she still had both sets of torpedo tube by that date and was probably not rearmed before her loss a few months later . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Fearless was ordered on 17 March 1933 from Cammell Laird and was laid down at their Birkenhead shipyard on 17 July , launched on 12 May 1934 , and completed on 19 December 1934 . The ship cost 245 @,@ 728 pounds , excluding government @-@ furnished equipment like the armament . Fearless was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla ( DF ) of the Home Fleet , but she was detached to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet during the Second Italo @-@ Abyssinian War from March to July 1936 . The ship enforced the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non @-@ Intervention Committee from November 1936 to March 1937 . During this time , Fearless escorted the elderly liner SS Habana , full of refugee children , from the Basque Country to Saint @-@ Jean @-@ de @-@ Luz , France . She returned to Gibraltar for three @-@ month detachments in August 1937 , January 1938 and January 1939 . The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939 , five months before the outbreak of World War II . Fearless remained assigned to it until May 1940 , escorting the larger ships of the fleet . 
 After a pair of fishing trawlers were sunk by a submarine off the Hebrides after the start of World War II in September 1939 , the 6th and 8th DFs were ordered to sweep the area on 19 September . The following day , Fearless and three of her sister ships sank the German submarine U @-@ 27 and then resumed their normal escort duties . At the end of March 1940 , Fearless and the destroyer Hostile were assigned to screen the light cruiser Birmingham as she searched for German fishing ships off the Norwegian coast . Birmingham and her consorts were ordered to join the covering force for Operation Wilfred , an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany , on the evening of 7 April , but they were delayed by the need to transfer prize crews to several captured trawlers and head seas . 
 A week later , she was escorting the battleship Valiant which was covering Convoy <unk> , the first troop convoy to Norway , as the Allies began to execute Plan R 4 after the German invasion on 9 April . The convoy entered the <unk> on the morning of 15 April en route to make their landings at Harstad , but paused there after reports of a German submarine on the surface inside the <unk> were received . Fearless , the destroyer Brazen , and the trawler Amethyst were ordered into the <unk> to investigate . Fearless 's ASDIC found a submarine and the ship dropped five depth charges near U @-@ 49 . The submarine commander , Lieutenant ( Kapitänleutnant ) Curt von Gossler , panicked and ordered his crew to surface and scuttle the boat . <unk> fire from Fearless discouraged von Gossler from properly disposing of his secret documents and a boat from Brazen was able to retrieve many of them , including a map showing the location of all U @-@ boats in Norwegian waters . Valiant , Fearless , Brazen and the destroyer Griffin were ordered to return to Scapa Flow that evening . 
 Beginning on 23 April , the ship was one of the escorts for the aircraft carriers Ark Royal and Glorious as they conducted air operations off the coast of Norway in support of Allied operations ashore . Fearless was detached to refuel at Sullom Voe on the 28th and rejoined the screen two days later . The ship was under repair from 15 May to 10 June at Middlesbrough . A week later , she was escorting the battlecruiser Hood and Ark Royal , together with her sisters Faulknor and Foxhound and the destroyer Escapade , from Scapa Flow to Gibraltar where they would form Force H.

 On 3 July she took part in the attack on the French Fleet at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir ( Operation Catapult ) . A month later the ship escorted Force H during Operation Hurry , a mission to fly off fighter aircraft for Malta and conduct an airstrike on Cagliari on 2 August . Two days later , while returning to the UK , Fearless collided with the trawler Flying Wing and was repaired at the Barclay Curle shipyard in Scotstoun between 10 August and 11 October . On 30 October she was involved in another collision with SS Lanark at Greenock that fractured her stern . More repairs followed at Troon , and Fearless did not rejoin Force H at Gibraltar until 18 January 1941 . 
 On 31 January , Force H departed Gibraltar to carry out Operation Picket , an unsuccessful night torpedo attack by eight of Ark Royal 's Fairey Swordfish on the Tirso Dam in Sardinia . The British ships returned to Gibraltar on 4 February and began preparing for Operation Grog , a naval bombardment of Genoa , that was successfully carried out five days later . At the end of March , together with the light cruiser HMS Sheffield and three other destroyers , the ship attempted to intercept a Vichy French convoy that included the freighter SS Bangkok , supposedly laden with 3 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 953 long tons ; 3 @,@ 307 short tons ) of rubber , which had already been unloaded . Fearless was ordered to board and capture Bangkok , but she was thwarted by gunfire from a coast @-@ defence battery off the port of Nemours , Algeria . A few days later , Fearless and four other destroyers escorted Sheffield , the battlecruiser Renown , and Ark Royal in Operation Winch , which delivered 12 Hurricane fighters to Malta . 
 In early May she was part of the destroyer screen with five other destroyers for the battleship Queen Elizabeth , and the light cruisers Naiad , Fiji and Gloucester which were joining the Mediterranean Fleet . This was part of Operation Tiger which included a supply convoy taking tanks to the Middle East and the transfer of warships . Fearless and her sisters had their Two @-@ Speed Destroyer Sweep ( TSDS ) minesweeping gear rigged to allow them to serve as a fast minesweepers en route to Malta . Despite this , one merchant ship was sunk by mines and another damaged . The ship escorted another flying @-@ off mission to Malta on 14 June ; two days later , after German blockade runners reached France , Force H sortied into the Atlantic on a failed search for more blockade runners . Together with her sisters Faulknor , Foresight , Forester and Foxhound , Fearless helped to sink U @-@ 138 on 18 June . Four days later , the 8th DF was tasked to intercept a German supply ship spotted heading towards the French coast . The next day they intercepted MS <unk> which was scuttled by her crew upon the approach of the British ships . They rescued 78 British POWs taken from ships sunk by German raiders and the crew . 
 Another Malta convoy ( Operation Substance ) was conducted in mid @-@ July , heavily escorted by Force H and elements of the Home Fleet . Fearless was torpedoed by an Italian Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.79 bomber at 09 : 45 on 23 July . The detonation killed 27 and wounded 11 of her crew , set the aft oil tank on fire , and knocked out all power and the port propeller shaft . Forester closed to render assistance , but the ship could not be saved under the circumstances . Her crew were taken off by her sister @-@ ship , which then sank the wrecked and burning ship with torpedoes at 10 : 57 , about 50 nmi ( 93 km ; 58 mi ) north @-@ north @-@ east of Bône , Algeria , in position 37 ° 40 ′ N 08 ° 20 ′ E.

 = Maryland Route 30 = 
 Maryland Route 30 ( MD 30 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . Known for most of its length as Hanover Pike , the highway runs 19 @.@ 16 miles ( 30 @.@ 84 km ) from MD 140 in Reisterstown north to the Pennsylvania state line near Melrose , where the highway continues as Pennsylvania Route 94 ( PA 94 ) . MD 30 is a major , two @-@ lane regional highway in western Baltimore County and northeastern Carroll County . Locally , the highway serves the towns of Manchester and Hampstead ; the latter town is bypassed by the highway but served by a business route . Regionally , MD 30 connects Reisterstown and Baltimore with Hanover , Pennsylvania . 
 MD 30 originated in the colonial era as part of a wagon road connecting the fledgling port of Baltimore with the new settlement that was to become Hanover . This highway was improved as a turnpike in the 19th century . MD 30 was constructed as a state road by the Maryland State Roads Commission in the late 1910s and early 1920s , and it became one of the original state @-@ numbered highways in 1927 . The state highway was relocated and widened near Reisterstown in the late 1930s and along the rest of its route in the early 1950s . The Hampstead Bypass was planned as early as the 1960s to ameliorate the increasing congestion along the MD 30 corridor that was only exacerbated when I @-@ 795 was completed to Reisterstown in the late 1980s . However , the construction of the bypass was continually delayed due to environmental issues and politics . The bypass was finally constructed between 2006 and 2009 ; the old highway through Hampstead became MD 30 Business . A MD 30 bypass of Manchester has also been discussed since the 1960s , but the Maryland State Highway Administration ( MDSHA ) has no plans to construct the new highway in the foreseeable future . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MD 30 begins within the Reisterstown Historic District at an intersection with MD 140 , which heads south as Main Street and northwest as Westminster Pike . The state highway heads north as two @-@ lane Hanover Pike through a residential area to a four @-@ way intersection with MD 128 ( Butler Road ) and unsigned MD 795 , a connector between MD 30 and the northern terminus of I @-@ 795 ( Northwest Expressway ) at MD 140 that serves as a bypass of Reisterstown for MD 30 traffic . As the highway leaves Reisterstown , Old Hanover Pike splits to the northeast and MD 30 crosses over the Maryland Midland Railway . Old Hanover Pike reconnects with the state highway where the highway briefly parallels CSX 's Hanover Subdivision and passes to the east of the Montrose Mansion and Chapel . At the hamlet of <unk> , the old road splits northeast again to follow the railroad through the village of Boring . The railroad and old road return to MD 30 again just north of the state highway 's intersection with MD 91 ( Emory Road ) . MD 30 parallels the railroad through the community of <unk> , which is also known as Arcadia , before crossing the Baltimore – Carroll county line . 
 Shortly after entering Carroll County , MD 30 curves northwest and meets the southern end of MD 30 Business ( Hanover Pike ) and Phillips Drive at a roundabout . While the business route heads north through the center of Hampstead , MD 30 passes to the west of the town on the Hampstead Bypass , which has two lanes but expands to a three- or four @-@ lane divided highway for short stretches on either side of its roundabouts . The state highway passes under <unk> Road and over Shiloh Road before meeting MD 482 ( Hampstead – Mexico Road ) at a roundabout . MD 30 reunites with the northern end of MD 30 Business at a roundabout in the community of Greenmount . The state highway , once again named Hanover Pike , has a short four @-@ lane divided section through a commercial area before reducing to two lanes . 
 MD 30 enters the town of Manchester as Main Street as the highway passes by Manchester Valley High School . In the center of town , the highway intersects Westminster Street and York Street ; along the latter street is Charlotte 's Quest Nature Center . MD 30 meets the northern end of MD 27 ( Manchester Road ) on the northern edge of downtown and the southern end of MD 86 ( <unk> Road ) at the north town limit . There is no direct access from southbound MD 30 to northbound MD 86 ; that movement is made via Hallie Avenue , the next intersection to the south . MD 30 crosses Dug Hill Ridge just north of MD 86 and passes through the community of Melrose , where the highway intersects MD 496 ( <unk> Valley Road ) and Wentz Road . The state highway follows the upper reaches of the South Branch of Gunpowder Falls through a ridge to the river 's source before reaching its northern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line . The highway continues as PA 94 ( Baltimore Pike ) through southwestern York County to Hanover . 
 MD 30 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length except for the short segment in Reisterstown south of MD 128 and MD 795 ; that short segment is a National Highway System principal arterial . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Wagon road to state highway = = = 
 The first road along the corridor of MD 30 was a wagon road cut along an existing Indian trail in 1736 and 1737 to connect the Conewago Settlement , which later became Hanover , with Baltimore Town , which served as a much closer port for farmers and merchants in York County and Adams County , Pennsylvania , than Philadelphia . This road became known as the Conewago Road , Pack Horse Road , or the Wheelbarrow Road , the last due to the namesake implements being used to haul stones to widen the road by order of Maryland in 1793 . The highway became a toll road with the 1805 incorporation of the Baltimore and Reisterstown Turnpike Company , which operated between the two towns and split into Westminster and Hanover branches in Reisterstown . The latter branch became known as the Hanover Turnpike or the Baltimore and Hanover Turnpike and had ceased to collect tolls by 1899 . 
 Work on modern MD 30 began in 1918 with the construction of a 39 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) -wide street through Reisterstown and a 15 @-@ to @-@ 16 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 to 4 @.@ 9 m ) concrete road north from Reisterstown to <unk> . By 1921 , the whole length of future MD 30 was planned for improvement and the concrete road had been extended to the southern end of Hampstead ; in addition , Main Street in Manchester had been paved in concrete . Main Street in Hampstead was rebuilt as a concrete street and the remainder of the highway to the Pennsylvania line , excluding Main Street in Manchester , was completed as a macadam road in 1923 . MD 30 was one of the original state @-@ numbered highways marked in 1927 . 
 By 1934 , the entire length of MD 30 was proposed to be widened from its existing width of 15 to 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 to 4 @.@ 9 m ) to 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) . The only major relocation of MD 30 in the 20th century was the elimination of a grade crossing at the Western Maryland Railway ( now the Maryland Midland Railway ) at Glen Morris . The present bridge over the railroad was completed in 1936 , but the relocated highway , which replaced what is now Old Hanover Road to the east , was not placed under construction until 1938 and did not open until 1939 . MD 30 was widened from Hampstead south to the Baltimore – Carroll county line in 1938 with a pair of 3 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) -wide macadam shoulders , expanding the road 's width to 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) . MD 30 was relocated in a few spots , widened , and resurfaced from the county line north to Manchester in 1950 , from the county line south to the north end of the Glen Morris relocation in 1951 and 1952 , and from Manchester north to the Pennsylvania state line in 1953 and 1954 . 
 = = = Bypasses of Hampstead and Manchester = = = 
 A MD 30 bypass of Hampstead has been contemplated since the 1940s and planned since at least 1960 . The heavy traffic along the highway consisted of three types of highway users : local traffic made up of people who had moved to Hampstead or Manchester for the municipalities ' small @-@ town charm ; regional traffic comprising people who had moved to Pennsylvania for cheaper housing and lower taxes but continued to work in the Baltimore area ; and truck traffic serving local industry and making connections between Baltimore and Hanover . The increase in congestion on MD 30 accelerated with the completion of I @-@ 795 in 1987 . By the early 1990s , it took as long as 15 minutes for motorists to pass through each of the towns during rush hour ; an average of 20 @,@ 000 to 25 @,@ 000 motorists used the highway through Hampstead each day by 2001 . Progress toward construction of the bypass was continually delayed . The bypass was removed from MDSHA plans by 1979 . The Hampstead Bypass had returned to state plans by 1990 , when engineering and design work was underway and construction was planned to begin in 1992 . However , in 1991 , the bypass was shelved for six years for lack of funding . 
 There have been several causes of the continual postponement of the bypass . In 1991 , heavy groundwater contamination by industrial chemicals was discovered near the southern end of the proposed route , then 5 @.@ 8 miles ( 9 @.@ 3 km ) long , at a Black & Decker factory and near the northern end of the planned route at a shopping center . The bypass route changed again in 1994 when a population of bog turtles was discovered along the bypass route . The bog turtle has been on the Maryland endangered species list since 1972 and was added to the " threatened " list under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1997 . In 1998 , the route of the Hampstead Bypass changed a third time when the bog turtle habitat was found to be larger than previously discovered . Delays were also ascribed to the state 's political climate . Carroll County is a heavily Republican county in a heavily Democratic state , and until the election of Bob Ehrlich as governor in 2002 , the state had not had a Republican governor since Spiro Agnew left office in 1969 . Local sentiment was that the county was relatively neglected and did not get its fair share of state highway funding for close to 40 years . 
 By 1997 , the start of construction of the Hampstead Bypass was proposed for three to four years in the future ; at that time , most of the engineering phase was complete but most of the highway right @-@ of @-@ way had yet to be purchased . The three @-@ year timeframe was again put forth in 2001 . Finally , in 2004 , officials announced that the bypass would begin construction in autumn 2005 . Construction finally got underway in summer 2006 . <unk> Road 's bridge over the bypass and the highway 's bridges over Shiloh Road and Indian Run were completed in 2007 . The roundabouts at MD 482 and at the southern end of the bypass opened , without connections to the under @-@ construction bypass , in April and May of 2009 , respectively . The roundabout at the northern end of the bypass opened when the bypass opened to traffic on August 6 , 2009 . To minimize disruption to the bog turtle habitat , MDSHA installed tunnels under the bypass for the turtles to use and employed goats to consume invasive species in the habitat area near the bypass rather than remove them with mechanical mowers . Old MD 30 through the center of Hampstead was redesignated MD 30 Business when the bypass opened . 
 Since as early as 1967 , local officials have discussed building a Manchester bypass , either as a separate project or as part of a road bypassing both Hampstead and Manchester . However , by the mid @-@ 1970s , the town of Manchester decided it did not want the bypass . The bypass was planned to pass to the west of Manchester , but the town allowed a residential subdivision to be built along the bypass route . The planned bypass route was eventually changed to be east of town . After two decades of disagreement by the town and county over the path of the bypass , in 1993 the bypass was placed in the town 's master plan . However , state support for the Manchester bypass was scrapped in 1998 by Smart Growth proponent and governor Parris Glendening , who said the bypass would promote suburban sprawl . The Manchester Bypass is neither in the Maryland Department of Transportation 's Consolidated Transportation Program for 2012 to 2017 nor in MDSHA 's 2011 Highway Needs Inventory for the next 20 years .

 Maryland Route 30 Business is a 4 @.@ 00 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 44 km ) business route of MD 30 through Hampstead . The business route begins at a four @-@ leg roundabout with MD 30 , which heads south as Hanover Pike and northwest as the Hampstead Bypass , and Phillips Drive . MD 30 Business parallels CSX 's Hanover Subdivision through an industrial area that contains the headquarters of <unk> . A. Bank <unk> . The highway 's name changes from Hanover Pike to Main Street as it enters the town of Hampstead at an oblique grade crossing of the railroad . At the south end of downtown , MD 30 Business intersects the western ends of MD 88 ( Lower <unk> Road ) and MD 833 ( Black Rock Road ) . Gill Avenue is used to access eastbound MD 833 and the historic Hampstead School . North of downtown , the highway meets the eastern end of MD 482 ( Hampstead – Mexico Road ) and has another acute grade crossing of the Hanover Subdivision before exiting the town and becoming Hanover Pike again . In the community of Greenmount , the railroad veers away to the northeast and MD 30 Business veers northwest to its northern terminus at a three @-@ leg roundabout with MD 30 , which heads southwest as the Hampstead Bypass and north as Hanover Pike toward Manchester . The highway is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from the southern junction with MD 30 to MD 88 . MD 30 Business was created on August 6 , 2009 , along the former alignment of MD 30 through the town after MD 30 was relocated onto the Hampstead Bypass . Now that MD 30 has bypassed Hampstead , a streetscape project is planned to rebuild Main Street through town starting in 2014 or 2015 .

 The Complete Studio Albums ( 1983 – 2008 ) is a box set by American singer @-@ songwriter Madonna . It was released by Warner Bros. Records on March 26 , 2012 , to coincide with the release of her twelfth studio album , MDNA . The eleven @-@ disc box set was released in Europe and Japan , and included all of Madonna 's studio albums from the years 1983 to 2008 . The album artwork consisted of a collage of the album covers , housed in a gold box , it also included a Parental Advisory sticker due to the inclusion of the albums Erotica ( 1992 ) and American Life ( 2003 ) . On the same date , Warner Bros. released and reprinted another box set titled Madonna : Original Album Series which included five discs . 
 After its release , The Complete Studio Albums ( 1983 – 2008 ) received mixed reception from reviewers , who complimented the overall packaging of the box set , but hoped that the record label would have included Madonna 's other songs also . The box set charted in multiple nations including Croatia , Finland , France , Italy , Korea , Mexico , Netherlands , Spain , Sweden and United Kingdom . It entered the top @-@ ten of the Japanese Oricon album chart . The same week , MDNA was also present in the top @-@ ten , making Madonna the first female artist from a Western country to have two albums in the chart 's top @-@ ten .

 On March 6 , 2012 , Madonna 's official website announced that her former record company , Warner Bros. Records ( 1982 – 2009 ) , was to release and reprint the eleven @-@ disc box set . It was released to coincide and on the same date as the 2012 studio album MDNA in the United States . The set includes every previous studio album Madonna had released ; the remastered versions of Madonna ( 1983 ) , Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) and True Blue ( 1986 ) , plus the original versions of Like a Prayer ( 1989 ) , Erotica ( 1992 ) , Bedtime Stories ( 1994 ) , Ray of Light ( 1998 ) , Music ( 2000 ) , American Life ( 2003 ) , Confessions on a Dance Floor ( 2005 ) and Hard Candy ( 2008 ) with each disc housed in a cardboard sleeve . To complement the release of the box set , iTunes sold every Madonna studio album digitally for £ 3 @.@ 95 for a limited time in the UK . On the same day as its release , Warner Bros. released another box set Madonna : Original Album Series which included five discs ; the remastered version of True Blue , Like a Prayer , Ray of Light , Music and Confessions on a Dance Floor . 
 The box set also carries the logos for her other former record companies ; Sire Records ( 1982 – 1995 ) and Maverick Records ( 1992 – 2004 ) . It is her third greatest hits box set to be released after The Royal Box ( 1991 ) which was a limited edition of The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) and CD Single Collection ( 1996 ) which was released exclusively in Japan and included forty 3 " CD singles , from " Burning Up " ( 1983 ) to " One More Chance " ( 1996 ) , housed in a deluxe black glossy box .

In Japan it sold 13 @,@ 000 copies and debuted at number nine ( and MDNA at number four ) making Madonna the first international female artist in Japanese chart history to have two albums in the top ten simultaneously and the first international artist in 20 years to achieve such feat , after Bruce Springsteen , who occupied two simultaneous top @-@ ten albums in 1992 with Human Touch and Lucky Town . With this feat , Madonna has accumulated 22 top @-@ ten albums in Japan , more than any other international artist . On the South Korean International chart , it debuted and peaked at number 81 , selling around 200 copies . It was certified gold in Poland by the Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry ( ZPAV ) for shipment of 10 @,@ 000 copies of the box set .

 Mike Diver from the BBC News gave the box set a positive review , commenting that " this is pop history , a document of the most powerful female force in the music industry as she began her ascent , achieved superstar status , overcame a couple of hiccups , and ultimately landed in the 00s as every fledgling pop idol 's ultimate mother figure . " He also mentioned the absence of tracks " Into the Groove " ( only available on the 1985 reissue of Like a Virgin ) , " Vogue " ( from 1990 's I 'm Breathless soundtrack ) and " Justify My Love " ( from 1990 's The Immaculate Collection ) may disappoint some fans . Robin Murray from Clash noted that while it traced " the evolution of a pop phenomenon " , he felt it needed bonus materials . Andy Kellman from AllMusic was more ambivalent in his reception of the box set , stating that the release is more suitable for " voracious newcomers than longtime followers " . 
 Describing the packaging , Kellman noted that it " was sharp but not elaborate — a clamshell box with each disc packaged in a paper LP @-@ replica sleeve . While the box is a convenient and reasonably priced way to obtain most of Madonna 's releases , an investment of that scope should entail all the stray hits from the same era . This really could have used a 12th disc " , for adding all the other songs released by Madonna . The BBC described the packaging as a " no @-@ frills affair — CDs are housed in cardboard sleeves that won 't stand up to house @-@ party punishment " Clash commented on the packaging more favorably , describing it as " fairly lavish " .

 = Endgame tablebase = 
 An endgame tablebase is a computerized database that contains precalculated exhaustive analysis of chess endgame positions . It is typically used by a computer chess engine during play , or by a human or computer that is retrospectively analysing a game that has already been played . 
 The tablebase contains the game @-@ theoretical value ( win , loss , or draw ) of each possible move in each possible position , and how many moves it would take to achieve that result with perfect play . Thus , the tablebase acts as an oracle , always providing the optimal moves . Typically the database records each possible position with certain pieces remaining on the board , and the best moves with White to move and with Black to move . 
 Tablebases are generated by retrograde analysis , working backwards from a checkmated position . By 2005 , all chess positions with up to six pieces ( including the two kings ) had been solved . By August 2012 , tablebases had solved chess for every position with up to seven pieces ( the positions with a lone king versus a king and five pieces were omitted because they were considered uninteresting ) . 
 The solutions have profoundly advanced the chess community 's understanding of endgame theory . Some positions which humans had analyzed as draws were proven to be winnable ; the tablebase analysis could find a mate in more than five hundred moves , far beyond the horizon of humans , and beyond the capability of a computer during play . For this reason , they have also called into question the 50 move rule since many positions are now seen to exist that are a win for one side but would be drawn because of the 50 move rule . Tablebases have enhanced competitive play and facilitated the composition of endgame studies . They provide a powerful analytical tool . 
 While endgame tablebases for other board games like checkers , chess variants or Nine Men 's Morris exist , when a game is not specified , it is assumed to be chess . 
 = = Background = = 
 Physical limitations of computer hardware aside , in principle it is possible to solve any game under the condition that the complete state is known and there is no random chance . Strong solutions , i.e. algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position , are known for some simple games such as Tic Tac Toe / <unk> and crosses ( draw with perfect play ) and Connect Four ( first player wins ) . Weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games , such as checkers ( with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw , but it is not known for every position created by less @-@ than @-@ perfect play what the perfect next move would be ) . Other games , such as chess ( from the starting position ) and Go , have not been solved because their game complexity is too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions . To reduce the game complexity , researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board , or the number of pieces , or both . 
 Computer chess is one of the oldest domains of artificial intelligence , having begun in the early 1930s . Claude Shannon proposed formal criteria for evaluating chess moves in 1949 . In 1951 , Alan Turing designed a primitive chess playing program , which assigned values for material and mobility ; the program " played " chess based on Turing 's manual calculations . However , even as competent chess programs began to develop , they exhibited a glaring weakness in playing the endgame . Programmers added specific heuristics for the endgame – for example , the king should move to the center of the board . However , a more comprehensive solution was needed . 
 In 1965 , Richard Bellman proposed the creation of a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis . Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board , the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated . Thus , a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand . It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move . 
 In 1970 , Thomas <unk> published a doctoral thesis with analysis of the following classes of endgame : <unk> , <unk> , KPK , KQKR , <unk> , and <unk> . In 1977 Thompson 's KQKR database was used in a match versus Grandmaster Walter Browne . 
 Ken Thompson and others helped extend tablebases to cover all four- and five @-@ piece endgames , including in particular KBBKN , <unk> , and <unk> . Lewis Stiller published a thesis with research on some six @-@ piece tablebase endgames in 1995 . 
 More recent contributors have included the following people : 
 Eugene Nalimov , after whom the popular Nalimov tablebases are named ; 
 Eiko <unk> , who has adapted the tablebase concept to a program called " Freezer " ( see below ) ; 
 Guy Haworth , an academic at the University of Reading , who has published extensively in the <unk> Journal and elsewhere ; 
 Marc Bourzutschky and Yakov Konoval , who have collaborated to analyze endgames with seven pieces on the board ; 
 Peter Karrer , who constructed a specialized seven @-@ piece tablebase ( <unk> ) for the endgame of the Kasparov versus The World online match ; 
 Vladimir <unk> and Victor Zakharov from Moscow State University , who completed 4 + 3 DTM @-@ tablebases ( 525 endings including <unk> ) in July 2012 . The tablebases are named Lomonosov tablebases . The next set of 5 + 2 DTM @-@ tablebases ( 350 endings including <unk> ) was completed during August 2012 . The high speed of generating the tablebases was because of using a supercomputer named Lomonosov ( <unk> ) . The size of all tablebases up to seven @-@ man is about 140 TB . 
 The tablebases of all endgames with up to six pieces are available for free download , and may also be queried using web interfaces ( see the external links below ) . Nalimov tablebase requires more than one terabyte of storage space . 
 = = Generating tablebases = = 
 = = = Metrics : Depth to conversion and depth to mate = = = 
 Before creating a tablebase , a programmer must choose a metric of optimality – in other words , he must define at what point a player has " won " the game . Every position can be defined by its distance ( i.e. the number of moves ) from the desired endpoint . Two metrics are generally used : 
 Depth to mate ( DTM ) . A checkmate is the only way to win a game . 
 Depth to conversion ( DTC ) . The stronger side can also win by capturing material , thus converting to a simpler endgame . For example , in KQKR , conversion occurs when White captures the Black rook . 
 Haworth has discussed two other metrics , namely " depth to zeroing @-@ move " ( DTZ ) and " depth by the rule " ( <unk> ) . A zeroing @-@ move is a move which resets the move count to zero under the fifty @-@ move rule , i.e. mate , a capture , or a pawn move . These metrics support the fifty @-@ move rule , but <unk> tablebases have not yet been computed . As of April 1 , 2013 , 5- and 6 @-@ man DTZ tablebases have been generated by Ronald de Man ; both tablebases and generation code are available for download . 
 The difference between DTC and DTM can be understood by analyzing the diagram at right . How White should proceed depends on which metric is used . 
 According to the DTC metric , White should capture the rook because that leads immediately to a position which will certainly win ( DTC 
 = 1 ) , but it will take two more moves actually to checkmate ( DTM = 
 3 ) . In contrast according to the DTM metric , White mates in two moves , so DTM 
 = DTC = 
 2 . 
 This difference is typical of many endgames . Usually DTC is smaller than DTM , but the DTM metric leads to the quickest checkmate . Exceptions occur where the weaker side has only a king , and in the unusual endgame of two knights versus one pawn ; then DTC = DTM because either there is no defending material to capture or capturing the material does no good . ( Indeed , capturing the defending pawn in the latter endgame results in a draw . ) 
 = = = Step 1 : Generating all possible positions = = = 
 Once a metric is chosen , the first step is to generate all the positions with a given material . For example , to generate a DTM tablebase for the endgame of king and queen versus king ( <unk> ) , the computer must describe approximately 40 @,@ 000 unique legal positions . 
 Levy and Newborn explain that the number 40 @,@ 000 derives from a symmetry argument . The Black king can be placed on any of ten squares : a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 , b2 , c2 , d2 , c3 , d3 , and d4 ( see diagram ) . On any other square , its position can be considered equivalent by symmetry of rotation or reflection . Thus , there is no difference whether a Black king in a corner resides on a1 , a8 , h8 , or h1 . Multiply this number of 10 by at most 60 ( legal remaining ) squares for placing the White king and then by at most 62 squares for the White queen . The product 10 × 60 × 62 
 = 37 @,@ 200 . Several hundred of these positions are illegal , impossible , or symmetrical reflections of each other , so the actual number is somewhat smaller . 
 For each position , the tablebase evaluates the situation separately for White @-@ to @-@ move and Black @-@ to @-@ move . Assuming that White has the queen , almost all the positions are White wins , with checkmate forced in not more than ten moves . Some positions are draws because of stalemate or the unavoidable loss of the queen . 
 Each additional piece added to a pawnless endgame multiplies the number of unique positions by about a factor of sixty which is the approximate number of squares not already occupied by other pieces . 
 <unk> with one or more pawns increase the complexity because the symmetry argument is reduced . Since pawns can move forward but not sideways , rotation and vertical reflection of the board produces a fundamental change in the nature of the position . The best calculation of symmetry is achieved by limiting one pawn to 24 squares in the rectangle a2 @-@ a7 @-@ d7 @-@ d2 . All other pieces and pawns may be located in any of the 64 squares with respect to the pawn . Thus , an endgame with pawns has a complexity of 24 / 10 = 
 2 @.@ 4 times a pawnless endgame with the same number of pieces . 
 = = = Step 2 : Evaluating positions using retrograde analysis = = = 
 Tim Krabbé explains the process of generating a tablebase as follows : 
 " The idea is that a database is made with all possible positions with a given material [ note : as in the preceding section ] . Then a <unk> is made of all positions where Black is mated . Then one where White can give mate . Then one where Black cannot stop White giving mate next move . Then one where White can always reach a position where Black cannot stop him from giving mate next move . And so on , always a ply further away from mate until all positions that are thus connected to mate have been found . Then all of these positions are linked back to mate by the shortest path through the database . That means that , apart from ' equi @-@ optimal ' moves , all the moves in such a path are perfect : White 's move always leads to the quickest mate , Black 's move always leads to the slowest mate . " 
 The retrograde analysis is only necessary from the checkmated positions . Other positions need not be worked from because every position that is not reached from a checkmated position is a draw . 
 Figure 1 illustrates the idea of retrograde analysis . White mates in two moves with 1 . Kc6 , leading to the position in Figure 2 . Then if 1 ... Kb8 2 . <unk> mate , and if 1 ... Kd8 2 . Qd7 mate ( Figure 3 ) . 
 Figure 3 , before White 's second move , is defined as " mate in one ply . " Figure 2 , after White 's first move , is " mate in two ply , " regardless of how Black plays . Finally , the initial position in Figure 1 is " mate in three ply " ( i.e. , two moves ) because it leads directly to Figure 2 , which is already defined as " mate in two ply . " This process , which links a current position to another position that could have existed one ply earlier , can continue indefinitely . 
 Each position is evaluated as a win or loss in a certain number of moves . At the end of the retrograde analysis , positions which are not designated as wins or losses are necessarily draws . 
 = = = Step 3 : Verification = = = 
 After the tablebase has been generated , and every position has been evaluated , the result must be verified independently . The purpose is to check the self @-@ consistency of the tablebase results . 
 For example , in Figure 1 above , the verification program sees the evaluation " mate in three ply ( Kc6 ) . " It then looks at the position in Figure 2 , after Kc6 , and sees the evaluation " mate in two ply . " These two evaluations are consistent with each other . If the evaluation of Figure 2 were anything else , it would be inconsistent with Figure 1 , so the tablebase would need to be corrected . 
 = = = Captures , pawn promotion , and special moves = = = 
 A four @-@ piece tablebase must rely on three @-@ piece tablebases that could result if one piece is captured . Similarly , a tablebase containing a pawn must be able to rely on other tablebases that deal with the new set of material after pawn promotion to a queen or other piece . The retrograde analysis program must account for the possibility of a capture or pawn promotion on the previous move . 
 Tablebases assume that castling is not possible for two reasons . First , in practical endgames , this assumption is almost always correct . ( However , castling is allowed by convention in composed problems and studies . ) Second , if the king and rook are on their original squares , castling may or may not be allowed . Because of this ambiguity , it would be necessary to make separate evaluations for states in which castling is or is not possible . 
 The same ambiguity exists for the en passant capture , since the possibility of en passant depends on the opponent 's previous move . However , practical applications of en passant occur frequently in pawn endgames , so tablebases account for the possibility of en passant for positions where both sides have at least one pawn . 
 = = = Using a priori information = = = 
 According to the method described above , the tablebase must allow the possibility that a given piece might occupy any of the 64 squares . In some positions , it is possible to restrict the search space without affecting the result . This saves computational resources and enables searches which would otherwise be impossible . 
 An early analysis of this type was published in 1987 , in the endgame KRP ( a2 ) <unk> ( a3 ) , where the Black bishop moves on the dark squares ( see example position at right ) . In this position , we can make the following a priori assumptions : 
 1 . If a piece is captured , we can look up the resulting position in the corresponding tablebase with five pieces . For example , if the Black pawn is captured , look up the newly created position in <unk> . 
 2 . The White pawn stays on a2 ; capture moves are handled by the 1st rule . 
 3 . The Black pawn stays on a3 ; capture moves are handled by the 1st rule . 
 The result of this simplification is that , instead of searching for 48 * 47 = 2 @,@ 256 permutations for the pawns ' locations , there is only one permutation . Reducing the search space by a factor of 2 @,@ 256 facilitates a much quicker calculation . 
 <unk> has designed a commercial program called " Freezer , " which allows users to build new tablebases from existing Nalimov tablebases with a priori information . The program can produce a tablebase for positions with seven or more pieces with blocked pawns , even though tablebases for seven or more pieces are generally not available . 
 = = Applications = = 
 = = = Correspondence chess = = = 
 In correspondence chess , a player may consult a chess computer for assistance , provided that the etiquette of the competition allows this . A six @-@ piece tablebase ( <unk> ) was used to analyze the endgame that occurred in the correspondence game Kasparov versus The World . Players have also used tablebases to analyze endgames from over @-@ the @-@ board play after the game is over . 
 Competitive players need to know that tablebases ignore the fifty @-@ move rule . According to that rule , if fifty moves have passed without a capture or a pawn move , either player may claim a draw . FIDE changed the rules several times , starting in 1974 , to allow one hundred moves for endgames where fifty moves were insufficient to win . In 1988 , FIDE allowed seventy @-@ five moves for KBBKN , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> with the pawn on the seventh rank , because tablebases had uncovered positions in these endgames requiring more than fifty moves to win . In 1992 , FIDE canceled these exceptions and restored the fifty @-@ move rule to its original standing . Thus a tablebase may identify a position as won or lost , when it is in fact drawn by the fifty @-@ move rule . In 2013 , ICCF changed the rules for correspondence chess tournaments starting from 2014 ; a player may claim a win or draw based on six @-@ man tablebases . In this case the fifty @-@ move rule is not applied , and the number of moves to mate is not taken into consideration . 
 Haworth has designed a tablebase that produces results consistent with the fifty @-@ move rule . However most tablebases search for the theoretical limits of forced mate , even if it requires several hundred moves . 
 = = = Computer chess = = = 
 The knowledge contained in tablebases affords the computer a tremendous advantage in the endgame . Not only can computers play perfectly within an endgame , but they can simplify to a winning tablebase position from a more complicated endgame . For the latter purpose , some programs use " <unk> " which give the game @-@ theoretical value of positions without the number of moves until conversion or mate — that is , they only reveal whether the position is won , lost or draw . Sometimes even this data is compressed and the <unk> reveals only whether a position is won or not , making no difference between a lost and a drawn game . <unk> , for example , used by the Shredder program , are a type of <unk> which fits all three , four and five piece <unk> in 157 MB . This is a mere fraction of the 7 @.@ 05 GB that the Nalimov tablebases require . Some computer chess experts have observed practical drawbacks to the use of tablebases . In addition to ignoring the fifty @-@ move rule , a computer in a difficult position might avoid the losing side of a tablebase ending even if the opponent cannot practically win without himself knowing the tablebase . The adverse effect could be a premature resignation , or an inferior line of play that loses with less resistance than a play without tablebase might offer . 
 Another drawback is that tablebases require a lot of memory to store the many thousands of positions . The Nalimov tablebases , which use advanced compression techniques , require 7 @.@ 05 GB of hard disk space for all five @-@ piece endings . The six @-@ piece endings require approximately 1 @.@ 2 TB . It is estimated that seven @-@ piece tablebases will require between 50 and 200 TB of storage space . Some computers play better overall if their memory is devoted instead to the ordinary search and evaluation function . Modern engines analyze far enough ahead conventionally to handle the elementary endgames without needing tablebases ( i.e. without suffering from the horizon effect ) . It is only in more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine 's performance . 
 Syzygy tablebases were developed by Ronald de Man , released in April 2013 , in a form optimized for use by a chess program during search . This variety consists of two tables per endgame : a smaller WDL table ( win @-@ draw @-@ loss ) which contains knowledge of the 50 @-@ move rule , and a larger DTZ table ( distance to zero ply , i.e. pawn move or capture ) . The WDL tables were designed to be small enough to fit on a solid @-@ state drive for quick access during search , whereas the DTZ form is for use at the root position to choose the game @-@ theoretically quickest win instead of performing a search . Syzygy tablebases are available for all 5 piece endings and some 6 piece endings , and are now supported by many top engines , including Komodo 7 , Deep Fritz 14 , Houdini 4 , and <unk> 6 . 
 = = = Endgame theory = = = 
 In contexts where the fifty @-@ move rule may be ignored , tablebases have answered longstanding questions about whether certain combinations of material are wins or draws . The following interesting results have emerged : 
 KBBKN — Bernhard Horwitz and Josef Kling ( 1851 ) proposed that Black can draw by entering a defensive fortress , but tablebases demonstrated a general win , with maximum DTC 
 = 66 or 67 and maximum DTM = 
 78 . ( Also see pawnless chess endgame . ) 
 <unk> — Maximum DTC 
 = DTM = 
 115 moves . 
 <unk> — The knights win in 62 @.@ 5 percent of positions , with maximum DTM = 85 moves . 
 <unk> — Despite the equality of material , the player to move wins in 67 @.@ 74 % of positions . The maximum DTC is 92 , and the maximum DTM is 117 . In both this endgame and <unk> , the first player to check usually wins . 
 <unk> and KRBKNN — Friedrich <unk> had analyzed these two endgames in the 1900s . <unk> and KRBKNN are won for the strongest side in 78 % and 95 % of the cases , respectively . Stiller 's DTC tablebase revealed several lengthy wins in these endgames . The longest win in KRBKNN has a DTC of 223 and a DTM of 238 moves ( not shown ) . Even more amazing is the position at right , where White wins starting with 1 . Ke6 ! Stiller reported the DTC as 243 moves , and the DTM was later found to be 262 moves . 
 For some years , this position held the record for the longest computer @-@ generated forced mate . ( Otto <unk> had composed a " mate in 292 moves " problem in 1889 , albeit from an illegal starting position . ) However , in May 2006 , Bourzutschky and Konoval discovered a <unk> position with an astonishing DTC of 517 moves . This was more than twice as long as Stiller 's maximum , and almost 200 moves beyond the previous record of a 330 DTC for a position of <unk> _ 1001 . Bourzutschky wrote , " This was a big surprise for us and is a great tribute to the complexity of chess . " Later , a similar position was shown to have a DTM of 545 . 
 In August 2006 , Bourzutschky released preliminary results from his analysis of the following seven @-@ piece endgames : <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 Many positions are winnable although at first sight they appear to be non @-@ winnable . For example , this position is a win for Black in 154 moves ( during which the white pawn is liquidated after around eighty moves ) . 
 In this position the White pawn 's first move is at move 119 against optimal defense by Black . 
 = = = Endgame studies = = = 
 Since many composed endgame studies deal with positions that exist in tablebases , their soundness can be checked using the tablebases . Some studies have been cooked , i.e. proved unsound , by the tablebases . That can be either because the composer 's solution does not work , or else because there is an equally effective alternative that the composer did not consider . Another way tablebases cook studies is a change in the evaluation of an endgame . For instance , the endgame with a queen and bishop versus two rooks was thought to be a draw , but tablebases proved it to be a win for the queen and bishop , so almost all studies based on this endgame are unsound . 
 For example , Erik <unk> composed the study at right , with White to play and win . His intended main line was 1 . Ne3 Rxh2 2 . O @-@ O @-@ O # ! A tablebase discovered that 1 @.@ h4 also wins for White in 33 moves , even though Black can capture the pawn ( which is not the best move – in case of capturing the pawn black loses in 21 moves , while <unk> @-@ g2 loses in 32 moves ) . Incidentally , the tablebase does not recognize the composer 's solution because it includes castling . 
 While tablebases have cooked some studies , they have assisted in the creation of other studies . Composers can search tablebases for interesting positions , such as zugzwang , using a method called data mining . For all three- to five @-@ piece endgames and pawnless six @-@ piece endgames , a complete list of mutual <unk> has been tabulated and published . 
 There has been some controversy whether to allow endgame studies composed with tablebase assistance into composing tourneys . In 2003 , the endgame composer and expert John Roycroft summarized the debate : 
 [ N ] ot only do opinions diverge widely , but they are frequently adhered to strongly , even vehemently : at one extreme is the view that since we can never be certain that a computer has been used it is pointless to attempt a distinction , so we should simply evaluate a ' study ' on its content , without reference to its origins ; at the other extreme is the view that using a ' mouse ' to lift an interesting position from a ready @-@ made computer @-@ generated list is in no sense composing , so we should outlaw every such position . 
 Roycroft himself agrees with the latter approach . He continues , " One thing alone is clear to us : the distinction between classical composing and computer composing should be preserved for as long as possible : if there is a name associated with a study diagram that name is a claim of authorship . " 
 Mark <unk> , an International Master , chess trainer , and author , took a more permissive stance . He was commenting in 2006 on a study by Harold van der <unk> , published in 2001 , which reached the position at right after three introductory moves . The drawing move for White is 4 . <unk> ! ! ( and not 4 . Kb5 ) , based on a mutual zugzwang that may occur three moves later . 
 <unk> comments : 
 Here , we should touch on one delicate question . I am sure that this unique endgame position was discovered with the help of Thompson ’ s famous computer database . Is this a ' flaw , ' diminishing the composer 's achievement ? 
 Yes , the computer database is an instrument , available to anyone nowadays . Out of it , no doubt , we could probably extract yet more unique positions – there are some chess composers who do so regularly . The standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved . Thus : miracles , based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas , are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes . 
 = = " Play chess with God " = = 
 On the Bell Labs website , Ken Thompson maintains a link to some of his tablebase data . The headline reads , " Play chess with God . " 
 Regarding Stiller 's long wins , Tim Krabbé struck a similar note : 
 A grandmaster wouldn 't be better at these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday . It 's a sort of chess that has nothing to do with chess , a chess that we could never have imagined without computers . The Stiller moves are awesome , almost scary , because you know they are the truth , God 's Algorithm – it 's like being revealed the Meaning of Life , but you don 't understand one word . 
 = = Nomenclature = = 
 Originally , an endgame tablebase was called an " endgame data base " or " endgame database " . This name appeared in both EG and the ICCA Journal starting in the 1970s , and is sometimes used today . According to Haworth , the ICCA Journal first used the word " tablebase " in connection with chess endgames in 1995 . According to that source , a tablebase contains a complete set of information , but a database might lack some information . 
 Haworth prefers the term " Endgame Table " , and has used it in the articles he has authored . Roycroft has used the term " oracle database " throughout his magazine , EG . Nonetheless , the mainstream chess community has adopted " endgame tablebase " as the most common name .

 " Woman of the Year " is the 17th episode of the second season of the American comedy television series Parks and Recreation , and the 23rd overall episode of the series . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 4 , 2010 . In the episode , Ron is presented with a woman of the year award , much to the frustration of Leslie . Meanwhile , Tom tries to seek investors in a nightclub ownership share , and April helps Andy look for an apartment . 
 The episode was written by Norm Hiscock and directed by Jason Woliner . The script included a theme about the political nature of local awards . " Woman of the Year " featured guest appearances by Ben Schwartz as Jean @-@ Ralphio and Ian Roberts as Ian Winston , both of whom have appeared in the series in past episodes . Rashida Jones , a regular Parks and Recreation cast member who plays Ann Perkins , did not appear in " Woman of the Year " because she was filming scenes for the David Fincher film The Social Network . 
 According to Nielsen Media Research , " Woman of the Year " was seen by 4 @.@ 6 million viewers , which marked a continued recent improvement in ratings for the series . It tied a record set by the previous two episodes , " Sweetums " and " Galentine 's Day " , for the season 's highest rating among viewers aged between 18 and 49 . The episode received generally positive reviews , particularly for the character moments between Leslie and Ron . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The parks and recreation department receives a letter from the Pawnee chapter of the Indiana Organization of Women , which Leslie ( Amy Poehler ) believes is her congratulatory letter as the recipient of the group 's Dorothy Everton Smythe Woman of the Year award . Much to her surprise and disappointment , however , the award has actually gone to Ron ( Nick Offerman ) in recognition of town projects Leslie primarily developed . Ron secretly acknowledges the award as a ridiculous mistake . However , he uses the mistake as an opportunity to tease Leslie before later recommending her as the award recipient . Ron constantly brags about the award , even commissioning a professional photographer to take his official portrait for the award ceremony . Eventually , Ron admits he is joking and attempts to recommend Leslie for the award . However , the IOW director ( Maribeth Monroe ) reveals that a man was strategically chosen for the first time for marketing purposes . Frustrated with the politics of the awards , Leslie and Ron plan for him to make a disparaging acceptance speech condemning the awards . However , at the ceremony itself , Ron instead publicly presents the award to Leslie , to the frustration of the IOW director and members . The next day 's newspaper proclaims Ron the winner , with Leslie and Ron later deciding that the award is meaningless , anyway . The plaque is thrown into a wastebasket , where Leslie later secretly retrieves it . 
 In a subplot , Tom ( Aziz Ansari ) drops off a temporary liquor license renewal at the Snakehole Lounge nightclub , where the owner Freddy ( Andy Milder ) tells him they are seeking investors who can buy a share for $ 10 @,@ 000 . Although he does not have the money , Tom reveals part @-@ ownership in a nightclub is a longtime dream of his , so he seeks assistance from his fast @-@ talking friend , Jean @-@ Ralphio ( Ben Schwartz ) , who contributes $ 5 @,@ 000 .

 " Woman of the Year " was written by Norm Hiscock and directed by Jason Woliner . It featured a guest appearance by Ben Schwartz as Jean @-@ Ralphio , a fast @-@ talking playboy character introduced in " The Set Up " . The episode also featured an appearance by comedian Ian Roberts , who worked with Amy Poehler on the Upright Citizens Brigade sketch comedy troupe . Roberts guest starred as Ian Winston , the coach of a girls ' soccer coach who complains to Leslie about a lack of field space during the episode 's cold open . Roberts previously appeared as the same character in the show 's pilot episode . Rashida Jones , a regular Parks and Recreation cast member who plays Ann Perkins , did not appear in " Woman of the Year " because she was filming scenes for The Social Network , a David Fincher film about the founding of the social @-@ networking website Facebook . 
 The " Woman of the Year " script included a theme about the political nature of awards , arguing despite the value and prestige people like Leslie assign to them , they are ultimately meaningless . Some commentators speculated this subplot served as a commentary about the meaninglessness of award ceremonies in the entertainment industry . " Woman of the Year " originally aired three days before the 82nd Academy Awards , prompting Entertainment Weekly to suggest it was a commentary about the Oscars , whereas others suggested the episode was a joke about how Parks and Recreation itself has failed to win any awards at the Golden Globes , Screen Actors Guild Awards or the Emmys . 
 Shortly after the episode aired , a copy of the " Pawnee Journal " newspaper article announcing Ron Swanson 's Woman of the Year award win , which was featured within the episode , was posted in a downloadable form on the " Pawnee , Indiana " website set up by NBC .

 Although the Woman of the Year award is formally named after the fictional feminist leader Dorothy Everton Smythe , Ron mistakenly calls it the " Dorothy Everytime Smurf Girl Trophy for Excellence in Female Stuff " , a reference to the cartoon , The Smurfs .

When Jean Ralphio tried to make a pass at April , she replied , " Don 't you work at Lady Foot Locker ? " , a women 's footwear retailer . Ron mistakenly refers to Leslie 's Camp Athena as " Camp Xena " , a reference to the protagonist from the fantasy adventure television series Xena : Warrior Princess . In seeking nightclub investments from his co @-@ workers , Tom presents a computer presentation with photos of several celebrities , including reality television stars Jon Gosselin and Nicole " Snooki " Polizzi . In defending his financial gift to Tom , Andy calls it an investment and compares himself to businessman Warren Buffett , incorrectly pronouncing the nickname like a dinner buffet .

This marked a continued recent improvement in ratings for the series , especially because " Woman of the Year " performed well despite direct competition from the popular reality television singing competition American Idol , which also aired during its time period . 
 " Woman of the Year " received generally positive reviews . Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly called " Woman of the Year " one of the best episodes of the second season , particularly complimenting the one @-@ liner jokes and ensemble cast performances . Gonzalez said she particularly liked the " big brother @-@ little sister vibe " between Leslie and Ron . The Star @-@ Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall said " Woman of the Year " was well @-@ executed because revealing to the viewers that Ron was going to tease Leslie made his pranks more humorous and less mean @-@ spirited . Sepinwall also said the episode had several good moments for the supporting characters , including Andy 's selfless act toward Tom and Donna 's purchase of shares with the nightclub . The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler said he liked that Ron genuinely cares for Leslie . Heisler said : " If he resented Leslie as much as he hinted at during season one , it 'd become an ongoing thorn in the show 's foot that during every single episode . [ ... ] Getting along is underrated in comedy . " 
 Steve Kandell of New York magazine said the episode felt like " a bit of a place @-@ holder " compared to other episodes in the season , but that " Woman of the Year " included amusing scenes and introduced new ways to mock bureaucracy " without every feeling like the sly satire it secretly is " . Kandell also said he enjoyed the jokes at Leslie 's and Jerry 's expense . Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said every character was at their best , and that he particularly enjoyed Ron 's taunting of Leslie once it was made clear he was only joking . Gallagher said the " only thing about this episode I didn 't love " was the way the subplot involving Tom 's investment with the nightclub ended , because she felt it " started off strong , but kind of went nowhere . " Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was not a stand @-@ out , but offered great character moments between Leslie and Ron .

 = Bani Zeid = 
 Bani Zeid ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> ) is a Palestinian town in the Ramallah and al @-@ Bireh Governorate in the north @-@ central West Bank , located 27 kilometers ( 17 mi ) northwest of Ramallah , about 45 kilometers northwest of Jerusalem and about 6 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) southwest of Salfit . A town of over 5 @,@ 500 inhabitants , Bani Zeid was founded when the villages of Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima merged to form a municipality in 1966 during Jordanian rule . The town owes its name to the Arab tribe that was granted the area as a fief by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin in the 12th century for having served in the Muslim army during the first Crusades . It was settled by members of the tribe alongside the native fellahin ( " peasantry " ) during the reign of Mamluk sultan Baibars in the mid @-@ 13th century . During Ottoman rule , the area of Bani Zeid served as a sheikdom with some administrative capacity . It consisted of several villages with Deir Ghassaneh as its center . During that time , the Barghouti family dominated the sheikdom . 
 During the 1936 – 39 Arab revolt against British Mandate rule , Deir Ghassaneh was the scene of rebel gatherings and British military raids . In 1967 , Bani Zeid was occupied by Israel during the Six @-@ Day War , but it was transferred to full Palestinian security and administrative control in 2000 . The next year it became the first Palestinian @-@ controlled town to be the site of major operation by Israeli forces during the Second Intifada . When <unk> Barghouti <unk> was elected mayor in 2005 , Bani Zeid became the first Palestinian locality with a woman as head of the municipality , in concurrence with nearby Ramallah . The current mayor is Abdel Karim Abu Aql , elected in 2012 . 
 Historically , Bani Zeid 's economy was dependent on the olive crop , which was supplied to soap factories in Nablus . Until the present day , olive trees cover most of the town 's cultivable land . However , the residents of Bani Zeid today largely derive their income from employment in the civil service and private business . There are a number of archaeological sites in Bani Zeid , including the old town of Deir Ghassaneh , the manor of Sheikh Salih al @-@ Barghouti and the maqam ( " saintly person 's tomb " ) of Sheikh al @-@ Khawwas . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 Deir Ghassaneh has been identified as the ancient <unk> ( also spelled <unk> ) , hometown of <unk> . According to some sources , it was settled by the Ghassanids , an Arab Christian tribal confederation , after it was abandoned by the Israelites . English orientalist Edward Henry Palmer ( 1840 – 1882 ) thought the name meant " The monastery of the Ghassaneh [ Ghassanids ] " . However , according to Moshe Sharon ( b . 1937 ) , Israeli professor of Islamic history and civilisation , this claim has been dismissed by a number of researchers since the Ghassanids did not have a history of settlement in Samaria , the modern @-@ day northern West Bank . Sharon suggests that the name of the village is related to the Arabic word <unk> which means " very handsome " or suggests " youth and beauty " . Byzantine ceramics have been found in Deir Ghassaneh , and on the north side of Beit Rima . In addition , small fragments of a marble column were found in Deir Ghassaneh . In Beit Rima , sherds from the Iron Age I and IA II , Persian , Hellenistic , Roman , Byzantine , Crusader / Ayyubid , Mamluk and Early Ottoman remains have been found . In Deir Ghassaneh , sherds from all of the same periods , except Persian , have also been found . 
 According to Sharon , there is no mention of Deir Ghassaneh or Beit Rima in early Arabic sources , although it is known that Deir Ghassaneh was inhabited during the Mamluk period due to the many houses there that have preserved elements of Mamluk architecture . Specific examples include the use of the ablaq technique of alternating stones of different colors , particularly red and white , that decorate the facades and gates of some houses . 
 = = = Establishment of Bani Zeid tribe in Palestine = = = 
 The modern town of Bani Zeid receives its name from the Arab tribe of Bani Zeid , who settled in Palestine during the Ayyubid period in the late 12th @-@ century . They formed part of the Bedouin units of Saladin 's army that hailed from the Hejaz . After the Siege of Jerusalem in 1187 , Saladin 's forces captured the city and the Ayyubid army was garrisoned there . The Bani Zeid temporarily resided in Jerusalem and a street , located near the present @-@ day al @-@ Sa <unk> Street , was named after them , but has since been renamed . 
 In order for Saladin to persuade the Hejazi Arab tribes that joined his army to remain in Palestine , he offered each tribe a cluster of villages captured from the Crusaders as iqta ' ( fiefs ) to settle in and control . The Bani Zeid were granted the villages of Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima , as well as the nearby towns of Kafr Ein and <unk> . However , it was not until 1293 , after the Bahri Mamluks under Sultan Baibars conquered the coastal strip of Palestine and expelled the last of the Crusaders , that the Bani Zeid tribe settled in those villages . 
 A Mamluk @-@ era ( 1260 – 1516 ) stone inscription belonging to an unidentified building in Deir Ghassaneh dating from 1330 describes a two @-@ story " felicitous palace " with a garden . The palace was apparently an asset of the Sultan al @-@ Nasir Muhammad and was inspected by Isa Muhammad al @-@ <unk> , a low @-@ ranking emir from the Mosul region in charge of overseeing the personal assets of the sultan . In 1480 Deir Ghassaneh @-@ based tribesmen from the Bani Zeid attacked Jerusalem as retaliation for the governor 's execution of some of its members who had been accused of revolting against the Burji Mamluk authorities . 
 = = = Early Ottoman era = = = 
 During the Ottoman era in Palestine , the area where the Bani Zeid tribe settled became the nahiya ( subdistrict ) of Bani Zeid , part of the larger sanjak ( district ) of Quds ( Jerusalem ) . The nahiya contained over 20 towns and villages and had jurisdiction over a part of Salfit . While these villages were registered and organized like other villages in the Jerusalem Sanjak , they were also treated as a group . Each village was led by a ra 'is ( local chief ) and the entire Bani Zeid Nahiya was headed by a sheikh ( paramount chief ) . The Bani Zeid sheikdom would serve as a political @-@ administrative unit for the purposes of tax collection and army mobilization . 
 In 1556 the sheikdom was led by Sheikh Abu <unk> bin Sheikh Manna , who was succeeded by Sheikh Muhammad Abu Rabban in 1560 . Olive oil was the primary commodity that Bani Zeid Nahiya produced and the product was sold to local Ottoman officials and soap factories in Nablus . The Ottomans imposed taxes on olive oil , wheat and barley , and the sheikh was responsible for paying the revenues of collected taxes to the Ottoman authorities . In addition , Bani Zeid was required to finance a waqf ( religious endowment ) to the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron . In 1596 both Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima appeared in Ottoman tax registers and both villages paid taxes on wheat , barley , olive trees , fruit trees , vineyards , goats and / or beehives . Deir Ghassaneh had a population of 76 households , all Muslim , while Beit Rima had 54 Muslim households and 14 Christian households . During the course of the 16th @-@ century , most of Beit Rima 's Christian inhabitants had emigrated from the village to Jerusalem , Ramla and Gaza , although the Christian population that remained continued to grow . 
 = = = Nineteenth century = = = 
 In the 19th @-@ century Bani Zeid was one of 21 sheikdoms in the central highlands of Palestine . While its exact borders varied from time to time , it was generally marked by the Wadi al @-@ <unk> stream to the south , which separated it from the Bani Harith al @-@ <unk> sheikdom , and the Wadi <unk> stream to the north that separated it from Bilad Jamma 'in . The Bani Zeid sheikdom contained the highest slopes and the largest concentration of mountain faults of all the highland sheikdoms . About two @-@ thirds of its villages were situated on relatively wide hilltops while the remainder were built along slopes . None were located in the valleys or the foothills . In 1838 English biblical scholars Edward Robinson and Eli Smith noted that the Bani Zeid Nahiya consisted of 18 inhabited localities and four <unk> ( abandoned or ruined villages ) . They classified Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima as inhabited by Muslims . 
 In the early 19th @-@ century the paramount sheikhs of Bani Zeid were Sheikh <unk> al @-@ Barghouti and Sheikh ' Asi al @-@ Rabbah Barghouti . They belonged to the wealthy noble family of al @-@ Barghouti , a sub @-@ clan of the Bani Zeid tribe that traditionally provided the leaders of the sheikdom . Its members were generally referred to as <unk> and the clan consisted of nine branches whose collective power extended beyond the Bani Zeid sheikdom to the coastal plain of Palestine . During the period of Khedivate Egyptian rule in the Levant ( 1832 – 1840 ) , Sheikh ' Abd al @-@ Jabir al @-@ Barghouti , a nephew of Sheikh <unk> , served as the chief of the Bani Zeid . Sheikh ' Abd al @-@ Jabir belonged to the al @-@ Zahir branch of the family which was based in Deir Ghassaneh . Deir Ghassaneh served as the sheikdom 's <unk> al @-@ <unk> ( throne village or capital ) . During the early part of Egyptian rule , Governor Ibrahim Pasha had Sheikh ' Abd al @-@ Jabir executed . He was succeeded by Sheikh Ali al @-@ Rabbah , another leading Barghouti sheikh and a son of Sheikh Asi . The latter was also subsequently executed on the orders of Ibrahim Pasha . Both sheikhs and their peasant fighters had fought against Egyptian rule during the 1834 Peasants ' Revolt that spread throughout Palestine . During the last years of Egyptian control , Sheikh Musa Ahmad al @-@ <unk> of Abwein became the paramount sheikh of the Bani Zeid and continued to exercise great influence over the sheikdom when the Egyptian military withdrew from Palestine in 1841 . 
 In the second half of the 19th @-@ century Bani Zeid was officially ruled by Sheikh Salih al @-@ Barghouti , although he struggled to maintain full authority over the sheikdom , having to contend with his Abwein @-@ based rival Sheikh Musa and his family , al @-@ <unk> . The latter controlled seven villages in the eastern part of the sheikdom , while the Barghouti maintained control over twelve villages in the western part . The two domains were separated by a wadi ( seasonal stream ) . Nonetheless , Sheikh Salih enjoyed high political and social status , holding the official title of sheikh al @-@ nahiya ( chief of the subdistrict ) and was also referred to locally as sheikh al @-@ <unk> ( chief of the chieftains ) . The title ceased to be recognized by the Istanbul @-@ based central government in 1864 , but locally the title continued to demonstrate the guise of official authority . As sheikh al @-@ nahiya , Sheikh Salih was tasked with the nomination and dismissal of <unk> ( village headmen ) and maintaining order through local custom . He also served as the multazim ( tax collector ) of the Bani Zeid sheikdom on behalf of the Ottoman authorities , despite the ban on tax @-@ farming in 1853 . This role in particular enabled the Barghouti clan to acquire vast wealth and property either forcefully or through legal transfer . During previous inter @-@ family disputes , members of the clan had begun to settle in the surrounding villages of Beit Rima , <unk> and Deir Nidham . 
 As members of the Qais tribo @-@ political faction , in opposition to the Yaman faction , the Barghouti aligned themselves with Qaisi @-@ affiliated Bedouin tribes and other prominent families , including the Khalidi clan of Jerusalem , the ' Amr , ' Azza and ' <unk> clans of the Hebron area and the Samhan clan of the Bani Harith nahiya to the north . In 1855 – 1856 tensions between Sheikh Salih and the leading families of Nablus broke out into fierce clashes . Sheikh Salih was eventually able to compel the Ottoman authorities to take the local rulers of Nablus to task . The restive sheikhs of the Jerusalem and Hebron regions were called to Damascus to conclude a lasting peace , but all were condemned to exile in Trabzon , northern Anatolia , with the exception of Sheikh Salih who apparently impressed the governor and was allowed to return to Deir Ghassaneh . The Barghouti clan would later support the Dar Hammad tribe against the Dar Hamid , both of which were engaged in a feud in nearby <unk> . In one day of fighting , 20 men were killed , prompting <unk> Pasha , the governor of Jerusalem , to personally intervene with a detachment of Ottoman troops which forced both factions to withdraw . 
 French explorer Victor Guérin visited both Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima in 1863 . He noted that the former had a population of roughly 900 and was built on a mountain overlooking hills filled with " magnificent " olive groves . Beit Rima had a smaller population of 350 , and was situated on a high plateau covered with olive and fig groves . The houses of both villages were constructed from red and white stone masonry and the mosque in Deir Ghassaneh , which Guérin regarded as noteworthy , was built from black and white stone . The home of Deir Ghassaneh 's sheikh , who maintained a level of sovereignty over about 15 villages and hamlets in the area , and the members of his family , were particularly large and sturdily built . According to Sharon , the sheikh Guérin had referred to was Sheikh Salih . It was around this time , in the late 1860s , that the prominent al @-@ Husayni clan of Jerusalem unsuccessfully attempted to form an alliance with the Barghouti clan , initially through diplomatic means . Afterward , they commissioned their allies in Istanbul to launch a propaganda campaign against the Barghouti clan , accusing them of undermining the sultan . This allegation was evidenced by the disruption of Jerusalem 's water supply by the peasant fighters of the Bani Zeid led by Sheikh Salih , who closed off the aqueduct from Solomon 's Pools to the south of Bethlehem . 
 In the 1887 census the Bani Zeid sheikdom consisted of 24 villages with an estimated collective population of 7 @,@ 700 , including 400 Christians . According to the census , Deir Ghassaneh had 1 @,@ 200 inhabitants living in 196 households , making it significantly larger than the surrounding localities . There were nine elite households , each of whose family head was recognized by the census as a sheikh . The local imam , Muhammad Shams al @-@ Din al @-@ Shaykh Hanafi , was Egyptian and one of five men in Deir Ghassaneh born outside the village . The Palestine Exploration Fund 's Survey of Western Palestine ( SWP ) in the late 19th @-@ century stated Deir Ghassaneh was " a village on a ridge , with springs in the valley below . It is of moderate size , built of stone and has olives beneath it . " The SWP described Beit Rima as " a small village on the summit of a ridge with wells to the west " .

 Sheikh Salih was succeeded by his son Umar Salih al @-@ Barghouti , who aligned Bani Zeid with the Nashashibi clan of Jerusalem against the al @-@ Husayni clan in the contest for political dominance in Palestine during the British Mandate period . In 1936 , during the Arab revolt in Palestine , the British Air Force struck a group of 400 local militiamen gathered outside of Deir Ghassaneh , killing about 130 of the fighters . Later , in September 1938 , the local rebel leadership held a meeting in the village where it was decided that Abd al @-@ Rahim al @-@ Hajj Muhammad and Arif Abd al @-@ Raziq would each serve as general commander of the revolt on a rotational basis . Deir Ghassaneh was subsequently attacked by British forces backed by fighter planes when they were informed of the conference . A rebel commander , Muhammad al @-@ Salih , was killed in the ensuing firefight . The British Mandate Antiquities Authority noted in a January 1947 report that Deir Ghassaneh was " built on a medieval site , " and on a hill 500 meters ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) west of the village was a two @-@ domed shrine dedicated to a Sheikh <unk> . 
 Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima were merged and granted municipal status in February 1966 during Jordanian rule , partially due to the efforts of Kassim al @-@ Rimawi , the rural affairs minister at the time and a native of Beit Rima . Its first mayor , Adib Mohammed Rimawi , was appointed by King Hussein . The municipality building is located in Beit Rima . In June 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank after defeating Arab forces in the Six Day War . In 1972 the first municipal polls were held and Fa <unk> Ali Rimawi was elected . In 1978 Bani Zeid was one of several Palestinian localities to append its municipal seal to the Memorandum from the masses and the institutions of the West Bank to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a display of unity with the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) . The memorandum was a rejection of any solution , regardless of its origin , not containing a clear recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self @-@ determination and to establishing an independent Palestinian national state . In 2000 Bani Zeid was incorporated into Area A giving the Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) , the Palestinian governing body established after the Oslo Agreements with Israel in 1993 , full control over security and civilian affairs in the town . 
 In the late night hours of 24 October 2001 , during the Second Intifada , the Israeli Army ( IDF ) launched an incursion into Beit Rima in what became the first major Israeli military raid into Palestinian @-@ controlled territory , according to Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) . The IDF stated the intent of the raid was to capture the alleged killers of Israeli Tourism Minister <unk> Ze 'evi , who was shot dead by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) in retaliation for Israel 's assassination of the party 's leader Mustafa <unk> ( Abu Ali Mustafa ) in August . About 50 people from Beit Rima were detained and brought to the Israeli settlement of Halamish for interrogation . Most were released before the day 's end , but eleven men remained in Israeli custody , two of whom Israel alleged to be directly involved in Ze 'evi 's assassination . In the course of the raid , Israeli forces killed six Palestinians , including three members of the Palestinian National Security Forces and two officers from the Civil Police , and wounded seven others . The Palestinian authorities in Beit Rima stated they had not received prior warning from the IDF and their slain men had been resting in an olive grove near the local police station , while Israeli military officials stated all those killed had either fired on Israeli forces or approached them threateningly and all were members of various armed groups . The HRW stated that the Red Crescent was prevented from treating the injured men until 7 : 00 am , a delay that resulted in the death of two of the police officers . Israeli forces also demolished three homes in the town , alleging that they belonged to family members of Ze 'evi 's killers .

 Ottoman village statistics from 1870 showed that " Der <unk> " had 164 houses and a population of 559 , while " Bet Rima " had 60 houses and a population of 220 , though in both cases the population count included only men . In the Ottoman census of 1887 , Deir Ghassaneh 's population of 196 households ( roughly 1 @,@ 200 people ) was homogeneous , everyone being Muslim , and with the exception of five individuals , all the males had been born in the village . The estimated 9 % of the inhabitants who were born outside the village were almost exclusively women , with one fifth of all females hailing primarily from other villages in the Bani Zeid nahiya such as Beit Rima , Abwein , <unk> and Kafr Ein and about 14 women originating from other parts of Palestine , particularly al @-@ <unk> Ascalon . Several men from Deir Ghassaneh settled in the surrounding villages , namely Beit Rima , Deir Nidham and Nabi Salih . 
 In the 1922 census of Palestine , conducted by the British Mandatory authorities , " Dair Ghassaneh " had a population of 625 , while " Bait Rema " had a population of 555 , all Muslims . In the 1931 census Deir Ghassaneh had 181 occupied houses and a population of 753 , while Beit Rima had had 175 occupied houses and a population of 746 , still all Muslim . In a land and population survey by Sami Hadawi in 1945 both villages had a total population of 1 @,@ 810 . Beit Rima had a slightly larger population , but Deir Ghassaneh had a larger land area .

 Historically , Deir Ghassaneh depended primarily on olive cultivation , and until the present day most of Bani Zeid 's cultivable land is covered by olive orchards . The cultivation of other fruit trees is significantly lower , with almonds being a distant second at 240 dunams . Other crops grown include grains which cover 135 dunams and onions , dry legumes and fodder to a lesser degree . Only 1 % of the town 's residents own livestock and according to the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture , there were 1 @,@ 880 goats , 268 sheep , 12 cows and 281 beehives in Bani Zeid in 2009 . Agriculture currently accounts for 10 % of labor in the town . 
 Today , employment by the Palestinian government and private businesses is the dominant economic activity in Bani Zeid , making up around 70 % of the town 's workforce . The trade sector accounts for 10 % of the labor force , followed by the industrial sector which makes up 8 % . Work in the Israeli labor market employs around 2 % of the working population . Unemployment in the town was at 20 % in 2011 . According to the Bani Zeid Municipality , there are 26 grocery stores , 26 public service venues , 11 workshops , a bakery , a butchery and two olive oil presses in the town . 
 A school was founded in Deir Ghassaneh in 1925 . Prior to the British Mandate period , boys would normally receive education in a <unk> , an elementary @-@ type school with Islamic law and tradition having a major influence on the curriculum . Today , there is one elementary school ( Bani Zeid Elementary School ) and one secondary school ( Bashir al @-@ Barghouti Secondary School ) in the town of Bani Zeid , both run by the government . According to the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education , in the 2010 @-@ 2011 academic year there were 26 classes occupied by 691 students , both male and female .

 = = Governance = = 
 Bani Zeid is governed by a municipal council of 13 members , including the chairman ( mayor ) and vice @-@ chairman , under the name Municipality of West Bani Zaid . In normal circumstances the town holds election every four years . In the 2005 elections , the Hamas @-@ affiliated party won five municipal seats , including the post of mayor , which was won by a female candidate <unk> Barghouti <unk> who , along with Janet Mikhail of Ramallah , became the first woman to hold the post of a Palestinian municipality head . The Fatah list won five seats , the Palestinian People 's Party ( PPP ) list won one , and a socialist party won the remaining seat . 
 During an Israeli raid in Bani Zeid in 2007 , two Hamas party members in the municipal council were arrested by Israeli authorities along with dozens of other Palestinian mayors , parliament members and ministers belonging to Hamas throughout the West Bank . The arrest of the two put the number of incarcerated West Bani Zeid Municipality Hamas members to three ( member ' Ala Rimawi was elected to his post while serving a prison sentence . ) 
 In the most recent polls in 2012 , Abdel Karim Abu Aql was elected mayor on a leftist alliance list as were the other 12 people elected to the council . The elections were boycotted by Hamas . Bani Zeid has had six mayors since the establishment of the municipality in 1966 . 
 The municipal council takes part in the international town twinning scheme , and have twinned with <unk> in France . 
 = = Religious sites = = 
 One of the notable characteristics of Deir Ghassaneh was the concentration of 16 local Muslim shrines or saintly @-@ person tombs ( maqam , pl. maqamat ) in its vicinity which served as visitation sites for the pre @-@ 20th @-@ century Palestinian community . According to author and ethnographer Johann <unk> , their locations near Jerusalem also " contributed to the image of an Islamic Holy Land , " which brought further prosperity to the inhabitants of the villages of Bani Zeid who benefited from providing services to pilgrims . The Barghouti family served as patrons for the various religious sheikhs who oversaw the shrines . The maqamat were dedicated either to prophets ( <unk> ) recognized by the Qur 'an or saintly @-@ persons known as <unk> , whom locals believed had been " close to God . " The veneration of the <unk> tombs , a common feature in peasant life , did not derive from the orthodox Islam which was practiced more strictly in the urban centers , and was rooted in local pre @-@ Islamic , including Christian , tradition . 
 All the maqamat of Bani Zeid were designed differently , with some being rustic tombstones and others built more elaborately . The latter types consisted of a domed mausoleum known as a <unk> , a shelter known as a <unk> <unk> , a garden , a well and either a distinguishable olive or oak tree . Most of the upkeep of the buildings was provided by <unk> ( " religious endowments " ) . One of the shrines was considered by the local peasantry to be a place to safeguard firewood and outside the reach of potential thieves . The maqamat were also divided by status , with some bearing significance only to an individual village or clan and some collectively revered by the residents of the sheikhdom . Of all the sites in the Bani Zeid sheikhdom , the most venerated shrine was that of Nabi Salih , dedicated to the prophet ( <unk> ) Salih , which held special significance beyond Bani Zeid . 
 = = = Maqam al @-@ Khawwas = = = 
 One of the notable maqamat close to the modern town of Bani Zeid is Maqam al @-@ Khawwas ( var . <unk> , Khawwas and <unk> ) , a double @-@ domed building situated on a hilltop 500 meters west of Deir Ghassaneh , in an isolated area . Along with the maqamat of al @-@ Rifa 'i or al @-@ Majdoub , Maqam al @-@ Khawwas was a shrine of major importance for the Bani Zeid villages , collectively . The maqam honored what was locally considered to be the meditation site of al @-@ <unk> , believed to be a Sufi holy man ( <unk> ) from Egypt who often visited the residents of the area . 
 It contained a mihrab ( " niche indicating direction towards Mecca . " ) The maqam was noted by Guérin in 1863 . Its eastern dome was constructed by the residents of Deir Ghassaneh , while local legend holds the western dome was completed by angels . The interior of the domes were simple and typical of most maqamat domes , lacking cross @-@ vault roofing which was a common feature for most of Deir Ghassaneh 's buildings . The sanctuary had a two @-@ door entrance on its northern end . The interior walls were whitewashed , reflecting the Muslim tradition of heavenly light and spirit in the color white . A few verses from the Qur 'an were written on parts of the walls . The tomb of al @-@ Khawwas was covered in white cloth . A small niche on the western wall was fitted for an oil lamp . 
 An important feature that distinguished Maqam al @-@ Khawwas from the Deir Ghassaneh mosque was that it acted primarily as a women 's domain whereas the mosque had largely been a male domain . In the pre @-@ British Mandate era , it was frequented by women on a daily basis and during a seasonal pilgrimage for women known as <unk> al @-@ <unk> . During this pilgrimage , which coincided with the Nabi Salih pilgrimage , a largely male affair , large groups of women and children from the villages of Bani Zeid would visit the Khawwas mausoleum to celebrate festivities , socialize with other women and pray . According to Palestinian architecture expert <unk> <unk> , Maqam al @-@ Khawwas 's isolation and the ritual of having to travel uphill to reach the sanctuary added to the tranquil feeling of the visit . 
 = = Manor of Salih al @-@ Barghouti = = 
 The late 19th @-@ century chief of the Bani Zeid sheikhdom , Sheikh Salih al @-@ Barghouti , resided in a large palace @-@ like manor in Deir Ghassaneh . The first floor and portions of the second floor were originally built in 1602 . In 1862 @-@ 63 Sheikh Salih renovated the manor which became known locally as " Saraya al @-@ Sheikh Salih al @-@ Barghouti " and built the remainder of the second floor . The building was divided into three main components , namely the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> . The <unk> included a reception area , dining halls and a guesthouse while the <unk> consisted of workshops , food depots and horse stables . The <unk> , on the second floor , served as the living quarters for women and servants . Above the living quarters hung the sheikh 's ' retreat and leisure area from which he could view his estates . 
 According to <unk> , Sheikh Salih 's manor , along with other Barghouti family palace compounds , " was strongly influenced by urban architecture " in light of its " majestic scale , ornate fine stone work and the introverted spatial organisation . " The manor , which has a rectangular ground plan , roughly measures 23 meters by 34 meters . An open courtyard occupied the central position of the manor . The courtyard was mostly enclosed by four partially open arcades known as riwaqs which either serves as stables or storage . 
 The main gate of the palace consists of two arches , with one being built within the other . According to Sharon , while this gate structure was common among village manors in the area , the gate of Sheikh Salih 's palace was " particularly monumental " as the arch was pointed and contained one keystone . The entire arch was constructed in the ablaq style with alternating black and white stone . A large , heavy and decorated wooden door is fitted into the gate and it was used to receive vehicles or large loads while a smaller door for personal use was built in the center of the larger door . A smaller secondary entrance was located at the building 's northern side , vertically parallel of the main entrance .

 = Stigand = 
 Stigand ( Latin : <unk> ; died 1072 ) was an Anglo @-@ Saxon churchman in pre @-@ Norman Conquest England who became Archbishop of Canterbury . His birth date is unknown , but by 1020 he was serving as a royal chaplain and advisor . He was named Bishop of Elmham in 1043 , and was later Bishop of Winchester and Archbishop of Canterbury . Stigand was as an advisor to several members of the Anglo @-@ Saxon and Norman English royal dynasties , serving six successive kings . <unk> by several popes for his pluralism in holding the two sees , or bishoprics , of Winchester and Canterbury concurrently , he was finally deposed in 1070 , and his estates and personal wealth were confiscated by William the Conqueror . Stigand was imprisoned at Winchester , where he died without regaining his liberty . 
 Stigand served King Cnut as a chaplain at a royal foundation at Ashingdon in 1020 , and as an advisor then and later . He continued in his role of advisor during the reigns of Cnut 's sons , Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut . When Cnut 's stepson Edward the Confessor succeeded Harthacnut , Stigand in all probability became England 's main administrator . Monastic writers of the time accused Stigand of extorting money and lands from the church , and by 1066 the only estates richer than Stigand 's were the royal estates and those of Harold Godwinson . 
 In 1043 Edward appointed Stigand to the see of Elmham . Four years later he was appointed to the see of Winchester , and then in 1052 to the archdiocese of Canterbury , which Stigand held jointly with that of Winchester . Five successive popes , including Nicholas II and Alexander II , excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury . Stigand was present at the deathbed of King Edward and at the coronation of Harold Godwinson as king of England in 1066 . After Harold 's death , Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror . On Christmas Day 1066 Ealdred , the Archbishop of York , crowned William King of England . Stigand 's excommunication meant that he could only assist at the coronation . 
 Despite growing pressure for his deposition , Stigand continued to attend the royal court and to consecrate bishops , until in 1070 he was deposed by papal legates and imprisoned at Winchester . His intransigence towards the papacy was used as propaganda by Norman advocates of the view that the English church was backward and needed reform . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Neither the year nor the date of Stigand 's birth is known . He was born in East Anglia , possibly in Norwich , to an apparently prosperous family of mixed English and Scandinavian ancestry , as is shown by the fact that Stigand 's name was Norse but his brother 's was English . His brother Æthelmær , also a cleric , later succeeded Stigand as bishop of Elmham . His sister held land in Norwich , but her given name is unrecorded . 
 Stigand first appears in the historical record in 1020 as a royal chaplain to King Cnut of England ( reigned 1016 – 1035 ) . In that year he was appointed to Cnut 's church at Ashingdon , or <unk> , which was dedicated by the reforming bishop Wulfstan of York . Little is known of Stigand 's life during Cnut 's reign , but he must have had a place at the royal court , as he witnessed occasional charters . Following Cnut 's death Stigand successively served Cnut 's sons , Harold Harefoot ( reigned 1035 – 1040 ) and Harthacnut ( reigned 1040 – 1042 ) . After Harthacnut died Stigand became an advisor to Emma of Normandy , Cnut 's widow and the mother of Harthacnut and his successor Edward the Confessor . He may have been Emma 's chaplain , and it is possible that Stigand was already one of her advisors while Cnut was alive , and that he owed his position at Ashingdon to Emma 's influence and favour . Because little is known of Stigand 's activities before his appointment as a bishop , it is difficult to determine to whom he owed his position . 
 = = Bishop of Elmham and Winchester = = 
 Stigand was appointed to the see of Elmham shortly after Edward the Confessor 's coronation on 3 April 1043 , probably on Emma 's advice . This was the first episcopal appointment of Edward 's reign . The diocese of Elmham covered East Anglia in eastern England , and was one of the poorer episcopal sees at that time . He was consecrated bishop in 1043 , but later that year Edward deposed Stigand and deprived him of his wealth . During the next year , however , Edward returned Stigand to office . The reasons for the deposition are unknown , but it was probably connected to the simultaneous fall from power of the dowager queen , Emma . Some sources state that Emma had invited King Magnus I of Norway , a rival claimant to the English throne , to invade England and had offered her personal wealth to aid Magnus . Some suspected that Stigand had urged Emma to support Magnus , and claimed that his deposition was because of this . Contributing factors in Emma and Stigand 's fall included Emma 's wealth , and dislike of her political influence , which was linked to the reign of the unpopular Harthacnut . 
 By 1046 Stigand had begun to witness charters of Edward the Confessor , showing that he was once again in royal favour . In 1047 Stigand was translated to the see of Winchester , but he retained Elmham until 1052 . He may have owed the promotion to Earl Godwin of Wessex , the father @-@ in @-@ law of King Edward , although that is disputed by some historians . Emma , who had retired to Winchester after regaining Edward 's favour , may also have influenced the appointment , either alone or in concert with Godwin . After his appointment to Winchester , Stigand was a witness to all the surviving charters of King Edward during the period 1047 to 1052 . 
 Some historians , such as Frank Barlow and Emma Mason , state that Stigand supported Earl Godwin in his quarrel with Edward the Confessor in 1051 – 1052 ; others , including Ian Walker , hold that he was neutral . Stigand , whether or not he was a supporter of Godwin 's , did not go into exile with the earl . The quarrel started over a fight between Eustace of Boulogne , brother @-@ in @-@ law of the king , and men of the town of Dover . The king ordered Godwin to punish the town , and the earl refused . Continued pressure from Edward undermined Godwin 's position , and the earl and his family fled England in 1051 . The earl returned in 1052 with a substantial armed force , but eventually reached a peaceful accord with the king . Some medieval sources state that Stigand took part in the negotiations that reached a peace between the king and his earl ; the Canterbury manuscript of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle calls Stigand the king 's chaplain and advisor during the negotiations . 
 = = Archbishop of Canterbury = = 
 = = = Appointment to Canterbury and issues with the papacy = = = 
 The Archbishopric of Canterbury became drawn into the conflict between Edward and Godwin . Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the Gregorian Reform . Leo first focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony – the buying and selling of clerical and ecclesiastical offices . In 1049 Leo IX publicly pronounced that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them . When Archbishop <unk> of Canterbury died in 1051 the monks of the cathedral chapter elected Æthelric , a relative of Earl Godwin 's , as archbishop . King Edward opposed the election and instead appointed Robert of Jumièges , who was Norman and already Bishop of London . Besides furthering Edward 's quarrel with Godwin , the appointment signalled that there were limits to Edward 's willingness to compromise on ecclesiastical reform . 
 Although not known as a reformer before his appointment , Robert returned in 1051 from Rome , where he had gone to be confirmed by the papacy , and opposed the king 's choice for Bishop of London on the grounds that the candidate was not suitable . Robert 's attempts to recover church property that had been appropriated by Earl Godwin contributed to the quarrel between the earl and the king . When Godwin returned to England in 1052 Robert was outlawed and exiled , following which King Edward appointed Stigand to the archbishopric . The appointment was either a reward from Godwin for Stigand 's support during the conflict with Edward or a reward from King Edward for successfully negotiating a peaceful conclusion to the crisis in 1052 . Stigand was the first non @-@ monk to be appointed to either English archbishopric since before the days of Dunstan ( archbishop from 959 to 988 ) . 
 The papacy refused to recognise Stigand 's elevation , as Robert was still alive and had not been deprived of office by a pope . Robert of Jumièges appealed to Leo IX , who summoned Stigand to Rome . When Stigand did not appear , he was excommunicated . Historian Nicholas Brooks holds the view that Stigand was not excommunicated at this time , but rather was ordered to refrain from any archiepiscopal functions , such as the consecration of bishops . He argues that in 1062 papal legates sat in council with Stigand , something they would not have done had he been excommunicated . The legates did nothing to alter Stigand 's position either , although one of the legates later helped depose Stigand in 1070 . However Pope Leo IX and his successors , Victor II and Stephen IX , continued to regard Stigand as uncanonically elected . 
 Stigand did not travel to Rome to receive a pallium , the band worn around the neck that is the symbol of an archbishop 's authority , from the pope . Traveling to Rome for the pallium had become a custom , practised by a number of his predecessors . Instead , some medieval chroniclers state that he used Robert of Jumièges ' pallium . It is not known if Stigand even petitioned the papacy for a pallium soon after his appointment . Owing to the reform movement , Stigand probably knew the request would be unsuccessful . In 1058 Antipope Benedict X , who opposed much of the reform movement , gave Stigand a pallium . However , Benedict was deposed in the following year ; the reforming party declared Benedict an antipope , and nullified all his acts , including Stigand 's pallium grant . The exact circumstances that led to Benedict granting a pallium are unknown , whether it was at Stigand 's request or was given without prompting . 
 After his translation to Canterbury , Stigand released Elmham to his brother Æthelmær , but retained the bishopric of Winchester . Canterbury and Winchester were the two richest sees in England , and while precedent allowed the holding of a rich see along with a poor one , there was no precedent for holding two rich sees concurrently . He may have retained Winchester out of avarice , or his hold on Canterbury may not have been secure . Besides these , he held the abbey of Gloucester and the abbey of Ely and perhaps other abbeys also . Whatever his reasons , the retention of Winchester made Stigand a pluralist : the holder of more than one benefice at the same time . This was a practice that was targeted for elimination by the growing reform movement in the church . Five successive popes ( Leo IX , Victor II , Stephen IX , Nicholas II and Alexander II ) excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury at the same time . It has been suggested by the historian Emma Mason that Edward refused to remove Stigand because this would have undermined the royal prerogative to appoint bishops and archbishops without papal input . Further hurting Stigand 's position , Pope Nicholas II in 1061 declared pluralism to be uncanonical unless approved by the pope . 
 Stigand was later accused of simony by monastic chroniclers , but all such accusations date to after 1066 , and are thus suspect owing to the post @-@ Conquest desire to vilify the English Church as corrupt and backward . The medieval chronicler William of Poitiers also claimed that in 1052 Stigand agreed that William of Normandy , the future William the Conqueror , should succeed King Edward . This claim was used as propaganda after the Conquest , but according to the historian David Bates , among others , it is unlikely to be true . The position of Stigand as head of the church in England was used to good effect by the Normans in their propaganda before , during and after the Conquest . 
 = = = Ecclesiastical affairs = = = 
 The diocese of York took advantage of Stigand 's difficulties with the papacy and encroached on the suffragans , or bishops owing obedience to an archbishop , normally subject to Canterbury . York had long been held in common with Worcester , but during the period when Stigand was excommunicated , the see of York also claimed oversight over the sees of Lichfield and Dorchester . In 1062 , however , papal legates of Alexander II came to England . They did not depose Stigand , and even consulted with him and treated him as archbishop . He was allowed to attend the council they held and was an active participant with the legates in the business of the council . 
 Many of the bishops in England did not want to be consecrated by Stigand . Both <unk> of Wells and Walter of Hereford travelled to Rome to be consecrated by the pope in 1061 , rather than be consecrated by Stigand . During the brief period that he held a legitimate pallium , however , Stigand did consecrate <unk> of Selsey and Siward of Rochester . Abbots of monasteries , however , came to Stigand for consecration throughout his time as archbishop . These included not only abbots from monastic houses inside his province , such as <unk> as abbot of St Augustine 's Abbey in Canterbury , but also Baldwin as Abbot of Bury St. Edmunds and Thurstan as Abbot of Ely . After the Norman Conquest , Stigand was accused of selling the office of abbot , but no abbot was deposed for buying the office , so the charge is suspect . 
 Stigand was probably the most lavish clerical donor of his period , when great men gave to churches on an unprecedented scale . He was a benefactor to the Abbey of Ely , and gave large gold or silver crucifixes to Ely , St Augustine 's Abbey in Canterbury , Bury St. Edmunds Abbey , and to his cathedral church at Winchester . The crucifixes given to Ely , Bury and Winchester all appear to have had about life @-@ size figures of Christ with matching figures of the Virgin and John the Evangelist , as is recorded in the monastic histories , and were probably permanently mounted over the altar or elsewhere . These would have been made with thin sheets of precious metal over a wooden core . No comparably early rood crosses with the side figures of Mary and John seem to survive , though we have large painted wooden crucifixes like the German Gero Cross of around 980 , and the <unk> Santo of Lucca ( renewed with a later figure ) which is known to have inspired <unk> , Abbot of Bury ( d . 1065 ) to create a similar figure , perhaps covered in precious metal , on his return from a visit to Rome . To Ely he gave gold and silver vessels for the altar , and a chasuble embroidered in gold " of such inestimable workmanship and worth , that none in the kingdom is considered richer or more valuable " . Although it does not appear that Stigand ever travelled to Rome , there are indications that Stigand did go on pilgrimage . A 12th @-@ century life of Saint Willibrord , written at the Abbey of Echternach in what is now Luxembourg , records that " to this place also came Stigand , the eminent archbishop of the English " . In the work , Stigand is recorded as giving rich gifts to the abbey as well as relics of saints . 
 = = = Advisor to the king = = = 
 During Edward 's reign , Stigand was an influential advisor at court and used his position to increase his own wealth as well as that of his friends and family . Contemporary valuations of the lands he controlled at the death of King Edward , as listed in Domesday Book , come to an annual income of about 2500 pounds . There is little evidence , however , that he enriched either Canterbury or Winchester . He also appointed his followers to sees within his diocese in 1058 , having Siward named Bishop of Rochester and Æthelric installed as Bishop of Selsey . Between his holding of two sees and the appointment of his men to other sees in the southeast of England , Stigand was an important figure in defending the coastline against invasion . 
 Stigand may have been in charge of the royal administration . He may also have been behind the effort to locate Edward the Atheling and his brother Edmund after 1052 , possibly to secure a more acceptable heir to King Edward . His landholdings were spread across ten counties , and in some of those counties , his lands were larger than the king 's holdings . Although Norman propagandists claimed that as early as 1051 or 1052 King Edward promised the throne of England to Duke William of Normandy , who later became King William the Conqueror , there is little contemporary evidence of such a promise from non @-@ Norman sources . By 1053 , Edward probably realised that he would not have a son from his marriage , and he and his advisors began to search for an heir . Edward the Atheling , the son of King Edmund Ironside ( reigned 1016 ) , had been exiled from England in 1017 , after his father 's death . Although Ealdred , the Bishop of Worcester , went to the Continent in search of Edward the Exile , Ian Walker , the biographer of King Harold Godwinson , feels that Stigand was behind the effort . In the end , although Edward did return to England , he died soon after his return , leaving a young son Edgar the Ætheling .

 = = = Norman Conquest = = = 
 King Edward , on his deathbed , left the crown to his brother @-@ in @-@ law Harold Godwinson , the son of Earl Godwin . Stigand performed the funeral services for Edward . Norman writers claimed that Stigand crowned Harold as king in January 1066 . This is generally considered false propaganda , as it was in William 's interest to portray Harold as uncanonically crowned . If Harold was improperly crowned , then William was merely claiming his rightful inheritance , and not deposing a rightful king . The Bayeux Tapestry depicts Stigand at Harold 's coronation , although not actually placing the crown on Harold 's head . The English sources claim that Ealdred , the Archbishop of York , crowned Harold , while the Norman sources claim that Stigand did so , with the conflict between the various sources probably tracing to the post @-@ Conquest desire to vilify Harold and depict his coronation as improper . Current historical research has shown that the ceremony was performed by Ealdred , owing to the controversy about Stigand 's position . However , one historian , Pauline Stafford , theorises that both archbishops may have consecrated Harold . Another historian , Frank Barlow , writing in 1979 , felt that the fact that some of the English sources do not name who consecrated Harold " tip ( s ) the balance in favour of Stigand " . 
 Stigand did support Harold , and was present at Edward the Confessor 's deathbed . Stigand 's controversial position may have influenced Pope Alexander II 's support of William the Conqueror 's invasion of England . The reformers , led by Archdeacon Hildebrand , later Pope Gregory VII , opposed the older type of bishop , rich and installed by the lay powers . 
 After the death of Harold at the Battle of Hastings , Stigand worked with Earl Edwin and Earl Morcar , as well as Archbishop Ealdred of York , to put Edgar the Ætheling on the throne . This plan did not come to fruition , however , due to opposition from the northern earls and some of the other bishops . Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror at Wallingford in early December 1066 , and perhaps assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day , 1066 , although the coronation was performed by Ealdred . William took Stigand with him to Normandy in 1067 , although whether this was because William did not trust the archbishop , as the medieval chronicler William of Poitiers alleges , is uncertain . Stigand was present at the coronation of William 's queen , Matilda , in 1068 , although once more the ceremony was actually performed by Ealdred . 
 = = = Deposition and death = = = 
 After the first rebellions broke out in late 1067 William adopted a policy of conciliation towards the church . He gave Stigand a place at court , as well as giving administrative positions to Ealdred of York and Æthelwig , Abbot of Evesham . Archbishop Stigand appears on a number of royal charters in 1069 , along with both Norman and English leaders . He even consecrated Remigius de Fécamp as Bishop of <unk> in 1067 . Once the danger of rebellion was past , however , William had no further need of Stigand . At a council held at Winchester at Easter 1070 , the bishops met with papal legates from Alexander II . On 11 April 1070 Stigand was deposed by the papal legate , <unk> , Bishop of Sion in the Alps , and was imprisoned at Winchester . His brother Æthelmær , Bishop of Elmham , was also deposed at the same council . Shortly afterwards <unk> the Bishop of Selsey , <unk> the Bishop of Durham and <unk> Bishop of Lichfield , who was married , were deposed at a council held at Windsor . There were three reasons given for Stigand 's deposition : that he held the bishopric of Winchester in plurality with Canterbury ; that he not only occupied Canterbury after Robert of Jumièges fled but also seized Robert 's pallium which was left behind ; and that he received his own pallium from Benedict X , an anti @-@ pope . Some accounts state that Stigand did appear at the council which deposed him , but nothing is recorded of any defence that he attempted . The charges against his brother are nowhere stated , leading to a belief that the depositions were mainly political . That spring he had deposited his personal wealth at Ely Abbey for safekeeping , but King William confiscated it after his deposition , along with his estates . The king appointed Lanfranc , a native of Italy and a scholar and abbot in Normandy , as the new archbishop . 
 King William appears to have left the initiative for Stigand 's deposition to the papacy , and did nothing to hinder Stigand 's authority until the papal legates arrived in England to depose the archbishop and reform the English Church . Besides witnessing charters and consecrating Remigius , Stigand appears to have been a member of the royal council , and able to move freely about the country . But after the arrival of the legates , William did nothing to protect Stigand from deposition , and the archbishop later accused the king of acting with bad faith . Stigand may even have been surprised that the legates wished him deposed . It was probably the death of Ealdred in 1069 that moved the pope to send the legates , as that left only one archbishop in England ; and he was not considered legitimate and unable to consecrate bishops . The historian George Garnett draws the parallel between the treatment of King Harold in Domesday Book , where he is essentially ignored as king , and Stigand 's treatment after his deposition , where his time as archbishop is as much as possible treated as not occurring . 
 Stigand died in 1072 while still imprisoned , and his death was commemorated on 21 February or 22 February . Sometime between his deposition and his death the widow of King Edward and sister of King Harold , Edith of Wessex , visited him in his imprisonment and allegedly told him to take better care of himself . He was buried in the Old Minster at Westminster . 
 At King Edward 's death , only the royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand . Medieval writers condemned him for his greed and for his pluralism . Hugh the Chanter , a medieval chronicler , claimed that the confiscated wealth of Stigand helped keep King William on the throne . A recent study of his wealth and how it was earned , shows that while he did engage in some exploitative methods to gain some of his wealth , other lands were gained through inheritance or through royal favour . The same study shows little evidence that he despoiled his episcopal estates , although the record towards monastic houses is more suspect . There is no complaint in contemporary records about his private life , and the accusations that he committed simony and was illiterate only date from the 12th century . 
 Although monastic chroniclers after the Norman Conquest accused him of crimes such as perjury and homicide , they do not provide any evidence of those crimes . Almost a 100 years after his death , another Archbishop of Canterbury , Thomas Becket , was taunted in 1164 by King Henry II 's barons with Stigand 's fate for daring to oppose his king . Modern historians views tend to see him as either a wily politician and indifferent bishop , or to see him purely in terms of his ecclesiastical failings . The historian Frank Stenton felt that his " whole career shows that he was essentially a politician " . Concurring with this , the historian Nick Higham said that " Stigand was a seasoned politician whose career had been built on an accurate reading of the balance of power . " Another historian , Eric John , said that " Stigand had a fair claim to be the worst bishop of Christendom " . However , the historian Frank Barlow felt that " he was a man of cultured tastes , a patron of the arts who was generous to the monasteries which he held " . Alexander Rumble argued that Stigand was unlucky in living past the Conquest , stating that it could be said that Stigand was " unlucky to live so long that he saw in his lifetime not only the end of the Anglo @-@ Saxon state but also the challenging of uncanonical , but <unk> tolerated , practices by a wave of papal reforms " .

 = Battle of Arras ( 1917 ) = 
 The Battle of Arras ( also known as the Second Battle of Arras ) was a British offensive on the Western Front during World War I. From 9 April to 16 May 1917 , British troops attacked German defences near the French city of Arras on the Western Front . There were big gains on the first day , followed by stalemate . The battle cost nearly 160 @,@ 000 British and about 125 @,@ 000 German casualties . 
 For much of the war , the opposing armies on the Western Front were at a stalemate , with a continuous line of trenches stretching from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border . The Allied objective from early 1915 was to break through the German defences into the open ground beyond and engage the numerically inferior German Army in a war of movement . The British attack at Arras was part of the French Nivelle Offensive , the main part of which was to take place 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the south . The aim of this combined operation was to end the war in forty @-@ eight hours . At Arras the British were to divert German troops from the French front and to take the German @-@ held high ground that dominated the plain of Douai . 
 The British effort was a relatively broad front assault between Vimy in the north @-@ west and Bullecourt in the south @-@ east . After considerable bombardment , Canadian troops of the First Army in the north fought Battle of Vimy Ridge and captured the ridge . The Third Army in the centre advanced astride the Scarpe River , making the deepest penetration since trench warfare began and in the south , the Fifth Army attacked the Hindenburg Line and was frustrated by the defence in depth , making only minimal gains . The British armies then engaged in a series of small @-@ scale operations to consolidate the new positions . Although these battles were generally successful in achieving limited aims , these were gained at the price of relatively large numbers of casualties . 
 When the battle officially ended on 16 May , British Empire troops had made significant advances but had been unable to achieve a breakthrough . New tactics ( embodied in SS . 135 , Instructions for the Training of Divisions for Offensive Action and <unk> Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action ) and the equipment to exploit them had been used . The platoon had become the principal tactical unit , in four sections : Lewis gun , rifle grenade , bomber and rifle . Artillery creeping barrages , firing shells with the new graze fuze and counter @-@ battery fire had great effect , particularly in the first phase , showing that the British had absorbed the lessons of the Battle of the Somme and could mount set @-@ piece attacks against fortified field defences . The Arras sector then returned to the stalemate that typified most of the war on the Western Front , except for attacks around Lens , culminating in the Canadian Battle of Hill 70 in August . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the beginning of 1917 , the British and French were still searching for a way to achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front . The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Franco – British offensive astride the river Somme , while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916 . Both battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield . Nonetheless , the cost to Germany of containing the Anglo @-@ French attacks had been high , and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917 , Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year . This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders ' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough ; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive , the timing and location were heavily influenced by a number of political and tactical factors . 
 = = = Politics = = = 
 The mid @-@ war years were momentous times . Governing politicians in Paris and London were under great pressure from the press , the people and their parliaments to bring the war to a victorious close . The casualties from the battles of Gallipoli , the Somme and Verdun had been high and there was little prospect of victory in sight . The British prime minister , H. H. Asquith , resigned in early December 1916 and was succeeded by the " Welsh wizard " , David Lloyd George . In France , premier Aristide Briand , along with General ( later Marshal ) Hubert Lyautey as Minister of Defence , were politically diminished and resigned in March 1917 . 
 The United States was close to declaring war on Germany ; American public opinion was growing increasingly incensed by a long succession of high @-@ profile U @-@ boat attacks upon civilian shipping , starting with the sinking of RMS Lusitania in 1915 and culminating in the torpedoing of seven American merchantmen in early 1917 . The United States Congress finally declared war on Imperial Germany on 6 April 1917 , but it would be more than a year before a suitable army could be raised , trained , and transported to France . 
 = = = Strategy = = = 
 Although the French and British had intended to launch a spring offensive in 1917 , the strategy was threatened in February , when the Russians admitted that they could not meet the commitment to a joint offensive , which reduced the two @-@ front offensive to a French assault along the Aisne River . In March , the German army in the west ( <unk> ) , withdrew to the Hindenburg line in Operation Alberich , which negated the tactical assumptions underlying the plans for the French offensive . Until French troops advanced to compensate during the Battles of Arras , they encountered no German troops in the assault sector and it became uncertain whether the offensive would go forward . The French government desperately needed a victory to avoid civil unrest but the British were wary of proceeding , in view of the rapidly changing tactical situation . In a meeting with Lloyd George , French commander @-@ in @-@ chief General Nivelle persuaded the British Prime Minister , that if the British launched a diversionary assault to draw German troops away from the Aisne sector , the French offensive could succeed . It was agreed in the London Convention of 16 January , that the French assault on the Aisne would begin in mid @-@ April and that the British would make a diversionary attack in the Arras sector approximately one week prior . 
 = = = Tactics : British Expeditionary Force = = = 
 Three armies of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig , the commander of the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) were in the Arras sector , the Fifth Army ( General Hubert Gough ) in the south , the Third Army ( General Edmund Allenby ) in the centre and the First Army ( General Henry Horne ) in the north and the plan was devised by Allenby . 
 = = = = Division attack training = = = = 
 In December 1916 , the training manual SS 135 replaced SS 109 of 8 May 1916 and marked a significant step in the evolution of the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) into a homogeneous force , well adapted to its role on the Western Front . The duties of army , corps and divisions in planning attacks were standardised . Armies were to devise the plan and the principles of the artillery component . Corps were to allot tasks to divisions , which would then select objectives and devise infantry plans subject to corps approval . Artillery planning was controlled by corps with consultation of divisions by the corps General Officer Commanding , Royal Artillery ( <unk> ) which became the title of the officer at each level of command who devised the bombardment plan , which was coordinated with neighbouring corps artillery commanders by the army <unk> . Specific parts of the bombardment were nominated by divisions , using their local knowledge and the results of air reconnaissance . The corps artillery commander was to co @-@ ordinate counter @-@ battery fire and the howitzer bombardment for zero hour . Corps controlled the creeping barrage but divisions were given authority over extra batteries added to the barrage , which could be switched to other targets by the divisional commander and brigade commanders . SS 135 provided the basis for the BEF 's operational technique for the rest of 1917 . 
 = = = = Platoon attack training = = = = 
 The training manual SS 143 of February 1917 marked the end of attacks made by lines of infantry with a few detached specialists . The platoon was divided into a small headquarters and four sections , one with two trained grenade @-@ throwers and assistants , the second with a Lewis gunner and nine assistants carrying 30 drums of ammunition , the third section comprised a sniper , scout and nine riflemen and the fourth section had nine men with four rifle @-@ grenade launchers . The rifle and hand @-@ grenade sections were to advance in front of the Lewis @-@ gun and rifle @-@ grenade sections , in two waves or in artillery formation , which covered an area 100 yards ( 91 m ) wide and 50 yards ( 46 m ) deep , with the four sections in a diamond pattern , the rifle section ahead , rifle grenade and bombing sections to the sides and the Lewis gun section behind , until resistance was met . German defenders were to be suppressed by fire from the Lewis @-@ gun and rifle @-@ grenade sections , while the riflemen and hand @-@ grenade sections moved forward , preferably by infiltrating round the flanks of the resistance , to overwhelm the defenders from the rear . 
 The changes in equipment , organisation and formation were elaborated in SS 144 The Normal Formation For the Attack of February 1917 , which recommended that the leading troops should push on to the final objective , when only one or two were involved but that for a greater number of objectives , when artillery covering fire was available for the depth of the intended advance , fresh platoons should " leap @-@ frog " through the leading platoons to the next objective . The new organisations and equipment gave the infantry platoon the capacity for fire and manoeuvre , even in the absence of adequate artillery support . To bring uniformity in adoption of the methods laid down in the revised manuals and others produced over the winter , Haig established a BEF Training Directorate in January 1917 , to issue manuals and oversee training . SS 143 and its companion manuals like SS 144 , provided British infantry with " off @-@ the @-@ peg " tactics , devised from the experience of the Somme and from French Army operations , to go with the new equipment made available by increasing British and Allied war production and better understanding of the organisation necessary to exploit it in battle . 
 = = = Tactics : German army = = = 
 In a new manual of 1 December 1916 , <unk> für die <unk> in der <unk> im <unk> ( Principles of Command for Defensive Battle ) , the policy of unyielding defence of ground regardless of its tactical value , was replaced by the defence of positions suitable for artillery observation and communication with the rear , where an attacking force would " fight itself to a standstill and use up its resources while the defenders conserve [ d ] their strength " . Defending infantry would fight in areas , with the front divisions in an outpost zone up to 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) deep behind listening posts , with the main line of resistance placed on a reverse slope , in front of artillery observation posts , which were kept far enough back to retain observation over the outpost zone . Behind the main line of resistance was a <unk> ( battle zone ) , a second defensive area 1 @,@ 500 – 2 @,@ 500 yards ( 1 @,@ 400 – 2 @,@ 300 m ) deep , also sited as far as possible on ground hidden from enemy observation , while in view of German artillery observers . A <unk> <unk> ( rear battle zone ) further back was to be occupied by the reserve battalion of each regiment . 
 <unk> über <unk> ( Principles of Field Fortification ) was published in January 1917 and by April an outpost zone ( <unk> ) held by sentries , had been built along the Western Front . Sentries could retreat to larger positions ( <unk> ) held by <unk> ( five men and an NCO per Trupp ) , who would join the sentries to recapture sentry @-@ posts by immediate counter @-@ attack . Defensive procedures in the battle zone were similar but with greater numbers . The front trench system was the sentry line for the battle zone garrison , which was allowed to move away from concentrations of enemy fire and then counter @-@ attack to recover the battle and outpost zones ; such withdrawals were envisaged as occurring on small parts of the battlefield which had been made untenable by Allied artillery fire , as the prelude to Gegenstoss in der Stellung ( immediate counter @-@ attack within the position ) . Such a decentralised battle by large numbers of small infantry detachments would present the attacker with unforeseen obstructions . Resistance from troops equipped with automatic weapons , supported by observed artillery fire , would increase the further the advance progressed . A school was opened in January 1917 to teach infantry commanders the new methods . 
 Given the Allies ' growing superiority in munitions and manpower , attackers might still penetrate to the second ( artillery protection ) line , leaving in their wake German garrisons isolated in <unk> , ( resistance nests , Widas ) still inflicting losses and disorganisation on the attackers . As the attackers tried to capture the Widas and dig in near the German second line , <unk> and <unk> of the counter @-@ attack divisions would advance from the <unk> <unk> into the battle zone , in an immediate counter @-@ attack , ( Gegenstoss aus der <unk> ) . If the immediate counter @-@ attack failed , the counter @-@ attack divisions would take their time to prepare a methodical attack , provided the lost ground was essential to the retention of the main position . Such methods required large numbers of reserve divisions ready to move to the battlefront . The reserve was obtained by creating 22 divisions by internal reorganisation of the army , bringing divisions from the eastern front and by shortening the western front , in Operation Alberich . By the spring of 1917 , the German army in the west had a strategic reserve of 40 divisions .

 Experience of the German 1st Army in the Somme Battles , ( <unk> der I Armee in der <unk> ) was published on 30 January 1917 . Ludendorff 's new defensive methods had been controversial ; during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 Colonel Fritz von Loßberg ( Chief of Staff of the First Army ) had been able to establish a line of relief divisions ( Ablösungsdivisionen ) , with the reinforcements from Verdun , which began to arrive in greater numbers in September . In his analysis of the battle , Fritz von Loßberg opposed the granting of discretion to front trench garrisons to retire , as he believed that manoeuvre did not allow the garrisons to evade Allied artillery fire , which could blanket the forward area and invited enemy infantry to occupy vacant areas . Loßberg considered that spontaneous withdrawals would disrupt the counter @-@ attack reserves as they deployed and further deprive battalion and division commanders of the ability to conduct an organised defence , which the dispersal of infantry over a wider area had already made difficult . Loßberg and others had severe doubts as to the ability of relief divisions to arrive on the battlefield in time to conduct an immediate counter @-@ attack ( Gegenstoss ) from behind the battle zone . The sceptics wanted the Somme practice of fighting in the front line to be retained and authority devolved no further than battalion , so as to maintain organizational coherence , in anticipation of a methodical counter @-@ attack ( <unk> ) after 24 – 48 hours , by the relief divisions . Ludendorff was sufficiently impressed by Loßberg 's memorandum to add it to the new Manual of Infantry Training for War . 
 General Falkenhausen , commander of the 6th Army arranged his infantry in the Arras area according to Loßberg and Hoen 's preference for a rigid defence of the front @-@ line , supported by methodical counter @-@ attacks ( <unk> ) , by the " relief " divisions ( Ablösungsdivisionen ) on the second or third day . Five Ablösungsdivisionen were placed behind Douai , 15 miles ( 24 km ) away from the front line . The new Hindenburg line ended at Telegraph Hill between Neuville @-@ Vitasse and Tilloy lez Mofflaines , from whence the original system of four lines 75 – 150 yards ( 69 – 137 m ) apart , ran north to the Neuville St. Vaast – Bailleul road . About 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) behind , were the Wancourt – Feuchy and to the north the Point du Jour lines , running from the Scarpe river north along the east slope of Vimy ridge . The new Wotan line , which extended the Hindenburg position , was built around 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) further back and not entirely mapped by the Allies until the battle had begun . 
 Just before the battle , Falkenhausen had written that parts of the front line might be lost but the five <unk> could be brought forward to relieve the front divisions , on the evening of the second day . On 6 April , General von Nagel , the 6th Army Chief of Staff , accepted that some of the front divisions might need to be relieved on the first evening of battle but that any penetrations would be repulsed with local immediate counter @-@ attacks ( <unk> in der Stellung ) by the front divisions . On 7 April , Nagel viewed the imminent British attack as a limited effort against Vimy ridge , preparatory to a bigger attack later , perhaps combined with the French attack expected in mid @-@ April . Construction of positions to fulfil the new policy of area defence , had been drastically curtailed by shortages of labour and the long winter , which affected the setting of concrete . The 6th Army commanders had also been reluctant to encourage the British to change their plans , if they detected a thinning of the front line and were inhibited by the extent of British air reconnaissance , which observed new field works and promptly directed artillery fire on them . The 6th Army failed to redeploy its artillery , which remained in lines easy to see and bombard . Work on defences was also divided between maintaining the front line , strengthening the third line and the new <unk> ( <unk> – Quéant switch line ) further back . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The British plan was well developed , drawing on the lessons of the Somme and Verdun the previous year . Rather than attacking on an extended front , the full weight of artillery would be concentrated on a relatively narrow stretch of 11 mi ( 18 km ) , from Vimy Ridge in the north to Neuville Vitasse , 4 mi ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) south of the Scarpe river . The bombardment was planned to last about a week at all points on the line , with a much longer and heavier barrage at Vimy to weaken its strong defences . During the assault , the troops would advance in open formation , with units leapfrogging each other to allow them time to consolidate and regroup . Before the action could be undertaken , a great deal of preparation was required , much of it innovative . 
 = = = War underground = = = 
 Since October 1916 , Royal Engineer tunnelling companies had been working on the Western Front . The Artois region is chalky and easily excavated and under the city of Arras , there is a vast network of <unk> ( caverns , underground quarries , galleries and sewage tunnels ) . The Third Army at Arras planned to use the old underground quarries in the city in the offensive planned for April 1917 . The quarries were to be linked by tunnels so that they could be used as shelters against German artillery @-@ fire and to convey troops to the front in secrecy and safety . Assault tunnels were also dug , stopping a few metres short of the German line , ready to be blown open by explosives on Zero @-@ Day . Conventional mines were laid under the German front line , ready to be blown immediately before the assault . ( Many were never detonated for fear that they would churn up the ground too much . ) German sappers ( military engineers ) also conducted underground operations , seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and counter @-@ mine . 
 Of the New Zealand tunnellers , 41 were killed and 151 were wounded by German counter @-@ mining . The tunnelling effort was enormous and in one sector , four Tunnelling companies of 500 men each , worked around @-@ the @-@ clock in 18 @-@ hour shifts for two months . The tunnellers dug 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) of subways ( foot traffic only ) , tramways ( with rails for hand @-@ drawn trolleys , to take ammunition to the line and bring casualties back ) and railways ( a light railway system ) . Just before the assault , the tunnel system had been enlarged sufficient to conceal 24 @,@ 000 men , with electric lighting provided by a small powerhouse , kitchens , latrines and a medical centre with an operating theatre . The bulk of the work was done by the New Zealand Tunnelling Company , which included Maori and Pacific Islanders from the New Zealand Pioneer battalion and Bantams from the coalfields of northern England . 
 = = = War in the air = = = 
 Although the Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) entered the Battle with inferior aircraft to the Luftstreitkräfte , this did not deter their commander , General Trenchard , from adopting an offensive posture . Dominance of the air over Arras was essential for reconnaissance and the British carried out many aerial patrols . Trenchard 's aircraft , acting in support of ground forces , carried out artillery spotting , photography of trench systems and bombing . The reconnaissance activities were coordinated by the 1st Field Survey Company , Royal Engineers . Aerial observation was hazardous work as , for best results , the aircraft had to fly at slow speeds and low altitude over the German defences . It became even more dangerous with the arrival of the " Red Baron " , Manfred von Richthofen , with his highly experienced and better @-@ equipped Jagdgeschwader 1 ( Richthofen 's Flying Circus ) in March 1917 . Its deployment led to sharply increased losses of Allied pilots and April 1917 was to become known as Bloody April . One German infantry officer later wrote " during these days , there was a whole series of dogfights , which almost invariably ended in defeat for the British since it was Richthofen 's squadron they were up against . Often five or six planes in succession would be chased away or shot down in flames " . The average flying life of a RFC pilot in Arras in April was 18 hours . Between 4 and 8 April , the RFC lost 75 aircraft and 105 aircrew on operations . The casualties created a pilot shortage and replacements were sent to the front straight from flying school : during the same period , 56 aircraft were crashed by inexperienced RFC pilots . 
 = = = Creeping barrage = = = 
 To keep enemy action to a minimum during the assault , a " creeping barrage " was planned . This required gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines , about one hundred metres in advance of the assaulting troops . The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the battles of Neuve Chapelle and the Somme but had encountered two technical problems . The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage : for Arras , this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling . The second was the barrage falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire : for Arras , the rate of wear of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly . While there was a risk of friendly fire , the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters , allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire . The new No. 106 instantaneous fuze had been adapted from a French design for high @-@ explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact , <unk> barbed wire . Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the barrage . 
 = = = Counter @-@ battery fire = = = 
 The principal danger to assaulting troops came from enemy artillery fire as they crossed no man 's land , accounting for over half the casualties at the first day of the Somme . A further complication was the location of German artillery , hidden as it was behind the ridges . In response , specialist artillery units were created to attack German artillery . Their targets were provided by 1st Field Survey Company , Royal Engineers , who collated data obtained from " flash spotting " and sound ranging . ( Flash spotting required Royal Flying Corps observers to record the location of tell @-@ tale flashes made by guns whilst firing . ) On Zero @-@ Day , 9 April , over 80 percent of German heavy guns in the sector were neutralised ( that is , " unable to bring effective fire to bear , the crews being disabled or driven off " ) by counter @-@ battery fire . Gas shells were also used against the draught horses of the batteries and to disrupt ammunition supply columns . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = First phase = = = 
 The preliminary bombardment of Vimy Ridge started on 20 March ; and the bombardment of the rest of the sector on 4 April . Limited to a front of only 24 miles ( 39 km ) , the bombardment used 2 @,@ 689 @,@ 000 shells , over a million more than had been used on the Somme . German casualties were not heavy but the men became exhausted by the endless task of keeping open dug @-@ out entrances and demoralised by the absence of rations caused by the difficulties of preparing and moving hot food under bombardment . Some went without food altogether for two or three consecutive days . 
 By the eve of battle , the front @-@ line trenches had ceased to exist and their barbed wire defences were blown to pieces . The official history of the 2nd Bavarian Reserve Regiment describes the front line as " consisting no longer of trenches but of advanced nests of men scattered about " . The <unk> Reserve Regiment history writes that its trench system was " lost in a crater field " . To add to the misery , for the last ten hours of bombardment , gas shells were added . 
 Zero @-@ Hour had originally been planned for the morning of 8 April ( Easter Sunday ) but it was postponed 24 hours at the request of the French , despite reasonably good weather in the assault sector . Zero @-@ Day was rescheduled for 9 April with Zero @-@ Hour at 05 : 30 . The assault was preceded by a hurricane bombardment lasting five minutes , following a relatively quiet night . 
 When the time came , it was snowing heavily ; Allied troops advancing across no man 's land were hindered by large drifts . It was still dark and visibility on the battlefield was very poor . A westerly wind was at the Allied soldiers ' backs blowing " a squall of sleet and snow into the faces of the Germans " . The combination of the unusual bombardment and poor visibility meant many German troops were caught unawares and taken prisoner , still half @-@ dressed , clambering out of the deep dug @-@ outs of the first two lines of trenches . Others were captured without their boots , trying to escape but stuck in the knee @-@ deep mud of the communication trenches . 
 = = = = First Battle of the Scarpe ( 9 – 14 April 1917 ) = = = = 
 The major British assault of the first day was directly east of Arras , with the 12th Division attacking Observation Ridge , north of the Arras — Cambrai road . After reaching this objective , they were to push on towards Feuchy , as well as the second and third lines of German trenches . At the same time , elements of the 3rd Division began an assault south of the road , with the taking of Devil 's Wood , Tilloy @-@ lès @-@ Mofflaines and the Bois des Boeufs as their initial objectives . The ultimate objective of these assaults was the <unk> , a trench running between Wancourt and Feuchy , and an important component of the German defences . Most of these objectives , including Feuchy village , had been achieved by the evening of 10 April though the Germans were still in control of large sections of the trenches between Wancourt and Feuchy , particularly in the area of the heavily fortified village of Neuville @-@ Vitasse . The following day , troops from the 56th Division were able to force the Germans out of the village , although the <unk> was not fully in British hands until a few days later . The British were able to consolidate these gains and push forward towards Monchy @-@ le @-@ Preux , although they suffered heavy casualties in fighting near the village . 
 One reason for the success of the offensive in this sector was the failure of German commander von Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth . In theory , the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains , thus stretching their lines of communication . Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down , before enemy reinforcements could be brought up . The defenders would thus be able to counter @-@ attack and regain any lost territory . In this sector , Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were too late for a useful counter @-@ attack on either 10 or 11 April . 
 = = = = Battle of Vimy Ridge ( 9 – 12 April 1917 ) = = = = 
 At roughly the same time , in perhaps the most carefully crafted portion of the entire offensive , the Canadian Corps launched an assault on Vimy Ridge . Advancing behind a creeping barrage , and making heavy use of machine guns – eighty to each brigade , including one Lewis gun in each platoon – the corps was able to advance through about 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) of German defences , and captured the crest of the ridge at about 13 : 00 . Military historians have attributed the success of this attack to careful planning by Canadian Corps commander Julian Byng and his subordinate General Arthur Currie , constant training , and the assignment of specific objectives to each platoon . By giving units specific goals , troops could continue the attack even if their officers were killed or communication broke down , thus bypassing two major problems of combat on the Western Front . 
 = = = Second phase = = = 
 After the territorial gains of the first two days , a hiatus followed as the immense logistical support needed to keep armies in the field caught up with the new realities . Battalions of pioneers built temporary roads across the churned up battlefield ; heavy artillery ( and its ammunition ) was manhandled into position in new gun pits ; food for the men and feed for the draught horses was brought up , and casualty clearing stations were established in readiness for the inevitable counter @-@ attacks . Allied commanders also faced a dilemma : whether to keep their exhausted divisions on the attack and run the risk of having insufficient manpower or replace them with fresh divisions and lose momentum . 
 In London , The Times commented : " the great value of our recent advance here lies in the fact that we have everywhere driven the enemy from high ground and robbed him of observation . [ H ] aving secured these high seats [ Vimy , Monchy and <unk> ] and enthroned ourselves , it is not necessarily easy to continue the rapid advance . An attack down the forward slope of high ground , exposed to the fire of lesser slopes beyond , is often extremely difficult and now on the general front ... there must intervene a laborious period , with which we were familiar at the Somme , of systemic hammering and storming of individual positions , no one of which can be attacked until some covering one has been captured " . 
 The German press reacted similarly . The Vossische Zeitung , a Berlin daily newspaper , wrote : " We have to count on reverses like that near Arras . Such events are a kind of tactical reverse . If this tactical reverse is not followed by strategical effects i.e. , breaking through on the part of the aggressor , then the whole battle is nothing but a weakening of the attacked party in men and materiel . " The same day , the Frankfurter Zeitung commented : " If the British succeed in breaking through it will render conditions worse for them as it will result in freedom of operations which is Germany 's own special art of war " . 
 General Ludendorff was less sanguine . The news of the battle reached him during his 52nd birthday celebrations at his headquarters in Kreuznach . He wrote : " I had looked forward to the expected offensive with confidence and was now deeply depressed " . He telephoned each of his commanders and " gained the impression that the principles laid down by OHL were sound but the whole art of leadership lies in applying them correctly " . ( A later court of inquiry would establish that Falkenhausen had indeed misunderstood the principles of defence in depth . ) Ludendorff immediately ordered reinforcements . Then , on 11 April , he sacked General von Falkenhausen 's chief of staff and replaced him with his defensive line expert , Colonel Fritz von Lossberg . Von Lossberg went armed with a <unk> ( a power of attorney enabling him to issue orders in Ludendorff 's name ) , effectively replacing Falkenhausen . Within hours of arriving , Lossberg was restructuring the German defences . 
 During the Second Phase , the Allies continued to press the attack east of Arras . Their aims were to consolidate the gains made in the first days of the offensive ; to keep the initiative and to break through in concert with the French at Aisne . However , from 16 April onwards , it was apparent that the Nivelle Offensive was failing and Haig came under pressure to keep the Germans occupied in the Arras sector to minimise French losses .

 At 04 : 45 on 23 April , following two days of poor visibility and freezing weather , British troops of the Third Army ( VI and VII corps ) , attacked to the east along an approximate 9 mi ( 14 km ) front from <unk> to Gavrelle on both sides of the Scarpe . The 51st Division attacked on the northern side in heavy fighting on the western outskirts of Roeux Wood and the chemical works . On their left , the 37th Division , attacked the buildings west of Roeux Station and gained the line of their objectives on the western slopes of Greenland Hill , north of the railway . On the left of the main British attack the 63rd Division , made rapid progress against Gavrelle and secured the village . To the south of the Scarpe and east of Monchy @-@ le @-@ Preux the 29th Division gained the western slopes of the rising ground known as Infantry Hill . The <unk> river marked a divisional boundary within the VI Corps . <unk> on the north side of the river was the objective of the 15th Division , attacking east from Wancourt towards Vis @-@ en @-@ Artois . The objective was commanded by the higher ground on the south bank and it was not until the 50th Division captured the rise on the south side of the <unk> that the village was taken . Several determined German counter @-@ attacks were made and by the morning of 24 April , the British held <unk> , Gavrelle and the high ground overlooking Fontaine @-@ lez @-@ <unk> and <unk> ; the fighting around Roeux was indecisive . 
 = = = = Battle of Arleux ( 28 – 29 April 1917 ) = = = = 
 The principal objective of the attack was the need to sustain a supporting action tying down German reserves to assist the French offensive against the plateau north of the Aisne traversed by the Chemin des Dames . Haig reported , " With a view to economising my troops , my objectives were shallow , and for a like reason , and also in order to give the appearance of an attack on a more imposing scale , demonstrations were continued southwards to the Arras @-@ Cambrai Road and northwards to the Souchez River " . 
 At 04 : 25 on April 28 British and Canadian troops launched the main attack on a front of about eight miles north of Monchy @-@ le @-@ Preux . A fierce battle continued throughout the greater part of the 28 and 29 April . The Germans delivered determined and repeated counter @-@ attacks . The British positions at Gavrelle alone were attacked seven times with strong forces , and on each occasion the German thrust was repulsed with great loss by the 63rd Division . The village of Arleux @-@ en @-@ Gohelle was captured by Canadian troops , ( 1st Canadian Division ) , after bitter hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting , and British troops , ( 2nd Division , Major @-@ General C. E. Pereira ) , made further progress in the neighbourhood of Oppy , on Greenland Hill ( 37th Division ) , and between Monchy @-@ le @-@ Preux and the Scarpe ( 12th Division ) .

 After securing the area around Arleux at the end of April , the British determined to launch another attack east from Monchy to try to break through the <unk> Riegel and reach the <unk> , a major German defensive fortification . This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt to present the Germans with a two – pronged assault . British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east . With this objective in mind , the British launched another attack near the Scarpe on 3 May . However , neither prong was able to make any significant advances and the attack was called off the following day after incurring heavy casualties . Although this battle was a failure , the British learned important lessons about the need for close liaison between tanks , infantry , and artillery , which they would later apply in the Battle of Cambrai ( 1917 ) .

 South of Arras , the plan called for two divisions , the British 62nd Division and the Australian 4th Division to attack either side of the village of Bullecourt and push the Germans out of their fortified positions and into the reserve trenches . The attack was initially scheduled for the morning of 10 April , but the tanks intended for the assault were delayed by bad weather and the attack was postponed for 24 hours . The order to delay did not reach all units in time , and two battalions of the West Yorkshire Regiment attacked and were driven back with significant losses . Despite protests from the Australian commanders , the attack was resumed on the morning of 11 April ; mechanical failures meant that only 11 tanks were able to advance in support , and the limited artillery barrage left much of the barbed wire in front of the German trenches uncut . Additionally , the abortive attack of the previous day alerted German troops in the area to the impending assault , and they were better prepared than they had been in the Canadian sector . Misleading reports about the extent of the gains made by the Australians deprived them of necessary artillery support and , although elements of the 4th Division briefly occupied sections of German trenches , they were ultimately forced to retreat with heavy losses . In this sector , the German commanders correctly employed the elastic defence and were therefore able to counter @-@ attack effectively . The Germans acquired two of the tanks which had been used , and after seeing them perforated by armour @-@ piercing bullets , believed the rifle A.P. bullet was an effective anti @-@ tank weapon , which threw them off @-@ guard .

 Observing that the 1st Australian Division was holding a frontage of 13 @,@ 000 yd ( 12 @,@ 000 m ) , the local German corps commander ( General Otto von Moser , commanding the German XIV Reserve Corps ) planned a spoiling attack to drive back the advanced posts , destroy supplies and guns and then retire to the Hindenburg defences . Passing his plans to higher command , they assigned an extra division to his corps to further strengthen the attack . Attacking with 23 battalions ( from four divisions ) , the German forces managed to penetrate the Australian front line at the junction on the 1st Australian Division and 2nd Australian Division and occupy the village of Lagnicourt ( damaging some Australian artillery pieces ) . Counter @-@ attacks from the Australian 9th and 20th Australian battalions , restored the front line , and the action ended with the Australians suffering 1 @,@ 010 casualties , against 2 @,@ 313 German casualties .

 After the initial assault around Bullecourt failed to penetrate the German lines , British commanders made preparations for a second attempt . British artillery began an intense bombardment of the village , which by 20 April had been virtually destroyed . Although the infantry assault was planned for 20 April , it was pushed back a number of times and finally set for the early morning of 3 May . At 03 : 45 , elements of the 2nd Australian Division attacked east of Bullecourt village , intending to pierce the Hindenburg Line and capture Hendecourt @-@ lès @-@ <unk> , while British troops from the 62nd ( 2nd West Riding ) Division attacked Bullecourt , which was finally taken by the British 7th Division and despite determined effort by the Germans was held by the British 62nd Division . German resistance was fierce and when the offensive was called off on 17 May , few of the initial objectives had been met . The Australians were in possession of much of the German trench system between Bullecourt and <unk> @-@ lès @-@ <unk> but had been unable to capture Hendecourt . To the west , British troops managed to push the Germans out of Bullecourt but incurred considerable losses , failing also to advance north @-@ east to Hendecourt .

 By the standards of the Western front , the gains of the first two days were nothing short of spectacular . A great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties and a number of strategically significant points were captured , notably Vimy Ridge . Additionally , the offensive succeeded in drawing German troops away from the French offensive in the Aisne sector . In many respects , the battle might be deemed a victory for the British and their allies but these gains were offset by high casualties and the ultimate failure of the French offensive at the Aisne . By the end of the offensive , the British had suffered more than 150 @,@ 000 casualties and gained little ground since the first day . Despite significant early gains , they were unable to effect a breakthrough and the situation reverted to stalemate . Although historians generally consider the battle a British victory , in the wider context of the front , it had very little impact on the strategic or tactical situation . Ludendorff later commented : " no doubt exceedingly important strategic objects lay behind the British attack , but I have never been able to discover what they were " . In contradiction to this he was also " very depressed ; had our principles of defensive tactics proved false , and if so , what was to be done ? " 
 On the Allied side , twenty @-@ five Victoria Crosses were subsequently awarded . On the German side , on 24 April 1917 , Kaiser Wilhelm awarded Von Lossberg the Oakleaves ( similar to a bar for a repeat award ) for the Pour le Mérite he had received at the Battle of the Somme the previous September .

Captain Cyril Falls ( the writer of that part of the History of the Great War , the British official history , describing the Battles of Arras , Military Operations 1917 volume I ) estimated that 30 % needed to be added to German returns for comparison with the British .

 Although Haig paid tribute to Allenby for the plan 's " great initial success " , Allenby 's subordinates " objected to the way he handled the ... attritional stage " . Allenby was sent to command the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Palestine . He regarded the transfer as a " badge of failure " but he " more than redeemed his reputation by defeating " the Ottomans in 1917 – 18 . Haig stayed in his post until the end of the war . 
 When it became apparent that a factor in the British success were the failures of the 6th Army command , Ludendorff removed the commander , General von Falkenhausen ( who never held a field command again , spending the rest of war as Governor @-@ General of Belgium ) and several staff officers . In early 1918 , The Times carried an article , Falkenhausen 's Reign of Terror , describing 170 military executions of Belgian civilians since he had been appointed governor . 
 Ludendorff and Lossberg discovered that although the Allies were capable of breaking through the first position they could probably not capitalise on their success if they were confronted by a mobile , clever defence . Ludendorff immediately ordered more training in manoeuvre warfare for his Eingreif divisions . Lossberg was soon promoted to general and directed the defensive battle of the 4th Army against the British Flanders offensive of the summer and late autumn . ( Lossberg had become " legendary as the fireman of the Western Front ; always sent by OHL to the area of crisis " ) .

 During a match with Mr. Kennedy on the October 1 , 2007 episode of Raw , Cena suffered a legitimate torn pectoral muscle while executing a hip toss . Though finishing the match and taking part in the scripted attack by Randy Orton after the match , surgery the following day found that his pectoralis major muscle was torn completely from the bone , estimating at the time to require seven months to a year of rehabilitation . As a result , Cena was stripped of the title by Mr. McMahon on the next night 's episode of ECW , ending what was the longest WWE Championship reign in over 19 years . Cena 's surgery was performed by orthopedic surgeon James Andrews at St. Vincent 's Hospital in Birmingham , Alabama . Two weeks later , in a video update on WWE.com , Dr. Andrews and Cena 's physical trainer both said that he was several weeks ahead of where he was expected to be in his rehabilitation at that time . Despite his injury , Cena attended the annual WWE 's Tribute to the Troops show filmed at Camp Speicher in Tikrit , Iraq on December 7 , and aired on December 24 .
