 The Monaco Grand Prix is organized each year by the Automobile Club de Monaco which also runs the Monte Carlo Rally and the Junior Monaco Kart Cup . 
 It differs in several ways from other Grands Prix . The practice session for the race is held on the Thursday preceding the race instead of Friday . This allows the streets to be opened to the public again on Friday . Until the late 1990s the race started at 3 : 30 p.m. local time – an hour and a half later than other European Formula One races . In recent years the race has fallen in line with the other Formula One races for the convenience of television viewers . Also , earlier the event was traditionally held on the week of Ascension Day . It is now held on what is Memorial Day Weekend in the United States . For many years , the numbers of cars admitted to Grands Prix was at the discretion of the race organisers – Monaco had the smallest grids , ostensibly because of its narrow and twisting track . Only 18 cars were permitted to enter the 1975 Monaco Grand Prix , compared to 23 to 26 cars at all other rounds that year . 
 The erecting of the circuit takes six weeks , and the removal after the race takes three weeks . There is no podium as such at the race . Instead a section of the track is closed after the race to act as parc fermé , a place where the cars are held for official inspection . The first three drivers in the race leave their cars there and walk directly to the royal box where the ' podium ' ceremony is held , which is considered a custom for the race . The trophies are handed out before the national anthems ' of the driver and team are played , as opposed to other Grands Prix where the anthems are played first .

 The Monaco Grand Prix is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world alongside the Indianapolis 500 @-@ Mile Race and the 24 Hours of Le Mans . These three races are considered to form a Triple Crown of the three most famous motor races in the world . Graham Hill is the only driver to have won the Triple Crown , by winning all three races . The practice session for Monaco overlaps with that for the Indianapolis 500 , and the races themselves sometimes clash . As the two races take place on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean and form part of different championships , it is difficult for one driver to compete effectively in both during his career . Juan Pablo Montoya , who won the Monaco Grand Prix in 2003 and the Indianapolis 500 in 2000 and 2015 , is the only driver still racing in 2015 who has won two of the three races and thus is the closest to completing the Triple Crown . 
 In awarding its first Gold medal for motor sport to Prince Rainier III , the Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile ( FIA ) characterised the Monaco Grand Prix as contributing " an exceptional location of glamour and prestige " to motor sport . It has been run under the patronage of three generations of Monaco 's royal family : Louis II , Rainier III and Albert II , all of whom have taken a close interest in the race . A large part of the principality 's income comes from tourists attracted by the warm climate and the famous casino , but it is also a tax haven and is home to many millionaires , including several Formula One drivers . 
 Monaco has produced only three native Formula One drivers , Louis Chiron , André <unk> and Olivier Beretta , but its tax status has made it home to many drivers over the years , including Gilles Villeneuve and Ayrton Senna . Of the 2006 Formula One contenders , several have property in the principality , including Jenson Button and David Coulthard , who was part owner of a hotel there . Because of the small size of the town and the location of the circuit , drivers whose races end early can usually get back to their apartments in minutes . Ayrton Senna famously retired to his apartment after crashing out of the lead of the 1988 race .

 Florida International University ( FIU ) is an American metropolitan public research university located in Greater Miami , Florida , United States . FIU has two major campuses in Miami @-@ Dade County , with its main campus in University Park . Florida International University is classified as a " tier @-@ one " research university with highest research activity by the Carnegie Foundation and a first @-@ tier research university by the Florida Legislature . Founded in 1965 , FIU is the youngest university to be awarded a Phi Beta Kappa chapter by the Phi Beta Kappa Society , the country 's oldest academic honor society . 
 FIU belongs to the 12 @-@ campus State University System of Florida and is one of Florida 's primary graduate research universities , awarding over 3 @,@ 400 graduate and professional degrees annually . The university offers 191 programs of study with more than 280 majors in 23 colleges and schools . FIU offers many graduate programs , including architecture , business administration , engineering , law , and medicine , offering 81 master 's degrees , 34 doctoral degrees , and 3 professional degrees . 
 FIU is the largest university in South Florida , the 2nd @-@ largest in Florida , and the 4th @-@ largest in the United States . Total enrollment in 2014 @-@ 2015 was 54 @,@ 099 students , including 7 @,@ 814 graduate students . According to U.S. News college rankings and reviews , 92 % of FIU students live off @-@ campus while only 8 % of students live in " college @-@ owned , college @-@ operated or college @-@ affiliated " housing . 
 Since 2007 , more valedictorians from South Florida choose to attend FIU than any other university in the country . As Miami 's public research university , competition to enroll at FIU has heightened as more students apply each year . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Founding : 1943 – 69 = = = 
 The story of Florida International University 's founding began in 1943 , when state Senator Ernest ' Cap ' Graham ( father of future Florida governor and U.S. senator Bob Graham ) presented the state legislature with the initial proposal for the establishment of a public university in South Florida . While his bill did not pass , Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues , advising them of Miami 's need for a state university . He felt the establishment of a public university was necessary to serve the city 's growing population . 
 In 1964 , Senate Bill 711 was introduced by Florida Senator Robert M. Haverfield . It instructed the state Board of Education and the Board of Regents ( BOR ) , to begin planning for the development of a state university in Miami . The bill was signed into law by then @-@ governor W. Haydon Burns in June 1965 , marking FIU 's official founding . 
 FIU 's founding president Charles " Chuck " Perry was appointed by the Board of Regents in July 1969 after a nationwide search . At 32 years old , the new president was the youngest in the history of the State University System and , at the time , the youngest university president in the country . Perry recruited three co @-@ founders , Butler Waugh , Donald McDowell and Nick Sileo . Alvah Chapman , Jr . , former Miami Herald publisher and Knight Ridder chairman , used his civic standing and media power to assist the effort . In the 1980s , Chapman became chair of the FIU Foundation Board of Trustees . 
 The founders located the campus on the site of the original Tamiami Airport on the Tamiami Trail ( U.S. Route 41 ) between Southwest 107th and 117th Avenues , just east of where the West Dade Expressway ( now the Homestead Extension of Florida 's Turnpike ) was being planned . The abandoned airport 's air traffic control tower became FIU 's first building . It originally had no telephones , no drinking water , and no furniture . Perry decided that the tower should never be destroyed , and it remains on campus , where it is now known variously as the " Ivory Tower , " the " Tower Building , " or the " Public Safety Tower , " and is the former location of the FIU Police Department . 
 = = = Opening of the doors : 1969 – 75 = = = 
 In September 1972 , 5 @,@ 667 students entered the new state university , the largest opening day enrollment at the time . Previously , Miami had been the largest city in the country lacking a public baccalaureate @-@ granting institution . Eighty percent of the student body had just graduated from Dade County Junior College ( now Miami @-@ Dade College ) . A typical student entering FIU was 25 years old and attending school full @-@ time while holding down a full @-@ time job . Forty @-@ three percent were married . Negotiations with the University of Miami and Dade County Junior College led FIU to open as an upper @-@ division only school . It would be 9 years before lower @-@ division classes were added . 
 The first commencement , held in June 1973 , took place in the reading room of the ground floor of Primera Casa – the only place large enough on campus for the ceremony . More than 1 @,@ 500 family members and friends watched FIU 's first class of 191 graduates receive their diplomas . 
 By late 1975 , after seven years at the helm , Charles Perry felt he had accomplished his goal and left the University to become president and publisher of the Sunday newspaper magazine Family Weekly ( now USA Weekend ) , one of the country 's largest magazines . When he left , there were more than 10 @,@ 000 students attending classes and a campus with five major buildings and a sixth being planned . 
 = = = Crosby and Wolfe : 1976 – 86 = = = 
 Harold Crosby , the University 's second president and the founding president of the University of West Florida in Pensacola , agreed in 1976 to serve a three @-@ year " interim " term . Under his leadership , FIU 's North Miami Campus ( which was officially renamed the Bay Vista Campus in 1980 , the North Miami Campus in 1987 , the North Campus in 1994 , and the Biscayne Bay Campus in 2000 ) – located on the former <unk> site on Biscayne Bay – was opened in 1977 . State Senator Jack Gordon was instrumental in securing funding for the development of the campus . President Crosby emphasized the university 's international character , prompting the launching of new programs with an international focus and the recruitment of faculty from the Caribbean and Latin America . President Crosby 's resignation in January 1979 triggered the search for a " permanent " president . 
 Gregory Baker Wolfe , a former United States diplomat and then @-@ president of Portland State University became FIU 's third president , from 1979 to 1986 . After stepping down as president , Wolfe taught in the university 's international relations department . The student union on the Biscayne Bay Campus is named in his honor . 
 = = = Maidique : 1986 – 2009 = = = 
 Cuban born Modesto A. Maidique assumed the presidency at FIU in 1986 , becoming the fourth in the university 's history . Maidique graduated with a Bachelor of Science , Master of Science , and PhD in Electrical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , before joining the private sector . He held academic appointments from MIT , Harvard and Stanford Universities , and has been named to several US Presidential boards and committees . 
 Under his leadership , FIU heralded in an era of unprecedented growth and prestige with all facets of university undergoing major transformations . Physically , the university tripled in size and its enrollment grew to nearly 40 @,@ 000 . During his 23 years as president , the school established the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine , the FIU College of Law , the FIU School of Architecture and the Robert Stempel School of Public Health . Also during his tenure , endowment grew from less than $ 2 million to over $ 100 million . 
 During Maidique 's tenure , the university added 22 new doctoral programs . Research expenditures grew from about $ 6 million to nearly $ 110 million as defined by the National Science Foundation . In 2000 , FIU attained the highest ranking in the Carnegie Foundation classification system , that of " Doctoral / Research University @-@ Extensive . " FIU 's faculty has engaged in research and holds far @-@ reaching expertise in reducing morbidity and mortality from cancer , HIV / AIDS , substance abuse , diabetes and other diseases , and change the approaches to the delivery of health care by medical , public health , nursing and other healthcare professionals , hurricane mitigation , climate change , nano @-@ technologies , forensic sciences , and the development of biomedical devices . 
 The arts also flourished while Maidique was at the helm , with the university acquiring The Wolfsonian @-@ FIU Museum on Miami Beach and building the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum on its main campus . In athletics , FIU made inroads in becoming a powerhouse athletic university during Maidique 's time as president and he championed the eventual establishment of a NCAA football program . Finally , the school earned membership into Phi Beta Kappa , the nation 's oldest honor society . 
 Maidique was the second longest @-@ serving research university president in the nation . Now President Emeritus , he currently serves as the Alvah H. Chapman , Jr . , Eminent Scholar Chair in Leadership and Executive Director of the Center for Leadership and Professor of Management at FIU . 
 = = = Recent history = = = 
 On November 14 , 2008 , Maidique announced that he would be stepping down and asked FIU 's Board of Trustees to begin the search of a new president . He said he would remain president until a new one was found . On April 25 , 2009 , Mark B. Rosenberg was selected to become FIU 's fifth president . He signed a five @-@ year contract with the Board of Trustees . On August 29 , 2009 , Rosenberg became FIU 's fifth president . 
 Having started as a two @-@ year upper division university serving the Miami area , FIU has grown into a much larger traditional university and serves international students . More than $ 600 million has been invested in campus construction , with the addition of new residence halls , the FIU Stadium , recreation center , student center , and Greek life mansions , as well as the fielding of the Division I @-@ A Golden Panthers football team in 2002 . 
 Since 1986 , the university established its School of Architecture , College of Law and College of Medicine ( named the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in 1999 after Herbert Wertheim donated $ 20 million to the college , which was matched by state funds and is the largest donation in the university 's history ) , and acquired the historic Wolfsonian @-@ FIU Museum in Miami Beach . 
 FIU now emphasizes research as a major component of its mission and is now classed as a " very high research activity " university under the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education . Sponsored research funding ( grants and contracts ) from external sources for the year 2007 – 2008 totaled some $ 110 million . FIU has a budget of over $ 649 million 
 FIU 's School of Hospitality & Tourism Management collaborated with China 's Ministry of Education to work on preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics . FIU was the only university in the United States invited to do so . Royal Caribbean is building a $ 20 million 130 @,@ 000 sq. ft. training facility for its performers at the school . It is scheduled to open in 2015 . The buildings will serve architecture , art , and hospitality students including lighting , set design , marketing , and other internship and training opportunities . 
 On October 2 , 2014 , it was announced that Florida International University would play host to the Miss Universe 2014 pageant on January 25 , 2015 . FIU also hosted a talk from President Barack Obama in February 2015 .

 The main campus , University Park , renamed Modesto Maidique Campus in 2009 , encompasses 344 acres ( 1 @.@ 4 km ² ) in the Miami neighborhood of University Park , ( from which the area derives its name ) . 
 University Park houses almost all of the university 's colleges and schools as well as all the administrative offices and main university facilities . University Park is also home to the Ronald Reagan Presidential House , the home of FIU 's president , the Wertheim Performing Arts Center , the Frost Art Museum , the International Hurricane Research Center , and the university 's athletic facilities such as FIU Stadium , FIU Arena , and the FIU Baseball Stadium .

 = = = = University Park history = = = = 
 The site of the campus was originally used for a general aviation airport called Tamiami Airport ( not to be confused with Kendall @-@ Tamiami Airport ) , which was in operation from the 1940s until 1967 . The airport had three runways and was used for pilot training , among other purposes . Construction on the FIU campus began in 1965 , and the airport closed in 1969 . At the time , very little was located around FIU , and the campus was referred to as University Park . As Miami grew west , the area came to be known as University Park after the university 's campus name . 
 Until the early 1990s , the runways , parking ramp and other features of Tamiami Airport were still visible on campus and clearly discernible in aerial photos . Construction has removed all of these features , and only the University Tower remains as a memory of the university 's past . University Park is a lush , heavily vegetated campus , with many lakes and a 15 @-@ acre nature preserve , as well as a palm arboretum and has over 90 buildings . As of late 2009 , current construction at University Park includes the Nursing and Health Sciences Building , the School of International and Public Affairs Building , and a fifth parking garage . 
 On June 12 , 2009 , FIU 's Board of Trustees voted unanimously to rename the University Park campus to the Modesto Maidique Campus . However , the change created a large backlash from the FIU community , as many felt it unfitting to name the campus after him . A campaign by FIU students and alumni was created to revert the name change , and to keep the name University Park . A Facebook group , " No to Maidique 's Campus " with over 2 @,@ 000 supporters has made national news , in many newspapers , TV news stations , and collegiate magazines , supporting to keep the name " University Park " .

 = Cyclone Xavier = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Xavier ( RSMC Nadi Designation : 01F , JTWC Designation : 01P ) was a strong pre @-@ season cyclone that formed on October 20 , 2006 to the north of the Santa Cruz Islands . During the next day it rapidly developed and was designated as Tropical Depression 01F later that day , before being designated as Tropical Cyclone Xavier while over Santa Cruz early on October 22 . Later on October 22 , Xavier intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale , before passing over Tikopia early the next day . Xavier then reached its peak wind speeds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph 10 @-@ min ) , which made it a Category 4 cyclone early on October 24 . Xavier stayed at its peak wind speeds until early the next day when it started to rapidly weaken , becoming a depression early on October 26 . The remnants of Xavier persisted until October 28 before dissipating . There were no casualties reported as a result of the storm and little impact reported in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 During October 20 , 2006 the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to monitor a tropical depression , that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the north of Temotu Province in the Solomon Islands . The system was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear and had a good outflow in its northern and eastern quadrants . Over the next day conditions surrounding the system rapidly became favourable for further development , with convection starting to wrap into a well defined low level circulation centre . As a result , the depression rapidly developed further and was named Xavier by the FMS during October 22 , after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale . After the system was named the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01P , while it was located over the Santa Cruz Islands . Throughout October 22 , Xavier 's rapid intensification continued with it developing an eye feature and becoming a category 3 severe tropical cyclone . During that day the system performed a small cyclonic loop over Temotu Province and passed near or over the Santa Cruz Island of Tikopia . 
 The systems rapid intensification subsequently slowed down during October 23 , as an upper @-@ level anticyclone located to the northwest of the system impeded the systems outflow . The system also started to move south @-@ eastwards during that day , as a trough of low pressure created a break in the ridge of high pressure that was steering Xavier . The FMS subsequently estimated during October 24 , that the system had peaked as a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10 @-@ minute sustained wind speeds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) , while it was located about 220 km ( 135 mi ) to the east of Vanua Lava in northern Vanuatu . The JTWC also estimated during October 24 , that the system had peaked with 1 @-@ minute sustained wind speeds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) , which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale . Over the next day the system maintained its peak intensity as it moved south @-@ eastwards , before it turned westwards during the next day towards Vanuatu and rapidly weakened after it moved into an area of cooler sea @-@ surface temperatures and strong vertical wind @-@ shear . As a result , during October 26 , The FMS and JTWC both reported that the system had weakened into a tropical depression , with the JTWC issuing their final advisory on the system as they expected it to dissipate within 12 hours . Xavier 's remnants were last noted by the FMS during October 28 , after the systems low level circulation centre was not able to be distinguished .

 Early on October 22 , both RSMC Nadi and TCWC Brisbane started to issue special advisories to support the meteorological services of Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands in tracking the cyclone . As Xavier was over the islands of Santa Cruz the whole of Temotu Province was placed under a tropical cyclone gale warning , while cyclone watches were declared for <unk> , Bellona , and Vanuatu . During the next 24 hours , the Torres and Banks Islands , as well as Espirito Santo , Maewo , <unk> , were placed under a cyclone warning . The warnings for the Solomon Islands were then cancelled early the next day , while the warnings for Vanuatu were maintained until late on October 25 , when RSMC Nadi discontinued them . 
 There were no casualties as a result of Xavier . In the Solomon Islands , communications to the Temotu province were lost . When communications were restored on October 24 , it was reported that there was only minor tree damage on the islands of <unk> and <unk> . On Tikopia , crops sustained damage , though the effects were considered light given the circumstances . Strong and gusty winds , rough seas and moderate to heavy swells were reported within the eastern Vanuatuan islands , however , no significant damage was reported within the islands .

 SummerSlam 1988 was the first annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event . It was produced by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) and took place on August 29 , 1988 , in Madison Square Garden , located in New York City , New York . The pay @-@ per @-@ view was created to help the company compete against rival promotion World Championship Wrestling ( formerly Jim Crockett Promotions ) . It was one of the first four annual pay @-@ per @-@ view events produced by the WWF , along with WrestleMania , the Royal Rumble , and Survivor Series . 
 The event consisted of ten professional wrestling matches . The preliminary matches included a title defense by Intercontinental Champion The Honky Tonk Man against a surprise challenger , who turned out to be The Ultimate Warrior . The Ultimate Warrior won the match in approximately thirty seconds to end the longest Intercontinental Championship reign . The main event was a match pitting The Mega Powers ( Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage ) against their long @-@ time rivals , The Mega Bucks ( Ted DiBiase and André the Giant ) . Hogan and Savage won the match after Miss Elizabeth , Savage 's manager , distracted the André and DiBiase , by removing her skirt to reveal a bikini bottom . 
 = = Development = = 
 In the late 1980s , Vince McMahon 's World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) ' s main competition in the professional wrestling industry was from Jim Crockett Promotions . McMahon countered Jim Crockett 's successful Starrcade pay @-@ per @-@ view , which began airing in 1983 , by creating the WrestleMania franchise . After WrestleMania III in March 1987 , the most successful professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event in history , McMahon created the Survivor Series franchise , which aired the same day as Starrcade 1987 in November 1987 . After defeating Crockett in the ratings war , McMahon created the Royal Rumble , an event airing for free on the USA Network in January 1988 . The event set a ratings record for the network with eight million households tuning in to watch the event . In retaliation , Crockett created the Clash of the Champions event , which aired simultaneously with WrestleMania IV . WrestleMania IV garnered higher ratings , and not long after , Crockett filed for bankruptcy and sold his company to Ted Turner , who renamed it World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) . 
 As the WWF continued to replace its closed circuit programming with pay @-@ per @-@ view programming , McMahon added more pay @-@ per @-@ views to the lineup to capitalize on the success of his previous events . In addition to WrestleMania in March , Royal Rumble in January , and Survivor Series in November , McMahon created an event for August , which he named SummerSlam . To keep the WWF from having a pay @-@ per @-@ view market monopoly , Turner began airing monthly WCW pay @-@ per @-@ views . As a result , both companies brought in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue . SummerSlam became one of World Wrestling Federation 's most successful events and one of the " Big Four " pay @-@ per @-@ views , along with WrestleMania , Survivor Series , and Royal Rumble . Those four events , along with the King of the Ring , are known as the " Classic Five " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Prior to SummerSlam , The Honky Tonk Man , a villainous character , had been the longest reigning Intercontinental Champion in WWF history . He was originally supposed to defend his championship against Brutus Beefcake , but Beefcake was unable to compete as a result of a ( storyline ) injury received from " Outlaw " Ron Bass the week before . 
 Also prior to the event , Demolition ( Ax and Smash ) held the WWF World Tag Team Championship , which they had won at WrestleMania IV after only a year in the WWF , and would defend their titles at SummerSlam against former champions The Hart Foundation ( Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart ) , who had become fan favorites a few weeks earlier by turning on their manager Jimmy Hart . 
 The on @-@ screen feud between Rick Rude and Jake Roberts began weeks before SummerSlam . As part of his gimmick , Rude would — after winning a match — invite a pre @-@ selected woman from the audience to kiss him in the ring . On one occasion , one of the women refused to comply , later identifying herself as Robert 's wife , Cheryl . As the feud intensified , Rude began wearing a pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl stenciled on them , prompting a furious Roberts to charge into the ring and strip the tights off Rude , appearing to television viewers to leave Rude naked , although the live audience saw him stripped to a g @-@ string instead . 
 For months prior to the pay @-@ per @-@ view , Hulk Hogan and undisputed WWF Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage , two of the WWF 's top crowd favorites , had feuded with André the Giant and Ted DiBiase , respectively . The two feuds first came together at WrestleMania IV , when — as the result of the vacating of the WWF Heavyweight Championship — a 14 @-@ man single @-@ elimination tournament was set up to crown a new champion . Hogan and André had been disqualified in their quarterfinal match , while Savage and DiBiase reached the championship match ; in that final match , Savage defeated DiBiase with help from Hogan . Savage and DiBiase feuded over the title throughout the spring and summer , but André did not become involved until mid @-@ summer when he and DiBiase helped instigate a 2 @-@ on @-@ 1 attack against Savage as he was delivering a promo . Savage quickly recovered and challenged André and DiBiase to a tag team match against him and a partner to be named . That partner later was revealed to be Hogan ; the team became known as " The Mega Powers . " The André @-@ DiBiase team — which dubbed itself " The Mega Bucks " — retaliated by announcing the guest referee would be someone they declared to be fair and neutral : Jesse Ventura , a color commentator on the WWF 's programs who favored the villains , though according to the main storyline , Ventura was chosen by WWF President Jack Tunney as the only person capable of handling such a match .

 The event began with a match between The British Bulldogs ( Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid ) and The Fabulous Rougeaus ( Jacques and Raymond Rougeau ) . As soon as the bell rang to signify that the match had begun , Smith attacked Jacques . The two teams traded blows until The Rougeaus flipped Dynamite Kid over their heads so that he fell on his back to the mat . Dynamite Kid escaped another offensive maneuver before tagging in his partner , Smith , and The British Bulldogs performed a double @-@ team maneuver on Jacques . Despite having the upper hand , The Bulldogs failed to pin Jacques in time , and the match ended in a twenty @-@ minute time draw . The next match was between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera . Before the bell rang , however , Brown attacked Patera , who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner . Patera then slipped both of his arms underneath Brown 's armpits and locked his hands behind his neck , using a submission move known as a full nelson . At the end of the match , Brown defeated Patera by striking him in the back of the head with his finishing move , the Ghetto Blaster . 
 After the second match ended , Rick Rude and the Junkyard Dog made their way to the ring . Their match began as Rude attacked Junkyard Dog from behind , who retaliated by headbutting Rude several times . Subsequently , Rude climbed to the wrestling ring 's top rope and pulled down his tights to reveal another pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl Roberts on them . As a result , Jake Roberts , Cheryl Roberts ' husband , ran to the ring and attacked Rude , forcing the referee to disqualify the Junkyard Dog . The next match was a tag team match between The Powers of Pain ( The Barbarian and The Warlord ) , who were accompanied by their manager The Baron , and The Bolsheviks ( Boris Zhukov and Nikolai Volkoff ) , who were accompanied by Slick . Immediately , The Powers of Pain chased The Bolsheviks from the ring . Slick , however , distracted The Powers of Pain long enough to give The Bolsheviks an advantage . Zhukov was then slammed to the mat back @-@ first and headbutted from the top rope , which allowed The Barbarian to pin him . 
 The fifth match of the event was an Intercontinental Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and the reigning champion The Honky Tonk Man , who was accompanied by Jimmy Hart . Before the match it had been announced that Honky 's original challenger , Brutus Beefcake , was unable to wrestle . Prior to the match , the Honky Tonk Man refused to be informed about Beefcake 's replacement and immediately before the match , even grabbed ring announcer Howard Finkel 's microphone and said " Give me someone out here to wrestle , I don 't care who it is " . His challenge was answered by The Ultimate Warrior . Warrior , who accidentally knocked Finkel to the floor when he rushed into the ring and hit the ropes , had the advantage from the beginning , attacking The Honky Tonk Man , who was still in his entrance attire . After body @-@ slamming him to the mat and following it up with a clothesline , The Warrior bounded to the ropes and landed stomach @-@ first on The Honky Tonk Man using his signature move , the Warrior Splash . The Ultimate Warrior then pinned The Honky Tonk Man after only thirty seconds to win the title . The longest Intercontinental title reign in WWF history had ended with one of the shortest IC title matches in history . This match was probably the one where the audience cheered the loudest ; the moment the Warrior defeated the hapless Honky Tonk Man , the fans erupted with cheers , with many even voting it the match of the year . 
 The following contest was a re @-@ match from WrestleMania IV between Dino Bravo and Don Muraco . Muraco , the crowd favorite , was in control for most of the match until Bravo 's manager Frenchy Martin distracted Muraco , allowing Bravo to use his side suplex and pin him for the win . 
 The seventh match of the night was for the WWF Tag Team Championship . Reigning champions Demolition ( Ax and Smash ) , accompanied by both Mr. Fuji and Jimmy Hart , were challenged by The Hart Foundation ( Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart ) . As soon as the bell sounded , The Hart Foundation attacked both members of Demolition . Their control was brief , as Demolition then gained the advantage over Neidhart . As Bret Hart was tagged into the match , Neidhart chased Jimmy Hart from ringside and returned to tag back into the match . When all four men began fighting inside the ring , Neidhart attacked Mr. Fuji , who was on the ring apron . At the end of the match , Bret Hart attempted a piledriver but Ax hit him with Jimmy Hart 's trademark megaphone . Smash then pinned Bret Hart for the win . 
 The next match was between the Big Boss Man , accompanied by Slick , and Koko B. Ware . With Slick as a distraction , the Big Boss Man took the early advantage in the match . After crushing Ware in between himself and the turnbuckle , Boss Man refused to pin him and finish the match . Instead , he attempted to climb to the top rope and land on Ware stomach @-@ first , but missed . Ware then retaliated by performing several dropkicks and attempted a pin . Boss Man got his shoulder up to save himself from being pinned , and he slammed his opponent into the mat , allowing him to pin Ware for the win . The second to last match of the night was between Jake Roberts and Hercules . When Roberts attempted to slam his opponent 's head on to the mat with a DDT , Hercules was able to escape the maneuver and take control of the match . As Hercules attempted to slam Roberts to the mat , Roberts reversed the move into a DDT , enabling him to pin Hercules for the win . 
 The last match of the night was the main event between The Mega Powers ( Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage ) , accompanied by Miss Elizabeth , and The Mega Bucks ( Ted DiBiase and André the Giant ) , accompanied by André 's manager Bobby Heenan and DiBiase 's bodyguard Virgil . Jesse Ventura was the special guest referee . The Mega Powers took the early advantage over DiBiase . After Hogan attacked André the Giant , who was on the ring apron , The Mega Bucks were able to regain control . After a while , all four men began brawling , and André knocked The Mega Powers out of the ring . Subsequently , as part of the scripted ending to the match , Miss Elizabeth began arguing with Ventura , the referee , and ripped off her skirt to reveal her underwear . While the Mega Bucks were distracted , Savage climbed to the top rope and dropped the Macho Elbow on DiBiase , followed by Hogan hitting the leg drop on DiBiase . As Hogan pinned DiBiase , Ventura , a villainous character aligned with The Mega Bucks ( despite being a long time on @-@ air Savage fan and his former tag @-@ team partner ) , began an obviously slow three @-@ count . As a result , Savage slammed Ventura 's arm down for the third time , indicating that Hogan and Savage had won the match . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Mega Powers continued to team together after the event , until a new storyline was developed where Randy Savage became jealous over Hulk Hogan paying attention to Miss Elizabeth , and as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion felt slighted over his perceived lower billing in the Mega Powers ' pecking order . Several key events were developed to foreshadow their burgeoning feud . These included Hogan asking Elizabeth to accompany him to televised matches , where he would act overly friendly with her ; and accidentally eliminating Savage from the Royal Rumble in January 1989 by knocking him over the top rope and to the floor . The final falling out happened on The Main Event , when Elizabeth received an on @-@ screen injury during a tag team match . Savage , left alone in the ring while Hogan tended to Elizabeth , attacked Hogan backstage . This rivalry culminated in a match for Savage 's WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania V , where Hogan won the title by pinning Savage . 
 As WWF Intercontinental Champion , the Ultimate Warrior began receiving more on @-@ air time and more prominent matches . His feud with the Honky Tonk Man continued for several months , until Warrior was placed in a new feud with Rick Rude in early 1989 . 
 After retaining their title against The Hart Foundation , Demolition held the WWF Tag Team Championship for another 11 months , as part of a record @-@ breaking 16 @-@ month reign as champions , before eventually losing the title to The Brain Busters ( Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson ) on the Saturday Night 's Main Event . During the midst of their title reign , despite being billed as villains , Demolition 's popularity with fans continued to grow , and the tag team eventually was turned face at the 1988 Survivor Series . 
 = = Production and reception = = 
 The event was produced by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) and took place on August 29 , 1988 in New York City 's Madison Square Garden . The pay @-@ per @-@ view had a 4 @.@ 5 buyrate , which means that 4 @.@ 5 % of pay @-@ per @-@ view subscribers ordered the event . 
 The original plan for SummerSlam was to bring Ric Flair over from the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) to the WWF . Vince McMahon , the owner of the WWF , wanted Flair to challenge Savage in the main event for the WWF Championship . Flair , however , felt obliged to the NWA and did not leave the promotion for the WWF . Therefore , Hogan and Savage were paired together to end their feuds with their respective on @-@ screen rivals . 
 In WWE.com 's 2007 list of the top ten SummerSlam moments in history , The Ultimate Warrior 's Intercontinental Championship title win was listed as number ten , while Miss Elizabeth 's distraction during the main event was listed at number nine . 
 Calum Waddell , in Fighting Spirit Magazine , called The Ultimate Warrior 's win over the Honky Tonk Man " genuinely captivating , " and he said the match between The British Bulldogs and The Fabulous Rougeaus was an " exciting battle " . In contrast , he had a negative reaction to the main event match , citing it as " predictably one @-@ dimensional " and " abysmal " . Similarly , Adam <unk> of 411mania.com called the tag team match between The British Bulldogs and The Rougeaus " a solid match " but stated that the " lack of a finish was a disappointment " . Although he reviewed most of the matches negatively , he called the WWF World Tag Team Championship match a " good match " . Overall , he rated the event a 4 @.@ 5 out of 10 and stated , " Without Warrior 's big win and Elizabeth 's surprise finish , this is a totally forgettable show . "

 = Fatima Massaquoi = 
 Fatima Massaquoi @-@ Fahnbulleh ( 1904 – 1978 ) was a pioneering educator in Liberia . After completing her education in the United States , she returned to Liberia in 1946 , where she contributed much to the cultural and social life of the country . 
 Born into a family of African royalty , Massaquoi grew up in the care of an aunt in <unk> , in the <unk> District of Grand Cape Mount County of southern Liberia . After seven years , she returned to the northwestern part of the country in <unk> County , where she began her schooling . In 1922 she accompanied her father , a diplomat , to Hamburg , Germany , where she completed her studies in medicine at the University of Hamburg in 1937 . She moved to the United States for further education , studying sociology and anthropology at Lane College , Fisk University and Boston University . While in the US , she collaborated on a dictionary of the Vai language and wrote her autobiography , though a legal battle ensued over the rights to her story . She won an injunction barring others from publishing and returned to Liberia in 1946 , immediately beginning collaboration to establish a university there , which would become the University of Liberia . 
 Committed to national cultural preservation and expansion , Massaquoi served as the director , later dean , of the Liberal Arts College and was the founding director of the Institute of African Studies . She co @-@ founded the Society of Liberian Authors , helped abolish the practice of usurping African names for Westernized versions , and worked towards standardization of the Vai script . In the late 1960s , Vivian Seton , Massaquoi 's daughter , had the autobiographical manuscript microfilmed for preservation . After Massaquoi 's death , her writings and notes were rediscovered , edited and published in 2013 as The Autobiography of an African Princess . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Massaquoi was born in <unk> in the <unk> District of southern Sierra Leone in 1904 , the daughter of <unk> Massaquoi , who in 1922 became Liberia 's consul general in Hamburg , Germany , and Massa <unk> <unk> . At birth , she was given the name Fatima <unk> <unk> , but dropped the <unk> before it became part of her records . Her paternal grandfather was King <unk> Massaquoi of the <unk> , and her paternal grandmother was Queen <unk> ( or <unk> ) of Sierra Leone 's aristocratic Vai family . She was also the great @-@ great @-@ granddaughter of King <unk> of <unk> who ruled over the <unk> in the 18th century . 
 Massaquoi spent her first seven years with her father 's sister , Mama <unk> , in <unk> in the <unk> District of Grand Cape Mount County . While she was there , one of her father 's six wives , Ma <unk> , seriously injured Fatima 's hands for a misdemeanor . This caused her considerable pain throughout her childhood , hampering her ability to play the violin . She later became a highly competent player , though she remained self @-@ conscious about the scarring even as an adult . After elementary school , she was sent to boarding school at Julia C. Emery Hall , attached to the Bromley Mission near Clay @-@ Ashland in <unk> County . 
 <unk> Massaquoi sought to give his favourite child , and only daughter , the very best education . She went with him to Hamburg in 1922 , where she lived at the consulate at 22 <unk> . Receiving her primary school education at St. <unk> Höhere <unk> , Massaquoi quickly mastered German . On the recommendation of the consulate 's housekeeper , Gertrude von <unk> , to whom she became very attached , in 1932 she spent some time in Geneva , Switzerland , where she learnt French at the École Supérieure et <unk> . The same year , she returned to Hamburg , attending the Helen Lange Schule , where she received her school leaving certificate in 1935 . She then went on to study medicine at the University of Hamburg graduating in 1937 . 
 Hans J. Massaquoi , her nephew , who was in Hamburg during the same period , recounts that " <unk> Fatima " dressed exotically in African clothing , proudly maintained her African habits and spoke the Vai language . One of her fondest friends in Hamburg was Richard <unk> , a pianist , with whom she gave many recitals . An opponent of Nazism , when war broke out he was sent to Russia , and was later reported missing in action . Being part of the first black diplomatic family in Germany had always been challenging , but with the rise of the Nazi regime , Massaquoi 's father began fearing for her safety . With the assistance of friends , he helped her relocate to the United States to avoid the Aryan policies and restrictions placed on women . 
 = = Years in the United States = = 
 Massaquoi arrived that same year in the United States and experienced the racial segregation and Jim Crow laws of the Southern States . She first attended Lane College in Jackson , Tennessee , graduating in sociology . Two years later she moved to Fisk University in Nashville earning two master 's degrees , first in sociology and then in anthropology in 1944 . She assisted her professor , Mark Hanna Watkins , in his understanding of the Vai language , cooperating with him in compiling a Vai dictionary . She agreed to accept a fellowship as a linguistic advisor , after her father died in 1938 . She taught French and German at Fisk and also paid her way by giving instruction in African and European folk dancing , as well as teaching the violin , thanks to her own competence on the instrument . 
 In 1940 , Massaquoi finished writing an autobiographical account of her early life as a tribal child , her life experiences with Europeans and education in Germany and Switzerland , and impressions of America . Watkins told her the English was too poor for publication , but later he claimed in a 1944 letter that she had written the account upon his insistence . While awaiting the editing , Massaquoi continued helping the school prepare a dictionary on the Vai language , teaching cultural dance and language , but was unhappy with the arrangement which paid only a small sum . When she attempted to retrieve her manuscript , Watkins refused and she sued the university for its return and to bar them from publishing her works . In 1945 , she won a permanent injunction against Watkins , Dr. Thomas E. Jones , president of the university , and Fisk University prohibiting them from publishing or receiving any financial rewards from any publication of the work . Massaquoi felt that she had been " conspired against " because she was foreign and a presumption that she did not have the strength to fight for her rights . 
 In 1946 while at Boston University , Massaquoi completed editing the autobiography ( which was originally titled Bush to Boulevard : The Autobiography of a Vai <unk> ) . Thanks to her extensive travels and education , by this time , she spoke several languages — at least eight and four tribal dialects . In addition to her native Vai and Mende , she spoke English which she had first learnt at school in Liberia , German from her many years in Hamburg , and French from her schooling in Switzerland . 
 = = Return to Liberia = = 
 Upon the invitation of President William Tubman , Massaquoi returned to Liberia on 13 October 1946 to help him establish a university in Monrovia . She became Professor of French and Science in March 1947 at Liberia College , later the University of Liberia ( UL ) . In 1956 , she became director , then dean ( 1960 ) , of the Liberal Arts College and was a co @-@ founder of the Society of Liberian Authors . In 1962 Massaquoi founded and directed a programme for African Studies , which would evolve into the Institute of African Studies at UL . 
 During her term at the university , Massaquoi succeeded in overcoming the requirement that students should adopt foreign names rather than keeping those of their indigenous families . In connection with this , when she married Ernest Freeman on 26 July 1948 , Massaquoi adopted his tribal name Fahnbulleh , calling herself Fatima Massaquoi @-@ Fahnbulleh . Her husband also changed his own name back to Fahnbulleh . To further contribute to the cultural and social development of Liberia , she organized a seminar through the African Studies Program in 1962 to promote the standardization of the Vai script . 
 With a view to enhancing educational developments in Liberia , in late 1963 and early 1964 , Massaquoi spent six months in the United States on an education scholarship , visiting fine arts colleges and university departments of anthropology and sociology , mainly in the east and mid @-@ west . In 1968 , while living in Monrovia , Liberia , with her daughter Vivian Seton and her grandchildren , Massaquoi suffered a stroke . This pressed Seton into having the 700 pages of her mother 's unpublished autobiography microfilmed , calling on the assistance of colleagues at the University of Liberia . Massaquoi retired from the university in the summer of 1972 , receiving an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree . She was also decorated as a Grand Commander of the Grand Star of Africa by the president of Liberia . 
 Fatima Massaquoi @-@ Fahnbulleh died in Monrovia on 26 November 1978 . Posthumously , her microfilmed manuscripts were discovered by German researcher Konrad Tuchscherer , while conducting other research . Arthur Abraham , a historian at Virginia State University , Massaquoi 's daughter , Vivian Seton , and Tuchscherer , edited the accounts of her early experiences in Germany and the United States . The book , The Autobiography of an African Princess , was published in 2013 and was well received by critics . Tamba M ’ <unk> of West Virginia University , stated : " The strengths of this autobiography could be gauged at two or more different levels . First , its down @-@ to @-@ heart and honest account of even the most disturbing personal experiences … Second the larger canvas of Sierra Leonean and Liberian cultural and ethno @-@ linguistic history in which Fatima ’ s story is told . Rich in content and well orchestrated … " . 
 = = Accolades = = 
 Throughout her life , Massaquoi received a number of awards and honors , both locally and internationally . She was bestowed with the <unk> Bust of Molière by the French Government in 1955 . In 1962 , she was honoured with the <unk> <unk> erster Klasse from the Federal Republic of Germany by President Heinrich Lübke . Upon her 1972 retirement , she was granted an honorary Doctor of Humanities from UL and awarded the rank of Grand Commander of the Grand Star of Africa by President William R. Tolbert , Jr . When Massaquoi died , a tribute was held at the University of Liberia . Mary Antoinette Brown @-@ Sherman , who up to that time was the only woman to have served anywhere in Africa as a university president , proclaimed , " Hers was a life of dedication to the Liberian nation and to the cause of education .

 = United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 = 
 United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 was a measure adopted by the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) on June 25 , 1950 . The resolution demanded North Korea immediately end its invasion of South Korea , the catalyst for the beginning of the Korean War . The measure was adopted by a vote of 9 support , none opposed , and one abstention . 
 The Korean Peninsula had been divided between occupation forces of the United States and the Soviet Union since the end of World War II along the 38th Parallel . Each government sought to prop up a government on its side of the occupation border , and as the Cold War began , tensions rose between the two Koreas . These culminated in open warfare with the North 's invasion of the South on June 25 . During this time , the United Nations backed South Korea and considered it the only lawful government . 
 The resolution called on the North to immediately halt its invasion and to move its troops back to the 38th parallel . Seen as a diplomatic victory for the United States , the resolution was completely ignored by North Korea . This brought the UN and the US to take further action , setting the state for massive international involvement and the expansion of the Korean War . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Division of Korea = = = 
 At the end of World War II , the Korean Peninsula , which up to that point had been occupied by the Empire of Japan , was divided along the 38th Parallel . To the north , the Soviet Union ( USSR ) occupied the country , which established itself as a communist state , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea under Kim Il Sung . To the south , the United States ( US ) occupied the country , establishing the Republic of Korea under an autocratic anti @-@ communist leader , Syngman Rhee . As tensions rose between the US and the USSR , each government in Korea claimed it had sovereignty over the whole country . 
 In the late @-@ 1947 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 112 established a temporary commission to monitor free elections in Korea . The UN had intended to reunify Korea under one government , but the UN commission was unable to enter North Korea . After observing elections in South Korea , the UN stated in General Assembly Resolution 195 on December 12 , 1948 , that the nation was to be established under one government as soon as possible , and the US and Soviet occupation forces there were to withdraw . 
 As time went on , the North Korean government became more aggressive , and skirmishes between troops of the North and South became common . UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating . United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293 , passed October 21 , 1949 , recognized only South Korea 's government as legal . For its part , North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country . 
 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 On the night of June 25 , 1950 , ten divisions of the North Korean People 's Army launched a full @-@ scale invasion of the Republic of Korea . The force of 89 @,@ 000 men moved in six columns , catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise , resulting in a rout . The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of equipment , and was unprepared for war . The numerically superior North Korean forces overcame isolated resistance from the 38 @,@ 000 South Korean soldiers on the frontier before it began moving steadily south . Most of South Korea 's forces retreated in the face of the invasion . The North Koreans were well on their way to South Korea 's capital of Seoul within hours , forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat further south . 
 News of the invasion quickly spread around the world via ambassadors and correspondents in Korea . Journalists in the United States were reporting on the invasion within five hours of the initial attack , and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21 : 26 EST ( 10 : 26 KST ) June 24 . As the combat grew more intense , US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman ( who had been resting at his home in Independence , Missouri for the weekend ) , and Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation . The attack was particularly troubling to Truman , who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , and to Lie , who was reminded of the Invasion of Norway during World War II . Fearing the attack would spur a World War III , Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an escalation of the conflict . Muccio met with Rhee , who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days , and would not be able to hold back the invasion on its own . He requested the United Nations and the United States assist South Korea in the conflict . 
 Lie convened the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) for its <unk> meeting at 14 : 00 June 25 in New York City , New York . He began the meeting with a detailed report from the UN Commission on Korea , explained the situation to the delegates , and insisted that the UN take action to restore peace in Korea . According to the UN Commission on Korea , the situation was assuming the character of full @-@ scale warfare . Then , US diplomat Ernest A. Gross gave Muccio 's report on the situation . 
 The United States introduced a resolution stating that North Korea 's invasion was a breach of peace in violation of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter . Gross requested that South Korea 's ambassador to the United Nations , Chang Myon , be present for the meeting , which was granted . The Yugoslavian delegate requested that a North Korean diplomat be present as well , but this request was not granted . North Korea was not a member of the UN and had no representation in the organization . Myon read a prepared statement calling the invasion a crime against humanity , and said that as the UN had played a major role in the founding of South Korea , it was their responsibility to help defend it from aggression . The UNSC debated the resolution and made amendments and revisions to its wording before passing it . 
 = = The resolution = = 
 The resolution passed with 9 supports and no opposition . Supporting nations included the United States , the United Kingdom , Republic of China , France , Cuba , Ecuador , Egypt , Norway and India . Ales <unk> , delegate from Yugoslavia , abstained from voting . The Soviet Union 's delegate had boycotted all UN meetings because of procedural disagreements earlier in the year . Soviet ambassador to the United Nations Yakov Malik had been personally ordered not to attend the UNSC meetings by Soviet premier Joseph Stalin . Lie was a strong supporter of the resolution , as he saw the conflict as a challenge to the authority of the UN . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The resolution was seen as a political victory for the United States , as it identified North Korea as the aggressor in the conflict . Earlier in the day , independent of the UN resolution , Truman had ordered the Joint Chiefs of Staff to contact US Army General of the Army Douglas Macarthur , who was in charge of US forces in the Far East . He ordered MacArthur to prepare ships for the evacuation of US citizens from Korea , and authorized him to send ammunition and supplies to Pusan to support South Korean forces in the Seoul @-@ Kimpo area . These would be escorted by US military units . He instructed MacArthur to send a survey team into the country to assess the situation and determine how to aid South Korea . Truman also ordered the mobilization of the US Navy for movement into the region . 
 The US delegation later contacted the Soviet delegation and sent a message requesting that the Kremlin use its influence over North Korea to compel it to comply with the resolution , but the Soviet Union denied the request . With the ineffectiveness of the resolution in de @-@ escalating the conflict , the UNSC convened on June 27 to discuss further actions to take , resulting in United Nations Security Council Resolution 83 , which recommended military intervention by other UN member nations to restore peace in Korea . Within days , ships and aircraft from several nations , as well as the first major formations of US troops , were moving to South Korea , setting the stage for a full @-@ scale conflict . 
 In a 2010 column , Colum Lynch of Foreign Policy magazine criticized the resolution as one of the ten worst UN resolutions in history . After the Soviet Union ended its boycott of the council , it used its veto power to block any further resolutions against North Korea . In response , Acheson introduced a new procedure to the UN General Assembly to allow a member state to bypass the UNSC and seek approval in the General Assembly , including recommendations on the use of force , United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377 . When this was passed , it allowed for open @-@ ended General Assembly emergency special sessions to address threats to international peace and security for which the UNSC was unable to pass a resolution . Lynch wrote that the creation of this rule caused unintended negative consequences for the United States in 1997 when several Arab states began the Tenth emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to address the Israeli – Palestinian conflict and Israel 's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . This session , convened as a way around a US veto , spanned 30 meetings over the next ten years , and has never formally been closed . 
 = College of Arms = 
 The College of Arms , also known as the College of Heralds , is a royal corporation consisting of professional officers of arms , with jurisdiction over England , Wales , Northern Ireland and some Commonwealth realms . The heralds are appointed by the British Sovereign and are delegated authority to act on behalf of the Crown in all matters of heraldry , the granting of new coats of arms , genealogical research and the recording of pedigrees . The College is also the official body responsible for matters relating to the flying of flags on land , and it maintains the official registers of flags and other national symbols . Though a part of the Royal Household of the United Kingdom the College is self @-@ financed , unsupported by any public funds . 
 Founded by royal charter in 1484 by King Richard III , the College is one of the few remaining official heraldic authorities in Europe . Within the United Kingdom , there are two such authorities , the Court of the Lord Lyon in Scotland and the College for the rest of the United Kingdom . The College has had its home in the City of London since its foundation , and has been at its present location on Queen Victoria Street since 1555 . The College of Arms also undertakes and consults on the planning of many ceremonial occasions such as coronations , state funerals , the annual Garter Service and the State Opening of Parliament . Heralds of the College accompany the sovereign on many of these occasions . 
 The College comprises thirteen officers or heralds : three Kings of Arms , six Heralds of Arms and four Pursuivants of Arms . There are also seven officers extraordinary , who take part in ceremonial occasions but are not part of the College . The entire corporation is overseen by the Earl Marshal , a hereditary office held by the Duke of Norfolk , currently Edward Fitzalan @-@ Howard , 18th Duke of Norfolk . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Foundation = = = 
 King Richard III 's interest in heraldry was indicated by his possession of two important Rolls of Arms . While still Duke of Gloucester and Constable of England for his brother ( Edward IV ) from 1469 , he in the latter capacity supervised the heralds and made plans for the reform of their organisation . Soon after his accession to the throne he created Sir John Howard as Duke of Norfolk and Earl Marshal of England , who became the first Howard appointed to both positions . 
 In the first year of his reign , the royal heralds were incorporated under Royal charter dated 2 March 1484 , under the Latin name " Le Garter regis armorum <unk> , regis armorum partium Australium , regis armorum partium <unk> , regis armorum <unk> et <unk> , <unk> , sive <unk> armorum . " Translated as : " the Garter King of Arms of England , the King of Arms of the Southern parts , the King of Arms of the Northern parts , the King of Arms of Wales , and all other heralds and pursuivants of arms " . The charter then goes on to state that the heralds " for the time being , shall be in perpetuity a body corporate in fact and name , and shall preserve a succession unbroken . " This charter titled " <unk> de <unk> <unk> " is now held in the British Museum . There has been some evidence that prior to this charter , the royal heralds had already in some ways behaved like a corporation as early as 1420 . Nevertheless , the charter is the earliest surviving document to affirm the chapter as a corporate body of heralds . The charter outlines the constitution of the officers , their hierarchy , the privileges conferred upon them and their jurisdiction over all heraldic matters in the Kingdom of England . 
 The King empowered the College to have and use only one common seal of authority , and also instructed them to find a chaplain to celebrate mass daily for himself , Anne Neville , the Queen Consort , and his heir , Prince Edward . The College was also granted a house named Coldharbour ( formerly <unk> 's Inn ) on Upper Thames Street in the parish of All @-@ Hallows @-@ the @-@ Less , for storing records and living space for the heralds . The house , built by Sir John de Pulteney , four times Lord Mayor of London , was said to be one of the greatest in the City of London . 
 = = = Varying fortunes = = = 
 The defeat and death of Richard III at Bosworth field was a double blow for the heralds , for they lost both their patron , the King , and their benefactor , the Earl Marshal , who was also slain . The victorious Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII soon after the battle . Henry 's first Parliament of 1485 passed an Act of Resumption , in which large grants of crown properties made by his two predecessors to their supporters were cancelled . Whether this act affected the status of the College 's charter is debatable ; however , the act did facilitate the de facto recovery of Coldharbour to the crown . Henry then granted the house to his mother Lady Margaret Beaufort , for life . This was because it was supposed that the house was granted personally to John <unk> the Garter King of Arms and not to the heralds as a corporation . As a result , the heralds were left destitute and many of their books and records were lost . Despite this ill treatment from the King , the heralds ' position at the royal court remained , and they were compelled by the King to attend him at all times ( albeit in rotation ) . 
 Of the reign of King Henry VIII , it has been said that : " at no time since its establishment , was [ the college ] in higher estimation , nor in fuller employment , than in this reign . " Henry VIII was fond of pomp and magnificence , and thus gave the heralds plenty of opportunity to exercise their roles in his court . In addition , the members of the College were also expected to be regularly despatched to foreign courts on missions , whether to declare war , accompany armies , summon garrisons or deliver messages to foreign potentates and generals . During his magnificent meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 , Henry VIII brought with him eighteen officers of arms , probably all he had , to regulate the many tournaments and ceremonies held there . 
 Nevertheless , the College 's petitions to the King and to the Duke of Suffolk in 1524 and 1533 for the return of their chapter house were rejected , and the heralds were left to hold chapter in whichever palace the royal court happened to be at the time . They even resorted to meeting at each other 's houses , at various <unk> and even a hospital . Furthermore , Henry VIII 's habit of raising ladies in the situation of subjects to queens , and then awarding them many heraldic augmentations , which also extended to their respective families , was considered harmful to the science of heraldry . The noted antiquarian and heraldist Charles Boutell commented in 1863 , that the : " Arms of Queen Anne Boleyn are the first which exemplify the usage , introduced by Henry VIII , of granting to his Consorts ' Augmentations ' to their paternal arms . It is a striking illustration of the degenerate condition of Heraldry under the second Tudor Sovereign . " 
 It was also in this reign in 1530 , that Henry VIII conferred on the College one of its most important duties for almost a century , the heraldic visitation . The provincial Kings of Arms were commissioned under a royal warrant to enter all houses and churches and given authority to deface and destroy all arms unlawfully used by any knight , esquire , or gentleman . Around the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries this duty became even more necessary as the monasteries were previously repositories of local genealogical records . From then on , all genealogical records and the duty of recording them was subsumed by the College . These visitations were serious affairs , and many individuals were charged and heavily fined for breaking the law of arms . Hundreds of these visitations were carried out well into the 17th century ; the last was in 1686 .

 The College found a patroness in Mary I , although it must have been embarrassing for both sides , after the heralds initially proclaimed the right of her rival Lady Jane Grey to the throne . When King Edward VI died on 6 July 1553 , Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed queen four days later , first in Cheapside then in Fleet Street by two heralds , trumpets blowing before them . However , when popular support swung to Mary 's side , the Lord Mayor of London and his councils accompanied by the Garter King of Arms , two other heralds , and four trumpeters returned to Cheapside to proclaim Mary 's ascension as rightful queen instead . The College 's excuse was that they were compelled in their earlier act by the Duke of Northumberland ( Lady Jane 's father @-@ in @-@ law , who was later executed ) , an excuse that Mary accepted . 
 The queen and her husband ( and co @-@ sovereign ) Philip II of Spain then set about granting the College a new house called Derby Place or Derby House , under a new charter , dated 18 July 1555 at Hampton Court Palace . The house was built by Thomas Stanley , 1st Earl of Derby , who married Lady Margaret Beaufort in 1482 and was created the 1st Earl of Derby in 1485 . The house was built in 1503 and was given to the Crown by the 3rd Earl in 1552 / 3 in exchange for some land . The charter stated that the house would : " enable them [ the College ] to assemble together , and consult , and agree amongst themselves , for the good of their faculty , and that the records and rolls might be more safely and conveniently deposited . " The Charter also reincorporated the three kings of arms , six heralds and all other heralds and pursuivants , and their successors , into a corporation with perpetual succession . A new seal of authority , with the College 's full coat of arms was also engraved . On 16 May 1565 , the name " the House of the Office of Arms " was used , thereafter in May 1566 " our Colledge of Armes " , and in January 1567 " our House of the College of the office of arms " . 
 Derby Place was situated in the parish of St Benedict and St Peter , south of St Paul 's Cathedral , more or less on the College 's present location . There are records of the heralds carrying out modifications to the structure of Derby Place over many years . However , little record of its appearance has survived , except the description that the buildings formed three sides of a quadrangle , entered through a gate with a portcullis on the west side . On the south range , roughly where Queen Victoria Street now stands , was a large hall on the western end . Derby Place 's hearth tax bill from 1663 , discovered in 2009 at the National Archives at Kew , showed that the building had about thirty @-@ two rooms , which were the workplace as well as the home to eleven officers of arms . 
 The reign of Mary 's sister Elizabeth I saw the College 's privileges confirmed by an Act of Parliament in 1566 . As well as the drawing up of many important internal statutes and ordinances for the College by Thomas Howard , Duke of Norfolk , the Earl Marshal , dated 18 July 1568 . The long reign saw the College distracted by the many quarrels between Garter William Dethick , Clarenceux Robert Cooke and York Herald Ralph Brooke about their rights and annulments . Disputes in which the other officers also took part , often occurred among the lesser heralds against each other . Historian Mark Noble wrote in 1805 , that these fights often involved the use of " every epithet that was disgraceful to themselves and their opponents . " and that " Their accusations against each other would fill a volume . " During these years , the College 's reputation was greatly injured in the eyes of the public . 
 The reason behind these discords were laid on the imperfect execution of the reorganisation of the College in 1568 and the uncertainty over issue of granting arms to the new and emerging gentry of the era . An enquiry into the state of the College lasted for one year , finally reporting to William Cecil , Baron Burghley in 1596 ; as a consequence , many important measures of reform for the College were made in the reign of James I. Eventually , these animosities among the heralds in the College ended only after the expulsion of one and the death of another .

 When the English Civil War began in 1642 during the reign of King Charles I , the College was divided : three king of arms , three heralds and one pursuivant sided with the King and the Royalists , while the other officers began to court the services of the Parliamentarian side . Nevertheless , the heralds petitioned Parliament in the same year , to protect their : " Books of Record , Registers , Entries , Precedents , Arms , Pedigrees and <unk> . " In 1643 the heralds joined the King at Oxford , and were with him at Naseby and followed him on all of his campaigns . Sir Edward Walker the Garter King of Arms ( from 1645 ) was even appointed , with the permission of Parliament , to act as the King 's chief secretary at the negotiations at Newport . After the execution of Charles I , Walker joined Charles II in his exile in the Netherlands . 
 Meanwhile , on 3 August 1646 the Committee of Sequestration took possession of the College premises , and kept it under its own authority . Later in October , Parliament ordered the committee to directly remove those officers whose loyalty were with the King and to nominate their own candidates to fill these vacant offices . Those officers whose loyalty remained with the King were persecuted ; first they were deprived of their offices , then of their annulments , then a fine was imposed and some were even imprisoned . In spite of this , the institutional College was protected by the Parliamentarians , and their rights and work continued unabated . Edward Bysshe a Member of Parliament from <unk> was appointed Garter , thus " Parliament which rejected its King created for itself a King of Arms " . During this time the heralds continued their work and were even present on 26 June 1657 at Oliver Cromwell 's second installation ceremony as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth . 
 = = = Survival = = = 
 On 8 May 1660 , the heralds at the command of the Convention Parliament proclaimed Charles II , King at Westminster Hall Gate . It was said that William Ryley , who was originally appointed Lancaster Herald by Charles I but then sided with Cromwell , did not even have a tabard with the Royal Arms , as his own had been " plundered in the wars " . He had to borrow a decorative one from the tomb of James I in Westminster Abbey instead ; the garment was duly returned the next day . The Restoration of Charles II , annulled all the Acts of the Parliament and all the actions of the Lord Protector , without penalising any of their supporters ( except for the regicides ) . Accordingly , all the grant of arms of the Commonwealth College was declared null and void . Furthermore , all heralds appointed during the Interregnum lost their offices , while those appointed originally by Charles I returned to their places . The exception was Edward Bysshe , who was removed as Garter , but was instead appointed Clarenceux in 1661 , much to the chagrin of Garter Edward Walker . 
 In 1666 as the Great Fire of London swept through the city , Derby Place , the College 's home since 1555 , was completely gutted and destroyed . Fortunately the College 's library was saved , and at first was stored in the Palace of Whitehall , then later moved to the Palace of Westminster , where a temporary office was opened in an apartment called the Queen 's court . An announcement was also made in the Gazette to draw public notice to the situation . Due to a shortage of funds , the planned rebuilding of a new College was delayed until 1670 . It was then that Francis Sandford , the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant and Morris Emmett , the King 's bricklayer , were together able to design and begin construction of a new structure on the old site . The costs of the rebuilding was financed in stages , and the structure was erected slowly in <unk> heralds contributed significantly out of their own pockets ; at the same time , they also sought subscriptions among the nobility , with the names of contributors recorded into a series of splendid manuscripts known as the Benefactors Books . 
 By 1683 the College part of the structure was finished . The new building was built out of plain bricks of three storeys , with basement and attic levels in addition . The College consists of an extensive range of quadrangular buildings . Apart from the hall , a porter 's lodge and a public office , the rest of the building was given over to the heralds as accommodation . To the east and south sides three terraced houses were constructed for leases , their façade in keeping with the original design . In 1699 the hall , which for some time had been used as a library , was transformed into the Earl Marshal 's Court or the Court of Chivalry ; it remains so to this day . In 1776 some stylistic changes were made to the exterior of the building and some details , such as pediments and cornices were removed , transforming the building to the then popular but austere Neo @-@ Classical style . 
 The magnificent coronation of James II in 1685 saw the College revived as an institution of state and the monarchy . However , the abrupt end of his reign saw all but one of the heralds taking the side of William of Orange and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution . The period from 1704 to 1706 saw not a single grant of arms being made by the College ; this nadir was attributed to the changes in attitude of the times . The Acts of Union 1707 between England and Scotland , in the reign of Anne did not affect the jurisdiction or the rights of the College . The College of Arms and the Court of the Lord Lyon were to exist side by side in their respective realms . However , in the matter of precedence ; the Lord Lyon , when in England , was to take immediate precedence behind Garter King of Arms . 
 = = = Comfortable decay = = = 
 The Hanoverian succession to the throne of Great Britain led to reigns with less ceremony than in any since the incorporation of the heralds . The only notable incident for the college in this period , during the reign of George I , happened in 1727 when an impostor called Robert Harman pretended to be a herald . The knave was prosecuted by the College in the county of Suffolk , and was sentenced to be pilloried in several market towns on public market days and afterwards to be imprisoned and pay a fine . This hefty sentence was executed , proving that the rights of the College were still respected . In 1737 , during the reign of George II the College petitioned for another charter , to reaffirm their rights and remuneration ; this effort proved unsuccessful . Apart from these events the influence of the College was greatly diminished . 
 In 1742 a Sugar House was built against the wall of the College . This structure was a fire risk and the cause of great anxiety among the heralds . In 1775 the College Surveyor drew attention to this problem , but to no avail . In February 1800 , the College was asked by the a Select Committee of the House of Commons to report to them the state of public records ; again the heralds drew attention to the proximity of the Sugar House . Members of the committee inspected the College premises and reported to the House that the College must either be moved to a new building or secured against the risk of fire . Again nothing was done ; in 1812 water seeped through the walls of the College damaging records . The Surveyor traced the leak back to a shed recently erected by Mr. Alderman Smith , owner of the Sugar House , who declared his readiness to do everything he could , but who actually did very little to rectify the situation . After years of negotiation the College , in 1820 , bought the Sugar House from Smith for the sum of £ 1 @,@ 500 . 
 Great financial strains placed upon the College during these times were relieved when the extravagant Prince Regent ( the future George IV ) , granted to the College an annual endowment by Royal Warrant on 29 February 1820 . This generous endowment from the crown , the first since 1555 , was applied towards the reparation and support of the College . Despite the successes of the purchase of the Sugar House and the royal endowment , the College still looked upon the possibility of moving its location to a more suitable and fashionable place . John Nash was at the same time laying out his plans for a new London , and , in 1822 , the College , through the Deputy Earl Marshal , asked the government for a portion of land in the new districts on which to build a house to keep their records . A petition from the College was given to the Lords of the Treasury setting out the herald 's reason for the move : " that the local situation of the College is so widely detached from the proper scene of the official duties and occupations of Your <unk> and from the residences of that class of persons by whom the records in their charge are chiefly and most frequently consulted . " 
 Nash himself was asked by the College to design a new building near fashionable Trafalgar Square but Nash 's elaborate plan proved too costly and ambitious for the College . At the same time the College also asked Robert Abraham to submit to them a second plan for the building . When Nash heard that another architect was approached behind his back he reacted vehemently , and attacked the heralds . The College nevertheless continued with their plans . However they were constantly beset by conflicts between the different officers over the amount needed to build a new building . By 1827 the college still had no coherent plan ; the Duke of Norfolk ordered the College to drop the matter altogether . By 1842 the heralds were reconciled with their location and once again commissioned Abraham to build a new octagonal @-@ shaped Record Room on the site of the old Sugar House . 
 In 1861 a proposal was made to construct a road from Blackfriars to the Mansion House ; this would have resulted in the complete demolition of the College . However , protests from the heralds resulted in only parts of the south east and south west wings being sliced off , requiring extensive remodelling . The College was now a three @-@ sided building with an open courtyard facing the New Queen Victoria Street laid out in 1866 . The terrace , steps and entrance porch were also added around this time . 
 = = = Reform = = = 
 On 18 October 1869 , a warrant for a commission of inquiry into the state of the College was established . The warrant issued on the behalf of the Duke of Norfolk , stated : " that it is desirable that the College of Arms should be visited , and an inquiry instituted with the view of ascertaining whether the Rules and Orders for the good government of the said College ... are duly obeyed and fulfilled ... and whether by change of circumstances or any other cause , any new Laws , Ordinances or Regulations are necessary to be made ... for the said College . " The commission had three members : Lord Edward Fitzalan @-@ Howard ( the Deputy Earl Marshal ) , Sir William Alexander ( Queen 's Counsel ) and Edward <unk> ( a Sergeant at Law ) . Sir Bernard Burke ( of the famous Burke 's Peerage ) , at the time Ulster King of Arms , gave the commission the advice that the College should : " be made a Government Department , let its Officers receive fixed salaries from Government , and let all its fees be paid into the public exchequer . This arrangement would , I am sure , be self @-@ supporting and would raise at once the character of the Office and the status of the Heralds . " Burke 's suggestion for reform was the same arrangement that had already been applied to the Lord Lyon Court in Scotland in 1867 , and was to be applied to his own office in 1871 . However unlike the Lyon Court , which was a court of law and part of the Scottish Judiciary , the College of Arms has always been an independent corporate body overseen by the Earl Marshal . While the Lord Lyon depended on the Government for its reforms and statutes , the College has always been able to carry out changes from within itself . The commission also drew attention to the fees , annulments and library of the College , as well as the general modernisation of the chapter as a whole . When the commission made its report in 1870 , it recommended many changes , and these were duly made in another warrant dated 27 April 1871 . Burke 's recommendation , however , was not implemented . 
 Despite the findings of this inquiry , the issues surrounding the status and position of the College continued . At the beginning of the 20th century these issues were once again brought to the forefront . In 1903 an inquiry was set up at the instructions of Arthur Balfour , soon to be Prime Minister . The committee of inquiry was to consist of eight members , Sir Algernon West was made chairman . They were tasked to investigate " the constitution , duties and administration of the Heralds ' College " . The main issues being the anomalous position of the College , who are theoretically officials of the Royal Household , but actually derive their income from fees paid by private individuals for their services . Some of the members of the committee ( a minority ) wanted ( like Burke thirty @-@ four years earlier ) to make officers of the College of Arms into " salaried civil servants of the state " . Despite concluding that some form of change was necessary , the inquiry categorically stated that any changes " is at the present time and in present circumstances impracticable . " In 1905 the generous endowment from the Crown ( as instituted by George IV ) was stopped by the Liberal Government of the day as part of its campaign against the House of Lords and the class system . 
 A second inquiry was established in 1928 under the chairmanship of Lord Birkenhead . The inquiry was called soon after a secret memorandum , written in 1927 , was circulated by the Home Office , criticising the constitution and workings of the heralds . The memorandum states that " They have , as will be seen from this memorandum , in many cases attempted to interfere with the exercise by the Secretary of State of his constitutional responsibility for advising the Crown " , and that the College had " adopted practices in connection with matters within their jurisdiction which seem highly improper in themselves , and calculated to bring the Royal Prerogative into contempt . " These accusations concern the actions of certain heralds , who <unk> advocate the cases of their paid clients , even against the opposition of the ministers of the day . Sir Anthony Wagner writes that " The officers of these departments , no doubt , in the overconfident way of their generation , esteemed the College an anachronistic and anomalous institution overdue for reform or abolition . " The memorandum ended by saying that " the College of Arms is a small and highly organised luxury trade , dependent for its living on supplying the demand for a fancy article among the well to do : and like many such trades it has in very many cases to create the demand before it can supply it . " 
 When the committee made their report in June 1928 they suggested several reforms to tackle the main issues which had brought the College into so much conflict with the Home Office . Firstly they concluded that the fees systems were adequate and no change was necessary in that regard . They justified this by stating that " placing all or even a few of the Officers on a fixed salary outweigh any advantages which might be expected to result from the change . " Secondly they concluded that from now on the College was to be entirely subordinated to the Home Office , and that a standing inter @-@ departmental committee be established to settle any future conflicts .

 In 1934 , on the 450th anniversary of the incorporation of the College of Arms , an exhibition was held at the College of the herald 's principal treasures and other associated interests . The exhibition was opened by the Earl Marshal and ran from 28 June to 26 July , during which time it received more than 10 @,@ 000 visitors , including King George VI and Queen Elizabeth . 
 In 1939 at the beginning of the Second World War the College 's records were moved to Thornbury Castle in Gloucestershire , the home of Major Algar Howard ( the Norroy King of Arms ) . Meanwhile , on 10 and 11 May 1941 the College building was almost consumed by fire , which had already levelled all the buildings to the east of the College on Queen Victoria Street . The building was given up for lost , when a change in the wind saved it . At the end of the war , all of the records were returned safely to the College . 
 In 1943 the College was given new responsibilities when the office of Ulster King of Arms was annexed and combined with those of the Norroy King of Arms , creating a new office called Norroy and Ulster King of Arms ; Sir Algar Howard thus became the first to hold this office . 
 Although the College building was saved from the war , its walls and roof were left in a perilous state . In 1954 a decision was forced upon heralds , whether to abandon the old building ( which would have been profitable financially ) or repair it on a scale far beyond the College 's resources . Eventually with the help of the Ministry of Works and a public subscription , the building was repaired in time for the College 's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place . The present gates to the building were added in 1956 , and came originally from Goodrich Court in Herefordshire . The new gates displayed the College 's arms and crest . 
 In the year of the quincentenary of the incorporation of the College of Arms , the College held a special service of thanksgiving at St Benet Paul 's Wharf ( the College 's official church since 1555 ) on 2 March 1984 . The Kings of Arms , Heralds and Pursuivants , ordinary and extraordinary , of the College in full uniform processed from the College towards the church together with Queen Elizabeth II , the Duke of Norfolk , the Earl Marshal and the Earl of Arundel the Deputy Earl Marshal . 
 On 5 February 2009 a fire broke out at the west wing on the third and fourth floor of the College building . Eight London Fire Brigade fire engines were able to bring the flames under control , in the meantime 35 people were evacuated from the building and a further 100 from adjacent buildings . Fortunately no records or books of the College were damaged . Repairs to the smoke @-@ damaged rooms and exterior brickwork were completed in December 2009 .

 The College of Arms is a part of the Royal Household of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom , as such they serve the monarch by accompanying her on various state occasions . These occasions are centred on the institution of the monarchy as the symbol of the state , and the expression of majesty and power through public pomp and ceremony . Presently the heralds turn out their full uniforms only twice a year ; during the State Opening of Parliament and during the early summer at the Garter Service at Windsor Castle . The organisation and planning of all State ceremonies falls within the prerogative of the Earl Marshal , the College 's chief . As a result , the heralds have a role to perform within every significant royal ceremony . 
 State Opening of Parliament takes place annually at the Houses of Parliament . The heralds , including both ordinary and extraordinary officers , form the front part of the Royal Procession , preceding the Sovereign and other Great Officers of State . The procession starts at the bottom of the Victoria Tower , then up the Norman Porch to the <unk> Chamber . Once the Sovereign has put on the Imperial State Crown , the heralds lead her once again through the Royal Gallery into the House of Lords , where they remain with her during her speech and accompany her until she leaves the Palace . 
 Garter Service or Garter Day is held every June on the Monday of Royal Ascot week . The annual service takes place at St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle . On this day new Companions of the Order of the Garter are personally invested with their insignia at the Throne Room of Windsor Castle by the Sovereign . All the members then have lunch , wearing their blue velvet robes and black velvet hats with white plumes at the Waterloo Chamber . Afterwards the members make their way on foot from the Upper Ward of the castle towards St George 's Chapel . During their procession they are led by members of the College of Arms in their tabards , the Military Knights of Windsor and contingents of the Sovereign 's Bodyguard . After the service , the members return to the Upper Ward by carriage . This ceremony is especially significant for the Garter King of Arms , the senior officer of the College , who is an officer of the Order . 
 The participation of these two annual ceremonies are considered the least time @-@ consuming part of the herald 's roles . However at other times they are involved in some of the most important ceremonies concerning the life of the British monarch . After the death of a Sovereign the Accession Council ( made up of Privy Councillors and other officers such as the Lord Mayor of London ) meets at St. James 's Palace to make a formal proclamation of the accession of the next Sovereign . The traditional method of publishing the council 's proclamation recognising the new monarch is by way of it being physically read out . This task is assigned to the various members of the College by way of the Earl Marshal , who receives the text of the proclamation from the council in person . The proclamation is to be read at several locations in London . Traditionally the first reading is made from the Friary Court balcony at St James 's Palace . Another reading and ceremony is held at the Temple Bar . There a detachment of heralds , accompanied by troops of the Royal Horse Guards , formally demand admission to the precinct of the City of London from the City Marshall and City <unk> . The barrier , consisting of a silken rope ( in place of the ancient bar ) was then removed and the detachment would march forward to meet the Lord Mayor and City Sheriffs , where the proclamation would be read . Other readings by members of the College also occur at the corner of Chancery Lane , in Fleet Street , and at the Royal Exchange . 
 During the Coronation Ceremony , members of the College form part of the Royal procession as it enters Westminster Abbey . The members of the College walk in the procession in virtue of them being Her Majesty 's " Kings , Heralds and Pursuivants of Arms of England . " They do so alongside their Scottish colleagues : the Lord Lyon , the Heralds and Pursuivants of Arms of the Lyon Court . The Garter King of Arms is usually placed next to the Lord Great Chamberlain in the procession , he has the duty of guiding , but not performing the ceremony . Garter 's duties during the coronation ceremony are therefore not unlike those of a Master of Ceremonies . It is only during this ceremony that the Kings of Arms are allowed to wear their distinctive crowns , the only group of individuals , apart from the King and Queen , authorised to do so . 
 At State funerals the heralds once again take their place at the front of the royal procession as it enters the place of worship . Historically during the procession of royal funerals ( usually of the Sovereign ) the heralds would carry a piece of armour , representing the various marks of chivalry . These included the helm and crest , spurs , gauntlet , target ( shield of arms ) , sword and a literal ' coat of arms ' ( a heraldic surcoat ) . This procession of chivalry was an integral part of the heraldic royal funeral . One of the most solemn role for the heralds during a royal funeral is the reading of the full list of the styles and titles of the deceased . On 9 April 2002 , Garter King of Arms Peter Gwynn @-@ Jones read out the full styles and 437 titles of Queen Elizabeth , The Queen Mother at the end of her funeral service at Westminster Abbey . 
 = = = Granting and proving descent of arms = = = 
 The granting of coat of arms within the United Kingdom is the sole prerogative of the British monarch . However , she has delegated this power to two authorities ; the Lord Lyon , with jurisdiction over Scotland and the College of Arms over England , Wales and Northern Ireland . Under the latter 's jurisdiction , the right to arms is acquired exclusively either by proving descent in an unbroken male @-@ line from someone registered as so entitled or by a new grant from the King of Arms . These are the most common way of gaining this right , however technically arms can also be gained : by a grant from the Crown , by prescription ( meaning in use since time immemorial ) , by succeeding to an office or by marriage . The descent of arms follow strongly the Law of heraldic arms , which is a branch of English law , interpreted by civil lawyers in the Court of Chivalry . Sir Edward Coke in his Commentary upon Littleton ( 1628 ) wrote that " gentry and armes is the nature of <unk> , for they descend to all the sonnes . " Arms in England , therefore descend to all of the male lines , and not just the most senior alone ( unlike in Scotland ) . 
 When a new grant of arms is to be made , it is granted through a Letters Patent . The Crown delegates all of this authority to the King of Arms , however before any letters can be issued they must have a warrant from the Earl Marshal agreeing to the granting of arms . This has been the case since 1673 , when the authority of the Earl Marshal , which the heralds had challenged , was established by a royal declaration stating , among other things , that no patents of arms should be granted without his consent . This established the present system whereby royal authority to approve candidates for grants of arms is exercised by the Earl Marshal , and royal authority to grant the arms themselves is exercised by the Kings of Arms . Firstly a petition is submitted , called a memorial , to the Earl Marshal . This memorial will be drawn up for the petitioner by an officer of arms , if it is felt that such a petition would be accepted . Currently there are no set criteria for eligibility for a grant of arms , the College recommends that " awards or honours from the Crown , civil or military commissions , university degrees , professional qualifications , public and charitable services , and eminence or good standing in national or local life " will be taken into account . 
 In the past this issue of eligibility have been a source of great conflict between the heralds , as such submissions are made on an officer for clients basis , which meant some ' unsuitability ' was ignored in lieu of profit by past officers . <unk> rested on the phrase " eminent men " , originally the test applied was one of wealth or social status , as any man entitled to bear a coat of arms was expected to be a gentleman . By 1530 , the heralds applied a property qualification , requiring successful candidates for a grant of arms to have an income from land of £ 10 per annum , or movable wealth of £ 300 . However this has not been the case , in 1616 Ralph Brooke , York Herald , tricked Garter King of Arms , William Segar , into granting a coat of arms to Gregory Brandon , a common hangman , for a fee of 22 shillings . When the king found out he had them both imprisoned at Marshalsea , they were freed a few days later . 
 The fee for the grant of arms is due when the memorial is submitted , the amount being laid out in the Earl Marshal 's Warrant . As of 1 January 2016 the fees for a personal grant of arms , including a crest is £ 5 @,@ 750 , a grant to a non @-@ profit body is £ 12 @,@ 100 and to a commercial company is £ 17 @,@ 950 . This grant however does not include a grant of a badge , supporters or a standard , their inclusion into the grant requires extra fees . The fees mainly go towards commissioning the artwork and calligraphy on the vellum Letters Patent , which must be done by hand and in a sense a work of art in itself , plus other administrative costs borne by the heralds and for the upkeep of the College . 
 Once the Earl Marshal has approved the petition he will issue his Warrant to the King of Arms , this will allow them to proceed with the granting of the arms . It is during this stage that the designing and formation of the arms begin . Although the King of Arms has full discretion over the composition of the arms , he will take into full account the wishes of the applicant . These will include allusions and references to the applicant 's life and achievements . The design of any new coat of arms must abide by all the rules of heraldry as well as being entirely original and distinct from all previous arms recorded at the College 's archives . A preliminary sketch will then be approved and sent to the petitioner for approval . 
 As soon as the composition of the blazon is agreed to by both parties a final grant could then be created . This takes the form of a handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent . The letter is written and painted in vellum by a College artist and <unk> . The grant is then signed and seal by the King of Arms , it is then handed to the petitioner , authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs . A copy of the grant is always made for the College 's own register . 
 Once granted , a coat of arms becomes the hereditary and inheritable property of the owner and his descendants . However , this can only be so if the inheritor is a legitimate male @-@ line descendent of the person originally granted with the arms . To establish the right to arms by descent , one must be able to prove that an ancestor had his arms recorded in the registers of the College . If there is a possibility of such an inheritance , one must first make contact with an officer @-@ in @-@ waiting at the College , who could then advise on the course of action and the cost of such a search . The research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry , which will involve the examination of genealogical records . The first step involve a search of the family name in the College 's archives , as coats of arms and family name has no connection , the officer could prove , through this method , that there is in fact no descent . However , if a connection is found a genealogical research outside of the College 's archives would then be undertaken in order to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual . 
 = = = Change of names = = = 
 The College of Arms is also an authorised location for enrolling a change of name . In common law there is no obligation to undergo any particular formality in order to change one 's name . However , it is possible to execute a deed poll , more specifically a deed of change of name , as a demonstration of intention to adopt and henceforth use a new name , and deeds poll may be enrolled either in the High Court or in the College . On being enrolled the deed is customarily ' gazetted ' , that is published in the London Gazette . The deed poll is not entered on the registers , but is still published , if the name change only affects one 's given name . 
 = = = Change of name and arms = = = 
 It is also possible to change one 's coat of arms , with or without adopting or appending a new surname , by Royal Licence , that is to say a licence in the form of a warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name . Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction ( a requirement in a will ) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms . The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College . Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary . 
 = = = Genealogical records = = = 
 Due to the inheritable nature of coats of arms the College have also been involved in Genealogy since the 15th century . The College regularly conduct genealogical research for individuals with families in the British Isles of all social classes . As the College is also the official repository of genealogical materials such as pedigree charts and family trees . The College 's extensive records within this realm of study dates back over five centuries . An individual could , if he so wishes , have his family 's pedigree placed inside the College 's records . This would require the services of an officer of the College who would then draft a pedigree . The officer would ensure that the pedigree was in the correct format and also advise the client on the documentary evidences necessary to supports such a draft . After this is done , the officer would submit the pedigree to a chapter of two other officers , who would then examine the pedigree for any mistakes or in some cases demand more research . After this examination is completed the pedigree would then be <unk> and placed into the pedigree register of the College . 
 = = = Roll of the Peerage = = = 
 The House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to a seat in the House of Lords . Prior to the passage of this Act , anyone succeeding to a title in the peerage of England , Scotland , Ireland , Great Britain and the United Kingdom , would prove their succession by a writ of summons to Parliament . All peers receiving such writs were enrolled in the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal , a document maintained by the Clerk of the Parliaments . As a result of the Act , the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal only records the name of life peers and the 92 hereditary peers left in the House of Lords . This meant that the register was incomplete as it excludes most of the other hereditary peers , who are not part of the House of Lords . 
 On 1 June 2004 a Royal Warrant issued by Queen Elizabeth II states " that it is desirable for a full record to be kept of all of Our subjects who are Peers " , this new record would be named the Roll of the Peerage . The warrant was later published in the London Gazette on 11 June 2004 . The warrant handed the responsibility of maintaining the roll to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs , in 2007 this responsibility was assumed by the Crown Office within the newly created Ministry of Justice . The warrant also stipulated that the Secretary of State would act in consultation with the Garter King of Arms and the Lord Lyon King of Arms . The roll would then be published by the College of Arms , currently an online edition is available . 
 = = Earl Marshal = = 
 The Earl Marshal is one of the Great Officers of State , and the office has existed since 1386 . Many of the holders of the office have been related to each other however it was not until 1672 that the office became fully hereditary . In that year Henry Howard was appointed to the position by King Charles II , in 1677 he also succeeded to the Dukedom of Norfolk as the 6th Duke , thus combining the two titles for his successors . 
 The office originates from that of Marshal , one of the English monarch 's chief military officers . As such he became responsible for all matters concerning war and together with the Lord High Constable held the joint post as judges of the Court of Chivalry . After the decline of medieval chivalry , the role of Earl Marshal came to concern all matters of state and royal ceremonies . By the 16th century this supervision came to include the College of Arms and its heralds . Thus the Earl Marshal became the head and chief of the College of Arms ; all important matters concerning its governance , including the appointment of new heralds , must meet with his approval . The Earl Marshal also has authority over the flying of flags within England and Wales , as does Lord Lyon King of Arms in Scotland . The Officers of Arms at the College of Arms maintain the only official registers of national and other flags and they advise national and local Government , and other bodies and individuals , on the flying of flags . 
 = = = Court of Chivalry = = = 
 The High Court of Chivalry or the Earl Marshal 's Court is a specialised civil court in England , presided over by the Earl Marshal . The first references made about the court was in 1348 . The court has jurisdiction over all matters relating to heraldry as it legalises and enforce decisions of the College of Arms . The court considers all cases relating to questions of status , including disputes over social rank and the law of arms , for example complaints on the infringement of the use of another individual 's coat of arms . The Court of Chivalry meets on the premises of the College of Arms , however the last time it met was in 1954 , the first time in 230 years . 
 = = Heralds of the College = = 
 The College of Arms is a corporation of thirteen heralds , styled Officers in Ordinary . This thirteen can be divided hierarchically into three distinctive ranks : three Kings of Arms , six Heralds of Arms and four Pursuivants of Arms . There are also presently seven Officers Extraordinary , who take part in ceremonial occasions but are not part of the College . As members of the Royal Household , the heralds are appointed at the pleasure of the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Earl Marshal . The Officers in Ordinary are appointed by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm , and the Officers Extraordinary by Royal Sign Manual ; all appointments are announced in the London Gazette . 
 All of the officers in Ordinary of the College were first instituted at different dates ( some even before the incorporation of the College ) , some originating as private servants of noblemen , some being Royal from the start . They take their names and badges from the titles and royal badges of the monarchs of England . The officers Extraordinary , however take their names from the titles and estates of the Earl Marshal , they were also created at different dates for ceremonial purposes . 
 = = = Wages = = = 
 The College is almost entirely self @-@ financed , and is not a recipient of any regular public funding . Its officers do have official salaries , which are paid for by the Crown . The salaries of the officers were raised during the reign of King James I , but were reduced under William IV . These salaries per annum reflected the living costs of the day ; however today the amount is seen only as nominal payment . In addition to their official duties , the heralds have for many centuries undertaken private practice in heraldry and genealogy , for which professional fees are charged . 
 = = = Uniforms = = = 
 The most recognisable item of the herald 's wardrobe has always been their tabards . Since the 13th century , records of this distinctive garment were apparent . At first it is likely that the herald wore his master 's cast @-@ off coat , but even from the beginning that would have had special significance , signifying that he was in effect his master 's representative . Especially when his master was a sovereign prince , the wearing of his coat would haven given the herald a natural diplomatic status . John Anstis wrote that : " The Wearing the outward Robes of the Prince , hath been esteemed by the Consent of Nations , to be an extraordinary Instance of Favour and Honour , as in the Precedent of Mordecai , under a king of Persia . " The last King of England to have worn a tabard with his arms was probably King Henry VII . Today the herald 's tabard is a survivor of history , much like the judges ' wigs and ( until the last century ) the bishop 's gaiters . 
 The tabards of the different officers can be distinguished by the type of fabric used to make them . A tabard of a King of Arms is made of velvet and cloth of gold , the tabard of a Herald of satin and that of a Pursuivant of damask silk . The tabards of all heralds ( Ordinary and Extraordinary ) are inscribed with the Sovereign 's royal arms , richly embroidered . It was once the custom for pursuivants to wear their tabards with the sleeves at the front and back , in fact in 1576 a pursuivant was fined for presuming to wear his tabard like a herald but this practice was ended during the reign of James II . Until 1888 all tabards was provided to the heralds by the Crown , however in that year a parsimonious Treasury refused to ask Parliament for funds for the purpose . Ever since then heralds either paid for their own tabards or bought the one used by their predecessors . The newest tabard was made in 1963 for the Welsh Herald Extraordinary . A stock of them is now held by the Lord Chamberlain , from which a loan " during tenure of office " is made upon each appointment . They are often sent to Ede & Ravenscroft for repair or replacement . In addition , heralds and pursuivants wear black velvet caps with a badge embroidered . 
 Apart from the tabards , the heralds also wear scarlet court uniforms with gold embroidery during formal events ; with white breeches and stockings for coronations and black for all other times together with black patent court shoes with gold buckles ( the Scottish heralds wear black wool serge military style trousers with wide gold oak leaf lace on the side seams and black patent ankle boots ; or for women , a long black skirt ) . The heralds are also entitled to distinctive sceptres , which have been a symbol of their office since the Tudor period . In 1906 new sceptres were made , most likely the initiative of Sir Alfred Scott @-@ Gatty . These take the form of short black batons with gilded ends , each with a representation of the badges of the different offices of the heralds . In 1953 these were replaced by white staves , with gilded metal handles and at its head a blue dove in a golden coronet or a " martinet " . These blue <unk> are derived from the arms of the College . Another of the heralds ' insignia of office is the Collar of SS , which they wear over their uniforms . During inclement weather , a large black cape is worn . At state funerals , they would wear a wide sash of black silk <unk> over their tabards ( in ancient times , they would have worn long black hooded cloaks under their tabards ) . 
 The three Kings of Arms have also been entitled to wear a crown since the 13th century . However , it was not until much later that the specific design of the crown was regulated . The silver @-@ gilt crown is composed of sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height , inscribed with a line from Psalm 51 in Latin : Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam <unk> tuam ( translated : Have mercy on me O God according to Thy great mercy ) . Within the crown is a cap of crimson velvet , lined with ermine , having at the top a large tuft of tassels , wrought in gold . In medieval times the king of arms were required to wear their crowns and attend to the Sovereign on four high feasts of the year : Christmas , Easter , Whitsuntide and All Saint 's Day . Today , the crown is reserved for the most solemn of occasions . The last time these crowns were worn was at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 . At other times , kings of arms wear a black bicorne trimmed with white ostrich feathers when performing duties outdoors , or a black velvet cap , depending on circumstances of occasion . 
 The New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary is a special case when it comes to uniform . Although they do wear the tabard , they only do so when in the UK performing duties . When in New Zealand , they simply wear morning dress as official uniform , together with their chains and baton . 
 = = = Qualifications = = = 
 There are no formal qualifications for a herald , but certain specialist knowledge and discipline are required . Most of the current officers are trained lawyers and historians . Noted heraldist and writer Sir John Ferne wrote in The Glory of <unk> in 1586 that a herald " ought to be a Gentlemen and an Old man not admitting into that sacred office <unk> <unk> , painter & <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> of Armes : for to the office of a herald is requisite the skill of many faculties and professions of literature , and likewise the knowledge of <unk> . " Some of the greatest scholars and eminent antiquarians of their age were members of the College , such as Robert Glover , William Camden , Sir William Dugdale , Elias Ashmole , John Anstis , Sir Anthony Wagner and John Brooke @-@ Little . 
 Even with these examples , many controversial appointments were made throughout the College 's history . For example , in 1704 the architect and dramatist Sir John Vanbrugh was appointed Clarenceux King of Arms , although he knew little of heraldry and genealogy and was known to have ridiculed both . Nevertheless , he was also described as " possibly the most distinguished man who has ever worn a herald 's tabard . " Noted antiquarian William Oldys , appointed Norroy King of Arms in 1756 , was described as being " rarely sober in the afternoon , never after supper " , and " much addicted to low company " .

 = Pétrus ( restaurant ) = 
 Pétrus is a restaurant in London , which serves Modern French cuisine . It is located in Kinnerton Street , Belgravia and is part of Gordon Ramsay restaurants owned by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay 's <unk> Limited . It has held one Michelin star since 2011 , and five AA Rosettes . Controversy arose when the star was first awarded . It has received mixed reviews from food critics both while in its current incarnation , and while it was run by head chef Marcus Wareing . It was felt that the dishes were sometimes overcomplicated , and designed primarily to gain Michelin stars . The restaurant was named after the French wine Pétrus . 
 It is now in its third location , and used to be located in St James 's Street , London , and The Berkeley hotel , where it was run by head chef Wareing . By the time Pétrus ' lease ran out in September 2008 , it held two Michelin stars under Wareing . This resulted in a public feud between Wareing and Ramsay as Wareing took over Pétrus ' former location in the hotel , opening his restaurant Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley , while Ramsay retained the rights to the Pétrus name . 
 = = Description = = 
 The current Pétrus restaurant is located in 1 Kinnerton Street , Belgravia , London , where it was opened on 29 March 2010 under Head Chef Sean Burbidge . He had worked in other Gordon Ramsay restaurants including Restaurant Gordon Ramsay and Gordon Ramsay au Trianon , but it is his first position as head chef . 
 The interior of the restaurant has been designed by the Russell Sage Studio , who also worked on other Ramsay establishments , The Savoy Grill and the York and Albany . The claret red theme of previous incarnations of the restaurant has been maintained , and was coupled in the design with leather and polished metalwork . The layout includes a chef 's table for six people which overlooks the kitchen . The wine list includes more than 2 @,@ 000 bottles of wine , and includes 34 different vintages of the French wine Pétrus . They are located in a circular glass room located in the middle of the dining room . 
 = = = Menu = = = 
 The menu at Pétrus is split into several fixed price menus , containing modern French cuisine . It has been described by Zoe Williams as being distinctly Gordon Ramsay in composition , despite the influences of head chef Sean Burbidge . The meals come with an amuse @-@ bouche , a pre @-@ starter course , and after dinner chocolates in addition to the items listed on the menus themselves . A number of pan fried fish dishes have been on the menu , including mackerel with tomato chutney and a niçoise salad , and a sea bream course served with brown shrimp , samphire and an oyster velouté sauce . Further seafood related dishes include a langoustine and watercress soup entrée which was praised by food critic Jay Rayner . Sauces are generally delivered to the table in small jugs and are poured tableside . 
 Elements of the dessert course are served on dry ice , such as small round white chocolate balls of ice cream , which has been taken from the menu at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay . Other desserts on the menu include a hollow sphere of chocolate , which a hot chocolate sauce is poured over to dissolve the sphere in order to unveil the ball of milk ice cream within , and a fennel crème brûlée served with Alphonso mango . The wine list starts from around £ 25 , and moves up to a 1961 magnum of Pétrus at £ 39 @,@ 000 . 
 = = History = = 
 Pétrus was opened in March 1999 as a joint venture between chef Gordon Ramsay and his father @-@ in @-@ law Chris Hutcheson as Ramsay 's second restaurant after Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea . It was opened at 33 St James 's Street , London , on 22 March 1999 under head chef Marcus Wareing . The name came from the French wine Pétrus , which was Ramsay 's and Wareing 's favourite . Whilst located at St James 's Street , it was nearby L 'Oranger , which Wareing had run for A @-@ Z Restaurants , which reopened shortly after Pétrus , but with Wareing 's former sous chef as head chef . 
 Giorgio Locatelli allegedly caused criminal damage to the restaurant later in 1999 by spitting at the wallpaper , resulting in an estimated £ 1 @,@ 300 worth of damage , however the case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service . In July 2001 , the expenditure of a group of six investment bankers at Pétrus made national news in the UK . Together they spent more than £ 44 @,@ 000 on wine , resulting in the restaurant giving them £ 400 worth of food for nothing . 
 In 2003 , Gordon Ramsay Holdings took over location was used to be used by the restaurant <unk> at The Berkeley hotel in Knightsbridge , London . Ramsay signalled his intention to move Wareing and Pétrus into the location after the arrangements between chef Jean @-@ Georges <unk> and the Savoy Group were not renewed . This resulted in both restaurants at The Berkeley coming under Ramsay 's control . The restaurant was one of those run by Ramsay that he imposed a smoking ban in from 2004 onwards . 
 In May 2008 , it was announced that the hotel intended to work directly with Wareing rather than through Gordon Ramsay Holdings , as the lease on Pétrus ' location inside the Berkeley Hotel was due to lapse in September 2008 . This deal resulted in a public war of words between Wareing and Ramsey , with Wareing opening his restaurant Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley in the space previously occupied by Pétrus , and Ramsay 's holding company retaining the rights to the Pétrus name . Wareing described his new venture as being a renaming of Pétrus . Originally it was expected that the name would be transferred to another restaurant already held by the company . A spokesperson for the Michelin Guide stated that Pétrus ' Michelin stars would stay with the property , expecting " that things will change very little " when it was reviewed for the 2009 guide . Before Pétrus closed at The Berkeley to be rebranded , all of the potential customers in the reservations book were contacted to say that their reservations had been cancelled and to offer them a place at another Ramsay restaurant . 
 Wareing later criticised Pétrus when it reopened at 1 Kinnerton Street , and said that while any restaurant could be named after a bottle of wine , the real Pétrus remained his restaurant despite the name change . The new location was nearby the former premises , but the menu was described as being distinctly " Gordon " rather than " Marcus " . Jean @-@ Philippe <unk> , who was the Maître d 'hôtel for five years at Pétrus in the Berkeley , moved over with the restaurant to the new location . Pétrus has a twenty @-@ year lease at Kinnerton Street . 
 Following the sacking of Hutcheson by Ramsay from Gordon Ramsay Holdings , Hutcheson attempted to take control of Pétrus in its new location as he argued that he had listed himself as sole shareholder of the company " Pétrus ( Kinnerton Street ) " on the documentation filed with Companies House in April 2010 . The issue was settled when Ramsay bought out Hutcheson 's stake in Gordon Ramsay Holdings , and transferring the restaurant to Ramsay 's new company , <unk> Limited . In June 2014 , Neil Snowball took over from Sean Burbridge as head chef at the restaurant . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Tracey Macleod ate at Pétrus for The Independent shortly after it opened in 1999 . She thought that certain touches would impress the Michelin inspectors , and that the dishes were suitably elaborate . Jay Rayner visited the restaurant whilst it was at the <unk> Hotel in 2003 for The Observer . He thought that the menu was over complicated , and not all the elements of the dishes worked together . Gillian Glover of The Scotsman thought in 2005 that some of the food served was forgettable , but stand out elements included frog leg <unk> which came with her main course of baked seabass with garlic puree . 
 Zoe Williams reviewed the restaurant for The Daily Telegraph in 2010 , after Burbidge became head chef . She found issues with some of the dishes , such as a mackerel which wasn 't properly filleted , and some overcooked samphire . However she thought that the dessert was perfect , stating that " It was enough to make you wonder why anybody ever makes custard without fennel " . Fay Maschler visited the new establishment in April 2010 for the Evening Standard , who disagreed with the idea that it was a reopening and said that it instead should be considered to be a new Ramsay restaurant . She was impressed by the majority of the food , especially the desserts , however felt that the service was a little alien . Marina O 'Loughlin for the Metro in June 2010 , thought that the food was fine and although the restaurant seems to have been entirely designed with gathering Michelin stars , it seemed that everything on the menu had been done somewhere else but better . Time Out 's review of the restaurant rated it at four out of five stars , being impressed with the quality of the food and describing the wine selection as " crammed with class " . 
 = = = Ratings and awards = = = 
 The restaurant won its first Michelin star under Wareing in 2000 , and was awarded a second star in 2007 . It became only the fifth London based restaurant to hold stars at that level . Following the split with Wareing , the restaurant at the new location gained a new single Michelin star in the 2011 list . 
 Whilst under Wareing 's lead , the restaurant was rated the best overall restaurant in London by restaurant guide Harden 's in 2008 , but was beaten by Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in the best food and service rankings in the £ 80 + bracket . However , in 2009 , it was ranked once more the best overall in London , and in those categories as well . 
 It holds five AA Rosettes . However , in 2002 editor Simon Wright resigned as he believed that the managing director of The Automobile Association intervened to prevent Pétrus from receiving a fifth rosette at the recommendation of the AA 's inspectors . Ramsay reacted by threatening to take legal action in order to ensure that none of his restaurants were featured in the 2003 edition of the AA 's restaurant guide . This was followed by the resignation of inspector Sarah Peart over the same issue . The AA eventually relented and awarded Pétrus five rosettes . Wareing said of the issue at the time , " I 'm delighted to get the fifth rosette , it 's a great achievement . Every AA inspector believed we deserved five rosettes , it was only the guy at the top , Roger Wood , who didn 't . As far as I know , he still has not eaten at Pétrus and I would not welcome him here now . "

Florida State University ( FSU ) defeated Virginia Tech 27 – 22 in a game characterized by penalties , defense , and a fourth @-@ quarter comeback attempt by Virginia Tech . The game was the final contest of the regular season for the two teams , as bowl games are not considered part of the regular season . In addition , the contest marked the inaugural championship game for the recently expanded conference . 
 Virginia Tech entered the 2005 season having won the 2004 ACC Championship , the last to be awarded without playing a championship game at the end of the season . Tech won its first eight games and appeared to be on course to have an untroubled run to the ACC Championship Game .

 Florida State earned its bid to the ACC Championship game by fighting through an Atlantic Division schedule that included several nationally ranked teams . After defeating ninth @-@ ranked Miami in their opening contest , the Seminoles won their next four games before losing at Virginia in a close match . Additional losses to North Carolina State and Clemson at the end of the season almost eliminated the Seminoles from contention for a spot in the championship game , but losses by Clemson and the other Atlantic Division leaders gave the Seminoles a second chance and set up an ACC Championship game between Florida State and Virginia Tech . The two teams had previously played in the 2000 National Championship Game , and the rematch served as a point of public interest . 
 The first two quarters of the game were characterized by defense and penalties that stifled both teams ' offenses . In the second half , Florida State took advantage of a punt return for a touchdown to begin a third @-@ quarter surge . Although Virginia Tech made a late @-@ game comeback , Florida State ran out the clock and secured a 27 – 22 victory . Florida State 's win earned it the 2005 ACC Championship and a bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl against Penn State . Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the 2006 Gator Bowl against Louisville . Following that game , Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was released from the team due to repeated violations of team rules and several legal infractions .

 The ACC Championship Game traditionally matches the winner of the Coastal and Atlantic Divisions of the Atlantic Coast Conference . Prior to 2005 , no championship game existed . The idea for a championship game originated with the league 's 2004 expansion , which added former Big East members Miami , Virginia Tech , and ( in 2005 ) Boston College . A request to the National Collegiate Athletic Association by conference officials to hold a championship game following the 2004 season was rejected because the ACC lacked the requisite 12 teams , and so the league 's first championship game had to wait until after Boston College 's addition , which had been delayed at the school 's request . With the addition of Boston College , the ACC consisted of 12 teams , allowing it to hold a conference championship game under NCAA rules . Before the start of the 2005 season , both Virginia Tech and Florida State were picked as pre @-@ season favorites to play in the championship game in an annual poll conducted by members of the media who cover the ACC .

 The Hokies began the 2005 regular season ranked eighth in the country , and played their first game at ACC opponent North Carolina State . It was a close @-@ fought game , but quarterback Marcus Vick threw a game @-@ winning touchdown early in the fourth quarter and the defense slowed a late NC State rally as Virginia Tech earned a 20 – 16 win . Following the close call against NC State , the Hokies blew out their next several opponents . Virginia Tech defeated Duke and Ohio by scores of 45 – 0 each . The Virginia Tech defense held Duke 's offense to just 35 total yards , an NCAA record . Following those victories , Tech hosted 15th @-@ ranked Georgia Tech , beating the Yellow Jackets by a score of 51 – 7 . Tech 's defensive success in those games was typical of the season as Virginia Tech won the first eight games of its season . 
 In their ninth game , however , third @-@ ranked Virginia Tech suffered its first loss . On a Thursday night game at home , the Hokies lost 27 – 7 to the fifth @-@ ranked Miami Hurricanes . Normally , a loss to the division @-@ rival Hurricanes would have knocked the Hokies out of contention for the ACC Championship Game , as Miami had the tie @-@ breaking head @-@ to @-@ head victory and was expected to win the remainder of its games . But because Virginia Tech won the rest of its games and the Hurricanes lost two ACC contests , ( Virginia Tech 's only ACC loss was to Miami ) the Hokies won the Coastal Division championship and qualified for the championship game over Miami . 
 = = = Florida State = = = 
 The Seminoles , like Virginia Tech , were picked as pre @-@ season favorites to win their division . Florida State opened its 2005 season against traditional rival Miami , ranked ninth in the country . In a defensive struggle , Florida State managed to upset the favored Hurricanes , 10 – 7 . Following the victory , Florida State went on a four @-@ game winning streak , defeating Syracuse , Boston College , Wake Forest , and The Citadel en route to a 5 – 0 record . 
 In the Seminoles ' sixth game of the season , they traveled to Charlottesville , Virginia to face the Virginia Cavaliers . In a hard @-@ fought game , the Seminoles lost , 26 – 21 , earning their first loss of the season . After winning their next two games , Florida State lost to NC State , Clemson , and 19th @-@ ranked Florida , the first time they had three consecutive losses since 1983 . Florida State ended the regular season with a conference record of 5 – 3 , but because one of those losses had been against a Coastal Division opponent , Florida State finished with the best Atlantic Division record and was named that division 's representative to the ACC Championship Game . 
 = = Pre @-@ game buildup = = 
 Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was predicted to be the key player for the favored Virginia Tech Hokies in pregame discussion . Vick had led the Hokies to a fifth place national ranking and an offense that earned 610 rushing yards in the final two games of the regular season . Off the field , the matchup between head coaches also was a point of interest . At the time , Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden had the most wins of any active head coach in college football , while Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was ranked third . Beamer had never defeated Bowden in a game . Before the game , Beamer was named the ACC 's 2005 Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year . 
 In addition , the game was a rematch of the 2000 BCS National Championship Game . In that game , held in New Orleans , Louisiana , Florida State defeated Virginia Tech 46 – 29 despite the performance of Hokie quarterback Michael Vick , who would later be selected as the first overall pick in the 2001 NFL Draft . Vick 's brother , Marcus , would be the Hokies ' starter at quarterback for the 2005 ACC Championship Game .

 The Virginia Tech offense was led by quarterback Marcus Vick , brother of former Tech all @-@ star Michael Vick . Coming off a season @-@ long suspension in 2004 , Vick threw for 1 @,@ 855 yards , 14 touchdowns and nine interceptions in the 2005 season leading up to the ACC Championship . Vick also ran for four touchdowns during the season and earned first @-@ team All @-@ ACC honors . Receiving Vick 's passes were a number of wide receivers and tight ends . Tight end Jeff King , a second @-@ team All @-@ ACC selection , had 20 receptions for 230 yards and five touchdowns for the season before the ACC Championship . Wide receivers Eddie Royal and David Clowney also had statistically significant seasons heading into the conference championship . Royal had 21 catches for 271 yards and two touchdowns during the regular season , while Clowney had 28 catches for 515 yards and three touchdowns . 
 Virginia Tech 's rushing offense was led by several different running backs : Mike Imoh , Branden Ore , and Cedric Humes . In 2005 , Hokie running back Cedric Humes had accumulated a career @-@ high 134 yards and two touchdowns against North Carolina in the Hokies ' final regular @-@ season game . Backup running back Branden Ore ran for 104 yards and a touchdown on 17 attempts , the second time in as many games that Humes and Ore ran for 100 yards or more in the same game . The Hokies ran 31 times in the second half and threw only two passes . A similar running game was predicted for the ACC Championship Game . Imoh , meanwhile , was limited by an ankle injury suffered during the course of the season . Heading into the conference championship game , he had rushed for 415 yards and three touchdowns .

 The day before the game , Florida State center David Castillo was named to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All @-@ America Second Team , which recognizes college football players who have achieved academic success . Writers and staffers at the magazine vote on a list of players , which is separated into " teams " based on position and performance . Castillo , who was a key component of the Seminoles ' offensive line , was also a finalist for the <unk> Trophy , informally known as the " academic Heisman " . 
 FSU quarterback Drew Weatherford recorded a statistically impressive year and was the top freshman quarterback in the nation in terms of passing yardage and passing touchdowns . Wide receivers Willie Reid , Greg Carr and Chris Davis were the primary beneficiaries of Weatherford 's passing offense during the 2005 season . Carr , a freshman , caught 27 passes for 593 yards and a conference @-@ leading nine touchdowns . Davis , a junior , caught more passes and recorded more receiving yards during the 2005 season than he had in both his previous seasons combined . Reid , the lone senior starting in the Florida State corps of wide receivers , played in a variety of positions on offense and held the Seminoles ' team record for most punt return yardage . 
 The Seminoles ' rushing offense was led by starting running backs Leon Washington and Lorenzo Booker . Booker led the team in rushing yardage , rushing attempts , rushing touchdowns , and average yards per game . Washington was the tenth @-@ ranked rusher in Florida State history in terms of rushing yardage .

 On the field , the Tech defense was captained by safety Justin Hamilton , who recorded 26 tackles and three interceptions during the 2005 season . On the defensive line , Tech 's most significant defensive players were defensive ends Chris Ellis and Darryl Tapp .

 = = Game summary = = 
 The 2005 ACC Championship Game kicked off in Jacksonville , Florida at 8 : 11 p.m. on December 3 , 2005 . The game was televised on ABC in the United States , and earned a Nielsen rating of 5 @.@ 1 , higher than that of either the Big 12 Championship Game or the Southeastern Conference Championship Game . Brent Musburger , Jack Arute , and Gary Danielson were the broadcasters for the game . At kickoff , the weather was mostly cloudy with an air temperature of 67 ° F ( 19 ° C ) degrees . Approximately 72 @,@ 429 fans were present at the game , but more than 75 @,@ 000 tickets had been sold . Virginia Tech won the pre @-@ game coin toss , but elected to defer its choice to the second half , forcing Florida State to have the ball on offense to begin the game . 
 = = = First quarter = = = 
 Florida State received the ball to begin the game , and returned the opening kickoff to its 19 @-@ yard line . In his opening drive , Seminoles quarterback Drew Weatherford completed several long passes , including a long 37 @-@ yard strike from his own 48 @-@ yard line to drive the Seminoles ' offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone . Once there , however , the Florida State offense began to struggle with the Virginia Tech defense , which had recovered somewhat from the initial shock of Weatherford 's offensive success . On the three plays that followed Weatherford 's 37 @-@ yard pass , Florida State managed only six positive yards , but this total was largely negated by a five @-@ yard false start penalty that pushed FSU 's offense backward . Facing a fourth down , Florida State coach Bobby Bowden sent in kicker Gary <unk> to attempt a 31 @-@ yard field goal . The kick was successful , and the three points gave Florida State an early 3 – 0 lead with 11 : 06 remaining in the quarter . 
 Virginia Tech 's first possession of the game began at its 15 @-@ yard line after the Florida State kickoff . Hokie quarterback Marcus Vick completed his first pass of the game , a nine @-@ yard toss to Eddie Royal , and the Hokies picked up a first down on the next play . From there , however , things began to go downhill for the Virginia Tech offense . Vick was sacked on the next play , running back Cedric Humes was tackled for a five @-@ yard loss , and the Hokies committed a five @-@ yard false start penalty . The miscues prevented Virginia Tech from gaining another first down , and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away . Florida State recovered the kick at the 50 @-@ yard line and began its second offensive possession of the game . Although Weatherford completed his first pass of the drive , both subsequent passes fell incomplete . The Seminoles punted the ball back to Virginia Tech , and the kick rolled into the end zone for a touchback . 
 The Florida State touchback allowed Vick to start at his 20 @-@ yard line for Virginia Tech 's second possession of the game . The possession began no better than the first one , as Virginia Tech committed a 10 @-@ yard holding penalty on the first play . On subsequent plays , however , the Hokie offense began to move the ball with success . Vick completed a 12 @-@ yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal , and the offense was aided by a 15 @-@ yard Florida State penalty , which gave the Hokies an automatic first down . Following the first down , Vick completed the first big Virginia Tech play of the game , throwing the ball 35 yards downfield to Justin Harper , who caught it in Florida State territory . Two more plays pushed Virginia Tech to the edge of the Florida State red zone , but a penalty and another sack prevented the Hokies from advancing the ball further . Virginia Tech was forced to send in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 45 @-@ yard field goal . The kick was good , and Virginia Tech had tied the game 3 – 3 with 1 : 00 remaining in the quarter . 
 After receiving the post @-@ field goal kickoff , the Florida State offense began another drive . After an incomplete pass and a short rush , Weatherford completed a 12 @-@ yard pass for a first down as time expired in the quarter . After 15 minutes of play , the score was tied 3 – 3 , but Drew Weatherford had begun driving Florida State offense down the field . 
 = = = Second quarter = = = 
 Having earned a first down with the final play of the first quarter , Drew Weatherford and the Florida State offense ran into difficulty as the second quarter began . An incomplete pass and a rush for no gain were followed by a false start penalty and another incomplete pass , and Florida State was forced to punt . Virginia Tech recovered the ball at its 26 @-@ yard line , but failed to capitalize on the defensive stop . Marcus Vick threw two incomplete passes and was sacked before Virginia Tech was forced into a punt . 
 Following the punt , the two teams continued to trade possessions throughout the quarter . Defense dominated , and what few big plays occurred were either neutralized by penalties or stopped by incomplete passes or rushes for no gain . In the second quarter , Virginia Tech punted the ball twice and turned the ball over on downs once . Florida State punted the ball three times and had the ball when time ran out in the quarter . Neither team managed to score , and only twice did either team manage to penetrate into the opponent 's territory . At halftime , the score remained tied , 3 – 3 . 
 = = = Third quarter = = = 
 Because Florida State had received the game 's opening kickoff , Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half . As in the first half , however , the Virginia Tech offense failed to advance the ball in any meaningful fashion . Marcus Vick threw two incompletions and running back Cedric Humes managed a short three @-@ yard dash . Forced to punt the ball away yet again , Virginia Tech set up the game 's critical play . From his 34 @-@ yard line , punter Nic Schmitt kicked the ball 49 yards to the Seminoles ' Willie Reid , who broke through the Virginia Tech special teams punt coverage for an 89 @-@ yard punt @-@ return touchdown . Reid 's return was the first touchdown of the game and the first touchdown in ACC Championship Game history . With 13 : 46 remaining in the third quarter , Florida State had taken a 10 – 3 lead . 
 After the kickoff , the Hokie offense continued the lethargy that had characterized its play in the first half , as Mike Imoh was stopped for no or little gain on consecutive plays before the Hokies were called for a five @-@ yard illegal procedure penalty . On the next play , Florida State capitalized on the momentum it had gained with Reid 's punt @-@ return touchdown as defender Pat Watkins intercepted Marcus Vick 's pass , returning it to the FSU 44 @-@ yard line . Drew Weatherford and the Seminole offense , with the game 's momentum firmly in their favor , wasted no time expanding their lead . Weatherford completed a 6 @-@ yard pass , then a 21 @-@ yard one , and was aided by a 15 @-@ yard facemask penalty against Virginia Tech . Deep inside Virginia Tech territory , the third play of the drive was a 14 @-@ yard touchdown rush by Leon Washington . The speed of the drive , after a nearly scoreless first half , frustrated the Virginia Tech defense , which committed a 15 @-@ yard personal foul after the touchdown . The scoring drive had taken just three plays and 54 seconds , and gave Florida State a 17 – 3 lead with 10 : 23 remaining in the quarter . 
 Their frustration clearly apparent , the Virginia Tech offense fared no better on their next possession . Two plays were stopped for no gain , and the only positive play — a five @-@ yard pass to Eddie Royal — was negated by a false start penalty . The Hokies were again forced to punt the ball away to Florida State , their fifth of the game . The punt allowed FSU to start at their own 46 @-@ yard line , and at first , the Seminoles were able to capitalize on that opportunity , showing some of the effectiveness that characterized their prior drive . Lorenzo Booker ran for 24 yards on two plays , but afterwards , Drew Weatherford threw two incompletions . A false start penalty backed up the Seminoles , who were forced to punt after failing to pick up the first down . The kick was an excellent one , and Florida State 's special teams were able to get downfield and stop the ball inside the Virginia Tech one @-@ yard line , again hurting the Hokie offense . 
 Though hampered by the need to work inside his own end zone , Marcus Vick completed an 11 @-@ yard pass to tight end Jeff King for a first down . The play was the sole positive gain for the VT offense , however , and Virginia Tech was forced into its sixth punt of the game . The kick was a poor one , and traveled only 28 yards before flying out of bounds . Thanks to the bad kick , Weatherford was able to start his offense inside Virginia Tech territory , and took advantage of the situation . On the first play after the punt , Weatherford completed a 41 @-@ yard throw downfield to Willie Reid , who hauled in the ball at the Virginia Tech three @-@ yard line to give the Seminoles a first and goal . After a failed quarterback sneak , however , Florida State was penalized 10 yards for holding and Weatherford was sacked for a loss of three yards on the next play . Although unable to cross the goal line for a touchdown , FSU did send in kicker Gary <unk> for his second field goal attempt of the day . The kick , a 41 @-@ yarder , was good and gave Florida State a 20 – 3 lead with 4 : 23 remaining in the third quarter . 
 Following the kickoff , Virginia Tech 's offense took the field badly needing to cut down Florida State 's lead in order to allow enough time for a fourth @-@ quarter comeback . This was not to be , however , as on the sixth play of the drive , wide receiver David Clowney fumbled the ball after catching a three @-@ yard pass from Marcus Vick . The ball was successfully recovered by Florida State 's Broderick Bunkley , thus giving Florida State another excellent chance to score from deep inside Virginia Tech territory . On the second play after the fumble , quarterback Drew Weatherford connected on a 22 @-@ yard strike to Greg Carr to drive inside the Virginia Tech 10 @-@ yard line . A five @-@ yard facemask penalty against Virginia Tech only added to the Hokies ' defensive problems , and two plays later , Weatherford capped the drive with a six @-@ yard touchdown pass to Chris Davis , expanding the Florida State lead to 27 – 3 with just 18 seconds remaining in the quarter . 
 At the end of the third quarter , any hope of victory was seemingly out of reach for Virginia Tech . Three quick plays after the kickoff resulted in a first down before time ran out , but at the end of the third quarter , Florida State still had a 27 – 3 lead . 
 = = = Fourth quarter = = = 
 Virginia Tech began the fourth quarter in possession of the ball and with a first down , but trailing by 24 points and virtually out of the game . The first two plays of the fourth quarter were similar to what the Tech offense had shown all game : an incomplete pass and a rush for no yards . On the third play , however , Florida State was penalized 15 yards for having too many players on the field , and Virginia Tech was awarded an automatic first down . The penalty allowed the Hokie offense to continue its drive , and Marcus Vick scrambled for 16 yards on the next play , then threw a 28 @-@ yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan , who broke free for a touchdown . The score was Virginia Tech 's first touchdown of the game , and came with 13 : 03 remaining in the game . Following the touchdown , the Hokies attempted a two @-@ point conversion , but Vick 's pass fell short and the conversion attempt failed . The score cut the Florida State lead to 27 – 9 , but this was still a large margin for the amount of time remaining in the game . 
 Florida State received the post @-@ score kickoff merely needing to run down the clock to secure its lead and the win . Two complete passes set up a third @-@ and @-@ two for Drew Weatherford , but his third @-@ down pass fell short , stopping the clock and forcing a Florida State punt . Only a minute and a half had run off the clock , and Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22 @-@ yard line . On the second play after the punt , Florida State committed a pass interference penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15 automatic yards and a first down . As in the previous drive , the penalty kick @-@ started the Virginia Tech offense . On the next play , Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50 @-@ yard pass — the longest offensive play of the game — that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine @-@ yard line . After that , a Florida State holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first @-@ and @-@ goal from inside the FSU five @-@ yard line . Marcus Vick scrambled four yards for the touchdown , and what had been a 24 @-@ point Seminole lead was now cut to 11 points . The drive had taken just 55 seconds off the clock , and it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a chance to make it a close game . As before , Virginia Tech attempted a two @-@ point conversion , and as before , it failed . With 10 : 50 remaining in the game , the score was now Florida State 27 , Virginia Tech 15 . 
 Florida State began work at its 30 @-@ yard line , again needing to just run down the clock to ensure victory . As before , however , Drew Weatherford took to the air , throwing a two @-@ yard pass . Two rushing plays followed , but were stopped for little gain . Florida State again went three @-@ and @-@ out and had to punt . Two and a half minutes had been run off the clock , and Virginia Tech took over at its own 30 @-@ yard line after a seven @-@ yard kick return . Unlike the two previous drives , however , Virginia Tech had almost no success on offense . A 10 @-@ yard holding penalty pushed the Hokie offense back to start the drive , and quarterback Marcus Vick was sacked for a loss to finish off the Tech possession . VT was forced to punt the ball back to Florida State , which took over at its 43 @-@ yard line with 6 : 21 remaining . 
 By this point in the game , Florida State was fully committed to running down the clock and executed three straight rushing plays to keep the time running out . Virginia Tech was forced to use two of its timeouts to stop the clock , but was eventually successful in forcing a Seminole punt . The kick rolled inside the Virginia Tech 10 @-@ yard line before being downed , pinning the Hokies deep in their territory . The first play of Tech 's drive was almost a disaster for Virginia Tech , as Marcus Vick fumbled the ball while attempting to avoid a sack . Fortunately for the Hokies , the ball was leapt on by Tech 's Duane Brown and the drive stayed alive . Virginia Tech moved the ball downfield through the air with difficulty . Due to the limited time remaining , Virginia Tech was forced to rely mainly on passing plays , which stopped the clock when incomplete or were completed for a first down . A 14 @-@ yard pass to Josh Morgan and a 10 @-@ yard throw to Cedric Humes moved the Hokies to their 47 @-@ yard line . Vick then completed a 19 @-@ yard pass to Jeff King and Florida State committed a 15 @-@ yard roughing the passer penalty on Marcus Vick , which was tacked onto the end of the play . After the penalty , Virginia Tech 's offense was deep in Florida State territory , and two plays later , Marcus Vick ran into the end zone on a one @-@ yard quarterback scramble . Rather than attempt another two @-@ point conversion , the Hokies kicked the extra point , and with 1 : 44 remaining , Virginia Tech had closed the gap to 27 – 22 . 
 In a situation with more time , Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and hoped for a defensive stop to give the offense a chance for a game @-@ winning drive . With less than two minutes remaining , however , and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts , the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick . A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense . Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball , and kicked it forwards , bouncing the ball high into the air to create a jump ball situation . Virginia Tech 's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball , but because the kick had only traveled nine yards before the recovery , the ball was awarded to Florida State . NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10 yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball , and Pace 's kick had not traveled the requisite distance . 
 Having recovered the ball , and with Virginia Tech having no remaining timeouts and no way to stop the clock , Florida State was able to run out the remaining time in the game and secure a 27 – 22 victory . Towards the end of the game , players on each team acted with hostility towards each other , and several received personal foul penalties . The penalties had no effect on the final outcome of the game , and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl . 
 = = Final statistics = = 
 Thanks to his performance in leading Florida State to the win , FSU quarterback Drew Weatherford was named the game 's Most Valuable Player . Weatherford finished the game having completed 21 of his 35 passes for 225 yards and one touchdown . Weatherford would eventually finish the season with 3 @,@ 180 passing yards , the most ever recorded by a freshman quarterback in the ACC . On the opposite side of the ball , Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick finished the game 26 for 52 with 335 yards , one interception , and one touchdown . Although Vick was slightly better statistically than Weatherford and the Hokies were more statistically successful on offense thanks to Vick , the Most Valuable Player award is not usually given to a player on the losing team . 
 Virginia Tech turned the ball over twice — once on a fumble and once on an interception . The two turnovers resulted in two touchdowns for Florida State , and the resulting 14 points were greater than Florida State 's margin of victory . The Seminoles did not turn the ball over during the game . Both teams were highly penalized during the game . Virginia Tech finished with 17 penalties for 143 yards , while Florida State was penalized 12 times for 114 yards . The penalties affected each team 's ability to convert third downs , as Virginia Tech was only able to convert 9 of 20 third @-@ down attempts , while Florida State was successful on just 3 of its 13 attempts . Despite trailing for much of the game and running a pass @-@ heavy offense , Virginia Tech dominated the game 's time of possession , controlling the ball for over 35 of the game 's 60 minutes .

 Florida State ( 8 – 4 ) earned a BCS berth despite a record inferior to the other seven BCS teams .

 Virginia Tech accepted a bid to the 2006 Gator Bowl , which was also played in Jacksonville , albeit a month later than the ACC Championship Game . The Gator Bowl Committee selected the Hokies over Miami due to Virginia Tech 's reputation for having a large fan base that traveled well . Virginia Tech 's selection bumped Miami to the 2005 Peach Bowl , while the Virginia Cavaliers were selected for the Music City Bowl and the Clemson Tigers earned a bid to the Champs Sports Bowl . 
 In the off @-@ season following the ACC Championship Game and Florida State 's selection by the Orange Bowl , the Orange Bowl committee announced it would be entering into an exclusive contract with the ACC to grant the winner of the ACC Championship Game an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl unless it was ranked high enough in the Bowl Championship Series standings to play in the BCS National Championship Game .

 Following the ACC Championship Game , Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick stormed off the field , refusing to talk to reporters . Vick , who picked up a 15 @-@ yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty late in the game , also earned several unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the 2006 Gator Bowl , where post @-@ game replays revealed that he purposefully stomped on the leg of Louisville Cardinals ' defensive end Elvis Dumervil . Vick claimed he apologized to Dumervil after the game , but Dumervil stated that no apology had been made . In the wake of the incident , Virginia Tech officials announced that they would be conducting a review of Vick 's conduct on and off the field . 
 On January 6 , 2006 , just a few days after that game , Virginia Tech officials dismissed Vick from the Virginia Tech football team , citing a December 17 traffic stop in which Vick was cited for speeding and driving with a revoked or suspended license . Vick had hidden the information from the team and the infraction was not discovered until January . The traffic stop , an earlier suspension from the team , and his unsportsmanlike conduct during the 2005 ACC Championship Game and 2006 Gator Bowl were used as grounds for his dismissal . 
 = Ricberht of East Anglia = 
 Ricberht ( Old English : <unk> ) , may have briefly ruled East Anglia , a small independent Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdom which today includes the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk . Little is known of his life or his reign . 
 According to Bede 's Ecclesiastical History of the English People , Ricberht murdered Eorpwald of East Anglia in about 627 , shortly after Eorpwald succeeded his father Rædwald as king and had then been baptised as a Christian . Following Eorpwald 's death , Ricberht may have become king , a possibility that is not mentioned by Bede or any contemporary commentator . East Anglia then reverted to paganism for three years , before Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded jointly as kings of East Anglia and ended the kingdom 's brief period of apostasy . 
 = = Background = = 
 The earliest East Anglian kings were pagans . They belonged to the Wuffingas dynasty , named after Wuffa , whose ancestors originated from northern Europe and whose descendants ruled the East Angles in an almost unbroken line until after the reign of Ælfwald in the middle of the 8th century . 
 When East Anglia was first mentioned by Bede in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People , it was a powerful kingdom ruled by Rædwald ( died about 624 ) . According to Bede , Rædwald was recognised as exercising dominance or imperium over the southern Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdoms , a position that was assured when he gave his loyalty and support to Edwin of Northumbria ( who was at that time a fugitive at the East Anglian court ) and when together they defeated Æthelfrith of Northumbria on the banks of the River Idle , a tributary of the Trent . Rædwald was converted to Christianity in Kent at the invitation of King Æthelberht , but under the influence of his pagan wife , his church contained both a Christian and a pagan altar . 
 Upon his death in around 624 , Rædwald was succeeded by his surviving son Eorpwald , who was then converted to the Christian faith shortly after becoming king . According to the historian N. J. Higham , Edwin of Northumbria was able to persuade Eorpwald into accepting an " alien cult " , whose authority rested outside East Anglia , with Paulinus of York , Edwin 's bishop . Eorpwald may have been sponsored by King Edwin at his baptism , which would have resulted in Edwin being acknowledged as Eorpwald 's lord . The East Angles may also have been baptised as a people , which would have undermined Eorpwald 's authority as king and acted against the authority of any long @-@ established pagan cults . 
 = = The assassination of Eorpwald = = 
 Soon after his conversion , Eorpwald was killed by Ricberht , possibly as the result of a pagan reaction to the East Anglian conversion . Nothing about Ricberht 's ancestry or background is known , although his name can be taken to imply that he was a member of the East Anglian elite and was perhaps related to Eorpwald . The single source for Ricberht , Bede 's Ecclesiastical History , states that " Eorpwald , not long after he had embraced the Christian faith , was slain by one Ricberht , a pagan ; " ( " <unk> <unk> non <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , tempore <unk> est a <unk> <unk> nomine <unk> ; " ) . It is not known where Eorpwald 's murder occurred , or of any other details surrounding his death . 
 = = Rule = = 
 Historians generally maintain that Ricberht , if he became king at all , succeeded Eorpwald and ruled for three years . Bede does not mention him again , only noting that " the province was in error for three years " ( " et <unk> tribus <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> est " ) , prior to the accession of Eorpwald 's half @-@ brother ( or brother ) Sigeberht and his kinsman Ecgric . 
 Scholars have been unable to determine the exact regnal dates of several kings of this period , including that of Ricberht , with any certainty . Higham surmises that Ricberht 's ability to rule for three years , at a time when Edwin was overlord among the Anglo @-@ Saxons , implies that Ricberht was supported by the East Angles in overthrowing Eorpwald , whom they regarded as " overly compliant " towards the Northumbrian king . 
 It has been speculated by Michael Wood and other historians that Ricberht may have been interred in the Sutton Hoo ship @-@ burial near the Wuffingas centre of authority at Rendlesham , but most experts consider Rædwald to be a more likely candidate . Martin Carver has used the evidence of what he identifies as iconic pagan practices at Sutton Hoo to theorise that the ship burial represents one example of pagan defiance " provoked by the perceived menace of a predatory Christian mission " . 
 = = Successors = = 
 In about 630 , Christianity was permanently re @-@ established in East Anglia when Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded to rule jointly . Ecgric , who may have been a sub @-@ king until the abdication of Sigeberht in around 634 , seems to have remained a pagan . There is no evidence that Ecgric adopted or promoted Christianity : Bede wrote nothing to imply that he was a Christian , in contrast to his praise of the devout Sigeberht , the first English king to receive a Christian baptism and education before his succession . 
 = Philadelphia Flyers – Ottawa Senators brawl = 
 The Flyers – Senators brawl was a National Hockey League ( NHL ) regular season game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Ottawa Senators that resulted in a league record for penalty minutes . The game was played on March 5 , 2004 , at the Wachovia Center , the home arena of the Flyers . Philadelphia won the game by the score 5 – 3 . In all , 419 minutes were assessed , passing the previous NHL record of 406 . The 213 minutes assessed against Philadelphia was also a record , as was the number of penalty minutes in the third period . 
 The events were precipitated by an incident in the previous meeting between the two teams , when Ottawa 's Martin Havlat had swung his stick at Mark Recchi 's head . Just under two minutes before the end of the game , enforcers Donald Brashear of the Flyers and Rob Ray of the Senators engaged in a fight . As they skated off to the penalty box , Brashear became involved in another scrap , and the rest of the players on the ice for each team , including goaltenders Robert Esche and Patrick Lalime began to fight . On both of the next two face @-@ offs to restart the game , further fights occurred . The first of these angered the Flyers management , who believed that the fights were deliberately unbalanced against their players . 
 On the third restart after the initial fight , the crowd booed when a fight did not immediately ensue , but in less than 30 seconds , two more fights had broken out . The final fight occurred directly after the fourth face @-@ off , involving Jason Spezza and Patrick Sharp . Spezza and Brashear were assessed for the most penalty minutes in the game , receiving 35 and 34 , respectively . At the start of the 2005 – 06 season , the NHL introduced a rule that punished anyone instigating a fight in the final five minutes of a game with a one @-@ game suspension , in order to prevent similar incidents occurring in the future . 
 = = Background = = 
 In each of the previous two seasons , the Philadelphia Flyers and the Ottawa Senators had met in the Stanley Cup playoffs , and on each occasion the Senators had eliminated the Flyers . The Flyers had not beaten the Senators in their previous five contests , going 0 – 3 – 2 . 
 When the two sides met in late @-@ February , a week before the brawl game , during the third period , Flyers winger Mark Recchi was following Martin Havlat of the Senators when he crossed into the Philadelphia defensive zone . As this happened , Recchi hooked Havlat , causing both of the players to collide and fall into the boards . When Havlat got up from the ice , angered by Recchi 's hook , he took his stick above him and slashed Recchi , hitting him in the face . 
 Havlat was given a five @-@ minute major penalty for attempting to injure Recchi , along with a game misconduct penalty . He was later given a two @-@ game suspension by the NHL due to the incident . He was forced to give up US $ 36 @,@ 585 @.@ 36 of his salary as he had already been suspended for kicking Eric Cairns of the New York Islanders earlier in the season . 
 Revenge was mentioned after the game by Flyers Head Coach Ken Hitchcock . During a post @-@ game interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) , he commented that " someday , someone 's going to make him eat his lunch . This is something , in my opinion , that the players should take care of . " Recchi also mentioned revenge , not specifically from the Flyers , during an interview with the CBC . " It doesn 't surprise me coming from this guy . He 's that type of player . He 's done it before . It might not come from our team . But he better protect himself , " said Recchi . 
 = = Game summary = = 
 Despite having what Rob <unk> of the Associated Press described as " bad blood " between them , the first period of the game passed without serious incident . Chris Neil opened the scoring for Ottawa just over four minutes into the period , but the Flyers then took the lead when Claude Lapointe and Mark Recchi scored 30 seconds apart . Danny Markov added a third for Philadelphia to give them a two @-@ goal lead . The only penalty assessed in the period was for holding against Philadelphia 's Tony <unk> . 
 Both teams scored a goal each in the second and third periods . In the second period , an early tripping penalty against Ottawa 's Mike Fisher put the Flyers on the power play , during which Kim Johnsson extended Philadelphia 's lead to 4 – 1 . Ottawa received another penalty less than a minute later , which sent Todd Simpson to the penalty box for holding . A Flyers penalty against Radovan Somik for slashing Martin Havlat resulted in a power play goal for the Senators ' Zdeno Chara , closing the score to a two @-@ goal gap once again . Fisher subsequently received his second penalty of the game , for high @-@ sticking . 
 The third period began with Alexei <unk> notching the Flyers ' fifth goal of the game to make it 5 – 2 . Shortly thereafter , the game started to become more heated ; <unk> and Daniel Alfredsson were assessed coincidental minors for roughing nine minutes into the period , and three minutes later Bryan Smolinski and Mark Greig were similarly penalized . Simpson returned to the box soon after , for slashing Michal <unk> , but Philadelphia 's power play when cut short when they received a penalty for having too many men on the ice . 
 With 1 : 45 left in the third period , Flyers ' enforcer Donald Brashear hit Rob Ray , an enforcer for the Senators , from behind , instigating a fight between the pair . When he was asked after the game why he started the fight , Brashear replied with his own question : " Did you see the last game ? " His reply was interpreted as being a reference to Havlat 's slashing penalty against Recchi . Brashear was generally considered to win the fight , with Tim <unk> of The Philadelphia Inquirer claiming that Brashear " destroyed Rob Ray . " The fight left Ray bloodied , and as Brashear was being escorted off the ice by the linesman , he exchanged blows with both Brian Pothier and Todd Simpson . Philadelphia 's Patrick Sharp attempted to restrain Simpson , who then pushed Sharp to the ice and started throwing punches at him . Markov intervened , and fought Simpson . At the same time , Branko <unk> and Shaun Van Allen had paired off for a fight , and Ottawa 's goaltender , Patrick Lalime , skated the length of the ice to fight fellow goaltender Robert Esche ; both received penalties for leaving their crease as well as fighting majors . 
 The game restarted with two new goaltenders and the Senators on the power play , but within three seconds , the fighting started again — Ottawa 's Chris Neil poked Radovan Somik with his stick , and the pair started scrapping . At the same time , Zdeno Chara started a fight with the Flyers ' Mattias <unk> , for which the former received an instigator penalty . Both fights angered Philadelphia Head Coach Ken Hitchcock , who claimed that , " Their tough guy [ Rob Ray ] got beat up and then their next two lines fought guys who don 't fight . " Flyer General Manager Bob Clarke was also critical , saying , " I understand Rob Ray fighting Donald Brashear . That 's okay . [ ... ] But don 't go after guys who don 't know how to defend themselves like Somik and <unk> . " As Chara had been ejected from the game , his penalty was served by Martin Havlat , who had been placed there to protect him from any possible attempts at retribution . Chara 's penalty meant that at the next restart , the teams were back to even strength , with four players each . Immediately after the ensuing face @-@ off , Michal <unk> and Mike Fisher took part in the seventh fight of the game . 
 There were no fights straight after the next restart , which resulted in booing from the crowd . Within 24 seconds of that restart , the crowd had their way ; Mark Recchi hit Wade Redden , who immediately launched himself into a fight with John LeClair . While those two fought , Recchi and Bryan Smolinski engaged in a second fight in the middle of the rink . LeClair received an additional penalty for holding , placing the Senators on the power play . At the next face @-@ off , a fight once again broke out straight away , between Jason Spezza and Patrick Sharp . Spezza received a fighting major , a misconduct and double game misconduct , totalling 35 penalty minutes , the most of any player in the game . 
 The rest of the game proceeded without any fights ; the Flyers only had four players left on their bench , while the Senators had two . The Senators tallied the final goal of the game with 13 seconds remaining , with Peter Bondra scoring on the power play to make the final score 5 – 3 . At the end of the game , it took the officials 90 minutes to allocate all the penalties that had been given to the two sides . The two teams combined for 419 penalty minutes , an NHL record , breaking the previous total of 406 in a 1981 game between the Boston Bruins and the Minnesota North Stars . Philadelphia 's 213 penalty minutes was also a new League record , as were the 409 minutes assessed in the third period . Interviewed after the game , Mike Fisher of Ottawa said that the Senators " knew [ they ] had to fight back . [ They ] had to stand up for each other . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The media drew comparisons between the game and the " Broad Street Bullies " era of the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1970s , when they played very aggressive hockey with numerous fights . At the conclusion of the game Bobby Clarke , Philadelphia 's general manager , attempted to enter the Senators ' dressing room to confront their head coach , Jacques Martin , but was restrained by a colleague . Clarke said that he would not have hit Martin , but that he had wanted to challenge Martin about the unbalanced fight pairings . Clarke subsequently lodged a complaint with league supervisor Claude <unk> . The only player to receive a fine or suspension as a result of the game was Danny Markov , who got a statutory one @-@ game ban for collecting his third game misconduct of the season . 
 Philadelphia @-@ based Comcast SportsNet ( CSN ) , which had aired the game live , described it as an " instant classic , " replayed the game the following Wednesday ( March 10 ) . The replayed received a Nielsen rating of 1 @.@ 0 , a higher figure than most telecasts involving the Philadelphia Flyers . League officials from the NHL were unhappy with the replay being shown , as they perceived the game to tarnish the League 's image , and they requested that CSN not replay the game again . 
 The Flyers and the Senators met once more during the season , and despite some claims from Bobby Clarke that Philadelphia would seek further revenge , there were only six minor penalties assessed in the match , which the Senators won 3 – 1 . Ottawa defenceman Zdeno Chara explained that " both teams were really focusing on the two points . We weren 't going to risk that by fighting . " Both teams qualified for the 2004 playoffs ; Ottawa were eliminated in the first @-@ round by the Toronto Maple Leafs , while Philadelphia defeated the New Jersey Devils and Maple Leafs to reach the Eastern Conference Finals , but were then beaten by the eventual Stanley Cup champions , the Tampa Bay Lightning . 
 The brawl , along with an incident between the Vancouver Canucks ' Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore of the Colorado Avalanche , ( in which Bertuzzi hit Moore from behind , breaking his neck , in retaliation for a hit by Moore on one of Bertuzzi 's team @-@ mates a month earlier ) , brought the issue of violence in ice hockey into focus . Particular attention was given to retaliation ; when Brashear was interviewed on the subject of the Bertuzzi incident , he defended such on @-@ ice revenge , and suggested that Bertuzzi should not receive a suspension , because " all they have to do is go after him when he comes back . " That mindset echoed the comments made by Ken Hitchcock and Mark Recchi about Martin Havlat , and Sam <unk> of the Philadelphia Daily News suggested that it was prevailing opinion amongst all the players in the League . He suggested that rather than wanting stricter penalties to clamp down on dangerous play , ( which he advocated ) , the players believed that removing the penalty for instigating a fight , and allowing players to therefore get their retribution by that means , would have the same effect . Mike <unk> of The Dallas Morning News also believed that the league should be stricter in handing out fines and suspensions , suggesting that Hitchcock should possibly have been penalised for his revenge comments , and that if Havlat had received a lengthier ban for his actions , the brawl between the Flyers and Senators may not have happened . 
 The 2004 – 05 NHL season was cancelled because of a labour dispute , but upon the League 's return for the 2005 – 06 season , a rule was added which meant that any player being assessed for an instigator penalty in the last five minutes of a match would receive an automatic one @-@ game ban , and the player 's head coach could also be fined . This was designed to avoid situations such as happened in game between the Flyers and Senators , and addressed the fact that physical play tended to increase towards the end of a game , particularly when the result was not in question .

 Gather Together in My Name ( 1974 ) is a memoir by American writer and poet Maya Angelou . It is the second book in Angelou 's series of seven autobiographies . The book begins immediately following the events described in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , and follows Angelou , called Rita , from the ages of 17 to 19 . Written three years after Caged Bird , the book " depicts a single mother 's slide down the social ladder into poverty and crime . " The title of the book is taken from the Bible , but it also conveys how one black female lived in the white @-@ dominated society of the U.S. following the Second World War . 
 Angelou expands upon many themes that she started discussing in her first autobiography , including motherhood and family , racism , identity , education and literacy . Rita becomes closer to her mother in this book , and goes through a variety of jobs and relationships as she tries to provide for her young son and find her place in the world . Angelou continues to discuss racism in Gather Together , but moves from speaking for all Black women to describing how one young woman dealt with it . The book exhibits the narcissism of young people , but describes how Rita discovers her identity . Like many of Angelou 's autobiographies , Gather Together is concerned with Angelou 's on @-@ going self @-@ education . 
 Gather Together was not as critically acclaimed as Angelou 's first autobiography , but received mostly positive reviews and was recognized as being better written than its predecessor . The book 's structure , consisting of a series of episodes tied together by theme and content , parallels the chaos of adolescence , which some critics feel makes it an unsatisfactory sequel to Caged Bird . Rita 's many physical movements throughout the book , which affects the book 's organization and quality , has caused at least one critic to call it a travel narrative . 
 = = Background = = 
 Gather Together in My Name , published in 1974 , is Maya Angelou 's second book in her series of seven autobiographies . Written three years after her first autobiography , I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , the book " depicts a single mother 's slide down the social ladder into poverty and crime " . In 1971 , Angelou published her first volume of poetry , Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie ( 1971 ) , which became a bestseller and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize . It was Angelou 's early practice to alternate a prose volume with a poetry volume . In 1993 , Angelou recited her poem " On the Pulse of Morning " at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton , becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy 's inauguration in 1961 . Through the writing of this autobiography and her life stories in all of her books , Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women . According to scholar Joanne Braxton , it made her " without a doubt ... America 's most visible black woman autobiographer " . 
 = = = Title = = = 
 The title of Gather Together is inspired by Matthew 18 : 19 @-@ 20 : " Again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven . For where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them " ( King James version ) . While Angelou acknowledged the title 's biblical origin , she also stated that the title counteracted the tendency of many adults to lie to their children about their pasts . Scholar Sondra O 'Neale states that the title is " a New Testament injunction for the traveling soul to pray and commune while waiting patiently for deliverance " . 
 Critic Hilton Als believes that the title of this book may have an additional significance . A prevailing theme in Gather Together is how one Black female was able to survive in the wider context of post @-@ war America , but it also speaks for all Black women , and how they came to survive in a white @-@ dominated society . Critic Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees : " The incidents in the book appear merely gathered together in the name of Maya Angelou " . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The book opens in the years following World War II . Angelou , still known as " Marguerite , " or " Rita , " has just given birth to her son Clyde , and is living with her mother and stepfather in San Francisco . The book follows Marguerite from the ages of 17 to 19 , through a series of relationships , occupations , and cities as she attempts to raise her son and to find her place in the world . It continues exploring the themes of Angelou 's isolation and loneliness begun in her first volume , and the ways she overcomes racism , sexism , and her continued victimization . 
 Rita goes from job to job and from relationship to relationship , hoping that " my charming prince was going to appear out of the blue " . " My fantasies were little different than any other girl of my age " , Angelou wrote . " He would come . He would . Just walk into my life , see me and fall everlastingly in love ... I looked forward to a husband who would love me <unk> , spiritually , and on rare ( but beautiful ) occasions , physically " . 
 Some humorous and potentially dangerous events occur throughout the book while Rita tries to care for herself and her son . In San Diego , Rita becomes an absentee manager for two lesbian prostitutes . When threatened with incarceration and with losing her son for her illegal activities , she and Clyde escape to her grandmother 's home in Stamps , Arkansas . Her grandmother sends them to San Francisco for their safety and protection after physically punishing Rita for confronting two white women in a department store . This event demonstrates their different and irreconcilable attitudes about race , paralleling events in Angelou 's first book . Back with her mother in San Francisco , Rita attempts to enlist in the Army , only to be rejected during the height of the Red Scare because she had attended the California Labor School as a young teenager . 
 Another event of note described in the book was , in spite of " the strangest audition " , her short stint dancing and studying dance with her partner , R. L. Poole , who became her lover until he reunited with his previous partner , ending Rita 's show business career for the time being . 
 A turning point in the book occurs when Rita falls in love with the Episcopalian preacher L. D. <unk> , who seduces Rita and introduces her to prostitution . Her mother 's hospitalization and death of her brother Bailey 's wife drives Rita to her mother 's home . She leaves her young son with a caretaker , Big Mary , but when she returns for him , she finds that Big Mary had disappeared with Clyde . She tries to elicit help from <unk> , who puts her in her place when she finds him at his home and requests that he help her find her son . She finally realizes that he had been taking advantage of her , but is able to trace Big Mary and Clyde to Bakersfield , California , and has an emotional reunion with her son . She writes , " In the plowed farmyard near Bakersfield , I began to understand that uniqueness of the person . He was three and I was nineteen , and never again would I think of him as a beautiful appendage of myself " . 
 The end of the book finds Rita defeated by life : " For the first time I sat down defenseless to await life 's next assault " . The book ends with an encounter with a drug addict who cared enough for her to show her the effects of his drug habit , which <unk> her to reject drug addiction and to make something of her life for her and her son . 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = Motherhood and family = = = 
 Beginning in Gather Together , motherhood and family issues are important themes throughout Angelou 's autobiographies . The book describes the change and the importance of Rita 's relationship with her own mother , the woman who had abandoned her and her brother as children , demonstrated by Rita 's return to her mother at the end of the book , " after she realizes how close to the edge she has come , as a woman and as a mother " . Vivian Baxter cares for Rita 's young son as Rita attempts to make a living . Critic Mary Jane Lupton states that " one gets a strong sense throughout Gather Together of [ Rita 's ] dependence on her mother " . Critic Lyman B. Hagen remarks that Angelou 's relationship with her mother becomes more important in Gather Together , and that Vivian is now more influential in the development of Angelou 's attitudes . Lupton calls Clyde 's kidnapping a " powerful sequence of mother @-@ loss " and connects it to the kidnapping of Clyde 's son in the 1980s . Angelou has compared the production of this book to giving birth , an apt metaphor given the birth of her son at the end of Caged Bird . Like many authors , Angelou views the creative writing process and its results as her children . 
 = = = Race and racism = = = 
 Angelou 's goal , beginning with her first autobiography , was to " tell the truth about the lives of black women " , but her goal evolved , in her later volumes , to document the ups and downs of her own life . Angelou 's autobiographies have the same structure : they give a historical overview of the places she was living in at the time , how she coped within the context of a larger white society , and the ways that her story played out within that context . Critic Selwyn Cudjoe stated that in Gather Together , Angelou is still concerned with the questions of what it means to be a Black female in the US , but focuses upon herself at a certain point in history , in the years immediately following World War II . The book begins with a prologue describing the confusion and disillusionment of the African @-@ American community during that time , which matched the alienated and fragmented nature of the main character 's life . According to McPherson , African Americans were promised a new racial order that did not materialize . 
 Halfway through Gather Together , an incident occurs that demonstrates the different ways in which Rita and her grandmother handle racism . Rita , when she is insulted by white clerk during a visit to Stamps , reacts with defiance , but when Momma hears about the confrontation , she slaps Rita and sends her back to California . Rita feels that her personhood was being violated , but the practical Momma knows that her granddaughter 's behavior was dangerous . Rita 's grandmother is no longer an important influence on her life , and Angelou demonstrates that she had to move on in the fight against racism . 
 Angelou 's autobiographies , including this volume , have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches in teacher education . Dr. Jocelyn A. Glazier , a professor at George Washington University , has used Caged Bird and Gather Together to train teachers how to discuss race in their classrooms . According to Glazier , Angelou 's use of understatement , self @-@ mockery , humor , and irony , readers of Gather Together and the rest of Angelou 's autobiographies cause readers to wonder what she left out and unsure about how to respond to the events Angelou describes . Angelou 's depictions of her experiences of racism force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status . Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African American autobiography and on her literary techniques , readers react to her storytelling with " surprise , particularly when [ they ] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography " . 
 = = = Identity = = = 
 Gather Together retains the freshness of Caged Bird , but has a self @-@ consciousness absent from the first volume . Author Hilton Als states that Angelou " replaces the language of social history with the language of therapy " . The book exhibits the narcissism and self @-@ involvement of young adults . It is Rita who is the focus , and all other characters are secondary , and they are often presented " with the deft superficiality of a stage description " who pay the price for Rita 's self @-@ involvement . Much of Angelou 's writing in this volume , as Als states , is " reactive , not reflective " . Angelou chooses to demonstrate Rita 's narcissism in Gather Together by dropping the conventional forms of autobiography , which has a beginning , middle , and end . For example , there is no central experience in her second volume , as there is in Caged Bird with Angelou 's account of her rape at the age of eight . Lupton believes that this central experience is relocated " to some luminous place in a volume yet to be " . 
 Gather Together , like much of African @-@ American literature , depicts Rita 's search for self @-@ discovery , identity , and dignity in the difficult environment of racism , and how she , like other African Americans , were able to rise above it . Rita 's search is expressed both outwardly , through her material needs , and inwardly , through love and family relationships . In Caged Bird , despite trauma and parental rejection , Rita 's world is relatively secure , but the adolescent young woman in Gather Together experiences the dissolution of her relationships many times . The loneliness that ensues for her is " a loneliness that becomes , at times , suicidal and contributes to her unanchored self " . Rita is unsure of who she is or what she would become , so she tries several roles in a restless and frustrated way , as adolescents often do during this period of their lives . Her experimentation was part of her self @-@ education that would successfully bring her into maturity and adulthood . Lupton agrees , stating that Rita survived through trial and error while defining herself as a Black woman . Angelou recognizes that the mistakes she depicts are part of " the <unk> of youth and to be forgiven as such " , but young Rita insists that she take responsibility for herself and her child . 
 Feminist scholar Maria Lauret states that the formation of female cultural identity is woven into Angelou 's narrative , setting her up as " a role model for Black women " . Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou reconstructs the Black woman 's image throughout her autobiographies , and that Angelou uses her many roles , incarnations , and identities in her books to " signify multiple layers of oppression and personal history " . Angelou begins this technique in her first book , and continues it in Gather Together , especially her demonstration of the " racist habit " of renaming African Americans . Lauret sees Angelou 's themes of the individual 's strength and ability to overcome throughout Angelou 's autobiographies as well . Cudjoe states that Angelou is still concerned with what it means to be Black and female in America , but she now describes " a particular type of Black woman at a specific moment in history and subjected to certain social forces which assault the Black woman with unusual intensity " . When Angelou was concerned about what her readers would think when she disclosed that she had been a prostitute , her husband Paul Du Feu encouraged her to be honest and " tell the truth as a writer " . Cudjoe recognizes Angelou 's reluctance to disclose these events in the text , stating that although they are important in her social development , Angelou does not seem " particularly proud of her activity during those ' few tense years ' " . Angelou has stated that she wrote the book , in spite of potentially harming the reputation she gained after writing Caged Bird , because she wanted to show how she was able to survive in a world where " every door is not only locked , but there are no doorknobs ... The children need to know you can stumble and fumble and fall , see where you are and get up , forgive yourself , and go on about the business of living your life " . 
 = = = Education and literacy = = = 
 All of Angelou 's autobiographies , especially this volume and its predecessor , is " very much concerned with what [ Angelou ] knew and how she learned it " . Lupton compares Angelou 's informal education described in this book with the education of other Black writers of the 20th century . Like writers such as Claude McKay , Langston Hughes , and James Baldwin , Angelou did not earn a college degree and depended upon the " direct instruction of African American cultural forms " . She did not feel that her education ended at high school , however . As Hagen points out , since Angelou was encouraged to appreciate literature as a young child , she continues to read , exposing herself to a wide variety of authors , ranging from Countee Cullen 's poetry to Leo Tolstoy and other Russian authors . She states , during her stint as a madame , " when my life hinged melodramatically on intrigue and deceit , I discovered the Russian writers " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Gather Together in My Name was not as critically acclaimed as Angelou 's first autobiography , but received mostly positive reviews and was recognized as better written . Atlantic Monthly 's reviewer said that the book was " excellently written " . and Choice Magazine called Angelou a " fine story teller " . Cudjoe calls the book " neither politically nor linguistically innocent " . Although Cudjoe finds Gather Together a weaker autobiography compared to Caged Bird , he states that Angelou 's use of language is " the work 's saving grace " , and that it contains " a much more consistent and sustained flow of eloquent and honey @-@ dipped writing " . 
 Lupton feels that the tight structure of Caged Bird seems to crumble in Gather Together . Angelou 's " childhood experiences were replaced by episodes that a number of critics consider disjointed or bizarre " ; Lupton 's explanation was that Angelou 's later works consist of episodes , or fragments , that are " reflections of the kind of chaos found in actual living " . Cudjoe thought this convention is what weakened the book 's structure , stating that the events described prevented it from achieving a " complex level of significance " . Lupton states , " In altering the narrative structure , Angelou shifts the emphasis from herself as an isolated consciousness to herself as a Black woman participating in diverse experiences among a diverse class of peoples " . There are similarities in the structure of both books , however . Like Caged Bird , Gather Together consists of a series of interrelated episodes , and both books also start with a poetic preface . 
 Cudjoe has noted that Gather Together lacks the " intense solidity and moral center " found in Caged Bird , and that the strong ethics of the Black community in the rural South is replaced by the alienation and fragmentation of urban life in the first half of the twentieth century . The world that Angelou introduces her readers to in Gather Together leaves her protagonist without a sense of purpose , and as Cudjoe states , " to the brink of destruction in order to realize herself " . Critic Lyman B. Hagen disagrees with Cudjoe 's judgment that Angelou 's second autobiography lacked a moral center , saying that even though there are many unsavory characters in the book and that their lifestyles are not condemned , the innocent Rita emerges triumphant and " evil does not prevail " . Rita moves through a sleazy world with good intentions and grows stronger as a result of her exposure to it . Hagen states that if were not for Gather Together 's complex literary style , its content would prevent it from being accepted as " an exemplary literary effort " . 
 Although Caged Bird was refreshing in its honesty , something its readers and reviewers value , Angelou 's honesty in Gather Together had become , as reviewer John McWhorter perceives it , " more and more formulaic " . McWhorter asserts that the events that Angelou describes in Gather Together and in her subsequent autobiographies require more explanation , which she does not provide , although she expects her readers to accept them on face value . In Gather Together , for example , Angelou insists that she is not religious , but she refuses welfare , and even though she was afraid of becoming a lesbian in Caged Bird and presents herself as shy , awkward , and bookish , she pimps for a lesbian couple and becomes a prostitute herself . McWhorter criticizes Angelou for her decisions in Gather Together , and for not explaining them fully , and states , " The people in these flamboyant tales — the narrator included — have a pulp @-@ novel incoherence " . 
 Rita 's many physical movements throughout the book causes Hagen to call it a travel narrative . According to Lupton , this movement also affects the book 's organization and quality , making it a less satisfactory sequel to Caged Bird . Angelou has responded to this criticism by stating that she attempted to capture " the episodic , erratic nature of adolescence " as she experienced this period in her life . McPherson agreed , states that Gather Together 's structure is more complex than Caged Bird . Angelou 's style in Gather Together is more mature and simplified , which allows her to better convey emotion and insight through , as McPherson described it , " sharp and vivid word images " . 
 = Pećanac Chetniks = 
 The Pećanac Chetniks , also known as the Black Chetniks , were a collaborationist Chetnik irregular military force which operated in the German @-@ occupied territory of Serbia under the leadership of vojvoda ( war lord ) Kosta Pećanac . They were loyal to the German @-@ backed Serbian puppet government . 
 Pećanac was eventually denounced as a traitor by the Yugoslav government @-@ in @-@ exile , and the Germans concluded that his detachments were inefficient , unreliable , and of little military aid to them . The Germans and the puppet government disbanded the organisation between September 1942 and March 1943 , and Pećanac was interned for some time afterwards before being killed in mid @-@ 1944 by forces loyal to his Chetnik rival Draža Mihailović . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Pećanac Chetniks were named after their commander , Kosta Pećanac , who was a fighter and later vojvoda in the Serbian Chetnik Organization who had first distinguished himself in fighting against the Ottoman Empire in Macedonia between 1903 and 1910 . In the First Balkan War , fought from October 1912 to May 1913 , Pećanac served as a sergeant in the Royal Serbian Army . During the Second Balkan War , fought from 29 June to 10 August 1913 , he saw combat against the Kingdom of Bulgaria . During World War I , he led bands of Serbian guerillas fighting behind Bulgarian and Austro @-@ Hungarian lines . 
 He was the most prominent figure in the Chetnik movement during the interwar period . He had a leading role in the Association Against Bulgarian Bandits , a notorious organisation that arbitrarily terrorised Bulgarians in the Štip region , part of modern @-@ day Macedonia . He also served as a commander with the Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists ( ORJUNA ) . As a member of parliament , he was present when the Croatian Peasant Party ( HSS ) leader Stjepan Radić and HSS deputies Pavle Radić and Đuro Basariček were killed by the Serb politician Puniša Račić on 20 June 1928 . Prior to the shooting , Pećanac was accused by HSS deputy Ivan Pernar of being responsible for a massacre of 200 Muslims in 1921 . 
 Pećanac became the president of the Chetnik Association in 1932 . By opening membership of the organisation to younger members that had not served in World War I , he grew the organisation during the 1930s from a nationalist veterans ' association focused on protecting veterans ' rights to an aggressively partisan Serb political organisation with 500 @,@ 000 members throughout the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . During this period , Pećanac formed close ties with the far @-@ right Yugoslav Radical Union government of Milan Stojadinović , and was known for his hostility to the Yugoslav Communist Party , which made him popular with conservatives such as those in the Yugoslav Radical Union . 
 = = Formation = = 
 Shortly before the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , the Yugoslav Ministry of the Army and Navy requested that Pećanac prepare for guerrilla operations and guard the southern area of Serbia , Macedonia , and Kosovo from pro @-@ Bulgarians and pro @-@ Albanians in the region . He was given arms and money , and managed to arm several hundred men in the Toplica River valley in southern Serbia . Pećanac 's force remained intact after the German occupation of Serbia and supplemented its strength from Serb refugees fleeing Macedonia and Kosovo . In the early summer of 1941 , Pećanac 's detachments fought against Albanian bands . At this time and for a considerable period after , only detachments under Pećanac were identified by the term " Chetnik " . With the formation of the communist @-@ led Yugoslav Partisans , Pećanac gave up any interest in resistance , and by late August came to agreements with both the Serbian puppet government and the German authorities to carry out attacks against the Partisans . 
 Pećanac kept the organisational structure of his detachments simple . All of the commanders were selected personally by Pećanac and consisted of former officers , peasants , Orthodox priests , teachers , and merchants . The Pećanac Chetniks were also known as the " Black Chetniks " . 
 = = Collaboration with occupation and quisling forces = = 
 On 18 August 1941 , while he was concluding arrangements with the Germans , Pećanac received a letter from rival Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović proposing an arrangement where Pećanac would control the Chetniks south of the Western Morava River while Mihailović would control the Chetniks in all other areas . Pećanac declined this request and suggested that he might offer Mihailović the position as his chief of staff . He also recommended that Mihailović 's detachments disband and join his organisation . In the meantime , Pećanac had arranged for the transfer of several thousand of his Chetniks to the Serbian Gendarmerie to act as German auxiliaries . 
 On 27 August , Pećanac issued an open " Proclamation to the Dear People " , in which he portrayed himself as the defender and protector of Serbs and , referring to Mihailović 's units , called on " detachments that have been formed without his approval " to come together under his command . He demanded that individuals hiding in the forests return to their homes immediately and that acts of sabotage directed at the occupation authorities cease or suffer the punishment of death . 
 In September 1941 , some of Pećanac 's subordinates broke ranks to join the Partisans in fighting the Germans and their Serbian auxiliaries . In the mountainous Kopaonik region , a previously loyal subordinate of Pećanac began attacking local gendarmerie stations and clashing with armed bands of Albanian Muslims . By the end of October the Germans decided to stop arming the " unreliable " elements within Pećanac 's Chetniks , and attached the remainder to their other Serbian auxiliary forces . 
 On 7 October 1941 , Pećanac sent a request to the head of the Serbian puppet government , Milan Nedić , for trained officers , supplies , arms , salary funds , and more . Over time his requests were fulfilled , and a German liaison officer was appointed at Pećanac 's headquarters to help coordinate actions . On 17 January 1942 , according to German data , 72 Chetnik officers and 7 @,@ 963 men were being paid and supplied by the Serbian Gendarmerie . This fell short of their maximum authorised strength of 8 @,@ 745 men , and included two or three thousand of Mihailović 's Chetniks who had been " legalised " in November 1941 . In the same month , Pećanac sought permission from the Italians for his forces to move into eastern Montenegro , but was refused due to Italian concerns that the Chetniks would move into the Sandžak . 
 In April 1942 , the German Commanding General in Serbia , General der Artillerie Paul Bader , issued orders giving the unit numbers C – 39 to C – 101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments , which were placed under the command of the local German division or area command post . These orders required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations , and also limited their movement outside their assigned area . Supplies of arms and ammunition were also controlled by the Germans . In July 1942 , Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government @-@ in @-@ exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor , and his continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I. 
 = = Dissolution = = 
 The Germans found that Pećanac 's units were inefficient , unreliable , and of little military aid to them . Pećanac 's Chetniks regularly clashed and had rivalries with other German auxiliaries such as the Serbian State Guard and Serbian Volunteer Command and also with Mihailović 's Chetniks . The Germans and the puppet government commenced disbanding them in September 1942 , and all but one had been dissolved by the end of that year . The last detachment was disbanded in March 1943 . His followers were dispersed to other German auxiliary forces , German labour units , or were interned in prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camps . Many deserted to join Mihailović . Nothing is recorded of Pećanac 's activities in the months that followed except that he was interned for some time by the Serbian puppet government . Accounts of Pećanac 's capture and death vary . According to one account , Pećanac , four of his leaders and 40 of their followers were captured by forces loyal to Mihailović in February 1944 . All were killed within days except Pećanac , who remained in custody to write his war memoirs before being executed on 5 May 1944 . Another source states he was assassinated on 6 June 1944 by Chetniks loyal to Mihailović .

 Writers from the fields of religion , philosophy , popular culture , and psychology cited the episode in books discussing The Simpsons and the show 's approach to the nature of the soul . The episode was positively received by the media , and is regarded as one of the seventh season 's and the series ' best . The creative team of The Simpsons puts the episode among the top five best episodes of the series , and series creator Matt Groening cited " Bart Sells His Soul " as one of his favorite episodes . It has been used by secondary schools in religious education courses as a teaching tool . This episode is considered by many fans and critics as one of the darkest episodes from The Simpsons . 
 = = Plot = = 
 During a church service , Bart tricks the congregation by distributing the lyrics to a hymn titled " In the Garden of Eden " by " I. Ron Butterfly " , which is actually the psychedelic rock song " In @-@ A @-@ Gadda @-@ Da @-@ Vida " by Iron Butterfly , that the unwitting parishioners and organist proceed to perform for 17 minutes , after which the elderly organist passes out from exhaustion . Reverend Lovejoy demands that the perpetrator step forward , with threats of fire and brimstone , at which Milhouse <unk> on Bart. Lovejoy sentences Bart ( as well as Milhouse for tattling ) to clean the pipe organ . Bart is indignant with Milhouse , who apologizes but was fearful of losing his soul . Bart proclaims that there is no such thing as a soul and for $ 5 agrees to sell his to Milhouse in the form of a piece of paper saying " Bart Simpson 's soul " . Lisa warns that Bart will regret selling his soul , but he dismisses her fears . However , Bart soon finds that Santa 's Little Helper and Snowball II seem hostile towards him , automatic doors fail to open for him , when he breathes on the freezer doors at the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart no condensation forms , and he can no longer laugh at Itchy & Scratchy cartoons . Suspecting he literally lost his soul , he sets out to retrieve it . 
 Bart attempts to retrieve his soul from Milhouse , who agrees to sell it ... for $ 50 , then laughs at Bart for being the fool . That night , Bart has a nightmare about being the only child in Springfield who does not have a soul . Lisa torments Bart with a dinnertime prayer leading him to make a desperate , all @-@ out attempt to get the piece of paper back . Bart crosses town to where Milhouse and his parents are staying with his grandmother while their house is being fumigated . The visit turns out to be fruitless ; Milhouse had traded the paper to Comic Book Guy at the Android 's Dungeon . A frustrated Bart runs off into the night . He encounters Ralph Wiggum in his father 's police cruiser and attempts to buy his soul . When Ralph refuses he hisses and disappears in a vale of smoke and haze . 
 The following morning , an annoyed Comic Book Guy tells Bart that he no longer has the piece of paper but refuses to reveal to whom he sold it . Bart walks home in the rain , then in his room he prays to God for his soul . Suddenly , a piece of paper with the words " Bart Simpson 's soul " floats down from above . Bart discovers that Lisa had purchased the piece of paper . While she explains philosophers ' opinions on the human soul , Bart happily devours the piece of paper . Realizing how uninterested Bart was in about her lecture about the human soul , Lisa tells him that she hoped he learned his lesson from this . At night when Bart goes to bed , he and his soul are having fun with their quirks , proving that Bart did learn his lesson in the consequences of selling his soul . 
 In the subplot , Moe attempts to expand his customer base by converting his tavern into a family restaurant called " Uncle Moe 's Family <unk> " , after numerous unhelpful concept ideas from Homer . The restaurant turns out to be a T.G.I. Friday 's @-@ style restaurant full of tacky decorations and gimmicks , including one where a special French Fries dish is served with the basket strapped to Moe 's head . However , the stress of running a family restaurant by himself ultimately starts to drive him unhinged , especially his ill @-@ conceived policy of voiding the bill for anyone he does not smile for when he gives it to them . Finally , driven over the edge , he yells at a little girl who complained that the soda was too cold . The family patrons are outraged and abandon the restaurant , forcing Moe to return the restaurant to the run @-@ down tavern .

 " Bart Sells His Soul " was the second episode to have Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein as executive producers . Oakley and Weinstein wanted to start the season with episodes that had an emotional bias in an effort to center the Simpson family . The episode was written by Greg Daniels , who originally had an idea for a plot that dealt with racism in Springfield . The writers did not think The Simpsons was the right forum for it , so Daniels suggested the idea of selling someone 's soul , which originated in his childhood . In high school , Daniels encouraged a bully to sell him his soul for 50 cents , and then convinced classmates to frighten the bully into buying his soul back for an inflated price . Daniels repeated this ploy , but stopped when he realized that the only other person in history who has profited off others ' souls was Satan , and that " scared " him . In the opening scene of the episode , the congregation of the First Church of Springfield are tricked into singing " In a Gadda Da Vida " by Iron Butterfly . Daniels had originally intended for the song to be " Jesus He Knows Me " by British rock band Genesis , but the producers were unable to obtain the rights for it to be featured in the episode . 
 The episode was directed by Wesley Archer . Archer and his team of animators went to the restaurant chain Chili 's to get inspiration for the background designs of Moe 's family restaurant . He said it was " quite a task " to transform Moe 's Tavern into a family @-@ oriented establishment . Archer added that he was not " quite happy " with the result , and that they could have designed it " a little better " . Weinstein recalled that there was contention between the animators about the way Moe looked in the episode . Moe 's original design includes a missing tooth , but Weinstein and Oakley felt that it did not " look right " because Moe was such a prominent character in the episode . Archer showed the original design of Moe from the first season to the show runners , and said : " Here , look . He 's got a missing tooth ! " , but the scenes that had Moe with a missing tooth in them were still reanimated . Archer was disappointed with the dream sequence in which Bart sees his friends playing with their souls . Archer said that he had forgotten to tell the animators to make the souls transparent , so they were painted blue instead . 
 In the American version of this episode , in the segment where Moe has an outburst and Todd says , " Ow ! My freakin ' ears ! " , Flanders says that he expects to hear bad language at Denny 's . In the German dub , " Denny 's " is replaced with " McDonald 's & Burger King " , since McDonald 's & Burger King are known more in other countries than Denny 's is . Similarly , in the Italian dub Ned mentions Burger King instead of Denny 's .

 Kurt M. Koenigsberger comments in Leaving Springfield that " a good deal of enjoyment " is to be had from the episode , due to " the exposure of the hypocrisy behind ' the finance of salvation ' and the ambivalent operations of the commercial world " . Don <unk> , a fellow of Emmanuel College , Cambridge , believes that when Lisa lectures Bart about the soul , she " shows a degree of theological sophistication which is simply not tolerated in Britain . " Paul Bloom and David Pizarro write in The Psychology of The Simpsons that although Lisa does show " healthy religious skepticism " she still believes in an eternal soul . However , Lisa tells Bart at the end of the episode , " some philosophers believe that no one is born with a soul , you have to earn one through suffering " . Bloom and Pizarro acknowledge " Indeed , some philosophers and theologians say that without belief in a soul , one cannot make sense of the social concepts on which we rely , such as personal responsibility and freedom of the will . " 
 M. Keith Booker cites the episode in Drawn to Television , while discussing The Simpsons treatment of religion . Booker cites a scene from the episode where Milhouse asks Bart what religions have to gain by lying about concepts such as the existence of a soul – and then the scene cuts to Reverend Lovejoy counting his money ; Booker believes that this implies that religions create mythologies so that they can gain money from followers . He juxtaposes this with Bart 's realization later in the episode that " life suddenly feels empty and incomplete " without a soul , which suggests " either that the soul is real or it is at least a useful fiction " . Mark I. Pinsky and Samuel F. Parvin discuss the episode in their book The Gospel According to the Simpsons : Leader 's Guide for Group Study , and use examples from it to stimulate discussion among youth about the nature of the soul . Pinsky and Parvin note Bart 's statement to Milhouse from the beginning of the episode : " Soul — come on , Milhouse , there 's no such thing as a soul . It 's just something they made up to scare kids , like the Boogie Man or Michael Jackson , " and then suggest questions to ask students , including whether they know individuals that agree with Bart , and their views on the existence of a soul . 
 In Planet Simpson , Chris Turner quotes Bart 's revelation to Lisa that he sold his soul to Milhouse for five dollars and used the money to buy sponges shaped like dinosaurs . After Lisa criticizes Bart for selling his soul , Bart responds : " Poor gullible Lisa . I 'll keep my crappy sponges , thanks . " Turner comments " Here Bart is the epitome of the world @-@ weary hipster , using the degraded language of modern marketing to sell off the most sacred parts of himself because he knows that some cheap sponge is more real , hence more valuable , than even the loftiest of abstract principles . "

 On the DVD audio commentary for the episode , writer Greg Daniels cited Martin Scorsese 's 1985 film After Hours as an influence on Bart 's night @-@ time trek to retrieve his soul from Milhouse , only to experience a series of unusual encounters . Reverend Lovejoy leads his congregation in a hymnal version of the song " In @-@ A @-@ Gadda @-@ Da @-@ Vida " , by Iron Butterfly , titled " In the Garden of Eden " , by " I. Ron Butterfly " . The version of the song in The Simpsons episode lasts for 17 minutes ; and Reverend Lovejoy inspects the music and states that it " sounds like rock and / or roll . " 
 During an argument between Lisa and Bart , while discussing the relationship between laughter and the soul , Lisa quotes Chilean poet Pablo Neruda , and Bart responds " I am familiar with the works of Pablo Neruda . " Kurt M. Koenigsberger comments in Leaving Springfield " While Bart may be familiar with the canon of Chilean poetry , the joke takes its force in part from the probability that The Simpsons ' viewers are not . " Bart begins a prayer to God with " Are you there , God ? It 's me , Bart Simpson " . This is a parody of the book Are You There God ? It 's Me , Margaret . , by Judy Blume .

The Intelligencer Journal described " Bart Sells His Soul " as " a particularly good episode " of The Simpsons . The Lansing State Journal highlighted the episode in the season seven DVD release , along with the conclusion of " Who Shot Mr. Burns " and " The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular " . The Sunday Herald Sun called it one of the " show 's most memorable episodes " , as did The Courier Mail . 
 The Aberdeen Press & Journal described the episode as " one of the darkest episodes of the Simpsons " . In their section on the episode in the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood comment : " Undoubtedly the most disturbing episode of the series , with Bart 's nightmare of losing his soul — illustrated by a macabre playground where all the souls of his playmates are visible , and his is tagging along with Milhouse — more frightening than funny . ... An illustration of just how far the series could go by this point . " 
 In April 2003 , the episode was listed by The Simpsons creative team as among the top five best episodes of the series , including " Last Exit to Springfield " , " Cape Feare " , " 22 Short Films About Springfield " , and " Homer at the Bat " . In a 2005 interview The Simpsons creator Matt Groening commented " I don 't have a single favorite . There 's a bunch I really like , " but cited " Bart Sells His Soul " and " Homer 's Enemy " as among episodes he loves . Bart 's voice actress Nancy Cartwright stated " Bart Sells His Soul " is one of her top three episodes together with " Lisa 's Substitute " and " Bart the Mother " . 
 The episode has been used in church courses about the nature of a soul in Connecticut , and in the United Kingdom , and was shown by a minister in Scotland in one of his sermons . A 2005 report on religious education in secondary schools , by the United Kingdom education watchdog group Office for Standards in Education , Children 's Services and Skills ( Ofsted ) , noted that the episode was being used as a teaching tool .

 U @-@ 11 was a small coastal submarine that displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) surfaced and 141 tonnes ( 139 long tons ) submerged . She featured a single shaft , a single 60 bhp ( 45 kW ) Körting diesel engine for surface running , and a single 120 shp ( 89 kW ) electric motor for submerged travel . U @-@ 11 was capable of up to 6 @.@ 5 knots ( 12 @.@ 0 km / h ; 7 @.@ 5 mph ) while surfaced and 5 @.@ 5 knots ( 10 @.@ 2 km / h ; 6 @.@ 3 mph ) while submerged at a diving depth of up to 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . She was designed for a crew of 17 officers and men . 
 U @-@ 11 was equipped with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes . German Type UB I submarines were additionally equipped with a 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun , but it is not clear from sources if U @-@ 11 – a former German boat – was fitted with one , or if it was , retained it in Austro @-@ Hungarian service .

 UB @-@ 15 was laid down on 9 November 1914 at AG Weser in Bremen . The submarine was shipped by rail in sections to Pola , where the sections were riveted together .
