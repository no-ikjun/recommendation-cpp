 = Ways That Are Dark = 
 Ways That Are Dark : The Truth About China is a 1933 non @-@ fiction book by Ralph Townsend which presents Townsend 's observations on the state of then @-@ contemporary China . The book is considered an anti @-@ Chinese polemic . 
 A harsh critique of Chinese society and culture , Ways That Are Dark was written at a time when China was in the grip of considerable civil strife . Townsend claimed that the source of China 's problems lay in fundamental defects in the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people . Although the book was a bestseller in the United States , it met with highly polarized reactions from its supporters and detractors . Though praised by some periodicals , it was denounced by missionaries and sinologists , including Owen Lattimore who condemned it as " a general indictment of a whole race " . It was banned by the government of China . 
 After World War II , the book fell into obscurity . It was reprinted in 1997 by the white nationalist publisher Barnes Review and subsequently gained renewed popularity in Japan in 2004 when a Japanese translation was published . 
 = = Background = = 
 Ways That Are Dark is based on its author 's experience of living in China for more than one year . Townsend had worked as a journalist and educator in New York before joining the United States Foreign Service on 16 December 1930 . He served as a vice @-@ consul in Shanghai between 10 December 1931 and 9 January 1932 and then in Fuzhou until 1 March 1933 . The book was released on 10 November 1933 by G. P. Putnam 's Sons . 
 = = Summary of contents = = 
 In his introduction , Townsend describes the book as " an honest attempt to present the facts as they are , however unpleasant " and a counterbalance to the " maudlin sentiment " and " misinformation " of other writers on China who have made " fatuous attempts to sprinkle bright hopes over dark facts . " He argues that existing literature available in the West is skewed in favor of China because of the demands for " political correctness " on the part of publishers and the vested interests of the three major categories of foreigners in China , the missionaries , businesspeople and government officials . He notes that while China 's virtues will speak for themselves , " in appraising a stranger with whom we are to deal , it is important to know his shortcomings " . 
 In the first two chapters he describes the atrocious conditions he witnessed in China . Shanghai is depicted as a squalid , noisy , and polluted den of crime , poverty , and disease , and yet still comparatively wealthy compared to the rest of the country . The interior of the country is difficult to access due to lack of infrastructure , is mostly unsafe for travel , and is wracked constantly by famine and starvation . 
 Townsend had asserted in chapter one that the cause of China 's present misery lies in the fundamental defects that exist in the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people and in chapters three and four he explains what he believes these defects are . Townsend states that dishonesty is " the most prominent characteristic in the Chinese mentality as opposed to our own " . Townsend gives many examples of him being lied to by Chinese employees , coolies , shopkeepers , and government officials , and notes that many other consuls were driven out of the service by this relentless and " aimless lying , with each lie merely a pretext for another " . The other highly salient trait of the Chinese is their " indifference to fellow suffering " . Through a large number of personal and second @-@ hand anecdotes , Townsend argues that the Chinese may be the only people in the world who are completely unable to comprehend the basic human impulses of sympathy or gratitude toward other people . Because the Chinese feel no empathy toward others , they behave in an unbelievably sadistic and cruel fashion toward one another , and they view altruistic foreigners as targets to be mercilessly taken advantage of . Other traits Townsend identifies as being typically Chinese are cowardice , lust for money , lack of a sense of personal hygiene , lack of critical thinking skills , insincerity , and obsession with hollow rites . Townsend believes that these traits are as notable among China 's leaders and educated strata as much as they are in the poor masses , and his analysis of historical documents leads him to believe that they are not a recent product of the present chaos , but rather are deeply ingrained traits of China 's national character . He concludes that the " outstanding characteristics " of the Chinese people " neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them , nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves . " 
 In chapters five and six Townsend discusses US @-@ funded charitable organizations in China , especially missions . He points out that although the United States had given at least $ 160 million in philanthropy to China , these charities in China , even secular hospitals and schools , are generally preyed upon by the very Chinese people who the charitable workers seek to help . These charities are subject to rampant looting , arson , and murderous mob violence by Chinese people who their government refuses to prosecute . Much of this violence is incited by the anti @-@ foreigner propaganda of the KMT , a party described as being " worse than the Ku Klux Klan at its most degenerate stage " , and through US aid to China Townsend suggests that America is actually bankrolling propaganda against itself . Though the missionaries are sincere and hard @-@ working , Townsend finds that they suffer from extreme delusion over the ultimate futility of their goal of reforming the Chinese . The missionaries , he states , have willfully ignored overwhelming evidence that no degree of care or education can uproot the intrinsic sickness of Chinese culture . He calls for an end to all missionary and charitable work in China . 
 In chapter seven Townsend details the sheer horror of China 's ongoing civil war . Among the factions competing for power in China , Townsend believes that none of them , neither the leaders nor their men , have any fixed loyalties or higher motivations apart from desire for loot . With every man only out for himself and " China 's microscopically few good men ... too weak to be felt " , Townsend predicts no end to the chaos . Much of the violence , Townsend explains in chapter eight , is fuelled by opium , the addiction of one out of every eight Chinese . Peasants are often compelled to plant opium by local administrators and warlords to pay for their armies , to such an extent that many districts are more heavily planted with opium than food , and all the while KMT officials lie incessantly to the international community about their efforts to suppress the trade . In contrast to the depredations of the KMT and other warlords , in chapter nine Townsend praises the positive influence of the Japanese in China . The Japanese themselves are considered by him to be a loyal , brave , reliable , honest , and cleanly people , and thus the polar opposites of the Chinese . Townsend provides his own firsthand account of the Shanghai Incident of 1932 , which he claims was probably provoked by Chinese aggression , and similarly sees the Japanese decision to invade Manchuria as a fitting response to the " foredoomed contest of covert violence against the Japanese " waged by Zhang Xueliang . Townsend also lavishes praise on the puppet state of Manchukuo as " a blessing to the thirty million or so Chinese living there " which has achieved " stability and well @-@ being for millions " . Townsend concludes that informed observers are grateful for Japan 's role in dealing with an unruly China . 
 Finally , in chapter ten Townsend affirms that the " backward Chinese " are America ’ s " only legitimate problem in Asia " and asks what can be done to deal with a nation that spends aid money corruptly , does not respect its loans , mistreats and attacks foreigners , ignores international drug laws , will not protect foreign investment , and does not engage in productive diplomacy with other nations . He warns Americans that the Chinese see kindness only as weakness and thus can never respond to any type of positive reinforcement . " For every Chinese , from highest to lowest , " he argues , " all the acts of life are concentrated upon extracting , from those who mean nothing to him , what he can for the benefit of himself and his clan . " By contrast , he believes that the Chinese do understand force and respect strength . Therefore , he advocates that the United States forgo naive " sentimentalist " thinking and adopt a policy of " stern insistence upon our rights without cruel abuse of our strength " , including withholding further loans without strict conditions and holding on to foreign concessions and extraterritoriality .

 Ways That Are Dark hit the bestsellers list in the United States , and The <unk> noted that the book " was given lavish praise and bitter abuse by some of the leading newspapers in America " . It was advertised as doing " for China what Katherine Mayo did for Mother India " , and Foreign Affairs magazine described it as " a sensationally unorthodox and unvarnished picture of the Chinese " . 
 = = = Praise = = = 
 E. Francis Brown , writing for Current History , approved of the book 's comprehensive and frank discussion of conditions within China . Though the book takes a strongly negative stance towards China , Brown argued that " this very unfriendliness makes the book a welcome antidote to much that has been written in recent years and some of its conclusions might be well pondered by those who shape America 's Far Eastern Policy . " Willis J. Abbot of the Christian Science Monitor especially praised Townsend 's study of the social life and customs of the Chinese and claimed that " Any capable observer with a few weeks at his disposal in China will corroborate much that appears in this volume . " His praise was echoed by Douglas Jerrold of The English Review who found the work " brilliant and outspoken " . 
 = = = Negative criticism = = = 
 By contrast , Lewis S. Gannett of The Nation criticized Townsend for writing an " apology for Japan " and painting the Chinese as " all alike , all generically different from Japanese and Westerners " . A similarly negative assessment published in The China Weekly Review observed that " A Chinese might easily write a similar book and by emphasizing the activities of the <unk> and <unk> , the bootleggers , kidnappers and racketeers , prove to his own satisfaction at least that the Americans constituted a degenerate branch of the white race . " The Republican concluded its review of the book with " Throughout the presentation of his observations runs a thread of ill @-@ considered bias which taints his words . We must look to other ... more discerning writers for the truth about China . " 
 Prominent sinologists were also critical of the work . In the pages of The New York Times , Owen Lattimore condemned Ways That Are Dark as " a general indictment of a whole race " which lacks insight , contains factual errors , and relies on second @-@ hand accounts . He stated that the book would " only convince people who are convinced already . " Nathaniel <unk> likewise denounced the book as " a rehash of all the old patter of the <unk> hotel lobbies , with all its half @-@ truths , inaccuracies , provincialism , ignorance and sometimes crassness ... [ Townsend ] has not managed to observe accurately the most simple and superficial things . " <unk> Bland , though deeming Townsend 's conclusions " as a whole ... unconvincing " , at least found the chapter on opium " particularly instructive . " 
 Also among the book 's detractors were missionaries , whom Townsend had criticized . They reviewed the book negatively in a variety of periodicals , including The Chinese Recorder , which accused Townsend of having " gathered a lot of stories and put them together in a clever , cynical and unusually warped way " . Other negative reviews appeared in The Missionary Review of the World , The China Christian Year Book , and The Missionary Herald at Home and Abroad . 
 Ways That Are Dark continues to be noted for its <unk> viewpoint . In 1985 the historian Frank P. Mintz called it " a classic in the literature of <unk> . " In 2000 the scholar Yong Chen referred to Townsend 's attitude towards the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people as being derivative of " the anti @-@ Chinese prejudice that nineteenth @-@ century writers had propagated . " In 2004 the writer Gregory Clark described it as " a viciously anti @-@ China book " that " contrasts an allegedly dirty , devious Chinese nation with the trustworthy , hardworking Japanese " . 
 Though the book was originally to be called " Chinese Merry @-@ Go @-@ Round " , the title under which it was ultimately published is a quote from Bret Harte 's poem " The Heathen Chinee " . Though " The Heathen Chinee " had been used a rallying cry by opponents of Chinese immigration to the United States , Harte had intended it as a parody of the anti @-@ Chinese bigotry prevalent in the United States of the nineteenth century . 
 = = = Political responses = = = 
 The Japanese Army and Navy strongly approved of the book and several thousand copies of it were bought by the War Ministry and Naval Ministry who by the beginning of 1934 were distributing the books for free to foreign journalists and officials . By contrast , the Nationalist Government of China responded by banning Townsend 's book throughout China from 1935 . Even so , the journalist George <unk> reported that in 1946 Chinese communists distributed contraband copies of the book to American China Marines in the hopes of disillusioning them about conditions in China . 
 = = Revival in Japanese translation = = 
 Ways That Are Dark was already in its fifth printing by 1937 , but in 1942 Townsend was imprisoned for having accepted money from the Japanese Committee on Trade and Information between 1937 and 1940 without registering as a foreign agent . The book was not re @-@ printed again until the white supremacist magazine Barnes Review published a new edition in 1997 . 
 The Barnes Review edition was subsequently translated into Japanese in 2004 by a pair of Japanese translators , Hideo Tanaka and Kenkichi Sakita , and became an instant success , selling out 10 successive re @-@ printings before 2007 when it was reissued as a mass market paperback . Gregory Clark noted that the Japanese edition of Ways That Are Dark , which was entitled Ankoku <unk> Chūgoku no <unk> ( " The Truth About the Dark Continent China " ) , had garnered widespread popularity among members of the Japanese right @-@ wing . 
 Tanaka , one of the translators of the book , praised Townsend in Shokun ! magazine for his " penetrating insight " in reporting " starkly and vividly on the true nature of the Chinese that he had witnessed firsthand " . Sakita , the other translator , likewise lauded the book in an article written for <unk> Fujioka 's Association for Advancement of <unk> View of History . Sakita called the book " essential reading to understand what China really is " and argued that Townsend 's ideas continue to offer important lessons in conducting Sino @-@ Japanese relations today . The book was also reviewed positively by the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun . 
 = Buah Rindu = 
 <unk> <unk> ( Perfected Spelling : Buah Rindu , Indonesian for Fruits of Longing ) is a 1941 poetry collection by Amir Hamzah . The poems date to Amir 's first years in Java , between 1928 and 1935 . According to Anthony Johns of Australia National University , the poems are arranged chronologically , as indicated by Amir 's increasing maturity as a writer while developing the poems . The collection includes twenty @-@ three titled poems and two untitled pieces . Ten of the poems had previously been published , including Amir 's first published works ( both from 1932 ) , " Mabuk ... " and " Sunyi " . 
 In Buah Rindu , Amir shows an affinity for using traditional Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain , but unlike the highly fixed traditional forms , he mixes the rhyming patterns . The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching , and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw the collection is united by a theme of longing . Johns states that the imagery in Buah Rindu is dependent on traditional Malay literature , and that Amir 's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry . The author 's use of language is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas , and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature , with references to Hindu gods and goddesses . 
 Buah Rindu was published in its entirety in the June 1941 edition of Poedjangga Baroe , a magazine Amir had helped establish in 1933 . It was later republished as a stand @-@ alone book by Poestaka Rakjat in Jakarta . 
 = = Background = = 
 Amir Hamzah ( 1911 – 46 ) was a Dutch @-@ educated Malay writer of noble descent . He was well @-@ oriented in traditional Malay literature , with favourites including historical texts such as Hikayat Hang Tuah , Syair Siti Zubaidah , and Hikayat Panca Tanderan . Amir likewise read works of Arabic , Persian , and Hindu literature . As a result , he had an extensive vocabulary . 
 Although Buah Rindu was published in 1941 , four years after Amir 's debut collection Nyanyi Sunyi , general consensus is that its poems are less recent . The poems in Buah Rindu date to the period between 1928 and 1935 , Amir 's first years in Java ; the collection gives the two years , as well the location of writing as Jakarta – Solo ( Surakarta ) – Jakarta . The dates of the poems themselves are unclear . None of Amir 's works are dated , meaning a definite date is impossible to establish . There are several hypotheses . Nh . Dini , in her biography of Amir , suggests that some , such as " Tinggallah " , were written not long after he boarded the Plancus , on his way to Java . Anthony Johns of Australia National University suggests that the poems are arranged chronologically , pointing to the increasing maturity Amir shows as a writer while the poems develop . 
 = = Contents = = 
 Buah Rindu contains twenty @-@ three titled poems and two untitled pieces : a short quatrain at the beginning of the book and a three @-@ line dedication at the end . The closing dedication reads " to the lord , Greater Indonesia / to the ashes of the Mother @-@ Queen / and to the feet of the Sendari @-@ Goddess " , Achdiat Karta Mihardja , a classmate of Amir 's , writes that Amir 's Javanese sweetheart Ilik Sundari was immediately recognisable to any of Amir 's classmates ; he considers her the poet 's inspiration as " Laura to Petrarch , Mathilde to Jacques Perk " . 
 The titled poems are as follows : 
 Of the poems included in Buah Rindu , ten had previously been published . These included Amir 's first published works , " Mabuk ... " and " Sunyi " , which had been included in the March 1932 edition of the magazine Timboel , as well as " Dagang " , " Hang Tuah " , " Harum <unk> " , " <unk> @-@ <unk> " , " Malam " , " <unk> Aku " , " <unk> <unk> " , and " Naik @-@ Naik " . The other works had never previously seen wide readership . 
 = = Style = = 
 In Buah Rindu , particularly its earlier poems , Amir shows an affinity for using traditional Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain ( found in pantun and syair ) . However , unlike the highly fixed traditional forms , Amir mixes the rhyming patterns ; for instance , one quatrain may have a <unk> ( <unk> ) while the next may have an alternating simple 4 @-@ line ( pantun ) pattern . Lines are generally divided by a clear caesura , and in some cases even two . The caesura may not always be in the centre of a line ; it is at times towards the front , and at times towards the rear . 
 The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching , including <unk> , <unk> ( wandering ) , cinta ( love ) , and <unk> ( passion ) . 
 According to Johns , the imagery in Buah Rindu is highly dependent on traditional Malay literature . Flowers are prominent . In some cases , such as when the lover in " Buah Rindu II " contemplates the clouds , as a " motif which is clearly derivative , but retold in Hamzah 's words is fresh and moving " . Amir 's terminology is likewise heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry . In " Hang Tuah " , for instance , the term <unk> is used to refer to the Portuguese who are attacking Malacca ; the same term can be found in classic texts such as Sejarah Melayu and Hikayat Hang Tuah . Other classic terms include <unk> and <unk> , rather than <unk> <unk> and <unk> ( warship and ship , respectively ) . 
 Amir 's language use is notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas . Johns counts terms unknown in Malay , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . He also notes an apparent influence of the Javanese <unk> poetic form . Another source of influence appears to be Indian literature . Indonesian documentarian HB Jassin finds instances in " Buah Rindu II " , particularly the verses regarding clouds , which are similar with Kālidāsa 's <unk> . Hindu gods and goddesses also make an appearance . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw writes that this collection is united by a theme of longing , which Jassin expands on : Amir is longing for his mother , longing for his loves , and longing for his homeland . All are referred to as " <unk> " ( beloved ) in turn . These longings , Teeuw writes , are unlike the religious overtones of Nyanyi Sunyi : they are more worldly , grounded in reality ; Jassin notes another thematic distinction between the two : unlike Nyanyi Sunyi , with its clear depiction of one god , Buah Rindu explicitly puts forth several deities , including the Hindu gods Shiva and Parvati and abstract ones like the god and goddess of love .

 Buah Rindu was published in its entirety in the June 1941 edition of Poedjangga Baroe , a magazine Amir had helped establish in 1933 . It was later republished as a stand @-@ alone book by Poestaka Rakjat in Jakarta . 
 Johns writes that , though elements of individuality are evident in the collection , " nothing suggests the striking individuality and intensity " of Amir 's later writings . He notes two poems , " Tinggallah " and " Senyum <unk> , Senyum " , as particularly weak . The poet Chairil Anwar , though generally of a positive viewpoint of Amir 's work , disliked Buah Rindu ; he considered it too classical .

 = Typhoon Matsa = 
 Typhoon Matsa , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Gorio , was the second of eight Pacific tropical cyclones to make landfall on China during the 2005 Pacific typhoon season . The ninth tropical storm and fifth typhoon of the season , Matsa developed on July 30 to the east of the Philippines . Matsa intensified as it tracked northwestward , and attained peak 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) near Taiwan before weakening and striking the Chinese province of Zhejiang on August 5 . The system continued northward into the Yellow Sea , and on August 7 Matsa became extratropical after again moving ashore along the Liaodong Peninsula . Matsa is a Laotian name for a lady fish . 
 In Taiwan , Matsa dropped torrential rainfall of up to 1 @,@ 270 mm ( 50 in ) , which caused mudslides and moderate damage across the island . Flooding from the rainfall contaminated some water supplies , leaving around 80 @,@ 000 homes without water at one point ; much of Taoyuan County ( now Taoyuan City ) was without water for at least 5 days . As in Taiwan , the typhoon dropped heavy precipitation in the People 's Republic of China , and in combination with strong winds destroyed about 59 @,@ 000 houses and damaged more than 20 @,@ 000 km2 ( 7 @,@ 700 sq mi ) of croplands . Throughout the country , Matsa caused 25 direct fatalities and ￥ 18 billion ( 2005 CNY , $ 2 @.@ 23 billion 2005 USD ) in damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origin of Typhoon Matsa is traced to the formation of an area of convection about 185 km ( 115 mi ) east of Yap in late July . The convection gradually consolidated over a weak low @-@ level circulation , and at 0300 UTC on July 30 the system was first mentioned in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) Significant Tropical Weather Outlook . Located within an area of moderate wind shear , the system continued to slowly organize , and by 1200 UTC on July 30 it was sufficiently organized for the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) to classify it as a weak tropical depression while located about 65 km ( 40 mi ) east of Yap . Shortly thereafter , the JTWC followed suit by issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert . The depression tracked steadily westward , followed by a turn to the northwest on July 31 under the influence of a mid @-@ level ridge to its east . It continued to organize , and at 1200 UTC on July 31 it intensified into Tropical Storm Matsa ; the depression was unofficially classified a tropical storm six hours earlier by the JTWC . Additionally , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) named the system Tropical Storm Gorio , due to its location within the administration 's area of responsibility . 
 Tropical Storm Matsa gradually intensified as it tracked steadily northwestward ; by late on August 1 it strengthened into a severe tropical storm . Outflow and deep convection to the north remained limited , though the storm was able to intensity further to attain typhoon status on August 2 about 780 km ( 480 mi ) south of Okinawa . Intensification slowed , and late on August 3 Matsa reached a peak intensity of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) while located 495 km ( 308 mi ) east of the southern tip of Taiwan as reported by the JMA ; the JTWC and the National Meteorological Center of China reported the typhoon as strengthening further to attain peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) on August 4 . Shortly after passing over the Japanese island of Ishigaki , Matsa began to weaken steadily as it approached the coast of China , and made landfall as a minimal typhoon late on August 5 near <unk> in the southern region of Zhejiang Province . It crossed the Gulf of Yueqing and 40 minutes after its first landfall it struck Mainland China near Yueqing . It quickly weakened to a tropical storm , and within hours of moving ashore the JTWC issued its last advisory . Matsa turned to the north , weakening to a tropical depression on August 7 shortly before entering the Yellow Sea . The weakening depression continued northward , and became an extratropical cyclone on August 9 after hitting the Liaodong Peninsula . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 The Taiwan Central Weather Bureau warned for the potential for heavy amounts of rainfall across the island . This resulted in officials to close schools and offices in Taipei . Additionally , the typhoon caused the cancellation or delay of several flights in and out of Taipei , though complete air service was restored by the day after Matsa 's passage . The Taiwan Stock Exchange closed due to the threat of the typhoon . 
 Prior to the arrival of the typhoon , officials in China ordered the evacuation of about 2 @.@ 3 million people , mostly in Zhejiang . The typhoon also resulted in the cancellation or delay of thousands of flights , with the two main airports in Shanghai closed for 30 hours . Officials near Matsa 's projected landfall were advised to lower the levels in reservoirs to mitigate the threat of flooding . In Zhejiang , officials set up shelters for about 35 @,@ 000 boats to prevent marine damage . Due to the potential for rough seas , officials closed the port at Ningbo and Shanghai and also canceled some ferry service . Matsa was predicted to be first typhoon to affect Beijing in 11 years by dropping heavy amounts of rainfall . Local officials advised water operators to lower water levels to prevent flooding . Up to 100 mm ( 4 in ) of rainfall was forecast for the city , and officials prepared to evacuate 40 @,@ 000 residents in the outskirts of the city .

 While passing to the north of Taiwan , Matsa produced strong winds reaching 144 km / h ( 89 mph ) , with gusts of up to 188 km / h ( 117 mph ) . The storm dropped heavy rainfall across the island , with precipitation totals reaching up to 1270 mm ( 50 in ) in a 30 ‑ hour period ; one station located in Taitung County recorded 843 mm ( 33 @.@ 2 in ) in one day , which was the highest daily rainfall total in association with the storm . The rainfall led to flooding and mudslides throughout the island . In response to the flooding , residents placed sandbags around houses and office buildings to prevent flood damage . The mudslides blocked roads across the mountainous region , leaving hundreds stranded , and in combination with flooding the mudslides washed away several bridges and damaged some roadways . Strong winds left 56 @,@ 211 houses without power , most of which were quickly repaired . Typhoon Matsa caused moderate crop damage across the island , which was still recovering from the damage caused by Typhoon <unk> a month before . More than 80 @,@ 000 homes were left without water due to the passage of the typhoon . Subsequent flooding left more than 630 @,@ 000 homes without water or receiving water at infrequent intervals . About 368 ha ( 909 acres ) of crop fields were destroyed , and crop damage from Matsa totaled NT $ 47 million ( 2005 TWD , $ 1 @.@ 5 million 2005 USD ) . According to the Taiwan Council of Agriculture , the banana and pear crops were the worst affected .

 Upon making landfall in China , several coastal locations reported winds in excess of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , with wind gusts peaking at 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) . Further inland , winds reached 147 km / h ( 91 mph ) at Shanghai , the highest wind gust on record in the city . The storm produced heavy amounts of rainfall , reaching a maximum of 701 mm ( 27 @.@ 6 in ) at a station in <unk> County . Extreme amounts of precipitation fell in short durations , including 91 mm ( 3 @.@ 6 in ) in just 1 hour and 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) in 3 hours at Dinghai District . Just days after a previous heavy rainfall event , the rainfall from Matsa caused record @-@ breaking river flooding along eight Chinese rivers , including a station at a floodgate on Suzhou Creek which peaked at 4 @.@ 55 m ( 14 @.@ 93 feet ) . 
 In Zhejiang , where Matsa made landfall , high storm tides occurred along the coastline . In some areas , water levels rose quickly , with some coastal homes experiencing flooding from the tide . Rough seas off of Ningbo capsized a fishing boat , leaving its three occupants missing . About two @-@ thirds of the province reported more than 50 mm ( 2 in ) of rainfall , resulting in flooding in low @-@ lying areas as well as several mudslides , one of which killed two people . The combined effects of the winds and rains destroyed 21 reservoirs and more than 200 km ( 120 mi ) of embankment , and damaged several water stations . Matsa damaged 3 @,@ 380 km2 ( 1 @,@ 310 sq mi ) of crops , with around 224 km2 ( 86 sq mi ) of cropland destroyed from the flooding . About 13 @,@ 000 houses were destroyed in the province . Throughout Zhejiang , Matsa caused $ 8 @.@ 9 billion ( 2005 CNY , $ 1 @.@ 1 billion 2005 USD ) in damage and five direct fatalities . 
 Heavy rainfall in Shanghai flooded 84 city streets ; in some locations insufficient water drainage left homes and apartments flooded , with a total of 20 @,@ 000 houses reporting flooding . The flooding also closed the city subway system for a few hours . Strong winds downed 2 @,@ 700 trees and 400 power lines in the city . The typhoon damaged a construction site in the city , leaving three injured and one person killed . Throughout the city an estimated 15 @,@ 000 houses were destroyed . Additionally , four people were electrocuted as a result of the flooding . In Shanghai alone , damage totaled $ 1 @.@ 33 billion ( 2005 CNY , $ 164 @.@ 5 million 2005 USD ) ; seven people died in the city . 
 Despite the anticipated effects , Beijing experienced only light rainfall . Throughout China , over 31 million people were affected in over eight provinces . Typhoon Matsa left the agricultural industry severely impacted , with over 20 @,@ 000 km2 ( 7 @,@ 700 sq mi ) damaged . The combination of its winds and flooding damaged around 200 @,@ 000 buildings , including a total of 59 @,@ 000 destroyed houses .

 Subsequent to the passage of the typhoon in Taiwan , large quantities of mud and impurities entered and polluted the Shihmen Reservoir in Taoyuan County ( now Taoyuan City ) , the county 's primary source of water . Severe cloudiness occurred in the water , and at one time the reservoir recorded 25 @,@ 000 <unk> turbidity units . Such facilities are unable to operate with mud in the water , and in response , the Taiwan Water Corporation established temporary water stations to alleviate the situation , and the <unk> Water Treatment Plant worked to treat the problem . Furthermore , officials drilled wells to accommodate the shortage . Water supply in the southern portion of Taoyuan County was restored by five days after the storm , with supply restored to the northern portion of the county by ten days after the passage of the typhoon . The same problem had occurred previously after Typhoon <unk> in July 2004 . As a result of the crop damage , the Taiwan Council of Agriculture opened its reserve of frozen vegetables to prevent overharvesting of the existing crops . Despite the measures , crop prices reached record levels , which led to groups calling out for the government to stabilize the price of foods . In reaction , a member of the Council of Agriculture remarked that " vegetable prices [ were ] expected to go back to normal gradually ... as supplies increase [ d ] . " The passage of the typhoon left hundreds of residents in Hsinchu County isolated from the outside world for four days . As a result , officials deployed helicopters with rescue supplies and returned with the injured . Aid from one internal organization totaled $ <unk> ( 2005 TWD , $ 9 @,@ 500 2005 USD ) . Shortly after the effects of the typhoon ended on the island , work began to repair and rebuild the impacted bridges and roads . Electricians quickly began restoring power across northern Taiwan ; by the day after the typhoon 's passage , the number of houses without power decreased by 90 % . 
 In the People 's Republic of China , members of the People 's Liberation Army assisted in search and rescue operations . Officials called for about 100 @,@ 000 citizens in Shanghai for work in disaster control and distribution of relief aid , with some providing relief supplies to flooded areas by inflatable rafts . Within a month , Typhoons Talim and <unk> also affected the same area , further compounding the effects of Matsa . During the 38th Session of the World Meteorological Organization in Hanoi , Vietnam , the name Matsa was retired ; during the next session , the name <unk> was nominated as its replacement . 
 = I 'm Just Wild About Harry = 
 " I 'm Just Wild About Harry " is a song written in 1921 with lyrics by Noble Sissle and music by Eubie Blake for the Broadway show Shuffle Along . " I 'm Just Wild About Harry " was the most popular number of the production , which was the first financially successful Broadway play to have African @-@ American writers and an all African @-@ American cast . The song broke what had been a taboo against musical and stage depictions of romantic love between African @-@ Americans . 
 Originally written as a waltz , Blake rewrote the number as a foxtrot at the singer 's request . The result was a simple , direct , joyous , and infectious tune enhanced onstage by improvisational dancing . In 1948 Harry S. Truman selected " I 'm Just Wild About Harry " as his campaign song for the United States presidential election of 1948 . Its success in politics led to a popular revival . 
 = = Background = = 
 Both " I 'm Just Wild About Harry " and the show Shuffle Along broke racial taboos . During the early 20th century African @-@ Americans were excluded from most mainstream theater in the United States : white Vaudeville refused to book more than one African @-@ American act on a bill and for over a decade no Broadway show used African @-@ American performers at all . Blake and Sissle met F. E. Miller and Aubrey Lyles for the first time at a fundraising benefit for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1920 . Vaudeville 's exclusionary practices limited bills to one African @-@ American act per night , so as a result the two leading African @-@ American acting teams knew of each other only by reputation . The four performers agreed that the only feasible way for African @-@ Americans to return to Broadway with dignity would be musical comedy . Miller proposed they collaborate . 
 The resulting show adapted plot and characters from Miller and Aubrey 's Vaudeville comic sketches with music by Blake and Sissle . Although the music of Shuffle Along was new to the public , only three compositions were actually written for the production : " I 'm Just Wild About Harry " , " Bandana Days " , and " Love Will Find A Way " . The other songs used in the show were material that Blake and Sissle had tried unsuccessfully to sell to Tin Pan Alley . " I 'm Just Wild About Harry " and " Love Will Find a Way " in particular were politically risky for the era . 
 " If anything approaching a love duet was introduced in a musical comedy , it had to be broadly <unk> , " recalled black poet and lyricist James Weldon Johnson . " The reason ... lay in the belief that a love scene between two Negroes could not strike a white audience except as ridiculous . " 
 The title and chorus of the musical 's most famous number challenge that taboo : I 'm just wild about Harry and he 's just wild about me is a clear statement of mutual romantic interest . Sissle and Blake risked the public 's rejection by shedding most of the racial stereotypes that had been the norm for theatrical performances . 
 = = Creation = = 
 " I 'm Just Wild About Harry " underwent a complete rewrite during rehearsals and was nearly cut from the show . Blake 's original version of the song was a Viennese waltz , but according to the authors of America 's Songs , performer Lottie Gee encouraged rewriting the number as an up @-@ tempo one @-@ step . Blake disliked the suggestion and feared it would ruin his waltz but capitulated after Sissle agreed with Gee . 
 Audiences did not respond well to the revised version during early performances . Blake was on the verge of dropping the number from the show when a dancer took ill and had to be replaced . The understudy was a singer who did not know the steps , so when he was unable to follow the routine he ignored it and improvised . America 's Songs quotes Sissle 's recollection of how the performance saved the song : " He dropped out of line and with a jive smile and a high @-@ stepping routine of his own , he stopped the show cold . " 
 = = Structure = = 
 Alec Wilder and James T. Maher call " I 'm Just Wild About Harry " a " strong , direct , simple song , the principal device of which is a strong fourth beat tied to the down beat " . The song moves in short melodic bursts characteristic of the era : lighthearted but rhythmic . 
 " It 's of the genre of Hallelujah , Fine and Dandy and all those cut @-@ time theater rhythm songs . It uses a lot of step @-@ wise writing and only one note out of its C @-@ major scale , a d sharp . For a theater song it is not rangy , being only an octave and a third . " 
 The tightly rhymed lyrics comprise a straightforward set of comparisons that border on comic exaggeration . 
 The heavenly <unk> 
 Of his kisses 
 Fill me with ecstasy . 
 He 's sweet just like chocolate candy 
 And just like honey from the bee . 
 Yet Furia and Lasser describe the song 's overall impact as an infectious delight . 
 Within the context of the play , the number occurs early in the second act when the leading lady declares her love for the leading man . Her father is the wealthiest man in town , which poses obstacles to the match . The overall plot concerns a mayoral race in all @-@ black <unk> where two dishonest grocery store owners vie for political office . One of the corrupt grocers wins the race shortly afterward and appoints the other chief of police . Harry leads the community protest that returns the two grocers to their store , and wins the girl .

 Shuffle Along was a significant theatrical success that " ended more than a decade of systematic exclusion of blacks from the Broadway stage " . The show opened in New York City at Daly 's 63rd Street Music Hall on May 23 , 1921 and ran 504 performances . The venue was actually a converted lecture hall that lacked a proper stage or orchestra pit . The show overcame financial straits and a poor location to become " the first all @-@ black musical to enjoy a long run and be treated as more than an oddity . " 
 " On the New York opening night , the audience loved the show . Influential critics like Alan Dale , George Jean Nathan , and Heywood Broun were highly enthusiastic . Gradually Shuffle Along built up a cult status . So big were the crowds that the police had trouble controlling the traffic . Eventually they had to make Sixty @-@ third a one @-@ way street . A black show was back on Broadway , even if 63rd Street , a long way uptown , was barely Broadway ! In Eubie Blake 's words , ' It wasn 't Broadway but we made it Broadway . ' " 
 " I 'm Just Wild About Harry " was the most popular number of the show . Blake conducted the show 's orchestra and recorded the song for the Victor label . Noble Sissle 's 1937 recording for the Victory label altered the original tone considerably in order to showcase the talents of clarinetist Sidney Bechet . Other early recordings include those by Benny Krueger , Louis Mitchell and Paul Whiteman . 
 In 2016 , it returned to Broadway in a revival of Shuffle Along .

 Judy Garland sang the piece as one of several songs in a minstrel show in the M @-@ G @-@ M musical Babes in Arms ( 1939 ) . 
 Alice Faye sang it with Louis Prima 's band in the 1939 film Rose of Washington Square . It was signature tune of Hi Gang ! , a popular BBC Radio comedy show of the early <unk> years , starring the American actors Bebe Daniels and her husband Ben Lyon , who had settled in London , and the British comedian Vic Oliver . In 1946 , Daffy Duck sang a chorus of it in Daffy Doodles . 
 In 1948 " I 'm Just Wild About Harry " underwent a revival when Harry S. Truman selected it as his campaign song for the presidency of the United States . Republicans and some Democrats that year joked , " I 'm just mild about Harry . " The next year Al Jolson performed it in the film Jolson Sings Again and the song became a jazz standard . This return to popularity briefly reunited Blake and Sissle for the first time since 1933 . In 1955 , the song again appeared in the Warner Brothers cartoon short One Froggy Evening as one of the songs sung by Michigan J. Frog during his dance routine . Writing about American popular songs in 1972 , Wilder and Maher call " I 'm Just Wild About Harry " the only enduringly popular song from Shuffle Along . On The Muppet Show , Jean Stapleton performed the song with the mad bomber and <unk> Muppet character , Crazy Harry , who accompanies her singing on his <unk> , which consisted partly of a line of plunger blasting machines wired to set off numerous explosive charges in time with the lyrics .

 Freddy Jose Galvis ( born November 14 , 1989 ) is a Venezuelan Major League Baseball shortstop for the Philadelphia Phillies . Galvis was born in Punto Fijo , Falcón , Venezuela , and played Little League Baseball including the Little League World Series there before being discovered by one of the Phillies ' scouts in the area . At age 16 , he signed a contract with the Phillies despite not receiving much attention from scouts ; he went on to spend the next several years in their minor league system , including a particularly lengthy stint with the Reading Phillies , the Phillies ' Double @-@ A ( AA ) affiliate . In 2012 , he made his major league debut on opening day at second base , substituting for the injured Chase Utley . He became a fan favorite for his performance early in the season , especially on defense , until he sustained an injury , and subsequently was suspended 50 games after a positive test for performance @-@ enhancing drugs . He missed the remainder of the season . Over the course of the next two seasons , he split time between the Lehigh Valley IronPigs – the Phillies ' Triple @-@ A affiliate – and the major league ball club , but struggled to establish himself offensively . Entering 2015 , his future with the club was uncertain , although with the departure of Jimmy Rollins , he was a candidate to be the team 's starting shortstop . 
 Galvis is an outstanding defensive shortstop , capable of making acrobatic plays and utilizing a strong throwing arm . Conversely , he has struggled to establish himself as an effective offensive player , having consistently posted batting averages below .250 at the major league level , which hinders the team 's ability to utilize him regularly . He aspires to emulate fellow Venezuelan Omar Vizquel , his role model .

 Galvis was born November 14 , 1989 , in Punto Fijo , Falcón , Venezuela , and at age 14 , the Philadelphia Phillies began to scout him during his days playing youth baseball . He participated on Latin America 's team in the Little League World Series , but due to his slight stature ( 5 feet 10 inches ( 1 @.@ 78 m ) 154 pounds ( 70 kg ) ) , struggled to captivate scouts ' attention . Galvis said , " They told me that I couldn 't play ( pro ) baseball . But I knew I had the ability . " In 2006 , scouts Sal <unk> and Jesus Mendez signed him during the amateur player signing period ; Galvis , 16 years old , was not a particularly heralded prospect , but did receive some attention from scouting experts before signing with the Phillies .

 Galvis participated in the Florida Instructional League in 2006 . The next season , he officially began affiliated baseball in 2007 with the Williamsport Crosscutters at age 17 , as one of just five players not born in the United States . He made an impression with Phillies ' personnel due to outstanding defensive skills that drew comparisons to those of Baseball Hall of Famer Omar Vizquel , and also demonstrated solid instincts while baserunning , despite struggling to get on base . Concurrently , he hit .203 with nine stolen bases in 38 games . In 2008 , with the Lakewood Blue Claws in the South Atlantic League , Galvis hit .238 with 14 stolen bases in 127 games . He had a particularly strong May , during which he hit .313 with 14 RBIs in May . He also earned placement on the league 's postseason all @-@ star team . He began 2009 with the Clearwater Threshers in Class A @-@ Advanced , and was the Phillies minor league player of the week after he hit .417 from April 20 to 26 . The following May , he fractured his right ring finger , and spent more than two months on the disabled list . Thereafter , he spent seven games with the GCL Phillies before finishing the season at Double @-@ A , where he hit just .197 . 
 Galvis returned to Reading for his 2010 season after earning an invitation to the Phillies ' major league spring training . He led all shortstops in the Eastern League in fielding percentage , assists , putouts , and total chances . He was named an Eastern League all @-@ star . After the season , he played for <unk> del Magallanes in the Venezuelan Winter League . Entering 2011 , he was " was considered major @-@ league @-@ ready defensively but a major liability offensively . " But in 2011 , at age 21 , Galvis had the best season of his career to date . Always known as an excellent defender , but mediocre hitter , he was finally able to improve at the plate , thanks in part to a much more rigorous off @-@ season conditioning regimen , and also due to hitting higher in the batting order , where he was thus challenged to make greater offensive contributions by utilizing a more aggressive approach . He also improved his arm strength to the point that at least defensively , coaches and front office personnel felt he was ready to be a major league shortstop . Starting the year in Double @-@ A ( AA ) with the Reading Phillies , Galvis hit .273 , with 35 RBIs , in 464 plate appearances across 104 games . In August , Galvis was promoted to the Triple @-@ A ( AAA ) Lehigh Valley IronPigs , with whom he hit .321 with nine multi @-@ hit games and 13 runs scored in his first 23 games . He hit in the leadoff spot with Lehigh Valley as well . Overall with Lehigh Valley , he hit .298 , with eight RBIs in 126 plate appearances during 33 games . Between AA and AAA , he combined to hit .278 with eight home runs , 43 RBIs , 78 runs , and 23 stolen bases in 137 games . His excellent numbers were enough to earn the 2011 Paul Owens Award , which is given to the best position player and pitcher , respectively , in the Philadelphia Phillies minor league system . At the end of the 2011 season , Galvis was sent to the Venezuelan Winter League , and despite a brief ganglion cyst injury , played there until December 1 .

 Galvis was disappointed to learn that that Phillies ' shortstop Jimmy Rollins had re @-@ signed with the Phillies during offseason preceding 2012 , as Galvis had hoped to replace him . He said that he allowed himself to pout for two hours , and then moved on . With Rollins re @-@ signing with the Phillies , Galvis thought he was headed back to the minor leagues . He entered spring training as the " one of the most intriguing story lines " for the Phillies , and led the team in several statistical categories , but still presumed to open the season in AAA . However , on March 19 , 2012 , Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro , Jr. announced that Chase Utley would miss the beginning of the season due to a knee injury , and Galvis would be the opening day starter there . 
 Galvis became the first Phillies ' player to make his major league debut on opening day in 42 years when he did so on April 5 . In his debut , he hit into two double plays . Galvis recorded his first major league hit in his fourth career game on April 9 , a two @-@ run double off of Miami Marlins pitcher Aníbal Sánchez . Four days later , he hit his first major league home run off of R.A. Dickey in a game against the New York Mets . After spending two months as the Phillies ' starting second baseman , Galvis injured his back on June 8 ; the injury was initially thought to be a lower back strain , but eventually diagnosed as a Pars fracture in his back . He was placed on the disabled list shortly thereafter . By that time , he had " won the hearts of fans and earned the confidence of his manager ... with dazzling defense . " While on the disabled list , Galvis tested positive for having a metabolite of <unk> in his system , a violation of Major League Baseball 's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program . Galvis denied any wrongdoing , commenting , " I cannot understand how even this tiny particle of a banned substance got into my body . I have not and never would knowingly use anything illegal to enhance my performance . " He did not play for the remainder of the Phillies ' 2012 season . 
 There was considerable debate as to whether Galvis should open the 2013 season working on his hitting in AAA , or on the bench of the major league Phillies . Manager Charlie Manuel preferred the latter , commenting that even in 300 major league at bats splitting time between second base , shortstop , and third base , Galvis could make a greater contribution than in a season in the minor leagues . Ultimately , he did make the opening day roster , but struggled through the first third of the season , and was optioned to AAA on June 27 . Correspondingly , the Phillies acquired veteran infielder John McDonald . He performed better in AAA , including a 40 @-@ game streak during which he did not commit any errors , and a leadoff home run on the Fourth of July . He returned to the major league Phillies as a September callup , and on September 7 , 2013 , he compiled four hits including a game @-@ winning home run against the Atlanta Braves . Overall , 19 at second base , 14 at third base , 10 in left field , and six at shortstop comprised his 49 total major league starts . At the major league level , he hit .234 with six home runs and 19 RBIs , and in AAA , he hit .245 with three home runs and 25 RBIs . 
 Galvis opened the 2014 season with a health scare . During spring training , Galvis contracted a methicillin @-@ resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection ( more commonly known as MRSA ) , ostensibly from the Phillies ' clubhouse at Bright House Field in Clearwater , Florida . " The team 's most versatile and best defensive player " , Galvis returned to the major league club on April 11 . After he struggled early in the season , the Phillies optioned him to AAA on May 9 in favor of Reid Brignac . Two days later , he broke his clavicle , and spent two months on the disabled list . After a rehabilitation assignment , he performed well at AAA , and earned a call @-@ up to the major leagues , replacing Brignac , whom the Phillies designated for assignment . Overall , Galvis posted his worst offensive season thus far ; he hit .176 at the major league level with four home runs and 12 RBIs . After the season , Michael Baumann of Crashburn Alley wrote , " After two years of medical and developmental setbacks , Galvis is still only entering his age @-@ 25 season , so it 's possible the bat develops from bad to below @-@ average and Galvis turns into something . I wouldn ’ t count on it , but it 's still within the realm of possibility . " 
 When the Phillies traded Rollins to the Los Angeles Dodgers prior to the 2015 season , media reports speculated that Galvis and César Hernández were the presumptive nominees to start at shortstop for the upcoming season , likely seeking to bridge the gap between Rollins and J.P. Crawford , the top prospect in the Phillies ' organization . 
 = = Player profile = = 
 Galvis is a slap hitter who , throughout his major league career , has struggled to assert himself as a competent offensive player . Generally , he seeks to drive the ball in the center of the field , and has shortened his stroke . He has very little ability as a power hitter , but he has hit several home runs in key situations throughout his career , an anomaly that confounded Baumann , who noted that Galvis 's inability " to force his way into the lineup by this point has probably scuttled any chance Galvis has of being the Phillies ’ starting shortstop of the future . " Despite his offensive struggles , Phillies staff and media have long recognized Galvis 's strong defensive skills , noting his propensity to make acrobatic and athletic plays , as well as utilize a strong throwing arm . He aspires to emulate Omar Vizquel , his role model . Sam <unk> , a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer , noted that " there are similarities between Galvis and his idol . Both were signed at 16 , both are switch @-@ hitters , both struggled to hit pitching at any level in their early minor league seasons . " Cognizant that he is a smaller player , Galvis has spent significant time working to improve his physical strength and conditioning in the offseasons . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Galvis struggled off the field after his injury in 2012 , noting that he only emerged from the covers of his bed to answer the door for takeout food , namely Chinese food , pizza , and <unk> . Since then , he has started a daily therapeutic routine aimed at preventing future injuries , to which he is apparently susceptible after his first back injury . His hobbies include relaxing at the beach and playing basketball . Galvis married his wife , Anna , in 2013 , and is the father of a girl named Anastasia .

 = Music hall = 
 Music hall is a type of British theatrical entertainment that was popular from the early Victorian era circa 1850 and lasting until 1960 . It involved a mixture of popular songs , comedy , speciality acts , and variety entertainment . The term is derived from a type of theatre or venue in which such entertainment took place . British music hall was similar to American vaudeville , featuring rousing songs and comic acts , while in the United Kingdom the term " vaudeville " ' referred to more working @-@ class types of entertainment that would have been termed " burlesque " in America . 
 Originating in saloon bars within public houses during the 1830s , music hall entertainment became increasingly popular with audiences , so much so , that during the 1850s , the public houses were demolished and specialized music hall theatres developed in their place . These theatres were designed chiefly so people could consume food and alcohol and smoke tobacco in the auditorium while the entertainment took place . This differed somewhat from the conventional type of theatre , which until then seated the audience in stalls with a separate bar @-@ room . Major music halls , were based around London and included Early music halls like the Canterbury Music Hall in Lambeth , Wilton 's Music Hall in Tower Hamlets , and The Middlesex , in Drury Lane , otherwise known as the Old Mo . 
 By the mid @-@ 19th century , the halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs . As a result , professional songwriters were enlisted to provide the music for a plethora of star performers , such as Marie Lloyd , Dan Leno , Little Tich , and George Leybourne . Music hall did not adopt its own unique style . Instead all forms of entertainment were performed : male and female impersonators , lions comiques , mime artists and impressionists , trampoline acts , and comic pianists such as John Orlando Parry and George Grossmith were just a few of the many types of entertainments the audiences could expect to find over the next forty years . 
 Music halls in London were the scene of important industrial conflict in 1907 with a dispute between artists and stage hands on the one hand and theatre managers on the other , which ended in a strike . The halls had recovered by the start of the First World War and were used to stage charity events in aid of the war effort . Music hall entertainment continued after the war , but became less popular due to upcoming Jazz , Swing , and Big Band dance music acts . Licensing restrictions had also changed , and drinking was banned from the auditorium . A new type of music hall entertainment had arrived , in the form of variety , and many music hall performers failed to make the transition . Deemed old fashioned and with the closure of many halls , music hall entertainment ceased and the modern day variety began . 
 = = Origins and development = = 
 Music hall in London had its origins in entertainment provided in the new style saloon bars of public houses during the 1830s . These venues replaced earlier semi @-@ rural amusements provided by fairs and suburban pleasure gardens such as Vauxhall Gardens and the Cremorne Gardens . These latter became subject to urban development and became fewer and less popular . 
 The saloon was a room where for an admission fee or a greater price at the bar , singing , dancing , drama or comedy was performed . The most famous London saloon of the early days was the Grecian Saloon , established in 1825 , at The Eagle ( a former tea @-@ garden ) , 2 Shepherdess Walk , off the City Road in east London . According to John Hollingshead , proprietor of the Gaiety Theatre , London ( originally the Strand Music Hall ) , this establishment was " the father and mother , the dry and wet nurse of the Music Hall " . Later known as the Grecian Theatre , it was here that Marie Lloyd made her début at the age of 14 in 1884 . It is still famous because of an English nursery rhyme , with the somewhat mysterious lyrics : 
 Up and down the City Road 
 In and out The Eagle 
 That 's the way the money <unk> goes the weasel . 
 Another famous " song and supper " room of this period was Evans Music @-@ and @-@ Supper Rooms , 43 King Street , Covent Garden , established in the 1840s by W.H. Evans . This venue was also known as ' Evans Late Joys ' – Joy being the name of the previous owner . Other song and supper rooms included the Coal Hole in The Strand , the <unk> Cellars in Maiden Lane , Covent Garden and the Mogul Saloon in Drury Lane . 
 The music hall as we know it developed from such establishments during the 1850s and were built in and on the grounds of public houses . Such establishments were distinguished from theatres by the fact that in a music hall you would be seated at a table in the auditorium and could drink alcohol and smoke tobacco whilst watching the show . In a theatre , by contrast , the audience was seated in stalls and there was a separate bar @-@ room . An exception to this rule was the Britannia Theatre , Hoxton ( 1841 ) which somehow managed to evade this regulation and served drinks to its customers . Though a theatre rather than a music hall , this establishment later hosted music hall variety acts . 
 = = = Early music halls = = = 
 The establishment often regarded as the first true music hall was the Canterbury , 143 Westminster Bridge Road , Lambeth built by Charles Morton , afterwards dubbed " the Father of the Halls " , on the site of a skittle alley next to his pub , the Canterbury Tavern . It opened on 17 May 1852 and was described by the musician and author Benny Green as being " the most significant date in all the history of music hall " . The hall looked like most contemporary pub concert rooms , but its replacement in 1854 was of then unprecedented size . It was further extended in 1859 , later rebuilt as a variety theatre and finally destroyed by bombing in 1942 . 
 Another early music hall was The Middlesex , Drury Lane ( 1851 ) . Popularly known as the ' Old Mo ' , it was built on the site of the Mogul Saloon . Later converted into a theatre it was demolished in 1965 . The New London Theatre stands on its site . 
 Several large music halls were built in the East End . These included the London Music Hall , otherwise known as The Shoreditch Empire , 95 – 99 Shoreditch High Street , ( 1856 – 1935 ) . This theatre was rebuilt during 1894 by Frank Matcham , the architect of the Hackney Empire . Another in this area was the Royal Cambridge Music Hall , 136 Commercial Street ( 1864 – 1936 ) . Designed by William Finch Hill ( the designer of the Britannia theatre in nearby Hoxton ) , it was rebuilt after a fire in 1898 . 
 The construction of Weston 's Music Hall , High Holborn ( 1857 ) , built up on the site of the Six Cans and Punch Bowl Tavern by the licensed victualler of the premises , Henry Weston , signalled that the West End was fruitful territory for the music hall . During 1906 it was rebuilt as a variety theatre and renamed as the Holborn Empire . It was closed as a result of enemy action in the Blitz on the night of 11 – 12 May 1941 and the building was pulled down in 1960 . Significant West End music halls include : 
 The Oxford Music Hall , 14 / 16 Oxford Street ( 1861 ) – built on the site of an old coaching inn called the Boar and Castle by Charles Morton , the pioneer music hall developer of The Canterbury , who with this development brought music hall to the West End . Demolished in 1926 . 
 The London Pavilion ( 1861 ) . Facade of 1885 rebuild still extant . 
 The Alhambra , Leicester Square ( 1860 ) , in the former premises of the London Panopticon . This sophisticated venue was noted for its alluring corps de ballet and was a focal point for West End pleasure seekers . It was demolished in 1936 . 
 Other large suburban music halls included : 
 The Old Bedford , 93 – 95 High Street , Camden Town ( 1861 ) . Built on the site of the tea gardens of a pub called the Bedford Arms . The Bedford was a favourite haunt of the artists known as the Camden Town Group headed by Walter Sickert who featured interior scenes of music halls in his paintings , including one entitled ' Little Dot Hetherington at The Old Bedford ' . The Old Bedford was demolished in 1969 . 
 Collins ' , Islington Green ( 1862 ) . Opened by Sam Collins , in 1862 , as the Lansdowne Music Hall , converting the pre @-@ existing Lansdowne Arms public house , it was renamed as Collins ' Music Hall in 1863 . It was colloquially known as ' The Chapel on the Green ' . Collins was a star of his own theatre , singing mostly Irish songs specially composed for him . It closed in 1956 , after a fire , but the street front of the building still survives ( see below ) . 
 Deacons in Clerkenwell ( 1862 ) . 
 A noted music hall entrepreneur of this time was Carlo Gatti who built a music hall , known as Gatti 's , at Hungerford Market in 1857 . He sold the music hall to South Eastern Railway in 1862 , and the site became Charing Cross railway station . With the proceeds from selling his first music hall , Gatti acquired a restaurant in Westminster Bridge Road , opposite The Canterbury music hall . He converted the restaurant into a second Gatti 's music hall , known as " Gatti 's @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Road " , in 1865 . It later became a cinema . The building was badly damaged in the Second World War , and was demolished in 1950 . In 1867 , he acquired a public house in Villiers Street named " The Arches " , under the arches of the elevated railway line leading to Charing Cross station . He opened it as another music hall , known as " Gatti 's @-@ in @-@ The @-@ Arches " . After his death his family continued to operate the music hall , known for a period as the Hungerford or Gatti 's Hungerford Palace of Varieties . 
 It became a cinema in 1910 , and the Players ' Theatre in 1946 . 
 By 1865 , there were 32 music halls in London seating between 500 to 5 @,@ 000 people plus an unknown , but large , number of smaller venues . 
 In 1878 , numbers peaked , with 78 large music halls in the metropolis and 300 smaller venues . Thereafter numbers declined due to stricter licensing restrictions imposed by the Metropolitan Board of Works and LCC , and because of commercial competition between popular large suburban halls and the smaller venues , which put the latter out of business . 
 = = = Variety theatre = = = 
 A new era of variety theatre was developed by the rebuilding of the London Pavilion in 1885 . Contemporary accounts noted : 
 Hitherto the halls had borne unmistakeable evidence of their origins , but the last vestiges of their old connections were now thrown aside , and they emerged in all the splendour of their new @-@ born glory . The highest efforts of the architect , the designer and the decorator were enlisted in their service , and the gaudy and tawdry music hall of the past gave way to the resplendent " theatre of varieties " of the present day , with its classic exterior of marble and freestone , its lavishly appointed auditorium and its elegant and luxurious <unk> and promenades brilliantly illuminated by myriad electric lights 
 One of the most famous of these new palaces of pleasure in the West End was the Empire , Leicester Square , built as a theatre in 1884 but acquiring a music hall licence in 1887 . Like the nearby Alhambra this theatre appealed to the men of leisure by featuring alluring ballet dancers and had a notorious promenade which was the resort of courtesans . Another spectacular example of the new variety theatre was the Tivoli in the Strand built 1888 – 90 in an eclectic neo @-@ Romanesque style with Baroque and Moorish @-@ Indian embellishments . " The Tivoli " became a brand name for music @-@ halls all over the British Empire . During 1892 , the Royal English Opera House , which had been a financial failure in Shaftesbury Avenue , applied for a music hall licence and was converted by Walter Emden into a grand music hall and renamed the Palace Theatre of Varieties , managed by Charles Morton . Denied by the newly created LCC permission to construct the promenade , which was such a popular feature of the Empire and Alhambra , the Palace compensated in the way of adult entertainment by featuring apparently nude women in tableaux vivants , though the concerned LCC hastened to reassure patrons that the girls who featured in these displays were actually wearing flesh @-@ toned body stockings and were not naked at all . 
 One of the grandest of these new halls was the Coliseum Theatre built by Oswald Stoll in 1904 at the bottom of St. Martin 's Lane . This was followed by the London Palladium ( 1910 ) in Little Argyll Street . 
 Both were designed by the prolific Frank Matcham . As music hall grew in popularity and respectability , and as the licensing authorities exercised ever firmer regulation , the original arrangement of a large hall with tables at which drink was served , changed to that of a drink @-@ free auditorium . The acceptance of music hall as a legitimate cultural form was established by the first Royal Variety Performance before King George V during 1912 at the Palace Theatre . However , consistent with this new respectability the best @-@ known music hall entertainer of the time , Marie Lloyd , was not invited , being deemed too " saucy " for presentation to the monarchy . 
 = = = ' Music Hall War ' of 1907 = = = 
 The development of syndicates controlling a number of theatres , such as the Stoll circuit , increased tensions between employees and employers . On 22 January 1907 , a dispute between artists , stage hands and managers of the Holborn Empire worsened . Strikes in other London and suburban halls followed , organised by the Variety Artistes ' Federation . The strike lasted for almost two weeks and was known as the Music Hall War . It became extremely well known , and was advocated enthusiastically by the main spokesmen of the trade union and Labour movement – Ben Tillett and Keir Hardie for example . Picket lines were organized outside the theatres by the artistes , while in the provinces theatre management attempted to oblige artistes to sign a document promising never to join a trade union . 
 The strike ended in arbitration , which satisfied most of the main demands , including a minimum wage and maximum working week for musicians . 
 Several music hall entertainers such as Marie <unk> , Marie Lloyd , Arthur Roberts , Joe Elvin and Gus Elen were strong advocates of the strike , though they themselves earned enough not to be concerned personally in a material sense . Lloyd explained her advocacy : 
 We ( the stars ) can dictate our own terms . We are fighting not for ourselves , but for the poorer members of the profession , earning thirty shillings to £ 3 a week . For this they have to do double turns , and now <unk> have been added as well . These poor things have been compelled to submit to unfair terms of employment , and I mean to back up the federation in whatever steps are taken . 
 The pressure for greater rewards for music hall songwriters resulted in the application of copyright law to musical compositions . This in turn increased the profitability of the music publication industry , and the sale of music in printed form . The music publishers at the time ( Feldman , Francis and Day ... ) were large , extremely profitable companies . They sold the right to sing songs to particular artists , and no other person had the right to sing the songs in public . 
 = = = Recruiting = = = 
 World War I may have been the high @-@ water mark of music hall popularity . The artists and composers threw themselves into rallying public support and enthusiasm for the war effort . Patriotic music hall compositions such as " Keep the Home Fires Burning " ( 1914 ) , " Pack up Your Troubles " ( 1915 ) , " It 's a Long Way to Tipperary " ( 1914 ) and " We Don 't Want to Lose You ( but we think you ought to Go ) " , were sung by music hall audiences , and sometimes by soldiers in the trenches . 
 Many songs promoted recruitment ( " All the boys in khaki get the nice girls " , 1915 ) ; others satirised particular elements of the war experience . " What did you do in the Great war , Daddy " ( 1919 ) criticised profiteers and <unk> ; Vesta Tilley 's " I 've got a bit of a blighty one " ( 1916 ) showed a soldier delighted to have a wound just serious enough to be sent home . The rhymes give a sense of grim humour ( When they wipe my face with sponges / and they feed me on <unk> / I 'm glad I 've got a bit of a blighty one ) . 
 Tilley became more popular than ever during this time , when she and her husband , Walter de <unk> , managed a military recruitment drive . In the guise of characters like ' Tommy in the Trench ' and ' Jack Tar Home from Sea ' , Tilley performed songs such as " The army of today 's all right " and " Jolly Good Luck to the Girl who Loves a Soldier " . This is how she got the nickname Britain 's best recruiting sergeant – young men were sometimes asked to join the army on stage during her show . She also performed in hospitals and sold war bonds . Her husband was knighted in 1919 for his own services to the war effort , and Tilley became Lady de <unk> . 
 Once the reality of war began to sink home , the recruiting songs all but disappeared – the Greatest Hits collection for 1915 published by top music publisher Francis and Day contains no recruitment songs . After conscription was brought in 1916 , songs dealing with the war spoke mostly of the desire to return home . Many also expressed anxiety about the new roles women were taking in society ; 
 Possibly the most notorious of music hall songs from the First World War was " Oh ! It 's a lovely war " ( 1917 ) , popularised by male impersonator Ella Shields . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 Music hall continued during the interwar period , but no longer as the single dominant form of popular entertainment in Britain . The improvement of cinema , the development of radio , and the cheapening of the gramophone damaged its popularity greatly . It now had to compete with jazz , swing and big band dance music . Licensing restrictions also changed its character . 
 In 1914 , the London County Council ( LCC ) enacted that drinking be banished from the auditorium into a separate bar and during 1923 even the separate bar was abolished by parliamentary decree . The exemption of the theatres from this latter act prompted some critics to denounce this legislation as an attempt to deprive the working classes of their pleasures , as a form of social control , whilst sparing the supposedly more responsible upper classes who patronised the theatres ( though this could be due to the licensing restrictions brought about due to the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 , which also applied to public houses as well ) . Even so , the music hall gave rise to such major stars as George Formby , Gracie Fields , Max Miller , Will Hay , and Flanagan and Allen during this period . 
 In the early 1950s , rock and roll , whose performers initially topped music hall bills , attracted a young audience who had little interest in the music hall acts while driving the older audience away . The final demise was competition from television , which grew very popular after the Queen 's coronation was televised . Some music halls tried to retain an audience by putting on striptease acts . In 1957 , the playwright John Osborne delivered this elegy : 
 The music hall is dying , and with it , a significant part of England . Some of the heart of England has gone ; something that once belonged to everyone , for this was truly a folk art . 
 Moss Empires , the largest British Music Hall chain , closed the majority of its theatres in 1960 , closely followed by the death of music hall stalwart Max Miller in 1963 , prompting one contemporary to write that : " Music @-@ halls ... died this afternoon when they buried Max Miller " . Miller himself had sometimes said that the genre would die with him . Many music hall performers , unable to find work , fell into poverty ; some did not even have a home , having spent their working lives living in digs between performances . 
 Stage and film musicals , however , continued to be influenced by the music hall idiom , including Oliver ! , Dr Dolittle and My Fair Lady . The BBC series The Good Old Days , which ran for thirty years , recreated the music hall for the modern audience , and the Paul Daniels Magic Show allowed several speciality acts a television presence from 1979 to 1994 . Aimed at a younger audience , but still owing a lot to the music hall heritage , was the late ' 70s series The Muppet Show . 
 = = Music halls of Paris = = 
 The music hall was first imported into France in its British form in 1862 , but under the French law protecting the state theatres , performers could not wear costumes or recite dialogue , something only allowed in theaters .. When the law changed in 1867 , the Paris music hall flourished , and a half @-@ dozen new halls opened , offering acrobats , singers , dancers , magicians , and trained animals . The first Paris music call built specially for that purpose was the Folies @-@ <unk> ( 1869 ) ; it was followed by the Moulin Rouge ( 1889 ) , the Alhambra ( 1866 ) , the first to be called a music hall , and the Olympia ( 1893 ) . The <unk> ( 1903 ) was a music @-@ garden , open only in summer , with a theater , restaurant , circus , and horse @-@ racing . Older theaters also transformed themselves into music halls , including the <unk> Music Hall ( 1873 ) , the Bataclan ( 1864 ) , and the Alcazar ( 1858 ) . At the beginning , music halls offered dance reviews , theater and songs , but gradually songs and singers became the main attraction . 
 Paris music halls all faced stiff competition in the interwar period from the most popular new form of entertainment , the cinema . They responded by offering more complex and lavish shows . In 1911 , the Olympia had introduced the giant stairway as a set for its productions , an idea copied by other music halls . The singer Mistinguett made her debut the Casino de Paris in 1895 and continued to appear regularly in the 1920s and 1930s at the Folies Bergère , Moulin Rouge and Eldorado . Her risqué routines captivated Paris , and she became one of the most highly @-@ paid and popular French entertainers of her time . 
 One of the most popular entertainers in Paris during the period was the American singer Josephine Baker . Baker sailed to Paris , France . She first arrived in Paris in 1925 to perform in a show called " La Revue <unk> " at the Théâtre des Champs @-@ Élysées . She became an immediate success for her erotic dancing , and for appearing practically nude on stage . After a successful tour of Europe , she returned to France to star at the Folies Bergère . Baker performed the ' Danse sauvage , ' wearing a costume consisting of a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas . 
 The music @-@ halls suffered growing hardships in the 1930s . The Olympia was converted into a movie theater , and others closed . Others continued to thrive . In 1937 and 1930 , the Casino de Paris presented shows with Maurice Chevalier , who had already achieved success as an actor and singer in Hollywood . 
 In 1935 , a twenty @-@ year old singer named Édith Piaf was discovered in the <unk> by nightclub owner Louis Leplée , whose club Le <unk> , off the Champs @-@ Élysées , was frequented by the upper and lower classes alike . He persuaded her to sing despite her extreme nervousness . Leplée taught her the basics of stage presence and told her to wear a black dress , which became her trademark apparel . Leplée ran an intense publicity campaign leading up to her opening night , attracting the presence of many celebrities , including Maurice Chevalier . Her nightclub appearance led to her first two records produced that same year , and the beginning of a legendary career . 
 Competition from movies and television largely brought an end to the Paris music hall . However , a few still flourish , with tourists as their primary audience . Major music halls include the Folies @-@ <unk> , Crazy Horse Saloon , Casino de Paris , Olympia , and Moulin Rouge . 
 = = History of the songs = = 
 The musical forms most associated with music hall evolved in part from traditional folk song and songs written for popular drama , becoming by the 1850s a distinct musical style . Subject matter became more contemporary and humorous , and accompaniment was provided by larger house @-@ orchestras as increasing affluence gave the lower classes more access to commercial entertainment and to a wider range of musical instruments , including the piano . The consequent change in musical taste from traditional to more professional forms of entertainment arose in response to the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation of previously rural populations during the Industrial Revolution . The newly created urban communities , cut off from their cultural roots , required new and readily accessible forms of entertainment . 
 Music halls were originally tavern rooms which provided entertainment , in the form of music and speciality acts , for their patrons . By the middle years of the nineteenth century , the first purpose @-@ built music halls were being built in London . The halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs that could no longer be met from the traditional folk song repertoire . Professional songwriters were enlisted to fill the gap . 
 The emergence of a distinct music hall style can be credited to a fusion of musical influences . Music hall songs needed to gain and hold the attention of an often jaded and unruly urban audience . In America , from the 1840s , Stephen Foster had reinvigorated folk song with the admixture of Negro spiritual to produce a new type of popular song . Songs like " Old Folks at Home " ( 1851 ) and " Oh , Dem Golden Slippers " ( James Bland , 1879 ) spread round the globe , taking with them the idiom and appurtenances of the minstrel song . Other influences on the rapidly developing music hall idiom were Irish and European music , particularly the jig , polka , and waltz . 
 Typically , a music hall song consists of a series of verses sung by the performer alone , and a repeated chorus which carries the principal melody , and in which the audience is encouraged to join . 
 In Britain , the first music hall songs often promoted the alcoholic wares of the owners of the halls in which they were performed . Songs like " Glorious Beer " , and the first major music hall success , Champagne Charlie ( 1867 ) had a major influence in establishing the new art form . The tune of " Champagne Charlie " became used for the Salvation Army hymn " Bless His Name , He Sets Me Free " ( 1881 ) . When asked why the tune should be used like this , William Booth is said to have replied " Why should the devil have all the good tunes ? " The people the Army sought to save , knew nothing of the hymn tunes or gospel melodies used in the churches , but ' the music hall had been their melody school . ' " 
 By the 1870s , the songs were free of their folk music origins , and particular songs also started to become associated with particular singers , often with exclusive contracts with the songwriter , just as many pop songs are today . Towards the end of the style the music became influenced by ragtime and jazz , before being overtaken by them . 
 Music hall songs were often composed with their working class audiences in mind . Songs like My Old Man ( Said Follow the Van ) , Knocked ' em in the Old Kent Road , and Waiting at the Church , expressed in melodic form situations with which the urban poor were very familiar . Music hall songs could be romantic , patriotic , humorous or sentimental , as the need arose . The most popular music hall songs became the basis for the pub songs of the typical Cockney " knees up " . 
 Although a number of songs show a sharply ironic and knowing view of working class life , no doubt a larger number were repetitive , derivative , written quickly and sung to make a living rather than a work of art .

 = = Music hall comedy = = 
 The typical music hall comedian was a man or woman , usually dressed in character to suit the subject of the song , or sometimes attired in absurd and eccentric style . Until well into the twentieth century , the acts were essentially vocal , with songs telling a story , accompanied by a minimum of patter . They included a variety of genres , including : 
 Lion comiques : essentially , men dressed as " toffs " , who sang songs about drinking champagne , going to the races , going to the ball , womanising and gambling , and living the life of an aristocrat . 
 Male and female impersonators , perhaps more in the style of a pantomime dame than a modern drag queen . Nevertheless , these included some more sophisticated performers such as Vesta Tilley , whose male impersonations communicated real social commentary . 
 = = Speciality acts = = 
 The vocal content of the music hall bills , was , from the beginning , accompanied by many other kinds of act , some of them quite weird and wonderful . These were known collectively as speciality acts ( abbreviated to " <unk> " ) , which , over time , have included : 
 Aerial acts , of the sort usually seen at the circus 
 Adagio : essentially a sort of cross between a dance act and a juggling act , consisting usually of a male dancer who threw a slim , pretty young girl around . Some aspects of modern dance choreography evolved from Adagio acts . 
 Magic acts and <unk> , such as Harry Houdini . 
 Cycling acts : again , a development of a circus act , consisting of either a solo or a troupe of trick cyclists . There was even seven @-@ piece a cycling band called Seven Musical <unk> , who played fifty instruments between them , and Kaufmann 's Cycling Beauties , a troupe of girls in Victorian swim wear . 
 <unk> , or Vent acts as they were called in the business . 
 Electric acts , using the newly discovered phenomenon of static electricity to produce tricks such as lighting gas jets and setting fire to handkerchiefs through the performers fingertips . 
 Drag artists . Female entertainers dressed as men , such as Vesta Tilley . Or male entertainers dressed as women , such as impressionist , Danny La Rue , or comedian , Rex Jameson , in the character of Mrs <unk> . 
 Knife throwing and sword swallowing . The most spectacular of its time was the <unk> Troupe , who swallowed a sword fired from a rifle . 
 Juggling and plate spinning acts . Another variation was the <unk> . 
 Feats of strength by both strongmen and <unk> . 
 Fire eaters and other eating acts , such as eating glass , razor blades , goldfish etc . 
 Wrestling and jujitsu exhibitions were both popular speciality acts , forming the basis of modern professional wrestling . 
 <unk> acts . Commonly a male mentalist , blindfolded on stage , and an attractive female assistant passing among the audience . The assistant would collect objects from the audience , and the mentalist would identify each by " reading " the assistants mind . This was usually accomplished by a clever system of codes and clues from the assistant . 
 Mime artists and impressionists . 
 Trampoline acts . 
 Animal acts : Talking dogs , flea circuses , and all manner of animals doing tricks . 
 Stilt walkers . 
 Puppet acts , including human puppets and living doll acts . 
 Comic pianists , such as John Orlando Parry and George Grossmith . 
 Cowboy / Wild West acts . 
 Shadow puppet acts .

 The music hall has been evoked in many films , plays , TV series , and books . 
 About half of the film Those Were the Days ( 1934 ) is set in a music hall . It was based on a farce by Pinero and features the music hall acts of Lily Morris , Harry Bedford , the gymnasts Gaston & Andre , G. H. Elliott , Sam Curtis and Frank Boston & Betty . 
 A music hall with a ' memory man ' act provides a pivotal plot device in the classic 1935 Alfred Hitchcock thriller The 39 Steps . 
 The Arthur Askey comedy film I Thank You ( 1941 ) features old @-@ time music hall star Lily Morris as an ex @-@ music hall artiste now ennobled as " Lady Randall " . In the last scene of the film , however , she reverts to type and gives a rendition of " Waiting at the Church " at an impromptu concert at Aldwych tube station organised by Askey and his side @-@ kick Richard " <unk> " Murdoch . 
 The Victorian era of music hall was celebrated by the 1944 film , Champagne Charlie . 
 The comedy of Benny Hill , first seen on British television in 1951 , was heavily influenced by the traditions and conventions of Music hall comedy and he actively kept those traditions ( comedy , songs , patter , pantomime , and female impersonations ) alive on his more than 100 television specials broadcast from 1955 through 1991 . 
 Charlie Chaplin 's 1952 film Limelight , set in 1914 London , evokes the music hall world of Chaplin 's youth where he performed as comedian before he achieved worldwide celebrity as a film star in America . The film depicts the last performance of a washed @-@ up music hall clown called <unk> at The Empire theatre , Leicester Square . The film premiered at the Empire Cinema , which was built on the same site as the Empire theatre . 
 The Good Old Days ( 1953 to 1983 ) was a popular BBC television light entertainment programme recorded live at the Leeds City Varieties which recreated an authentic atmosphere of the Victorian – Edwardian music hall with songs and sketches of the era performed by present @-@ day performers in the style of the original artistes . The audience dressed in period costume and joined in the singing , especially the singing of Down at the Old Bull and Bush which closed the show . The show was compered by Leonard Sachs who introduced the acts . In the course of its run , it featured about 2000 artists . The show was first broadcast on 20 July 1953 . The Good Old Days was inspired by the success of the Ridgeway 's Late Joys at the Players ' Theatre Club in London : a private members ' club that ran fortnightly programmes of variety acts in London 's West End . 
 John Osborne 's play The Entertainer ( 1957 ) portrays the life and work of a failing third @-@ rate music hall stage performer who tries to keep his career going even as his personal life falls apart . The story is set at the time of the Suez Crisis in 1956 , against the backdrop of the dying music hall tradition , and has been seen as symbolic of Britain 's general post @-@ war decline , its loss of its Empire , its power , and its cultural confidence and identity . It was made into a film in 1960 starring Laurence Olivier in the title role of Archie Rice . 
 In Grip of the Strangler ( 1958 ) , set in Victorian London , the raunchy can @-@ can dancers and loose women of the sleazy " Judas Hole " music hall are terrorised by the Haymarket Strangler , played by Boris Karloff . 
 J. B. Priestley 's 1965 novel Lost Empires also evokes the world of Edwardian music hall just before the start of World War I ; the title is a reference to the Empire theatres ( as well as foreshadowing the decline of the British Empire itself ) . It was recently adapted as a television miniseries , shown in both the UK and in the U.S. as a PBS presentation . Priestley 's 1929 novel The Good Companions , set in the same period , follows the lives of the members of a " concert party " or touring Pierrot troupe . 
 The parodic film Oh ! What a Lovely War ( 1969 ) , based on the stage musical Oh , What a Lovely War ! ( 1963 ) by Joan Littlewood 's Theatre Workshop , featured the music hall turns and songs that had provided support for the British war effort in World War I. 
 The popular British television series Upstairs , Downstairs ( 1971 – 1975 ) and its spin @-@ off Thomas & Sarah ( 1979 ) each dealt frequently with the world of the Edwardian music hall , sometimes through references to actual Edwardian era performers such as Vesta Tilley or to characters on the show attending performances , and other times through the experiences of the popular character Sarah Moffat , who left domestic service several times and often ended up going on stage to support herself when she did . 
 Between 1978 and 1984 , BBC television broadcast two series of programmes called The Old Boy Network . These featured a star ( usually a music hall performer , but also some younger turns like Eric Sykes ) performing some of their best known routines while giving a slide show of their life story . Artistes featured included Arthur Askey , Tommy Trinder , Sandy Powell , and Chesney Allen . 
 The modern Players ' Theatre Club provides a brief impression of contemporary music hall in the film The Fourth Angel , where Jeremy Irons ' character creates an alibi by visiting a show . 
 Sarah Waters 's book Tipping the Velvet ( 1998 ) revolves around the world of music halls in the late Victorian era , and in particular around two fictional " <unk> " ( drag kings ) named Kitty Butler and Nan King . 
 Music hall had a profound influence on The Beatles through Paul McCartney , who is himself the son of a music hall performer ( Jim McCartney , who led Jim Mac 's Jazz Band ) . Many of McCartney 's songs are indistinguishable from music hall except in some of their instrumentation . " When I 'm Sixty @-@ Four " and " Honey Pie " are two examples , as are " Your Mother Should Know " and " Maxwell 's Silver Hammer " . 
 Herman 's Hermits , led by Peter Noone , also incorporated music hall into their repertoire , scoring a major hit with their cover of the Harry Champion music hall standard , " I 'm Henery the Eighth , I Am " , in 1965 ( but Noone 's version included only the chorus , not the many verses of the original ) . 
 In James Joyce 's short story The Boarding House , Mrs. Mooney 's boarding @-@ house in Hardwicke Street accommodates " occasionally ( ... ) artistes from the music halls " . The Sunday night " reunions " with Jack Mooney in the drawing @-@ room create a certain atmosphere . 
 In Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow @-@ Stanshall 's musical , <unk> , a Comic Opera , the lead performer is an ageing music hall artiste named <unk> . 
 British rockers Queen incorporated music hall styles into several of their songs , such as 1974 's " Killer Queen " and 1976 's " Good Old @-@ Fashioned Lover Boy " . 
 Garry Bushell 's punk <unk> band , The <unk> , did rock versions of music hall songs . Many punk <unk> acts were indebted to the music hall tradition . 
 The Theatre of the Absurd was heavily influenced by music hall in its use of comedy , as well as avant @-@ garde cultural forms ( such as surrealism ) being a more obvious influence . 
 The spirit of the music hall lives on in the form of pensioner rapper , Ida Barr who mashes up music hall and rap . Based on a real artiste , the act is performed by Christopher Green . 
 = = Surviving music halls = = 
 London was the centre of music hall with hundreds of venues , often in the entertainment rooms of public houses . With the decline in popularity of music hall , many were abandoned , or converted to other uses , such as cinemas and their interiors lost . There are a number of purpose @-@ built survivors , including the Hackney Empire , an outstanding example of the late music hall period ( Frank Matcham 1901 ) . This has been restored to its Moorish splendour and now provides an eclectic programme of events from opera to " Black Variety Nights " . A mile to the south is Hoxton Hall an 1863 example of the saloon @-@ style . It is unrestored but maintained in its original layout , and currently used as a community centre and theatre . In the neighbouring borough , Collins Music Hall ( built about 1860 ) still stands on the north side of Islington Green . The hall closed in the 1960s and currently forms part of a bookshop . 
 In Clapham , The Grand , originally the Grand Palace of Varieties ( 1900 ) , has been restored , but its interior reflects its modern use as a music venue and nightclub . The Greenwich Theatre was originally the Rose and Crown Music Hall ( 1855 ) , and later became ' Crowder 's Music Hall and Temple of Varieties ' . The building has been extensively modernised and little of the original layout remains . 
 In the nondescript Grace 's Alley , off Cable Street , Stepney stands Wilton 's Music Hall . This 1858 example of the giant pub hall survived use as a church , fire , flood and war intact , but was virtually derelict , after its use as a rag warehouse , in the 1960s . The Wilton 's Music Hall Trust has embarked on a fund @-@ raising campaign to restore the building . In June 2007 , the World Monuments Fund added the building to its list of the world 's " 100 most endangered sites " . The music video of the Frankie Goes to Hollywood single Relax was shot here . Many of these buildings can be seen as part of the annual London Open House event . 
 There are also surviving music halls outside London , a notable example being the Leeds City Varieties ( 1865 ) with a preserved interior . This was used for many years as the setting for the BBC television variety show , based on the music hall genre , The Good Old Days . The Alhambra Theatre , Bradford was built in 1914 for theatre impresario Francis <unk> , and later owned by the Stoll @-@ Moss Empire ' . It was restored in 1986 , and is a fine example of the late Edwardian style . It is now a receiving theatre for touring productions , and opera . 
 In Nottingham , the Malt Cross music hall retains its restored cast @-@ iron interior . It is run as a cafe bar by a Christian charitable trust promoting responsible drinking , also as the location of a safe space late at night and for operating a street pastor service . It is an award @-@ winning and popular venue true to its original purpose of providing a venue for up and coming musical acts . 
 In Northern Ireland , the Grand Opera House , Belfast , Frank Matcham 1895 , was preserved and restored in the 1980s . The Gaiety Theatre , Isle of Man is another Matcham design from 1900 that remains in use after an extensive restoration programme in the 1970s . In Glasgow , the Britannia Music Hall ( 1857 ) , by architects Thomas <unk> and H.M. McFarlane remains standing , with much of the theatre intact but in a poor state having closed in 1938 . There is a preservation trust attempting to rescue the theatre . 
 One of the few fully functional music hall entertainments , is at the Brick Lane Music Hall in a former church in North Woolwich . The Players ' Theatre Club is another group performing a Victorian style music hall show at a variety of venues and The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America stage music hall @-@ style entertainments . 
 = Monaro Highway = 
 The Monaro Highway is a highway that is located in Victoria , New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory , in Australia . 
 The 285 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 177 mi ) roadway links Cann River in Victoria to Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory ( ACT ) via the Monaro region . From its southern terminus , it follows the nearby Cann River upstream towards the New South Wales border through heavily forested terrain . Within New South Wales ( NSW ) , it makes its way through further forest before reaching the pastures typical of the Monaro . There are multiple towns and villages along the highway , including Bombala , Nimmitabel , and Cooma . The terrain within the Monaro is largely hilly , and there are numerous crossings . The road also parallels the former Bombala railway line in several locations . Within the ACT , the road becomes a high volume roadway and serves the southern suburbs of Canberra . 
 Originally known as Cann Valley Road , the Victorian section was designated as a highway in 1960 , and received the name Cann Valley Highway . The Monaro Highway name was applied to the road within Victoria in 1996 . Within NSW , the highway was created in 1938 and designated as State Highway 19 within the Department of Main Roads . In 1958 , It was named the Monaro Highway in both NSW and the ACT , though the same name had been in use by the Snowy Mountains Highway until 1955 . The Monaro Highway has more recently had a grade @-@ separated dual carriageway extension constructed within Canberra , as part of the Eastern Parkway construction project . 
 The Monaro Highway initially bore the National Route 23 route markers along its entire length , excluding the Eastern Parkway extension , which was instead part of Alternate National Route 23 . Now that each jurisdiction has converted to alphanumeric markers , it instead carries the B23 route marker along almost its entire length . The extension currently does not have a route marker . There is a duplex along the highway where it additionally carries the <unk> route marker between the two sections of the Snowy Mountains Highway . Within the ACT , a section of the road is also part of Tourist Drive 5 .

 The Monaro Highway begins at the Princes Highway in Cann River in the East Gippsland region . After leaving the town , it heads north along a relatively flat area following the Cann River upstream through a locality known as <unk> . To the west is farmland between the road and river and a mountain range beyond and to the east are some smaller hills . The land to the east is largely part of Drummer State Forest . As the sides close in at the northern end of this wider valley area , the highway crosses to the west bank of the river highway and enters the <unk> North locality . Continuing north , the terrain is more hilly and forested and the alignment more closely parallels the winding river upstream to the area of <unk> . At this point , the land to the west of the river is part of <unk> State Forest , and to the east is <unk> National Park . The road has now entered the Chandlers Creek locality and at <unk> , the road crosses the west branch of the Cann River and continues further north along the east branch through a small farmland area . From here , it follows the river through more forest before coming to another small farmland area and crossing Chandlers Creek itself . The road once again enters forest as it follows the Cann River east branch to its upper end at the confluence of Fiddlers Green Creek and Flat Rock Creek , the latter of which the road follows through <unk> National Park to the New South Wales border . 
 = = = New South Wales = = = 
 From the state border , the road continues north through forest , generally keeping Bondi State Forest to the west and South East Forest National Park to the east . The immediate landscape by the roadside also includes the occasional small tract of farmland at several points . There is a crossing over the Genoa River within the forest , and the road roughly follows it upstream . Upon exiting the large forested area that exists near the border , the road enters farmland . This farmland continues as a patchwork of pastures for the rest of the journey within New South Wales and is only interrupted by the occasional town . The road continues roughly northwest until it meets Delegate Road at a T @-@ intersection just outside Bombala . Turning towards the northeast at the intersection , the road quickly reaches Bombala . Within the urban area , the road firstly takes on the name Maybe Street . It then turns northeast at Forbes Street and crosses over the Bombala River . After the bridge , the road returns to a northeast heading as Mahratta Street . This street continues for a short distance before a right angle bend to the northwest to match the same manoeuvre by the river . The road then becomes Stephen Street before returning to the Monaro Highway name at the edge of the urban area and concluding its zig @-@ zag trajectory through Bombala . 
 The road then travels in a north @-@ easterly direction , crossing the Bombala River again and making its way towards <unk> . The road bypasses the village just to its west and makes a further crossing of the Bombala River . Continuing north , the road winds its way towards a ridge near Native Dog Creek . After crossing the creek , the road climbs the ridge and continues northbound . At this point , the former Bombala railway line alignment winds along the western side and is visible in some locations . Eventually the road swings east and meets the western end of the eastern section of the Snowy Mountains Highway at another T @-@ intersection . The Monaro Highway turns towards the northwest at this intersection and , after a short distance , crosses the <unk> River . A little further along this heading , the road enters Nimmitabel . The highway takes on the name Bombala Street within the urban area and swings to the northeast through the small town . From here , the road continues northwest once again with the railway alignment never far to the west and sometimes paralleling the road . The road crosses several small creeks along this stretch of road . Before reaching Cooma , the road also passes to the west of Kuma Nature Reserve and crosses over the former Bombala railway line . Within the town of Cooma , the road initially takes up the name Bombala Street . Where this street meets Sharp Street at a 4 @-@ way roundabout , the highway turns east , while the western section of the Snowy Mountains Highway begins from the same point and heads west . Continuing east as Sharp Street , the road soon curves north and transitions back to the Monaro Highway . It then parallels the railway within the urban area and also passes by the Tadeusz Kościuszko Monument as it leaves the town . 
 North of Cooma , the highway follows the same general path as the railway alignment as far as the area of Bunyan . From there , it continues along the same rough heading and crosses the Numeralla River just prior to its confluence with the Murrumbidgee River . The road then follows the Murrumbidgee downstream at some distance to its east . The highway continues on towards Bredbo and crosses the Bredbo River as it enters the village . The highway takes on the name Cooma Street through Bredbo and crosses over the railway yet again just north of the town . Further to the north , the road passes through <unk> Gap to the east of Round Hill . Mount Colinton is now visible to the highway 's east , and a larger range known as the Clear Range is visible to west . The ridgeline of the Clear Range forms the eastern border of the ACT in this area . Heading further downstream , continuing the distant parallel of the Murrumbidgee , the road enters Michelago and crosses the railway a final few times as the railway winds through the area . It does not enter the urban area of Michelago itself and instead passes to the west of the village . North of Michelago the road and railway parallel each other very closely as they head towards the ACT border at the north end of the Clear Range . The road crosses the border just east of Cunningham Hill . 
 = = = Australian Capital Territory = = = 
 From the territory border , the road passes into the rural southern reaches of the Tuggeranong District . In this area of the ACT , the railway line forms the eastern border of the territory , with the railway line itself situated on the NSW side . To the western side of the road flows Guises Creek , with a range of hills beyond it , Rose Hill and Mount Rob Roy being two of the more prominent peaks . As the road reaches the Tuggeranong urban area , it begins to parallel the urban area instead and forms part of the border of Tuggeranong 's eastern suburbs . Approaching the Tharwa Drive intersection , the road becomes a dual carriageway . The road climbs onto a small ridge with views of the urban area to the west and the Tuggeranong Pine Plantation to the east . The road then descends towards the Jerrabomberra district border where it meets Isabella Drive , and then passes through the light industrial suburb of Hume , although the land to the west of the road is largely undeveloped . Within Hume , the road meets Lanyon Drive , which heads across the nearby border towards Jerrabomberra and Queanbeyan . The road then continues roughly north and crosses a largely open area of pasture . The <unk> emergency helicopter is stationed to the east of the road not far after its intersection with Lanyon Drive , and further on , a prison is located to the west . Approaching the northern end of the pasture , Jerrabomberra Creek flows to the east . At the northern end is the Hindmarsh Drive interchange . The highway passes underneath Hindmarsh Drive and continues over Jerrabomberra Creek . A further interchange , passing over Canberra Avenue is a little further on , along with an overpass above the Canberra railway line branch , and an interchange above Newcastle Street . The road then <unk> across a wide flat and terminates at Morshead Drive , just across the Molonglo River . In 2010 the average annual daily traffic count was approximately 43 @,@ 000 vehicles per day , at this final section just prior to the northern terminus .

 A minor road appears in this region on Thomas Mitchell 's 1834 map of the Nineteen Counties of New South Wales . Located within Murray county , the road continues from Bungendore towards the south before turning west crossing the Queanbeyan River near its confluence with the Molonglo River ( The current location of Queanbeyan ) , and then heads south towards what was then known as the " <unk> Plains " ( now Michelago ) . The road is then marked as continuing south beyond the border of the county ; although no settlement could legally occur beyond the Nineteen Counties at that time , those who settled beyond this area were known as squatters . The detail of the road beyond Murray county is not plotted on the map . By 1844 the road had reached Cooma , and was extended to Bombala by 1852 . Mapping from 1882 shows the road had extended all the way to the Victorian border , crossing near Delegate .

 The Cann Valley Highway was designated a state highway on 10 August 1960 , and was formerly known as Cann Valley Road . The roadway was sealed along its entire length to the border in March 1985 as part of the Bicentennial Road Development Programme . It was again renamed as the Monaro Highway on 25 October 1996 to match the highway to which it connects at the NSW border . Within Victoria , <unk> has classified the Monaro Highway as an arterial road , with the road number <unk> . 
 = = = = New South Wales = = = = 
 The roads of New South Wales were re @-@ classified by the Main Roads Board ( MRB ) in their 1928 annual report . The following year , the MRB 's hierarchical system which supported this listing was proclaimed with the passing of the Main Roads ( Amendment ) Act , April 1929 . The roads forming the future highway were given the following classifications : 
 Trunk Road 53 between the Victorian border and Nimmitabel ( via Delegate ) . 
 State Highway 4 between Nimmitabel and Cooma . 
 Trunk Road 52 between Cooma and the ACT . 
 The Monaro Highway name was actually applied to State Highway 4 at that time , which ran from Tathra to Wagga Wagga . It was decided to expand the main roads network over the following years , and in 1938 the Trunk Road sections of the future highway were reclassified as State Highway 19 by the Department of Main Roads ( DMR ) ( which had succeeded the MRB in 1932 ) . State Highway 19 at this time connected to the <unk> Highway at the Victoria Border . In 1955 it was decided to rename State Highway 4 , and it was renamed as the Snowy Mountains Highway . As part of these changes the section of the State Highway 4 between Nimmitabel and Cooma was also redesignated to be part of State Highway 19 . Three years later in 1958 , the various roads classified as State Highway 19 , were then named the Monaro Highway . In contrast with the Snowy Mountains Highway , the entire length of State Highway 19 was within the Monaro region . During the mid to late 1960s the highway south of Nimmitabel was rerouted along a newly constructed roadway . The former alignment is now known as Old Bombala Road . The Snowy Mountains Highway was also realigned in this area as part of these works and connected to the Monaro Highway along the new alignment . In November 1976 , the alignment was changed so as not to pass through Delegate any longer . The highway now connected to what was then the Cann Valley Highway in Victoria . The former alignment was classified as Main Road 93 and is now known as Delegate Road for most of its length . The State Highway terminology is no longer used , and as such the Monaro Highway is currently classified as Highway 19 ( or <unk> ) by Roads and Maritime Services .

 In 1958 Federal government agreed to apply the Monaro Highway name to Cooma @-@ Canberra road within the ACT . This gave the roadway a single name between Canberra and the Victorian border . Originally , the highway ended where it met Jerrabomberra Avenue . Plans were publicised during the mid @-@ 1980s for an upgrade of the existing Monaro Highway to dual @-@ carriageway standard between Isabella Drive and Jerrabomberra Avenue , and an extension of the roadway to the north . These works were known as the Eastern Parkway . These plans were then given the go ahead in a report tabled on 5 May 1987 , the estimated costs were $ 50 million including upgrades to other nearby roadways . Around the same time period a large service centre was proposed for near the Isabella Drive intersection , though it was quite controversial , and the developer pulled out . Between 1988 and November 1989 the duplication was completed , and the roadway extended as far as Canberra Avenue . After this the road was extended to its current terminus at Morshead Drive , although the northbound carriageway was originally routed over Dairy Flat Road until a southbound carriageway was constructed later on . Further duplication was performed to other sections of the extension until all sections were completed in mid @-@ 2012 . The northern end of the Monaro Highway will connect to the southern end of the Majura Parkway following its expected completion in 2016 . Territory and Municipal Services has classified the Monaro Highway as an arterial road within the ACT Road Hierarchy . 
 = = = Route markers = = = 
 Route markers were first introduced in Australia in late 1954 . Over the following decades they were progressively rolled out to the various highways around the nation , under a nationwide route numbering scheme . The highway originally carried the National Route 23 route marker . Although after the construction of the Eastern Parkway extension , the highway north of Canberra Avenue was signed with the Alternate National Route 23 route marker . The section of the Monaro Highway between Steeple Flat and Cooma was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length ; this kind of arrangement is known as a concurrency . This allowed one route to cover the Snowy Mountains Highway from end to end , as the Monaro Highway forms a link between that highway 's two sections . 
 After Victoria converted to alphanumeric route markers the Victorian section was signed as B23 . In 2013 the NSW / ACT conversion to alphanumeric routes occurred and the remainder of the highway ( south of Hindmarsh Drive in the ACT ) was then also signed as B23 . The route duplex along the Monaro Highway remains intact with <unk> used in addition to B23 between Steeple Flat and Cooma , to link the two sections of the Snowy Mountains Highway . North of Hindmarsh Drive , the highway no longer carries a route marker .

 = Peveril Castle = 
 Peveril Castle ( also Castleton Castle or Peak Castle ) is a ruined 11th @-@ century castle overlooking the village of Castleton in the English county of Derbyshire . It was the main settlement ( or caput ) of the feudal barony of William Peverel , known as the Honour of Peverel , and was founded some time between the Norman Conquest of 1066 and its first recorded mention in the Domesday Survey of 1086 , by Peverel , who held lands in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire as a tenant @-@ in @-@ chief of the king . The town became the economic centre of the barony . The castle has views across the Hope Valley and Cave Dale . 
 William Peveril the Younger inherited his father 's estates , but in 1155 they were confiscated by King Henry II . While in royal possession , Henry visited the castle in 1157 , 1158 , and 1164 , the first time hosting King Malcolm IV of Scotland . During the Revolt of 1173 – 1174 , the castle 's garrison was increased from a porter and two watchmen to a force led by 20 knights shared with the castles of Bolsover and Nottingham . The Earls of Derby had a claim to the Peveril family 's estates through marriage , and in 1199 William de Ferrers , the fourth earl , paid 2 @,@ 000 marks for the Peak lordship , although the castle remained under royal control . The closest Peveril Castle came to seeing battle was in 1216 , when King John gave the castle to William de Ferrers , but the castellan refused to relinquish control . Although they were both John 's supporters , the king authorised the earl to use force to evict the castellan , who eventually capitulated , although there is no evidence that the castle was assaulted . 
 In 1223 the castle returned to the Crown . In the 13th century there were periods of building work at the castle , and by 1300 its final form had been established . Toward the end of the 14th century , the barony was granted to John of Gaunt , Duke of Lancaster . Having little use for the castle , he ordered some of its material to be stripped out for re @-@ use , marking the beginning of its decline . From the time of John of Gaunt to the present day , the castle has been owned and administered by the Duchy of Lancaster . Peveril Castle became less important administratively , and by 1609 it was " very ruinous and <unk> for no use " . In the 19th century , Sir Walter Scott featured the castle in his novel Peveril of the Peak . The site is situated in a national park , and cared for by English Heritage . Peveril Castle is protected as a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building . 
 = = History = = 
 Peveril Castle stands on a limestone outcrop overlooking the west end of Hope Valley , in the midst of an ancient landscape . Overlooking the head of the valley , 2 km to the west , is Mam Tor , a Bronze Age hill fort , and 2 miles ( 3 km ) to the east at Brough @-@ on @-@ Noe is the Roman fort of Navio . The valley formed a natural line of communication and had extra importance due to valuable mineral resources in the area , particularly lead . 
 = = = From the Norman Conquest = = = 
 The small Hope Castle lay halfway along the valley . The castle 's founder , William Peveril , was a follower of William the Conqueror and was rewarded for supporting him during the Norman Conquest . The first mention of him in England records that in 1068 he was granted the new castle at Nottingham by William the Conqueror , who was in the process of subduing the Midlands and northern England . An unsubstantiated legend states that Peveril was William 's illegitimate son . By the Domesday Book of 1086 , Peveril had become a powerful landowner , with holdings in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire . The exact year he founded the castle is uncertain , although it must have been started by 1086 as it is recorded in the Domesday Book , one of 48 castles mentioned in the survey and the only one in Derbyshire . The castle was recorded as standing at <unk> which has been translated as both " Peak 's Tail " and " Peak 's Arse " . Although the earliest Norman castles were usually built in timber , Peveril Castle seems to have been designed from outset to be built in stone . 
 William Peveril had custody of royal lands such as the district of Hope , and although he had his own estates , he relied on continued royal favour to maintain power in this way . In 1100 the new king , Henry I , granted William " his demesne in the Peak " . Thus the Peak became an independent lordship under William Peveril 's control , and the castle became an important centre of administration for the area , allowing the collection of taxes . Castleton benefited from the castle 's new status and began to grow as the lordship 's economic heart . William Peveril died in 1114 and was succeeded by his son , William Peveril the Younger . In the civil war known as The Anarchy between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda , Peveril backed the losing side and his fortunes suffered after his capture at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141 . In 1153 Peveril was suspected of attempting to poison Ranulf de Gernon , 4th Earl of Chester . In 1153 the future King Henry II accused Peveril of " plundering and treachery " and threatened to confiscate his estates and hand them over to the Earl of Chester . Two years later Henry , now king , followed through his threat . The Earl of Chester was dead by this time , and the king kept the property for himself . Once under royal control , Peveril became the administrative centre of the Forest of High Peak . 
 William Peveril the Younger died in 1155 , and as his only male heir had predeceased him , the family 's claim on the confiscated estates was taken up by the husband of William 's daughter , Margaret Peveril . Margaret had married Robert de Ferrers , 2nd Earl of Derby . King Henry II visited Peveril Castle three times during his reign . During the first visit , in 1157 , he hosted King Malcolm IV of Scotland who paid homage to Henry after ceding Cumberland and Westmorland to the English king . Henry II visited again in 1158 and 1164 . When a group of barons led by Henry 's sons Henry the Young King , Geoffrey , Duke of Brittany , and Prince Richard , later Richard the Lionheart , took part in the Revolt of 1173 – 1174 against the king 's rule , the king spent £ 116 on building work at Peveril and Bolsover Castles in Derbyshire . The garrison was also increased . Previously Peveril was guarded by two watchmen and a porter , but this was expanded to a force led by 20 knights shared with Bolsover and Nottingham castles during the revolt . After the revolt ended in 1174 , further steps were taken to improve Peveril Castle , and the Pipe Rolls ( records of royal expenditure ) show that between 1175 and 1177 £ 184 was spent on building the keep . Building in stone was expensive , and though Peveril 's keep was small , moderately @-@ sized stone castles such as the contemporary Orford could cost thousands of pounds . Henry II 's average income during his reign has been estimated to be around £ 10 @,@ 000 per year . As few documents have survived , it is uncertain when parts of the castle were built , and archaeological investigations have been unsuccessful in dating the stonework . Henry II died in 1189 and was succeeded by his son , Richard the Lionheart . Soon after his coronation , Richard granted the lordship of the Peak , including the castle , to his brother John . While Richard was on crusade , John rebelled and on his return Richard confiscated the lordship . 
 John became king in 1199 after Richard 's death . William de Ferrers , 4th Earl of Derby maintained the claim of the Earls of Derby to the Peveril estates . He paid King John 2000 marks ( £ 1333 ) for the lordship of the Peak , but the Crown retained possession of Peveril and Bolsover Castles . John finally gave Ferrers these castles in 1216 to secure his support in the face of country @-@ wide rebellion . However , the castellan Brian de Lisle refused to hand them over . Although de Lisle and Ferrers were both King John 's supporters , the king gave Ferrers permission to use force to retake the castles . 
 = = = Henry III = = = 
 The situation was still chaotic when King Henry III became king after his father 's death in 1216 . Although Bolsover fell to Ferrers ' forces in 1217 after a siege , there is no indication that Peveril was assaulted , and it is likely that Brian de Lisle negotiated his surrender . Ferrers only had possession of the lordship until King Henry III came of age . When the time came he was reluctant to hand over the property , and after an initial deadlock the Crown took control in 1223 . Although contemporary Pipe Roll records of expenditure at Peveril survive , they do not specify how the money was spent . As a result , it is unclear what constitutes maintenance and what marks substantial construction work ; however , Richard Eales , who wrote the 2006 English Heritage guidebook , suggests that there were two periods of building , when sums spent were larger than usual : £ 54 in 1204 – 1207 and £ 67 in 1210 – 1212 . The medieval historian Sidney Painter estimated that in about 1200 there were only seven magnates in England whose annual income exceeded £ 400 and a knight could easily live on £ 10 to £ 20 per year . 
 The rest of the 13th century was relatively peaceful , and records show that Peveril Castle was maintained by the Crown . In 1235 , in preparation for the king 's visit , the north wall and bridge were repaired . After significant work in 1250 – 52 ( £ 60 spent ) , 1272 – 1275 ( £ 40 ) and 1288 – 1290 ( £ 151 ) , it is likely that the castle buildings were complete by 1300 . King Henry gave Prince Edward ( later King Edward I ) Peveril Castle along with the County Palatine of Chester with the royal holdings in Wales and Ireland . Some of the lands , including Peveril , were made part of Eleanor of Castile 's dower , to come into her possession should her husband , Prince Edward , die . At this time , the Peak lordship was worth around £ 300 a year . At the outbreak of the Second Barons ' War in 1264 , Peveril Castle was occupied by Robert de Ferrers , 6th Earl of Derby . Simon de Montfort pressured King Henry III into giving him Peveril , although it was recovered by the Crown after De Montfort 's death in 1265 . The castle was returned to Eleanor 's dower , and as she predeceased her husband the lordship returned into royal hands . Its income was used to provide for members of the royal family such as King Edward II 's queen , Isabella of France , and their children , and royal favourites such as Piers Gaveston . In 1331 Edward III gave the lordship to his wife , Philippa of Hainault . It was given to John de Warenne , 7th Earl of Surrey , in 1345 . After its return to the Crown , the estate was given to John of Gaunt , Edward III 's third surviving son , partially in exchange for the Earldom of Richmond . 
 = = = The Lancastrians = = = 
 John of Gaunt 's ownership marked the start of Peveril Castle 's decline . He was the richest nobleman in England and held several castles . As Peveril Castle was relatively unimportant , John decided not to maintain it and in 1374 gave orders to strip the lead from the buildings for re @-@ use at Pontefract Castle . It was inherited by his son Henry Bolingbroke , later King Henry IV , and remained under royal control , administered by the Duchy of Lancaster . During the 15th century , Peveril became less important as administrative functions were moved elsewhere . Although other castles administered by the Duchy of Lancaster were repaired in 1480 , there is no indication that this happened at Peveril . A survey conducted for the Duchy in 1561 revealed that Peveril was in a state of decay , and as a result , along with Donnington , was one of two castles that were subsequently abandoned . The castle however hosted local courts until 1600 . A survey in 1609 found that Peveril was " very ruinous and <unk> for no use " . At some point in the post @-@ medieval period the keep 's facing stone was removed from three sides . The steep slope prevented the removal of the stone from the fourth side . At one point , the castle was used to house animals . 
 = = = Modern era = = = 
 With the advent of the railways in the 19th century , the area became a tourist attraction . The Duchy of Lancaster undertook maintenance in the 19th century to ensure the castle 's condition did not deteriorate further , mostly by clearing rubble and adding mortar . Sir Walter Scott 's 1823 novel Peveril of the Peak , set in the mid 17th century , described the castle ruins . 
 In 1932 the Duchy gave custody of the castle to the Office of Works , while retaining ownership . The site is today cared for by English Heritage , the successor to the Office of Works . The surrounding landscape has been protected as a national park since 1951 . The castle is a scheduled monument , which means it is a " nationally important " historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change . It is also a Grade I listed building ( first listed in 1985 ) , and recognised as an internationally important structure . It has been described as " perhaps the finest medieval landmark of the Peak District " , and architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner remarked that it is " By far the most important castle in the county – in fact the only one of importance " . Before Duffield Castle in the south of the county was destroyed in 1266 it had one of the largest keeps in England , though only the foundations survive . 
 = = Layout = = 
 Peveril Castle in Castleton is roughly triangular in shape , about 90 by 65 m ( 295 by 213 ft ) , on top of a hill overlooking the Hope Valley . The land slopes steeply away from the castle 's perimeter , forming an almost sheer face to the south east , and the winding approach from the north is the most practical way to the castle . Not only was the site naturally defensible , but its prominence would have allowed the castle to be a highly visible symbol of the builder 's power . The town of Castleton provided supplies to the castle . It commands views of Hope Valley below and Treak Cliff , Mam Tor , Black Tor , and Lose Hill . The castle was entered through the gatehouse to the east . Its design was simple , 7 m ( 23 ft ) wide with a <unk> 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 ft 2 in ) across . Little survives , although earlier drawings contain details of mouldings that suggest the structure was built in the 12th century , perhaps by Henry II or King John . 
 The curtain walls enclosing the castle show the multiple phases of construction at Peveril , with stonework from the Norman period – differentiated by the use of opus spicatum – to modern repairs . The walls were surmounted by walkways , which next to the gatehouse would have stood about 5 m ( 16 ft ) above the ground level immediately outside the castle . In the 12th century , a tower projecting less than 2 m ( 6 ft 7 in ) was added to the north wall . In Eales ' opinion , it " would have been of limited military value , compared with the boldly projecting towers of later castles " which allowed defenders to deploy flanking fire along the base of the walls . The land within the castle slopes downwards from west to east . Water storage would have been a concern for the garrison of the castle , but how they procured water is uncertain . 
 The southern curtain wall is a modern replacement along the line of the medieval wall . There are the remains of two round or semi @-@ circular towers projecting from the wall . Enough of one tower survives that one can see the use of Roman tiles in the construction , probably from the fort of Navio 2 mi ( 3 km ) away . It is uncertain when these towers were built , although it is thought they may date from the 13th century . Foundations mark the position of buildings abutting the south wall , probably the old hall and a chapel . A document from 1246 recorded a chapel at the castle ; the remains of the easternmost building against the south wall are assumed to mark the site of the chapel , as they are oriented roughly east – west . Foundations at the west end of the north wall mark a large building : probably a hall where the lord of the castle would have eaten and entertained high @-@ status guests . It is unclear when the new hall was built , probably replacing the old hall in the south of the castle , although an " old hall " was mentioned in a document of 1251 , implying there was also a new hall by that time . The kitchen and food stores would have stood at the east end of the hall , although little remains of those structures . Buildings were also constructed against the west curtain wall , probably high @-@ status apartments . Although the main approach to Peveril Castle was from the north , there was also a gate in the west . A bridge spanned the gorge , linking the castle with an enclosure on the other side . As it has not been excavated , the exact form the enclosure took is uncertain . Its purpose is also a matter of speculation , whether it was an elaborate outer bailey for defence or used for storage and stabling . 
 The keep occupies the southern corner of Peveril Castle . Construction probably began in around 1176 , instigated by Henry II . Its plan is square , measuring less than 12 by 12 m ( 39 by 39 ft ) , and the parapet is 15 m ( 49 ft ) above the keep 's base ; as the ground is uneven , on the other side it rises 10 @.@ 5 m ( 34 ft ) above ground level . It is smaller than contemporary royal keeps such as those at Dover and Scarborough Castles . Today the exterior is coarse , but originally the facing would have been smooth ; the south @-@ east side , where the steep natural slope prevented removal of the facing stone , gives an idea of how it may once have appeared . A projection in the south @-@ east face of the keep housed a garderobe . As was usual with Norman keeps , Peveril 's was entered through the first floor and was accessed by a staircase . This entrance level would have been a large public room and the basement used for storage . A narrow staircase in the east corner allowed access to the basement and the wall walk around the top of the keep . 
 = The Beatles in India = 
 In February 1968 , the Beatles travelled to Rishikesh , in northern India , to attend an advanced Transcendental Meditation ( TM ) training session at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . Amid widespread media attention , their visit was one of the band 's most productive periods . Led by George Harrison 's commitment , the Beatles ' interest in the Maharishi changed Western attitudes about Indian spirituality and encouraged the study of Transcendental Meditation . 
 The Beatles first met the Maharishi in London in August 1967 and then attended a seminar in Bangor , Wales . They had planned to attend the entire ten @-@ day session , but their stay was cut short by the death of their manager , Brian Epstein . Wanting to learn more , they kept in contact with the Maharishi and made arrangements to spend time with him at his teaching centre located near Rishikesh , in " the Valley of the Saints " at the foothills of the Himalayas . 
 Along with their wives , girlfriends , assistants and numerous reporters , the Beatles arrived in India in February 1968 and joined the group of 60 people who were training to be TM teachers , including musicians Donovan , Mike Love of the Beach Boys , and flautist Paul Horn . While there , John Lennon , Paul McCartney and Harrison wrote many songs and Ringo Starr finished writing his first . Eighteen of those songs were recorded for The Beatles ( " the White Album " ) , two songs appeared on the Abbey Road album , and others were used for various solo projects . 
 Starr and his wife left on 1 March , after a ten @-@ day stay ; McCartney left after one month due to other commitments ; while Lennon and Harrison stayed about six weeks , then left abruptly following financial disagreements and rumours of inappropriate behaviour by the Maharishi . Harrison later apologised for the way he and Lennon had treated the Maharishi , and in 1992 gave a benefit concert for the Maharishi @-@ associated Natural Law Party . In 2009 , McCartney and Starr performed at a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation , which raises funds for the teaching of Transcendental Meditation to at @-@ risk students . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1960s , the Beatles became interested in Indian culture , after using drugs in an effort to expand their consciousness and in 1966 Harrison visited India for six weeks and took sitar lessons from Ravi Shankar . Alexis " Magic Alex " Mardas , a friend of the Beatles and head of Apple Electronics , had heard a lecture by the Maharishi in Athens , Greece and Harrison 's wife , Pattie Boyd , attended a lecture by the Maharishi in London and they encouraged the Beatles to hear the Maharishi speak . 
 At Boyd 's suggestion , the Beatles attended the Maharishi 's lecture at the London Hilton on Park Lane on 24 August 1967 . The Maharishi had announced his intention to retire , so this was expected to be his last public lecture in the West . Some band members had seen him on a Granada TV program years earlier . The Beatles were given front row seats and were invited to meet the Maharishi in his hotel suite after the lecture . During the ninety @-@ minute meeting , he invited them to be his guests at a training retreat in Wales . 
 Two days later , on 26 August , the Beatles travelled by train to the college campus in Bangor , Wales . It was perhaps the first time the band had travelled without their tour managers and they had not even thought to bring money . The station was mobbed because of a bank holiday and Cynthia Lennon , mistaken for a fan , was held back . She ran after the train but missed it and arrived later by car . The group , along with Mick Jagger , Marianne Faithfull , Cilla Black , Harrison 's sister @-@ in @-@ law Jenny Boyd , and around 300 others , learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation , and were given their mantras . The group " hesitated only slightly " when asked to donate the customary week 's wages , a large sum for a Beatle , to learn . While there , they announced at a press conference that they were giving up drugs ( apparently referring to psychedelics , but not marijuana ) . This was a choice " in keeping with the Maharishi 's teachings " but one made prior to meeting the Maharishi . The Maharishi did advise them privately to avoid involvement with the " Ban the Bomb " movement and to support the elected government of the day . Their intention was to attend the entire ten @-@ day seminar but their stay was cut short by the death of their manager , Epstein , in London on 27 August . The Maharishi consoled them by saying that Epstein 's spirit was still with them and their good thoughts would help him " to have an easy passage " and journey to his " next evolution " . According to McCartney , the Maharishi " was great to us when Brian died " and Cynthia Lennon wrote " it was as though , with Brian gone , the four needed someone new to give them direction and the Maharishi was in the right place at the right time . " 
 Curious to learn more , the Beatles made plans to spend time at the " Maharishi 's training center " in India in late October . However , the trip was postponed due to commitments related to the Magical Mystery Tour film and the soundtrack album . Harrison and Lennon appeared twice on David Frost 's programme in autumn 1967 to talk about their involvement with TM when , according to Lennon 's wife , John was " evangelical in his enthusiasm for Maharishi " . Now publicised as " The Beatles ' Guru " , the Maharishi went on his eighth world tour , giving lectures in Britain , Scandinavia , Germany , Italy , Canada , and California . At that time , Lennon said that , thanks to his meditation , " I 'm a better person and I wasn 't bad before . " When the Maharishi spoke to 3 @,@ 600 people at Madison Square Garden in New York City , in January 1968 , the Beatles sent a large flower arrangement to his suite at the Plaza Hotel . 
 Harrison flew to Bombay in January 1968 to work on the Wonderwall Music soundtrack , expecting the rest of the group to follow shortly . When they were delayed he flew back to London , where the group spent a week in the studio . Before leaving for India , the band recorded the instrumental tracks for " Across the Universe " , whose refrain , " Jai Guru Deva " , was a standard greeting within the Maharishi 's Spiritual Regeneration Movement . Also in January , the Maharishi , Mia Farrow , Prudence Farrow and their brother , flew from the US to London and on to India .

 Lennon , his wife Cynthia , the Harrisons and Jenny Boyd arrived in Delhi on 15 February , where they were met by Mal Evans , their advance man , who had arranged the 150 @-@ mile ( 240 km ) , six @-@ hour taxi drive to Rishikesh . McCartney , his girlfriend Jane Asher , Starr and his wife Maureen arrived four days later . The group arrived three weeks after the session , due to end 25 April , had already begun . They were accompanied by a small retinue of reporters and photographers who were mostly kept out of the fenced and gated compound . Entourage members Evans , Brown and Neil Aspinall were there for all or part of the time and Mardas arrived four weeks later . 
 As soon as Starr arrived in Delhi he asked Evans to take him to a doctor because of a reaction to an inoculation : " When we arrived at the local hospital , I tried to get immediate treatment for him [ Starr ] , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor , ' He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn . ' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say it will be all right " . Also there at the same time were Mia Farrow , her sister Prudence and brother John , Donovan , Gyp " Gypsy Dave " Mills , Mike Love , jazz flautist Paul Horn , journalist Lewis H. Lapham , film @-@ maker Paul Saltzman , socialite Nancy Cooke de Herrera , actors Tom Simcox and Jerry Stovin , and dozens of others , all Europeans or Americans . Despite speculation , Shirley MacLaine did not attend and Lennon , who had thought of bringing Yoko Ono , decided against it . 
 = = = Facility = = = 
 Located in the holy " Valley of the Saints " , the International Academy of Meditation , also called the <unk> <unk> ashram , was a 14 @-@ acre ( 57 @,@ 000 m2 ) compound . It stood across the River Ganges from Rishikesh , the " yoga capital of the world " and home to many ashrams in the foothills of the Himalayas , 150 feet ( 46 m ) above the river and surrounded by jungle . The Maharishi 's facility was built in 1963 with a $ 100 @,@ 000 gift from American heiress Doris Duke , on land leased from the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department . The training centre was designed to suit Western habits and was described variously as " luxurious " and " seedy " . Starr later compared the ashram to " a kind of spiritual Butlins " ( a low @-@ cost British holiday camp ) . It was built to accommodate several dozen people and each of its stone bungalows contained five rooms . Each was equipped with electric heaters , running water , toilets , and English @-@ style furniture . According to <unk> , the Maharishi obtained many " special items " from a nearby village so that the Beatles rooms would have mirrors , wall @-@ to @-@ wall carpeting , wall coverings , " foam mattresses " and bedspreads . She wrote that " by the standard of the other " bungalows , the Beatles ' cottages " looked like a palace " . 
 While the Beatles were there , the Maharishi was negotiating with the Indian government to use some nearby parkland for an airstrip for a plane which he had been given ; a deal which several thousand landless peasants objected to as they had been denied the use of the land for farming . The ashram was surrounded by barbed wire and the gates were kept locked and guarded . While the Maharishi kept the media away from his famous students , he himself gave interviews to the press . 
 = = Experience = = 
 The Maharishi had arranged a simple lifestyle for his guests , which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting . The days were devoted to meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi , who spoke from a flower @-@ bedecked platform in an auditorium . The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles , nominally due to their late arrival . The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation , relaxation , and away from the media throng – helped the band to relax . Harrison told Saltzman , " Like , we 're The Beatles after all , aren 't we ? We have all the money you could ever dream of . We have all the fame you could ever wish for . But , it isn 't love . It isn 't health . It isn 't peace inside , is it ? " Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him . At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was " amiable but non @-@ talkative " , and during an awkward silence Lennon walked across the room and patted the Maharishi on the head , saying , " There 's a good little guru " while the room erupted in laughter . Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible . One student meditated for 42 straight hours , and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours . Boyd 's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well , but also suffered from dysentery ( misdiagnosed as tonsilitis ) ; she said Lennon also felt unwell , suffering from jet lag and insomnia . The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive . Like the 60 other students at the ashram , the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students . The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men , which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home . 
 Vegetarian meals were eaten in a " communal " dining area , where food was vulnerable to aggressive monkeys and crows . Accounts of the food vary , some calling it spicy while others said it was bland . Lennon described the food as " lousy " , while Pattie Boyd says it was delicious . Menu items included chickpeas mixed with cumin seeds , whole wheat dough baked over a fire , spiced eggplant , potatoes that had been picked locally , and , for breakfast , <unk> , toast and coffee . Starr had problems with the diet because of his past illnesses : " The food was impossible for me , because I 'm allergic to so many different things , so I took two suitcases with me : one of clothes and one of Heinz beans " and eggs . After dinner , the musicians gathered on the roof of Harrison 's bungalow to talk and listen to the Ganges river . Sometimes they listened to records and played guitar or sitar while their wives gathered in one of their rooms and discussed life as the partner of a Beatle . 
 Donovan taught Lennon a guitar finger @-@ picking technique that he passed on to Harrison . The technique was subsequently implemented by Lennon on the Beatles songs " Julia " and " Dear Prudence " . The latter was composed by Lennon to lure Prudence Farrow out of her intense meditation . Lennon later said : " She 'd been locked in for three weeks and was trying to reach God quicker than anyone else " . Another inspiration was hearing for the first time Bob Dylan 's newly released album , John Wesley Harding . The stay at the ashram turned out to be one of the group 's most creative periods . According to Lennon he wrote some of the " most miserable " and some of his " best songs " while he was in Rishikesh . Both Lennon and McCartney often spent time composing rather than meditating , and even Starr wrote a song , " Don 't Pass Me By " , which was his first solo composition . Plans were made for a concert in Delhi to feature the Beatles , the Beach Boys , Donovan , and Paul Horn . Harrison complained that more time should be spent on meditating , saying , " We 're not here to talk about music . We 're here to meditate . " Lennon commented on Harrison 's commitment to meditation by saying : " The way George [ Harrison ] is going , he 'll be flying a magic carpet by the time he 's forty . " 
 While Lennon was " evangelical in his enthusiasm for the Maharishi " , according to his wife , Cynthia , she herself was " a little more sceptical " . Cynthia later wrote that she " loved being in India " and had hoped she and Lennon would " rediscover our lost closeness " ; to her disappointment , however , Lennon became " increasingly cold and aloof " . The Lennons ' room contained a " four @-@ poster bed , a dressing table , a couple of chairs and an electric fire " . Lennon played guitar , while his wife drew pictures and wrote poetry between their long meditation sessions . After two weeks Lennon asked to sleep in a separate room , saying he could only meditate when he was alone . Meanwhile , he walked to the local post office every morning to check for Ono 's almost daily telegrams . One of these telegrams read : " Look up at the sky and when you see a cloud think of me " . 
 = = = Special events = = = 
 The " world press " arrived at the ashram gate and the Maharishi asked them to come back after the Beatles had had " a little time with the course " . According to author and course participant , Cooke de Herrera , the Beatles were " very happy at the way it was done " . De Herrara wrote in her memoir that the Maharishi gave " special attention " to all the celebrities despite her warnings not to feed their egos . Mia Farrow wrote that she felt overwhelmed by the Maharishi 's attention to her , including private sessions , gifts of mangoes , and a birthday party where he gave her a paper crown . Early the following morning the Maharishi arranged for a group photo and told everyone where to sit . Since it was her birthday the day before , Mia was asked to sit in the centre and each student was adorned with a marigold garland . All sat on a podium and the Maharishi had a large picture of his guru , Brahmananda Saraswati , behind him . The photo took half an hour and has been described as " one of the most iconic photographs in the history of rock ' n ' roll " . Photographers included Paul Saltzman , a Canadian filmmaker who was visiting the ashram after completing film work elsewhere in India . Saltzman 's snapshots from this time were later assembled into a book , The Beatles in India ( 2000 ) . 
 The Maharishi celebrated Harrison 's 25th birthday and Harrison played sitar . He gave Harrison an upside @-@ down plastic globe of the world and said : " George , the globe I am giving you symbolizes the world today . I hope you will help us all in the task of putting it right . " Harrison immediately turned the globe to its correct position , shouting , " I 've done it ! " ( Harrison " affectionately " referred to the Maharishi as the " Big M " ) . On 8 April , the Maharishi gave an Indian prince 's outfit to the Lennons for their son in England on his birthday . McCartney was uncomfortable with the Maharishi 's flattery , including calling the band " the blessed leaders of the world 's youth " . 
 An aviation company owner and patron of the Maharishi 's , <unk> <unk> ( K. S. Khambatta ) , flew two helicopters to Rishikesh to take the Maharishi and his guests for rides , for the publicity value , even though the flights required the transportation of fuel by truck to Rishikesh . McCartney asked Lennon why he was so eager to be the one to go with the Maharishi on his helicopter ride , to which Lennon replied , " I thought he 'd slip me the answer . " On another occasion , an Italian newsreel company filmed the Maharishi and many students , including the Beatles and other musicians , going down to the river while the musicians sang standards such as " When the Saints Go Marching In " and " You Are My Sunshine " . One evening , when the moon was full , the Maharishi arranged for everyone to cruise on the Ganges in two barges . The trip started with the chanting of Vedas by two pandits , but soon the musicians brought out their instruments . The Beatles sang Donovan 's songs , while Love and Donovan sang Beatles songs , and Horn played flute . 
 = = Early departures = = 
 Starr 's wife had a strong aversion to insects and McCartney recalled she was once " trapped in her room because there was a fly over the door . " Spiders , mosquitoes and flies were present at the ashram and when Starr complained to the Maharishi he was told : " For people travelling in the realm of pure consciousness , flies no longer matter very much . " Starr found the food " impossible " because he was " allergic to so many different things " and he and his wife left India on 1 March saying " I wouldn 't want anyone to think we didn 't like it there ; " they returned home " because we missed the children . " Their departure was per schedule by one account , but premature by others . McCartney and Asher departed in mid to late March as he needed to get back to London to supervise Apple Corps and she had a theatrical commitment . When he left he told another student , " I 'm a new man " . Alex Mardas arrived after McCartney left , either at Lennon 's invitation or on his own initiative . 
 Mia Farrow , who had come and gone from the ashram before , left again and drifted around India before returning to the United States . Geoffrey Giuliano in Revolver : The Secret History of the Beatles says that , before leaving , she told the Beatles that the Maharishi had made a pass at her . Ned Wynn , one of Farrow 's childhood friends , wrote in his 1990 memoir that she had told him in the early 1970s that the Maharishi had definitely made sexual passes at her . In her 1993 autobiography , Cooke de Herrera wrote that Farrow had confided to her , before the arrival of the Beatles , that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair . Cooke de Herrera wrote that she told Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi 's actions . Farrow 's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous , describing an encounter with the Maharishi in his private meditation " cave " when he tried to put his arms around her . She reports that her sister Prudence told her that it was " an honour " and " a tradition " for a " holy man " to touch someone after meditation . 
 = = = Tensions = = = 
 Business negotiations , allegations of sexual impropriety , alcohol and non @-@ prescription drug use were sources of tension between the Maharishi and the Beatles . Aspinall was surprised when he realised the Maharishi was a sophisticated negotiator , knowing more than the average person about financial percentages . Evans told Saltzman that the Maharishi wanted the band to deposit up to 25 % of their next album 's profits in his Swiss bank account as a tithe , to which Lennon replied , " Over my dead body " . Mardas pointed to the luxury of the facility and the business acumen of the Maharishi and asked Lennon why the Maharishi always had an accountant by his side . Mardas said the Maharishi offered him money to build a high @-@ powered radio station . Lennon later told his wife that he felt that the Maharishi had , in her words , " too much interest in public recognition , celebrities and money " for a spiritual man . According to her sister , Pattie Boyd had dreamt that " the Maharishi wasn 't what he seemed " . Cynthia Lennon , Cooke de Herrera and authors such as Barry Miles have blamed Mardas for turning Lennon against the Maharishi but Mardas denies this . Meanwhile , the weather , which had been quite cool in February , was growing hot and the Maharishi was planning to move the whole group to Kashmir , at a higher and cooler altitude in a week . 
 Some business negotiations concerned arrangements for a film . According to Cooke de Herrera the Maharishi had given the Beatles and their Apple Corporation the rights for a movie about the Maharishi , his movement and his teacher , Guru Dev . While their " people and equipment were on the way " , Charles Lutes , the head of the Maharishi 's Spiritual Regeneration Movement in the US arrived and signed a contract with Four Star Films . The contract was negotiated by Horn and John Farrow was scheduled to direct the film . Horn expected that Donovan , the Beatles , the Beach Boys and Mia Farrow would appear in it . When some of the film crew from Four Star Films arrived around 11 April , Harrison and Lennon stayed out of sight . Cooke de Herrera felt the contract with Four Star Films and presence of the film crew was the reason for the sudden departure of Harrison and Lennon and Horn said it was the catalyst for their discontent . 
 Lennon became convinced that the Maharishi , who said he was celibate , had made a pass at Farrow or was having relations with other young female students and later called the Maharishi a " lecherous womaniser " . According to Mardas an American teacher named Rosalyn Bonas had told both him and Lennon that the Maharishi had made " sexual advances " towards her . However , Cynthia Lennon said she thought Mardas had put the " young and impressionable " girl up to it . Brown recalls that Mardas told him that a young blonde nurse from California had said she 'd had a sexual relationship with the Maharishi . In addition , Mardas arranged to spy on the Maharishi when Bonas was with him , and said that he saw the two of them in a compromising position . At the same time , many of the people who were there , including Harrison , Horn , Cooke de Herrera , Cynthia Lennon and Jennie Boyd did not believe that the Maharishi had made a pass at any woman . According to Cynthia Lennon , Mardas ' allegations about the Maharishi 's indiscretions with a lady gained momentum " without a single shred of evidence or justification . " Likewise McCartney said " It was Magic Alex who made the original accusation and I think that it was completely untrue " . 
 Deepak Chopra , who was not present but later became a disciple of the Maharishi and a friend of Harrison 's , said in 2008 that the Beatles and their entourage " were doing drugs , taking LSD , at Maharishi 's ashram " . An article in the Washington Post reported that " others said the Beatles resumed drug use at the ashram " . The Beatles ' group also violated the Maharishi 's " no alcohol rule " when they consumed " <unk> " which Mardas , who Cynthia thought was not an active meditator , " smuggled in " from a nearby village . 
 = = Later departures = = 
 On the night of 11 April , Lennon , Harrison and Mardas sat up late discussing their views of the Maharishi and decided to leave the next morning . They packed hurriedly , while Mardas went to Dehradun to find taxis . Lennon was chosen to speak to the Maharishi . When asked why they were leaving , Lennon replied " If you 're so cosmic , you 'll know why " . Paul Mason , a biographer of the Maharishi , later interpreted Lennon 's statement as a challenge to the Maharishi 's claim of cosmic consciousness . Lennon said that his mind was made up when the Maharishi gave him a murderous look in response . According to Mardas : " John Lennon and I went to the Maharishi about what had happened ... he asked the Maharishi to explain himself " ; and the Maharishi answered Lennon 's accusation by saying , " I am only human " . But Lennon said he was " a bit rough to him " and the Maharishi responded by saying " I don 't know why , you must tell me . " While waiting for Mardas to return , Lennon wrote the song " Maharishi " , which was later renamed " Sexy Sadie " because Harrison advised Lennon that was potentially libellous . According to Harrison , Lennon " had wanted to leave anyway " and this gave him a " good reason to get out . " 
 According to Cynthia Lennon , when the group walked past the Maharishi on the way to their taxis he looked " very biblical and isolated in his faith " . The Maharishi reportedly said , " Wait , talk to me " . After leaving the ashram , the taxis kept breaking down , leading the Beatles to wonder if the Maharishi had placed a curse on them . The car that the Lennons were in suffered a flat tyre and the driver left them , apparently to find a replacement tyre , but did not return for hours . After it grew dark the Lennons hitchhiked a ride to Delhi and took the first available flight back to London , during which John drunkenly recounted a litany of his numerous infidelities to Cynthia . The Harrisons were not ready to go home , so they travelled to other Indian cities and spent time with Ravi Shankar . Harrison said when he got dysentery he thought it might have been due to a spell cast by the Maharishi , but he recovered after Shankar gave him some amulets . Harrison later said he had never intended to stay for the second half of the course in Kashmir and that he thought Lennon wanted to get back to his relationship with Ono . 
 The departure and split with the Maharishi was well @-@ publicised . In Delhi , Lennon and Harrison told the reporters that they had urgent business in London and they did not want to appear in the Maharishi 's film . Back in the UK the band members said that they were disillusioned by the Maharishi 's desire for financial gain . McCartney said that " Rishikesh was a good experience . I enjoyed it " . Lennon said on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson , " We believe in meditation , but not the Maharishi and his scene " , and , " We made a mistake . He 's human like the rest of us " . Lennon went on to say : " I don 't know what level he 's on but we had a nice holiday in India and came back rested . " 
 According to a 2006 statement by Chopra , the Beatles and their entourage " were doing drugs , taking LSD , at Maharishi 's ashram , and he lost his temper with them . He asked them to leave , and they did in a huff " . A 2008 article in The Washington Post reported that " others said the Beatles resumed drug use at the ashram . " Prudence Farrow stayed with the three @-@ month programme and became a TM teacher , along with 40 other students . Mike Love also became a TM teacher and travelled with the Maharishi to Kashmir later in the year . The trip to India was the last time all four Beatles travelled abroad together . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Philip Goldberg , in his book American Veda : From Emerson and the Beatles to Yoga and Meditation , How Indian Spirituality Changed the West , wrote that the Beatles ' trip to Rishikesh , " may have been the most momentous spiritual retreat since Jesus spent those forty days in the wilderness " . Despite their temporary rejection of the Maharishi , they generated wider interest in Transcendental Meditation , which encouraged the study of Eastern spirituality in Western popular culture . Chopra credits Harrison with spreading TM and other Eastern spiritual practices to America almost single @-@ handedly . 
 After 1968 the Maharishi fell out of the public spotlight for a period and TM was described as a passing fad . Mike Love arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the US during the summer of 1968 . However , the tour was cancelled after several appearances and was called " one of the more bizarre entertainments of the era " . Interest grew again in the mid @-@ 1970s when scientific studies began showing concrete results . The Maharishi moved to Europe in the early years of that decade and appeared twice on American television 's The Merv Griffin Show in the mid 1970s , leading to a surge of popularity called the " Merv wave " . That was followed by the introduction of " Yogic Flying " , a technique which offered the promise of levitation . In a 1975 interview , Harrison said of the Beatles ' association with Transcendental Meditation : " In retrospect , that was probably one of the greatest experiences I 've ever had … Maharishi was always put down for propagating what was basically a spiritual thing but there 's so much being propagated that 's damaging to life that I ’ m glad there are good people around like him . " In 1978 Lennon wrote that he considered his meditation a " source of creative inspiration " . 
 In her 2005 book Gurus in America , author Cynthia Ann Humes comments that although the " public falling out " between the Beatles and Maharishi was widely reported , there has been " little mention " of " the continued positive relationship Maharishi maintained " with Harrison and McCartney . During the 1990s both Harrison and McCartney were so convinced of the Maharishi 's innocence that they offered their apologies . Harrison gave a benefit concert for the Maharishi @-@ associated Natural Law Party in 1992 , and later apologised for the way the Maharishi had been treated by saying , " We were very young " and " It 's probably in the history books that Maharishi ' tried to attack Mia Farrow ' – but it 's bullshit , total bullshit . " Cynthia Lennon wrote in 2006 that she " hated leaving on a note of discord and mistrust , when we had enjoyed so much kindness from the Maharishi " . Asked if he forgave the Beatles , the Maharishi replied , " I could never be upset with angels . " McCartney took his daughter , Stella , to visit the Maharishi in the Netherlands in 2007 , which renewed their friendship . 
 By the time of the Maharishi 's death in 2008 , more than 5 million people had learned Transcendental Meditation , and his world @-@ wide movement was valued in the billions of dollars . The ashram , built on land belonging to the Rajaji National Park , was reclaimed by the government in the mid @-@ 1990s after the lease expired in 1981 , and fell into disrepair . After the Maharishi died , McCartney said : " my memories of him will only be joyful ones . He was a great man who worked tirelessly for the people of the world and the cause of unity " . Starr said in 2008 , " I feel so blessed I met the Maharishi – he gave me a mantra that no one can take away , and I still use it " . In 2009 , McCartney , Starr , Donovan , and Horn reunited at a concert held at New York 's Radio City Music Hall to benefit the David Lynch Foundation , which funds the teaching of Transcendental Meditation in schools . A 2008 article in Rolling Stone magazine reported Yoko Ono as saying : " John would have been the first one now , if he had been here , to recognize and acknowledge what Maharishi has done for the world and appreciate it " . Author Gary Tillery wrote in 2010 that Lennon " benefited from the experience " and " for the rest of his life he often turned to meditation to restore himself and improve his creativity . " 
 In 2011 , a 1967 letter surfaced in which Lennon wrote to a fan saying the Beatles " were lucky to have met " the Maharishi . A 2011 article in The Telegraph reported Harrison as saying : " Maharishi only ever did good for us , and although I have not been with him physically , I never left him " . In 2007 , a Canadian actress , Maggie Blue O 'Hara , announced plans to renovate and convert the property into a home for the street children of New Delhi . In 2011 , a plan was announced by the state government to build an <unk> Gram on the site . In 2003 , Jerry Hall produced a series for the BBC titled Gurus , which included interviews with TM initiates , Jagger , and Cooke de Herrera , and a visit to the ashram in Rishikesh . Saltzman 's photographs at the ashram have subsequently been displayed in galleries worldwide , published in two books and in a permanent exhibition above the retail units in the departure lounge of Liverpool John Lennon Airport . Mira Nair began work on a documentary film about the Beatles ' visit to India ; although no date for the film release has been announced . 
 = = = Songs = = = 
 The Beatles wrote many songs during their visit to Rishikesh : 30 by one count , and " 48 songs in seven weeks " by others . Lennon said : " We wrote about thirty new songs between us . Paul must have done about a dozen . George says he 's got six , and I wrote fifteen " . Many of the songs became part of the album The Beatles ( aka " the White Album " ) , while others appeared on Abbey Road , and solo records . Several of the songs contained Eastern musical influences .

 = = = Filming = = = 
 Although there was talk of making a film about the Maharishi in co @-@ operation with Apple Films , it was discovered that the Maharishi was independently negotiating with ABC Television in the US , to create a TV special featuring the band . Two visits by business manager Peter Brown to the Maharishi — who was lecturing in Malmö , Sweden — and one by Harrison and McCartney , failed to stop him proclaiming that he could deliver the band for a TV show . 
 A film crew led by producer Gene Corman – linked to ABC Television – did eventually arrive to film proceedings , but within a day of their arrival the remaining Beatles had left ; Upon returning to England , Lennon dismissed the idea that the presence of the film crew had contributed to the timing of their exit . 
 Video footage of the Beatles ' stay does exist , sourced from a 16mm silent handheld camera that was used by many of the guests during their stay there . Segments of this can be seen in the documentary The Beatles Anthology . 
 = Old Bacon Academy = 
 The Bacon Academy , nicknamed Old Bacon Academy , was the original Bacon Academy until 1993 . The Old Bacon Academy was built in 1803 and is located at 84 Main Street , Colchester , Connecticut . The main structure is a 70 feet ( 21 m ) long by 34 feet ( 10 m ) wide three @-@ story Flemish bond brick structure with Federal style details . Noted for its plain , utilitarian floor plan consisting of two rooms off a central hall and stairway , the inside has seen some renovations throughout its history . The Day Hall , a contributing property purchased by the Bacon Academy trustees in 1929 , is a church hall that was used for the high school until 1962 . 
 Originally operating as a white male school , Bacon Academy integrated " negroes and persons of color " around 1833 and began to educate women in 1842 . The school has educated important figures like Edwin Denison Morgan , Morgan Bulkeley , William A. Buckingham , Lyman Trumbull , and Morrison Waite . Due to the structure 's utilitarian style combined with its Federal details , the National Register of Historic Places recognizes it as architecturally significant . Currently , the Old Bacon Academy building is used as part of an alternative education program and Day Hall is used as a nursery . The properties were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Bacon Academy is named for Pierpoint Bacon , a prosperous farmer who died childless in 1800 . Bacon bequeathed most of his property and assets to the First Society of Colchester to support schooling . The trustees decided to build an academy , an institution to have young men be educated , and then go directly into the workforce . Completed in 1803 for the cost of $ 7000 , the main Bacon Academy structure is a 70 feet ( 21 m ) long by 34 feet ( 10 m ) wide three @-@ story Flemish bond brick structure with Federal style details . The foundation of the academy is made of fieldstone with a facing of dressed granite blocks . The bricks were produced on a local farm for the purpose building Bacon Academy . The front facade has 26 windows arranged in 9 bays with gaps for the chimneys in between the second and third bay from the corners . The sash is 6 @-@ by @-@ 6 and was noted to appear original in the nomination form . Originally the hipped roof had four chimneys , with two matching chimneys on each the west and east sides . Only the east chimneys remain . Facing the front entrance , the chimneys are spaced about 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) from the side corners . In the 1982 nomination , the hipped roof was reported to have asphalt shingles . 
 The building was altered in 1890 , with two additions of Victorian architecture , the first being the main entrance , above the fanlight , is an arched awning with incised consoles . The other addition was the octagonal cupola on the roof over the original bell tower which dates from 1830 . The exterior of the school has complementary colors . The walls are painted a cream color while the foundation , doors , window trims , and cornices are a chocolate @-@ brown . 
 The interior of the building was termed " severely plain " and utilitarian for its simple design of two large rooms on each side with a central hall and stairwell . Each room was filled with natural light from the windows , and had a chimney for the iron stoves on the east and west ends of the building . The oak floors were installed in the early 20th @-@ century and the ceiling was covered with modern acoustical tiles . The third floor is a shallow attic that gives access to the cupola . The ceiling and roof framing is supported with two king @-@ post trusses at the ends of the main ridge . The basement is divided into halves and supported by summer beams that run the length of the sills and supported by posts on stone pedestals . By 1982 , the steel I @-@ beams were " recently " inserted under the floor joists and between the summer and the sills . The cellar also has an old furnace that is not in service due to the building using electrical heating . 
 The other contributing property , Day Hall , is a church hall that was originally built in 1858 . It was acquired and used for " high school purposes " from 1929 until they completed construction of the new Bacon Academy in 1962 . After that it was adopted for use as a kindergarten and offices for the trustees . Described as " vaguely Italianate " , the one @-@ room church hall has a basement and a T @-@ shaped addition dating to around 1928 . It has a steep gabled , hipped roof . The entrance has two modern fire doors that lead to an auditorium and gallery on the east and stage on the west end .

 The school was originally only for white male students , with " negroes and persons of color " using a separate facility , but integration occurred thirty years later and the school also began to educate women in 1842 . Throughout the first 136 years of Bacon Academy 's operation its endowment was its sole provider of funding . In 1939 , the town began contributing funds to the institution , resulting in the loss of complete control of its own affairs . In 1982 , at the time of its National Register of Historic Places nomination , the trust provided a " small percentage " of Bacon Academy 's funding . 
 In 2013 , the Bacon Academy building was used by the school as part of an alternative education program and Day Hall functions as a nursery school . The school is rented by the Board of Education for around $ 21 @,@ 000 a year and the Bacon Academy Board of Trustees says that the operational costs are between $ 25 @,@ 000 and $ 28 @,@ 000 a year .

 = Early history of video games = 
 The history of video games spans a period of time between the invention of the first electronic games and today , covering a long period of invention and changes . Video gaming would not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s , when arcade video games , gaming consoles and home computer games were introduced to the general public . Since then , video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern culture in most parts of the world . The early history of video games , therefore , covers the period of time between the first interactive electronic game with an electronic display in 1947 , the first true video games in the early 1950s , and the rise of early arcade video games in the 1970s ( Pong and the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles with the Magnavox Odyssey , both in 1972 ) . During this time there were a wide range of devices and inventions corresponding with large advances in computing technology , and the actual first video game is dependent on the definition of " video game " used . 
 Following the 1947 invention of the cathode @-@ ray tube amusement device , the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to use an electronic display , the first true video games were created in the early 1950s . Initially created as technology demonstrations , such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951 , video games also became the purview of academic research . A series of games , generally simulating real @-@ world board games , were created at various research institutions to explore programming , human – computer interaction , and computer algorithms . These include OXO and Christopher Strachey 's draughts program in 1952 , the first software @-@ based games to incorporate a CRT display , and several chess and checkers programs . Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958 's Tennis for Two , featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope . As computing technology improved over time , computers became smaller and faster , and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students by the end of the 1950s . These new programmers began to create games for non @-@ academic purposes , leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar ! as one of the earliest known digital computer games to be available outside a single research institute . 
 Throughout the rest of the 1960s , digital computer games were created by increasingly numerous programmers and sometimes sold commercially in catalogs . As the audience for video games expanded to more than a few dozen research institutions with the falling cost of computers , and programming languages that would run on multiple types of computers were created , a wider variety of games began to be developed . Video games transitioned into a new era in the early 1970s with the launch of the commercial video game industry with the display of the coin @-@ operated arcade game Galaxy Game and the release first widely available arcade game Computer Space , and then in 1972 with the release of the immensely successful arcade game Pong and the first home video game console , the Magnavox Odyssey , which launched the first generation of video game consoles . 
 = = Defining the video game = = 
 The term " video game " has evolved over the decades from a purely technical definition to a general concept defining a new class of interactive entertainment . Technically , for a product to be a video game , there must be a video signal transmitted to a cathode ray tube ( CRT ) that creates a <unk> image on a screen . This definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results to a printer or teletype rather than a display , any game rendered on a vector @-@ scan monitor , any game played on a modern high definition display , and most handheld game systems . From a technical standpoint , these would more properly be called " electronic games " or " computer games " . 
 Today , however , the term " video game " has completely shed its purely technical definition and encompasses a wider range of technology . While still rather ill @-@ defined , the term " video game " now generally encompasses any game played on hardware built with electronic logic circuits that incorporates an element of interactivity and outputs the results of the player 's actions to a display . Going by this broader definition , the first video games appeared in the early 1950s ; they were tied largely to research projects at universities and large corporations , though , and had little influence on each other due to their primary purpose as academic and promotional devices rather than entertainment games . 
 The ancestors to these games include the cathode @-@ ray tube amusement device , the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen . The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope , with a set of knobs and switches . The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program . It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith , Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947 . While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers , as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories , the patent , the first for an electronic game , was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes . This , along with the lack of electronic logic circuits , keeps the device from being considered the first video game . Around the same time as the device was invented , the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948 , a chess simulation called <unk> , though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time . Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent , but was never able to run the program on a computer . 
 = = Initial games = = 
 The first publicly demonstrated electronic game was created in 1950 . Bertie the Brain was an arcade game of tic @-@ tac @-@ toe , built by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition . To showcase his new miniature vacuum tube , the additron tube , he designed a specialized computer to use it , which he built with the assistance of engineers from Rogers Majestic . The large metal computer , which was four meters tall , could only play tic @-@ tac @-@ toe on a lightbulb @-@ backed display , and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from August 25 – September 9 , 1950 . The game was a success at the two @-@ week exhibition , with attendees lining up to play it as Kates adjusted the difficulty up and down for players . After the exhibition , Bertie was dismantled , and " largely forgotten " as a novelty . Kates has said that he was working on so many projects at the same time that he had no energy to spare for preserving it , despite its significance . 
 Nearly a year later on May 5 , 1951 , the Nimrod computer — created by engineering firm and nascent computer developer Ferranti — was presented at the Festival of Britain , and then showcased for three weeks in October at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled . Using a panel of lights for its display , it was designed exclusively to play the game of Nim ; moves were made by players pressing buttons which corresponded with the lights . Nimrod could play either the traditional or " reverse " form of the game . The machine was twelve feet wide , nine feet deep , and five feet tall . It was based on an earlier Nim @-@ playing machine , " Nimatron " , designed by Edward Condon and built by Westinghouse Electric in 1940 for display at the New York World 's Fair . " Nimatron " had been constructed from electromechanical relays and weighed over a ton . The Nimrod was primarily intended to showcase Ferranti 's computer design and programming skills rather than entertain , and was not followed up by any future games . Despite this , most of the onlookers at the Festival of Britain were more interested in playing the game than in the programming and engineering logic behind it . 
 Around this time , non @-@ visual games were being developed at various research computer laboratories ; for example , Christopher Strachey developed a simulation of the game draughts , or checkers , for the Pilot ACE that he unsuccessfully attempted to run for the first time in July 1951 at the British National Physical Laboratory and completed in 1952 ; this is the first known computer game to be created for a general @-@ purpose computer , rather than a machine specifically made for the game like Bertie . Strachey 's program inspired Arthur Samuel to develop his own checkers game in 1952 for the IBM 701 ; successive iterations developed rudimentary artificial intelligence by 1955 and a version was shown on television in 1956 . Also in 1951 , Dietrich Prinz wrote the first limited program of chess for the University of Manchester 's general @-@ purpose Ferranti Mark 1 computer , one of the first commercially available computers . The program was only capable of computing " mate @-@ in @-@ two " problems as it was not powerful enough to play a full game , and it had no video output . Around the same time in the early 1950s , the RAND Corporation developed a series of combat simulation games of increasing complexity , where the player would enter orders to intercept enemy aircraft , or set up their forces to counter an enemy army invasion . These simulations were not yet true video games , as they required human intervention to interpret the player 's orders and the final results ; the computer only controlled the paths that the enemies would take . 
 = = Interactive visual games = = 
 In 1952 , Alexander S. Douglas created OXO , a software program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator ( EDSAC ) computer , which simulates a game of tic @-@ tac @-@ toe . The EDSAC was one of the first stored @-@ program computers , with memory that could be read from or written to , and filled an entire room ; it included three 35 × 16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer 's memory . As a part of a thesis on human – computer interaction , Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user ; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game . The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller , selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next . Their move would appear on the screen , and then the computer 's move would follow . The game was not available to the general public , and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge 's Mathematical Laboratory , by special permission , as the EDSAC could not be moved . Like other early video games , after serving Douglas 's purpose , the game was discarded . Around the same time , Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer , the Manchester Mark 1 , culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952 , which had a CRT display . Like OXO , the display was mostly static , updating only when a move was made . OXO and Strachey 's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen . 
 The first known game incorporating graphics that updated in real time , rather than only when the player made a move , was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for a demonstration of the University of Michigan @-@ developed <unk> computer at the University of Michigan in 1954 . The game , developed over six months by the pair , featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob , and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view . The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table , disappearing when they reached a pocket , and updated the graphics continuously , forty times a second , so as to show real @-@ time motion . Like previous video games , the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the <unk> computer . 
 While further games like checkers and chess were developed on research computers , the next milestone in video games came in 1958 with Tennis for Two . Perhaps the first game created solely for entertainment rather than as a technology demonstration or a research tool , the program simulated a game of tennis . Created by American physicist William Higinbotham for visitors at the Brookhaven National Laboratory to be more entertaining for visitors on their public day than the usual static exhibits about nuclear power , the game ran on a Donner Model 30 analog computer and displayed a side view of a tennis court on an oscilloscope . The players controlled the angle of their shots with attached controllers , and the game calculated and simulated the trajectory of the ball , including the possibility of hitting the net . The game was first shown on October 18 , 1958 . Hundreds of visitors lined up to play the new game during its debut . Due to the game 's popularity , an upgraded version was shown the following year , with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity . Afterwards , having served its purpose , the game was dismantled for its component parts . While the game had no innovations in game design or technological development , its status as an entertainment @-@ focused game , rather than an academic project or technological showpiece , has led it to be considered one of the first " real " video games as they are generally thought of today . 
 Over the next few years , during 1957 – 61 , various computer games continued to be created in the context of academic computer and programming research , particularly as computer technology improved to include smaller , transistor @-@ based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time , rather than operations run in batches . A few programs , however , while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products ; these were generally created by undergraduate students , such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX @-@ 0 experimental computer . These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers , many of them students affiliated with the Tech Model Railroad Club ( TMRC ) led by Alan Kotok , Peter Samson , and Bob Saunders . The games included Tic @-@ Tac @-@ Toe , which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer , and Mouse in the Maze . Mouse in the Maze allowed users to use a light pen to set up a maze of walls on the monitor , and spots that represented bits of cheese or glasses of martini . A virtual mouse was then released and would traverse the maze to find the objects . Additionally , the wargame simulations from the early 1950s by the RAND Corporation had expanded into more complicated simulations which required little human intervention , and had also sparked the creation of business management simulation games such as The Management Game , which was used in business schools such as at Carnegie Mellon University by 1958 . By 1961 , there were over 89 different business simulation games in use , with various graphical capabilities . As the decade ended , despite several video games having been developed , there was no such thing as a commercial video game industry ; almost all games had been developed on or as a single machine for specific purposes , and the few simulation games were neither commercial nor for entertainment . 
 = = The spread of games = = 
 By 1961 , MIT had acquired the DEC PDP @-@ 1 minicomputer , the successor to the TX @-@ 0 , which also used a vector display system . The system 's comparatively small size and processing speed meant that , like with the TX @-@ 0 , the university allowed its undergraduate students and employees to write programs for the computer which were not directly academically related whenever it was not in use . In 1961 @-@ 62 , Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz , Steve Russell , and Wayne Wiitanen created the game Spacewar ! on the PDP @-@ 1 , inspired by science fiction books such as the <unk> series . The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer installations in American academic institutions , making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute . 
 The two @-@ player game has the players engaged in a dogfight between two spaceships set against the backdrop of a randomly generated background starfield . The game was developed to meet three precepts : to use as much of the computer 's resources as possible , to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different , and to be entertaining and therefore a game . The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship . After the game 's initial development , members of the TMRC worked to improve the game , adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body , and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP @-@ 1 , a process which continued over the next few years . As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time , Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device , essentially an early gamepad . Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP @-@ 1 systems before shipping , since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware . Although the game was widespread for the era , it was still very limited in its direct reach : the PDP @-@ 1 was priced at US $ 120 @,@ 000 and only 55 were ever sold , many without a monitor , which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow , academic audience . Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games . 
 Although the market for commercial games — and software in general — was small , due to the cost of computers limiting their spread to research institutions and large corporations , several were still created by programmers and distributed by the computer manufacturers . A number of games could be found in an April 1962 IBM program catalog . These included board games , " BBC Vik The Baseball <unk> " , and " Three Dimensional Tic @-@ Tack @-@ Toe " . Following the spread of Spacewar , further computer games developed by programmers at universities were also developed and distributed over the next few years . These included the Socratic System , a question and answer game designed to teach medical students how to diagnose patients by Wallace <unk> in 1962 , and a dice game by Edward Steinberger in 1965 . 
 The creation of general programming languages like BASIC , which could be run on different hardware types , allowed for programs to be written for more than one specific computer , in turn letting games written in them to spread to more end players in the programming community than before . These games included a baseball simulation game written in BASIC by John Kemeny in 1965 ; a BASIC bingo game by Larry Bethurum in 1966 ; a basketball simulation game written in BASIC by Charles R. Bacheller in May 1967 ; another baseball game that simulates the 1967 World Series written in BASIC by Jacob Bergmann in August 1967 ; Space Travel , written by Ken Thompson for a Multics system in 1969 and which led in part to the development of the Unix operating system ; and Hamurabi , a text @-@ based FOCAL game written by Doug Dyment in 1968 and converted to BASIC by David H. Ahl in 1969 , and one of the first strategy video games ever made . Hamurabi and Space Travel were among several early mainframe games that were written during the time , and spread beyond their initial mainframe computers to general @-@ purpose languages like BASIC . 
 = = A new industry = = 
 At the beginning of the 1970s , video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers , primarily at research institutions and large companies . The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade , however , with the rise of the commercial video game industry . In 1971 , Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin @-@ operated computer game , Galaxy Game , at Stanford University using a DEC PDP @-@ 11 computer with vector displays . The pair was inspired to make the game by Spacewar ; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin @-@ operated version of the game would be very successful . Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers , but in 1969 DEC released the PDP @-@ 11 for US $ 20 @,@ 000 ; while this was still too high for a commercially viable product , as most games in arcades cost around US $ 1 @,@ 000 at the time , the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per @-@ game pricing . Only prototype units were ever built , though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once ; after its initial installation at Stanford in September 1971 , the pair met with Nolan Bushnell , who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price . 
 That game was Computer Space , developed by Bushnell and Ted Dabney . They had found the Data General Nova , a US $ 4 @,@ 000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once ; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project . While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose @-@ built hardware , however , the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game , rather than general programs , would be much less expensive : as low as $ 100 . By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck , a prototype version had been successfully displayed for a short time in August 1971 in a local bar , the design was nearly finished , and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy . Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game , Nutting Associates , who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors . Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space , due to its high price . Pitts and Tuck believed , however , that despite the economic argument their game was superior , as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar , while Computer Space just a pale imitation . Some players at the time , however , believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar ! . Galaxy Game 's prototype installation was very popular , though at a low price @-@ per @-@ game , and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location ; they were never able to enter production , though , as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US $ 65 @,@ 000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan . 
 Two months after Galaxy Game 's installation , Computer Space was released . It was the first coin @-@ operated video game to be commercially sold ( and the first widely available video game of any kind ) . While it did well in its initial locations near college campuses , it performed very poorly in bars and arcades where pinball and other arcade games were typically placed ; while it was commercially successful and made over US $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , it did not meet the high expectations of Nutting , who had expected to sell more than 1 @,@ 500 units . Bushnell and Dabney immediately started work on another game , using the same television set design as Computer Space , as well as founding their own company Atari , Inc. to back their projects . While initially this game was to be a driving game that Bushnell planned to design , their first employee , Allan Alcorn , took a prototype ping @-@ pong game suggestion of Bushnell 's and expanded on it to create a game the company immediately seized on . They were unable to find a manufacturer , but on the evidence of the success of their prototype installation , decided to produce the game cabinets themselves . Pong was released in 1972 , a year after Computer Space . It was immensely commercially successful , selling over 8 @,@ 000 units . It inspired copycat games to be sold in America , Europe , and Japan , and led to the popularization of the medium . 
 That same year saw the release of the Magnavox Odyssey , the first home video game console which could be connected to a television set . The inventor , Ralph H. Baer , had initially had the idea in 1951 to make an interactive game on a television set . Unable to do so with the technological constraints at the time , he began work on a device that would attach to a television set and display games in 1966 , and the " Brown Box " , the last prototype of seven , was licensed to Magnavox to adapt and produce . They announced the console in May 1972 , and it went on sale that September . The console and its games featured numerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers : it was the first game to use a raster @-@ scan video display , or television set , directly displayed via modification of a video signal ; it was also the first video gaming device to be displayed in a television commercial . It sold for US $ 100 and shipped with several games , including " Table tennis " , which Bushnell had seen a demo of and which Pong had been based on . The Odyssey sold over 100 @,@ 000 units in 1972 , and more than 350 @,@ 000 by the end of 1975 , buoyed by the popularity of the table tennis game , in turn driven by the success of Pong . Pong and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming , with numerous other competitors starting up in the video game industry as it grew in popularity . 
 = Military of Mycenaean Greece = 
 The military nature of Mycenaean Greece ( c . 1600 – 1100 BC ) in the Late Bronze Age is evident by the numerous weapons unearthed , warrior and combat representations in contemporary art , as well as by the preserved Greek Linear B records . The Mycenaeans invested in the development of military infrastructure with military production and logistics being supervised directly from the palatial centres . This militaristic ethos inspired later Ancient Greek tradition , and especially Homer 's epics , which are focused on the heroic nature of the Mycenaean @-@ era warrior élite . 
 Late Bronze Age Greece was divided into a series of warrior kingdoms , the most important being centered in Mycenae , to which the culture of this era owes its name , Tiryns , Pylos and Thebes . From the 15th century BC , Mycenaean power began expanding towards the Aegean , the Anatolian coast and Cyprus . Mycenaean armies shared several common features with other contemporary Late Bronze Age powers : they were initially based on heavy infantry , with spears , large shields and in some occasions armor . In the 13th century BC , Mycenaean units underwent a transformation in tactics and weaponry and became more uniform and flexible and their weapons became smaller and lighter . Some representative types of Mycenaean armor / weapons were the boar 's tusk helmet and the " Figure @-@ of @-@ eight " shield . Moreover , most features of the later hoplite panoply of Classical Greece were already known at this time . 
 = = Military ethos = = 
 The presence of the important and influential military aristocracy that formed in Mycenaean society offers an overwhelming impression of a fierce and warlike people . This impression of militarism is reinforced by the fortifications erected throughout Mycenaean Greece , the large numbers and quality of the weapons retrieved from the Mycenaean royal graves , artistic representations of war scenes and the textual evidence provided by the Linear B records . The Linear B scripts also offer some detail about the organization of the military personnel , while military production and logistics were supervised by a central authority from the palaces . According to the records in the palace of Pylos , every rural community ( the damos ) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army ; similar service was also performed by the aristocracy . 
 The main divinities who appear to be of warlike nature were Ares ( Linear B : A @-@ re ) and Athena <unk> ( Linear B : A @-@ ta @-@ na Po @-@ ti @-@ ni @-@ ja ) . 
 = = Tactics and evolution = = 
 Mycenaean armies shared several common features with other significant Late Bronze Age powers : they were initially based on heavy infantry , which bore spears , large shields and , in some occasions , armor . Later in the 13th century BC , Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry . Armed units became more uniform and flexible , while weapons became smaller and lighter . The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors until the collapse of the Bronze Age , while the sword played a secondary role in combat . 
 The precise role and contribution of war chariots in battlefield is a matter of dispute due to the lack of sufficient evidence . In general , it appears that during the first centuries ( 16th – 14th century BC ) chariots were used as a fighting vehicle while later in the 13th century BC their role was limited to a battlefield transport . Horse @-@ mounted warriors were also part of the Mycenaean armies , however their precise role isn 't clear due to lack of archaeological data . 
 = = Fortifications = = 
 The construction of defensive structures was closely linked with the establishment of the palatial centers in mainland Greece . The principal Mycenaean centers were well @-@ fortified and usually situated on an elevated terrain , such as in Athens , Tiryns and Mycenae or on coastal plains , in the case of Gla . Mycenaean Greeks appreciated the symbolism of war as expressed in defensive architecture , thus they aimed also at the visual impressiveness of their fortifications . The walls were built in Cyclopean style ; consisted of walls built of large , unworked boulders more than 8 m ( 26 ft ) thick and weighing several metric tonnes . The term Cyclopean was derived by the Greeks of the classical era who believed that only the mythical giants , the Cyclops , could have constructed such megalithic structures . On the other hand , cut stone masonry is used only in and around gateways . 
 = = Weaponry = = 
 = = = Offensive weapons = = = 
 Spears were initially long and two @-@ handed , more than 3 m ( 10 ft ) long and possibly handled with both hands . During the later Mycenaean centuries , shorter versions were adopted which were usually accompanied with small types of shields , mainly of circular shape . These short spears have been used for both thrusting and throwing . 
 From the 16th century BC , swords with rounded tips appeared , having a grip which was an extension of the blade . They were 130 cm ( 4 ft ) long and 3 cm ( 1 in ) broad . Another type , the single @-@ edged sword was a solid piece of bronze c . 66 cm ( 2 @.@ 17 ft ) – 74 cm ( 2 @.@ 43 ft ) long . This shorter sword was most probably used for close @-@ quarters combat . In the 14th century BC , both types were progressively modified with stronger grips and shorter blades . Finally in the 13th century BC , a new type of sword , the <unk> II , became popular in Mycenaean Greece . 
 Archery was commonly used from an early period in battlefield . Other offensive weapons used were maces , axes , slings and javelins . 
 = = = Shields = = = 
 Early Mycenaean armies used " tower shields " , large shields that covered almost the entire body . However , with the introduction of bronze armor , this type was less utilized , even if it didn 't completely go into disuse , as attested in iconography . " Figure @-@ of @-@ eight " shields became the most common type of Mycenaean shields . These shields were made of several layers of bull @-@ hide and in some cases they were reinforced with bronze plates . During the later Mycenaean period , smaller types of shields were adopted . They were either of completely circular shape , or almost circular with a cut @-@ out part from their lower edge . These were made of several layers of leather with a bronze boss and reinforcements . They occasionally appear to have been made entirely of bronze . 
 = = = Helmets = = = 
 The most common type of Mycenaean helmet is the conical one reinforced with rows of boar tusks . This type was widely used and became the most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor , being in use from the beginning to the collapse of Mycenaean culture . It is also known from several depictions in contemporary art in Greece and the Mediterranean . Boar 's tusk helmets consisted of a felt @-@ lined leather cap , with several rows of cut boar 's tusk sewn onto it . 
 Helmets made entirely of bronze were also used , while some of them had large cheek guards , probably stitched or riveted to the helmet , as well as an upper pierced knot to hold a crest . Small holes all around the cheek guards and the helmet 's lower edge were used for the attachment of internal padding . Other types of bronze helmets were also used . During the late Mycenaean period , additional types were also used such as horned helmets made of strips of leather . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 A representative piece of Mycenaean armor is the Dendra panoply ( c . 1450 – 1400 BC ) which consisted of a cuirass of a complete set made up of several elements of bronze . It was flexible and comfortable enough to be used for fighting on foot , while the total weight of the armor is around 18 kg ( about 40 lb ) . Important evidence of Mycenaean armor has also been found in Thebes ( c . 1350 – 1250 BC ) , which include a pair of shoulder guards , smaller than to those from Dendra , with additional plates protecting the upper arms , attached to the lower edge of the shoulder guards . 
 The use of scale armour is evident during the later Mycenaean centuries , as shown on iconography and archaeological finds . In general , most features of the later hoplite panoply of classical Greek antiquity , were already known to Mycenaean Greece . 
 = = Chariots = = 
 The two @-@ horse chariot appeared on the Greek mainland at least from the 16th century BC . Mycenaean chariots differed from their counterparts used by contemporary Middle Eastern powers . According to the preserved Linear B records , the palatial states of Knossos and Pylos were able to field several hundreds . The most common type of Mycenaean chariot was the " dual chariot " , which appeared in the middle of the 15th century BC . In 14th century BC , a lighter version appeared , the " rail chariot " , which featured an open cab and was most probably used as a battlefield transport rather than a fighting vehicle . 
 = = Ships = = 
 Mycenaean ships were shallow @-@ draught vessels and could be beached on sandy bays . There were vessels of various sizes containing different numbers of oarsmen . The largest ship probably had a crew of 42 – 46 oarsmen , with one steering oar , a captain , two attendants and a complement of warriors . 
 The most common type of Mycenaean vessel based on depictions of contemporary art was the oared galley with long and narrow hulls . The shape of the hull was constructed in a way to maximize the number of rowers . Thus , a higher speed could have been achieved regardless of wind conditions . Although it carried mast and sail , it was less efficient as a sailing ship . The Mycenaean galley offered certain advantages . Although lighter compared to the oared @-@ sailing ship of the Minoans of Crete , it seated more rowers . Its steering mechanism was a triangular steering oar , a forerunner of the latter steering oar of Archaic era . 
 = = Campaigns = = 
 Around 1450 BC , Greece was divided into a series of warrior kingdoms , the most important being centered in Mycenae , Tiryns , Pylos and Thebes . Before the end of the same century , this militaristic civilization replaced the former priestess @-@ dominated civilization of Minoan Cretans in the Aegean . Thus , the Mycenaeans began to build up their maritime power in the Aegean Sea , expanding towards the Aegean Islands and Anatolian coast . The warlike nature of the Mycenaeans was probably a decisive factor in their diplomatic relations towards the other Late Bronze Age powers . Mycenaean warriors were also hired as mercenaries in foreign armies , such as in Egypt . 
 Contemporary Hittite texts indicate the presence of Ahhiyawa , which strengthened its position in western Anatolia from c . 1400 to c . 1220 BC . Ahhiyawa is generally accepted as a Hittite translation of Mycenaean Greece ( Achaeans in Homeric Greek ) . During this period , the kings of Ahhiyawa were clearly able to deal with the Hittite kings both in a military and diplomatic way . Ahhiyawa activity was to interfere in Anatolian affairs , with the support of anti @-@ Hittite uprisings or through local vassal rulers , which the king of the Ahhiyawa used as agents for the extension of his influence . In one occasion , in c . 1400 BC , Attarsiya ( a possible Hittite translation of Atreus ) launched a campaign deploying an army headed by war chariots and attacked regions which were under Hittite influence . Later , Attarsiya , invaded the island of <unk> ( Cyprus ) together with a number of his Anatolian allies . The invading force finally succeeded in controlling the island and overthrowing the local Hittite authorities . The campaigns of Attarsiya represent the earliest recorded Mycenaean Greek military activity against the Hittites . The Hittite @-@ Ahhiyawan confrontation in Wilusa , the Hittite name for Troy , in the 13th century BC may have provided the historical foundation for the Trojan War tradition . 
 In circa 1250 BC , the first wave of destruction has been witnessed in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists . These incidents appear to have triggered the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites . In some cases , arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns . Nevertheless , none of these measures appear to have prevented the final destruction of the Mycenaean palace centers in the 12th century BC . The reasons that lead to the collapse of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars . The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Due to the information offered by the Greek epics and especially by Homer 's epics , the Iliad and Odyssey , this time period of Greek history was regarded as a period of warrior @-@ heroes who led various military campaigns in Greece and adjacent areas . The picture of the Mycenaean Greeks in the Homeric Epics is one of a quarrelsome people and of a warrior élite to whom personal honor was the highest value . 
 = The Chronicles of Narnia : Prince Caspian = 
 The Chronicles of Narnia : Prince Caspian is a 2008 American high fantasy film based on Prince Caspian , the second published , fourth chronological novel in C. S. Lewis 's epic fantasy series , The Chronicles of Narnia . It is the second in The Chronicles of Narnia film series from Walden Media , following The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ( 2005 ) . The four Pevensie children ( William Moseley , Anna Popplewell , Skandar Keynes , and Georgie Henley ) return to Narnia to aid Prince Caspian ( Ben Barnes ) in his struggle for the throne against his corrupt uncle , King Miraz ( Sergio Castellitto ) . The film was released on May 16 , 2008 in the United States and on June 26 , 2008 in the United Kingdom . The screenplay based on the novel by C. S. Lewis was written by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus . 
 Prince Caspian is also the last Narnia film to be co @-@ produced by Walt Disney Pictures , as 20th Century Fox became the distributor of its future films starting with The Chronicles of Narnia : The Voyage of the Dawn Treader . Work on the script began before The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe was released , so filming could begin before the actors grew too old for their parts . Director Andrew Adamson wanted to make the film more spectacular than the first , and created an action sequence not in the novel . The Narnians were designed to look wilder as they have been hiding from persecution , stressing the darker tone of the sequel . The filmmakers also took a Spanish influence for the antagonistic race of the Telmarines . Filming began in February 2007 in New Zealand , but unlike the previous film , the majority of shooting took place in Central Europe , because of the larger sets available in those countries . To keep costs down , Adamson chose to base post @-@ production in the UK , because of recent tax credits there . 
 The film was a moderate success in the United States and Canada with a total sum of $ 141 <unk> and $ 278 million in the rest of the world . It received generally positive reviews from film critics . The film became 2008 's 10th highest grossing film worldwide . 
 = = Plot = = 
 1 @,@ 300 Narnian years after the Pevensie siblings left , Caspian , a Telmarine prince and heir to the throne , is informed by mentor Doctor Cornelius that his uncle , Miraz , is plotting to kill him and seize the throne for himself and his newborn heir . Cornelius gives him Queen Susan 's ancient magical horn , instructing him to blow it only at his greatest need . Caspian flees into the woods where he encounters two Narnian dwarfs , Trumpkin and Nikabrik , and a talking badger named Trufflehunter , and blows the horn to summon help . 
 Only one year in England has passed since the Pevensie children returned from Narnia . The children are waiting for a tube train when the station suddenly starts collapsing and they are magically transported to Narnia . At first they are overjoyed , but soon realize that much time has passed since their last visit , and their castle at Cair <unk> is in ruin with evidence it was attacked by catapults . 
 In the Telmarine castle , the lords of the council learn that Prince Caspian is gone , and Miraz , using Trumpkin , who has been captured , persuades them to attack the Narnians to retrieve Caspian while secretly plotting to kill him instead . Lord Sopespian suspects Miraz 's motives , and discusses his treasonous thoughts with his ally , General Glozelle . 
 The Pevensies save Trumpkin from being drowned by two Telmarines ; he realizes that the four children are the Kings and Queens of Old and they continue on together . Lucy glimpses Aslan and tries convincing the others that she has seen him ; only Edmund believes her . 
 Nikabrik and Trufflehunter lead Caspian to a gathering of the old Narnians , where he convinces them to help him win his throne so he can return their land . They meet the Pevensies and Trumpkin , and all journey to Aslan 's How . Peter decides they will attack Miraz 's castle , rejecting Lucy 's advice that they wait for Aslan to return . 
 The Narnians raid Miraz 's castle , but Caspian ruins the plan by freeing Cornelius instead of opening the gate . He learns that Miraz killed his father , and confronts Miraz but is wounded . Overwhelmed , Peter calls for a retreat . Peter , Susan , Edmund , Caspian and the Narnians escape with heavy losses . Upon returning to Aslan 's How , Peter and Caspian argue , while back at the castle , Miraz is crowned King . 
 Nikabrik , with the aid of a hag and a werewolf , offers Caspian his help to guarantee victory . The hag uses black sorcery to summon Jadis , the White Witch . From inside a wall of ice , the White Witch tries convincing Caspian to free her , when Peter , Edmund , Lucy and Trumpkin arrive . Peter kills the hag , Edmund kills the werewolf , and Trumpkin stabs Nikabrik when he attacks Lucy . Peter knocks Caspian aside to face the Witch himself , but begins to be entranced , until Edmund shatters the ice , destroying the Witch 's apparition . 
 As Miraz and his army arrive at Aslan 's How , Caspian suggests Peter and Miraz duel to the death , with the loser 's army to surrender , to buy Lucy and Susan time to find Aslan . Miraz agrees to the duel , not wanting to look like a coward in front of his men . The girls are attacked by Telmarine soldiers , so Susan remains behind to fight them while Lucy continues alone . Peter defeats Miraz , and gives Caspian his sword to finish him off , but Caspian spares Miraz 's life . Sopespian kills Miraz with one of Susan 's arrows and accuses the Narnians , leading to a battle , with the Telmarines gradually winning . Lucy finds Aslan in the woods and he awakens the trees , turning the battle in the Narnians ' favor . Sopespian orders retreat to a bridge , where they are confronted by Lucy and Aslan . Aslan summons the river god , who destroys the bridge , killing many of the soldiers , swallowing Sopespian and winning the battle . 
 Caspian invites the Telmarines to remain in Narnia if they will coexist peacefully with the Narnians ; but if they wish , they can return to the human world from which they originally came to Narnia . Some , including General Glozelle , agree to do so , and Aslan creates a portal for them and the four Pevensies . Susan kisses Caspian , knowing they will never meet again , as Aslan told her and Peter that they will never return to Narnia . The Pevensies return to England , leaving Caspian as King . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Pevensies 
 William Moseley reprises his role as Peter Pevensie . In a departure from the novel , Peter has a rivalry with Caspian . Moseley explained , 
 " Peter 's got his own issues to deal with , and Caspian 's got his own issues to deal with , and when neither is willing to compromise , there 's bound to be friction . Peter came back to Narnia expecting to be king again and that everyone would do as he said , and Caspian is unwilling to let him take over , so that causes some of it . That 's really what happens . And it 's a lot about humility . I think they both have to learn a certain humility [ ... ] and that 's really what a great king needs is to be humble , to listen to his people , to be willing to compromise , and they start off as these sort of angry teenagers , and become kings at the end . " 
 In real life , the two actors got on well together . Moseley also stated that he identified with Peter , having gone back to school between shooting both films . He trained for three months in New York City to improve his performance and his physicality . 
 Skandar Keynes reprises his role as Edmund Pevensie , the second youngest Pevensie . Edmund matured during the events of The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , so the writers saw him " as our Han Solo " , " [ doing ] the right thing " and " probably going to be a little low @-@ key about it " , highlighting the immaturity of his older brother . Keynes bruised his heel when performing a stunt where he jumped onto a horse . He narrowly missed landing on it and hit his foot against a column when holding on . Excepting that , he enjoyed performing the action . 
 Anna Popplewell reprises her role as Susan Pevensie , the second oldest Pevensie . Popplewell had been disappointed she barely used her bow and arrow in the first film . Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis ' view of women before he met Joy Gresham . " I think [ Lewis ] cast women down in the earlier books , but when you look at The Horse and His Boy , it has a strong female character . Doug 's mother was a strong woman . " Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian , because " The kids are growing up . If you look at Ben and you look at Anna , it seems really implausible that they wouldn 't have some feelings for each other . " He knew it had to be " sensitively handled " though , and ultimately it is not about romance , but " [ accepting ] the fact that you can have a wondrous experience , enjoy it and move on " . Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan , a talented archer , in battle , and that the romance contributed to her character 's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place . 
 Georgie Henley reprises her role as Lucy Pevensie . Henley acknowledged Lucy represents faith in the story , being the youngest and therefore most open @-@ minded of the Pevensies . During filming , Henley 's baby teeth were falling out , so she wore fake teeth to fill in the gaps . 
 Telmarines 
 Ben Barnes as Prince Caspian . Adamson said " Caspian is a coming of age and , to some degree , a loss of innocence story , with Caspian starting out quite naïve , then craving revenge and finally letting go of the vengeance . " While many readers interpret Caspian as a child , a passage in the novel mentions his age to be near that of Peter 's , so an older actor was sought to match Moseley . Barnes had read the novel as a child , and was cast in two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half weeks after meeting with the filmmakers . He spent two months in New Zealand horse riding and stunt training to prepare for shooting . Barnes modelled his Spanish accent on Mandy Patinkin 's performance as Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride , though he also had a dialect coach aiding him . Adamson did not expect to cast a British actor as Caspian , and said Barnes fitted well into the surrogate family of Adamson and the four actors playing the Pevensies . When cast , Barnes was set to tour with the Royal National Theatre 's production of The History Boys : producer Mark Johnson joked Barnes " probably isn 't the Nation 's favourite actor right now " . Barnes left England without telling the Theatre . They were furious when they found out that he had left them without permission , so they considered suing him for breach of contract , but decided against it . 
 Sergio Castellitto as King Miraz . Castellitto was not familiar with the novel , but his four children had enjoyed the first film . Miraz marks the first time the Italian actor has portrayed a villain , and he found it interesting to " act out a stereotype . " Nonetheless , he also felt that he and Adamson brought depth to the role , explaining Miraz is a soldier , not a coward , and that he takes the throne for his son . He compared the character to King Claudius in Hamlet . 
 Pierfrancesco Favino as General Glozelle , Miraz 's military commander , who plots with Sopespian to have his king killed in combat with Caspian and Peter in order to lead his own attack on the Narnians . However , in the end , Glozelle repents and is the first to volunteer to go into the Pevensies ' world , and in return , is granted a good future by Aslan . This was Favino 's idea , because originally Glozelle would have died in battle . Adamson dubbed the character " a real Benedict Arnold " . Favino is able to speak several languages and generally acted as a translator to Adamson on set while working with actors and crew members of multiple nationalities . 
 Damián Alcázar as Lord Sopespian . " In some ways Sopespian turns out to be the real bad guy of the film , " Adamson said . " Where it seems that Miraz has the upper hand at the beginning , we see that Sopespian , like Shakespeare 's Iago , is trying to manipulate the situation . " 
 Vincent Grass as Doctor Cornelius : Caspian 's mentor , who is half @-@ dwarf . Adamson compared Caspian and Cornelius ' relationship to Aristotle and Alexander the Great . Cornelius ' role in the movie is significantly smaller than in the novel , and he is not named on screen , being referred to only as " Professor " . 
 Alicia <unk> as Queen Prunaprismia . Prunaprismia was Miraz 's wife . When she had learned that her husband had killed his own brother , she became heartbroken . After Miraz 's death , Prunaprismia was the second volunteer to go back to our world ( with her child ) . Because of her repenting , <unk> and her child were promised a good life back in our world . 
 Simón Andreu as Lord <unk> . 
 Predrag <unk> as Lord <unk> . 
 David Bowles as Lord <unk> . He served as one of the marshals during the duel between Peter and Miraz . 
 Juan Diego Montoya Garcia as Lord Montoya . 
 Narnians 
 Liam Neeson reprises his role as the voice of the lion Aslan . Aslan is " more parental here , [ he ] lets the kids , well , make their own mistakes " . Aslan 's entrance was filmed as a dream sequence to emphasize his messianic nature , and not make it reflect badly on his absence when Narnia is in turmoil . Although the character is considered C.S. Lewis ' version of Jesus , Neeson " see [ s ] him more as the spirit of the planet – this living , breathing planet . That 's what he stands for , for me ; more what the native Americans would believe . " As Aslan has fewer action scenes than in the first film , the animators found it difficult to make him move interestingly . His pose had to be regal , but if he moved his head too much , he would remind viewers of a dog . As well as having his size increased by fifteen percent , Aslan 's eyes were also changed to look less " Egyptian " . Many of his shots were finished at the last minute . 
 Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin , a cynical red dwarf . Dinklage was Adamson and Johnson 's first choice , having seen him in The Station Agent . He accepted because " often , you get the hero and the villain and not much in between . Trumpkin is in between . He is not a lovable Snow White dwarf . Audiences appreciate these cynical characters . It helps parents and adults to go along with the journey . " Dinklage 's prosthetics took three hours to apply , and restricted his performance to his eyes . Even his frown was built into the make @-@ up . On his first day of filming , he was bitten by sand flies and fell into a river . " We were lucky that he returned after his first day ! " recalled Johnson . 
 Warwick Davis as Nikabrik , a black dwarf . He is descendant of <unk> , who served the White Witch , and bears one of his rings , which was passed down from each generation . Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as the treacherous Nikabrik was casting against type : Berger covered all his face bar his eyelids in prosthetics , to allow Davis to ward off the audience 's perceptions of him . Nikabrik 's nose was based on Berger . Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic , because the grass is filled with ticks , so he put elastic bands to hold his trousers against his legs . Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the 1989 BBC production of Prince Caspian . 
 Ken Stott as the voice of Trufflehunter the badger . Adamson called Trufflehunter " a walking and talking Narnian library [ who is ] totally old @-@ school " . The animators visited a badger sanctuary to aid in depicting his performance . 
 Eddie Izzard as the voice of Reepicheep , a swashbuckling mouse . Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character . Izzard approached Reepicheep as less camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour ( a cross between Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars ) : Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as someone whose family was killed by the Telmarines . The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard read as a child , and he cherished them . When discussing Reepicheep to the animators , Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible . Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own ; beforehand , the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2 . 
 Cornell John as Glenstorm the Centaur . Adamson had seen John perform in Porgy and Bess in London , and liked his long face . John imagined the character as being 170 years old , and wanted to convey " honour , pride and tradition " <unk> <unk> as <unk> ( Glenstorm 's wife ) . 
 Yemi Akinyemi as <unk> ( Glenstorm 's son ) . 
 Carlos Da Silva as <unk> ( Glenstorm 's son ) . 
 David Walliams as the voice of the <unk> Bear . 
 Klara <unk> as a Narnian Hag who attempts to resurrect the White Witch . She used some Arabic words in her incantation . 
 Gomez Mussenden ( son of costume designer Isis Mussenden ) plays Lightning Bolt , a child Centaur . 
 Jan Pavel <unk> as <unk> the giant . 
 Shane Rangi as <unk> the Minotaur and Josh Campbell as the voice of <unk> . An elderly minotaur who aids Caspian . He is killed during the raid while holding the gate open to allow some of the army to escape . Rangi also stood in for Aslan , the <unk> Bear , the Werewolf , another Minotaur , and the Wild Bear on set . Rangi played General <unk> in the previous film and <unk> in The Voyage of The Dawn Treader . He was able to see more in the redesigned animatronic minotaur heads , though " in order to make the eye line straight and correct , you 've actually got to hold your head down , so your view is only about a foot and a half in front of you , which still makes it a little bit hard " . This resulted in Rangi knocking himself against the rising gate of the Telmarine castle , although he was fine and it was the animatronic head that bore the brunt of the damage . The costumes were still very hot , reducing him to a " walking waterfall " . Although a head sculpt of Aslan was used to stand in for the character on the first film , Rangi had to portray the character on set because Lucy interacts with him more . Rangi lost four kilograms wearing all his costumes . 
 Cameos 
 Tilda Swinton reprises her role as Jadis , the White Witch . Her ghost appears as the hag and werewolf attempt to resurrect her . Swinton and her two children also cameoed towards the film 's end as centaurs . 
 Composer Harry Gregson @-@ Williams made a vocal cameo as <unk> the squirrel , as Adamson felt he had a " squirrel @-@ like energy " . 
 Douglas Gresham cameos as a Telmarine crier .

 Before the release of The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , the screenplay for the sequel Prince Caspian had already been written . Director Andrew Adamson said the decision was made to follow the publication order of the novels because " if we don 't make it now we 'll never be able to , because the [ actors will ] be too old " . Prince Caspian , the second published novel in the series , is the fourth chronologically . The Horse and His Boy takes place during a time only hinted at in The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . The writers briefly considered combining Caspian with The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , which the BBC did for their television adaptation . 
 Screenwriters Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely wanted to explore how the Pevensies felt after returning from Narnia , going from being kings and queens back to an awkward year as school children . They noted , " [ C. S. Lewis ] doesn 't much consider what it would be like for a King of Narnia to return to being a 1940 's schoolchild . " They also decided to introduce the Pevensies back into Narnia nearer the start , in order to weave the two separate stories of the Pevensies and Caspian , in contrast to the book 's structure . A sense of guilt on the Pevensies ' part was added , seeing the destruction of Narnia in their absence , as was hubris for Peter to enhance the theme of belief : his arrogance means he is unable to see Aslan . 
 Adamson also desired to make the film larger in scale ; " I 've gained confidence having gone through the first . This time , I was able to go larger [ in ] scale , with more extras and bigger battle scenes . " Inspired by a passage in the novel where Reepicheep says he would like to attack the castle , a new battle scene in which Peter and Caspian make an attempted raid on Miraz 's castle was created . Adamson felt the imagery of mythological Greek creatures storming a castle was highly original . Markus and McFeely used the sequence to illustrate Peter and Caspian 's conflict and Edmund 's maturity , in an effort to tighten the script by using action as drama . Adamson preferred subtlety to the drama scenes , asking his young male actors not to perform angrily . Adamson copied Alfred Hitchcock by " tell [ ing ] people at the end of the scene , ' Now just give me something where you 're not thinking about anything . ' By using it in context , the audience will read an emotion into it . " 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Andrew Adamson described the film as being darker , as it takes place " another 1300 years later , [ and ] Narnia has been oppressed by Telmarines for a large period of that time , so it 's a dirtier , grittier , darker place than the last world was " . He added , " This one is more of a boy 's movie . It 's a harsher world . The villains are human , and that lends a more realistic attitude . " Creatures were designed by veteran horror and monster concept artist Jordu Schell and supervised by Howard Berger , who said that Prince Caspian would be more medieval than The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . Alongside Adamson , Berger 's children critiqued his designs , aiding the process : his son thought the werewolf 's ears were silly , so they were made smaller . 
 For the Narnians , Berger envisioned them as more wild in appearance , as they have been forced into the forests . He also decided to increase the portrayal of various ages , sizes and races . The black dwarfs are distinguished from the red dwarfs as they have more leather and jewellery , and a darker colour scheme in their costumes . Each race of creatures also had their fighting styles made more distinguishable . The minotaurs have maces , and the centaurs use swords . The satyrs were redesigned , as their creation on the first film had been rushed . 4 @,@ 600 make @-@ up jobs were performed , which Berger believes is a record . 
 The filmmakers interpreted the Telmarines , including Caspian , as being Spanish because of their pirate origins , which producer Mark Johnson noted made Caspian " a contrast to the lily @-@ white [ Pevensies ] " . Production designer Roger Ford originally wanted the Telmarines to be French , as they had a confrontational history with the English , who are represented by the Pevensies . This was scrapped as the crew were unable to shoot at Pierrefonds Castle , for Miraz 's lair , so they went for the Spanish feel . Weta Workshop created masked helmets for their army , and faceplates for the live horses on set . The stunt soldiers wield two @-@ hundred polearms in two different styles , two @-@ hundred rapiers of varying design , over a hundred <unk> , two @-@ hundred and fifty shields and fifty @-@ five crossbows . Caspian 's own sword is a variation of the Royal Guard 's weapons . Costume designer Isis Mussenden looked to the paintings of El Greco to inspire the Telmarines ' costumes . She wanted to use colours that looked " acidic and hot and cool at the same time " , unlike the red and gold seen in the Narnian soldiers . Their masked helmets are based on conquistadors and samurai . She visited the armour archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for inspiration . An eagle emblem was incorporated into the characters ' lairs to make them feel fascist . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Eight months were spent scouting locations , including Ireland , China and Argentina , before New Zealand , Prague , Slovenia and Poland were chosen . Whereas the previous film was predominantly shot in New Zealand with a few months of filming in Central Europe , Adamson decided New Zealand lacked enough sound stages to accommodate the larger scale of the film . The decision to film most of the picture in Europe also allowed the ability to shoot during summer in both continents , although the weather turned out to be so erratic during filming that Adamson joked he had been lied to . 
 Filming began on February 12 , 2007 in Auckland . The scene where the Pevensies return to the ruined Cair <unk> was shot at Cathedral Cove . The filmmakers chose the location because it had a tunnel @-@ like arch , which echoed the train tunnel the children go into before being summoned back into Narnia . Henderson Valley Studios was used for the Pevensies ' ancient treasure room and the Underground station . 
 On April 1 , 2007 , the crew began filming at Barrandov Studios in Prague . There , sets such as Miraz 's castle , Aslan 's How and the underground hiding places of the Narnians were created . The 200 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 61 m ) castle was built to scale because Adamson felt he overused digital sets on the last film . The castle was built in the open air during winter , where the temperature would drop to minus 20 ° C. Miraz 's courtyard is the largest set in production designer Roger Ford 's career , including the previous Narnia film . Aslan 's How was modified into the hideout after filming for those scenes was finished . To create Trufflehunter 's den , Ford 's crew put a camera inside a badger 's den to study what it should look like . The den 's roof had to be raised by three inches because Ben Barnes was too tall . 
 In June 2007 , they shot the bridge battle near <unk> in the Soča Valley , Slovenia . The location was chosen for its resemblance to New Zealand . A large bridge was built , which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine . Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days , the filmmakers had around forty . The schedule was short though , but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake . The filmmakers made a trench to change the river 's course , so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked like one could drown in it . The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge ; the trees were moved to another side of the river for decoration . The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled . As part of the clean @-@ up , the cut @-@ down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a recycling plant , while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close @-@ ups shot against bluescreen . 
 Part of the battle was shot at <unk> nad <unk> in the Czech Republic . Only the entrance to Aslan 's How was built on location . Adamson wanted Peter and Miraz 's duel to feel unique and not like a controlled , overly choreographed fencing match : Moseley and Castellitto began training for the scene in November 2006 . The stunt coordinator Allan Poppleton doubled for Castellitto in some shots because they are similar in size . For claustrophobic shots , cameras were built into their shields . The main camera was placed on a 360 degree track surrounding the ruin it takes place on . The filmmakers dug a large hole in the ground for the scene where the Narnians cause the pillars supporting the growth near Aslan 's How to collapse on the Telmarines . The earth was then restored following completion of the scene . They also had to restore the grass after filming numerous cavalry charges . 18 @,@ 000 fern plants were imported to the Czech Republic to create a forest . A scene shot in Poland , which involved building a cliff face , also had to leave no trace behind . Filming finished by September 8 , 2007 . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 Prince Caspian has over 1 @,@ 500 special effects shots , more than The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe 's 800 effects shots , yet the film had less time to complete them . The scale of special effects led Andrew Adamson to base production in the UK , to take advantage of new tax credits . Therefore , it legally qualifies as a British film . This also meant the director only had to walk five minutes from the editing room to supervise the effects . British visual effects companies the Moving Picture Company and Framestore CFC were hired to create the visual effects alongside Weta Digital . Framestore worked on Aslan , Trufflehunter and the door in the air ; Scanline did the River @-@ god ; Weta created the werewolf , the wild bear and Miraz 's castle ; MPC and Escape Studios did the main battle , the tunnel scene , the castle assault , the council scenes and all the other creatures . 
 Alex <unk> , who worked on The Lord of the Rings , directed the film 's miniatures unit . These include 1 / 24th and 1 / 100th scale miniatures of Miraz 's castle . A scale model was built of the Narnians ' cave hideouts during the climactic battle , which the actor playing the giant <unk> was filmed against . One of the improvements made over the previous film was to make the centaurs walk during dialogue scenes , so Cornell John as Glenstorm wore Power <unk> ( mechanical stilts with springs ) , to mimic a horse 's canter and height . The animatronic Minotaur heads were also improved to properly lip sync , although this was not as successful as hoped and had to be revamped digitally . 
 In the climactic battle , 150 extras stood in for the Narnians , while 300 extras were used for the Telmarines . These were digitally duplicated until there were 1 @,@ 000 Narnians and 5 @,@ 000 Telmarines onscreen . The animators found it easier to create entirely digital centaurs and fauns , rather than mix digital legs with real actors . The <unk> were entirely computer @-@ generated , whereas in the first film digital petals had been composited over actors . However , Adamson had chosen to make the centaurs not wear armour , meaning the animators had to make the human – horse join behave more cohesively . Combining digital characters with actors , such as when Lucy hugs Aslan , had become easier since the first film , as lighting had improved . To achieve Lucy hugging Aslan , Framestore even replaced Georgie Henley 's arm with a digital version . For the <unk> , a motion control rig was created for the actors to ride on . The rig could simulate subtle movements such as wing beats for realism . Adamson cited the river @-@ god as the character he was most proud of . " It was a really masterful effect : to control water like that is incredibly difficult " , he said . " The [ visual effects company ] told us they 'd been waiting to do a shot like that for ten years . " 
 The film features catapults resembling windmills , that can fire rapidly , and a ballista that can fire three projectiles at a time . The practical versions of these were metal with fibreglass painted and aged to resemble wood on top . Weta created props of the missiles thrown by the Telmarine equipment . The practical version of the catapult had its upper half painted blue , to composite a digital version programmed for rapid firing movement .
