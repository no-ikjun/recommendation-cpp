 Jesse L. Martin was the first actor considered to play the part of Exley . Duchovny had first noticed Martin in a production of the musical Rent , and noticed him again during a guest appearance on the Fox legal comedy @-@ drama Ally McBeal . Watching the latter performance , Duchovny decided that Martin had the " right feel " for the lead role . Duchovny later noted that he had little involvement with the casting process since a majority of the characters in the episode were recurring . 
 Originally , Darren McGavin was set to reprise his role as Arthur Dales ; the character had previously appeared in the episodes " Travelers " and " Agua Mala " . Two days after filming began , McGavin suffered a stroke , forcing Duchovny and the producers to remove from the episode the few scenes he had shot , rewrite the script to explain his absence , and replace his character with M. Emmet Walsh . Because many of the scenes featuring a younger Dales had already been shot , Duchovny was forced to give Walsh 's character the same name as McGavin 's character ; this was justified in the episode as a quirk on behalf of the two brothers ' parents . The two scenes that were filmed with McGavin included the sequence in which Mulder asks Dales whether all great baseball players are aliens , and a scene in which Mulder asks Dales why he joined the FBI . McGavin , who eventually recovered , later allowed the scenes to be included on the sixth season DVD as bonus features . Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later called it a " great sorrow that " the show had to replace Darren McGavin because the series ' producers were " huge fans " of his role in the 1972 film The Night Stalker and television series of the same name . 
 Actor Frederic Lane had previously appeared in " Travelers , " playing the younger version of McGavin 's character . Since McGavin was written out of the episode , Lane played the younger version of Walsh 's character . Los Angeles Dodgers radio announcer Vin Scully , whose name was the original inspiration for Dana Scully 's name , played the baseball announcer in this episode . The announcer was initially unable to appear owing to budgetary issues , but later agreed to record his part for free . Daniel Duchovny , David 's brother , appeared in this episode in a minor role as a bench jockey .

 " The Unnatural " was the first entry of the series to be directed by Duchovny . While Duchovny was working on plot points with Carter , the two agreed that the episode would serve as Duchovny 's directorial debut . As the episode did not heavily feature his character , since it is framed as a flashback , Duchovny was able to focus on pre @-@ production . This <unk> method also gave Anderson a minor respite from her work . While Duchovny later expressed gratitude that " The Unnatural " enabled him to get a feel for directing , he also experienced severe anxiety during the production process because of the stress of both writing and directing . However , when the episode was finished , Duchovny was pleased , calling the results " great . " He later noted that his stress was largely uncalled for because the episode would have been made even " if [ he ] just showed up and <unk> for 24 hours a day . " 
 The first five seasons of the series were mainly filmed in Vancouver , British Columbia , but production of the show 's sixth season was based in Los Angeles , California . Jay Littleton Ballfield , an all @-@ wood stadium located in Ontario , California , was used as the setting for the Roswell Baseball Stadium . The show 's producers advertised in local newspapers and on local radio for fans to attend the game dressed in 1940s clothing . During filming , a raffle was held between takes , and signed copies of the The X @-@ Files movie , soundtrack , and film poster were given away . The scene featuring Mulder teaching Scully how to play baseball was filmed at Cheviot Hills Park in Los Angeles . The park was later used in the eighth season episode " Three Words " and the ninth season episode " Lord of the Flies " . 
 Costume designer Christine Peters crafted the episode 's baseball uniforms after visiting Sports Robe , a Hollywood costume house . Dena Green from the hair department gave extras haircuts so that they would be in the style of the 1940s . Car coordinator Kelly <unk> rented two 1947 model Flexible buses for the Roswell Greys on @-@ bus scenes , as well as various other <unk> and 1940s @-@ era cars . Researcher Lee Smith worked with the Baseball Hall of Fame to ensure the accuracy of the statistics used in the episode . The props department developed from scratch the Peter Rosebud Bank that Dales shows Mulder ; it was one of the most expensive props of the season . The score by Mark Snow , the show 's composer , was recorded with musicians rather than synthesizers for the first time in the series ' history ; slide guitar player Nick <unk> and harmonica performer Tommy Morgan assisted Snow with the music .

 Near the beginning of the episode , Mulder uses one of William Blake 's " Proverbs of Hell " from his 18th century book The Marriage of Heaven and Hell in an argument with Scully : " The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom . " Sharon R. Yang , in her essay " Weaving and Unweaving the Story , " writes that Mulder is using affluent literature to " justify his passionate dedication to questing for knowledge in arcane areas scorned by mainstream intellectual authority " . In addition , Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , argue that the episode functions as a fairy tale , and that its conclusion is an example of a happy ending ; Exley bleeds red blood as he lays dying , granting the alien his wish to become human . In addition , the two mused that the meta nature of the episode is similar to the way fans of the series reacted to new episodes of The X @-@ Files . 
 Ideas of racism and segregation also permeate the episode . Sara Gwenllian @-@ Jones in her book Cult Television argues that , throughout the entry , " the blacks are equated with aliens , " turning them into a certain type of " other " that is " never allowed to fit in or feel safe " . Gwenllian @-@ Jones highlights the scene in which Dales , late one night on the team bus , wakes to see Exley 's sleeping body being reflected as an alien in a window as an example of the racial comparison . She points out that , despite coming to Earth , Exley has moved from one segregated society — that of the aliens — into another . She points out that Exley , after revealing his true form to Dales , says that " my people guard their privacy zealously . They don 't want our people to intermingle with your people " . This quote expresses a similar sentiment to the segregated mentality of the 1940s .

 The cast and crew of the show were complimentary towards the finished episode . Carter said , " I think that David , a person who has a very intimate understanding of the show , made the best of his opportunity to tell a very different kind of X @-@ File , and expand the elastic show that it is . " Anderson was also pleased , saying , " I was proud of David for writing the script . I thought it was wonderful . He was kind and gentle and respectful and humble , and always tried to do his best . " 
 Initial reviews were positive . Eric Mink from the New York Daily News , in a pre @-@ premiere review , said that it " ingeniously grafts classic X @-@ Files story elements and wry , self @-@ mocking wit onto a delightfully fresh premise " . The Lexington Herald @-@ Leader 's review mostly positive , complimenting the clever writing and noting that the " show was full of visual delights " . Sarah Stegall awarded the episode five points out of five , praising Duchovny 's analysis of " bigotry from two angles " and his ability to tie the " ongoing X @-@ Files conspiracy arc ... into a comic tragedy like this " . Stegall also called Duchovny 's direction " innovative and interesting " , and applauded a transition scene , in which the camera apparently moves through a television screen , as " a wonderful visual metaphor for The X @-@ Files itself " . 
 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review , awarding it four stars out of four . Vitaris was complimentary towards the episode 's exposition , and wrote , " above all , ' The Unnatural ' is about the power of storytelling . We don 't really know if Dales ' story is true or if it 's the liquor @-@ fueled ramblings of a broken @-@ down man , but in the end , this is irrelevant . " Melissa Runstrom from Michigan Daily called it a " charming independent story , " but that it " seems to say more about the human condition than about any extraterrestrial plot " . Tom Kessenich , in his book Examinations : An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6 – 9 of the X @-@ Files wrote , " In his entertaining debut as an X @-@ Files writer / director , Duchovny took us down a very familiar path this season : [ humor ] . But unlike some previous navigators , Duchovny stayed on course , made sure we saw all of the spectacular landmarks along the way and , when we reached our final destination , I found I thoroughly enjoyed the ride . " 
 Recent reviews have also applauded the episode . Shearman and Pearson rated the episode five stars out of five , describing it as " [ a ] delightful ... comic fable " . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an " A – " and wrote that it " works because it takes this very silly idea and proceeds to take it seriously . " He criticized the program for its " corniness " and its reliance on the " magical black guy " stereotype , but concluded that " The Unnatural " was successful " because it embraces this side of the show ’ s profile [ that ] could do something sweet and lovely and moving " . VanDerWerff also complimented Martin 's performance , calling his acting " terrific " . Cynthia Fuchs from PopMatters wrote that Duchovny 's directing debut was excellent . 
 Since its debut , the episode has been ranked as one of the best episodes of The X @-@ Files . Kessenich named it one of the " Top 25 Episode of All Time " of The X @-@ Files , ranking it at number six . The Vancouver Sun listed " The Unnatural " on their list of the best standalone episodes of the show , and said that the story was heartbreaking . In addition , the scene featuring Mulder teaching Scully to play baseball was well received by critics . Shearman and Pearson wrote that it " is especially delightful , and gives this sentimental episode an extra warm glow . " Jean Helms of The Mobile Register named it one of the " Top 10 X @-@ Files Clips We 'd Like to See in the Official Video of Bree Sharp 's ' David Duchovny ' " . Vitaris called the scene " one of the most charming finales in an X @-@ Files episode " due to its " utterly endearing " qualities and its " unspoken subtext " . 
 = Wet Hot Demonic Summer = 
 " Wet Hot Demonic Summer " is the second season premiere of the American animated television series Ugly Americans , and the fifteenth overall episode of the series . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on June 30 , 2011 . In the episode , Leonard Powers is about to retire as the Wizard of Social Services and give the job to his apprentice , Lionel , whom he abandoned fifty years prior . Meanwhile , Twayne Boneraper and Callie Maggotbone must infiltrate the compound where the wizards hold the initiation ritual , but their complicated strategy involves building a summer camp with Mark Lilly as the head counselor . 
 The episode was written by Daniel Powell and directed by Aaron Augenblick . Powell was inspired to write the episode after reading a critic 's review of the series ; the critic referred to Leonard as having " omnipotence " , which spurred an idea involving the character having to take responsibility . " Wet Hot Demonic Summer " parodies the Harry Potter series , particularly the character design of Lionel . The Harry Potter elements were planned nine months in advance to coincide with the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 , which premiered two weeks after the episode aired . 
 " Wet Hot Demonic Summer " received generally positive reviews from television critics ; several commentators praised its cultural references and claimed that it showed similar quality to that of the series ' first season . According to Nielsen Media Research , " Wet Hot Demonic Summer " was watched by 1 @.@ 14 million viewers in its original airing and attracted less viewers than the series ' pilot episode . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Leonard Powers , the Wizard of Social Services , is about to retire and takes his apprentice to Mount Magic to complete the initiation ceremony . For a wizard to retire , they must hatch their apprentice from an egg and train them for fifty years . However , Leonard abandoned his apprentice , the Harry Potter @-@ like Lionel , in Chinatown and did not contact him until the ceremony . Later , it is revealed that to become a wizard , the apprentices must be circumcised . Meanwhile , the demons — the wizard 's enemies — are ready to attack Mount Magic , but a force field is keeping them out . Since Leonard still needs to sign his retirement forms , demons Twayne Boneraper and Callie Maggotbone decide to use Mark Lilly to lead them to Leonard . To get Mark to come along , they elect him as the camp leader for a summer camp ( originally a mining camp ) that they build nearby . Mark brings his students from the Department of Integration to the camp , and the devil , Aldermach , brings several demons to act like the camp 's visitors . The department 's police officer , Frank Grimes , also comes along , but runs away to live with bears as he thinks the camp is infested by vermin . Mark 's students and his roommate , the zombie Randall , begin to mine in an old silver mine . However , they get trapped inside , but Doug the koala begins to dig them out . 
 At Mount Magic , Lionel is upset because Leonard abandoned him , and goes outside to the balcony , where he spots Callie swimming in the lake while wearing a bikini , and he declares that " she will be mine " . Mark arrives at the lake and sees Leonard from the balcony and tells him that he forgot to sign his retirement forms . Leonard explains how to come to the secret entrance to Mark , which the demons hear . Later , Mark meets Leonard and Lionel at the entrance , where he signs his forms and is ready to retire . Moments later , when initiation ceremony begins at Mount Magic , the demons invade the compound and a battle between wizards and demons commences , while Lionel runs away to be with Callie , who , being the camp 's " sexy counselor " , has sex with him before Mark interrupts . Grimes arrives with his army of bears and soon thereafter , Doug arrives in a hole that he dug ; the hole collapses the floor and all the demons and bears are consumed by it . As the battle ends , the sun goes down and it is too late for Lionel to be circumcised and take over as the Wizard of Social Services , so Leonard continues to work and begins to raise a new egg .

 " Wet Hot Demonic Summer " was written by Daniel Powell and directed by Aaron Augenblick . Series creator Devin Clark said that they planned on giving it a summer theme since they knew it would air in the summer . Clark further elaborated on the decision to incorporate summer and Harry Potter themes into the episode , stating : " We went , ' alright , those are two little nuggets of ideas we can incorporate into that . ' We can 't be as relevant to pop culture as some other shows , but it just means we have a little more of a challenge of making jokes that are a little more evergreen and poking fun of the genre in a much broader spectrum . " Screenwriter Powell explained that it is difficult for the series to do " topical stuff " as it takes up to nine months to complete an episode , but they were aware of the fact that the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 would premiere shortly after the episode was set to air . " So it would seem like we were hyper @-@ topical , even though we had a good nine months advance notice " , he said . Powell said that they included famous wizards from many other sources , including The Lord of the Rings and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . In an interview with Charles Webb of MTV , Clark elaborated : " We make it a hodgepodge of the wizard references and obviously the main one is , and the most prominent one and the one that 's most relevant to pop culture is the Harry Potter spoof that we 've thrown in there . 
 The episode explores Leonard 's background and that he is " essentially a deadbeat dad " . In an interview with Matt Barone of the magazine Complex , Powell revealed that he was inspired to write the episode after reading a critic 's review which referred to Leonard as " basically [ having ] omnipotence " as he is able to conjure any magic he wants , but is too lazy to take advantage of his powers . The review spurred an idea for an episode where Leonard would be responsible for dealing with a kid . Powell called the episode 's mythology " very bizarre and surreal " , but said that they tried to keep the core themes relatable , such as Leonard 's relationship with his estranged son . The same day as the episode 's original broadcast , a deleted scene from " Wet Hot Demonic Summer " was made available on the official Ugly Americans website . In the half @-@ minute clip , Grimes is shown settling into living his life as a bear .

 " Wet Hot Demonic Summer " received generally positive reviews from critics . David Hinckley of New York Daily News rated it four out of five stars and commented that although it may not make sense to some viewers , it is " equally possible they will keep watching anyway because the jokes work so well all by themselves " . Hinckley went on to remark that " Ugly Americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes . Happily , its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even if some of the references are whizzing by unappreciated " . RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that that it includes " visual pizzazz " , cultural references and " so @-@ fast @-@ you 'll @-@ miss @-@ them jokes " that it might require multiple viewings .

" Lastly , Wagner observed that " Ugly Americans can be gross and bizarre , but everything makes sense in the world that it has created " . 
 Josh Harrison of Ology deemed the episode a " good sign " that the second season will be " just as good , if not better " than the first season . He said , " The way it all works together in this episode ... is subtle and surprising but nevertheless convincing evidence that there 's method to the madness . Ugly Americans knows when to play this card ; at all other junctures , it 's got the right instinct when it shows us yet more madness . " Harrison praised the battle scene between the wizards and the demons , calling it " one of the best single sequences in the series so far " . In contrast , The Standard @-@ Times critic Kevin McDonough was more critical regarding the episode , noting that it " tries a tad too hard " . McDonough commented : " The efforts to meld 1980s summer @-@ camp fantasy comedies with the Harry Potter movies are more odd than amusing .

 Dr. Otto Octavius is preparing to attach an exoskeleton onto Alex O 'Hirn 's body , modeled after that of a rhinoceros . Though Octavius is wary about going through with the experiment , Hammerhead forces him to activate it . O 'Hirn 's body is surgically attached to the suit and is given immeasurable strength . Meanwhile , Peter Parker is at the Daily Bugle trying to ask out Betty Brant to his school 's fall formal , despite their four @-@ year age difference ; she finally agrees to consider it and Peter hurries homeward , exhilarated , until he realizes he will need money for the date . He tells his best friend Harry about his plans at school the next day . Peter then receives a text message that his Aunt May is having lunch with Betty at the Bugle . Flash Thompson then gives Peter a <unk> just before Peter runs off . 
 O 'Hirn dubs himself the " Rhino " and storms through the Bugle main office , where Aunt May and Betty are having lunch , and demands that J. Jonah Jameson tells him where Peter is , as he knows Peter photographs Spider @-@ Man . Jameson spots Peter hiding after just arriving and lies to Rhino about not knowing where he is . Peter sneaks off and dons his Spider @-@ Man costume , then engages Rhino in a fight . He wonders what the " Big Man " has been up to with all the supervillains , like Rhino , he has been organizing . Spider @-@ Man has a large scale brawl through the city and soon realizes that Rhino needs to be constantly hydrated in order to fight . He lures him into a steam tunnel and breaks all the pipes , dehydrating Rhino into unconsciousness . As he passes out , Rhino accidentally mentions that " Big Man " is really a man named Mr. Lincoln . 
 Peter goes back to the Bugle and claims to have been hiding the whole time . Betty pulls him aside and tells him that she is simply too old to date him and is sorry ; Peter , still downtrodden , remembers what the Rhino said and asks a reporter if he knows about anyone by that name . The reporter tells him about L. Thompson Lincoln , a philanthropist who is rumored to be a dangerous crime lord . That night Peter goes to Lincoln 's office as Spider @-@ Man to find out if the rumors are true . Lincoln prefers to be called " Tombstone " and wields incredible strength ; he pins him down and suggests that he work for him , fighting crime like usual but turning his head when it comes to his crimes . Spider @-@ Man refuses to do so and runs off . 
 When Peter gets home , he is depressed . Aunt May insists that he gets dressed for the formal and explains that she has arranged for him to go with Mary Jane Watson . Peter thinks that she will turn out to be a plain girl due to the descriptions Aunt May has given him , but when she arrives he learns that she is an attractive girl and is flabbergasted .

 " The Invisible Hand " was written by Matt Wayne . Wayne had previously written the episode " Natural Selection " and went on to write " Persona " . Dave Bullock , who directed the animated feature film Justice League : The New Frontier , directed the episode . The title of the episode follows the " Education of Peter Parker " scheme Greg Weisman , a developer and producer for The Spectacular Spider @-@ Man , created . The naming scheme for the second story arc of season one refers to economics . 
 There was a scene cut from the episode after it was written , recorded , and storyboarded . The scene featured Rhino looking in a phone book for individuals named " Peter Parker " in the tri @-@ state area . He storms into a " Peter James Parker " ( Kevin Michael Richardson ) , a blind , elderly African @-@ American bassoon player , accusing him of being the Peter Parker he is looking for . The man is outraged and asks him , " Do I look like I 'm a photographer ? " Rhino himself is furious as there are several Peter Parkers in the tri @-@ state area . Weisman was upset that it was removed and called it " just hilarious " . 
 Weisman and casting director Jamie Thomason each easily picked out Clancy Brown for the role of Rhino . Weisman explains , " We knew Rhino would require a voice with strength and menace , but Rhino also isn 't the brightest bulb on the marquee , so we knew whoever we cast would also have to have the acting chops and comic timing to take the character beyond the usual dumb goon . " They each had worked with Brown previously and knew he would be able to " nail it " , as he is able to give a " tough , low voice " and " turn on a dime between dangerous and comedic characterizations . " 
 Brown sought to reflect the Rhino 's simplistic thinking style in his voice . He believes " the quintessential ' thug ' was played by William Bendix in The Glass Key . The simpler the character , the simpler the thought process . That means Rhino 's ' motivation ' is never too complicated [ ... ] he 's very elemental . He 's mad or happy or angry or sad or hungry or whatever . And it never gets beyond his appetites or ego . " Brown considers that Bendix 's performance perfectly portrayed this type of character .

Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 @.@ 0 / 10 , ( " Impressive " ) writing , " For an episode that began ho @-@ hum , things certainly got interesting in the last half , with two surprise introductions . " Goldman praised the fight sequences as well as the unveiling of Tombstone and Mary Jane . Goldman concluded his review by writing , " It 's a testament to this show that it has it exactly right that Peter Parker 's everyday , unmasked persona is so integral to the story , and that I actually am very curious how this dance goes . " 
 Sean Elliot of iF Magazine gave the episode a " B + " and wrote that it was a " well @-@ thought out premise " . Elliot was " pleased " with the portrayal of Rhino as an unintelligent brute ; he also enjoyed the change of the " Big Man 's " identity from that of the comics - where he was a Bugle reporter named Frederic <unk> - and found it humorous to have <unk> be the reporter to tell Peter who the " Big Man " is rumored to be .

 = Hafnium = 
 Hafnium is a chemical element with symbol Hf and atomic number 72 . A lustrous , silvery gray , tetravalent transition metal , hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in zirconium minerals . Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 , though it was not identified until 1923 , making it the penultimate stable element to be discovered ( rhenium was identified two years later ) . Hafnium is named after Hafnia , the Latin name for Copenhagen , where it was discovered . 
 Hafnium is used in filaments and electrodes . Some semiconductor fabrication processes use its oxide for integrated circuits at 45 nm and smaller feature lengths . Some superalloys used for special applications contain hafnium in combination with niobium , titanium , or tungsten . 
 Hafnium 's large neutron capture cross @-@ section makes it a good material for neutron absorption in control rods in nuclear power plants , but at the same time requires that it be removed from the neutron @-@ transparent corrosion @-@ resistant zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Physical characteristics = = = 
 Hafnium is a shiny , silvery , ductile metal that is corrosion @-@ resistant and chemically similar to zirconium ( due to not only to its having the same number of valence electrons and being in the same group , but also to relativistic effects ) . The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities , especially the nuclear properties , as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity . 
 A notable physical difference between these metals is their density , with zirconium having about one @-@ half the density of hafnium . The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron @-@ capture cross @-@ section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece . In contrast with this , zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons , and it is commonly used for the metal components of nuclear reactors – especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods . 
 = = = Chemical characteristics = = = 
 Hafnium reacts in air to form a protective film that inhibits further corrosion . The metal is not readily attacked by acids but can be oxidized with halogens or it can be burnt in air . Like its sister metal zirconium , finely divided hafnium can ignite spontaneously in air , producing an effect similar to that obtained in Dragon 's Breath . The metal is resistant to concentrated alkalis . 
 The chemistry of hafnium and zirconium is so similar that the two cannot be separated on the basis of differing chemical reactions . The melting points and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the major differences in the chemistry of these twin elements . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 At least 34 isotopes of hafnium have been observed , ranging in mass number from 153 to 186 . The five stable isotopes are in the range of 176 to 180 . The radioactive isotopes ' half @-@ lives range from only 400 ms for <unk> , to 2 @.@ 0 <unk> ( 1015 years ) for the most stable one , <unk> . 
 The nuclear isomer 178m2Hf was at the center of a controversy for several years regarding its potential use as a weapon . 
 = = = Occurrence = = = 
 Hafnium is estimated to make up about 5 @.@ 8 ppm of the Earth 's upper crust by mass . It does not exist as a free element in nature , but is found combined in solid solution with zirconium in natural zirconium compounds such as zircon , ZrSiO4 , which usually has about 1 – 4 % of the Zr replaced by Hf . Rarely , the Hf / Zr ratio increases during crystallization to give the isostructural mineral " <unk> " ( Hf , Zr ) SiO4 , with atomic Hf > Zr . An old ( obsolete ) name for a variety of zircon containing unusually high Hf content is <unk> . 
 A major source of zircon ( and hence hafnium ) ores is heavy mineral sands ore deposits , pegmatites , particularly in Brazil and Malawi , and carbonatite intrusions , particularly the Crown <unk> Deposit at Mount Weld , Western Australia . A potential source of hafnium is trachyte tuffs containing rare zircon @-@ hafnium silicates <unk> or <unk> , at Dubbo in New South Wales , Australia . 
 Hafnium reserves have been infamously estimated to last under 10 years by one source if the world population increases and demand grows . In reality , since hafnium occurs with zirconium , hafnium can always be a byproduct of zirconium extraction to the extent that the low demand requires . 
 = = Production = = 
 The heavy mineral sands ore deposits of the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile yield most of the mined zirconium , and therefore also most of the hafnium . 
 Zirconium is a good nuclear fuel @-@ rod cladding metal , with the desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross @-@ section and good chemical stability at high temperatures . However , because of hafnium 's neutron @-@ absorbing properties , hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear @-@ reactor applications . Thus , a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power . The production of hafnium @-@ free zirconium is the main source for hafnium . 
 The chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are nearly identical , which makes the two difficult to separate . The methods first used — fractional crystallization of ammonium fluoride salts or the fractionated distillation of the chloride — have not proven suitable for an industrial @-@ scale production . After zirconium was chosen as material for nuclear reactor programs in the 1940s , a separation method had to be developed . Liquid @-@ liquid extraction processes with a wide variety of solvents were developed and are still used for the production of hafnium . About half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced as a by @-@ product of zirconium refinement . The end product of the separation is hafnium ( IV ) chloride . The purified hafnium ( IV ) chloride is converted to the metal by reduction with magnesium or sodium , as in the Kroll process . 
 <unk> + 2 Mg ( 1100 ° C ) → 2 MgCl2 + Hf 
 Further purification is effected by a chemical transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer : In a closed vessel , hafnium reacts with iodine at temperatures of 500 ° C , forming hafnium ( IV ) iodide ; at a tungsten filament of 1700 ° C the reverse reaction happens , and the iodine and hafnium are set free . The hafnium forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament , and the iodine can react with additional hafnium , resulting in a steady turn over . 
 Hf + 2 I2 ( 500 ° C ) → <unk> 
 <unk> ( 1700 ° C ) → Hf + 2 I2

 Hafnium and zirconium form nearly identical series of chemical compounds . Hafnium tends to form inorganic compounds in the oxidation state of + 4 . <unk> react with it to form hafnium tetrahalides . At higher temperatures , hafnium reacts with oxygen , nitrogen , carbon , boron , sulfur , and silicon . Due to the lanthanide contraction of the elements in the sixth period , zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical ionic radii . The ionic radius of Zr4 + is 0 @.@ 79 angstrom and that of <unk> + is 0 @.@ 78 angstrom . 
 Hafnium ( IV ) chloride and hafnium ( IV ) iodide have some applications in the production and purification of hafnium metal . They are volatile solids with polymeric structures . These <unk> are precursors to various <unk> compounds such as <unk> dichloride and <unk> . 
 The white hafnium oxide ( HfO2 ) , with a melting point of <unk> ° C and a boiling point of roughly 5100 ° C , is very similar to zirconia , but slightly more basic . Hafnium carbide is the most refractory binary compound known , with a melting point over <unk> ° C , and hafnium nitride is the most refractory of all known metal nitrides , with a melting point of <unk> ° C. This has led to proposals that hafnium or its carbides might be useful as construction materials that are subjected to very high temperatures . The mixed carbide tantalum hafnium carbide ( Ta 
 <unk> 
 5 ) possesses the highest melting point of any currently known compound , <unk> ° C. Recent supercomputer simulations suggest a hafnium alloy with a melting point of 4400 K. 
 = = History = = 
 In his report on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements , in 1869 , Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly predicted the existence of a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium . At the time of his formulation in 1871 , Mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum ( element 57 ) in the spot below zirconium . The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties . 
 The X @-@ ray spectroscopy done by Henry Moseley in 1914 showed a direct dependency between spectral line and effective nuclear charge . This led to the nuclear charge , or atomic number of an element , being used to ascertain its place within the periodic table . With this method , Moseley determined the number of lanthanides and showed the gaps in the atomic number sequence at numbers 43 , 61 , 72 , and 75 . 
 The discovery of the gaps led to an extensive search for the missing elements . In 1914 , several people claimed the discovery after Henry Moseley predicted the gap in the periodic table for the then @-@ undiscovered element 72 . Georges Urbain asserted that he found element 72 in the rare earth elements in 1907 and published his results on celtium in 1911 . Neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior matched with the element found later , and therefore his claim was turned down after a long @-@ standing controversy . The controversy was partly because the chemists favored the chemical techniques which led to the discovery of celtium , while the physicists relied on the use of the new X @-@ ray spectroscopy method that proved that the substances discovered by Urbain did not contain element 72 . By early 1923 , several physicists and chemists such as Niels Bohr and Charles R. Bury suggested that element 72 should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the rare earth elements group . These suggestions were based on Bohr 's theories of the atom , the X @-@ ray spectroscopy of Mosley , and the chemical arguments of Friedrich Paneth . 
 Encouraged by these suggestions and by the reappearance in 1922 of Urbain 's claims that element 72 was a rare earth element discovered in 1911 , Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy were motivated to search for the new element in zirconium ores . Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen , Denmark , validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev . It was ultimately found in zircon in Norway through X @-@ ray spectroscopy analysis . The place where the discovery took place led to the element being named for the Latin name for " Copenhagen " , Hafnia , the home town of Niels Bohr . Today , the Faculty of Science of the University of Copenhagen uses in its seal a stylized image of the hafnium atom . 
 Hafnium was separated from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von <unk> . Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer were the first to prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in 1924 . This process for differential purification of zirconium and hafnium is still in use today . 
 In 1923 , four predicted elements were still missing from the periodic table : 43 ( technetium ) and 61 ( promethium ) are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment , thus making elements 75 ( rhenium ) and 72 ( hafnium ) the last two unknown non @-@ radioactive elements . Since rhenium was discovered in 1925 , hafnium was the next @-@ to @-@ last element with stable isotopes to be discovered . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Several details contribute to the fact that there are only a few technical uses for hafnium : First , the close similarity between hafnium and zirconium makes it possible to use zirconium for most of the applications ; second , hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for hafnium @-@ free zirconium in the late 1950s . Furthermore , the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity . 
 Most of the hafnium produced is used in the production of control rods for nuclear reactors . 
 = = = Nuclear reactors = = = 
 The nuclei of several hafnium isotopes can each absorb multiple neutrons . This makes hafnium a good material for use in the control rods for nuclear reactors . Its neutron @-@ capture cross @-@ section is about 600 times that of zirconium . ( Other elements that are good neutron @-@ absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron . ) Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion @-@ resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of pressurized water reactors . The German research reactor <unk> II uses hafnium as a neutron absorber . It is also common in military reactors , particularity in US naval reactors , but seldom found in civilian ones , the first core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station ( a conversion of a naval reactor ) being a notable exception . 
 = = = Alloys = = = 
 Hafnium is used in alloys with iron , titanium , niobium , tantalum , and other metals . An alloy used for liquid rocket thruster nozzles , for example the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules , is <unk> which consists of 89 % niobium , 10 % hafnium and 1 % titanium . 
 Small additions of hafnium increase the adherence of protective oxide scales on nickel @-@ based alloys . It improves thereby the corrosion resistance especially under cyclic temperature conditions that tend to break oxide scales by inducing thermal stresses between the bulk material and the oxide layer . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Hafnium @-@ based compounds are employed in gate insulators in the 45 nm generation of integrated circuits from Intel , IBM and others . Hafnium oxide @-@ based compounds are practical high @-@ k <unk> , allowing reduction of the gate leakage current which improves performance at such scales . 
 = = = Isotope geochemistry = = = 
 Isotopes of hafnium and lutetium ( along with ytterbium ) are also utilized in isotope geochemistry and <unk> applications . It is often used as a tracer of isotopic evolution of Earth ’ s mantle through time . This is because <unk> decays to <unk> with a half @-@ life of approximately 37 billion years . 
 In most geologic materials , zircon is the dominant host of hafnium ( > 10 @,@ 000 ppm ) and is often the focus of hafnium studies in geology . Hafnium is readily substituted into the zircon crystal lattice , and is therefore very resistant to hafnium mobility and contamination . Zircon also has an extremely low Lu / Hf ratio , making any correction for initial lutetium minimal . Although the Lu / Hf system can be used to calculate a " model age " , i.e. the time at which it was derived from a given isotopic reservoir such as the depleted mantle , these " ages " do not carry the same geologic significance as do other <unk> techniques as the results often yield isotopic mixtures and thus provide an average age of the material from which it was derived . 
 Garnet is another mineral that contains appreciable amounts of hafnium to act as a <unk> . Given the high and variable Lu / Hf ratios found in garnet make it useful for dating metamorphic events . 
 = = = Other uses = = = 
 Due to its heat resistance and its affinity to oxygen and nitrogen , hafnium is a good scavenger for oxygen and nitrogen in gas @-@ filled and incandescent lamps . Hafnium is also used as the electrode in plasma cutting because of its ability to shed electrons into air . 
 The high energy content of 178m2Hf was the concern of a DARPA @-@ funded program in the US . This program determined that the possibility of using a nuclear isomer of hafnium ( the above @-@ mentioned 178m2Hf ) to construct high @-@ yield weapons with X @-@ ray triggering mechanisms — an application of induced gamma emission — was infeasible because of its expense . See Hafnium controversy . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Care needs to be taken when machining hafnium because it is pyrophoric — fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air . Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people . The pure metal is not considered toxic , but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity , and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds . 
 People can be exposed to hafnium in the workplace by breathing it in , swallowing it , skin contact , and eye contact . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) has set the legal limit ( Permissible exposure limit ) for exposure to hafnium and hafnium compounds in the workplace as TWA 0 @.@ 5 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) has set the same recommended exposure limit ( REL ) . At levels of 50 mg / m3 , hafnium is immediately dangerous to life and health . 
 = Tropical Storm Beryl ( 2006 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Beryl was the third tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season . Developing from a tropical disturbance on July 18 , it tracked generally northward , and strengthened to attain peak winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) under generally favorable conditions . After turning to the northeast , Beryl weakened over cooler waters . On July 21 it struck the island of Nantucket , and shortly thereafter it became extratropical . The extratropical remnants continued northeastward through Nova Scotia , and on July 22 it merged with an approaching cold front . 
 Beryl produced rough seas along the northeast United States coastline . In Massachusetts , its impact was limited to light rainfall and gusty winds , with no reported damage . Beryl later produced moderate rainfall and gusty winds across Atlantic Canada , resulting in some localized power outages though little damage . No deaths were reported . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled off the coast of North Carolina . It gradually decayed into a surface low pressure trough , and developed into two disturbances ; one was centered 290 miles ( 490 km ) south @-@ southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200 miles ( 320 km ) south of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm , and the other area initially remained broad and ill @-@ defined . However , by July 18 , the system became much better organized with improved banding features , and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220 miles ( 355 km ) south @-@ southeast of Cape Hatteras . 
 The depression moved slowly to the north @-@ northwest through a break in the subtropical ridge , and as convective banding features became more prominent the system intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl . Throughout much of its duration , the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well @-@ established upper @-@ level outflow . Shortly after becoming a tropical storm , the low @-@ level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection , though deep convection re @-@ developed the following morning . Outflow continued to improve , and with warm sea surface temperatures Beryl gradually intensified to attain peak winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) early on July 20 while located about 120 miles ( 190 km ) east of Nags Head , North Carolina . 
 Beryl maintained peak winds for about 18 hours as it paralleled the Mid @-@ Atlantic and New Jersey coasts , during which an eye @-@ like feature developed in the center of the convection . Late on July 20 , it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters . Steering winds ahead of an approaching mid @-@ level trough caused Beryl to accelerate northeastward , and early on July 21 the center of the storm crossed the island of Nantucket . The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters , and shortly after 1200 UTC on July 21 Beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod . Hours later , it made landfall in southwestern Nova Scotia , and on July 22 the extratropical remnants of Beryl merged with an approaching cold front over Newfoundland . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Forecasters initially predicted Beryl to brush the Carolinas ; as such , a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern coast of North Carolina from Cape Lookout northward to Currituck Beach Lighthouse . When a more northeastward track became apparent , a tropical storm watch was issued about 33 hours prior to moving ashore from Woods Hole to Plymouth , Massachusetts , including Cape Cod , Nantucket , and Martha 's Vineyard . About 22 hours before landfall , the National Hurricane Center replaced the watch with a tropical storm warning for the same area , and also issued a tropical storm watch from Woods Hole , Massachusetts westward to New Haven , Connecticut and for the eastern portion of Long Island from east of Fire Island to Port Jefferson . In anticipation for the storm , the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency was activated as a trial run for the hurricane season . Local Red Cross chapters were opened , as well , with two volunteer teams placed on standby to assist . Across southeastern Massachusetts , police departments maintained extra staff in preparation for any potential problems from the storm . Many fishermen secured their boats , while some business owners boarded up windows to prevent storm damage . 
 Several days prior to the passage of Beryl through Atlantic Canada , the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued gale warnings for the coastal waters off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland . In anticipation of heavy rainfall , the agency also issued heavy rainfall warnings for western Nova Scotia , including Halifax . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The storm caused high waves along the East Coast of the United States , with 19 @-@ foot seas ( 5 @.@ 97 m ) in the open ocean . Waves along the southern coast of Nantucket reached 10 feet ( 3 m ) in height as the storm approached the island , resulting in four people being rescued by lifeguards from rip currents . High surf also occurred along the southern coast of Massachusetts , prompting the closing of the ferry between Nantucket and Boston . Beryl produced a storm surge of 0 @.@ 9 feet ( <unk> m ) on Nantucket . Winds across southeastern Massachusetts were fairly light , with no sustained tropical storm force winds and wind gusts peaking at 44 mph ( 71 km / h ) ; unofficially gusts reached 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) . Beryl dropped moderate precipitation just offshore , though the maximum precipitation total in the United States was only 0 @.@ 97 inches ( 24 @.@ 6 mm ) on Nantucket . Rainfall along southeastern Massachusetts reached 0 @.@ 33 inches ( 8 @.@ 38 mm ) at Chatham . The only reported damage were some downed telephone poles and fallen tree branches . Overall impact was minor ; there were no reported power outages , deaths , injuries , or maritime emergencies in association with the storm . 
 The remnants of Beryl dropped moderate precipitation in Atlantic Canada , officially peaking at 2 @.@ 8 inches ( 71 mm ) in Scots Bay , Nova Scotia with an unofficially higher total of 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 88 mm ) ; in some locations 1 inch of rain fell in an hour . Additionally , a station in Fredericton , New Brunswick reported 1 @.@ 77 inches ( 45 mm ) in two hours . The rainfall caused some flooding , with some overflown streams flooding some streets . Moderate winds were reported along its path , which peaked at 60 mph ( 96 km / h ) in southern Nova Scotia . The winds downed some tree limbs and led to some power outages . Overall damage was minor . 
 = Weak interaction = 
 In particle physics , the weak interaction , the weak force or weak nuclear force , is one of the four known fundamental interactions of nature , alongside the strong interaction , electromagnetism , and gravitation . The weak interaction is responsible for radioactive decay , which plays an essential role in nuclear fission . The theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum <unk> ( <unk> ) , in analogy with the terms QCD and QED , but the term is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro @-@ weak theory ( <unk> ) . 
 In the Standard Model of particle physics , the weak interaction is caused by the emission or absorption of the force carriers , the W and Z bosons . All known fermions interact through the weak interaction . <unk> are particles that have half @-@ integer spin . Spin is one of the fundamental properties of particles . A fermion can be an elementary particle , such as the electron , or it can be a composite particle , such as the proton . The masses of W + , W − , and Z bosons are each far greater than that of interacting protons or neutrons , which is consistent with the short range of the weak force . The force is termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force . 
 During the quark epoch of the early universe , the electroweak force separated into the electromagnetic and weak forces . Important examples of the weak interaction include beta decay , and the fusion of hydrogen into deuterium that powers the Sun 's thermonuclear process . Most fermions will decay by a weak interaction over time . Such decay makes radiocarbon dating possible , as carbon @-@ 14 decays through the weak interaction to nitrogen @-@ 14 . It can also create radioluminescence , commonly used in tritium illumination , and in the related field of <unk> . 
 Quarks , which make up composite particles like neutrons and protons , come in six " flavours " – up , down , strange , charm , top and bottom – which give those composite particles their properties . The weak interaction is unique in that it allows for quarks to swap their flavour for another . The swapping of those properties is mediated by the force carrier bosons . For example , during beta minus decay , a down quark within a neutron is changed into an up quark , converting the neutron to a proton and resulting in the emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino . Also , the weak interaction is the only fundamental interaction that breaks parity @-@ symmetry , and similarly , the only one to break charge parity symmetry . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1933 , Enrico Fermi proposed the first theory of the weak interaction , known as Fermi 's interaction . He suggested that beta decay could be explained by a four @-@ fermion interaction , involving a contact force with no range . 
 However , it is better described as a non @-@ contact force field having a finite range , albeit very short . In 1968 , Sheldon Glashow , Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg unified the electromagnetic force and the weak interaction by showing them to be two aspects of a single force , now termed the electro @-@ weak force . 
 The existence of the W and Z bosons was not directly confirmed until 1983 . 
 = = Properties = = 
 The weak interaction is unique in a number of respects : 
 It is the only interaction capable of changing the flavor of quarks ( i.e. , of changing one type of quark into another ) . 
 It is the only interaction that violates P or parity @-@ symmetry . It is also the only one that violates CP symmetry . 
 It is propagated by force carrier particles that have significant masses , an unusual feature which is explained in the Standard Model by the Higgs mechanism . 
 Due to their large mass ( approximately 90 GeV / c2 ) these carrier particles , termed the W and Z bosons , are short @-@ lived with a lifetime of under 10 − 24 seconds . The weak interaction has a coupling constant ( an indicator of interaction strength ) of between 10 − 7 and 10 − 6 , compared to the strong interaction 's coupling constant of 1 and the electromagnetic coupling constant of about 10 − 2 ; consequently the weak interaction is weak in terms of strength . The weak interaction has a very short range ( around 10 − 17 to 10 − 16 m ) . At distances around 10 − 18 meters , the weak interaction has a strength of a similar magnitude to the electromagnetic force , but this starts to decrease exponentially with increasing distance . At distances of around 3 × 10 − 17 m , the weak interaction is 10 @,@ 000 times weaker than the electromagnetic . 
 The weak interaction affects all the fermions of the Standard Model , as well as the Higgs boson ; neutrinos interact through gravity and the weak interaction only , and neutrinos were the original reason for the name weak force . The weak interaction does not produce bound states ( nor does it involve binding energy ) – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale , that the electromagnetic force does at the atomic level , and that the strong nuclear force does inside nuclei . 
 Its most noticeable effect is due to its first unique feature : flavor changing . A neutron , for example , is heavier than a proton ( its sister nucleon ) , but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the flavor ( type ) of one of its two down quarks to an up quark . Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing , so this proceeds by weak decay ; without weak decay , quark properties such as strangeness and charm ( associated with the quarks of the same name ) would also be conserved across all interactions . All mesons are unstable because of weak decay . In the process known as beta decay , a down quark in the neutron can change into an up quark by emitting a virtual W − boson which is then converted into an electron and an electron antineutrino . Another example is the electron capture , a common variant of radioactive decay , wherein a proton and an electron within an atom interact , and are changed to a neutron ( an up quark is changed to a down quark ) and an electron neutrino is emitted . 
 Due to the large mass of a boson , weak decay occurs more slowly . Hence , weak decay is much less likely to occur before either strong or electromagnetic decay , as they proceed more rapidly . For example , a neutral pion ( which decays electromagnetically ) has a life of about 10 − 16 seconds , while a charged pion ( which decays through the weak interaction ) lives about 10 − 8 seconds , a hundred million times longer . In contrast , a free neutron ( which also decays through the weak interaction ) lives about 15 minutes . 
 = = = Weak isospin and weak hypercharge = = = 
 All particles have a property called weak isospin ( T3 ) , which serves as a quantum number and governs how that particle behaves in the weak interaction . Weak isospin plays the same role in the weak interaction as does electric charge in electromagnetism , and color charge in the strong interaction . All fermions have a weak isospin value of either + 1 ⁄ 2 or − 1 ⁄ 2 . For example , the up quark has a T3 of + 1 ⁄ 2 and the down quark − 1 ⁄ 2 . A quark never decays through the weak interaction into a quark of the same T3 : quarks with a T3 of + 1 ⁄ 2 decay into quarks with a T3 of − 1 ⁄ 2 and vice versa . 
 In any given interaction , weak isospin is conserved : the sum of the weak isospin numbers of the particles entering the interaction equals the sum of the weak isospin numbers of the particles exiting that interaction . For example , a ( left @-@ handed ) π + , with a weak isospin of 1 normally decays into a ν 
 μ ( + 1 / 2 ) and a μ + ( as a right @-@ handed antiparticle , + 1 / 2 ) . 
 Following the development of the electroweak theory , another property , weak hypercharge , was developed . It is dependent on a particle 's electrical charge and weak isospin , and is defined as : 
 <formula> 
 where <unk> is the weak hypercharge of a given type of particle , Q is its electrical charge ( in elementary charge units ) and T3 is its weak isospin . Whereas some particles have a weak isospin of zero , all particles , except gluons , have non @-@ zero weak hypercharge . Weak hypercharge is the generator of the U ( 1 ) component of the electroweak gauge group . 
 = = Interaction types = = 
 There are two types of weak interaction ( called vertices ) . The first type is called the " charged @-@ current interaction " because it is mediated by particles that carry an electric charge ( the W + or W − bosons ) , and is responsible for the beta decay phenomenon . The second type is called the " neutral @-@ current interaction " because it is mediated by a neutral particle , the Z boson . 
 = = = Charged @-@ current interaction = = = 
 In one type of charged current interaction , a charged lepton ( such as an electron or a muon , having a charge of − 1 ) can absorb a W + boson ( a particle with a charge of + 1 ) and be thereby converted into a corresponding neutrino ( with a charge of 0 ) , where the type ( " flavour " ) of neutrino ( electron , muon or tau ) is the same as the type of lepton in the interaction , for example : 
 <formula> 
 Similarly , a down @-@ type quark ( d with a charge of − 1 ⁄ 3 ) can be converted into an up @-@ type quark ( u , with a charge of + 2 ⁄ 3 ) , by emitting a W − boson or by absorbing a W + boson . More precisely , the down @-@ type quark becomes a quantum superposition of up @-@ type quarks : that is to say , it has a possibility of becoming any one of the three up @-@ type quarks , with the probabilities given in the CKM matrix tables . Conversely , an up @-@ type quark can emit a W + boson , or absorb a W − boson , and thereby be converted into a down @-@ type quark , for example : 
 <formula> 
 The W boson is unstable so will rapidly decay , with a very short lifetime . For example : 
 <formula> 
 Decay of the W boson to other products can happen , with varying probabilities . 
 In the so @-@ called beta decay of a neutron ( see picture , above ) , a down quark within the neutron emits a virtual W − boson and is thereby converted into an up quark , converting the neutron into a proton . Because of the energy involved in the process ( i.e. , the mass difference between the down quark and the up quark ) , the W − boson can only be converted into an electron and an electron @-@ antineutrino . At the quark level , the process can be represented as : 
 <formula> 
 = = = Neutral @-@ current interaction = = = 
 In neutral current interactions , a quark or a lepton ( e.g. , an electron or a muon ) emits or absorbs a neutral Z boson . For example : 
 <formula> 
 Like the W boson , the Z boson also decays rapidly , for example : 
 <formula> 
 = = <unk> theory = = 
 The Standard Model of particle physics describes the electromagnetic interaction and the weak interaction as two different aspects of a single electroweak interaction , the theory of which was developed around 1968 by Sheldon Glashow , Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg . They were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work . The Higgs mechanism provides an explanation for the presence of three massive gauge bosons ( the three carriers of the weak interaction ) and the massless photon of the electromagnetic interaction . 
 According to the electroweak theory , at very high energies , the universe has four massless gauge boson fields similar to the photon and a complex scalar Higgs field doublet . However , at low energies , gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the U ( 1 ) symmetry of electromagnetism ( one of the Higgs fields acquires a vacuum expectation value ) . This symmetry breaking would produce three massless bosons , but they become integrated by three photon @-@ like fields ( through the Higgs mechanism ) giving them mass . These three fields become the W + , W − and Z bosons of the weak interaction , while the fourth gauge field , which remains massless , is the photon of electromagnetism . 
 This theory has made a number of predictions , including a prediction of the masses of the Z and W bosons before their discovery . On 4 July 2012 , the CMS and the <unk> experimental teams at the Large Hadron Collider independently announced that they had confirmed the formal discovery of a previously unknown boson of mass between 125 – 127 GeV / c2 , whose behaviour so far was " consistent with " a Higgs boson , while adding a cautious note that further data and analysis were needed before positively identifying the new boson as being a Higgs boson of some type . By 14 March 2013 , the Higgs boson was tentatively confirmed to exist . 
 = = Violation of symmetry = = 
 The laws of nature were long thought to remain the same under mirror reflection . The results of an experiment viewed via a mirror were expected to be identical to the results of a mirror @-@ reflected copy of the experimental apparatus . This so @-@ called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation , electromagnetism and the strong interaction ; it was assumed to be a universal law . However , in the mid @-@ 1950s Chen Ning Yang and Tsung @-@ Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law . Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity , earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics . 
 Although the weak interaction was once described by Fermi 's theory , the discovery of parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed . In 1957 , Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and , somewhat later , Richard Feynman and Murray Gell @-@ Mann proposed a V − A ( vector minus axial vector or left @-@ handed ) Lagrangian for weak interactions . In this theory , the weak interaction acts only on left @-@ handed particles ( and right @-@ handed antiparticles ) . Since the mirror reflection of a left @-@ handed particle is right @-@ handed , this explains the maximal violation of parity . Interestingly , the V − A theory was developed before the discovery of the Z boson , so it did not include the right @-@ handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction . 
 However , this theory allowed a compound symmetry CP to be conserved . CP combines parity P ( switching left to right ) with charge conjugation C ( switching particles with antiparticles ) . Physicists were again surprised when in 1964 , James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too , winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics . In 1973 , Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required more than two generations of particles , effectively predicting the existence of a then unknown third generation . This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics . Unlike parity violation , CP violation occurs in only a small number of instances , but remains widely held as an answer to the difference between the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe ; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov 's three conditions for baryogenesis .

It runs from U.S. Route 60 ( US 60 ) in Apache Junction through desert terrain to SR 188 near Roosevelt Dam . Following the Salt River for much of its length , the section east of Tortilla Flat is known as the Apache Trail and is part of the National Forest Scenic Byway system . The Apache Trail was built in the mid @-@ 1920s and the number 88 was assigned in 1927 . An eastern extension of SR 88 to Globe was redesignated as SR 188 in the late 1990s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 88 begins at a diamond interchange with US 60 , the Superstition Freeway , in southern Apache Junction . The route follows Idaho Road northward through a residential area with four lanes . Following a junction with Old West Highway , SR 88 turns northeast onto Apache Trail and narrows to two lanes . The route exits the city limits of Apache Junction , entering desert terrain . Passing a ghost town known as Goldfield , Apache Trail enters Tonto National Forest just northwest of Lost Dutchman State Park . SR 88 nears Canyon Lake south of the Mormon Flat Dam and follows a part of the southern coast of Canyon Lake . Apache Trail heads away from the Salt River . It passes through the town of Tortilla Flat , becoming an unpaved dirt trail winding eastward through the Superstition Mountains . SR 88 again turns northeast and nears Apache Lake . The route follows the Salt River northeast to the Theodore Roosevelt Dam , near which the route is again paved . SR 88 intersects with SR 188 along the coast of Theodore Roosevelt Lake . 
 The highway is maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation ( ADOT ) , which is responsible for maintaining highways in the state , including SR 88 . As part of this role , ADOT periodically surveys traffic along its routes . These surveys are presented in the form of average annual daily traffic , which is the number of vehicles who use the route on any average day during the year . In 2009 , ADOT calculated that around as few as 400 vehicles used the route daily near the Roosevelt Dam and as many as 16 @,@ 000 daily at the US 60 interchange in Apache Junction . The section east of Canyon Lake is part of the Apache Trail National Forest Scenic Byway system . No part of the highway has been listed in the National Highway System , a system of roads in the United States important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 = = History = = 
 The Apache Trail connected the Old Spanish Trail where Apache Junction is today and Roosevelt Lake with an unpaved road as early as 1925 , following much of the modern route . By the next year , SR 66 followed the Apache Trail and the Old Spanish Trail was numbered as US 80 . The number 88 was given to the route by 1927 , but continued past its current terminus east to US 180 west of Globe . US 60 and US 89 became concurrent with US 80 at the western terminus by 1935 , and the US 70 designation was added to the road by 1939 . The section of the route from Apache Junction to Canyon Lake was paved in the late 1940s . By 1958 , the section east of Roosevelt Dam was paved . The extra designations at SR 88 's western terminus were removed by 1971 , leaving only the US 60 designation . In 1999 , the section east of Roosevelt Dam was renumbered as SR 188 , cutting SR 88 back to its current terminus .

 The Great American Bash ( 2007 ) was the fourth annual Great American Bash professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) . It was presented by <unk> and took place on July 22 , 2007 from the HP Pavilion in San Jose , California and featured talent from the Raw , SmackDown ! , and ECW brands . 
 The main match on the Raw brand was John Cena versus Bobby Lashley for the WWE Championship , which Cena won by pinfall after executing an FU on Lashley from the second rope . The predominant match on the SmackDown ! brand was a Triple Threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship between The Great Khali , Batista and Kane . Khali won the match and retained the title after pinning Kane . The primary match on the ECW brand was John Morrison versus CM Punk for the ECW Championship , which Morrison won by pinfall after hitting Punk with both of his knees . The featured matches on the undercard included Montel Vontavious Porter versus Matt Hardy for the WWE United States Championship and Randy Orton versus Dusty Rhodes in a Texas Bullrope match . This was Dusty Rhodes final match . The event had 229 @,@ 000 buys , up slightly on the 2006 figure of 227 @,@ 000 buys .

 The main feud heading into The Great American Bash on the Raw brand was between John Cena and Bobby Lashley over the WWE Championship . The feud began on the June 11 , 2007 edition of Raw , when Lashley was drafted to the Raw brand and stripped of his ECW Championship . Three weeks later , on the July 2 edition of Raw , a " Beat the Clock " tournament was held to determine Cena 's opponent for the WWE Championship at The Great American Bash . The tournament matches included : Randy Orton versus Jeff Hardy , King Booker versus Val Venis , Mr. Kennedy versus Super Crazy , and Lashley versus Shelton Benjamin . Lashley ended up winning the tournament by defeating Benjamin in less than 5 minutes and therefore becoming the number one contender to the WWE Championship . 
 The main feud on the SmackDown ! brand was between The Great Khali , Batista , and Kane , with the three battling over the World Heavyweight Championship . At the previous pay @-@ per @-@ view , Vengeance , then @-@ World Heavyweight Champion Edge defeated Batista in a " Last Chance " match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship . On the July 6 edition of SmackDown ! , SmackDown ! General Manager Theodore Long announced that Edge would be defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Kane at The Great American Bash . The next week on SmackDown ! , The Great Khali issued an open challenge for a match at The Great American Bash , which was accepted by Batista . Later that night , Edge legitimately injured his left pectoral muscle after Kane , who was disguised as a character , attacked Edge during his Mardi Gras celebration . On the July 20 edition of SmackDown ! , Edge was forced to vacate the World Heavyweight Championship due to his legit injury . Theodore Long then announced that there would be a 20 @-@ man Battle Royal later that night to determine a new World Heavyweight Champion . Khali ended up winning the Battle Royal by last eliminating Kane and Batista . That same night , Kane faced off against Batista to determine Khali 's opponent for The Great American Bash , which ended in a no @-@ contest after Khali interfered . Long finalized that both Kane and Batista would end up facing Khali for the championship at The Great American Bash . 
 The main feud on the ECW brand was between John Morrison and CM Punk with the two battling over the ECW Championship . At Vengeance , Morrison ( then known as Johnny Nitro ) defeated Punk to win the ECW Championship , which was vacant since then @-@ champion Lashley had been drafted to the Raw brand . Nitro was a replacement for Chris Benoit , who was absent due to " personal reasons . " On the June 26 edition of ECW , CM Punk defeated Elijah Burke in a two out of three falls match to once again become the number one contender to the ECW Championship .

 High Speed 1 ( HS1 ) , legally the Channel Tunnel Rail Link ( CTRL ) , is a 109 @-@ kilometre ( 68 mi ) high @-@ speed railway between London and the United Kingdom end of the Channel Tunnel . 
 The line carries international passenger traffic between the United Kingdom and Continental Europe ; it also carries domestic passenger traffic to and from stations in Kent and east London and Berne gauge freight traffic . The line crosses the River Medway and under the River Thames , terminating at St Pancras railway station on the north side of central London . It cost £ 5 @.@ 8 billion to build and opened on 14 November 2007 . Trains reach speeds of up to 300 kilometres per hour ( 186 mph ) on section 1 and up to 230 kilometres per hour ( 143 mph ) on section 2 . Intermediate stations are at Stratford International in London and Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International in Kent . 
 International passenger services are provided by Eurostar , with journey times of London St Pancras to Paris Gare du Nord in 2 hours 15 minutes , and St Pancras to Brussels @-@ South in 1 hour 51 minutes . Eurostar uses a fleet of 27 Class 373 / 1 multi @-@ system trains capable of 300 kilometres per hour ( 186 mph ) and 320 kilometres per hour ( 199 mph ) Class 374 from November 2015 . Domestic high @-@ speed commuter services serving the intermediate stations and beyond began on 13 December 2009 . The fleet of 29 Class 395 passenger trains reach speeds of 225 kilometres per hour ( 140 mph ) . DB Cargo UK run freight services on High Speed 1 using adapted Class 92 locomotives , enabling flat wagons carrying continental @-@ size swap body containers to reach London for the first time . 
 The CTRL project saw new bridges and tunnels built , with a combined length nearly as long as the Channel Tunnel itself , and significant archaeological research undertaken . In 2002 , the CTRL project was awarded the Major Project Award at the British Construction Industry Awards . The line was transferred to government ownership in 2009 , with a 30 @-@ year concession for its operation being put up for sale in June 2010 . The concession was awarded to a consortium of Borealis Infrastructure ( part of Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System ) and Ontario Teachers ' Pension Plan in November 2010 , but does not include the freehold or rights to any of the associated land . 
 = = Early history = = 
 A high @-@ speed rail line , LGV Nord , has been in operation between the Channel Tunnel and the outskirts of Paris since the Tunnel 's opening in 1994 . This has enabled Eurostar rail services to travel at 300 km / h ( 186 mph ) for this part of their journey . A similar high @-@ speed line in Belgium , from the French border to Brussels , HSL 1 , opened in 1997 . In Britain , Eurostar trains had to run at a maximum of 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) on existing tracks between London Waterloo and the Channel Tunnel . These tracks were shared with local traffic , limiting the number of services that could be run , and jeopardising reliability . The case for a high @-@ speed line similar to the continental part of the route was recognised by policymakers , and the construction of the line was authorised by Parliament with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996 , which was amended by the Channel Tunnel Rail Link ( Supplementary Provisions ) Act 2008 . 
 An early plan conceived by British Rail in the early 1970s for a route passing through Tonbridge met considerable opposition on environmental and social grounds , especially from the Leigh Action Group and Surrey & Kent Action on Rail ( <unk> ) . A committee was set up to examine the proposal under Sir Alexander Cairncross ; but in due course environment minister Anthony Crosland announced that the project had been cancelled , together with the plan for the tunnel itself . 
 The next plan for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link involved a tunnel reaching London from the south @-@ east , and an underground terminus in the vicinity of Kings Cross station . A late change in the plans , principally driven by the then Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine 's desire for urban regeneration in east London , led to a change of route , with the new line approaching London from the east . This opened the possibility of reusing the underused St Pancras station as the terminus , with access via the North London Line that crosses the throat of the station . 
 The idea of using the North London line proved illusory , and it was rejected in 1994 by the then Transport Secretary , John MacGregor , as too difficult to construct and environmentally damaging . The idea of using St Pancras station as the core of the new terminus was retained , albeit now linked by 20 kilometres ( 12 miles ) of specially built tunnels to Dagenham via Stratford . 
 London and Continental Railways ( LCR ) was chosen by the UK government in 1996 to build the line and to reconstruct St Pancras station as its terminus , and to take over the British share of the Eurostar operation , Eurostar ( UK ) . The original LCR consortium members were National Express Group , Virgin Group , S. G. Warburg & Co , Bechtel and London Electric . While the project was under development by British Rail it was managed by Union Railways , which became a wholly owned subsidiary of LCR . On 14 November 2006 , LCR adopted High Speed 1 as the brand name for the completed railway . Official legislation , documentation and line @-@ side signage have continued to refer to " CTRL " . 
 = = The project = = 
 As the 1987 Channel Tunnel Act made government funding for a Channel tunnel rail link unlawful , construction did not take place as it was not financially viable . Construction was delayed until passage of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996 which provided construction powers that ran for the following 10 years . The chief executive of the time Rob Holden stated that it was the " largest land acquisition programme since the Second World War " . 
 The whole route was to have been built as a single project , but in 1998 serious financial difficulties arose , and extensive changes came with a British government rescue plan . To reduce risk , the line was split into two separate phases , to be managed by Union Railways ( South ) and Union Railways ( North ) . A recovery programme was agreed whereby LCR sold government @-@ backed bonds worth £ 1 @.@ 6 billion to pay for the construction of section 1 , with the future of section 2 still not settled . 
 The original intention had been for the new railway , once completed , to be run by Union Railways as a separate line from the rest of the British railway network . As part of the 1998 rescue it was agreed that , following completion , section 1 would be purchased by Railtrack with an option to purchase section 2 . In return , Railtrack was committed to operate the whole route as well as St Pancras railway station , which , unlike all other former British Rail stations , had been transferred to LCR / Union Railways in 1996 . 
 In 2001 , Railtrack announced that , due to its own financial problems , it would not undertake to purchase section 2 , triggering a second restructuring . The 2002 plan agreed that the two sections would have different owners ( Railtrack for section 1 , LCR for section 2 ) but with common Railtrack management . Following further financial problems at Railtrack , its interest was sold back to LCR , which then sold the operating rights for the completed line to Network Rail , Railtrack 's successor . Under this arrangement LCR became the sole owner of both sections of the CTRL and the St Pancras property , as per the original 1996 plan . Amendments were made in 2001 for the new station at Stratford International and connections to the West Coast Main Line . 
 As a consequence of the restructuring , in 2006 the LCR consortium consisted of engineering consultants and construction firms Arup , Bechtel , Halcrow and <unk> ( which form Rail Link Engineering ( <unk> ) ) ; transport operators National Express Group and SNCF ( which operates the Eurostar ( UK ) share of the Eurostar service with the National Railway Company of Belgium and British Airways ) ; electricity company EDF ; and UBS Investment Bank . On completion of section 1 by <unk> , the line was handed over to Union Railways ( South ) , which then handed it over to London & Continental Stations and Property ( <unk> ) , the long @-@ term owners of the line . Once section 2 of the line had been completed it was handed over to Union Railways ( North ) , which handed it over to <unk> . The entire line , including St Pancras , is managed , operated and maintained by Network Rail ( CTRL ) . 
 In February 2006 there were rumours that a ' third party ' ( believed to be a consortium headed by banker Sir Adrian Montague ) had expressed an interest in buying out the present partners in the project . LCR shareholders rejected the proposal , and the government , which effectively could overrule shareholders ' decisions as a result of LCR 's reclassification as a state @-@ owned body , decided that discussions with shareholders would not take place imminently , effectively backing shareholders ' views on the proposed takeover . 
 By May 2009 LCR had become insolvent and the government received agreement to use state aid to purchase the line and also to open it up to competition to allow other services to use it apart from Eurostar . LCR 's hitherto wholly owned subsidiary , HS1 Ltd , thus became the property of the Secretary of State for Transport . On 12 October 2009 a proposal was announced to sell £ 16 billion of state assets including HS1 Ltd in the following two years to cut UK public debt . The government announced on 5 November 2010 that a concession to operate the line for 30 years had been sold for £ 2 @.@ 1 billion to a consortium of Canadian investors . Under the concession , HS1 Ltd has the rights to sell access to track and to the four international stations ( St Pancras , Stratford , Ebbsfleet and Ashford ) on a commercial basis , under the scrutiny of the Office of Rail Regulation . At the end of 30 years , ownership of the assets will revert to government .

 Section 1 of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link , opened on 28 September 2003 , is a 74 @-@ kilometre ( 46 mi ) section of high @-@ speed track from the Channel Tunnel to Fawkham Junction in north Kent with a maximum speed of 300 kilometres per hour ( 186 mph ) . Its completion cut the London – Paris journey time by around 21 minutes , to 2 hours 35 minutes . The line includes the Medway Viaduct , a 1 @.@ 2 km ( ¾ mile ) bridge over the River Medway , and the North Downs Tunnel , a 3 @.@ 2 km ( 2 @.@ 0 mi ) long , 12 m ( 40 ft ) diameter tunnel . In safety testing on the section prior to opening , a new UK rail speed record of 334 @.@ 7 km / h ( 208 @.@ 0 mph ) was set . Much of the new line runs alongside the M2 and M20 motorways through Kent . After its completion , Eurostar trains continued to use suburban lines to enter London , arriving at Waterloo International . 
 There were several deaths of employees working on the CTRL over the construction period . One occurred on 28 March 2003 near Folkestone when a worker came into contact with the energised power supply . Another death occurred two months later , in May 2003 , when a <unk> fell seven metres at Thurrock , Essex . Three companies were found guilty of breaching health and safety legislation by omitting to provide barriers , resulting in <unk> Direct Ltd being ordered to pay a fine of £ 50 @,@ 000 , J Murphy and Sons Ltd £ 25 @,@ 000 , and Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft £ 25 @,@ 000 . Two more deaths relate to a fire on board a train carrying wires , one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) inside a tunnel under the Thames between <unk> , Kent , and Thurrock , Essex on 16 August 2005 . The train shunter died at the scene and the train driver later died in hospital . It has been suggested that a large amount of blame for accidents throughout the project lay with individual behaviour , becoming such a problem that an internal programme was launched to tackle behaviour problems during the construction . 
 Unlike most LGV stations in France , the through tracks for Ashford International station are off to one side rather than going through , partly due to Ashford International predating the line . High Speed 1 approaches Ashford International from the north in a cut @-@ and @-@ cover " box " ; the southbound line rises out of this cutting and crosses over the main tracks to enter the station . The main tracks then rise out of the cutting and over a flyover . On leaving Ashford , southbound <unk> return to the high @-@ speed line by travelling under this flyover and joining from the outside . The international platforms at Ashford are supplied with both overhead 25 kV and 3rd rail 750 V , avoiding the need to switch power supplies .

 Section 2 of the project opened on 14 November 2007 and is a 39 @.@ 4 km ( 24 @.@ 5 mi ) stretch of track from the newly built Ebbsfleet station in Kent to London St Pancras with a maximum speed of 230 kilometres per hour ( 143 mph ) . Completion of the section cut journey times by a further 20 minutes ( London – Paris in <unk> 15 m ; London – Brussels in 1h 51 m ) . The route starts with a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) tunnel which dives under the Thames on the edge of <unk> , then runs alongside the London , Tilbury and Southend Railway as far as Dagenham , where it enters a 19 @-@ kilometre ( 12 mi ) tunnel ( 51 ° 31 ′ 36 @.@ 9 ″ N 0 ° 8 ′ 13 @.@ 9 ″ E ) , much of which is directly under the North London Line , before emerging over the East Coast Main Line near St Pancras . The tunnels are divided into London East and London West sections , between which a 1 @-@ kilometre stretch runs close to the surface to serve Stratford International and the Temple Mills Depot . 
 The new depot at Temple Mills , to the north of Stratford , replaced the North Pole depot in the west of London . In testing , the first Eurostar train ran in St Pancras on 6 March 2007 . All CTRL connections are fully grade @-@ separated . This is achieved through use of viaducts , bridges , cuttings and in one case , the tunnel portal itself .

In addition , it retained traditional domestic connections to the north and south of England . The new extension doubled the length of the central platforms now used for Eurostar services ; new platforms have been provided for existing domestic East Midlands Trains and the Southeastern high @-@ speed services that run along High Speed 1 to Kent . New platforms on the Thameslink line across London were built beneath the western margins of the station , and the station at King 's Cross Thameslink was closed . 
 A complex junction has been built north of St Pancras with connections to the East Coast Main Line , North London Line ( for West Coast Main Line ) and Midland Main Line , allowing for a wide variety of potential destinations albeit on conventional rails . As part of the works , tunnels connecting the East Coast Main Line to the Thameslink route were also built in readiness for the forthcoming Thameslink Programme .

 The track is 1 @,@ 435 mm ( 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ) standard gauge cleared to a larger modern European GC loading gauge enabling GC gauge freight as far as the yards at Barking . The line is electrified entirely using overhead lines with 25 kV AC railway electrification .

 After local protests , early plans were modified to put more of the route into tunnels up until a point approximately 1 mile ( 2 km ) from St. Pancras . Previously the CTRL was planned to run on an elevated section alongside the North London Line on approach into the line 's terminus . The twin tunnels bored under London were driven from Stratford westwards towards St Pancras , eastwards towards Dagenham and from Dagenham westwards to connect with the tunnel from Stratford . The tunnel boring machines were 120 metres long and weighed 1 @,@ 100 tonnes . The depth of the tunnels varies from 24 metres to 50 metres . 
 The construction works were complex , and many contractors were involved in delivering them . The CTRL Section 2 construction works had caused considerable disruption around the Kings Cross area of London ; in their wake redevelopment was stimulated . The large redevelopment area includes the run @-@ down areas of post @-@ industrial and ex @-@ railway land close to King 's Cross and St Pancras , a conservation area with many listed buildings ; this was promoted as one of the benefits for building the CTRL . It has been postulated that this development was actually suppressed by the construction project , and some affected districts were said still to be in a poor state in 2005 . 
 = = = Connection line to Waterloo = = = 
 A 4 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) connecting line providing access for Waterloo railway station leaves High Speed 1 at <unk> Junction using a grade @-@ separated junction ; the main CTRL tracks continue uninterrupted through to CTRL Section 2 underneath the southbound flyover . The connection joins the Chatham Main Line at Fawkham Junction with a flat crossing . The retention of Eurostar services to Waterloo after the line to St Pancras opened was ruled out on cost grounds . Waterloo International closed upon opening of the section two of the CTRL in November 2007 ; Eurostar now serves the refurbished St Pancras as its only London terminal , so this connecting line is no longer used in regular service , but can be used in emergencies by Class 395 passenger trains .

 High Speed 1 was built to allow eight trains per hour through to the Channel Tunnel . As of May 2014 , Eurostar runs two to three trains per hour in each direction between London and the Channel Tunnel . Southeastern runs in the high peak eight trains per hour between London and Ebbsfleet , two of these continuing to Ashford . During the 2012 Olympic Games , Southeastern provided the Olympic Javelin service with up to twelve trains per hour from Stratford into London . 
 = = = Freight = = = 
 The route was built with freight provision from the beginning . It has spurs leading to and from the freight terminal at <unk> Moor ( Folkestone ) and the freight depot at Barking ( Ripple Lane ) , north of the River Thames . Long passing loops to hold freight trains while passenger trains overtake them were built at Lenham Heath and Singlewell . 
 Freight trains operated by <unk> first ran over CTRL Section 1 , on the consecutive evenings of 3 – 4 April 2004 . Five freight trains that would have run via the classic lines were diverted to run over the Channel Tunnel Rail Link instead : three southbound intermodal trains on 3 April 2004 and two northbound intermodal trains on 4 April 2004 .

Network Rail ( CTRL ) Limited was created as a subsidiary of Network Rail on 26 September 2003 for £ 57 million to take over the assets of the CTRL renewal and maintenance operations . Network Rail ( High Speed ) operates engineering , track maintenance machines , rescue locomotives , and <unk> and test trains . Eurotunnel 's subsidiary <unk> 2 operates its Eurotunnel Class 0001 ( Krupp / MaK 6400 ) rescue locomotives on the line when required . 
 Various track recording trains run as necessary , including visits by the New Measurement Train . On the night of 4 / 5 May 2011 the SNCF TGV Iris 320 laboratory train took over , being hauled from <unk> to St Pancras and back , towed by Eurotunnel Krupp locomotives numbers 4 and 5 .

 The Eurostar service uses about 40 % of the capacity of High Speed 1 , which in November 2007 became the company 's route for all its services . Eurostar trains are for international traffic only , passing along the high @-@ speed line from London St Pancras railway station to the Channel Tunnel , with the majority terminating at either Paris Gare du Nord in France or Brussels @-@ South railway station in Belgium . Currently the trains operated by Eurostar are the only ones to make full use of the high speeds on the line ; a Eurostar train was used to set a new British rail speed record of 334 @.@ 7 km / h ( 208 mph ) on 30 July 2003 . Prior to the formation of Eurostar International Limited , the British component of the Eurostar grouping was owned by London and Continental Railways , which had also previously owned the High Speed 1 infrastructure . 
 The fastest regular @-@ service Eurostar journeys on record are 2 hours , 3 minutes and 39 seconds from Paris Gare du Nord to St Pancras , set on 4 September 2007 ; and 1 hour 43 minutes from Brussels South to St. Pancras , set on 19 September 2007 .

 Domestic high @-@ speed services on High Speed 1 are operated by Southeastern . Having been in planning since 2004 , a preview service of the British Rail Class 395 trains , popularly known as Javelins , started in June 2009 , and regular services began on 13 December 2009 . The quickest journey time from Ashford to London St Pancras is 35 minutes , compared with 80 minutes for the service to London Charing Cross via Tonbridge . This service on Section 2 of the CTRL , known previously as CTRL @-@ DS , was a factor in London 's successful 2012 Olympic Bid , promising a seven @-@ minute journey time from the Olympic Park at Stratford to the London terminus at St Pancras . Although the Class 395 has a maximum speed of 225 km / h ( 140 mph ) , for timetabling purposes a 10 % lower speed is assumed . These trains have faster acceleration than the Eurostar units .

 DB Cargo is a global freight operator with a large interest in freight over rail in Europe . While High Speed 1 was constructed with freight loops , no freight traffic had run upon the line since opening in 2003 . On 16 April 2009 DB Schenker signed an agreement with HS1 Ltd , the owner of High Speed 1 , for a partnership to develop TVM modifications for class 92 freight locomotives to run on the line . On 25 March 2011 for the first time a modified class 92 locomotive travelled from <unk> Moor to Singlewell using the <unk> signalling system . A loaded container train ran for the first time on 27 May 2011 , to Novara in Italy . Following further trials with loaded wagons DB is to upgrade five Class 92 locomotives to allow them to run on High Speed 1 . From 11 November 2011 a weekly service using European @-@ sized swap body containers has run between London and Poland using High Speed 1 .

 At present , only Deutsche Bahn has applied for use of the line and in 2009 regulations were relaxed to allow its trains to use the Channel Tunnel . Other proposals are yet to be formalised . 
 = = = = Deutsche Bahn = = = = 
 In November 2007 , it was reported that Deutsche Bahn , Germany 's national train company , had applied to use the Channel Tunnel and High Speed 1 into London . This was denied by Deutsche Bahn , and the bi @-@ national Channel Tunnel Safety Authority confirmed that it had not received such an application . The plan was delayed by safety regulations as Deutsche Bahn 's fleet of ICE 3M high @-@ speed trains could not be divided in the tunnel in an emergency . 
 In December 2008 , it was reported that Deutsche Bahn ( DB ) was interested in buying the British share in Eurostar , which in practice means buying Eurostar ( U.K. ) Ltd . , the 100 % subsidiary of London and Continental Railways ( LCR ) , which the British government intends to break up and sell just as it does the other rail @-@ related subsidiary of L & CR , HS1 Ltd . The buyer of EUKL would become the owner of the 11 British " Three Capitals " Class 373 trainsets plus all seven " North of London " sets , and would also be responsible for the operations of Eurostar traffic within Britain once the management contract with <unk> expires in 2010 . Guillaume <unk> , the president of SNCF , who held a press conference the same day , described DB 's interest as " premature , presumptuous and arrogant " . SNCF claims to own 62 % of the shares of Eurostar Group Ltd . Hartmut <unk> , then CEO of Deutsche Bahn , confirmed DB 's interest but insisted in a letter to <unk> that DB had only informally requested information and not made any official requests to Britain 's Department for Transport . 
 In 2009 , Eurotunnel ( the owners of the Channel Tunnel ) announced that it was prepared to start relaxing the fire safety regulations , in order to permit other operators , such as Deutsche Bahn , to transport passengers via the Tunnel using other forms of rolling stock . Under the deregulation of European railway service , high @-@ speed lines were opened up to access by other operators on 1 January 2010 ; the Inter @-@ Governmental Commission on the Channel Tunnel ( IGC ) announced that it was considering relaxing the safety requirements concerning train splitting . LCR suggested that high @-@ speed rail services between London and Cologne could commence before the 2012 Olympics . 
 In March 2010 Eurotunnel , HS1 Ltd , DB and other interested train operators formed a working group to discuss changes to the safety rules , including allowing 200 @-@ metre trains . The Intergovernmental Commission currently requires trains to be 400 m long . Deutsche Bahn carried out evacuation trials in the tunnel on 17 October 2010 with two 200m @-@ long <unk> trains , and displayed one of them at St Pancras station on 19 October . The current Velaro <unk> sets do not meet the fire safety requirements for passenger services through the tunnel , but the Siemens Velaro D sets on order include the necessary additional fire @-@ proofing . In March 2011 , the European Rail Agency decided to allow trains with distributed traction to operate in the Channel Tunnel . DB is planning three services a day to Frankfurt ( <unk> from London ) , Rotterdam ( 3h ) and Amsterdam ( <unk> ) via Brussels from 2015 . This had originally planned to be 2013 , but has been delayed due to the availability of the Channel Tunnel version of the Siemens Velaro D trains , high rental costs of the French rail network and border controls in their stations . As of 2016 , nothing yet has come to fruition , but the High Speed One website continues to state that " HS1 Ltd are working with Deutsche Bahn on plans to incorporate three additional international return journeys , between Frankfurt and London via Cologne , Brussels and Lille .

 = Felix of Burgundy = 
 Felix of Burgundy , also known as Felix of Dunwich ( died 8 March 647 or 648 ) , was a saint and the first bishop of the East Angles . He is widely credited as the man who introduced Christianity to the kingdom of East Anglia . Almost all that is known about the saint originates from The Ecclesiastical History of the English People , completed by Bede in about 731 , and the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . Bede praised Felix for delivering " all the province of East Anglia from long @-@ standing <unk> and unhappiness " . 
 Felix , who originated from the Frankish kingdom of Burgundy , may have been a priest at one of the monasteries in Francia founded by the Irish missionary Columbanus : the existence of a Bishop of Châlons with the same name may not be a coincidence . Felix travelled from his homeland of Burgundy to Canterbury before being sent by Honorius to Sigeberht of East Anglia 's kingdom in about 630 , ( by sea to Babingley in Norfolk , according to local legend ) . On arrival in East Anglia , Sigeberht gave him a see at Dommoc ( possibly Walton , Suffolk or Dunwich in Suffolk ) . According to Bede , Felix helped Sigeberht to establish a school in his kingdom " where boys could be taught letters " . He died on 8 March 647 or 648 , having been bishop for seventeen years . His relics were translated from Dommoc to Soham Abbey and then to the abbey at Ramsey . 
 After his death , Felix was venerated as a saint : several English churches are dedicated to him . Felix 's feast date is 8 March . 
 = = Background and early life = = 
 Felix came from the Frankish kingdom of Burgundy , although his name prevents historians from conclusively identifying his nationality . According to Bede , he was ordained in Burgundy . 
 It is possible that Felix was associated with Irish missionary activity in Francia , which was centred in Burgundy and was particularly associated with Columbanus and Luxeuil Abbey . Columbanus had arrived in Francia in about 590 , after leaving Bangor along with twelve companions and going into voluntary exile . Upon Columbanus 's arrival , he was encouraged to stay , and in about 592 settled at <unk> , but was then forced to find an alternative site for a monastery at Luxeuil , when lay people and the sick continually sought the counsel of himself and his fellow monks . 
 The connection between the Wuffingas ruling dynasty and the abbess <unk> at Faremoutiers Abbey was an example of the associations that existed at the time between the Church in East Anglia and religious establishments in Francia . Such associations were partly due to the work of Columbanus and his disciples at Luxeuil : together with <unk> , his successor , Columbanus inspired <unk> to found the abbey at Faremoutiers . It has been suggested that a connection between the disciples of Columbanus , ( who strongly influenced the Christians of Northern Burgundy ) and Felix , helps to explain how the Wuffingas dynasty established its links with Faremoutiers . Higham notes various suggestions for where Felix may have originated , including Luxeuil , Châlons or the area around Autun . Other historians have made connections between Felix and Dagobert I , who had contact with both King Sigeberht of East Anglia and Amandus , a disciple of Columbanus . 
 <unk> and Collins note that there was a bishop named Felix who held the see of Châlons in 626 or 627 . They suggest the possibility that Felix may have become a political fugitive as a result of losing his see at Châlons after the death of Chlothar II in 629 . 
 = = Arrival in the kingdom of the East Angles = = 
 Felix is mentioned in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , a collection of annals that was compiled in the late ninth century . The annal for 633 in ' Manuscript A ' of the Chronicle , states that Felix " preached the faith of Christ to the East Angles " . Another version of the Chronicle , ' Manuscript F ' , written in the eleventh century in both Old English and Latin , elaborates upon the short statement contained in the Manuscript A annal : 
 " Here there came from the region of Burgundy a bishop who was called Felix , who preached the faith to the people of East Anglia ; called here by King Sigeberht ; he received a bishopric in Dommoc , in which he remained for seventeen years . " 
 Bede describes how the exertions of King Sigeberht of East Anglia " were nobly promoted by Bishop Felix , who , coming to Honorius , the archbishop , from the parts of Burgundy , where he had been born and , ordained , and having told him what he desired , was sent by him to preach the Word of life to the aforesaid nation of the Angles " . Later sources tend to differ from the version of events described by Bede and the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . The Liber Eliensis , an English chronicle and history written at Ely Abbey in the 12th century , states that Felix came with Sigeberht from Francia and was then made Bishop of East Anglia . According to another version of the story , Felix travelled from Gaul and reached the hamlet of Babingley , via the River Babingley . He then made his way to Canterbury . He was ordained as a bishop in about 630 or 631 by the Archbishop of Canterbury , Honorius . 
 Felix 's arrival in East Anglia seems to have coincided with the start of a new period of order established by Sigeberht , that had followed the assassination of Eorpwald and the three years of apostasy that followed Eorpwald 's murder . Sigeberht had become a devout Christian before returning from exile in Francia to become king . His accession may have been decisive in bringing Felix to East Anglia . Peter Hunter challenges the assertion by mediaeval sources that spoke of Felix and Sigeberht travelling together from Francia to England , as in his view Bede 's Ecclesiastical History of the English People implied that Felix went to East Anglia because of Honorius at Canterbury . 
 = = Bishop of the East Angles = = 
 Soon after his arrival at Sigeberht 's court , Felix established a church at Dommoc , his episcopal see , which is widely taken to mean Dunwich , on the Suffolk coast . Dunwich has since been almost totally destroyed by the effects of coastal erosion . Other historians have suggested as an alternative site for Felix 's see the coastal Walton , Suffolk near Felixstowe , where there was once a Roman fort . A church and priory were dedicated to him there by Roger Bigod in 1105 . 
 Bede related that Felix started a school , " where boys could be taught letters " , to provide Sigeberht with teachers . There is no evidence that Felix 's school was at Soham , as is maintained by later sources . Bede is unclear as to the origin of the teachers at the school that was established , who may have been from Kent itself or similar to those who were to be found in Kent . The Liber Eliensis mentioned that he also founded the abbey at Soham , in Cambridgeshire and a church at <unk> in Norfolk : " Indeed , one reads in an English source that St Felix was the original founder of the old monastery of <unk> and of the church at <unk> " . According to Margaret <unk> , the large size of the East Anglian diocese would have made the foundation of a second religious establishment at Soham " appear very probable " . 
 During his years as bishop , the East Anglian Church was made still stronger when Fursey arrived from Ireland and founded a monastery , at Cnobheresburg , probably located at Burgh Castle , in Norfolk . 
 = = Death and veneration = = 
 Felix died in 647 or 648 , after he had been bishop for seventeen years . After his death , which probably occurred during the reign of Anna of East Anglia , Thomas , a <unk> , became the second Bishop of the East Angles . Felix was buried at Dommoc , but his relics were at a later date removed to Soham , according to the twelfth century English historian William of Malmesbury . His shrine was desecrated by the Vikings when the church was destroyed . Some time later , " the body of the saint was looked for and found , and buried at Ramsey Abbey " . Ramsey was noted for its enthusiasm for collecting saints ' relics , and in an apparent attempt to out @-@ compete their rivals from the abbey at Ely , the Ramsey monks escaped by rowing their boats through thick Fenland fog , carrying with them the bishop 's precious remains . 
 Felix 's feast day is celebrated on 8 March . There are six churches dedicated to the saint , located in North Yorkshire and East Anglia . According to the mediaeval customary of Bury St Edmunds , known as the Liber Albus , Felix is said to have visited Babingley , in the north west of Norfolk , and ' <unk> ... ... the <unk> kirke ' – ' built the holy church ' . 
 The village of <unk> ( in Yorkshire ) and the town of Felixstowe may both have been named after the saint , though an alternative meaning for Felixstowe , " the stow of <unk> " , has been suggested .

 The first white settler , Nicholas Depuy , arrived from New Amsterdam in 1727 . His home was used as a fort during the French and Indian War ( 1754 – 1763 ) . In 1904 , Worthington Hall , later known as the Shawnee Playhouse , was built in the village . Shawnee is also the home of the Shawnee Inn and Golf Resort , originally built as the <unk> Inn with a course designed by A. W. Tillinghast in the early 20th century .

 Shawnee tribe refugees from Ohio settled in the area in 1692 . The first white settler was Nicholas Depuy , from New Amsterdam , New York , who arrived in 1727 and bought 3 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 ha ) of land from the local <unk> tribe of Lenape Indians . During the French and Indian War ( 1754 – 1763 ) his home was used as a fort , and became known as Fort Depuy . The village was given its name by a surveyor sent by William Penn , who mistakenly thought the local Indians were Shawnee . 
 In 1736 , a ferry began to operate , traveling from Shawnee between Shawnee Island and Depuy Island , then across the Delaware River to New Jersey . By 1740 Aaron Depuy was operating a store , and in 1753 he built a stone and log church used by ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church . The cornerstone of this church remains , now part of the Shawnee Presbyterian Church . The farming community grew steadily , using the river to transport produce . A post office was built in 1843 , and a brick church was erected in 1853 on the foundation of the old stone and log church . Some of the original beams still remain , as well as the original sounding board . Judge J. <unk> LeBar moved to Shawnee from <unk> Township , New Jersey in about 1850 , and by the end of the decade he 'd opened a general store in the village . In 1888 the River School was built near Shawnee , made of stone and sporting a roof @-@ framing system with wood and iron truss members . 
 Charles Campbell Worthington was a successful businessman , owner of the Worthington Pump and Machinery Corporation . In the late 1890s Worthington began to spend an increasing amount of time at his country home in Shawnee on Delaware , and in 1900 he retired to live in Shawnee . In 1904 he built Worthington Hall , later known as the Shawnee Playhouse . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 , but the building was de @-@ listed in 1986 after being demolished following a fire caused by arson on June 24 , 1985 . The playhouse was rebuilt with help from the people of Shawnee on Delaware , the Seabees , the Hughes Foundation , the National Endowment for the Arts , The National Trust , a Community Development Block Grant , and others . Charles Campbell Worthington also established the Worthington Society , a society dedicated to ornithology which was directed by Charles W. Miller . The society caught over 300 pigeons on the grounds in less than three months .

 Lime , produced by burning limestone , was used to neutralize acidity and improve the fertility of the soil in the Shawnee area . One of the local farmers built a lime kiln into a slope on his property ; the kiln on John Turn Farm is well @-@ preserved and is listed as a historic place . Hiram , son of Judge J. <unk> LeBar , farmed about three hundreds across on Shawnee Island , which included land of the present day golf course . A barn , 110 feet ( 34 m ) long by 60 feet ( 18 m ) was built which could hold some hundred tons of grain when full , with room to store forty acres of wheat and twenty acres of oats . A stone mill was also built in the vicinity , the first flour mill in Smithfield Township , which would be ground and loaded onto boats and sold in Philadelphia . 
 Worthington built the <unk> Inn , an exclusive resort , with an eighteen @-@ hole golf course designed by A. W. Tillinghast . This later became the Shawnee Country Club . The course was completed around 1910 . In 1913 , John McDermott won the Shawnee Open golf tournament at Shawnee @-@ on @-@ Delaware , ahead of top Englishmen Harry <unk> and Ted Ray . After trying unsuccessfully to keep the fairways in shape by grazing sheep on them , Worthington designed the gang mower with three moving wheels . He launched the Shawnee Mower Factory to manufacture it . 
 With the depression the inn 's business suffered , and the building was not properly maintained . Worthington 's family sold the inn in 1943 to Fred Waring , a famous choral master . Waring made the inn his base , and during the 1950s his radio programs featuring Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians were broadcast from the Worthington Hall . During the 1940s and early 1950s , Waring and His Pennsylvanians produced a string of hits , selling millions of records . A few of his many choral hits include " Sleep , " " Battle Hymn of the Republic , " " Smoke Gets in Your Eyes , " " Button Up Your Overcoat , " " White Christmas , " " Give Me Your Tired , Your Poor " and " Dancing in the Dark . " Waring and some of his friends founded Words and Music Inc. in 1939 . In 1947 he moved the company to Shawnee and renamed it the Shawnee Press . The company became a major publisher of sacred and secular music . In 2009 it was acquired by the Hal Leonard Corporation . 
 Many of Waring 's celebrity friends visited the inn and played golf . Among them were Bob Hope , Art Carney , George Goebel , Arnold Palmer , Lucille Ball , Ed Sullivan , Eddie Fisher , Perry Como , President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Jackie Gleason . The golf architect Bill Diddle expanded the course to 27 holes . Waring sold the inn in 1974 to Philadelphia real estate developer Karl Hope who expanded the operation and made it less exclusive , introducing <unk> and adding skiing and water activities .

 = Ontario Highway 80 = 
 King 's Highway 80 , commonly referred to as Highway 80 , was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . It travelled in an east – west direction south of Sarnia from Courtright to Strathburn . Beginning at the St. Clair Parkway near the shores of the St. Clair River , the route travelled 69 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 43 @.@ 2 mi ) , intersecting Highway 40 , Highway 21 and Highway 79 before ending at Highway 2 . In addition to the towns at either terminus , Highway 80 serviced the communities of Brigden , Glencoe and Alvinston . The entire route was and remains two lanes wide . 
 Highway 80 was first designated in 1937 , travelling east from Highway 79 in Alvinston to Highway 2 in Strathburn . Most of the original winding highway was bypassed in 1962 , and the route was extended west in 1963 to what was then Highway 40 , now the St. Clair Parkway . It remained this way for over 30 years before being decommissioned as a provincial highway entirely in the mass downloading of highways in 1997 . Today the route is known as County Road 80 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 80 was a two @-@ laned rural connector highway in Lambton and Middlesex Counties . The generally straight route followed Courtright Line and Dundonald Road , both concession roads created through statute labour during the 1800s . 
 Beginning near the shore of the St. Clair River , at the St. Clair Parkway , the former highway travels east , encountering Highway 40 approximately 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) inshore . Between there and the community of Kimball , the route veers several times to avoid natural obstacles . It bisects the Brigden Crown Game Preserve , a Carolinian bird sanctuary , before entering the village of Brigden at the eastern boundary of the preserve . Between Brigden and former Highway 21 at Oil City , the route crosses a flat agricultural area and encounters the historic Sarnia Plank Road . 
 East of Oil City , Highway 80 continues through a large swath of farmland , passing south of the communities of Glen Rae , Weidman and Inwood . Prior to crossing the Sydenham River and entering Middlesex County , the route encounters former Highway 79 south of the town of Alvinston . Within Middlesex County , the highway curves southeast onto Dundonald Road . It crosses both the CN and CP railways in the vicinity of Glencoe , which the route bisects . The final 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) of the highway travels through farmland before entering the community of Strathburn , where the route ends at former Highway 2 ( Longwoods Road ) . 
 = = History = = 
 Highway 80 was first established as a provincial highway on August 11 , 1937 , when the Department of Highways ( DHO ) , predecessor to the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ( MTO ) , assumed the road between Alvinston and Strathburn , connecting Highway 2 and Highway 79 . In it original incarnation , Highway 80 met Highway 79 in Alvinston at the intersection of Nauvoo Road and Centre Street . From there it travelled east to River Street , where it jogged north to Sydenham Street . From there , the route crossed the Sydenham River and followed the Gardner Trail , Lobelia Street , Conservation Road and Calvert Drive to arrive at the more modern routing of the highway . The original length of Highway 80 was 13 @.@ 9 mi ( 22 @.@ 4 km ) . 
 However , this winding route proved to be too dangerous and difficult for the explosion of vehicle traffic that occurred after World War II . Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad , which was taken over by the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central . However , by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so much that service was stopped . The tracks were lifted two years later . In response , the DHO sought to improve the connection between Alvinston and Glencoe . Courtright Line , which ended at Cameron Road and did not cross the Sydenham River , was chosen as an ideal route to extend east . This new route opened in May 1962 . 
 In 1963 , Highway 80 was extended west to Highway 40 at Courtright , bringing it to its peak length of 69 @.@ 6 km ( 43 @.@ 2 mi ) . Prior to being renumbered , the DHO reconstructed the road , originally built through statute labour and improved slightly as a township road , and referred to it as Development Road 471 . There are conflicting dates as to when this extension became Highway 80 . The 1963 Annual report indicates both July 1 and August 12 as the assumption date . However , an annual average daily traffic log published in 1970 indicates that the extension was assumed on September 4 . The new extension was immediately paved , as it was a gravel road . The route remained unchanged for the next 34 years , until April 1 , 1997 , when it was transferred , or downloaded , to Lambton County and Middlesex County . The former highway is now known as County Road 80 throughout its length .

 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth is an adventure module for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role @-@ playing game . It was written by Gary Gygax and published by TSR in 1982 for the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ( AD & D ) rules . The 64 @-@ page adventure bears the code " S4 " ( " S " for " special " ) and is set in the Greyhawk campaign setting . It is divided into two parts , a 32 @-@ page adventure , and a 32 @-@ page booklet of monsters and magic items . The plot involves the player characters investigating rumors of lost treasure . After traversing a wilderness and two levels of dungeons , the players face Drelzna , the vampiric daughter of long @-@ deceased archmage Iggwilv . 
 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth was published in 1982 and is a revised and expanded version of The Lost Caverns of <unk> , a tournament adventure that Gygax wrote for 1976 <unk> V gaming convention . Gygax expanded the tournament adventure by adding a wilderness area , with part of it based on earlier work by Rob Kuntz . Work on the adventure delayed the completion of The Temple of Elemental Evil , another Gygax adventure . The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth was included in the 1987 supermodule Realms of Horror , and updated for v3.5 in an online edition in 2007 . It was well received by critics , ranked the 22nd greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004 . A White Dwarf reviewer gave the adventure 9 / 10 , noting its difficulty and rewards of powerful magic . It is part of a series along with S1 : Tomb of Horrors , S2 : White Plume Mountain , S3 : Expedition to the Barrier Peaks . It also has a loosely connected sequel : The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The introduction , with instructions that the Dungeon Master read it aloud to the players , outlines that there is a treasure in the <unk> Mountains south of the Greyhawk realm of <unk> . The player characters must investigate rumors of a lost treasure that scores of adventurers have perished attempting to find . The treasure is a remnant of the wealth amassed by the archmage Iggwilv , former ruler of <unk> , prior to her presumed death at the hands of the demon Graz 'zt , whom she had " imprisoned and forced into servitude . " The players must first traverse a wilderness area with 20 numbered encounters before arriving at the caverns . The encounters have names such as " Border Patrol " ( encounter 1 ) and " Hill Giants " ( encounter 10 ) . After the wilderness are two lettered encounters : the " Gnome Vale " , which includes a map for their lair , and " The <unk> Dells " , where humans and orcs are capturing <unk> to sell . 
 Next , the player characters reach the caverns . They consist of the " Lesser Caverns " with 22 encounters , and the " Greater Caverns " with 20 encounters , each with its own map . The lesser caverns include encounters such as " Stinking Cave " ( encounter 5 ) which contains four trolls and " Underground Lake " ( encounter 14 ) . The greater caverns include encounters such as " Uneven @-@ <unk> Cavern " ( encounter 5 ) where the player characters face an umber hulk and " Canyon of Centaurs " ( encounter 9 ) . The 20th and final encounter is titled " The Inner Sphere " . Here , a " woman sleeps on an alabaster slab . " She is " armored from toe to neck in gold chased plate mail . " The woman is actually Drelzna , a fighter / vampire and the daughter of Iggwilv . After defeating Drelzna , the players are rewarded with treasure , and the adventure ends . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth is a revised and expanded version of The Lost Caverns of <unk> , a tournament adventure that Gygax wrote for <unk> V , a gaming convention sponsored by the Metro Detroit Gamers ( MDG ) in 1976 . It is based in part on one of Rob Kuntz 's dungeon levels , as Kuntz helped Gygax revise the tournament version . This original version consisted of eight loose sheets , an outer folder , and a zip @-@ locked bag ; only several hundred copies were printed . In the May 1980 issue of Dragon , Gygax said " Rob Kuntz has the reworked Lost Caverns module which must be finalized " and that " We want to get it into print as soon as possible . " Lawrence Schick later suggested that " there 's evidence that Gary considered Tsojcanth part of a longer Greyhawk campaign , placing the adventure between T1 – T4 The Temple of Elemental Evil and <unk> The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun . ( By this reckoning , The Village of <unk> , The Temple of Elemental Evil , and Tsojcanth are thus the " lost " <unk> through <unk> modules . ) So , Tsojcanth was published in the S series because it got completed out of order , but was too good to delay . " 
 In 1980 , Gygax began rewriting the adventure for first edition AD & D , expanding it to include outdoor encounters . The redevelopment of The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth was one of the major delays in the completion of The Temple of Elemental Evil . This version of the module was revised and expanded , and included two 32 @-@ page books , and an outer folder . In the November 1981 issue of Dragon , Gygax said that TSR needed a competition level module and that " the effort needed to finish the second hundred or so pages of Elemental Evil went into preparation of The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth . The scenario was initially done for a convention tournament , but the new product has an extensive outdoor adventure and a completely new series of encounters " . While in the middle of working on Temple of Elemental Evil , Gygax added a complete outdoor story arc to the original tournament story arc that leads to the caverns . The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth includes new spells , and many new monsters which were later featured in Monster Manual II . 
 The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun ( 1982 ) starts off from an event in The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth and features monsters from the Fiend Folio . In 1987 , The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth was revised and included in TSR 's " supermodule " Realms of Horror . In 2007 , it was updated to v3.5 and included as one of three parts in Iggwilv 's Legacy : The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth , an adventure available online from Wizards of the Coast . 
 Both versions of the module included monsters that were later included other Dungeons & Dragons products . The monsters introduced in the original un @-@ published version were updated for AD & D rules and included in the first edition Monster Manual . Monsters appearing in the published version included the demon princes Baphomet , <unk> @-@ Urb <unk> , Graz 'zt , and <unk> , who later appeared in the original Monster Manual II . The published module 's cover features an illustration of a <unk> by Erol Otus . 
 All four modules of the S @-@ series were included as part of the Dungeons of Dread hardcover collection , released on March 19 , 2013 . Lawrence Schick writes in the foreword that " S4 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth marked the end of the S series — and rightly so , because despite being based on a gilded @-@ hole dungeon originally designed for a tournament in 1976 , its updated version really belonged more to the ' 80s campaign @-@ setting school of design than to the wild @-@ and @-@ woolly ' 70s . S1 through S3 were standalone modules that could be easily dropped into any DM 's campaign , but Tsojcanth is firmly based in Gary 's World of Greyhawk . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth was favorably received by critics . Lawrence Schick , in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds , described the adventure as " A monster @-@ filled labyrinth in the classic mode : kill ' em , rob ' em , and leave . " It was ranked the 22nd @-@ greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004 , on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game . Dungeon 's editors felt that the " pedestrian character of the caverns echoes the adventure 's primordial nature " , while its complicated wilderness setting and large second booklet set it apart from other adventures of the time . The booklet introduced 30 new creatures , including the <unk> and the demon lords Baphomet and Graz 'zt . The reviewers felt that the adventure 's defining moment was when the players find Iggwilv 's " fabled treasure " : her vampire daughter Drelzna . 
 Jim Bambra reviewed the adventure for White Dwarf . He gave it 9 / 10 overall , with 9 / 10 for presentation , rules , playability , enjoyment , skill , and complexity . Bambra noted that the module ended a long time off for Gary Gygax , and was " very tough " and that good play was stressed in the introduction . Sub par play quickly ended the story , but the rewards of powerful magic and the satisfaction of completing a difficult task made it worthwhile . He also noted that the adventure came with a 32 @-@ page booklet with 30 new monsters and a small amount of new magic . Not all the new creatures are featured in the plot , but they can be used by the DM in other adventures . Also , magical diagrams are given an in @-@ depth treatment , including their creation and effectiveness . 
 James Jacobs credits Gary Gygax 's work on The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth for inspiration on Jacobs 's work on the " <unk> of Iggwilv " column in Dragon magazine . 
 = Flocke = 
 Flocke ( German pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) is a female polar bear who was born in captivity at the Nuremberg Zoo in Nuremberg , Germany on 11 December 2007 . A few weeks after her birth , she was removed from her mother 's care after concerns were raised for her safety . Although the zoo had established a strict non @-@ interference policy with its animals , officials chose to raise the cub by hand . This decision came at a time when the zoo was receiving negative attention from the media after another female polar bear reportedly ate her newly born cubs . 
 Like Knut , a captive @-@ born and <unk> polar bear at the Berlin Zoo , Flocke ( " flake " in German ) quickly became a media sensation . After she made her debut to the public on 8 April 2008 , her name was trademarked by the zoo and her image appeared on toys and in advertisements throughout the city . The zoo announced in May 2008 that United Nations Environment Program chief Achim Steiner would be Flocke 's official patron with the hope of using the bear as an ambassador to encourage awareness of climate change . In late 2008 , a Russian @-@ born male polar bear named Rasputin was introduced to Flocke 's enclosure in the hopes that she would gain valuable socializing skills with a member of her own species . In April 2010 , both bears were relocated to Marineland in southern France . 
 = = Infancy and controversy = = 
 Flocke was born at the Nuremberg Zoo on 11 December 2007 to Vera ( born 2002 in Moscow ) and Felix ( born 2001 in Vienna ) . Felix also mated with Vera 's sister Vilma , who gave birth some weeks earlier in November to what officials thought were two cubs . <unk> , enforcing a strict non @-@ interference policy , were not able to determine exactly how many cubs were born . The zoo reportedly did not wish to create a media circus similar to the one that surrounded Knut , an orphaned polar bear at the Berlin Zoo who became an international celebrity the previous year . Days after the zoo reaffirmed its non @-@ interference policy , mass circulation daily Bild ran a story with a headline reading " Why Won 't Anyone Save the Cute Baby <unk> in Nuremberg Zoo ? " 
 At the beginning of January , zoo keepers noticed that Vilma appeared nervous ; she was seen <unk> scratching at her <unk> , and there was no further sign of her cubs . It is believed that she devoured them . When asked for a reason , Nuremberg zoo director Dag Encke stated that they could have been ill , a circumstance under which polar bears in the wild often eat their young . The zoo quickly faced harsh criticism throughout Germany and from the worldwide media for appearing to allow the cubs ' death . The director of the German Animal Protection Society said the zoo had acted irresponsibly and that " it was the ethical responsibility of the management to give the polar bear cubs a chance of life . Using the argument ' That 's Nature ' as an excuse for intervening far too late is cynical and inappropriate . " Angry visitors gathered in front of the polar bear enclosure and shouted " <unk> " ( literally , " raven mother , " meaning " evil mother " ) every time Vilma appeared . 
 Meanwhile , Vera was seen emerging from her den for the first time ; her single cub , helpless at only four weeks old , appeared to be in good health . A couple of days after the media backlash that followed Vilma 's missing cubs , Vera began displaying strange behavior such as carrying her then @-@ unnamed cub around the enclosure and repeatedly dropping it on the hard rock floor . Concerned for the cub 's safety , the Nuremberg Zoo made a controversial decision to remove her from her mother 's care and raise her by hand . 
 = = Fame = = 
 Less than a week after Vera 's cub was removed from the polar bear enclosure , the zoo dedicated a website to the cub . It provided frequent updates on her health and development , as well as exclusive photographs and videos . The website also showcased a competition in which fans could vote for the cub 's name . The official name was announced on 18 January 2008 by Ulrich Maly , mayor of Nuremberg , and broadcast live on television . Despite the overwhelming number of e @-@ mailed suggestions from across the world ( including " Stella " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " and " Yuki Chan " ) , the zoo officially named her Flocke , German for " flake " , as in " snowflake " . " Flocke " , used widely by the media previous to her official naming , was the nickname originally given to her by zookeepers because of her white fur . 
 Flocke 's growth was carefully reported by the media during her first few months . Four zookeepers took turns bottle @-@ feeding the cub with 140 milliliters of artificial milk every four hours and news of her eyes opening for the first time made headlines a few days before she was officially named . At five weeks old , she was referred to by the publication Bild as " Mrs. Knut " , suggesting that the two German @-@ born polar bears might become mates when they mature . As she grew , Flocke 's diet was enriched with dog food , and boiled bones were supplied for her to chew on when she was three months old . She was soon taken to the zoo 's beginners ' pool to practice her swimming skills . The zoo had previously stated that they were seeking another orphaned polar or brown bear cub to raise alongside Flocke in order to improve her development . 
 On 8 April 2008 , Flocke made her first public appearance in the polar bear enclosure that had once been home to Vilma ; the adult polar bear had been relocated to another zoo . The four @-@ month @-@ old cub was greeted by more than 160 journalists and a half @-@ dozen international camera crews on the first day . During the first week , Flocke was displayed for short intervals with breaks at midday . Expecting a peak of 20 @,@ 000 visitors , the zoo built a viewing platform , capable of holding 500 people at a time , in front of the enclosure , but attendance by zoo patrons was initially lower than expected . The zoo uses a video transmission and recording system from Bosch Security Systems to transmit TV @-@ quality live images of the cub to a pair of 46 @-@ inch ( 1 @,@ 200 mm ) large @-@ format screens . This system , which includes one screen outside the enclosure , was implemented to help the zoo meet the demands of visitors wanting to catch a glimpse of Flocke . 
 Shortly after her debut , however , Flocke became the focus of controversy when prominent animal conservationist Jürgen <unk> , chairman of the Whale and Dolphin Protection Forum , hired a lawyer to stop Nuremberg Zoo 's exploitation of the polar bear cub . Claiming that Flocke 's public exposure would have damaging effects and that the zoo was only concerned about earning money , <unk> recruited high @-@ profile lawyer Rolf Bossi to challenge them in court . 
 = = Merchandising and branding = = 
 Soon after Flocke was rescued in January , the city secured branding rights to her name . An official logo was subsequently released by the zoo . Flocke became part of a major publicity campaign in Nuremberg when she was depicted along with the phrase " Knut war <unk> " ( Knut is yesterday 's bear ) on posters for the city 's metropolitan region . These posters were displayed at numerous bus and train stops all over the city . 
 Dubbed " Flocke fever " by the press ( similar to the " <unk> " from the previous year ) , the cub 's popularity soared in early 2008 . Her image has been used for games , diaries , soft toys , DVDs , postcards and other items . The first product released , a Flocke @-@ based board game that was released in February , was made by the <unk> @-@ based firm <unk> @-@ Spiele , a unit of Georg <unk> GmbH & Co . KG . The well @-@ known toy company Steiff began selling a variety of Flocke stuffed animals the following May . The income from the merchandise is currently going towards the zoo and to species survival programs . 
 = = Later publicity = = 
 In April 2008 , the zoo decreased human interaction with the cub , hoping that one day she could coexist with members of her species and not be dependent on humans . Becoming more independent from her keepers , Flocke was reported often playing happily on her own . She was given a plastic " dummy " , similar to a child 's teething ring , tied to the bars on the inside of her stable door to suckle on while resting . This suckling caused the cub 's nose to appear bent ; her muzzle remained in this shape for some time before returning to normal . 
 At the age of six months , it was reported that Flocke , whose diet at the time consisted mostly of a kilogram of beef , assorted vegetables and a liter of puppy milk a day , was at the correct weight for her development at 45 kilograms ( 99 lb ) . The zoo 's vet , Bernhard <unk> , also remarked upon the bear 's sweet tooth , stating that " Flocke is very enthusiastic about grapes , melon , kiwi fruit and pears " , with a particular fondness for bananas . 
 United Nations Environment Program chief Achim Steiner became Flocke 's official patron in May 2008 . By assuming this role , Steiner acknowledged Nuremberg Zoo 's efforts towards local climate protection , stating " I am happy to have been asked to become ' godfather ' to Nuremberg 's polar bear cub Flocke . I sincerely hope that during her lifetime we will be able to implement a global green economy . " 
 In June 2008 , a new poster campaign featuring Flocke was announced ; its goal was strengthening public awareness of individuals ' ability to protect Earth 's climate . Sponsored by the Nuremberg Zoo in conjunction with the Nuremberg Metropolitan Region , the poster showed Flocke and the phrase " <unk> <unk> vor Ort " ( " Climate Protection Begins At Home " ) . The zoo also published a pocket @-@ sized brochure featuring Flocke . Entitled " Little Guide to Climate Protection " , it taught visitors how to decrease their carbon dioxide emissions . The Nuremberg Zoo announced in September that it had reached its one millionth visitor for 2008 — two months earlier than last year . Although ticket sales for the year increased due to Flocke 's popularity , the numbers did not match high expectations . The same month it was announced that the cub , now weighing 60 kilograms ( 130 lb ) , would no longer have lunchtime breaks in her stable , and would remain in the enclosure throughout the day . 
 = = Rasputin and move to France = = 
 In late November 2008 , Flocke 's mother Vera gave birth to two cubs , who were fathered by Flocke 's father , Felix . Although Vera was able to care for the new cubs without assistance from zoo keepers , Director Dag Encke initially stated that the cubs had a 50 percent chance of survival . Three weeks after their birth was reported , both cubs died of natural causes within one week of each other . Encke expressed regret after the second cub 's death , stating that " Vera nursed regularly and the young animal always slept well afterwards , so it seemed certain that it received enough milk . The reason that the young animal wasted away so quickly is not known . " 
 A male polar bear cub named Rasputin was relocated from Moscow to the Nuremberg Zoo in December 2008 for what was thought to be an extended stay before his permanent move to the Zoo Aquarium de Madrid . Originally meant to remain in Germany for only a year , the male bear — called " <unk> " by fans — shared Flocke 's enclosure . The zoo hoped that Rasputin , who unlike Flocke was raised by his mother , would teach their celebrity bear how to interact with those of her own species . According to a statement given by the city , the bears " get along famously " . 
 On 21 October 2009 , the city of Nuremberg announced that Flocke and Rasputin would move together to a newly constructed enclosure at Marineland , located in Antibes , France , at the beginning of 2010 . Due to the close relationship between the two adolescent bears , officials from the European Conservation Breeding Program ( <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> , or " EEP " ) decided that the two bears should remain together despite earlier plans for Rasputin to relocate to Madrid alone . The enclosure they are vacating in Nuremberg will be utilized by Flocke 's parents , Vera and Felix , in the hopes that they will produce more cubs . Despite last minute efforts by the animal right 's group PETA to halt the move based on concerns for Flocke and Rasputin 's well @-@ being , the two bears arrived safely in France on 22 April 2010 . On 26 November 2014 , Flocke gave birth to her own cub named Hope , fathered by Rasputin . 
 = Australian cricket team in England in 1948 = 
 The Australian cricket team in England in 1948 was captained by Don Bradman , who was making his fourth and final tour of England . The team is famous for being the first Test match side to play an entire tour of England without losing a match . This feat earned them the nickname of The Invincibles , and they are regarded as one of the greatest cricket teams of all time . According to the Australian federal government the team " is one of Australia 's most cherished sporting legends " . 
 Including five Test matches , Australia played a total of 31 first @-@ class fixtures , plus three other games , two of the non @-@ first @-@ class matches being played in Scotland . They had a busy schedule , with 112 days of play scheduled in 144 days , meaning that they often played every day of the week except Sunday . Their record in the first @-@ class games was 23 won and 8 drawn ; in all matches , they won 25 and drew 9 ; many of the victories were by large margins . They won the Test series 4 – 0 with one draw . 
 The strength of the Australian team was based around its formidable batting line @-@ up , which included Bradman , Arthur Morris , vice @-@ captain Lindsay Hassett , Neil Harvey and Sid Barnes , and the hostile fast bowling of Ray Lindwall , Keith Miller and Bill Johnston . 
 Due to the popularity of Bradman , generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time , and the fact that he had announced that it was his farewell international tour , the Australians were greeted with much fanfare across the country , and many records for match attendances were broken . The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times , in the Second , Third and Fourth Tests , and stands to this day . 
 = = Touring party = = 
 = = Significance = = 
 The 1948 Australian team has great significance in cricket history as it is the only side to tour England unbeaten , earning the sobriquet The Invincibles . The tour was captain Donald Bradman 's last Test series , and the immediate postwar team was the most successful that Bradman appeared in . It has been claimed that English cricket suffered more heavily from the effects of World War II than the Australians . Even so , various commentators have rated the 1948 Australians as one of the best cricket teams ever , and it is often compared to other great outfits such as the 1902 Australian touring team , Warwick Armstrong 's Australian side of just after World War I , the West Indies team of the 1980s and the Australian team of the 1990s and 2000s . This was not a view shared by Jack Fingleton , Bradman 's batting rival from the 1930s , who wrote ' the 1948 Australian side to England , side that some critics , ignoring the apparent lack of strength in English cricket that season , dubbed the " best Australian team ever " – which was just moonshine . Yorkshire almost beat the Australians of 1948 ' , but his view is very much in the minority . 
 The high regard with which The Invincibles are held in the annals of Australian and world cricket is reflected in the various honours accorded to the players . Bradman , Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 . Hassett , Morris and Harvey were later inducted , so that 20 % of the inductees are from the 1948 team . Of these six , all except Hassett were selected in Australia 's Team of the Century , with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy . Bradman , Lindwall , Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council 's Hall of Fame . In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared by a computer and the 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians . Graveney strongly disagreed with the result , writing ' there has not been a better team in my lifetime than Don Bradman 's Australian tourists of 1948 ' . The computer regarded Sam Loxton as a member of the team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey , if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Since the resumption of cricket following World War II , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 – 47 , they won the five @-@ Test series against England 3 – 0 , and followed this with a 4 – 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead @-@ up to the tour of England , and their captain Donald Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five @-@ month tour without defeat . 
 The committee that selected the touring party was Bradman , Jack Ryder and Chappie Dwyer . They held their final meeting on Wednesday 11 February and announced the team that day . The team was chosen with a dual emphasis on strong batting and fast bowling . This was in large part because England had agreed to make a new ball available after 55 six @-@ ball overs in the Tests ; a new ball was generally taken after every 200 runs , which usually takes more than 55 overs to accumulate , the rule change meant that a new ball was more frequently available . A new ball is more helpful to fast bowling , so this move favoured the team with the better pace attack , in this case Australia . 
 Australia had injury concerns to key players ahead of the tour . Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium @-@ pacer Toshack , and he only made the trip after a 3 – 2 vote by a medical panel , despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit . Leading paceman Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon . In addition , his foot drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action . The injury was worked on ahead of the tour , while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action . The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that his foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no @-@ balled , and to operate below full speed until the umpires were satisfied . Bradman 's counsel was effective , as Lindwall did not have a no @-@ ball problem during the tour . 
 Bill Jeanes , who was secretary of the Australian Board of Control and had managed the previous Australian tour of England in 1938 , was offered the job of managing the 1948 team , but turned it down . Jeanes had become increasingly unpopular among the players because of an approach that cricket historian Gideon Haigh has called " increasingly officious and <unk> " . He was replaced by Keith Johnson , the New South Wales delegate to the Australian Board of Control . Johnson had previously managed the Australian Services team — which included Keith Miller and Lindsay Hassett — in the Victory Tests that took place in 1945 at the conclusion of the Second World War in Europe .

 Before they sailed for England , Australia played three warm @-@ up matches . The first two were two @-@ day games against Tasmania in Hobart and at the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground , Launceston ; the third was a three @-@ day match against Western Australia in Perth . In Hobart , Australia scored 538 / 5 declared with centuries by Barnes , Hassett and Harvey in reply to 122 . Using a mixture of pace and spin , they reduced Tasmania to 186 / 7 when time ran out . In Launceston , Australia won by an innings and 49 runs . Toshack took 5 / 24 as Tasmania fell for 123 . Australia then scored 288 before five bowlers shared the wickets as Tasmania fell for just 116 , Barnes taking 3 / 1 . Four days later , on Saturday 13 March , the Australians were at the WACA Ground where they found a tougher test from Western Australia . Western Australia scored 348 as Wally Langdon made 112 , while five bowlers took two wickets each . Australia replied with 442 / 7 declared , including 115 apiece by Morris and Bradman . Western Australia only had time to reach 62 / 3 and the game was drawn . The match attracted a total crowd of 30 @,@ 500 .

 The team set sail on board RMS Strathaird from Fremantle on Friday 19 March . En route to England , the Australians berthed in Colombo where they played a one @-@ day single @-@ innings match — not limited overs — against the Ceylon national team at the Colombo Cricket Club Ground . The local newspaper The Islander ran a headline of " Bradman Will Definitely Play " and this guaranteed a crowd of more than 20 @,@ 000 . Australia batted first and became suspicious about the pitch as the morning went on . At lunch , Ian Johnson demanded that the pitch be measured and it was found to be only 20 yards ( 18 m ) long . After that , the bowlers delivered from two yards behind the crease . Australia made 184 / 8 declared ( Barnes 49 , Miller 46 ) before a monsoon ended the match with Ceylon at 46 / 2 in reply . 
 The party docked at Tilbury on Friday 16 April to a resounding welcome . Bradman announced the delivery of 17 @,@ 000 food parcels as a gift to the British people from the State of Victoria . Great Britain was still in the throes of rationing and post @-@ war austerity . 
 = = Popularity = = 
 Despite Australia 's ruthless on @-@ field dominance and a succession of one @-@ sided victories , the touring team drew unprecedented levels of spectator and media interest . Bradman 's dominant cricketing stature was a key factor in his team 's popularity with the public , especially as it was known that it would be his last international campaign . A leading cricket writer of the time , R. C. Robertson @-@ Glasgow , said " we want him to do well . We feel we have a share in him . He is more than Australian . He is a world batsman . " The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that " cities , towns and hotels are <unk> , carpets set down , and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome . He is the Prince of Cricketers . " Writing later , Haigh opined that " perhaps no touring cricketer ... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer " . Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day , and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live , causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin . Of Bradman 's retirement , Robertson @-@ Glasgow said in the 1949 Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack : " ... a miracle has been removed from among us ... So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal . " 
 As a team , the Australians were greeted by record crowds and gate receipts across the country , even when wet weather curtailed the matches . The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times , in the Second Test at Lord 's , the Third Test at Old Trafford , and the Fourth Test at Headingley . The 158 @,@ 000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil . 
 Off the field , the Australians were inundated with requests for social functions , including appointments with government officials and members of the royal family , and they had to juggle a plethora of off @-@ field engagements , with 112 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days . Three @-@ day matches were often held consecutively with only the traditional Sunday rest day , although their dominance ended several matches prematurely and earned them extra rest days . 
 Team manager Keith Johnson , the only administrator in the touring party , was flooded with phone calls and letters . Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson 's tireless work would cause health problems and that " it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through " . Wisden said " <unk> for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager , Mr Keith Johnson , hard @-@ working and always genial ... Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players , Mr Johnson said there had not been a discordant note in the party throughout the tour . " Bradman said that " no side could have wished for a better manager " . 
 = = Bradman 's role = = 
 Bradman 's position as a selector gave him more power than previous Australian captains , who did not have an explicit vote in team selection . This was further magnified by Bradman being a member of the Board of Control while still an active player , a threefold combination that he alone has occupied in Australian cricket history . According to Haigh , he " was the dominant figure in Australian cricket " , and an " unimpeachable figure " . At the age of 40 , Bradman was by four years the oldest player on the team ; three quarters of his team were 32 or younger , and some viewed him as a father figure . Bradman wrote that this was the most personally fulfilling period of his playing days , as the divisiveness of the 1930s had passed . He wrote : 
 Knowing the personnel , I was confident that here at last was the great opportunity which I had longed for . A team of cricketers whose respect and loyalty were unquestioned , who would regard me in a fatherly sense and listen to my advice , follow my guidance and not question my handling of affairs ... there are no longer any fears that they will query the wisdom of what you do . The result is a sense of freedom to give full reign to your own creative ability and personal judgment . 
 However , some players expressed displeasure at Bradman 's ruthless obsession towards annihilating the opposition . Miller deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball for a duck in a protest against Australia 's world record of 721 runs in one day against Essex . He also deplored Bradman 's hard @-@ nosed attitude in fixtures nominally designated as " festival matches " . Feeling that Bradman was needlessly batting Australia far beyond impregnability , Miller played with reckless aggression , rather than a measured style in line with his captain 's aim of remaining undefeated . Bradman 's letters in later life , published posthumously , revealed his hostility towards Miller . Sid Barnes later criticised Bradman for his reluctance to allow Ron Hamence — one of the reserve batsmen — to partake in meaningful matchplay due to captain 's reluctance to risk Australia 's unbeaten run . 
 = = Roles and strategy = = 
 As matches often started the day after the previous fixture , sometimes amounting to six days of cricket a week — Sunday was always a rest day — Australia employed a rotation policy in order to allow the players to recuperate , except for the Tests and matches against Worcestershire , the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Leveson @-@ Gower 's XI , when they chose their strongest team . As a result , no member of the squad — Bradman included — played in more than 23 of the first @-@ class matches . Thus , the vice @-@ captain Hassett led the Australians in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested , and maintained the unbeaten run in all of them . Wisden opined that " in addition to his playing ability Hassett 's cheerfulness and leadership , which extended to off @-@ the @-@ field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme , combined to make him an ideal vice @-@ captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman 's busy shoulders " . 
 Likewise , the batting was regularly rotated . The three openers Barnes , Morris and Brown took turns sitting out , while the middle @-@ order was changed frequently and the wicket @-@ keeping duties divided between Tallon and Saggers . 
 Australia 's bowling attack was led by Lindwall and Miller , who took the new ball in the Tests . Bradman used the pair in short and fiery bursts with the new ball . English cricket administrators had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs ; at the time , the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored , something that usually took longer than 55 overs . The new regulation played directly into the hands of the Australians , as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack . Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first @-@ choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs . As a result , Australia 's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled the most overs , and the left arm seamer Ernie Toshack also had a heavy workload until a knee injury ended his campaign . 
 The new ball rule also meant that spin bowling was less effective in the Tests , so Australia only used one full @-@ time spinner in the Tests , off spinner Johnson , until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring . Together they took only eight wickets . 
 Things were different in the county matches . As Bradman wanted to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh for the Tests , he generally gave them a lighter workload against the weaker opposition in the county matches , and the three spinners Ring , Johnson and McCool did more of the work , especially as the 55 @-@ over rule did not apply outside the Tests . Ring did the second @-@ most bowling outside the Tests , despite not being in Bradman 's first @-@ choice team . Bradman even used Hamence , a reserve batsman , to open the bowling at times , in order to rest his bowlers , and in the second match against Yorkshire , decided to bat for an extended period instead of going for a win , so that his bowlers could recuperate . 
 = = Ashes Test matches = = 
 The five @-@ Test Ashes series was won convincingly by Australia 4 – 0 . England was captained by Norman Yardley and their batting was strong on paper , the first four in the order generally being Len Hutton , Cyril Washbrook , Bill Edrich and Denis Compton . They were supported by the likes of Joe Hardstaff junior , Tom Dollery , Charlie Barnett , Jack Crapp , John Dewes , Allan Watkins , Yardley and wicket @-@ keeper Godfrey Evans . However , they found the fast bowling trio of Lindwall , Miller and Johnston — supported by the medium pace of Toshack — a real handful , especially with the 55 @-@ over new ball rule . 
 Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers , with high pace and the ability to deliver menacing short @-@ pitched bowling at the upper body of the batsmen . Prior to World War II , pace bowlers were generally much slower and rarely bowled at the body . England were yet to develop similar bowlers , and as a result , Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation . At one stage , the Australian short @-@ pitched barrage prompted the English selectors to drop leading batsman Hutton , something that provoked great controversy . Lindwall and Johnston dominated the home batsmen and took 27 wickets apiece , at averages of 19 @.@ 62 and 23 @.@ 33 respectively , while the injury @-@ prone Miller took 13 at 23 @.@ 15 . For England , the batsman emerging with most credit was Compton , who scored 562 runs at 62 @.@ 44 . Washbrook ( 356 runs at 50 @.@ 85 ) was the only other player to average beyond 45 . 
 In contrast , Australia 's batsmen had relatively little difficulty against the hosts ' attack . England 's bowling was largely reliant on Alec Bedser and against a powerful Australian batting line @-@ up he managed only 18 wickets at 38 @.@ 22 . Alec Coxon , Dick Pollard , Edrich , Barnett and Yardley provided his seam support . Jim Laker , Jack Young , Eric Hollies and Doug Wright were the spinners in action . Bedser was the only English bowler to take more than nine wickets . Morris led the <unk> and century @-@ making with 696 runs at 87 @.@ 00 and three triple @-@ figure scores , supported by Bradman ( 508 at 72 @.@ 57 ) and Barnes ( 329 at 82 @.@ 25 ) . With the first three batsmen in such form , Australia regularly made strong starts to their innings , averaging more than 120 for their first two wickets . 
 The resounding Australian victories gave the England selectors many problems as they sought to find a combination that could challenge the tourists ' superiority . As a result , England used 21 players in all , while Australia only used 15 , one of which was forced by injury . Australia had ten players who competed in four or more Tests , while England only had seven such players . 
 = = = First Test = = = 
 Since the Second World War , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 – 47 , they won the five @-@ Test series against England 3 – 0 , and followed this with a 4 – 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead @-@ up to the tour of England , and Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five @-@ month tour without defeat . Prior to the First Test , Australia had played 12 first @-@ class matches , winning ten and drawing two . Eight of the victories were by an innings , and another was by eight wickets . 
 It was thought that Bradman would play Ring , but he changed his mind on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast . Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket and he amply rewarded his captain by taking the most wickets of any bowler in the match . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . 
 The first innings set the pattern of the series as the England top @-@ order struggled against Australia 's pace attack . Only twenty minutes of play was possible before the lunch break due to inclement weather , but it was enough for Miller to bowl Hutton . During the interval , heavy rain made the ball skid through upon resumption . Washbrook was caught attempting to hook Lindwall . At 15 / 2 , Compton came in , and together with Edrich , they took the score to 46 before left arm paceman Johnston bowled the latter . Two balls later , Johnston removed Hardstaff without scoring , leaving England at 46 / 4 . Two runs later , Compton was bowled by Miller and half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board . Lindwall was forced to leave the field mid @-@ innings due to a groin injury and did not bowl again . Johnston bowled Barnett and when Evans and Yardley were both dismissed with the score on 74 , England only had two wickets left . Laker and Bedser scored more than half of England 's total , adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes . Both fell within two runs , ending England 's innings at 165 . Laker top @-@ scored with 63 . Johnston ended with 5 / 36 , a display characterised with accuracy and variations in pace and swing . Miller took 3 / 38 and a catch . 
 Australia 's openers Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes . Ideal batting conditions greeted the players on the second day . Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris . Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket @-@ keeper Evans with a one @-@ handed diving effort for 62 . Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker . 
 Australia scored slowly , as Yardley employed leg theory to slow the scoring . Brown came in at No. 5 , but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24 . Hassett came in and Australia reached stumps at 293 / 4 , a lead of 128 . Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes , with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes . It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs . On the third morning , Bradman added only eight before falling for 138 when he leg glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg . Johnson and Tallon came and went , failing to pass 21 . The scoring was slow during this passage of play — Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs . Lindwall came out to bat at 365 / 7 and he added 107 runs with Hassett for the eighth wicket . Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting . Both fell in quick succession , but Australia 's last @-@ wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser ended the innings on 509 , leaving the tourists with a 344 @-@ run lead . Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his spinners , with Young ( 1 / 79 ) and Laker ( 4 / 138 ) bowling 60 and 55 overs respectively . Bedser bowled 44 @.@ 2 overs , taking 3 / 113 . 
 At the start of England 's second innings , Washbrook and Edrich fell early , leaving England at 39 / 2 . This brought together England 's leading batsmen , Hutton and Compton , who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day . Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon , delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day . One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm . The batsmen survived , but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd . The English had the better of the late afternoon period , scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes . 
 Hutton resumed on 63 and he and Compton progressed before the light deteriorated and a thunderstorm stopped proceedings . Shortly after the resumption , Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions , ending a 111 @-@ run partnership at 150 / 3 . The innings was then repeatedly interrupted by poor light . Wisden opined that " rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day " . Hardstaff supported Compton in a partnership of 93 before being removed by Toshack , and Barnett followed soon after at 264 / 5 . Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge , aided by a 57 @-@ run partnership with his captain before Johnston dismissed Yardley for 22 . England reached stumps at 345 / 6 , just one run ahead , with Compton on 154 . 
 Compton and Evans continued to resist the Australians on the final morning , which was briefly interrupted twice by rain . After the resumption , Compton was out hit wicket for 184 after attempting to hook Miller . He had batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours . Wisden opined that " No praise could be too high for the manner in which Compton carried the side 's responsibilities and defied a first @-@ class attack in such trying circumstances " . Compton 's fall at 405 / 7 exposed the bowlers and Australia quickly finished off the innings within half an hour . England finished at 441 , leaving Australia a target of 98 . Lindwall 's absence meant that the remaining four frontline bowlers had to bowl more than 32 overs each — Johnston bowled 59 and ended with 4 / 147 while Miller took 4 / 125 from 44 overs . Australia progressed steadily to 38 before Bedser bowled Morris for nine and then dismissed Bradman for a duck , again caught by Hutton at short fine leg . This left Australia 48 / 2 . Hassett joined Barnes and they reached the target without further loss . Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries . 
 = = = Second Test = = = 
 Australia retained the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge . On the other hand , England made three changes ; the leg spinner Wright had regained fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox of Young , all rounder Coxon made his Test debut in place of Barnett and Dollery replaced Hardstaff as the No. 5 @.@ batsman . Following his injury in the previous Test , Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning and was only included after protesting to Bradman , who gambled on his inclusion . Australia won the toss and elected to bat . Miller played , but was unfit to bowl . 
 Barnes fell for a duck , and Morris and Bradman rebuilt the innings , slowly taking the score to 87 before Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time by Hutton in the leg trap off Bedser . In the meantime , Morris , after a slow start , made 105 runs out of a total of 166 scored while he was at the wicket , including 14 fours and one six . His innings was noted for powerful , well @-@ placed cover drives . His dismissal left Australia at 166 / 3 , quickly followed by Miller , left Australia at 173 / 4 . Hassett and Brown rebuilt the innings slowly , taking more than three and half minutes on average for each run . Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley removed him and Brown in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225 / 6 . Johnson fell soon after and England were well placed when Australia ended the day on 258 / 7 . 
 Australia 's lower order batted the tourists into control on the second morning . Tallon batted on , supported by Johnston and Toshack , who scored their highest Test scores . Australia 's wicket @-@ keeper put on 45 with Johnston — who scored 29 . Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston fell . Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers , ending with 4 / 100 from 43 overs , while debutant Coxon took 2 / 90 from 35 overs . 
 Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball . He persevered through the pain and removed Washbrook in his fourth over . Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32 / 2 . Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later . England were 46 / 4 and Australia were firmly in control . Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings , scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes . After the tea break , Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball . Compton edged Johnston to be out for 53 . One run later , Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134 / 6 with their skipper dismissed for 44 . Johnson then removed Evans for nine , before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket . After 85 minutes of resistance , Johnston removed both . England 's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9 / 207 . 
 On the third morning , Lindwall removed Bedser , ending England 's innings at 215 , giving Australia a 135 first innings lead . Lindwall ended with 5 / 70 . The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings . Barnes was given an early life and he took advantage to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122 before Morris was bowled for 62 . Bradman joined Barnes at the crease and they amassed 174 runs for the second wicket . Barnes accelerated after reaching his half @-@ century . Once he reached his century , Barnes became particularly aggressive . He dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs , including two successive sixes before finally falling for 141 , caught on the boundary from Yardley . He had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings . The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to be 296 / 2 after 277 minutes when he departed . Hassett was bowled first ball , so Miller came to the crease at 296 / 3 to face Yardley 's hat @-@ trick ball . Miller survived a loud leg before wicket appeal on the hat @-@ trick ball . Bradman fell to Bedser again , this time for 89 . Brown joined Miller at 329 / 4 and Australia reached stumps at 343 , without further loss . 
 After the rest day , the fourth morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages . In 88 minutes of play , Australia added a further 117 runs . Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87 @-@ run partnership with Miller , who was out for 74 , followed by Lindwall for 25 . Bradman declared with Australia at 460 / 7 , 595 runs ahead . Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket @-@ takers , with two each . 
 Further showers breathed extra life into the pitch , and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball , troubling the English batsmen . Hutton was dropped before he had scored and played and missed multiple times . Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42 , before Hutton edged Lindwall and was out for 13 . Toshack removed Edrich and Washbrook in quick succession to leave England at 65 / 3 . However , Compton and Dollery added 41 to have England close at 106 / 3 . 
 The final day started poorly for England , with Compton being caught off Johnston from the second ball of the day . Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack took two wickets in the same over . Eight runs later , Dollery was bowled from a Lindwall bouncer that stayed low . Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141 / 8 . England were bowled out for 186 , ceding a 409 @-@ run victory . Toshack ended the innings with 5 / 40 , while Lindwall and Johnston took three and two respectively . The gross attendance was 132 @,@ 000 and receipts were £ 43 @,@ 000 — a record for a Test in England . 
 = = = Third Test = = = 
 When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test , Hutton had been dropped . The reason was said to be Hutton 's struggles with Lindwall 's short @-@ pitched bowling . The omission generated considerable <unk> and the Australians were pleased , feeling that Hutton was England 's best batsman . Hutton 's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett . England made three further changes . Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in the bowling department . Coxon was replaced by debutant batsman Jack Crapp . Australia dropped Brown , who had scored 73 runs at 24 @.@ 33 in three innings , for the all rounder Loxton . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . 
 The change in England 's opening pair did not result in better results . A run out was narrowly avoided from the first ball , and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that helped the bowlers . Both fell early , leaving England 28 / 2 . Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves . Compton attempted to hook a Lindwall bouncer , but edged it into his face . This forced him to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33 / 2 . Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting , resulting in one 25 @-@ minute period where only one run was added . They reached lunch at 57 / 2 . Upon the resumption , Crapp accelerated , hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson . Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37 . Dollery then fell for one . England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97 / 4 . After 170 minutes of slow batting , Edrich fell to Lindwall . At 119 / 5 , Compton returned to the field , his wound having been stitched . Yardley fell for 22 with the score at 141 / 6 , bringing Evans to the crease . Compton and Evans added 75 runs , before Lindwall removed the latter to leave England at 216 / 7 . 
 England resumed on the second day at 231 / 7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball . Bedser defied the Australians for 145 minutes , adding 37 and featuring in a 121 @-@ run partnership with Compton . Soon after , Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes , who was standing at short leg , forcing him into hospital . The last two wickets fell and England were bowled out for 363 . Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting , having struck 16 fours . Lindwall took 4 / 99 and Johnston 3 / 67 . 
 Barnes 's injury left Australia with only Morris as a specialist opener . Johnson was deployed as Australia 's makeshift second opener , but made only one , and Bradman fell for seven to leave Australia at 13 / 2 . Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings , adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett fell . Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126 / 3 at stumps . 
 Australia had added only nine runs on the third morning when Miller fell for 31 . Four runs later , Morris fell for 51 , leaving Australia 139 / 5 . Barnes came in , despite having collapsed in the nets due to the lingering effects of the blow to his chest . He made a painful single before the pain forced him back to hospital . Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before Tallon fell . Lindwall came into bat at 172 / 6 with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on . Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled , leaving Australia 208 / 7 , five runs behind the follow @-@ on mark . Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow on before Bedser removed both and Australia were bowled out for 221 , giving England a lead of 142 runs . During his innings , Lindwall was given a series of bouncers by Edrich . One of the short @-@ pitched balls hit Lindwall in the hand , evoking cheers from the crowd . Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers , taking 4 / 81 and 3 / 53 respectively . 
 Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at the start of the second innings , bringing his tormentor Edrich to the crease . Lindwall did not bounce Edrich , but Miller did , earning the ire of the crowd . Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124 @-@ run partnership in only 138 minutes . This was aided three dropped catches from Washbrook . Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six , but was immediately run out by Morris with a direct hit . Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball , as England reached 174 / 3 at the close , with Washbrook unbeaten on 85 . 
 The rest day was followed by the fourth day , which was abandoned due to persistent rain . Yardley declared at the start of the fifth day , leaving Australia a victory target of 317 , but the rain meant that the entire first session was lost . The tourists batted in a defensive manner to ensure a draw . They ended at 92 / 1 in 61 overs . Morris finished unbeaten on 54 , his fourth consecutive half @-@ century of the Test series . The attendance of 133 @,@ 740 exceeded the previous Test . 
 = = = Fourth Test = = = 
 Australia made two changes for the Test . Harvey replaced the injured Barnes , while Saggers replaced the injured Tallon behind the stumps . England made three changes . Emmett was dropped and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position . Laker replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young . Dollery , who had made only 38 in three innings , was replaced by all @-@ rounder Cranston . 
 England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch . Hutton and Washbrook put on an opening partnership of 168 , the best by England in the series . Washbrook refrained from the hook shot , which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series . The partnership was ended when Hutton was bowled by Lindwall . Washbrook reached his century and joined by Edrich , the pair batted until late in the first day , when Washbrook was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over of the day . His innings had included 22 boundaries and ended a second @-@ wicket partnership that yielded exactly 100 runs . Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman and survived as England closed at 268 / 2 , with Edrich on 41 . 
 The next day , Bedser batted on in steady support of Edrich . The pair saw England to lunch without further loss , and 155 runs were added for the third wicket before Bedser was out after almost three hours of batting for 79 . Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes . Edrich fell three runs later at 426 / 4 for 111 . With two new batsmen at the crease , Australia quickly made further inroads to leave England at 473 / 6 . Loxton then successively removed Cranston , Evans and Laker as England fell from 486 / 6 to 496 / 9 , before Miller bowled Yardley to end England 's innings at 496 . The home team had lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 73 runs . Loxton took 3 / 55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two . Australia lost the services of Toshack after he broke down with a knee injury . With Barnes injured , Hassett was moved from the middle order to open the innings with Morris . Morris fell for six , before Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists to stumps at 63 / 1 . Bradman did the majority of the scoring , finishing unbeaten on 31 . 
 On the third morning , England made the ideal start when Pollard removed Hassett for 13 and Bradman for 33 in the same over . This left Australia struggling at 68 / 3 . Harvey , playing his first Ashes Test , joined Miller at the crease . Australia were more than 400 behind and Harvey told his senior partner " Let 's get stuck into ' em " . If England were to remove the pair , they would expose Australia 's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to win by taking a substantial lead . The pair launched a counterattack , with Miller taking the lead with many lofted boundaries . This allowed Australia to seize the initiative , with Harvey joining in and hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker . Miller was dismissed by Yardley for 58 while attempting another six , but the partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes , prompting Wisden to liken it to a " hurricane " . Harvey then shared another century stand with Loxton which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes . Harvey ended with a century on his Ashes debut , scoring 112 from 183 balls in an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket . The high rate of scoring during the innings freed the match from England 's firm control . Loxton was particularly severe on Laker , lifting his deliveries into the crowd for five sixes in addition to nine fours . At the other end , Harvey and Johnson fell to Laker in quick succession to leave the score at 329 / 6 . 
 Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall replaced Johnson , and 15 runs later , Yardley bowled Loxton for 93 , while Saggers only managed five , leaving Australia at 355 / 8 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining . Lindwall hit out , scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling , dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively . He was the last man out at 458 , leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings . Bedser took the final wicket to end with 3 / 92 . Laker took 3 / 113 , while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each . 
 England set about extending their first innings lead for the remainder of the fourth day . For the second time in the match , Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership . Washbrook made 65 and Hutton 57 , leaving England at 129 / 2 . Edrich and Compton continued where the openers had left off , adding 103 before Lindwall trapped Edrich lbw for 54 . England lost wickets at regular intervals late in the day to be 278 / 6 . When Johnston removed Compton for 66 , England were 7 / 293 with no recognised batsmen remaining , having lost 4 / 33 . Wicket @-@ keeper Evans led a rearguard action as England reached 362 / 8 at the close of the fourth day . 
 England batted on for five minutes on the final morning , adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 365 / 8 , with Evans on 47 not out . Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures , with 4 / 95 . Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller , which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin . This left Australia a target of 404 runs for victory . At the time , this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side . Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target , and the local press wrote them off , predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers . Morris and Hassett started slowly on a pitch that offered spin and bounce . Only 44 runs came in the first hour . Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton 's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57 . Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes and they began to attack ; Morris hit three consecutive fours off Len Hutton 's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121 / 1 . In the half hour preceding the interval , Australia had added 64 runs . Both had given chances , but England fumbled them . 
 Upon resumption , Morris severely attacked Compton , who had been bowling in an attempt to exploit the spin , aided by a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs . This prompted Yardley to take the new ball . Australia reached 202 , halfway to the required total , with 165 minutes left . Morris passed his century , and was then dropped on 126 . Bradman was given another life at 108 when Evans missed a stumping opportunity . Australia reached tea at 288 / 1 with Morris on 150 . The pair had added 167 during the session . Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182 , having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes . He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting . This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required . He fell with eight runs still needed . Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs . Australia had won by seven wickets , setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run @-@ chase , with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes with 29 fours . The attendance of 158 @,@ 000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34 @,@ 000 pounds . The attendance remains a record for a Test in England . 
 = = = Fifth Test = = = 
 With the series already lost , England made four changes to their team . Dewes replaced the injured Washbrook , while Watkins replaced Cranston as an all @-@ rounder . Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut . England played two spinners ; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker , while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard 's pace . The selectors were widely condemned for their incessant changes . Australia made three changes . Off spinner Johnson was replaced by the leg spin of Ring . Australia 's second change was forced on them ; the injured seamer Toshack was replaced by the recovered batsman Barnes . The final change was the return of wicket @-@ keeper Tallon from injury . 
 The match saw Lindwall at his best . English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain @-@ affected pitch . Precipitation during the week meant that the start of the Test was delayed until the afternoon . The humid conditions , along with the rain , assisted the bowlers , with Lindwall in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights . 
 Miller bowled Dewes for one with his second ball to leave England at 2 / 1 , before Johnston removed Edrich for three to leave England at 10 / 2 . Lindwall dismissed Compton after Morris had taken a diving catch , and Miller then removed Crapp , who failed to score in his 23 @-@ ball innings , leaving England at 23 / 4 . 
 After the lunch break , England had struggled to 35 / 4 , before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker . The debutant Watkins then batted for 16 balls without scoring before Johnston dismissed him for a duck to leave England at 42 / 6 . Watkins also collected a bruise on the shoulder that inhibited his bowling later in the match . Lindwall then removed Evans , Bedser and Young , all yorked in the space of two runs . The innings ended at 52 when Hutton leg glanced and was caught by wicket @-@ keeper Tallon , who grasped the ball one @-@ handed at full stretch to his left . In his post @-@ lunch spell , Lindwall bowled 8 @.@ 1 overs , taking five wickets for eight runs , finishing with 6 / 20 in 16 @.@ 1 overs . Bradman described the spell as " the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket " . Hutton was the only batsman to resist , scoring 30 in 124 minutes from 147 deliveries . No other player passed seven . Miller and Johnston took 2 / 5 and 2 / 20 respectively , and Ring was not needed to bowl . 
 In contrast , Australia batted with apparent ease , and Morris and Barnes passed England 's first innings total by themselves . The score had reached 117 before Barnes fell to Hollies for 61 , ending a partnership that had taken only 126 minutes . This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day . As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level , the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once . The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat . Yardley led his team in giving Bradman three cheers . With 6996 Test career runs , he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket , but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly . Hassett came in at 117 / 2 and Australia closed at 153 / 2 . Morris was unbeaten on 77 . 
 On the second morning , Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109 @-@ run stand ended with Hassett 's fall for 37 . The following four batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease and none passed 20 . Morris was finally removed for 196 , ending an innings noted for his hooking and off @-@ driving ; it took a run out to remove Morris . Australia were eventually out for 389 . Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies , who took 5 / 131 . England had relied heavily on spin ; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners . 
 England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears . Lindwall made the early breakthrough , and Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the innings to close at the end of the second day on 54 / 1 . 
 Early on the third day , Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28 , before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes . On 39 , Compton fell to a reflex catch by Lindwall . Hutton managed to continue resisting before edging Miller to Tallon for 64 , having top @-@ scored in both innings , to leave England at 153 / 4 . Thereafter , England collapsed in the fading light , . prompting the umpires to call off play . The ground was then hit by rain , resulting in a premature end to the day 's play . England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178 / 7 . 
 England resumed on the fourth morning and Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs . Johnston ended with 4 / 40 and Lindwall 3 / 50 . This result sealed the series 4 – 0 in favour of Australia . The match was followed by a series of congratulatory speeches .

 = = = v Worcestershire = = = 
 At Worcester , 28 , 29 , 30 April . Worcestershire ( 233 and 212 ) lost to the Australians ( 462 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 17 runs . 
 The pitch was slow , and the weather was cold and showery for the traditional tour opener against Worcestershire . Worcester attracted a record attendance of 32 @,@ 000 with takings of more than ₤ 4000 . The hosts elected to bat , and started strongly as a century second @-@ wicket stand took them to 137 / 1 after 133 minutes . However , the dismissal of Charles Palmer , who top @-@ scored with 85 , precipitated a collapse and they lost their last nine wickets in two hours to be all out for 233 . Five Australian bowlers shared the wickets , with Johnson taking 3 / 52 . In their sole innings , Australia took the initiative from the outset through a 166 @-@ run second @-@ wicket stand between Morris ( 138 ) and Bradman ( 107 ) . This took them to 265 / 1 , before they declared at 462 / 8 after Miller had hit an unbeaten 50 in faster than even time . Off spinner Peter Jackson took 6 / 135 for the locals . In their second innings Worcestershire were bowled out by Australia for 212 runs , with 70 minutes to spare . McCool took 4 / 29 as the spinners took eight of the wickets . 
 = = = v Leicestershire = = = 
 At Leicester , 1 , 3 , 4 May . The Australians ( 448 ) defeated Leicestershire ( 130 and 147 ) by an innings and 171 runs . 
 Australia elected to bat , and Miller , who had been promoted to No. 3 , shared century partnerships with Barnes ( 78 ) and Bradman ( 81 ) . A middle @-@ order collapse then ensued as the remaining Australians struggled against the local spin attack , but last man Johnston managed to hold up his end in a 37 @-@ run last @-@ wicket partnership that allowed Miller to reach his double century . He ended on 202 not out as Australia were dismissed for 448 . The Australian @-@ born slow bowler Vic Jackson was the best Leicestershire bowler , taking 5 / 91 . Leicestershire scored only 130 in their first innings ; another Australian expatriate , Jack Walsh , top @-@ scored with 33 . Ring took 5 / 34 and the hosts hampered their batting efforts with two run outs . Australia enforced the follow on and Leicestershire faced the prospect of being bowled out twice in a day after Johnson took the first wickets to have them 5 / 83 . After a rain delay Australia took the final five wickets for 34 runs in an hour on the final day ; Leicestershire were all out for 147 in an innings defeat . Johnson ended with 7 / 42 . 
 = = = v Yorkshire = = = 
 At Bradford , 5 , 6 May . Yorkshire ( 71 and 89 ) lost to the Australians ( 101 and 63 / 6 ) by four wickets . 
 This low @-@ scoring game was the closest that Australia came to defeat on the tour . The game was played in cold , blustery , overcast and wet conditions that suited spin bowlers . Yorkshire made only 71 in their first innings . Miller mixed medium @-@ paced off @-@ breaks with his fast bowling and this combination returned him 6 / 42 . At the other end Johnston bowled his left arm orthodox spin and took 4 / 22 from 26 overs . Together the pair bowled almost unchanged , delivering 49 @.@ 3 of 54 @.@ 3 overs . Australia struggled in reply and stumps were called when they fell to 4 / 38 . 
 Miller came in at the start of the second day 's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added , before falling at 7 / 86 , part of a collapse of 5 / 27 . He hit two sixes in his innings , including one from the first ball that he faced , feeling that a defensive strategy would be almost impossible in the difficult conditions . Australia ended at 101 , and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury . Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire , 6 / 51 . Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings , which followed a similar pattern to their first effort . Wickets fell steadily as Johnston ( 6 / 18 ) and Miller ( 3 / 49 ) bowled 31 @.@ 2 of the 36 @.@ 2 overs . 
 Australia were set a target of 60 runs for victory , and Hassett elected to not have the pitch rolled . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett " might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [ erratic bounce and sideways movement ] out of the pitch " . Hassett and Hamence both fell with the score on 20 to leave Australia five down . Australia slumped to 6 / 31 , effectively seven down with Loxton incapacitated by injury , but scraped home without further loss with Harvey and Tallon at the crease . Harvey was given two chances , once when he was on one , and Tallon was also missed . It would have been their first defeat against an English county since 1912 , but Harvey won the game with a straight drive over the fence . Wickets had fallen at less than 10 runs apiece , and at the rate of every four overs . 
 = = = v Surrey = = = 
 At The Oval , 8 , 10 , 11 May . The Australians ( 632 ) defeated Surrey ( 141 and 195 ) by an innings and 296 runs . 
 Australia won the toss and Barnes and Morris put on 136 for the opening stand before the latter fell for 65 . Barnes and Bradman then added 207 for the second wicket . Barnes ' 176 came in 255 minutes and Bradman made 146 in 165 minutes . After Bradman departed at 403 / 3 , wickets began to fall more regularly , but Hassett held up his end and made 110 , while Tallon remained unbeaten on 50 . Surrey 's Test paceman Alec Bedser took 4 / 104 . On the second afternoon , Surrey scored 141 runs in three hours in their first innings . Johnson took 5 / 53 and Laurie Fishlock carried his bat for 81 not out , but received little support , the next highest scores being 15 and 10 . Australia enforced the follow on and took two early wickets before stumps on the second day . They made continual inroads on the final day , and Surrey were all out for 195 to complete an innings win . Johnston took 4 / 40 and Johnson 3 / 40 . 
 = = = v Cambridge University = = = 
 At Fenner 's , Cambridge , 12 , 13 , 14 May . Cambridge University ( 167 and 196 ) lost to the Australians ( 414 / 4 declared ) by an innings and 51 runs . 
 Cambridge elected to bat and wickets fell regularly . No player made over 33 and the hosts were out in the second session of the first day for 167 . Miller was prominent with the ball and in the field , taking 5 / 46 and two catches for his fellow bowlers . In reply , Australia were already 184 / 1 at stumps , with Brown heading for a consecutive century . He put on 176 for the second wicket with Hamence , who made 92 . Brown reached 200 and was out immediately thereafter , prompting stand @-@ in skipper Hassett to declare midway through the second day at 414 / 4 , having reached 61 not out himself . In their second innings Cambridge failed to cope with the leg @-@ spin of McCool , who took 7 / 78 as the match ended early on the third morning . Attendance over the three days was nearly 25 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = v Essex = = = 
 At Southend , 15 , 17 May . The Australians ( 721 ) defeated Essex ( 83 and 187 ) by an innings and 451 runs . 
 After electing to bat , Australia made history on the first day by breaking the record for the most runs scored in a first @-@ class match in a day . Ironically , it was the only time they were dismissed in a single day on the entire tour . With centuries from Brown ( 153 ) , Bradman ( 187 ) , Loxton ( 120 ) and Saggers ( 104 * ) , Australia 's first innings totalled 721 ; they were dismissed on the close of the first day 's play . Bradman 's 187 came in 155 minutes and Brown 's 153 lasted three hours ; the pair put on 219 in 90 minutes after Barnes fell for 79 at 145 / 1 . Bradman came in and seized the initiative , reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch , including five fours from one over by Frank <unk> which subsequently entered Essex club folklore . Bradman and Brown were parted when the latter fell at 364 / 2 only halfway through the day 's play . Miller then famously deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball as a protest against Australia 's merciless crushing of their hosts , something that angered his captain and batting partner Bradman . Miller later told Dickie Bird that he had wanted to go to the local horse races , but this was refused by Bradman . The all rounder therefore made his duck in protest , but still did not get to go to the races . Later , Loxton and Saggers made 166 in 65 minutes for the sixth wicket , before an late @-@ order collapse saw Australia lose 5 / 57 , leaving Saggers unbeaten , but not before he reached the only first @-@ class century of his career . After being demoralised by the Australian batsmen on the first day , Essex made only 83 in their first innings , capitulating within 37 overs . Toshack took 5 / 31 and Miller 3 / 14 , and Australia enforced the follow @-@ on . Essex 's second innings appeared to be heading the same way when four early wickets to Johnson had them at 46 / 6 . However , a partnership of 133 between Tom Pearce and Peter Smith for the seventh wicket salvaged some respectability before they were out for 187 . Johnson ended with 6 / 37 as the Australians dismissed their hosts twice in a single day . The ground attendance of 32 @,@ 000 was a record . 
 = = = v Oxford University = = = 
 At Oxford , 19 , 20 , 21 May . The Australians ( 431 ) defeated Oxford University ( 185 and 156 ) by an innings and 90 runs . 
 Australia batted first after Hassett won the toss , and the opening pair of Brown and Morris put on 139 . Brown scored his third century in succession , before being out lbw to Indian Test player Abdul Hafeez Kardar for 108 . Morris , Loxton , McCool and Ring all reached 50 as the Australians posted 431 . Oxford 's best batting performance came in the form of a 75 @-@ run partnership between Geoffrey Keighley and Kardar in their first innings , resisting the spin bowlers on the dry wicket . Despite Kardar 's innings of 54 and 29 , the top @-@ score in both innings , Australia won by an innings and 90 runs as wickets fell steadily . The wickets were spread evenly among the tourists ; Toshack took three in each innings , while Johnston and McCool totalled four for the match . 
 = = = v Marylebone Cricket Club = = = 
 At Lord 's , 22 , 24 , 25 May . The Australians ( 552 ) defeated Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) ( 189 and 205 ) by an innings and 158 runs . 
 The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and with two other capped players , were basically a full strength Test team , as were Australia , who fielded their first @-@ choice team . Barring one change in the bowling department , the same team lined up for Australia in the First Test , with the top six batsmen in the same position . It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage . After winning the toss , Australia batted first . After the loss of Morris early , Barnes ( 81 ) and Bradman ( 98 ) set about regaining the ascendancy with a 160 @-@ run stand . Bradman scored eleven fours in his 98 , which took two hours , and Hassett then took over and added 51 . Miller then saw Australia to stumps at 407 / 5 . He continued the next day and Australia 's highest scorer with 163 , and Johnson supported him with 80 . Despite a collapse which saw the last five wickets fall for 54 runs following the pair 's departure , Australia reached 552 . Bradman 's batsmen gained a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests by attacking the off spin of Jim Laker . They hit nine sixes from the English Test representative on the second morning . 
 Miller and Lindwall then sought to gain an advantage over England 's leading batsmen — Hutton and Compton — before the Tests . The MCC side , composed almost entirely of Test players , reached 91 / 2 , Toshack removed Compton and Hutton in quick succession to reduce the hosts to 104 / 5 . He took three more wickets to end with 6 / 51 as the MCC were eventually dismissed for 189 , conceding a first innings lead of 363 runs . Some English observers decried Toshack 's leg stump attack as being negative , but former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Toshack 's line was close enough to leg stump that most balls had to be played . Bradman opted to enforce the follow on , and his spinners did most of the damage , McCool taking 4 / 35 and Johnson 3 / 37 . Only Len Hutton of the locals batsmen passed 26 during the match , scoring 52 and 64 , and Australia had taken a key psychological victory ahead of the Tests with an innings victory . The total attendance was 60 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = v Lancashire = = = 
 At Manchester , 26 , 27 , 28 May . The Australians ( 204 and 259 / 4 ) drew with Lancashire ( 182 ) . 
 The first day was abandoned due to rain . Australia lost the toss and were sent in to bat on a drying pitch . The 19 @-@ year @-@ old Lancashire spin bowler Malcolm Hilton took Bradman 's wicket twice in the match , causing a media sensation . Hilton bowled Bradman with an arm ball for 11 , the Australian captain 's first score on tour below 80 . The Australian batsmen failed to capitalise on their starts as six were dismissed between 20 and 40 . Australia looked set to concede a lead for the first time on tour as the hosts reached 3 / 129 , but Johnston ( 5 / 49 ) took five of the last seven wickets for 28 runs in Lancashire 's only innings , which ended on the third morning . With a result impossible , Australia had time for batting practice . Bradman reached 43 , and when Hilton came on , the Australian captain , perhaps perturbed by earlier events , attempted to hit the spinner out of the attack . After missing the first two balls , Bradman charged the third , swung and missed , fell over and was stumped . Harvey ( 76 * ) and Hamence ( 49 * ) shared an unbeaten fifth @-@ wicket partnership of 122 after Loxton made 52 . 
 = = = v Nottinghamshire = = = 
 At Nottingham , 29 , 31 May 1 June . Nottinghamshire ( 179 and 299 / 8 ) drew with the Australians ( 400 ) . 
 In Nottinghamshire 's first innings , Ray Lindwall took 6 / 14 from 15 @.@ 1 overs , with only 10 scoring strokes being made off him . Reg Simpson made 74 and Joe Hardstaff junior 48 , but only one other batsman reached double figures . After their 98 @-@ run third @-@ wicket stand was broken , Australia took 8 / 68 to bowl the hosts out for 179 . Lindwall , conceded less than a run per over . Only ten of his balls were scored from and not a single run was taken from his last 30 balls . Fingleton said that Lindwall " absolutely paralysed " the batsmen , with some of his bowling " in the real Larwood manner " . Australia only batted once , and Brown top @-@ scored with 122 in 3 hours 45 minutes , while Bradman added 86 . The Australia middle @-@ order fell away and the tourists lost their last six wickets for 74 runs . In the county 's second innings , Keeton was hit in the chest by one of Lindwall 's deliveries and took no further part in the match . On the final day , Hardstaff hit the first century against the Australians on the tour , 107 , and Simpson again batted well , making 70 . Lindwall and the Australian pacemen were less incisive in the second innings , and Ring and Johnson took four and three wickets respectively . 
 = = = v Hampshire = = = 
 At Southampton , 2 , 3 , 4 June . Hampshire ( 195 and 103 ) lost to the Australians ( 117 and 182 / 2 ) by eight wickets . 
 Hampshire won the toss and elected to bat against the Australians , who were led by Hassett while Bradman rested . The Australians were behind on the first innings for the first time on the tour and the match remained in the balance until the third afternoon . On a drying pitch , the hosts reached 116 / 3 before losing their remaining wickets for 79 to be all out for 195 , while Johnston took 6 / 74 . In reply , Australia fared worse and collapsed from 2 / 70 and made only 117 . Charles Knott 's off spin proved challenging for the Australians , but Miller scored three successive sixes from him before the collapse , top @-@ scoring with 39 . In their second innings , both Miller and Johnston took five Hampshire wickets . John Arnold top @-@ scored for the hosts in both innings , with 48 and 42 . Australia needed 182 runs in 175 minutes to win . Barnes went for a duck but Johnson , sent in five minutes before lunch , hit 74 out of a second @-@ wicket partnership of 105 , including three sixes and seven fours . Brown , with 81 not out , and Hassett saw the Australians through to victory . 
 = = = v Sussex = = = 
 At Hove , 5 , 7 June . Sussex ( 86 and 138 ) lost to the Australians ( 549 / 5 declared ) by an innings and 325 runs . 
 Lindwall won the match for the Australians with his bowling , taking 11 / 59 . After winning the toss , the Sussex batsmen struggled with his length and variation of pace , and he hit the off @-@ stump five times in the first innings alone to end with 6 / 34 . Loxton also bowled well in the first innings , taking 3 / 13 . Australia replied to Sussex 's 86 strongly , and were already 254 / 1 by the end of the first day . Powered by Morris 's 184 and with centuries too for Bradman ( 109 ) and Harvey ( 100 * ) , Australia added a further 295 runs on the second day to declare at 549 / 5 . They then still had time to send down 63 @.@ 3 overs , enough to finish the match within two days . In Sussex 's second innings Lindwall took two wickets in the first over . Harry Parks made 61 , but Sussex were all out for 138 , losing their last seven wickets for 59 . In all , eight of Lindwall 's wickets were bowled , five these by swinging yorkers , the batsmen unable to counter the swerving deliveries . Fingleton said that " Lindwall bundled the stumps over in all directions " as Sussex " crumpled completely ... in as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew " . At the other end , Toshack helped to pin down the batsmen for Lindwall . He delivered 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots for a total of six runs . 
 = = = v Northamptonshire = = = 
 At Northampton , 16 , 17 , 18 June . Northamptonshire ( 119 and 169 ) lost to the Australians ( 352 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 64 runs . 
 Starting the day after the First Test , the Northamptonshire match was interrupted by rain . Northamptonshire batted first and collapsed to 7 / 61 before some tail @-@ end resistance took them to 119 ; Johnston and Johnson took three wickets each . The Australians passed the locals ' score on the first afternoon , and their innings was built around Hassett 's 127 , which included 17 fours . Morris and McCool also made fifties . Northamptonshire made 169 runs in their second innings , Johnston and Ring taking four wickets each . In neither of the county innings did any player reach 50 . 
 = = = v Yorkshire = = = 
 At Sheffield , 19 , 21 , 22 June . The Australians ( 249 and 285 / 5 declared ) drew with Yorkshire ( 206 and 85 / 4 ) . 
 The Australians were made to work hard for their 249 , with only Bradman reaching 50 . Harvey and Hamence passed 40 but could not convert their starts into large scores . Alec Coxon took 4 / 66 for the hosts and was selected for the Second Test . Yorkshire made 206 in reply , Toshack taking 7 / 81 and Johnston 3 / 101 : together , they bowled 81 @.@ 1 of the 90 @.@ 1 overs in the innings . Like the Australians , the local batsmen struggled to make the most of their starts ; eight batsmen reached double figures but none passed 40 . Not wanting to tire his bowlers ahead of the Second Test , Bradman declared Australia 's second innings with a lead of 328 runs and only seventy minutes of play remaining . Brown hit 113 and Bradman himself 86 , putting on 154 for the second wicket . Yardley expressed his displeasure by bowling his part @-@ timers and then promoting tailenders to the upper half of the order in the second innings . The Australians batted in leisurely fashion with no urgency to force a result . Bradman then allowed his second @-@ string bowlers to deliver 24 of the 27 overs as the match petered into a draw . The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators . 
 = = = v Surrey = = = 
 At The Oval , 30 June , 1 – 2 July . Surrey ( 221 and 289 ) lost to The Australians ( 389 and 122 / 0 ) by 10 wickets . 
 Australia won the toss and sent Surrey in to bat . They made 221 , and Jack Parker top @-@ scored with 76 in an uneven effort in which there were six single @-@ figure scores . As the match started the day after the Second Test , Bradman let most of his second @-@ string bowlers do the work to rest his first @-@ choice bowlers , and Ring took three wickets , while the Test players only took two in total . Hamence opened the batting for Australia — Brown injured a finger while fielding — but he was out for a duck . Hassett ( 139 ) and Bradman ( 128 ) then put on 231 , Bradman making his sixth century of the tour . However , the Australians lost wickets steadily thereafter to be all out for 389 . Surrey made 289 in their second innings , with McCool taking 6 / 113 after bowling more than 40 % of the overs . The hosts batted steadily with three fifties , but wickets fell regularly and only one partnership greater than 40 materialised . The tourists wanted to finish the run @-@ chase quickly so they could watch fellow Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final . Harvey and Loxton volunteered and chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10 @-@ wicket win in just 20 @.@ 1 overs . Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time . 
 = = = v Gloucestershire = = = 
 At Bristol , 3 , 5 , 6 July . The Australians ( 774 / 7 declared ) defeated Gloucestershire ( 279 and 132 ) by an innings and 363 runs . 
 The Australians elected to bat and made the highest score of the tour , and it was also the second biggest score by an Australian team in England ( the 1893 team made 843 against a " Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present " at Portsmouth ) , and the highest score by an Australian team versus an English county . Morris 's 290 , made from 466 balls in five hours , was the highest individual score of the tour , and he featured in century stands with Barnes , Miller and Harvey . Loxton made 159 not out , Harvey 95 and McCool 76 . This match preceded the Third Test , and off spinner Tom Goddard was regarded as a candidate for England selection after strong performances in county cricket . However , Morris and Loxton 's aggressive attack gave Goddard figures of 0 / 186 from 32 overs , effectively ending his chances of selection . Former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said " Tom [ Goddard ] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [ shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking ] to him and that gets him many wickets . " Instead , it was Loxton who forced his way into the Third Test . 
 Gloucestershire replied with an innings of 279 , in which Jack Crapp made 100 not out , while Johnson took 6 / 68 . Made to follow on during the final day , the hosts made only 132 , losing their last eight wickets for 60 . Johnson took 5 / 32 to end with 11 / 100 for the match , while Ring took 5 / 47 to end with seven for the match . Australia 's spinners took 19 wickets .

At one stage , Australia were 53 / 3 , but Morris ( 109 ) and Loxton ( 123 ) put on a partnership of 172 . No other batsman bettered Hamence 's 30 , and Jim Sims took 6 / 65 as the Australians collapsed and lost their last six wickets for 46 . Middlesex scored 135 in their second innings , with only John Dewes ( 51 ) and Leslie Compton resisting the tourists , while eight managed only single figures .

Loxton later made 51 as the Australians fell away late in the innings , losing 7 / 142 . Derbyshire made 240 in their first innings with the future Test umpire Charlie Elliott top @-@ scoring with 57 , while Miller , Johnston and Ring taking three wicket apiece . The county followed on 216 behind after losing their last six wickets for 64 runs . In their second innings they made 182 , with Denis Smith making 88 , the highest individual score ever made by a Derbyshire player against the Australians . However , only one other player reached double figures , as McCool precipitated a collapse of 9 / 72 , taking 6 / 77 , while Loxton took 3 / 16 . There was a Derbyshire record attendance of 17 @,@ 000 on the first day . 
 = = = v Glamorgan = = = 
 At Swansea , 31 July , 2 – 3 August . Glamorgan ( 197 ) drew with the Australians ( 215 / 3 ) . 
 Rain prevented play after 3pm on the second day . No one scored more than 40 as Glamorgan elected to bat and made 197 , with the four Australian bowlers , Lindwall , Miller , Johnson and Ring sharing the wickets . The Australians ' 215 / 3 was based on an aggressive 84 from Miller , with five sixes and seven fours , and a partnership of 126 with stand @-@ in Hassett , who was 71 not out when the rain came . The attendance on the two days of play totalled 50 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = v Warwickshire = = = 
 At Birmingham , 4 , 5 , 6 August . Warwickshire ( 138 and 155 ) lost to the Australians ( 254 and 41 / 1 ) by nine wickets . 
 Bradman put Warwickshire in to bat on a wet pitch and the hosts struggled to 138 in an innings that lasted almost 80 overs . Martin Donnelly ( 28 ) was the only batsman to pass 20 , and Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets each . Australia scored 254 in reply ; Hassett top @-@ scored with 68 , Lindwall made 45 , and the pair 's partnership of 70 was the highest of the match . Three other batsmen reached 30 , but most of the Australians were uncomfortable against the leg spin of Eric Hollies , who opened the bowling and took 8 / 107 , the best innings analysis against the Australians on the whole tour . This performance earned the Warwickshire bowler a call @-@ up for the fifth and final Test . In their second innings Warwickshire made 155 runs , Johnston and McCool taking four wickets each , the former conceding only 32 from 39 overs . Australia made the required 41 by lunch on the third day .

 At Old Trafford , Manchester , 7 , 9 , 10 August . The Australians ( 321 and 265 / 3 declared ) drew with Lancashire ( 130 and 199 / 7 ) . 
 Cyril Washbrook 's benefit match brought him a then record sum , £ 14 @,@ 000 , but it was a mixed experience because he injured his right thumb whilst facing Lindwall and withdrew from the England team for the Fifth Test . The Australians scored 321 in their first innings with only Barnes ( 67 ) reaching 50 . Nine of the Australians made a start , reaching 14 , but could not capitalise on their opportunities , and they lost wickets at regular intervals after an opening stand of 123 . The slow left @-@ arm bowler William Roberts took 6 / 73 . Lancashire replied with 130 of which Washbrook made 38 , while Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets apiece , but the Australians did not enforce the follow on . Australia made 265 / 5 declared and Bradman scored an unbeaten 133 , his highest at Old Trafford , with 90 for Barnes . Bradman declared at lunch on the third day after batting the hosts out of the match , but they held on with three wickets in hand after losing two late in the day . Ikin had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers . Bradman took the second new ball and gave it to Miller , who refused to bowl , saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century . Lindwall ( 4 / 27 ) was then given the ball and promptly removed Ikin one run short of his century .

 At Sunderland , 11 , 12 August . The Australians ( 282 ) drew with Durham ( 73 / 5 ) . 
 In the absence of the resting Bradman , Hassett won the toss and elected to bat . Attendance was 17 @,@ 000 on the first day of this two @-@ day non @-@ first @-@ class match . Rain prevented any play on the second day . After a poor start that saw them fall to 22 / 3 , McCool ( 64 ) and Miller ( 55 ) made half @-@ centuries for the Australians . Many of the Australians made starts and six scores passed 20 , but none went on . <unk> Keith Jackson took 5 / 76 for the hosts . Five Australian bowlers each took one wicket and Jackson top @-@ scored with 23 before rain ended the match .

 At Canterbury , 21 , 23 August . The Australians ( 361 ) defeated Kent ( 51 and 124 ) by an innings and 186 runs . 
 Australia elected to bat first and Brown made 106 , while Bradman ( 65 ) and Harvey ( 60 ) both scored half @-@ centuries . Kent collapsed to the lowest score of the tour in the first innings , succumbing in only 23 overs . Johnston and Loxton both took 3 / 10 , and six local batsmen made ducks . Forced to follow on , half the Kent side were out for 45 in the second innings . Tony Pawson and Godfrey Evans added 71 , but the match , held in front of record crowds for the ground , ended inside two days , soon after Evans was run out . It took the Australians less than 56 overs to get 20 wickets . Lindwall took 4 / 37 in the second innings ; all his wickets were top @-@ order batsmen .

 After winning the toss , the Australians made all their runs on the first day , with centuries for Hassett ( 103 ) , Harvey ( 126 ) and Johnson ( 113 * ) and 99 for Hamence . The Australians put on 255 for the second wicket , through Hassett and Barnes , who was replaced by Harvey after retiring ill . The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries , and were keen to see Hamence do the same . The rest of the team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone , only to see him stumped for 99 , his highest score for the season . On the Monday , the second day , on a pitch that was taking spin , Somerset collapsed twice inside four hours and less than 82 overs in total . McCool took 4 / 21 and 4 / 23 , and Johnston also took eight , including 5 / 34 in the second innings . He took the last two wickets of the Somerset first innings as a spinner , and then had Harold Gimblett lbw with the second ball of the second innings as a fast @-@ medium bowler to take three wickets in four balls . 
 = = = v South of England = = = 
 At Hastings , 1 , 2 , 3 September . The Australians ( 522 / 7 declared ) drew with the South of England ( 298 ) . 
 The tourists elected to bat and after losing the openers early , Hassett top scored with 151 , his third consecutive century . He was supported by Bradman ( 143 ) and Harvey ( 110 ) , whose quick scoring enabled the Australians to declare with a large total . Hassett shared partnerships in excess of 150 with both Bradman and Harvey . Harvey 's century took only 90 minutes and Loxton hit 67 in 75 minutes on the second day . The second and third days were continually interrupted by rain , and Compton made 82 in the showers . Bradman gave his regular bowlers a light workload and Brown took 4 / 16 in 4 @.@ 1 overs to finish off the tail , the only time he bowled in first @-@ class matches on the entire tour .

 At Scarborough , 8 , 9 , 10 September . HDG Leveson @-@ Gower 's XI ( 177 and 75 / 2 ) drew with the Australians ( 489 / 8 declared ) . 
 This was the final match for Bradman in England , and the ground was crowded despite rain interruptions . It was Australia 's biggest challenge in the post @-@ Test tour matches . During the last Australian campaign in 1938 , this team was effectively a full @-@ strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play . Bradman then fielded a full @-@ strength team , with the only difference from the Fifth Test line @-@ up being the inclusion of Johnson at the expense of Ring . The host captain Walter Robins won the toss and decided to bat , but Lindwall took 6 / 59 in an innings that lasted into the second day , bowling four of his victims and taking five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs . Bradman and Barnes made 153 and 151 respectively , sharing a second @-@ wicket partnership of 225 after Morris was out for 62 . Loxton hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face , breaking his nose .

 At Edinburgh , 13 , 14 September . The Australians ( 236 ) defeated Scotland ( 85 and 111 ) by an innings and 40 runs . 
 The match against Scotland was a two @-@ day fixture that did not have first @-@ class status . Australia elected to bat and Morris top @-@ scored with 112 , and McCool made 52 , but all struggled against the leg @-@ spin of William Laidlaw , who took 5 / 51 .

Bradman allowed his non @-@ regular bowlers opportunities with the ball , and the wickets were shared , with nobody taking more than four . 
 = Hurricane Isis ( 1998 ) = 
 Hurricane Isis was the deadliest tropical cyclone and only hurricane to make landfall during the 1998 Pacific hurricane season . The ninth tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the season , Isis developed on September 1 from an interaction between a tropical wave and a large surface circulation to the southwest of Mexico . It moved northward , striking the extreme southeastern portion of the Baja California peninsula before attaining hurricane status in the Gulf of California . Isis made landfall at Topolobampo in the Mexican state of Sinaloa on September 3 , and quickly lost its low @-@ level circulation . The remnants persisted for several days before dissipating in the U.S. state of Idaho . 
 In Mexico , Isis destroyed over 700 houses and killed 14 people ; this is primarily due to its heavy rainfall which peaked at over 20 inches ( 500 mm ) in southern Baja California Sur . The rainfall caused widespread damage to roads and railways , stranding thousands of people . Moisture from the remnants of Isis extended into the southwestern United States , resulting in light rainfall , dozens of traffic accidents , and power outages to thousands of residents in San Diego County , California . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 14 , 1998 . It traveled westward , and on August 19 spawned the tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Bonnie . The wave continued westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea , and crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 25 . The wave decreased its forward speed while approaching a large low @-@ level circulation over southern Mexico . A broad area of disturbed weather formed in association with the wave and the low @-@ level circulation , and after persisting for several days developed a smaller low @-@ level circulation on August 29 about 575 miles ( 925 km ) south @-@ southeast of Cabo San Lucas . On August 31 , the two primary areas of convection were well @-@ removed from the center . By early on September 1 , despite a lack of convective organization , the low @-@ cloud circulation was sufficiently well @-@ defined that the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Ten @-@ E , or the tenth tropical depression of the season , about 350 miles ( 565 km ) south of Cabo San Lucas . In real time , the National Hurricane Center first upgraded the system 21 hours later . 
 The depression initially tracked slowly north @-@ northwestward and gradually strengthened . Late on September 1 it intensified into Tropical Storm Isis while located about 200 miles ( 320 km ) south of Cabo San Lucas . Upon becoming a tropical storm , the deep convection was not organized , causing one forecaster to describe Isis as a large monsoon @-@ like system . A mid @-@ level trough extending southward from the Arizona / California border caused the storm to accelerate northward . The storm quickly strengthened ; six hours after Isis became a tropical storm it reached winds of 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) . Very deep , symmetrical convection developed over the poorly defined center of circulation while banding features began to form , although ill @-@ defined outflow and land interaction with the Baja California Peninsula initially prevented further strengthening . At 1200 UTC on September 2 , Isis made landfall on extreme southeastern Baja California Sur as a strong tropical storm , and subsequently turned to the north @-@ northeast . 
 After entering the Gulf of California , an eye began to become apparent on visible satellite imagery , and it is estimated Isis attained hurricane status late on September 2 . Continuing northward , it struck Topolobampo in the state of Sinaloa early on September 3 as a minimal hurricane . Isis weakened to a tropical storm a few hours after landfall , and subsequent to turning to the north @-@ northwest the low @-@ level circulation dissipated over Sierra Madre Occidental . The remnants entered southern Arizona on September 4 and tracked around an upper @-@ level low . After entering Nevada on September 5 , the remnants of Isis passed into Oregon before dissipating in Idaho on September 8 .

 Coinciding with the National Hurricane Center 's first advisory on Isis , the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Dolores to Puerto Cortés along the Baja California Peninsula . This helped some of the residents get an early <unk> on September 2 , the warning was extended from Santa Rosalía to Punta Abreojos , while an additional tropical storm warning was issued from El Dorado to Guaymas . After Isis became a hurricane , officials issued a hurricane warning from Dolores to Punta San Gabriel on the Baja California Peninsula and from El Dorado to Bahía Kino on the mainland . 
 In Baja California Sur , 2 @,@ 500 residents were evacuated to emergency shelters . Officials closed the port at Mazatlán and recommended fisherman along the coast of the Gulf of California to remain at port . Officials set up 49 shelters on the mainland to provide evacuees with food , clothing and medical attention . The Mexican Army assisted residents in evacuation , and the Navy provided medical aid and assistance to boat owners . More than 24 @,@ 000 people were sheltered during the storm .

 Isis first affected Baja California Sur on September 2 as a tropical storm . Shortly after making landfall , a weather reporting station at San José del Cabo recorded sustained winds of 26 mph ( 42 km / h ) , and gusts reaching up to 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) . A station on the Islas Marías also reported sustained winds of 54 mph ( 87 km / h ) . The winds left widespread areas without power or telephone . The storm produced heavy rainfall in the southern portion of the peninsula , including a 24 ‑ hour total of 12 @.@ 99 inches ( 330 mm ) at Los Cabos and a peak rainfall total of 24 @.@ 02 inches ( 610 mm ) at Santiago . A married couple was killed after attempting to cross a flooded stream in Los Cabos . Initially , reports indicated a family was missing in La Paz , though they were later proven false . Flooding from the storm closed all roads to the north of Los Cabos and caused damage to the roads in the area . Mudslides from the rain buried at least 120 cars in the area . 
 Rainfall reached over 10 inches ( 250 mm ) in the coastal region of Jalisco , and lighter amounts of precipitation extended further to the southeast and northeast . One person was reported missing in Jalisco . The heaviest 24 ‑ hour rainfall total in the state of Sinaloa was 8 @.@ 66 inches ( 220 mm ) , whereas in Sonora a maximum of 4 @.@ 72 inches ( 120 mm ) of rain were recorded . Strong waves from the hurricane struck the Mexican mainland , with four people injured at Mazatlán when their boat washed onto rocks and was destroyed . Rainfall from the storm flooded 15 communities in and around Mazatlán , and the Army assisted residents in emergency evacuations . At Los Mochis , near the point where Isis made landfall , the hurricane resulted in the destruction of 300 homes , as well as in seven fatalities . Throughout the city , strong winds from the hurricane downed street posts , tree limbs , and power lines , with one person seriously injured from a downed power line . Additionally , the roof of a gas station collapsed from the winds . More than 1 @,@ 200 bus passengers in Sinaloa were stranded due to road closures from the hurricane , including the closure of the coastal highway in the southern portion of Sinaloa as it had been washed out due to floodwaters . Rainfall from the storm caused severe river flooding in some locations , and authorities advised those living along the Fuerte River to be prepared for a possible evacuation . The winds from Isis left about 120 @,@ 000 people in the municipality of Ahome without power . 
 Throughout Mexico , the passage of Hurricane Isis resulted in 14 deaths and the loss of 769 homes , with property damage estimates totaling over $ 5 million ( 1998 USD , 50 million 1998 MXN , $ 6 @.@ 3 million 2007 USD ) . According to a speech by President Ernesto Zedillo , Isis damaged the water systems in 173 localities ; it also damaged 154 primary schools and nine high schools , minor in most cases , causing most schools to be closed for around a week . A total of 730 miles ( 1175 km ) of railroad track was damaged by mudslides or flooding , with one bridge entirely destroyed and another four damaged .

 Thunderstorms from the remnants of Isis dropped more than two inches ( 50 mm ) of rainfall across southern Arizona , resulting in some flash flood warnings and flooding on roadways . The heaviest precipitation fell across the Santa Catalina and Rincon Mountains near Tucson , which saw precipitation amounts of up to three inches ( 75 mm ) . Otherwise , no flooding was reported in the Tucson area , and the Tucson International Airport reported only 1 @.@ 1 inches ( 28 mm ) as a result of the storm . 
 The moisture extended into southern California and produced moderate precipitation across the region . Bakersfield reported a one @-@ day rainfall record on September 4 with 0 @.@ 23 inches ( 5 @.@ 8 mm ) of precipitation , breaking the previous record of 0 @.@ 17 inches ( 4 @.@ 3 mm ) set in 1963 .

Agricultural losses , primarily from vintners and raisin growers , rose up to $ 5 million in damage ( 1998 USD , $ 6 @.@ 33 million 2007 USD ) , either directly due to rain or indirectly due to the additional steps to treat the increase in fungus activity on produce . Slick roads from the rain resulted in nearly 80 traffic accidents in San Diego County , ranging from fender benders to moderate injuries . Thunderstorms from the remnants of Isis damaged a San Diego Gas & Electric substation at Kearny Mesa , leaving 10 @,@ 000 customers without power ; the outage was short lived and completely restored within two hours .

 = Thomas Bewick = 
 Thomas Bewick ( c . 11 August 1753 – 8 November 1828 ) was an English engraver and natural history author . Early in his career he took on all kinds of work such as engraving cutlery , making the wood blocks for advertisements , and illustrating children 's books . Gradually he turned to illustrating , writing and publishing his own books , gaining an adult audience for the fine illustrations in A History of Quadrupeds . 
 His career began when he was apprenticed to engraver Ralph Beilby in Newcastle upon Tyne . He became a partner in the business and eventually took it over . Apprentices whom Bewick trained include John Anderson , Luke Clennell , and William Harvey , who in their turn became well known as painters and engravers . 
 Bewick is best known for his A History of British Birds , which is admired today mainly for its wood engravings , especially the small , sharply observed , and often humorous vignettes known as tail @-@ pieces ; the book was the forerunner of all modern field guides . He notably illustrated editions of Aesop 's Fables throughout his life . 
 He is credited with popularising a technical innovation in the printing of illustrations using wood . He adopted metal @-@ engraving tools to cut hard boxwood across the grain , producing printing blocks that could be integrated with metal type , but were much more durable than traditional woodcuts . The result was high quality illustration at a low price . 
 = = Life = = 
 Bewick was born at <unk> , a house in the village of Mickley , Northumberland , near Newcastle upon Tyne on 10 or 11 August 1753 , although his birthday was always celebrated on the 12th . His parents were tenant farmers : his father John had been married before his union with Jane , and was in his forties when Thomas , the eldest of eight , was born . John rented a small colliery at Mickley Bank , which employed perhaps six men . Bewick attended school in the nearby village of Ovingham . 
 Bewick did not flourish at schoolwork , but at a very early age showed a talent for drawing . He had no lessons in art . At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to Ralph Beilby , an engraver in Newcastle , where he learnt how to engrave on wood and metal , for example marking jewellery and cutlery with family names and coats of arms . In Beilby 's workshop Bewick engraved a series of diagrams on wood for Charles Hutton , illustrating a treatise on measurement . He seems thereafter to have devoted himself entirely to engraving on wood , and in 1775 he received a prize from the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts , Manufactures and Commerce for a wood engraving of the " Huntsman and the Old Hound " from Select Fables by the late Mr Gay , which he was illustrating . 
 In 1776 Bewick became a partner in Beilby 's workshop . The joint business prospered , becoming Newcastle 's leading engraving service with an enviable reputation for high quality work and good service . In September 1776 he went to London for eight months , finding the city rude , deceitful and cruel , and much disliking the unfairness of extreme wealth and poverty side by side . He returned to his beloved Newcastle as soon as he could , but his time in the capital gave him a wider reputation , business experience , and an awareness of new movements in art . 
 In 1786 , when he was financially secure , he married Isabella Elliott from Ovingham ; she had been a friend when they were children . They had four children , Robert , Jane , Isabella , and Elizabeth ; the daughters worked on their father 's memoir after his death . At that period in his life he was described by the Newcastle artist Thomas Sword Good as " a man of athletic make , nearly 6 feet high and proportionally stout . He possessed great personal courage and in his younger years was not slow to repay an insult with personal chastisement . On one occasion , being assaulted by two <unk> on returning from a visit to <unk> , he resolutely turned upon the aggressors , and as he said , ' paid them both well ' . " 
 Bewick was also noted as having a strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair treatment of animals . He objected to the docking of horses ' tails , the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears , and cruelty to dogs . Above all , he thought war utterly pointless . All these themes recur in his engravings , which echo Hogarth 's attention to moral themes . For example , he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs , back from the wars , and animals with a gallows in the background . 
 Bewick had at least 30 pupils who worked for him and Beilby as apprentices , the first of which was his younger brother John . Several gained distinction as engravers , including John Anderson , Luke Clennell , Charlton Nesbit , William Harvey , Robert Johnson , and his son and later partner Robert Elliot Bewick . 
 In 1790 the partners published their History of Quadrupeds in 1790 , intended for children but reaching an adult readership , and its success encouraged them to consider a more serious work of natural history . In preparation for this Bewick spent several years engraving the wood blocks for Land Birds , the first volume of A History of British Birds . Given his detailed knowledge of the birds of Northumberland , Bewick prepared the illustrations , so Beilby was given the task of assembling the text , which he struggled to do . Bewick ended up writing most of the text , which led to a dispute over authorship ; Bewick refused to have Beilby named as the author , and in the end only Bewick 's name appeared on the title page , along with a paragraph of explanation at the end of the preface . 
 It may be proper to observe , that while one of the editors of this work was engaged in preparing the Engravings , the compilation of the descriptions was undertaken by the other , subject , however , to the corrections of his friend , whose habits led him to a more intimate acquaintance with this branch of Natural History . – Land Birds , Preface . 
 The book was an immediate success when published – by Beilby and Bewick themselves – in 1797 . Bewick started work at once on the second volume , Water Birds , but the disagreement over authorship led to a final split with Beilby . Bewick was unable to control his feelings and resolve issues quietly , so the partnership ended , <unk> and expensively , leaving Bewick with his own workshop . Bewick had to pay £ 20 , equivalent to about £ 20 @,@ 400 as of 2011 , in lawyer 's fees , and more than £ 21 for Beilby 's share of the workshop equipment . 
 With the assistance of his apprentices Bewick brought out the second volume , Water Birds , in 1804 , as the sole author . He found the task of managing the printers continually troublesome , but the book met with as much success as the first volume . 
 In April 1827 , the American naturalist and bird painter John James Audubon came to Britain to find a suitable printer for his enormous Birds of America . Bewick , still lively at age 74 , showed him the woodcut he was working on , a dog afraid of tree stumps that seem in the dark to be devilish figures , and gave Audubon a copy of his Quadrupeds for his children . 
 Bewick was fond of the music of Northumberland , and of the Northumbrian <unk> in particular . He especially wanted to promote the Northumbrian <unk> , and to support the piper John Peacock , so he encouraged Peacock to teach pupils to become masters of this kind of music . One of these pupils was Thomas 's son , Robert , whose surviving manuscript tunebooks give a picture of a piper 's repertoire in the 1820s . 
 Bewick 's last wood engraving , Waiting for Death , was of an old bony workhorse , standing forlorn by a tree stump , which he had seen and sketched as an apprentice ; the work echoes William Hogarth 's last work , The <unk> , which shows the fallen artist by a broken column . He died after a few days ' illness on 8 November 1828 , at his home . He was buried in Ovingham churchyard , beside his wife Isabella , who had died two years earlier , and not far from his parents and his brother John .

 = = = Technique = = = 
 Bewick 's art is considered the pinnacle of his medium , now called wood engraving . This is due both to his skill and to the method , which unlike the wood cut technique of his predecessors , carves against the grain , in hard box wood , using fine tools normally favoured by metal engravers . 
 Boxwood cut across the end @-@ grain is hard enough for fine engraving , allowing greater detail than in normal woodcutting . This been the dominant method used since Bewick 's time . In addition , since a wood engraving is inked on the face , it requires only low pressure to print an image , so the blocks last for many thousands of prints , and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run . In contrast , a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves , the face being wiped clean of ink before printing , so much higher pressure is required , and images must be printed separately from the text , at far greater expense . 
 Bewick made use of his close observation of nature , his remarkable visual memory , and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings , which proved to be both a strength and a weakness . If properly printed and closely examined , his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues to the character of his natural subjects , with humour and feeling . This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys , not only black and white , as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture . But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers ; they needed to ink his blocks with just the right amount of ink , mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness , and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully , to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick . Not surprisingly , this made printing slow and expensive . It also created a problem for Bewick 's readers ; if they lacked his excellent eyesight , they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints , especially the miniature tail @-@ pieces . But the effect was transformative , and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century . The quality of Bewick 's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected : his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children . 
 Bewick ran his workshop collaboratively , developing the skills of his apprentices , so while he did not complete every task for every illustration himself , he was always closely involved , as John Rayner explains : 
 some blocks would be drawn by one brother and cut by the other , the rough work would be done by pupils , who would also , if they showed aptitude , draw and finish designs – on the same principle as the schools of Renaissance painters ; and we cannot ... be sure in all cases that the engravings ... are the work of Thomas Bewick from first to last , but he had a hand to a great extent in nearly all , and certainly had the last word in all of them . 
 = = = = Major works = = = = 
 Works using his wood engraving technique , for which he became well known , include the engravings for Oliver Goldsmith 's Traveller and The Deserted Village , for Thomas Parnell 's Hermit , and for William Somervile 's Chase . But " the best known of all Bewick 's prints " is said by The Bewick Society to be The Chillingham Bull , executed by Bewick on an exceptionally large woodblock for Marmaduke Tunstall , a gentleman who owned an estate at Wycliffe in the North Riding of Yorkshire . 
 = = = = Tail @-@ pieces = = = = 
 The <unk> or tale @-@ pieces , a Bewick speciality , are small engravings chosen to fill gaps such as those at the ends of the species articles in British Birds , each bird 's description beginning on a new page . The images are full of life and movement , often with a moral , sometimes with humour , always with sympathy and precise observation , so the images tell a tale as well as being at the tail ends of articles . For example , the runaway cart , at the end of " The Sparrow @-@ Hawk " , fills what would otherwise be a 5 cm ( 2 in ) high gap . Hugh Dixon explains : 
 The runaway cart is a wonderful mixture of action and danger . The boys have been playing in the cart and the horse has bolted ; perhaps the dog 's barking was the cause . The drawing of the wheel – an extraordinary depiction for its time – shows that the cart has gathered speed . One boy has already fallen and probably hurt himself . The others hang on shouting with fear . And why has it all happened ? The carter with his tankard in his hand runs too late from the inn . Has he been distracted by the shapely girl ? And is it an accident that the inn sign looks a little like a gallows ?

 The workshop of Beilby , Bewick , and son produced many ephemeral materials such as letterhead stationery , shop advertisement cards , and other business materials . Of these ephemeral productions , " bookplates have survived the best " . Bewick 's bookplates were illustrations made from engravings , containing the name or initials of the book 's owner . 
 = = = Aesop 's Fables = = = 
 The various editions of Aesop 's Fables illustrated by Bewick span almost his entire creative life . The first was created for the Newcastle bookseller Thomas Saint during his apprentice years , an edition of Robert Dodsley 's Select Fables published in 1776 . With his brother John he later contributed to a three @-@ volume edition for the same publisher in 1784 , reusing some pictures from the 1776 edition . 
 Bewick went on to produce a third edition of the fables . While convalescing from a dangerous illness in 1812 , he turned his attention to a long @-@ cherished venture , a large three @-@ volume edition of The Fables of Aesop and Others , eventually published in 1818 . The work is divided into three sections : the first has some of Dodsley 's fables prefaced by a short prose moral ; the second has " Fables with Reflections " , in which each story is followed by a prose and a verse moral and then a lengthy prose reflection ; the third , " Fables in Verse " , includes fables from other sources in poems by several unnamed authors . Engravings were initially designed on the wood by Bewick and then cut by his apprentices under close supervision , refined where necessary by himself . This edition used a method that Bewick had pioneered , " white @-@ line " engraving , a dark @-@ to @-@ light technique in which the lines to remain white are cut out of the woodblock . 
 = = = A General History of Quadrupeds = = = 
 A General History of Quadrupeds appeared in 1790 . It deals with 260 mammals from across the world , including animals from " <unk> " to " Zorilla " . It is particularly thorough on some of the domestic animals : the first entry describes the horse . Beilby and Bewick had difficulty deciding what to include , and especially on how to organise the entries . They had hoped to arrange the animals systematically , but they found that the rival systems of Linnaeus , Buffon and John Ray conflicted , and in Linnaeus 's case at least changed with every edition of his work . They decided to put useful animals first " which so materially contribute to the strength , the wealth , and the happiness of this kingdom " . 
 The book 's coverage is erratic , a direct result of the sources that Bewick consulted : his own knowledge of British animals , the available scholarly sources , combined with George Culley 's 1786 Observations on Livestock and the antique John Caius 's 1576 On English Dogs . Bewick had to hand the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman 's account of his visit to the Cape of Good Hope on Cook 's expedition of 1772 to 1776 , and animals from the Southern Cape figure largely in the book . It was an energetic muddle , but it was at once greeted with enthusiasm by the British public . They liked the combination of vigorous woodcuts , simple and accurate descriptions , and all kinds of exotic animals alongside things they knew . 
 = = = A History of British Birds = = = 
 A History of British Birds , Bewick 's great achievement and with which his name is inseparably associated , was published in two volumes : History and Description of Land Birds in 1797 and History and Description of Water Birds in 1804 , with a supplement in 1821 . The Birds is specifically British , but is the forerunner of all modern field guides . Bewick was helped by his intimate knowledge of the habits of animals acquired during his frequent excursions into the country . He also recounts information passed to him by acquaintances and local gentry , and that obtained in natural history works of his time , including those by Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White , as well as the translation of Buffon 's Histoire naturelle . 
 Many of the illustrations that have most frequently been reproduced in other books and as decorations are the small tailpieces that Bewick had placed at the bottoms of the pages of the original . The worlds depicted are so small that a magnifying glass is necessary to examine their detail ; each scene , as Adrian Searle writes , " is a small and often comic revelation " , each tiny image giving " enormous pleasure " ; Bewick " was as inventive as he was observant , as funny and bleak as he was exacting and faithful to the things he saw around him . " 
 Bewick 's biographer , Jenny Uglow , writes that 
 Bewick appears to have had a faultless sense of exactly what line was needed , and above all where to stop , as if there were no pause for analysis or reflection between the image in the mind and the hand on the wood . This skill , which has made later generations of engravers pause in awe , could be explained as an innate talent , the je @-@ ne @-@ sais @-@ quoi of " genius " . But it also came from the constant habit of drawing as a child , the painstaking learning of technique as an apprentice ... 
 Bewick sometimes used his fingerprint as a form of signature , ( accompanied by the words " Thomas Bewick his mark " ) , as well as engraving it in one of his tail @-@ pieces as if it had clouded the tiny image of a rustic scene with a cottage by mistake . Uglow notes one critic 's suggestion that Bewick may have meant we are looking at the scene through a playfully smudged window , as well as drawing our attention to Bewick , the maker . Adrian Searle , writing in The Guardian , describes the tiny work as " A visual equivalent to the sorts of authorial gags Laurence Sterne played in Tristram Shandy , it is a marvellous , timeless , magical joke " .
