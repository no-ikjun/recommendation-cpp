 In 2005 , the Russian Federation had one of the highest levels of psychiatric beds per capita in Europe at 113 @.@ 2 per 100 @,@ 000 population , or more than 161 @,@ 000 beds . In 2014 , Russia has 104 @.@ 8 beds per 100 @,@ 000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services . Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long @-@ term social care institutions ( internats ) wherein they remain indefinitely . The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries . Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999 , and their number amounted to 505 by 2013 . The internats provided places for approximately 125 @,@ 000 people in 2007 . In 2013 , Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146 @,@ 000 people , according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation . It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals . Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122 @,@ 091 or 85 @.@ 5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection ( internats ) per 100 @,@ 000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe 's list of the number of places in the institutions . Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in <unk> internats , her words point out to the need to increase the number of places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing <unk> — relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to <unk> internats . 
 At his press conference in 2008 , Semyon Gluzman said that the surplus in Ukraine of hospitals for inpatient treatment of the mentally ill was a relic of the totalitarian communist regime and that Ukraine did not have epidemic of schizophrenia but somehow Ukraine had about 90 large psychiatric hospitals including the Pavlov Hospital where beds in its children 's unit alone were more than in the whole of Great Britain . In Ukraine , public opinion did not contribute to the protection of citizens against possible recurrence of political abuse of psychiatry . There were no demonstrations and rallies in support of the mental health law . But there was a public campaign against developing the civilized law and against liberalizing the provision of psychiatric care in the country . The campaign was initiated and conducted by relatives of psychiatric patients . They wrote to newspapers , yelled in busy places and around them , behaved in the unbridled way in ministerial offices and corridors . Once Gluzman saw through a trolleybus window a group of 20 @-@ 30 people standing by a window of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine with red flags , portraits of Lenin and Stalin and the slogan coarsely written on the white cardboard : " Get the Gluzman psychiatry off Ukraine ! " Activists of the dissident movement far from the nostalgia for the past also participated in the actions against changes in the mental health system . But in general , it should be remembered that all these protest actions have been activated by nomenklatura psychiatrists . The whole Ukrainian psychiatric system actually consists of the two units : hospital for treatment of acute psychiatric conditions and <unk> @-@ hospice for helpless " chronic patients " unable to live on their own . And between hospital and <unk> @-@ hospice is desert . That is why about 40 percent of patients in any Ukrainian psychiatric hospital are so @-@ called social patients whose stay in the psychiatric hospital is not due to medical indications . A similar pattern is in internats . A significant part of their lifelong customers could have lived long enough in society despite their mental illnesses . They could have lived quite comfortably and safely for themselves and others in special dorms , nursing homes , " halfway houses " . Ukraine does not have anything like that . 
 In the Soviet times , mental hospitals were frequently created in former monasteries , barracks , and even concentration camps . Sofia <unk> , a human rights activist and psychiatrist , says she saw former convicts who have been living in a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home . <unk> has not touched many of the hospitals , and persons still die inside them . In 2013 , 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow . Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible : 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows , no bedside tables , often no partitions , not enough toilets . The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005 . Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of xenophobia . The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful , useless , incurable , and dangerous . The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists . 
 Soviet mentality has endured into the present day . For instance , in spite of the removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders , 62 @.@ 5 % of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness , and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior . The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools , child care centers , and other public institutions . The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab <unk> in his 2013 interview to <unk> says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder , he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true . The trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder was supported by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry , referred the proposal to <unk> actions , and stated that ideological , social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one . In 2014 , Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality , and he along with Alexei <unk> in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality . 
 In 1994 , there was organized a conference concerned with the theme of political abuse of psychiatry and attended by representatives from different former Soviet Republics — from Russia , Belarus , the Baltics , the Caucasus , and some of the Central Asian Republics . <unk> <unk> made a report on the situation within the Lithuanian Psychiatric Association , where discussion had been held but no resolution had been passed . Yuri Nuller talked over how in Russia the wind direction was gradually changing and the systematic political abuse of psychiatry was again being denied and degraded as an issue of " hyperdiagnosis " or " scientific disagreement . " It was particularly noteworthy that Tatyana Dmitrieva , the then Director of the Serbsky Institute , was a proponent of such belittlement . This was not so queer , because she was a close friend of the key architects of " political psychiatry . " 
 In the early 1990s , she spoke the required words of repentance for political abuse of psychiatry which had had unprecedented dimensions in the Soviet Union for discrediting , intimidation and suppression of the human rights movement carried out primarily in this institution . Her words were widely broadcast abroad but were published only in the St. Petersburg newspaper Chas Pik within the country . However , in her 2001 book <unk> <unk> i <unk> ( The Alliance of Law and Mercy ) , Dmitrieva wrote that there were no psychiatric abuses and certainly no more than in Western countries . Moreover , the book makes the charge that professor Vladimir Serbsky and other intellectuals were wrong not to cooperate with the police department in preventing revolution and <unk> and that the current generation is wrong to oppose the regime . In 2007 , Dmitrieva asserted that the practice of " punitive psychiatry " had been grossly exaggerated , while nothing wrong had been done by the Serbsky Institute . After that an official at the Serbsky Institute declared " patient " Vladimir Bukovsky , who was then going to run for the President of the Russian Federation , undoubtedly " psychopathic " . 
 While speaking of the Serbsky Center , Yuri Savenko alleges that " practically nothing has changed . They have no shame at the institute about their role with the Communists . They are the same people , and they do not want to apologize for all their actions in the past . " Attorney Karen <unk> agrees : " Serbsky is not an organ of medicine . It 's an organ of power . " According to human rights activist and former psychiatrist Sofia <unk> , the system of Soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed , the Serbsky Institute is standing where it did , the same people who worked in the Soviet system are working there . She says we have a situation like after the defeat of fascism in Germany , when fascism officially collapsed , but all governors of acres , judges and all people remained after the fascist regime . 
 In his article of 2002 , Alan A. Stone , who as a member of team had examined Pyotr Grigorenko and found him mentally healthy in 1979 , disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of psychiatry as a tool against pacific dissidence in the former USSR . He asserted that it was time for psychiatry in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR in the hope of discovering that Soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation . In Stone 's words , he believes that Snezhnevsky was wrongly condemned by critics . According to Stone , one of the first points the Soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of psychiatry make is that the revolution is the greatest good for the greatest number , the greatest piece of social justice , and the greatest beneficence imaginable in the twentieth century . In the Western view , the ethical compass of the Soviet psychiatrists begins to wander when they act in the service of this greatest beneficence . 
 According to St Petersburg psychiatrist Vladimir Pshizov , a disastrous factor for domestic psychiatry is that those who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way . Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public has been reduced to making a business of <unk> drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill . In Soviet times , all the heads of departments of psychiatry , all the directors of psychiatric research institutes , all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura , which they remained so far . The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped : for one to two years , he run errands as a resident , then joined the party and became a <unk> . His junior colleagues ( usually non @-@ partisan ones ) collected and processed material for his dissertation . Its review of literature , particularly in a research institute for psychiatry , was often written by patients , because only they knew foreign languages , and their party comrades were not up to it , the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language . 
 Robert van Voren also says Russian psychiatry is now being headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times . Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed . In reality , we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry that was in the late 1980s . Russian psychiatrists do not have access to specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry . Staff training has not changed , literature is inaccessible , the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists . Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid . The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow , and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult , but also it would be a waste of time , energy and resources , so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years . Instead , the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine , donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public , organized a publishing house , helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free , but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars , and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev . 
 Many of the current leaders of Russian psychiatry , especially those who were related to the establishment in Soviet period , have <unk> from their avowal read at the 1989 General Assembly of the WPA that Soviet psychiatry had been systematically abused for political purposes . Among such leaders who did so is Aleksandr Tiganov , a pupil of Snezhnevsky , full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences , the director of its Mental Health Research Center , and the chief psychiatrist of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation . In 2011 , when asked whether ill or healthy were those examined because of their disagreements with authority , Tiganov answered , " These people suffered from sluggish schizophrenia and were on the psychiatric registry . " According to Tiganov , it was rumored that Snezhnevsky took pity on dissenters and gave them a diagnosis required for placing in a special hospital to save them from a prison , but it is not true , he honestly did his medical duty . The same ideas are voiced in the 2014 interview by Anatoly Smulevich , a pupil of Snezhnevsky , full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences ; he says what was attributed to <unk> was that he recognized the healthy as the ill , it did not happen and is pure slander , it is completely ruled out for him to give a diagnosis to a healthy person . 
 In 2007 , Mikhail Vinogradov , one of the leading staff members of the Serbsky Center , strongly degraded the human rights movement of the Soviet era in every possible way and tried to convince that all political dissidents who had been to his institution were indeed mentally ill . In his opinion , " now it is clear that all of them are deeply affected people . " In 2012 , Vinogradov said the same , " Do you talk about human rights activists ? Most of them are just unhealthy people , I talked with them . As for the dissident General Grigorenko , I too saw him , kept him under observation , and noted oddities of his thinking . But he was eventually allowed to go abroad , as you know ... Who ? Bukovsky ? I talked with him , and he is a completely crazy character . But he too was allowed to go abroad ! You see , human rights activists are people who , due to their mental pathology , are unable to restrain themselves within the standards of society , and the West encourages their inability to do so . " In the same year , he offered to restore Soviet mental health law and said it " has never been used for political persecution . " Human rights activists who claim it did , in Vinogradov 's words , " are not very mentally healthy . " 
 Russian psychiatrist Fedor Kondratev not only denied accusations that he was ever personally engaged in Soviet abuses of psychiatry ; he stated publicly that the very conception of the existence of Soviet @-@ era " punitive psychiatry " was nothing more than : " the fantasy [ <unk> ] of the very same people who are now defending totalitarian sects . This is slander , which was [ previously ] used for anti @-@ Soviet ends , but is now being used for anti @-@ Russian ends . " He says that there were attempts to use of psychiatry for political purposes but there was no mass psychiatric terror , he calls allegations about the terror a propagandistic weapon of activists of the Cold War . As Alexander Podrabinek writes , psychiatrists of punitive conscription and namely Kondratev are relatively indifferent to the public 's indignation over illegal use of psychiatry both in Soviet times and now , they do not notice this public , allowing themselves to ignore any unprofessional opinion . In response to the article by Podrabinek , Kondratev instituted a suit against Podrabinek under Russian Civil Code Article 152 on protecting one 's honor , dignity and business reputation . According to Valery Krasnov and Isaak Gurovich , official representatives of psychiatry involved in its political abuse never acknowledged the <unk> of their diagnostics and actions . The absence of the acknowledgement and the absence of an analysis of made errors cast a shadow upon all psychiatrists in the USSR and , especially , in Russia . As Russian @-@ American historian Georgi <unk> writes , after the fall of the communist regime , no matter how some psychiatrists lean over backwards , foaming at the mouth to this day when stating that they were slandered , that they did not give dissidents diagnoses @-@ sentences , or that , at least , these cases were isolated and not at all related to their personal activities , no matter how the doctors , if one may call them so , try to rebut hundreds if not thousands of real facts , it is <unk> . 
 In 2004 , Savenko stated that the passed law on the state expert activity and the introduction of the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary @-@ based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination , which it had never been under Soviet rule . Formerly , the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts , but now the court only chooses an expert institution . The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution , and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years . The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was , at the same time , the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is the only one in the country and is located in her Center . No one had ever had such a monopoly . 
 According to Savenko , the Serbsky Center has long labored to legalize its monopolistic position of the Main expert institution of the country . The ambition and permissiveness — which , due to proximity to power , allow the Serbsky Center to get in touch over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline , although the judges themselves have already learned it — have turned out to be a considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions . Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties , then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report , and to legalize the state of affairs . Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients ' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes , cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts . 
 On 28 May 2009 , Yuri Savenko wrote to the then President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter , in which Savenko asked Medvedev to submit to the State Duma a draft law prepared by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations , which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization . The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped to such an extent that it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report , even such as the substantiation of its findings , and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report , but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise . According to the letter , courts , in violation of procedural rules , do not analyze the expert report , its coherence and consistency in all its parts , do not check experts ' findings for their accuracy , completeness , and objectivity . 
 On 15 June 2009 , the working group chaired by the Director of the Serbsky Center Tatyana Dmitrieva sent the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation a joint application whose purport was to declare appealing against the forensic expert reports of state expert institutions illegal and prohibit courts from receiving lawsuits filed to appeal against the reports . The reason put forward for the proposal was that the appeals against the expert reports were allegedly filed " without regard for the scope of the case " and that one must appeal against the expert report " only together with the sentence . " In other words , according to Yuri Savenko , all professional errors and omissions are presented as untouchable by virtue of the fact that they were infiltrated into the sentence . That is cynicism of administrative resources , cynicism of power , he says . 
 The draft of the application to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was considered in the paper " Current legal issues relevant to forensic @-@ psychiatric expert evaluation " by Elena <unk> and Sergei <unk> focusing on the <unk> of appealing against the expert report without regard for the scope of the evaluated case . While talking about appealing against " the reports " , the authors of the paper , according to lawyer Dmitry <unk> , mistakenly identify the reports with actions of the experts ( or an expert institution ) and justify the impossibility of the " parallel " examination and evaluation of the actions of the experts without regard for the scope of the evaluated case . Such a conclusion made by the authors appears clearly erroneous because abuse by the experts of rights and legitimate interests of citizens including trial participants , of course , may be a subject for a separate appeal . 
 According to the warning made in 2010 by Yuri Savenko at the same Congress , <unk> . Anatoly Smulevich , author of the monographs Problema <unk> ( The Problem of Paranoia ) ( 1972 ) and <unk> <unk> ( Continuous Sluggish Schizophrenia ) ( 1987 ) , which had contributed to the hyperdiagnosis of " sluggish schizophrenia " , again began to play the same role he played before . Recently , under his influence therapists began to widely use antidepressants and antipsychotics but often in inadequate cases and in inappropriate doses , without consulting psychiatrists . This situation has opened up a huge new market for pharmaceutical firms , with their unlimited capabilities , and the flow of the mentally ill to <unk> . Smulevich bases the diagnosis of continuous sluggish schizophrenia , in particular , on appearance and lifestyle and stresses that the forefront in the picture of negative changes is given to the contrast between retaining mental activity ( and sometimes quite high capacity for work ) and mannerism , <unk> of one 's appearance and entire lifestyle . 
 According to the commentary by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia on the 2007 text by Vladimir <unk> , a <unk> of Snezhnevsky 's school , there are sufficient patients with delusion of reformism in psychiatric inpatient facilities for involuntary treatment . In 2012 , delusion of reformism was mentioned as a symptom of mental disorder in Psychiatry . National Manual edited by Tatyana Dmitrieva , Valery Krasnov , Nikolai <unk> , Valentin <unk> , and Alexander Tiganov . In the same year , Vladimir <unk> in his paper reported that he diagnosed 4 @.@ 7 percent of 300 patients with delusion of reform . As Russian sociologist Alexander Tarasov notes , you will be treated in a hospital so that you and all your acquaintances get to learn forever that only such people as Anatoly <unk> or German <unk> can be occupied with reforming in our country ; and you are suffering from " syndrome of litigiousness " if in addition you wrote to the capital city complaints , which can be written only by a reviewing authority or lawyer . 
 According to Doctor of Legal Sciences Vladimir <unk> , regional differences in forensic psychiatric expert reports are striking . For example , in some regions of Russia , 8 or 9 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane ; in other regions up to 75 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane . In some regions less than 2 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics ; in other regions up to 80 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics . 
 In April 1995 , the State Duma considered the first draft of a law that would have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President , the Prime Minister , and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions . In 2002 , Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised about the use of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country . Obviously , one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter , she said , though is it worthwhile to substitute experts ' medical reports for elections ? In 2003 , the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by Alexander Podrabinek , author of the book Punitive Medicine , a 265 @-@ page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union . He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event of inappropriate behavior . Concerned about the problem , authorities ruled that the Russian Mental Health Law should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with parliamentary or judicial immunity . A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment . In 2011 , Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one 's marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms and that there are statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities .

 The song was played at a " secret show " performed by the band on October 28 , 2011 , where the band also performed other songs that are on the track listing of ¡ Uno ! : " Let Yourself Go " and " Carpe Diem " Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised the band 's performance while also writing , " Other new music included the blistering Ramones @-@ tinged ' Let Yourself Go ' ( ' Shut your mouth ' cause you 're talking too much and I don 't give a fuck anyway ' ) , the driving beat and sing @-@ along chorus of ' Carpe Diem , ' and the strut of ' Oh Love ' " . Green Day went into the studio to begin recording songs for a new album on February 14 , 2012 . Eventually , the band announced the release of albums ¡ Uno ! , ¡ Dos ! , and ¡ Tré ! . The official confirmation of the song came with the release of the track listing of their album ¡ Uno ! on June 26 , 2012 . 
 Later , on June 25 , 2012 , the band announced that they would be releasing " Oh Love " as the first single from ¡ Uno ! . Prior to its release , the band released a teaser @-@ sample of the song in a video uploaded to YouTube . The 16 @-@ second video consists of the cover art of ¡ Uno ! and an advertisement at the bottom with a snippet of the song played in the background , and at the end shows the head of Armstrong in the cover art , eating the advertisement . The song was released on July 16 , 2012 through Reprise Records and along with the release of the song , the band uploaded a video to YouTube which had its lyrics and the full song .

" Oh Love " was released as part of the " Green Day 03 " downloadable content pack for Rock Band 3 and Rock Band Blitz on September 25 , 2012 . 
 = = Theme and composition = = 
 Stylistically , " Oh Love " has been described as power pop . Its musical style is reminiscent of the band 's early albums Dookie ( 1994 ) and Nimrod ( 1997 ) . It is a " move away " from the band 's politically inspired releases like American Idiot ( 2004 ) and 21st Century Breakdown ( 2009 ) . Bassist Mike Dirnt described the musical style of " Oh Love " by stating , " We were just thinking about making a killer power @-@ pop record – dirtier , back to basics . We tapped into our version of Exile on Main Street " . Vocalist / guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong also talked about his desire to write a power pop song , stating , " What I really wanted to do was write real power @-@ pop kind of music that had that old Green Day energy , so the original Green Day sound became ¡ Uno ! " . 
 David Fricke of Rolling Stone compared the song to the genre of The Who 's Quadrophenia and the vocals of Armstrong in the start to those of John Lennon . He called the song a " tight , addicting bundle of pop @-@ hook class and crunchy @-@ punk fundamentals " . Sarah Maloy of Billboard elaborated that the guitar instrumentation is simple and the tune is similar to the band 's early releases .

 The band revealed the artwork of " Oh Love " on July 10 , 2012 , in a press release on their official website about the release of the song . The cover art of the song follows the style of those of ¡ Uno ! , ¡ Dos ! , and ¡ Tré ! . It features a traffic signal post on the right side with a heart on top followed by two crosses below . " Green Day " and " Oh Love " are written in capital letters at top left and bottom left respectively . " Green Day " is written in pale yellow while " Oh Love " is in white against the blue background , which shows contrast between light @-@ dark and light shades along with black in the corner . 
 The band also announced release of an EP of the song and also showed its artwork , which is similar with minor variations in color and images . It features a traffic signal post on the right side similar to the song with a cross instead of a heart on top followed by a heart @-@ shaped hand grenade and a couple kissing , the artwork for American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown , respectively , instead of two crosses below . " Green Day " , in blue , and " Oh Love " , in white , are written in capital letters on the left top and bottom respectively , against a striped red background with blackened corners .

 The music video is directed by Samuel Bayer , who also directed the band 's American Idiot videos . Lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong said of the video on MTV : " It 's very lustful " . The video shows the stereotypes of a rock star 's life . The video features Green Day playing the song in front of an audience of scantily clad women . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The song received positive responses from a number of critics . David Fricke of Rolling Stone assigned the track four out of five stars , deeming it " just a bright , strident vocal and crisply strummed guitar . But when Armstrong ’ s bandmates fall in around him , Green Day sound the way you originally loved ’ em , and refreshed : heavier and hardened from their time in the trenches but back in the garage , ready for rapture " . Scott Shetler of PopCrush also rated the song four out of five stars and compared it to the song " Jesus of Suburbia " from the album American Idiot , calling it " a much shorter and slightly more accessible version " of that song . He also added , " That ’ s good news for Green Day fans and for those who miss rock music on Top 40 radio " . However , the song did not receive an entirely positive response from NME , who stated , " That crunchy guitar riff , that meandering melody , that by @-@ the @-@ numbers solo – it all comes off rather ‘ meh ’ , rather safe , and rather middle @-@ ground to these ears " .

 Upon its release as the lead song , " Oh Love " debuted on multiple world charts . The song made its debut at number one on the US Rock Songs with 13 million audience impressions at 145 reporting stations .

 = 1949 Texas hurricane = 
 The 1949 Texas hurricane was an intense tropical cyclone of the 1949 Atlantic hurricane season . Forming in the Pacific Ocean on September 27 , the storm crossed into the Gulf of Mexico — one of only a handful of known storms to do so — and began to intensify . It ultimately peaked with winds corresponding to high @-@ end Category 2 status on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale and made landfall near Freeport , Texas , on the morning of October 4 . It rapidly weakened after moving inland and dissipated several days later . Damage from the storm was moderate , although the hurricane temporarily cut off the city of Galveston from the mainland . Rice crops suffered extensive damage , with losses estimated at up to $ 10 million ( 1949 USD , $ 99 @.@ 5 million 2016 USD ) . Two people died due to the hurricane . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 According to modern @-@ day analysis , a tropical depression developed in the Pacific Ocean , south of El Salvador , early on September 27 . It drifted northward across Central America and eastern Mexico before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen on September 30 . Weather reports had indicated low air pressures over the area for several days . It is relatively rare for a tropical cyclone to cross from the Pacific into the Atlantic , or vice versa , and this storm is among less than a dozen known to have officially done so . Only three other tropical cyclones have crossed from the eastern Pacific into the Gulf of Mexico . 
 The cyclone intensified into a tropical storm on October 1 and sped up slightly as it curved northwestward . A day later it became a hurricane . Subsequently , a period of rapid intensification took place , and as the cyclone approached the Texas coast on October 3 , it attained peak winds of 110 miles per hour ( 177 km / h ) , equivalent to upper @-@ end Category 2 — almost Category 3 — intensity . The storm moved ashore early the next day just east of Bay City with a barometric pressure estimated at 965 millibars ( 28 @.@ 50 inHg ) . The storm is one of a relatively few October hurricanes to either impact or make landfall in Texas . After significantly weakening , it passed directly over Houston ; the next storm to do so would be Hurricane Alicia in 1983 . 
 Upon moving inland , the hurricane quickly degraded into a tropical storm within six hours of making landfall . It turned northeastward as it continued through the central United States , weakening to a tropical depression by October 5 . It became extratropical the next day , yet persisted until October 7 , when it is believed to have dissipated near Sheboygan , Wisconsin . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Throughout 10 cities in Texas , 50 @,@ 000 sought shelter in advance of the hurricane . An estimated 28 @,@ 000 residents fled to shelters ; around 5 @,@ 000 stayed in the Houston City Auditorium . Tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued along coastal areas of Texas and Louisiana . Pioneer Airlines removed its aircraft from Houston , while small watercraft were kept safe in port . Schools in Corpus Christi closed by October 3 , as well as businesses in the threatened area . 
 The hurricane produced gusts of 135 mph ( 217 km / h ) just west of Freeport , accompanied by an air pressure of 28 @.@ 88 inches of mercury ( 978 hPa ) and tides of 11 @.@ 4 ft ( 3 @.@ 5 m ) above normal . Precipitation from the storm was heavy , peaking at 14 @.@ 5 in ( 370 mm ) at Goodrich . Rainfall extended eastward into Louisiana , amounting to 6 @.@ 81 in ( 173 mm ) at Shreveport , Louisiana . Urban areas sustained generally light damage . In Houston , the winds shattered some store windows and distributed debris . Galveston was temporarily cut off from the mainland during the hurricane when water surpassed the city 's seawall . The hurricane spawned a minor tornado which struck the community of Riceville , injuring on two children . Freeport reportedly suffered the worst damage , costing approximately $ 150 @,@ 000 . 
 A pier at Port Aransas was largely destroyed at a cost of $ 10 @,@ 000 . The hurricane caused extensive damage to rice , cotton , and vegetable crops in the region . An estimate several days after the storm placed the total quantity of rice damaged at 500 @,@ 000 bushels , totaling $ 10 million in monetary losses . However , <unk> ( 1949 ) reported that total damage from the storm was $ 6 @.@ 7 million . Following the storm , thousands of automobiles in six states were affected by widespread peeling and blistering paint . The blisters , usually concentrated on the hoods , fenders and tops of vehicles , contained a small amount of water , and peeling paint was also reported on one Shreveport home . Most of the cars damaged were parked outside , and sheltered automobiles were unaffected . Although total damage from the phenomenon may have reached thousands of dollars , experts were unable to identify its cause immediately following the storm . Two deaths were attributed to the storm : a resident of Port Neches who was electrocuted , and a young woman who drowned in Matagorda Bay . 
 = Language Movement = 
 The Language Movement ( Bengali : <unk> <unk> ্ <unk> Bhasha <unk> ) , was a political movement in former East Bengal ( today Bangladesh ) advocating the recognition of the Bengali language as an official language of the then @-@ Dominion of Pakistan in order to allow its use in government affairs , the continuation of its use as a medium of education , its use in media , currency and stamps , and to maintain its writing in the Bengali script . 
 When the Dominion of Pakistan was formed by the partition of India in 1947 , it was composed of various ethnic and linguistic groups , with the geographically non @-@ contiguous East Bengal province ( that was renamed in 1956 as East Pakistan ) having a mainly Bengali population . In 1948 , the Government of the Dominion of Pakistan ordained Urdu as the sole national language , sparking extensive protests among the Bengali @-@ speaking majority of East Bengal . Facing rising sectarian tensions and mass discontent with the new law , the government outlawed public meetings and rallies . The students of the University of Dhaka and other political activists defied the law and organised a protest on 21 February 1952 . The movement reached its climax when police killed student demonstrators on that day . The deaths provoked widespread civil unrest . After years of conflict , the central government relented and granted official status to the Bengali language in 1956 . In 1999 , UNESCO declared 21 February as International Mother Language Day , in tribute to the Language Movement and the ethno @-@ linguistic rights of people around the world . 
 The Language Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in East Bengal and later East Pakistan , and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements , including the 6 @-@ Point Movement and subsequently the Bangladesh Liberation War and Indo @-@ Pakistani War of 1971 . In Bangladesh , 21 February is observed as Language Movement Day , a national holiday . The Shaheed Minar monument was constructed near Dhaka Medical College in memory of the movement and its victims . 
 = = Background = = 
 The present nations of Pakistan and Bangladesh were part of undivided India during the British colonial rule . From the mid @-@ 19th century , the Urdu language had been promoted as the lingua franca of Indian Muslims by political and religious leaders , such as Sir Khwaja Salimullah , Sir Syed Ahmed Khan , Nawab <unk> @-@ ul @-@ Mulk and Maulvi Abdul Haq . Urdu is an Indo @-@ Aryan language of the Indo @-@ Iranian branch , belonging to the Indo @-@ European family of languages . It developed under Persian , Arabic and Turkic influence on <unk> ( last linguistic stage of the medieval Indian Aryan language Pali @-@ Prakrit ) in South Asia during the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire . With its Perso @-@ Arabic script , the language was considered a vital element of the Islamic culture for Indian Muslims ; Hindi and the Devanagari script were seen as fundamentals of Hindu culture . 
 While the use of Urdu grew common with Muslims in northern India , the Muslims of Bengal ( a province in the eastern part of British Indian sub @-@ continent ) primarily used the Bengali language . Bengali is an Eastern Indo @-@ Aryan language that arose from the eastern Middle Indic languages around 1000 CE and developed considerably during the Bengal Renaissance . As early as the late 19th century , social activists such as the Muslim feminist <unk> <unk> Hussain were choosing to write in Bengali to reach out to the people and develop it as a modern literary language . Supporters of Bengali opposed Urdu even before the partition of India , when delegates from Bengal rejected the idea of making Urdu the lingua franca of Muslim India in the 1937 Lucknow session of the Muslim League . The Muslim League was a British Indian political party that became the driving force behind the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state separate from British India . 
 = = Early stages of the movement = = 
 After the partition of India in 1947 , Bengali @-@ speaking people in East Bengal , the non @-@ contiguous eastern part of the Dominion of Pakistan , made up 44 million of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan 's 69 million people . The Dominion of Pakistan 's government , civil services , and military , however , were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan . In 1947 , a key resolution at a national education summit in Karachi advocated Urdu as the sole state language , and its exclusive use in the media and in schools . Opposition and protests immediately arose . Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of Abul <unk> , the secretary of <unk> <unk> , a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation . The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal . However , the Pakistan Public Service Commission removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects , as well as from currency notes and stamps . The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only state language of the Dominion of Pakistan . Public outrage spread , and many Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language . To promote their cause , Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka . 
 Leading Bengali scholars argued why only Urdu should not be the state language . The writer Abul Mansur Ahmed said if Urdu became the state language , the educated society of East Bengal would become ' illiterate ' and ' ineligible ' for government positions . The first <unk> Sangram Parishad ( National Language Action Committee ) , an organisation in favour of Bengali as a state language was formed towards the end of December 1947 . Professor Nurul Huq <unk> of the <unk> <unk> convened the committee . Later , Parliament member Shamsul Huq convened a new committee to push for Bengali as a state language . Assembly member <unk> Datta proposed legislation in the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan to allow members to speak in Bengali and authorise its use for official purposes . Datta 's proposal was supported by legislators Prem Hari Burman , <unk> Kumar Datta and <unk> Chandra <unk> of East Bengal , as well as the people from the region . Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan and the Muslim League denounced the proposal as an attempt to divide the Pakistani people , thus the legislation was defeated .

 Students of the University of Dhaka and other colleges of the city organised a general strike on 11 March 1948 to protest the omission of Bengali language from official use , including coins , stamps and recruitment tests for the navy . The movement restated the demand that Bengali be declared an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan . Political leaders such as Shamsul Huq , Shawkat Ali , Kazi <unk> <unk> , Oli Ahad , Abdul <unk> and others were arrested during the rallies . Rally leader Mohammad <unk> was hospitalised after attempting to snatch a rifle from a police officer . Student leaders , including Abdul Matin and Abdul Malek <unk> took part in the procession . 
 In the afternoon of 11 March , a meeting was held to protest police brutality and arrests . A group of students marching towards the chief minister Khawaja Nazimuddin 's house was stopped in front of the Dhaka High Court . The rally changed its direction and moved in the direction of the Secretariat building . Police attacked the procession injuring several students and leaders , including A. K. Fazlul Huq . Continuing strikes were observed the following four days . Under such circumstances , the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord with the student leaders agreeing to some terms and conditions , without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language . 
 In the height of civic unrest , Governor @-@ General of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah arrived in Dhaka on 19 March 1948 . On 21 March , at a civic reception at Racecourse Ground , he claimed that the language issue was designed by a " fifth column " to divide Pakistani Muslims . Jinnah further declared that " Urdu , and only Urdu " embodied the spirit of Muslim nations and would remain as the state language , labelling those who disagreed with his views as " Enemies of Pakistan " . Jinnah delivered a similar speech at Curzon Hall of the University of Dhaka on 24 March . At both meetings , Jinnah was interrupted by large segments of the audience . He later called a meeting of a state language committee of action , and overruled the contract that was signed by Khawaja Nazimuddin with the student leaders . Before Jinnah left Dhaka on 28 March , he delivered a speech on radio reasserting his " Urdu @-@ only " policy . 
 Shortly thereafter , the East Bengal Language Committee , presided by Maulana Akram Khan , was formed by the East Bengal government to prepare a report on the language problem . The Committee completed its report on 6 December 1950 , but it was not published until 1958 . The government suggested that Bengali be written in Arabic script , as a potential solution to the language conflict . 
 = = Events of 1952 = = 
 The Urdu @-@ Bengali controversy was reignited when Jinnah 's successor , governor @-@ general Khawaja Nazimuddin , staunchly defended the " Urdu @-@ only " policy in a speech on 27 January 1952 . On 31 January , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( All @-@ Party Central Language Action Committee ) was formed in a meeting at the Bar Library Hall of the University of Dhaka , chaired by Maulana Bhashani . The central government 's proposal of writing the Bengali language in Arabic script was vehemently opposed at the meeting . The action committee called for an all out protest on 21 February , including strikes and rallies . In an attempt to prevent the demonstration , the government imposed Section 144 in Dhaka , thereby banning any gathering . 
 = = = 21 February = = = 
 At nine o 'clock in the morning , students began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises in defiance of Section 144 . The university vice @-@ chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus . By a quarter past eleven , students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line . Police fired tear gas shells towards the gate to warn the students . A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police . The vice @-@ chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area . However , the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave . Enraged by the arrests , the students met around the East Bengal Legislative Assembly and blocked the legislators ' way , asking them to present their insistence at the assembly . When a group of students sought to storm into the building , police opened fire and killed a number of students , including Abdus Salam , Rafiq Uddin Ahmed , Abul Barkat and Abdul Jabbar . As the news of the killings spread , disorder erupted across the city . Shops , offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began . At the assembly , six legislators including <unk> Dhar , <unk> Das , <unk> Ahmed and <unk> Datta requested that chief minister Nurul Amin visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning . This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including Maulana Abdur Rashid <unk> , <unk> Ahmed , <unk> Ahmed <unk> and <unk> Ahmed . However , Nurul Amin refused the requests . 
 = = = 22 February = = = 
 Disorder spread across the province as large processions ignored section 144 and condemned the actions of the police . More than 30 @,@ 000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka . During the continued protests , police actions led to the death of four more people . This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations , including colleges , banks and the radio station , to boycott offices and join the procession . Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro @-@ government news agencies , the Jubilee Press and the Morning News . Police fired on a major <unk> , or mourning rally , as it was passing through <unk> Road . The shooting killed several people including activist <unk> Rahman and a nine @-@ year @-@ old boy named <unk> .

 Through the night of 23 February , students of Dhaka Medical College worked on the construction of a Shaheed <unk> , or Monument of Martyrs . Completed at dawn on 24 February , the monument had a handwritten note attached to it with the words " Shaheed <unk> " . Inaugurated by the father of the slain activist <unk> Rahman , the monument was destroyed on 26 February by police . On 25 February , industrial workers in the town of Narayanganj observed a general strike . A protest followed on 29 February whose participants faced severe police beating . 
 The government censored news reports and withheld exact casualty figures during the protests . Most pro @-@ government media held Hindus and communists responsible for encouraging the disorder and student unrest . The families of Abul Barkat and Rafiq Uddin Ahmed tried to charge the police with murder , but the charges were dismissed by the police . On 8 April government report on the incidents failed to show any particular justification for police firings on the students . When the constituent assembly reconvened on 14 April , proceedings were stalled by members of the Muslim League when legislators from East Bengal sought to raise the language issue .

 The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with support from the Awami Muslim League , decided to commemorate 21 February as <unk> <unk> ( Martyrs ' Day ) . On the first anniversary of the protests , people across East Bengal wore black badges in solidarity with the victims . Most offices , banks and educational institutions were closed to observe the occasion . Student groups made agreements with college and police officials to preserve law and order . More than 100 @,@ 000 people assembled at a public meeting held in Armanitola in Dhaka , where community leaders called for the immediate release of Maulana Bhashani and other political prisoners . However , West Pakistani politicians such as Fazlur Rahman aggravated sectional tensions by declaring that anyone who wanted Bengali to become an official language would be considered an " enemy of the state " . Bengali students and civilians disobeyed the restrictions to celebrate the anniversary of the protests . Demonstrations broke out on the night of 21 February 1954 with various halls of the University of Dhaka raising black flags in mourning . 
 = = = United Front in 1954 = = = 
 Political tensions came to a head as elections to the provincial assembly of East Bengal were held in 1954 . The ruling Muslim League denounced the opposition United Front coalition , which — led by A. K. Fazlul Huq and the Awami League — wanted greater provincial autonomy . Several United Front leaders and activists were arrested . A meeting of parliament 's Muslim League members , chaired by prime minister Muhammad Ali Bogra , resolved to give official recognition to Bengali . This decision was followed by a major wave of unrest as other ethnic groups sought recognition of other regional languages . Proponents of Urdu such as Maulvi Abdul Haq condemned any proposal to grant official status to Bengali . He led a rally of 100 @,@ 000 people to protest against the Muslim League 's decision . Consequently , the implementation failed and the United Front won a vast majority of seats in the legislative assembly , while the representation of the Muslim League was reduced to a historic low . 
 The United Front ministry ordered the creation of the Bangla Academy to promote , develop , and preserve Bengali language , literature , and heritage . However , the United Front rule was temporary , as Governor General Ghulam Muhammad cancelled the government and started Governor 's rule on 30 May 1954 @.@ the United Front again formed the ministry on 6 June 1955 after the governor 's regime ended . The Awami League did not participate in this ministry though . 
 Following the return of the United Front to power , the anniversary on 21 February 1956 was observed for the first time in a peaceful atmosphere . The Government supported a major project to construct a new Shaheed Minar . The session of the constituent assembly was stopped for five minutes to express condolence for the students slain in the police shootings . Major rallies were organised by Bengali leaders and all public offices and businesses remained closed . 
 = = = Constitution reform = = = 
 On 7 May 1954 , the constituent assembly resolved , with the Muslim League 's support , to grant official status to Bengali . Bengali was recognised as the second official language of Pakistan on 29 February 1956 , and article 214 ( 1 ) of the constitution of Pakistan was reworded to " The state language of Pakistan shall be Urdu and Bengali . " 
 However , the military government formed by Ayub Khan made attempts to re @-@ establish Urdu as the sole national language . On 6 January 1959 , the military regime issued an official statement and reinstated the official stance of supporting the 1956 constitution 's policy of two state languages . 
 = = = Independence of Bangladesh = = = 
 Although the question of official languages was settled by 1956 , the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of West Pakistan at the expense of East Pakistan . Despite forming the majority of the national population , the East Pakistani population continued to be under @-@ represented in the civil and military services , and received a minority of state funding and other government help . This was mainly due to lack of representative government in the fledgling state . Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew , and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League , which invoked the 6 @-@ point movement for greater provincial autonomy . One demand was that East Pakistan be called Bangladesh ( Land / Country of Bengal ) , which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Language Movement had a major cultural impact on Bengali society . It has inspired the development and celebration of the Bengali language , literature and culture . 21 February , celebrated as Language Movement Day or <unk> <unk> ( Martyrs ' Day ) , is a major national holiday in Bangladesh . A month @-@ long event called the Ekushey Book Fair is held every year to commemorate the movement . Ekushey <unk> , one of the highest civilian awards in Bangladesh , is awarded annually in memory of the sacrifices of the movement . Songs such as Abdul <unk> Choudhury 's Amar <unk> <unk> <unk> , set to music by Shaheed Altaf Mahmud , as well as plays , works of art and poetry played a considerable role in rousing the people 's emotions during the movement . Since the events of February 1952 , poems , songs , novels , plays , films , cartoons and paintings were created to capture the movement from varied point of views . Notable artistic depictions include the poems <unk> , Amar <unk> <unk> and February 1969 by <unk> Rahman , the film <unk> <unk> Neya by Zahir <unk> , the stage play <unk> by <unk> Chowdhury and the novels Ekushey February by <unk> and <unk> by Shawkat Osman . Bangladesh officially sent a proposal to UNESCO to declare 21 February as " International Mother Language Day " . The proposal was supported unanimously at the 30th General Conference of UNESCO held on 17 November 1999 . 
 Two years after the first monument was destroyed by the police , a new Shaheed Minar ( Monument of Martyrs ) was constructed in 1954 to commemorate the protesters who lost their lives . Work on a larger monument designed by the architect <unk> Rahman began in 1957 with the support of the United Front ministry . <unk> Rahman 's model consisted of a large complex in the yard of the Dhaka Medical College Hostel . The design included a half @-@ circular column symbolizing a mother with her martyred sons standing at the dais in the center of the monument . Although the imposition of martial law in 1958 interrupted the work , the monument was completed and inaugurated on 21 February 1963 by Abul Barkat 's mother , Hasina Begum . Pakistani forces demolished the monument during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 , but the Bangladeshi government reconstructed it in 1973 . 
 Outside East Bengal , movement for equal status of Bengali also took place in the Indian state of Assam . On May 19 , 1961 , 11 Bengalis were killed in Police firing in Silchar Railway Station , Assam , while demanding state recognition of Bengali language . Subsequently , Bengali was given co @-@ official status in the three Bengali @-@ majority districts of Assam . 
 = = Reaction in West Pakistan = = 
 Although the Language Movement is considered to have laid the foundations for ethnic nationalism in many of the Bengalis of East Bengal and later East Pakistan , it also heightened the cultural animosity between the authorities of the two wings of Pakistan . In the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan , the movement was seen as a sectional uprising against Pakistani national interests . The rejection of the " Urdu @-@ only " policy was seen as a contravention of the Perso @-@ Arabic culture of Muslims and the founding ideology of Pakistan , the two @-@ nation theory . Some of the most powerful politicians from the western wing of Pakistan considered Urdu a product of Indian Islamic culture , but saw Bengali as a part of " <unk> " Bengali culture . Most stood by the " Urdu only " policy because they believed that only a single language , one that was not indigenous to Pakistan , should serve as the national language . This kind of thinking also provoked considerable opposition in the western wing , wherein there existed several linguistic groups . As late as in 1967 , military dictator Ayub Khan said , " East Bengal is ... still under considerable Hindu culture and influence . " 
 The Awami Muslim League turned over to Bengali nationalism after the Movement , and shed the word " Muslim " from its name . The Language Movement inspired similar discontent in the western wing of Pakistan and provided momentum to ethnic nationalist parties . The political unrest in East Pakistan and rivalry between the central government and the United Front @-@ led provincial government was one of the main factors culminating in the 1958 military coup by Ayub Khan .

 Sierra Highway or El Camino Sierra is a road in Southern California , United States . El Camino Sierra refers to the full length of a trail formed in the 19th century , rebuilt as highways in the early 20th century , that ran from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe following parts of modern State Route 14 , U.S. Route 395 and State Route 89 . Two portions of this road are currently signed as Sierra Highway . The first is an old alignment of SR 14 / U.S. Route 6 from Los Angeles to Mojave . This road is also signed with the unusual designation of State Route 14U through the city of Santa Clarita . The second part signed as Sierra Highway is a portion of US 395 in Bishop . 
 Traversing the extremes of California , from the Mojave Desert to the Sierra Nevada , El Camino Sierra has been advertised to the world as a highway to showcase the natural beauty of California as far back as 1910 . Though most of Sierra Highway was bypassed in the early 1970s with freeways , the road is still well known . The portion through the San Gabriel Mountains is noted as the primary filming location for the film Duel . 
 = = Route description = = 
 El Camino Sierra connects Los Angeles with Lake Tahoe along the eastern edge of California , serving the counties of Los Angeles , Kern , Inyo , Mono , Alpine and El Dorado . The highway exists as a roadway now called Sierra Highway from Los Angeles to Mojave . North of Mojave , El Camino Sierra is better known by the numbered designations in current use . While traversing the state , the highway crosses several mountain passes . The highway crests the San Gabriel Mountains via Soledad Pass . While in the Sierra Nevada the highway crosses Sherwin Summit , Deadman Summit , Conway Summit , Devil 's Gate Pass , Monitor Pass and Luther Pass . 
 = = = Southern California = = = 
 Sierra Highway begins at Tunnel Station near the north limit of the City of Los Angeles , where it intersects with San Fernando Road . This junction was historically the intersection of U.S. Route 99 and U.S. Route 6 . It is located adjacent to the intersection of the replacement freeways , the Newhall Pass interchange of Interstate 5 and State Route 14 . 
 The highway serves as one of the main thoroughfares of Santa Clarita . Through the city , Route 14 was moved to a freeway alignment in 1971 ; however , the process to decommission the old alignment of Route 14 is not complete . As a result , this portion is signed California State Route 14U , the U signifying " un @-@ relinquished " . Formal specifications for Route 14U are not published on Caltrans logs , but the route 's existence is acknowledged in Caltrans ' bridge inventory logs . According to the City of Santa Clarita , Caltrans maintains Sierra Highway ( 14U ) from 500 feet north of Newhall Avenue to Whispering Leaves Drive . The remaining part of Sierra Highway through the City of Santa Clarita is maintained by the City and not part of the 14U designation . 
 Sierra Highway , modern Route 14 , and a main line of the Union Pacific Railroad all cross the San Gabriel Mountains , cresting the mountains at Soledad Pass ( elevation 3 @,@ 179 feet ( 969 m ) ) . The three transportation arteries use different paths up the mountains , separating at Santa Clarita and converging near Acton . Sierra Highway uses Mint Canyon , the railroad uses Soledad Canyon and the modern Route 14 is a hybrid route using the ridges and side canyons between the two older routes . These canyons are formed by the Santa Clara River and its tributaries . 
 Upon exiting the mountains , Sierra Highway enters the Antelope Valley and serves as one of the main streets of Palmdale , Lancaster , and Rosamond . The highway runs parallel to the modern Route 14 and the railroad , becoming a frontage road . Just shy of Mojave the freeway portion of Route 14 ends , while the frontage road becomes a dirt path and eventually terminates . From this point , the canonical route of Sierra Highway joins State Route 14 , passing through downtown Mojave . 
 = = = U.S. Route 395 and State Route 89 = = = 
 North of Mojave the alignments of State Routes 14 and 89 , and U.S. Route 395 have not significantly changed since first paved , and are called El Camino Sierra . Significant portions have been upgraded to a divided highway ; however , most of the upgrades used the same alignment as the old two lane road . The highway cuts across Red Rock Canyon State Park to follow a series of valleys along the crest of the Sierra Nevada . While traversing the Owens Valley , the Sierra Highway passes Mount Whitney , the highest point in the contiguous United States , 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) above the highway . As of 2009 , the only other signed section of Sierra Highway is a portion of U.S. 395 past the separation with U.S. 6 in Bishop . 
 U.S. 395 was rebuilt on a new alignment on the ascent to Sherwin Summit and around Crowley Lake . Unlike the highway relocation in southern California , the old alignments have been renamed , now called Lower Rock Creek Road , Old Sherwin Grade , and Crowley Creek Road ; not Sierra Highway . From here to Lake Tahoe , the highway crosses mountainous terrain inside the Sierra Nevada , giving the highway its name . While in the Sierra Nevada , the road passes by attractions such as Mammoth Mountain , Yosemite National Park and Mono Lake . El Camino Sierra separates from U.S. 395 , just prior to the Nevada state line at Topaz Lake , following SR 89 . This is the only portion of the route not used year @-@ round , as Caltrans closes Route 89 over Monitor Pass during winter months . Motorists destined for Lake Tahoe during the winter closures can continue along US 395 into Nevada , and return to California via Nevada State Route 88 or Nevada State Route 207 .

 The first recorded journey along what would become El Camino Sierra was by Jedediah Smith in 1826 . The trail was in common use by prospectors passing through the area because of the California Gold Rush and Comstock Lode . While still mostly a dirt road , several people began promoting El Camino Sierra as a scenic route . In 1910 , the Los Angeles Times announced that Governor Gillet had announced funding to construct a new road to connect El Camino Real with Yosemite National Park . When finished , a new " wonderful circuit " route would be complete and El Camino Sierra would become " one of the most beautiful scenic routes in the world . " In 1912 , the Southern Pacific Railroad published an article called " Two Mules and a Motorist " in which the author 's trip down El Camino Sierra was detailed , promoting the trail as a scenic side trip , via pack mules , from its rail lines . In 1915 , the California Teachers Association distributed a promotional book to the annual convention of the National Education Association . This book contained an article that sung the praises of this " soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ world @-@ famous highway " called El Camino Sierra . While noting that it was still mostly an unimproved trail , the article assured the readers that county and state officials were working frantically to upgrade the route and , with the aid of convict labor , this would soon be a " boulevard the entire distance from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe . " The article concluded by stating El Camino Sierra was " a highway with a hundred by @-@ ways , each by @-@ way with a hundred wonders " . The article also implored the state legislature to extend El Camino Sierra to Truckee , Quincy and Susanville using a route similar to modern State Route 89 , SR 70 returning to US 395 . 
 By 1918 , El Camino Sierra had been included in the Blue Book , an early road atlas of the United States . The Los Angeles Times declared El Camino Sierra complete on Feb 19 , 1931 , announcing that the portion from Mojave to Owens Valley was now paved , and would be dedicated the following Sunday . 
 = = = Sierra Highway = = = 
 During the 1930s , two U.S. highways , both formed in 1926 , were extended into California using El Camino Sierra . The southern terminus of U.S. 395 was extended from Spokane , Washington to San Diego , using El Camino Sierra from near what is now Topaz Lake to Inyokern , by 1935 . By 1937 , U.S. Route 6 was extended from Colorado , mostly along the Midland Trail , to Long Beach using El Camino Sierra south of Bishop . As part of the 1964 state highway renumbering US 6 was truncated at Bishop , and the route from the separation with US 395 to I @-@ 5 was renumbered SR 14 . 
 Though during the 1970s most of Sierra Highway was bypassed by freeways and expressways , the old two @-@ lane road remained a famous roadway . In 1971 , Steven Spielberg made his first feature @-@ length film , Duel , along Sierra Highway , near Acton . The film is about an unseen truck driver who stalks and attempts to kill an innocent motorist trapped in the truck 's game . It prominently shows the desert portions of Sierra Highway . With Duel 's status , one of the trucks used in the film is still on the road and in the process of being restored . The current owner has driven the truck along Sierra Highway for nostalgia , enjoying the terrified looks he receives from passing motorists who recognize it . Other movies have since been filmed in the vicinity , including scenes in The Terminator .

 Anachronox is a third @-@ person role @-@ playing video game produced by Tom Hall and the Dallas Ion Storm games studio . It was released worldwide in June 2001 for Microsoft Windows . The game is centered on Sylvester " Sly Boots " <unk> , a down @-@ and @-@ out private investigator who looks for work in the slums of Anachronox , a once @-@ abandoned planet near the galaxy 's jumpgate hub . He travels to other planets , amasses an unlikely group of friends , and unravels a mystery that threatens the fate of the universe . The game 's science fiction story was influenced by cyberpunk , film noir , and unconventional humor . The story features a theme of working through the troubles of one 's past , and ends with a major cliffhanger . 
 The gameplay for Anachronox is turn @-@ based ; the player controls a party of up to three characters as they explore a 3D environment of futuristic cities , space vessels , and outdoor areas . Inspirations for the game include older role @-@ playing video games such as Chrono Trigger and the Final Fantasy series , animator Chuck Jones and the novel Ender 's Game . The game was built with a heavily modified version of the Quake II engine , rewritten chiefly to allow a wider color palette , emotive animations and facial expressions , and better lighting , particle , and camera effects . 
 The development of Anachronox was long and difficult , originally planned for a third @-@ quarter 1998 release . Tom Hall planned to create a sequel with the copious content removed during production . Despite critics enjoying the game and awarding it high marks for its design and story , Ion Storm closed its Dallas offices one month after the game 's release . In 2002 , Anachronox cinematic director Jake Hughes spliced together gameplay footage and cutscenes to create a feature @-@ length , award @-@ winning machinima film . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Anachronox is a turn @-@ based role @-@ playing game similar in nature to many Japanese role @-@ playing video games like Final Fantasy . The player controls a party of up to four characters as they explore a 3D environment ( colloquially known as a " field map " ) of futuristic cities , space vessels , and outdoor areas . Players can swap for new party members , talk to non @-@ player characters , and collect and shop for equipment and items . When players near an interactive character or item , a floating arrow @-@ shaped electronic device called the LifeCursor appears , which lets the player click on the person or item . After a certain point in the story , players can travel by shuttle to other planets , triggering cutscenes of the shuttle trips . Each playable character has a unique skill , such as lockpicking , which may be used to solve puzzles . Some sequences involve minigames , such as an unnamed mission in which the player pilots a fighter spaceship to destroy enemies with lasers . Certain field maps also feature simple two @-@ dimensional minigames , including the original games Ox and <unk> . The protagonist Boots also possesses a camera , which the player can use to take screenshots for their own enjoyment or as part of quest objectives . 
 Enemy encounters trigger a combat mode . As in Chrono Trigger , enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party and thus are not random . Similar to Final Fantasy 's Active Time Battle , each character has a meter that gradually fills with time . When the meter is full , characters can physically attack enemies , use MysTech magic , unleash <unk> attacks , use items , move to a different position , or use a nearby object to attack , if present . For playable characters and computer @-@ controlled enemies , each attack has their number of hit points ( a numerically based life bar ) get reduced , which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags . Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron @-@ <unk> <unk> ( NRG ) , a separate energy reserve displayed beneath a character 's life bar . NRG is replenished through certain items . Use of BattleSkills require Bouge , a third bar beneath NRG that automatically fills with time ; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is . Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills . When a playable character loses all hit points , he or she faints . If all the player 's characters fall in battle , the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game . Winning battles earns experience points and raises characters ' levels , granting them improved statistics . These statistics can be viewed through the status screen , which displays important character information and current quests . Unlike many other RPGs , Anachronox displays a character 's attributes with qualitative descriptors ( such as Poor and Excellent ) instead of integers . 
 = = = MysTech = = = 
 The Mysterium Tech ( or MysTech ) system allows players to use in @-@ game objects collectively known as MysTech , and create new MysTech by using a configuration screen accessed through Elementor Host items . MysTech cannot be used until they are awakened after a certain story event . Eight basic colors of MysTech exist , representing different elements ; for example , green represents poison . Players can use MysTech to inflict damage upon enemies , plague them with certain status effects ( such as freezing them in place ) , or heal party members . Casting status effect @-@ MysTech on party members will cure them if afflicted by enemy status spells . MysTech slabs and Elementor Hosts can be found as treasure in the game world or bought from shops . To create MysTech , players place colored bugs ( found on small hills in several game locations ) in empty slots on an Elementor Host . The color of bugs placed in the function slot determines the color of MysTech , while other slots modify the power and / or range of the spell . Players can add special bugs known as Cobalt Crawlers to make a spell target all enemies instead of one ; a Host filled with eight Crawlers unlocks a secret spell . The effect of bugs can be amplified by feeding them petals from <unk> , which can be found scattered throughout the world of Anachronox . Special types of Hosts with two or three different functions allow players to pick which MysTech function to use in battle .

 The game takes place on Anachronox ( a portmanteau of anachronism and noxious , meaning " poison from the past " ) , a small planet floating inside a huge artificial sphere known as Sender One . <unk> of futuristic cities exist on artificial tectonic plates , which constantly shift to connect different parts of the planet . Inhabitants believe that diseased aliens were quarantined there eons ago , resulting in the name Anachronox . Northern Anachronox is clean and upscale , while southern Anachronox is crime @-@ ridden and run @-@ down . Humanity travels to different planets from Sender One , which had been the center of a transportation system for a race of non @-@ humanoids enabling faster @-@ than @-@ light travel . Inbound and outbound traffic stops at Sender Station , an orbiting construct above Sender One with hotels and a red light district . Civilizations conduct business using currency like the one @-@ dollar coin known as a " <unk> " , while several people collect MysTech — shards of rock with markings , believed to be dormant weapons or art pieces created by an extinct alien race . MysTech were first found three @-@ hundred years ago , and are poorly understood , though avidly collected . 
 Other planets in Sender One include Sunder , Hephaestus , Democratus , and Limbus . The galaxy 's scientific community is headquartered on the temperate planet of Sunder , and people are only permitted to go there if they are sufficiently intelligent . Hephaestus is an important religious center . A mostly volcanic planet , Hephaestus hosts a town and temple complex of monks who study MysTech . Democratus is climatically similar to Earth , with regions of desert , snow , forest , and prairie . Several populations of different sentient species exist on the surface , but the planet is ruled by a race of tall , thin humanoids with large <unk> who dwell on a large mechanical ring constructed around the planet . This race is obsessed with the ideal of democracy , and though they possess incredible scientific and engineering knowledge , they are constantly bogged down by their own ineptitude and the frailties of the democratic process . Limbus is known as the " planet of death " , as voyagers never return ; its surface is arid and rocky , with sparse vegetation . A planet mentioned but not seen in the game is <unk> , home to superheroes and villains . Most of <unk> 's human population has fled , tired of being constantly abducted and saved by warring superpeople .

 The protagonist of Anachronox is Sylvester " Sly Boots " <unk> , a human and former private detective on Anachronox . Twenty @-@ nine years old and described as " bold , brash , and overconfident " , Boots has gotten himself into trouble and now runs his agency out of rented storage space above a seedy bar . His only friends are PAL @-@ 18 , his spirited , sarcastic robot assistant since childhood , and Fatima Doohan , his secretary . Fatima was fatally injured and digitized by Boots onto a PDA @-@ analogue " LifeCursor " , where she bitterly lives to render assistance . Several allies join Boots over the course of the game ; first is 71 @-@ year @-@ old Grumpos <unk> , a " scholar , outdoorsman , eccentric recluse , and renaissance man " — and a very grumpy person . A former curator of the MysTech museum on Anachronox , Grumpos devotes his life to studying the artifacts . Dr. Rho Bowman joins the party on Sunder ; she is a brilliant scientist who 's been branded a heretic after publication of her book , MysTech Awake ! The team then gains support from Democratus , an eccentric planet boasting a planetary ring and brilliant technology . Said technology includes having the planet shrink to human height to be part of the team . Two further allies are the femme fatale Stiletto Anyway — a 25 @-@ year @-@ old former companion of Boots known for being stealthy and aloof — and Paco " El <unk> " Estrella , a washed up superhero who 's turned to alcoholism after his comic book series was canceled . Their foes include Detta , a heavyset crime boss / kingpin on planet Anachronox , and several other monsters and shady characters .

 Sly Boots lives in a cheap apartment above Rowdy 's , a bar in the seedy " Bricks " section of South Anachronox . Grumpos <unk> commissions Boots to find a piece of MysTech , but Detta accosts them and steals it . Grumpos , Boots , and robot assistant PAL @-@ 18 then seek out Dr. Rho Bowman , an expert on MysTech , at an institute for troublesome scientists on Sunder . She undertakes an experiment to activate MysTech , apparently causing the destruction of Sunder . Rho and the others escape the planet on a shuttle , and drift in space for seventeen days until they are brought on board a habitat ring around the planet Democratus . Rho discovers that all MysTech is now active , and can grant powers and spells . Boots pilots a fighter ship to save Democratus from insectoid invaders known as the Virulent Hive . The heroes return to Sender Station 's Lounge of Commerce ; Democratus joins the party , the High Council having shrunken the planet to human height . While searching for equipment , Boots earns money as an erotic dancer and encounters Stiletto Anyway , an old flame who 's become an assassin and plots revenge against Detta . Rho explains that the universe operates on the big bounce principle ; a universe that forms with a big bang will eventually suffer a big crunch , giving rise to a new big bang . She explains that Sunder was destroyed by an injection of matter from the previous universe , which will hasten the current universe 's big crunch . If enough matter is switched between universes , the previous one can escape a big crunch and the current one will cease to exist . 
 The team heads to Hephaestus , transformed to a tourist destination now that MysTech is active . They realize MysTech functions can be customized through the use of small , colored bugs and a MysTech host . Sly gains audience with the Grand Mysterium , who tells him that in the next universe , species known as " Chaos " and " Order " fought a bitter war . Order enslaved Chaos in the current universe , but Chaos wishes to escape to the previous universe to prevent future ones from existing and thus eradicate Order . The Mysterium tells Sly he must find and seal off the gate to the previous universe , and to journey to Limbus . The team is captured en route by comic supervillain <unk> ; Boots meets former superhero Paco in his prison . <unk> flushes them into empty space ; the High Council of Democratus restores the planet to its original size to save them . 
 Scenes of reflection reveal the past on Anachronox . Stiletto had been Sly 's young assistant at his upscale agency ; he was in love with her , but Fatima was in love with him . Detta abducted Stiletto , spurring Sly 's search . Her love unrequited , Fatima went into his office one night to leave a note of resignation . Sly burst in with news of Stiletto 's location , and he and Fatima pursued Detta across Anachronox by flying car . Sly lost control , wrecking it and accidentally killing Fatima . Suffering from major depression , Sly ran up debts with Detta to pay for Fatima 's revival inside the LifeCursor . 
 The team regather at Democratus and journey to Limbus , where they meet creatures of the same race as the Grand Mysterium . They repel invaders called the " Dark Servants " from an orbital portal . The leader of Limbus explains that though Chaos is enslaved in the current universe , the Dark Servants ( who originate from the current universe ) are trying to free them and have found a way into the previous universe , where they initiated the destruction of Sunder . MysTech is a gift from the forces of Order to help the current universe 's inhabitants fight Chaos . The team return to Anachronox to find Rowdy , a disguised citizen of Limbus who has been searching for the gate to the previous universe . Rowdy notes that they must destroy the key to the gate , now in the possession of Detta . The team infiltrate his fortress , kill him , and prepare to destroy the key at the gate itself — the fountain spiral of Anachronox . Grumpos seizes it , revealing himself to be a Dark Servant ; he escapes with the agents of Chaos into the previous universe . Sly and the others prepare to follow them and save the universe ; the game ends as they approach the gate .

 Ion Storm announced Anachronox in April 1997 , and planned for a third @-@ quarter 1998 release . Tom Hall , veteran designer and one of the founders of Ion Storm , helmed the project and originated most of its story and design . Other founding members of the team were Todd Porter ( producer ) , Jake Hughes ( associate producer and director of cinematics ) , Ben Herrera ( artist ) , Brian <unk> ( programmer ) , and David Namaksy ( lead mapper ) . <unk> Larry Herring was hired after being mentored by John Romero and submitting a custom Doom 2 map to Tom Hall . Hall first conceived Anachronox in his bathroom , prompting him to install a whiteboard and sound @-@ recorder in his shower , as well as several <unk> around his house for future ideas ; he had conceived the character Sly Boots years earlier in college . He wrote a 460 @-@ page design document ( completed in May 1997 ) outlining the universe of Anachronox , beyond the game 's scope ; other game design documents of the period , he noted , were usually only 125 pages in size . He then condensed the story , leaving a third beyond the scheduled game . The game 's design phase lasted three months . Hall made plans for two expansion packs from the outset of development , owing to the huge story . Developers told Next Generation Magazine the story would be " <unk> " and feature immense environments . Hall noted in mid @-@ 1997 , " Not since Keen has a universe been so clear in my head . " 
 Tom Hall announced that <unk> would feature a " turbulent story with a roller coaster of emotion " , and promised it would bring personality and humor to the role @-@ playing genre . Hall aimed to make an emotionally gripping , cinematic experience from the beginning : " I want this game to answer the question , ' Can a computer make you cry ? ' I want to make the characters so warm and friendly and lovable and identifiable ... I want to start them off in fun situations , but as the game goes on , I want the atmosphere to get darker and darker . Friends betray the lead character , other friends die , and you will feel some of what they feel because you have been with these people for 50 hours , and in a sense , lived part of their lives with them . " Hall remarked that the characters were facets of his childhood . He later compared the name Anachronox ( meaning poison from the past ) and the internal struggles of each character , caused by turbulent events in their pasts and " psychic poison . " Hall aimed to feature high @-@ quality direction and camera @-@ work in Anachronox , reminiscent of epic cinematic themes in role @-@ playing video games like the Final Fantasy franchise . Hall enlisted producer Jake Hughes to direct cut scenes ; Hughes had previously worked on several short independent films . Developers used real @-@ time game cutscenes instead of live @-@ action cinematics to avoid " [ taking ] players out of the game . " Hall remarked , " All these games switch to cutscenes that look five hundred times better than the game . The secret is not to let the cutscenes kick the game 's ass . " 
 Tom Hall chose the Quake engine for Anachronox ; its developer John Carmack took interest in its use for a role @-@ playing game . Ion Storm would soon switch to the id Tech 2 engine , necessitating a transition from December 1997 to March 1998 . The team would implement engine support for 32 @-@ bit color , particle systems , a spline @-@ based camera <unk> , facial deformations , and lip @-@ synching . Facial deformation involved moving the vertices of a character 's face , thereby creating emotional expressions and body language . Developers built the first models in Lightwave ; the main characters had polygon counts of 500 @-@ 700 . By the end of 1997 , Hall had scripted interaction with 130 non @-@ player characters for 160 planned locations . Hall cited Chrono Trigger as a strong influence ; <unk> drew parallels with the Final Fantasy series and Ultima III . As in Chrono Trigger , battles were scripted and not caused by random , unavoidable encounters . Hall explained , " if there 's a dragon guarding a door , I want the chance to say , ' <unk> , look at the time , gotta run ' , not , ' think I 'll check this door . ( * <unk> * ) Dragon ? Where the hell was that ? ! ? ' " The team expanded the Final Fantasy @-@ style combat by allowing actions to be queued in advance . Hall listed some of his inspirations for Anachronox in mid @-@ 2000 : " In movies , some inspirational people are Spielberg , Hitchcock , George Roy Hill , Rob Reiner , and now Sam Mendes . Also a big fan of Chuck Jones , who directed Warner Brothers cartoons . Novels : Gateway , Ender 's Game , Snow Crash , Hitchhiker 's , so many more . Games : Chrono Trigger , Final Fantasy , LucasArts adventures ( Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer rock ) , Ape Escape ( buy it now ) , Mario , Ultima III , Wizardry I , oh , I 'm sure I 'm forgetting some ! " Hall also drew dramatic inspiration from a scene in Chrono Trigger in which the characters discuss the theme of regret around a campfire . 
 = = = Programming and design = = = 
 As production continued , Tom Hall dubbed the game 's scripting language " APE " ( Anachronox Programming Language ) . Hall explained , " I call it my new Apple II because it 's so much fun to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it . It 's sort of if you <unk> together C , Basic and Java in a way — for programming people it 's sort of Windows based . It began as a defined dialogue window , but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture . So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces , and you have things that initialize data to the window , things that constantly update the window , and things that happen after the window , in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing . " Hall wrote and coded the mini @-@ game <unk> for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment 's simplicity . Other tools developed for the game were <unk> ( a battle editor ) , ION Radiant ( for level design , based on QERadiant ) , <unk> ( for item and character placement ) , and Planet ( a spline @-@ based camera system coded by Joey Liaw ) . Ion Storm worked with <unk> developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant , later adapted to ION Radiant . Hall lauded Planet : " you can control entities on paths , trigger events , manipulate particles , and do just about anything you please . One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it . " Hall aimed to provide several end @-@ user modification tools , such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements . Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue , voice @-@ acting , and camera work . Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool . 
 Developers tasked both art and map design personnel with creating levels , ensuring visual quality . Hall implemented a " grow as you play " philosophy , choosing to show certain features and statistics ( like " Beat " or the use of MysTech ) only after the player enabled their use . Developers sought to make the game accessible to expert and casual players through two statistic displays — numerical or qualitative ( using categories such as " very good " or " bad " ) . Hall disparaged complicated number systems found in other games : " One of the things I hate about RPGs is , you 've got , like , ' here 's this thing and here 's that thing ' and it 's like ' this is 52 and that 's 53 ' I mean , what 's the difference ? It 's like , OK it 's ' a point , ' and the formula will come up to be like ' two points ' and like , sure , that 's going to make a difference . So now I have to hit the guy three times ... " Hall also sought to ensure players knew their next goal , and invented the character of Fatima Doohan to keep track of missions . Fatima 's name is a pun born from the phrase , " What am I doing ? " Hall named her after the experience of loading an old saved game in an RPG and having forgotten what comes next in the current quest or storyline . 
 Ion Storm contracted Soundelux Design Music Group to provide music for Anachronox . The firm hired Bill Brown for additional music . Tom Hall was impressed with Brown 's work , particularly music for the planet Democratus . Hall worked with musician Ron Jones and a local Dallas band to record the game 's two funk numbers by mid @-@ 1998 . Tom Hall planned for each character to have their own theme music , and for songs to change via interaction or exploration . He spoke of the planned music , " The Anachronox sound will be industrial , mixed with forties bluesy swing . As you get on later in the game , the music gets scarier , more chaotic , and gets down to hard @-@ core metal . " Developers integrated <unk> support in 1999 to allow dynamic changing of background music . Sound programmer Henrik Jonsson implemented 3D sound and other capabilities using the Miles Sound System . Developers also planned to use software called Magpie Pro to lip @-@ sync animated mouths to spoken words . The team chose not to record voices for each line of dialogue , as Tom Hall felt certain speech would become repetitive . The Undermain Theatre group of Dallas provided several voices . Tom Hall voiced PAL @-@ 18 reportedly because " no one else got it goofy enough " . 
 = = = Promotion and later development = = = 
 Ion Storm debuted a trailer for the game at E3 1997 . The team worked several long nights and slept in a cardboard fort ( named " Fort Nox " ) in the office to prepare the trailer . A thief stole developers ' laptop at the Dallas airport , requiring Ion Storm to upload a new demo for the conference . Hall continued writing and designing ; he invented the <unk> language by creating several phonemes and glyphs of the letter 8 turned on its side . Ben Herrera completed several sketches of characters and worlds by August 1997 , and the team hoped to achieve full engine functionality by September 2 , Hall 's birthday . The game would suffer serious delays in its production . 
 Ion Storm solicited feedback from fans after demonstrating progress on Anachronox at E3 1998 , and assured inclusion of a multiplayer mode . Tom Hall touted , " It is going to be very cinematic and about as non @-@ linear as you can get . Some levels will be bigger than anything ever seen in a 3 @-@ D environment . We are really pushing the engine for this , with loads of textures . " Developers made two demonstrations ; the second featured lasers , lens flare , and volumetric fog . The gaming press received Anachronox well ; one reporter wrote the game was " stunningly beautiful ... [ with ] some of the most superb effects ever seen in a computer game , including rippling water , stunning laser lights and shadow effects " . Another wrote that the game would be " graphically spectacular , with detailed characters " . Panelists at E3 nominated Anachronox in the " Most Promising Game " and " Best RPG " categories for the Game Critics Awards . Ion Storm planned for a 1999 release , and unveiled new screenshots at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show . Among the game 's maps developed in 1998 were Hephaestus ( polished by David Namaksy ) ; <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) ; Democratus , " Matrix 0 " , and certain interiors of Anachronox ( Larry Herring ) ; and the city of Limbus ( Rich Carlson ) . Lead programmer Joey Liaw left Ion Storm to attend Stanford University in mid @-@ 1998 . That November , several developers at Ion Storm departed to form their own company ; among them was David Namaksy , lead level designer for Anachronox . 
 As of January 1999 , Ion Storm CEO Todd Porter expected the game to ship 2 @.@ 5 million copies . Ion Storm decided to produce a sequel for Anachronox around early 1999 , feeling there would otherwise be too much content for one game , requiring prohibitive costs and delays . Team member Brian <unk> noted that several art assets had already been created for the sequel . By May 1999 , the team had settled on a cast of 450 non @-@ player characters , and planned for a late 1999 or early 2000 release date . Ion Storm launched the Anachronox website in early 1999 with a movie @-@ style trailer . Tom Hall featured four Anachronox non @-@ player characters in his online tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek spoof of Kasparov versus the World . Among the game 's maps completed in 1999 were the Bricks slums of Anachronox ( Seneca Menard ) , <unk> ( Josh Jay ) , Sender Station ( Lee Dotson ) , others parts of Democratus ( Matt Sophos ) , the <unk> area of Anachronox ( Brian Patenaude ) , and the junkyard maze of Anachronox . Tom Hall reported in 1999 that an option was being developed to remove adult themes , later manifested as an option to turn off profanity . Ion Storm demonstrated the game at E3 1999 ; the team drove an RV to the event , which suffered a blowout and electrical failure . Computer Games Magazine afterward commented that Anachronox had " wider roots than a Banyan grove and more promise per square byte than a CD collection of political speeches . " 
 Hall personally invented and scripted Boots 's erotic dancing mini @-@ game . He noted , " we 're not above degrading our main character . " Ion Storm showed off the mini @-@ game at E3 2000 , drawing humored reactions . Art director Lee Perry noted in March 2000 that perfecting the battle system was the biggest remaining hurdle for release . Ion Storm promoted a fall 2000 release date in May , and IGN reported in July that a Dreamcast port of Anachronox was planned for production after the PC version 's release . Ion Storm issued a clarification that they were only considering a Dreamcast port . The firm transferred staff who had worked on Daikatana to Anachronox after the former 's release in summer 2000 . The team finished the game 's control setup in August . 
 The team began working six @-@ day weeks by late 2000 . By 2001 , the team was working 12- to 16 @-@ hour days and 6- to 7 @-@ day weeks . Hall described weekly bug meetings before release : " you see 100 bugs at the start of the week , fix the 80 you can replicate , and then meet the next Monday to address the 200 bugs they found , fix the 160 you can replicate , then meet to discuss the 400 they found ... the time in @-@ between is scary . Usually , the programmers find the bug , then stumble out of their cube , ' we were SO lucky to find that ' or ' how did that EVER work ? ' It 's like some bizarre divination method that no one is quite sure how it finds things , but no one wants to ' disturb the mojo ' . " Several Internet rumors that Ion Storm would soon close spread in May 2001 . By June 2001 , all dialogue had been recorded and Ion Storm was working on balancing , playtesting , and adjusting gameplay ; release was set for the next month . Anachronox went gold and shipped to manufacturers in late June .

 Anachronox earned positive reviews from critics , despite production delays and associations with Ion Storm 's ill @-@ received Daikatana . The Daily Telegraph called it the most original game Ion Storm had produced , while The Scotsman 's reviewer appreciated its " many original touches " . PC Gamer featured Anachronox four times in its top 100 PC games lists : # 16 ( 2007 ) , # 17 ( 2008 ) , # 61 ( 2010 ) , & # 76 ( 2015 ) . It was also USA Today 's Game of the Week . Writer Jeff Green lamented that Ion Storm had shut down after Anachronox ; he called it " easily the best console @-@ style RPG ever made for the PC . " 
 Reviewers highlighted the gameplay style , branded an unusual mix between role @-@ playing video games and PC first @-@ person shooters . Some compared it to the Final Fantasy series and the recently released Deus Ex . The Evening Standard wrote , " Anachronox swaps puzzlement for humour while keeping the character interaction , deep storyline and strategic battles that make the Japanese games so good . " Computer Gaming World felt the game " incorporates the best elements of the adventure and role @-@ playing genres . " In contrast , Next Generation Magazine felt the genre @-@ blending resulted in generic gameplay at times . Lyndon Russell of the Herald Sun praised the basic mechanics , though he found the combat predictable . Erik Wolpaw praised the battle system 's unique focus on movement , but wished characters could wait for a turn rather than perform an action . The puzzle elements , such as those brought by Fatima , were well @-@ received , even considered " indispensable " . 
 The game 's aesthetics were strongly praised . One reviewer appreciated the variety of styles in the music ; it has been compared to Yanni , Enya , John Tesh , and sci @-@ fi scores . Alan Dang contrarily found the music at times " neutral " and generic ; Paul Ward found it pleasant but sparse . Numerous critics praised the voice acting and dialogue . The game 's cinematic cutscenes were also acclaimed ; Computer and Video Games noted they were " superbly used for laughs or to create a real sense of dramatic tension " , while Next Generation Magazine wrote that Anachronox would be remembered as the germination point for blending interactive gaming and cinema . The Guardian , while also giving praise , found them somewhat predictable . Several reviewers praised the field map and level design of all but the last levels . Earlier ones were said to contain many " little details that bring the game to life " and significant immersion . The later levels were less well received , with one reviewer suspecting that ION Storm ran out of time to polish the game , as some end @-@ game locations were " hideously ugly , with huge slab @-@ like polygons , dodgy backdrops and pixelated low resolution textures " . The Guardian felt the lighting was too dark in general , while Kevin Cheung of The Sydney Morning Herald found the graphics blocky . 
 Reviewers hailed the story , characters , setting , and dialogue of Anachronox , citing its science fiction themes and offbeat , quirky humor . The Advertiser summarized the plot as " a beefy storyline loaded with strong characters , powerful dialogue , outrageous humour , seemingly endless surprises and a wild ride around the galaxy . " Elliott Chin singled out the game 's humor , which , while divisive of Computer Gaming World 's staff at first , won it the publication 's " Best Use of Humor " 2001 award . Even apart from humor , the dialogue was acclaimed as " so clever , it almost distracts from the game play " and as " very natural and colloquial " . David Gordon of The Independent enjoyed the game for its " dark and ominous " plot and setting , centered on the quest to stop the destruction of the universe . The setting was compared to Blade Runner , film noir , The Matrix , Total Recall and the Dark City franchise . Reviewers enjoyed the game 's odd characters and how the team of " has @-@ beens and rejects " brought new life to the genre , particularly by averting the coming @-@ of @-@ age cliché . Sly was well @-@ received , described as a " typical downtrodden B @-@ movie private eye " , a " Mickey Spillane @-@ style hero " in a cyberpunk setting , and a " space @-@ age Sam Spade " . Several critics complained about the game 's slow start on the planet Anachronox , especially its elevator @-@ riding scenes . Reviewer Elliott Chin disagreed , evoking " a superb sense of timing , starting out small and slowly building to the main event " , while David Phelan stated that strong character writing would encourage gamers to play beyond the " pedestrian @-@ paced " opening scenes . 
 Several critics took issue with the game 's graphics and outdated id Tech 2 engine ; reviewer Stephen Hunt named the game " a muddy affair " due to the " elderly " engine . Some reviewers , however , felt the game 's charm made the engine 's age irrelevant . Reviewers also encountered several software bugs and glitches , among them incompatibility with Windows 2000 and a bug forcing the player to repeat a sequence near the end several times . However , they differed in their opinions of the game as a result of them , ranging from " nearly unplayable " to " a flawed classic . " Reviewers also criticized the game 's restricted resolution choices ; players could only choose from two options at polar ends of hardware requirements .

 Before releasing Anachronox , Ion Storm <unk> characters and adapted sequences from the game for Shiner , a production by the Undermain Theatre . Scenes from the game were used to illustrate the vivid imagination and struggles of a paralyzed woman named Xela . Anachronox references the films Miller 's Crossing and Barton Fink through street addresses on planet Anachronox ; Tom Hall had studied acting at the University of Wisconsin – Madison and volunteered as an usher for Undermain . Though received well , the game did not prevent the closure of Ion Storm 's Dallas office in July 2001 ; John Romero and Tom Hall departed after its release . The game became " semi @-@ obscure " ; Tom Hall explained : " Millions were spent making it , and upon release , $ 50 @,@ 000 advertising it . " He reflected on the game in 2007 : 
 [ It was ] hubris to take 15 people and say you 're going to make a console @-@ style RPG , but , well , that 's what we did . It wasn 't insanely buggy compared to some titles , but it was rushed out the door . Eidos wanted to ship it . If we 'd shipped Joey [ Liaw ] ' s final build , it would have been very stable ... I think most people didn 't know the game was out . I sing the praises of Eidos for sticking with us through all the craziness — they were amazing . But they spent millions on the game , and in the tens of thousands on advertising . I think it could have found a pretty strong audience . But with all the craziness that had gone on , I feel fortunate that people got to experience it at all ... People still write to me saying they found a copy , that they played and loved the game , and that they wished they ’ d heard about it coming out at the time .

 Cinematic director Jake Hughes independently combined the game 's cut @-@ scenes into a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ hour film titled Anachronox : The Movie , released as 13 MPEG files on Machinima.com. The work was considered machinima 's first feature @-@ length production ( incorrectly : the longer film The Seal of <unk> predates it ) and one of its most ambitious projects . Judges at the 2002 Machinima Film Festival ( MFF ) awarded it Best Picture , Best Writing , and Best Technical Achievement . Machinima.com 's editors said of the film , " Anachronox : The Movie is a tour de force , one of the finest Machinima films produced to date , and probably the most accomplished Machinima feature to date . Hell , it managed to hold two overworked jury members in a room for two and a half hours before the MFF 2002 — what more can we say ? " As of 2003 , Machinima.com planned to release the film on DVD with extra footage and artwork .

 Tom Hall felt the story of Anachronox was too large for one game ( requiring an estimated 70 hours of gameplay ) , and planned for two expansion packs in 1998 . Each expansion pack would represent another third of the overall story . He confirmed in 1999 that Anachronox would be followed by only one sequel ; several art assets had already been created for the sequel by mid @-@ 2000 . Hall speculated in 2000 that further adventures in two new universes may take place after the sequel . Ion Storm 's closure nixed plans for a continuation ; Hall has unsuccessfully tried to purchase the intellectual property rights to the Anachronox universe . He later stated that he did not regret ending Anachronox on a cliffhanger , as most characters had resolved their inner turmoil . 
 Hall noted in 2007 that other team members were willing to come back to help : " We went through such turmoil but stayed for the love of the universe , the game and each other . Former team members often mention that if I ever got the intellectual property back and was going to make Anachronox 2 , just tell them when and where . We have , as we say , ' The Love . ' " Hall remarked in 2010 , " If I don 't do the game in the next 10 years , I 'll just write up the rest of the story and put it on my website for closure , how about that ? " 
 On February 17 , 2015 , Square Enix announced that it will allow developers to create games based on some of their old Eidos IPs via the Square Enix Collective project , including the Anachronox IP . 
 = Canberra Roller Derby League = 
 The Canberra Roller Derby League ( CRDL ) is a Canberra @-@ based all @-@ women 's roller derby league . It was created in 2008 , with the first bouts occurring in 2009 . Skaters joined the league during " Fresh Meat " and " Boot Camp " intakes , where they learn skating and derby skills before appearing in bouts nine to twelve months later . 
 Originally there were two teams : the Black N Blue Belles and the Surly Griffins . In 2010 , the league expanded to four teams with the addition of the Red Bellied Black Hearts and the Brindabelters . In addition , there is an all @-@ star team called the Vice City Rollers that competes in interstate bouts against teams from Sydney , Brisbane , Melbourne and Adelaide . 
 At home bouts , the league has attendances as high as 5 @,@ 000 , and has its own stable of male referees who officiate the league and interstate bouts . The 2009 season was won by Surly Griffins and the 2010 season by the Black N Blue Belles . The 2011 season had six bouts scheduled , with the league championship to occur in October 2011 . The league 's bouts are aired on <unk> , and they have had media coverage from 666 ABC Canberra . 
 = = History = = 
 The Canberra Roller Derby League ( CRDL ) was established in 2008 as a volunteer organisation intended to promote roller derby , women 's health and sport in the Australian Capital Territory ( ACT ) . The league was created by Bullseye Betty ( Kate Murphy ) and Dr Hell ( Helen Doyle ) . Other early members include Roulette Rouge ( Lucy Quinn ) and Peachy Keen . The league was intended to resemble the burlesque , and was the first roller derby league in the ACT . 
 The league 's first practices took place in parking lots around the Territory . Dr Hell and Bullseye Betty helped get a screening of the Roller Derby Dolls on 28 July 2008 at The Front Cafe and Gallery in Lyneham in order to generate membership in the new league . At the start of its first season , the league had 26 skaters . The first public bout in 2009 took place at Southern Cross Stadium , Tuggeranong , before a sell out crowd . At the end of the 2009 season , additional information nights were held at The Front Cafe and Gallery on 25 August 2009 and The Hush Lounge in Phillip on 30 August 2009 , and the league held a demonstration at the 2009 UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships . On 21 November 2009 , it held a roller derby rodeo at the Southern Cross Stadium with tickets being sold at Smith 's Bookshop . By 2011 , tickets for the league 's events would be sold through <unk> . 
 The presence of the league in Canberra has helped change the perception of the sport in the capital from an entertaining sideshow to a mainstream women 's participation sport . The popularity of roller derby in Canberra has meant that the CRDL cannot accommodate all the women in Canberra who want to participate . To address this issue , in 2011 , some roller derby enthusiasts worked on starting a new league as a student organisation at Australian National University . 
 The CRDL stepped up to help other leagues in the country . In 2009 , members of the Canberra Roller Derby League competed as substitutes for the Sydney Roller Derby League 's Screaming Assault Sirens in its grand final , after one member of the Sirens was quarantined with swine flu , and several other skaters were out injured . 
 The Canberra Roller Derby League was featured in the 2012 documentary film This is Roller Derby ( 2012 film ) . 
 = = Organisation and structure = =

The CRDL is considered the most professional league in the country . 
 The league is structured to protect the safety of its skaters . New roller derby competitors advance through tiers . At each level , they learn and perfect specific derby skills , experience and general fitness . This helps to avoid injury and improve the quality of the competition . The time between joining and getting to compete in a bout is generally nine to twelve months . Skaters practice for roughly eight total hours a week , mostly during two weekly practices that last around three hours . 
 In April 2013 , Canberra was accepted as a member of the Women 's Flat Track Derby Association Apprentice Program .

 = Rani Mukerji = 
 Rani Mukerji ( / <unk> <unk> / ; born 21 March 1978 ) is an Indian actress . Through her Bollywood career , she has become one of the most high @-@ profile celebrities in India , winning several awards , including seven Filmfare Awards . Her film roles have been cited as a significant departure from the traditional portrayal of women in Bollywood . 
 Although Mukerji was born into the Mukherjee @-@ Samarth family , in which her parents and relatives were members of the Indian film industry , she did not aspire to pursue a career in film . However , while still a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in her father 's Bengali language film <unk> Phool ( 1996 ) and later accepted a leading role in the 1997 social drama Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat on the insistence of her mother . She then began a full @-@ time career in film and gained recognition for a supporting role in the romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai ( 1998 ) . After this initial success in her career , Mukerji 's films fared poorly at the box office for the next three years . Her career prospects improved when Yash Raj Films cast her as the star of the drama Saathiya ( 2002 ) . 
 By 2004 , Mukerji had established herself as a leading actress of Bollywood with roles in the romantic comedy Hum Tum , and the dramas Yuva and Veer @-@ Zaara . She achieved further success for portraying a deaf , blind and mute woman in the acclaimed drama Black ( 2005 ) and an unhappily married woman in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna ( 2006 ) . Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to criticise her for choosing poor roles and pairing with the same set of actors . The semi @-@ biographical thriller No One Killed Jessica ( 2011 ) proved to be her first box office hit in four years , and she followed it by starring in the successful thrillers Talaash : The Answer Lies Within ( 2012 ) and Mardaani ( 2014 ) . 
 In addition to acting in films , Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children . She has participated in concert tours and stage shows , and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show Dance Premier League . Though she is reticent to discuss her personal life in public , her off @-@ screen life is the subject of substantial media coverage in India .

 Rani Mukerji was born in Mumbai on 21 March 1978 . Her father , Ram Mukherjee ( born to the Mukherjee @-@ Samarth family ) , is a former film director and one of the founders of <unk> Studios . Her mother , Krishna Mukherjee , is a former playback singer . Her elder brother , Raja Mukherjee , is a film producer and director . Her maternal aunt , <unk> Roy , is a Bengali film actress and her paternal cousin , Kajol , is a Hindi film actress and her contemporary . Another paternal cousin , Ayan Mukerji , is a scriptwriter and film director . Despite her parents and most of her relatives being members of the Indian film industry , Mukerji was uninterested in pursuing a career in film . She said , " There were already too many actresses at home and I wanted to be someone different " . 
 Mukerji received her education at Maneckji Cooper High School in Juhu and graduated with a degree in Home Science from <unk> Women 's University . She is a trained Odissi dancer and began learning the dance form while in the tenth grade . As part of an annual tradition , the Mukherjee family celebrates the festival of Durga Puja in the suburban neighbourhood of Santacruz every year . Mukerji , a practising Hindu , takes part in the festivities with her entire family . 
 In 1994 , director Salim Khan approached her to play the lead female role in his directorial , Aa Gale Lag Jaa . Her father disapproved of a full @-@ time career in film at such a young age , so she rejected the offer . At the age of eighteen , Mukerji experimented with acting by portraying a supporting role in her father 's Bengali language film <unk> Phool ( 1996 ) . The film starred <unk> and Indrani Haldar in lead roles and narrates the story of two sisters ; Mukerji played the younger sibling of Haldar 's character . Soon after , Khan approached her with another film offer to play the protagonist of the social drama Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat , Mukerji accepted the role due to her mother 's insistence that she continue to pursue acting on an experimental basis . Before she began work on the film , Mukerji trained at Roshan Taneja 's acting institute .

 Mukerji portrayed a rape victim who is forced to marry her rapist in Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat , which released in 1997 . Although the film was a commercial failure , Mukerji 's performance was praised , and she won a special recognition trophy at the annual Screen Awards ceremony . Following the film 's poor showing at the box office , Mukerji returned to college to complete her education . However , inspired by her cousin Kajol 's success in Bollywood , she decided to pursue a full @-@ time career in films . 
 In 1998 , Mukerji starred opposite Aamir Khan in Vikram Bhatt 's Ghulam ( 1998 ) , a moderate commercial success . Though her role in the film was small , the song " Aati Kya <unk> " earned her widespread recognition . Due to Mukerji 's broken voice texture , Bhatt hired a dubbing artist with a much higher pitched voice to dub for her lines . When asked if the director 's decision to not use her voice in the film affected her , she said that her voice was dubbed as it " did not suit the character " . 
 Later that year , Karan Johar cast Mukerji opposite Shah Rukh Khan and her cousin , Kajol , in his big @-@ budget directorial debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai . The role was originally written for Twinkle Khanna , but when she rejected it , Johar approached several leading actresses , all of whom refused the offer . He eventually cast Mukerji after she volunteered to play the role . Johar had originally intended that a dubbing artist dub Mukerji 's lines in the film , but she improved her diction and eventually dubbed for her own lines . She portrayed Tina Malhotra , a college student who is in a relationship with Khan 's character . Writing for India Today , film critic Nandita Chowdhury considered Mukerji to be the scene @-@ stealer and added , " <unk> oomph from every pore , she [ .. ] proves herself an actress whose time has come . " Kuch Kuch Hota Hai proved a breakthrough for Mukerji ; it emerged as a blockbuster in India and abroad with earnings of over ₹ 1 @.@ 03 billion ( US $ 15 million ) , and won eight Filmfare Awards , including a Best Supporting Actress trophy for Mukerji . 
 Following the success of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai , Mukerji played leading roles in the social drama Mehndi ( 1998 ) and the comedy Hello Brother ( 1999 ) . Both these films were critical and commercial disappointments which failed to propel her career forward . 
 = = = Career struggles and initial success ( 2000 – 03 ) = = = 
 By 2000 , Mukerji wanted to avoid being type @-@ cast as a " standard Hindi film heroine " and thus decided to portray more challenging roles in addition to the archetypical glamorous female lead . However , none of her film releases in 2000 were particularly notable . In Badal and <unk> , two male @-@ centric action dramas ( both featuring Bobby Deol in the lead ) , she played roles that were met with little acclaim from the critics . A supporting role in Kamal Hassan 's bilingual film Hey Ram proved more rewarding . The film was a partly fictionalised account of Mahatma Gandhi 's assassination and Mukerji portrayed the character of Aparna Ram , a Bengali school teacher who is raped and murdered during communal riots in Calcutta . The controversial subject matter of Hey Ram led to poor box office earnings , but the film was critically acclaimed and selected as India 's official entry to the Oscars that year . Mukerji found no success in her next two releases , the comedy <unk> Kar Di <unk> and the romance Kahin Pyaar Na Ho <unk> . The romantic comedy Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega , however , earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare and was better received by the critics . <unk> Nair of Screen found Mukerji 's role to be " too meagre for her to prove herself " but added that " she is quite adequate in whatever scenes she has been given " . 
 The year 2001 was a disappointing one for Mukerji . In a review for her first release of the year , Chori Chori Chupke Chupke , a drama based on surrogate childbirth , film critic Sukanya Verma found Mukerji to be " handicapped with a role that doesn 't give her much scope besides weeping and sobbing " and preferred the " meatier " role of her co @-@ star Preity Zinta . In Bas <unk> Sa <unk> Hai and Nayak : The Real Hero , films that failed to garner praise , Mukerji played the love interests of Abhishek Bachchan and Anil Kapoor respectively . In a review for the latter , Sarita Tanwar wrote that " [ Mukerji ] has very little to do except being part of some magnificently picturised songs " . 
 After three consecutive years of poorly received films , Mukerji 's career prospects began to improve in 2002 when Yash Raj Films , a leading production company in India , cast her for two high @-@ profile productions : Mujhse Dosti Karoge ! , a romantic comedy co @-@ starring Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor , and Saathiya , a remake of the Tamil box office hit Alaipayuthey . Mujhse Dosti Karoge ! was heavily promoted before release and proved a success internationally , but failed to earn profits in India . The romantic drama Saathiya proved a major turning point in her career , winning her a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress in addition to a Best Actress nomination at the same ceremony . Mukerji was director Shaad Ali 's only choice to play the lead role ; he said , " She was born to play this role . She looked the character . She looked vulnerable . She looked the right age . She was perfect " . The film co @-@ starred Vivek Oberoi , and her paternal aunt Tanuja , and proved an economic success . Mukerji 's portrayal of <unk> Sharma , a medical student who deals with the tensions and discontent of being married at a young age , met with critical acclaim . The BBC stated that " Mukerji plays the character of a middle class girl with great conviction " , and Udita Jhunjhunwala of Mid Day added , " Her expressions and acting are understated in a role that fits her like a glove . " 
 In 2003 , Mukerji replaced Aishwarya Rai to play the lead female role opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Aziz Mirza 's romance Chalte Chalte . Media reports suggested that Rai was replaced after feuding with her then boyfriend Salman Khan on the film 's sets , but Shah Rukh Khan insisted that Mukerji had been the original choice for the role . The film 's concept was similar to Saathiya and dealt with misunderstandings between a married couple . Mukerji said , " [ Unlike Saathiya ] , Chalte Chalte deals with a more mature and deeper form of love . It is about how a man and woman react to situations . [ .. ] You cannot really get very different with the characters , but you can put them against a different background " . The film was well received by both critics and audiences , and the following year Mukerji received a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare . Also that year , she starred in Milan Luthria 's romantic comedy Chori Chori opposite Ajay Devgan , Sudhir Mishra 's suspense drama Calcutta Mail , alongside Anil Kapoor and Manisha Koirala , and J.P. Dutta 's ensemble war film LOC Kargil . None of these films fared well critically or commercially .

 The year 2004 marked the beginning of the most successful period in Mukerji 's career . At the 50th Filmfare Awards in 2005 , Mukerji won both the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress awards , becoming the only actress to win both awards in the same year . The Best Supporting Actress win was for Mani Ratnam 's Yuva ( 2004 ) , a composite film that featured an ensemble cast including Ajay Devgan , Abhishek Bachchan , Vivek Oberoi , Kareena Kapoor and Esha Deol . The film narrates the story of three youngsters from different strata of society whose lives intersect by a car accident ; Mukerji was cast as Shashi Biswas , a financially deprived Bengali housewife who is abused by her husband , a local goon ( played by Bachchan ) . Taran Adarsh wrote , " Amongst the leading ladies , it is Rani Mukerji who is the best of the lot . The role demanded an actress of substance and Rani more than lives up to the expectations . " She won the Best Actress award for her starring role in Kunal Kohli 's Hum Tum ( 2004 ) , a romantic comedy about two headstrong individuals who meet at different stages of their lives . The film pitted her opposite Saif Ali Khan and proved one of the biggest commercial successes of the year . The Hindu found Mukerji 's portrayal of Rhea Prakash to be " self assuredly competent " and <unk> Kumar Nanda of Rediff.com wrote , " Rani is her usual collected self , changing into the many hues of her character with the ease of a chameleon " . 
 Later that year , Mukerji achieved further success when Yash Chopra cast her alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta in his romantic drama Veer @-@ Zaara . The film narrates the story of star @-@ crossed lovers , Veer Pratap Singh ( played by Khan ) and a Pakistani woman , Zaara <unk> Khan ( played by Zinta ) ; Mukerji played the role of <unk> Siddiqui , a Pakistani lawyer embroiled in a court case involving Singh . With a worldwide gross of over ₹ 940 million ( US $ 14 million ) , Veer @-@ Zaara emerged as the highest grossing film of the year ; it was screened at the Berlin Film Festival and met with critical acclaim . Mukerji 's role was praised by the critics ; BBC noted , " [ I ] ts Rani <unk> who deserves praise for her acting . To act through your eyes and not using dialogue is an art . Rani for one , has perfected this . " She won the Best Supporting Actress trophy at the IIFA Awards ceremony , and received a nomination in the same category at Filmfare . 
 In 2005 , Outlook magazine published that Mukerji had established herself as the most successful actress of contemporary Hindi cinema . Her first film role that year was opposite Amitabh Bachchan in Sanjay Leela Bhansali 's highly acclaimed Black , a drama about an alcoholic man who dedicates his life to teach a blind and deaf girl how to communicate . Bhansali wrote the part of the blind @-@ deaf girl specifically for Mukerji , who was initially hesitant to take on the role due to its " challenging " subject matter . Once Bhansali enforced his faith in her , she agreed and began intensely studying sign language with professionals at the Helen Keller Institute in Mumbai . Black won several awards including two National Film Awards and eleven Filmfare Awards , and Richard Corliss of TIME featured it as the fifth best film of the year . Mukerji 's performance met with unanimous acclaim ; Empire called the performance " astonishing " , Filmfare included her work in their listing of Indian cinema 's " 80 Most Iconic performances " and wrote , " Rani has left an indelible mark with this role that usually comes once in a lifetime for most " . She became the only actress to win both the Best Actress and Best Actress – Critics trophies at the Filmfare Awards ceremony . 
 That year , Mukerji received a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her work opposite Abhishek Bachchan in Bunty Aur Babli , a comedy film which marked her fifth collaboration with Yash Raj Films . She played the title character of <unk> " Babli " <unk> , a con woman . The film was the second highest grossing film of 2005 and Mukerji 's third major success in two consecutive years . Film critic Namrata Joshi wrote that " Rani plays to the gallery with ease " and Taran Adarsh wrote that she " sinks her teeth into the role and comes out with flying colours " . She followed it with Amol <unk> 's fantasy film Paheli , reuniting her with Shah Rukh Khan . The film was a box office flop in India but was given a strong international release ; it was screened at the Sundance Film Festival and was India 's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards . Raja Sen of Rediff.com was impressed by the film as well as Mukerji 's performance which he called " another perfectly played part " . Mukerji 's fourth and final release of the year was the highly anticipated period film Mangal Pandey : The Rising . Director Ketan Mehta initially approached her for a cameo appearance , which was developed into an " important part " after she gave her consent to star in the film . Her role was that of Heera , a prostitute who forms the love interest of the title character ( played by Aamir Khan ) . Derek Elley of Variety mentioned that Mukerji made " the most of her feisty nautch @-@ girl , " despite having " a small role for a star of her caliber . " 
 Mukerji turned down an offer from Mira Nair to star in the Hollywood film The Namesake , choosing instead to collaborate once again with her friend Karan Johar in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna ( 2006 ) , an urban drama dealing with infidelity and dysfunctional relationships . The high @-@ profile production featured an ensemble cast of Amitabh Bachchan , Shah Rukh Khan , Abhishek Bachchan , Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher , and told the story of two unhappily married couples in New York which results in an extra @-@ marital affair . Mukerji played Maya Talwar , a woman layered with self @-@ doubt and question about the relationship between her husband ( played by Abhishek Bachchan ) and herself . Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was a popular release , emerging as a major economic success with gross earnings of over ₹ 1 @.@ 13 billion ( US $ 17 million ) . Rajeev Masand of CNN @-@ IBN wrote , " Rani looks a million bucks and she dives under the skin of her character to make that part one that we will remember for a long time " . The role won Mukerji a third consecutive IIFA Best Actress Award and among other nods , earned her a sixth Best Actress nomination at Filmfare . The poorly received melodrama <unk> was her final appearance that year .

 Following the failure of <unk> , Yash Raj Films cast Mukerji in Siddharth Anand 's family drama Ta Ra Rum Pum in the role of a popular racing driver 's ( played by Saif Ali Khan ) wife and the mother of two . Mukerji was excited to play the part of a mother for the first time , and modelled her character after her own mother . Released in 2007 , the film was an economic success , but received mixed reactions from the critics . Khalid Mohamed hailed Mukerji 's performance as " near flawless " but Rajeev Masand thought that neither she nor Khan " are able to make much of an impression because their characters are so <unk> and boring . " The woman 's film Laaga Chunari Mein Daag from director Pradeep Sarkar was Mukerji 's second release that year . She described the film as a " journey of a girl into womanhood and her sacrifices for her family " . Her portrayal earned her a seventh Best Actress nomination at Filmfare , she played the role of Vibhavari Sahay , a young girl of limited means who is forced to moonlight as a prostitute to fend for her family . Jaya Bachchan , Abhishek Bachchan , Konkana Sen Sharma and Kunal Kapoor co @-@ starred in the film which released to poor box office returns and little praise from the critics . The Indian Express noted that Mukerji was responsible for " hold [ ing ] the film together , even if her part , both as the ingénue and the hooker , doesn 't have freshness " . 
 Mukerji played a prostitute for the third time in Sanjay Leela Bhansali 's Saawariya , an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky 's White Nights , co @-@ starring Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor . Mukerji said , " I play very different kinds of prostitutes in Saawariya and Laaga Chunari Mein Daag . The woman in Saawariya has no problem with her profession , whereas in the other film it 's completely different " . Saawariya was her only release in three years that was not produced by Yash Raj Films . The film was a box office flop and met with polarising reactions from the critics . Mukerji 's performance was received favourably and she earned her second Filmfare nomination that year , this time for Best Supporting Actress . By the end of 2007 , Mukerji 's popularity had begun to wane . Rediff.com attributed this to her " monotonous pairing " with the same set of actors ; Hindustan Times published that she had become an " exclusive Yash Raj heroine " which hindered other directors to approach her for roles . 
 After a series of serious roles , Mukerji sought to play a part that would be a " clutter @-@ breaker " for her . She found the role in Kunal Kohli 's Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic ( 2008 ) , a children 's film about an angel who comes to Earth to help four troubled kids . In a particularly scathing review , Khalid Mohamed criticised Mukerji 's choice of roles and wrote , " As a Geeta Poppins , she 's one @-@ dimensional , either darting full blast smiles or tetchy scowls . Her costumes , too , are uneasy @-@ on @-@ the @-@ eyes " . The film had low box office returns and further contributed to a decline in Mukerji 's career prospects . An India Today article spoke of her " running out of luck at the box office " and mentioned her decline in endorsements . 
 In an attempt to overcome this decline in her career , Mukerji lost weight and underwent a complete makeover . In 2009 , she collaborated for the ninth time with Yash Raj Films on Dil Bole <unk> ! , a romantic comedy opposite Shahid Kapoor . Mukerji had high expectations from the film in which she played a cricket @-@ obsessed Punjabi village girl masquerading as a man ; it was hugely hyped before release and had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival . The Economic Times critic Gaurav Malani was disappointed with the picture and wrote , " Rani Mukherjee comes up with a spirited performance but her mock sob @-@ whine @-@ whimper do [ es ] not amuse anymore . Also after a point you dislike visualizing the charming actress as the moustached male player . " The film was Mukerji 's fourth economic failure in a row . When questioned about her recent spate of flops with the Yash Raj Films banner , she stated , " An actor is here to act and pick great roles and scripts . I was getting great roles from Yash Raj at that point , roles that any actor would give an arm to do . I stand by those films regardless of their fate " . Later that year , she featured as a talent judge for the Sony Entertainment Television reality show Dance Premier League . She said that appearing on television would make her " more accessible " to the audiences and help her " gain visibility " when she was " not doing too many films " . Mukerji did not make any screen appearances in 2010 .

 Film critic Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis described Mukerji 's performance in the 2011 film No One Killed Jessica as " one of her best performances till date " . The film ( co @-@ starring Vidya Balan ) was Mukerji 's first commercial success since Ta Ra Rum Pum , and was especially noted for being a success despite the absence of a prominent male actor . The film was a semi @-@ biographical thriller based on the Jessica Lal murder case in which Mukerji played the fictional character of Meera <unk> , a foul @-@ mouthed television journalist who is deeply involved with the case . To promote the film , she reprised the role of <unk> on the C.I.D. television series . In an interview with The Telegraph she said , " It was such a different role to portray . It wasn 't a role that was typical of a Hindi film heroine . Meera was more like a hero . It was a character that actually took the story forward . [ .. ] Meera made a lot of things happen . It wasn 't something that I had ever done before . I actually had to play a man ! " Certain critics , however , were critical of her performance , including Anupama Chopra of NDTV , who called her role , " the fatal , false note in No One Killed Jessica , " arguing that " the character is written superficially and Rani 's portrayal of her is equally banal . It 's all about externals . She argues a lot and proudly labels herself a bitch but her hair stays perfectly in place and in the end , she even gets to do a super @-@ hero @-@ like slow motion walk . " Nonetheless , the role earned her several awards and nominations , including a third Best Supporting Actress trophy at Filmfare . 
 After the success of No One Killed Jessica , Mukerji accepted a leading role in Sachin <unk> 's <unk> ( 2012 ) , a comedy of manners co @-@ starring Prithviraj . She played Meenakshi Deshpande , a woman with a heightened sense of smell who develops a one @-@ sided attraction towards <unk> 's character . Critically and commercially unsuccessful . Rediff.com criticised her decision to star in the film , writing that she " gets no support from the way her character is written " . Greater success came for her portrayal of Roshni <unk> , a mother who has lost her only child in a boating accident , in Reema Kagti 's psychological thriller Talaash : The Answer Lies Within . Co @-@ starring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor , the film had worldwide earnings of over ₹ 1 @.@ 74 billion ( US $ 26 million ) . Ronnie <unk> of Variety described Mukerji as " vivid in a quietly sympathetic role " , and she received Best Supporting Actress nominations at several award ceremonies , including Filmfare . 
 The following year , Mukerji starred in the anthology film Bombay Talkies consisting of four short films . Mukerji was part of the segment entitled <unk> <unk> Hai Yeh in which she played Gayatri , a journalist who discovers that her husband ( played by Randeep Hooda ) is gay ; it was her fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar . The film was screened at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival as part of the centenary year celebrations of Indian cinema . Despite poor box office returns , Bombay Talkies met with widespread critical acclaim , with praise directed to Johar 's segment . Tushar Joshi of Daily News and Analysis said that Mukerji was successful in " proving [ that ] she 's the queen of subtlety when it comes to stripping off the make @-@ up and letting herself fly " . 
 In 2014 , Mukerji appeared in Pradeep Sarkar 's crime thriller Mardaani , in which she played the lead role of Shivani Shivaji Roy , a Maharashtrian policewoman involved in a kidnapping case that leads her to uncover secrets of human trafficking in India . She took on the role " to show all girls what the reality is , what the world has come to , and how they need to protect themselves " . In preparation , she interacted with senior officials of Mumbai 's crime branch , and learned the Israeli self @-@ defense technique of Krav Maga . Rajeev Masand found Mukerji to be the prime asset of the film , adding that by " investing Shivani with both physical strength and emotional courage , she gives us a hero that 's hard not to root for " . Writing for Hindustan Times , Anupama Chopra also praised her performance , writing that she not only " imbues Shivani with steely resolve but also gives her emotional depth " . The film was a commercial success and garnered Mukerji another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare .

 Despite constant media attention , Mukerji remains guarded about her personal life . Unlike many other celebrities , Mukerji limits her interactions with the media and is sometimes labelled a recluse ; she said in a 2011 interview , " Today actors have become more open with the media . But this has posed a problem for actors like me because if I don 't do that , then I end up being called reclusive . So now I have changed myself and am easily approachable . " Mukerji has collaborated frequently and maintained a close friendship with actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan , and filmmaker Karan Johar . The nature of Mukerji 's relationship with filmmaker Aditya Chopra was the topic of fervent tabloid reporting in India , though she refused to publicly talk about it . On 21 April 2014 , she married Chopra at a private ceremony in Italy . On 9 December 2015 , she gave birth to their daughter , named <unk> . 
 Alongside her acting career , Mukerji has been actively involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children . Mukerji was appointed as an ambassador by Procter & Gamble and the NGO Child Rights and You for their joint venture , Shiksha , to endorse the cause of children 's education . In 2011 she set up a Stroke Treatment Fund , in association with the Indian Stroke Association , to pay for the treatment of financially deprived stroke @-@ affected patients . 
 Mukerji has made public appearances to support other charities and causes . In March 2004 , she visited the Indian army unit in Pokhran , Rajasthan to interact with the <unk> troops , for the NDTV reality show Jai Jawan . A decade later , in August 2014 she visited the jawans again at Baramulla . In February 2005 , Mukerji and several other Bollywood actors participated in the 2005 HELP ! Telethon Concert to raise money for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake . In March 2006 , Mukerji celebrated her birthday with the physically challenged children of the Helen Keller Institute ; she had previously worked with them while preparing for her role in Black . In November 2010 , she was part of a fund raising auction for the " Because I am a Girl " charity campaign . In 2014 , Mukerji attended a charity dinner on child abuse in London , where she was <unk> by Prince Charles for raising awareness on the issue through her work in Mardaani . 
 Mukerji has participated in several concert tours and televised award ceremonies . Her first concert tour , " Magnificent Five " , was in 1999 in which she performed with actors Aamir Khan , Aishwarya Rai , Akshaye Khanna and Twinkle Khanna . The " Temptations 2004 " concert had Mukerji perform alongside Shah Rukh Khan , Saif Ali Khan , Preity Zinta , Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra in nineteen stage shows worldwide .

 Mukerji has been described by the critics as one of the most accomplished actresses of Bollywood . As part of a career analysis , Sukanya Verma noted that Mukerji made a " rather unconventional debut in films " ( she played a rape victim in Raja Ki Aayegi Baarat ) , and after a few years of oscillating between success and failure , she " achieved the status of a star , performer and showgirl " . Indo @-@ Asian News Service reported that during her initial years in the industry , Mukerji was referred to as the successful Kajol 's poor cousin and was written off by the critics for being " plump " and " short " . Raja Sen added that despite the odds being against her , Mukerji " slogged her way with grit " and emerged as " the most powerful leading lady in Bollywood " . Film critic Baradwaj Rangan of the New Sunday Express writes that Mukerji 's unusual " sandpaper @-@ scratchy , I 'm @-@ recovering @-@ from @-@ a @-@ bad @-@ cold " voice sets her apart from her contemporaries and The Times of India has credited her for breaking the " fairness myth " of Bollywood . 
 Reema Kagti ( the director of Talaash : The Answer Lies Within ) said of Mukerji 's craft , " Rani likes to prepare a lot . She gets obsessive about the role and wants to know everything about her character . What 's her character 's back @-@ story , what is going on in her head at a specific point " . In an interview with Daily News and Analysis , Mukerji described her approach to acting : 
 " A month before I start shooting , I sit with my director , try to understand how he has visualised the character on the screen and take notes . Then I start working on the most basic thing — the look . It 's very important that the physical appearance of the character gets decided because if I look the character , it makes it all the more believable . Once that is achieved , I go into the finer nuances of what the girl is like , her background . And then from there [ .. ] I have to get the accent right " . 
 To avoid getting " saturated " , Mukerji prefers portraying " drastically different roles " , and is credited in the media as " one of the most versatile actresses " of Bollywood . She has played roles in both high @-@ profile mainstream productions and lesser @-@ publicised films of independent filmmakers ; Hindustan Times published that Mukerji has made this progression so " natural [ ly ] [ .. ] that it 's gone virtually unnoticed " . Namrata Joshi of Outlook adds that she is unafraid to take risks and portray roles that " none of her contemporaries have been able to do " . Mukerji has garnered a reputation for playing roles that are a significant departure from the traditional portrayal of women in mainstream Indian cinema ; in Hum Tum she played a widow who engages in pre @-@ marital sex , in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna she is involved in an extra @-@ marital affair with a married man , and in <unk> and No One Killed Jessica she smokes , drinks , and utters expletives . 
 Mukerji is one of the best @-@ known and most high @-@ profile celebrities in India ; at the peak of her career she was frequently listed as one of the most popular and attractive Indian celebrities , was one of the highest paid actresses in Bollywood , and the brand ambassador for a number of products . Filmfare featured her in their listing of the " Ten Most Powerful Names of Bollywood " for two consecutive years ( 2005 – 2006 ) . In 2006 , Eastern Eye ranked her as one of " Asia 's Sexiest Women " . Mukerji ranked first on Box Office India 's ' " Top Actresses " listing for two consecutive years ( 2005 – 2006 ) .

 Every new term greater than million is one thousand times larger than the previous term . Thus , billion means a thousand millions ( 109 ) , trillion means a thousand billions ( 1012 ) , and so on . 
 For whole numbers less than a thousand million ( < 109 ) the two scales are identical . From a thousand million up ( ≥ 109 ) the two scales diverge , using the same words for different numbers ; this can cause misunderstanding . 
 Countries where the long scale is currently used include most countries in continental Europe and most French @-@ speaking , Spanish @-@ speaking , and Portuguese @-@ speaking countries except Brazil . The short scale is now used in most English @-@ speaking and Arabic @-@ speaking countries , in Brazil , and several other countries . Number names are rendered in the language of the country , but are similar everywhere due to shared etymology ( e.g. , billion is billón in Spanish ) . Some languages , particularly in East Asia and South Asia , have large number naming systems that are different from both the long and short scales , for example the Indian numbering system . 
 For most of the 19th and 20th centuries , the United Kingdom largely used the long scale , whereas the United States used the short scale , so that the two systems were often referred to as British and American in the English language . After several decades of increasing informal British usage of the short scale , in 1974 the government of the UK adopted it , and it is used for all purposes including official . With very few exceptions , the British usage and American usage are now identical . 
 The first recorded use of the terms short scale ( French : échelle <unk> ) and long scale ( French : échelle longue ) was by the French mathematician Geneviève <unk> in 1975 . 
 = = Comparison = = 
 At and above a thousand million ( ≥ 109 ) the same names are used to refer to numbers differing by a factor of an integer power of 1 @,@ 000 . 
 Each scale has a logical justification to explain the use of each such differing numerical name and value within that scale . The short @-@ scale logic is based on powers of one thousand , whereas the long @-@ scale logic is based on powers of one million . In both scales , the prefix <unk> refers to 2 and tri- refers to 3 , etc . However only in the long scale do the prefixes beyond one million indicate the actual power or exponent ( of 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ) . In the short scale , the prefixes refer to one less than the exponent ( of 1 @,@ 000 ) . 
 The relationship between the numeric values and the corresponding names in the two scales can be described as : 
 The relationship between the names and the corresponding numeric values in the two scales can be described as : 
 The root mil in million does not refer to the numeral , 1 . The word , million , derives from the Old French , <unk> , from the earlier Old Italian , <unk> , an intensification of the Latin word , mille , a thousand . That is , a million is a big thousand , much as a great gross is a dozen gross or 12 × 144 = 1728 . 
 The word , milliard , or its translation , is found in many European languages and is used in those languages for 109 . However , it is unknown in American English , which uses billion , and not used in British English , which preferred to use thousand million before the current usage of billion . The financial term , yard , which derives from milliard , is used on financial markets , as , unlike the term , billion , it is internationally unambiguous and phonetically distinct from million . Likewise , many long scale countries use the word billiard ( or similar ) for one thousand long scale billions ( i.e. , 1015 ) , and the word <unk> ( or similar ) for one thousand long scale trillions ( i.e. , 1021 ) , etc . 
 = = History = = 
 The existence of the different scales means that care must be taken when comparing large numbers between languages or countries , or when interpreting old documents in countries where the dominant scale has changed over time . For example , British English , French , and Italian historical documents can refer to either the short or long scale , depending on the date of the document , since each of the three countries has used both systems at various times in its history . Today , the United Kingdom officially uses the short scale , but France and Italy use the long scale . 
 The pre @-@ 1974 former British English word billion , post @-@ 1961 current French word billion , post @-@ 1994 current Italian word <unk> , German Billion ; Dutch <unk> ; Swedish <unk> ; Finnish <unk> ; Danish billion ; Polish <unk> , Spanish billón ; Slovenian <unk> and the European Portuguese word <unk> ( with a different spelling to the Brazilian Portuguese variant , but in Brazil referring to short scale ) all refer to 1012 , being long @-@ scale terms . Therefore , each of these words translates to the American English or post @-@ 1974 British English word : trillion ( 1012 in the short scale ) , and not billion ( 109 in the short scale ) . 
 On the other hand , the pre @-@ 1961 former French word billion , pre @-@ 1994 former Italian word <unk> , Brazilian Portuguese word <unk> and the Welsh word <unk> all refer to 109 , being short scale terms . Each of these words translates to the American English or post @-@ 1974 British English word billion ( 109 in the short scale ) . 
 The terms billion and milliard both originally meant 1012 when introduced . 
 In long scale countries , milliard was redefined down to its current value of 109 , leaving billion at its original 1012 value and so on for the larger numbers . Some of these countries , but not all , introduced new words billiard , <unk> , etc. as intermediate terms . 
 In some short scale countries , milliard was redefined down to 109 and billion dropped altogether , with trillion redefined down to 1012 and so on for the larger numbers . 
 In many short scale countries , milliard was dropped altogether and billion was redefined down to 109 , adjusting downwards the value of trillion and all the larger numbers .

 Unambiguous ways of identifying large numbers include : 
 In written communications , the simplest solution for moderately large numbers is to write the full amount , for example 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 rather than , say , 1 trillion ( short scale ) or 1 billion ( long scale ) . 
 Combinations of the unambiguous word million , for example : 109 
 = " one thousand million " ; 1012 = 
 " one million million " . This becomes rather unwieldy for numbers above 1012 . 
 Combination of numbers of more than 3 digits with the unambiguous word million , for example 13 @,@ 600 million 
 Scientific notation ( also known as standard form or exponential notation , for example 1 × 109 , 1 × 1010 , 1 × 1011 , 1 × 1012 , etc . ) , or its engineering notation variant ( for example 1 × 109 , 10 × 109 , 100 × 109 , 1 × 1012 , etc . ) , or the computing variant E notation ( for example <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . ) This is the most common practice among scientists and mathematicians , and is both unambiguous and convenient . 
 SI prefixes in combination with SI units , for example , giga for 109 and <unk> for 1012 can give gigawatt ( = 109 W ) and terawatt ( = 1012 W ) , respectively . The International System of Units ( SI ) is independent of whichever scale is being used . Use with non @-@ SI units ( e.g. " giga @-@ dollars " , " giga @-@ miles " ) is uncommon although " <unk> " is in informal use representing a large sum of money rather than exactly a million dollars . 
 = Jack Sheppard = 
 Jack Sheppard ( 4 March 1702 – 16 November 1724 ) was a notorious English thief and gaol @-@ breaker of early 18th @-@ century London . Born into a poor family , he was apprenticed as a carpenter but took to theft and burglary in 1723 , with little more than a year of his training to complete . He was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724 but escaped four times from prison , making him a notorious public figure , and wildly popular with the poorer classes . Ultimately , he was caught , convicted , and hanged at Tyburn , ending his brief criminal career after less than two years . The inability of the notorious " Thief @-@ Taker General " Jonathan Wild to control Sheppard , and injuries suffered by Wild at the hands of Sheppard 's colleague , Joseph " Blueskin " Blake , led to Wild 's downfall . 
 Sheppard was as renowned for his attempts to escape from prison as he was for his crimes . An autobiographical " Narrative " , thought to have been ghostwritten by Daniel Defoe , was sold at his execution , quickly followed by popular plays . The character of Macheath in John Gay 's The Beggar 's Opera ( 1728 ) was based on Sheppard , keeping him in the limelight for over 100 years . He returned to the public consciousness around 1840 , when William Harrison Ainsworth wrote a novel entitled Jack Sheppard , with illustrations by George Cruikshank . The popularity of his tale , and the fear that others would be drawn to emulate his behaviour , led the authorities to refuse to license any plays in London with " Jack Sheppard " in the title for forty years . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Sheppard was born in White 's Row , in London 's Spitalfields . He was baptised on 5 March , the day after he was born , at St Dunstan 's , Stepney , suggesting a fear of infant mortality by his parents , perhaps because the newborn was weak or sickly . His parents named him after an older brother , John , who had died before his birth . In life , he was better known as Jack , or even " Gentleman Jack " or " Jack the Lad " . He had a second brother , Thomas , and a younger sister , Mary . Their father , a carpenter , died while Sheppard was young , and his sister died two years later . 
 Unable to support her family without her husband 's income , Jack 's mother sent him to Mr Garrett 's School , a workhouse near St Helen 's Bishopsgate , when he was six years old . Sheppard was sent out as a parish apprentice to a cane @-@ chair maker , taking a settlement of 20 shillings , but his new master soon died . He was sent out to a second cane @-@ chair maker , but Sheppard was treated badly . Finally , when Sheppard was 10 , he went to work as a shop @-@ boy for William Kneebone , a wool draper with a shop on the Strand . Sheppard 's mother had been working for Kneebone since her husband 's death . Kneebone taught Sheppard to read and write and apprenticed him to a carpenter , Owen Wood , in Wych Street , off Drury Lane in Covent Garden . Sheppard signed his seven @-@ year indenture on 2 April 1717 . 
 By 1722 , Sheppard was showing great promise as a carpenter . Aged 20 , he was a small man , only 5 ' 4 " ( 1 @.@ 63 m ) and lightly built , but deceptively strong . He had a pale face with large , dark eyes , a wide mouth and a quick smile . Despite a slight stutter , his wit made him popular in the taverns of Drury Lane . He served five unblemished years of his apprenticeship but then began to be led into crime . 
 Joseph Hayne , a button @-@ moulder who owned a shop nearby , also ran a tavern named the Black Lion off Drury Lane , which he encouraged the local apprentices to frequent . The Black Lion was visited by criminals such as Joseph " Blueskin " Blake , Sheppard 's future partner in crime , and self @-@ proclaimed " Thief @-@ Taker General " Jonathan Wild , secretly the linchpin of a criminal empire across London and later Sheppard 's implacable enemy . 
 According to Sheppard 's autobiography , he had been an innocent until going to Hayne 's tavern , but there began an attachment to strong drink and the affections of Elizabeth Lyon , a prostitute also known as Edgworth Bess ( or Edgeworth Bess ) from her place of birth at Edgeworth in Middlesex . In his History , Defoe records that Bess was " a main lodestone in attracting of him up to this Eminence of Guilt . " Such , Sheppard claimed , was the source of his later ruin . Peter <unk> offers a different view : that Sheppard 's sudden transformation was a liberation from the dull drudgery of indentured labour and that he progressed from pious servitude to self @-@ confident rebellion and <unk> . 
 = = Criminal career = = 
 Sheppard threw himself into a hedonistic whirl of drinking and whoring . Inevitably , his carpentry suffered , and he became disobedient to his master . With Lyon 's encouragement , Sheppard took to crime in order to complement his legitimate wages . His first recorded theft was in Spring 1723 , when he engaged in petty shoplifting , stealing two silver spoons while on an errand for his master to Rummer Tavern in Charing Cross . Sheppard 's misdeeds went undetected , and he moved on to larger crimes , often stealing goods from the houses where he was working . Finally , he quit the employ of his master on 2 August 1723 , with less than two years of his apprenticeship left , although he continued to work as a journeyman carpenter . He was not suspected of the crimes , and progressed to burglary , falling in with criminals in Jonathan Wild 's gang . 
 He moved to Fulham , living as man and wife with Lyon at Parsons Green , before moving to Piccadilly . When Lyon was arrested and imprisoned at St Giles 's Roundhouse , the beadle , a Mr Brown , refused to let Sheppard visit , so he broke in and took her away . 
 = = = Arrested and escaped twice = = = 
 Sheppard was first arrested after a burglary he committed with his brother , Tom , and his mistress , Lyon , in Clare Market on 5 February 1724 . Tom , also a carpenter , had already been convicted once for stealing tools from his master the previous autumn and burned in the hand . Tom was arrested again on 24 April 1724 . Afraid that he would be hanged this time , Tom informed on Jack , and a warrant was issued for Jack 's arrest . 
 Jonathan Wild was aware of Sheppard 's thefts , as Sheppard had fenced some stolen goods through one of Wild 's men , William Field . Wild asked another of his men , James Sykes ( known as " Hell and Fury " ) to challenge Sheppard to a game of skittles at Redgate 's public house near Seven Dials . Sykes betrayed Sheppard to a Mr Price , a constable from the parish of St Giles , to gather the usual £ 40 reward for giving information leading to the conviction of a felon . The magistrate , Justice Parry , had Sheppard imprisoned overnight on the top floor of St Giles 's Roundhouse pending further questioning , but Sheppard escaped within three hours by breaking through the timber ceiling and lowering himself to the ground with a rope fashioned from bedclothes . Still wearing irons , Sheppard coolly joined the crowd that had been attracted by the sounds of him breaking out . He distracted their attention by pointing to the shadows on the roof and shouting that he could see the escapee , and then swiftly departed . 
 On 19 May 1724 , Sheppard was arrested for a second time , caught in the act of picking a pocket in Leicester Fields ( near present @-@ day Leicester Square ) . He was detained overnight in St Ann 's Roundhouse in Soho and visited there the next day by Lyon ; she was recognised as his wife and locked in a cell with him . They appeared before Justice Walters , who sent them to the New Prison in Clerkenwell , but they escaped from their cell , known as the Newgate Ward , within a matter of days . By 25 May , Whitsun Monday , Sheppard and Lyon had filed through their manacles ; they removed a bar from the window and used their knotted bed @-@ clothes to descend to ground level . Finding themselves in the yard of the neighbouring bridewell , they clambered over the 22 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) prison gate to freedom . This feat was widely publicised , not least because Sheppard was only a small man , and Lyon was a large , buxom woman . 
 = = = Third arrest , trial , and third escape = = = 
 Sheppard 's thieving abilities were admired by Jonathan Wild . Wild demanded that Sheppard surrender his stolen goods for Wild to fence , and so take the greater profits , but Sheppard refused . He began to work with Joseph " Blueskin " Blake , and they burgled Sheppard 's former master , William Kneebone , on Sunday 12 July 1724 . Wild could not permit Sheppard to continue outside his control and began to seek Sheppard 's arrest . Unfortunately for Sheppard , his fence , William Field , was one of Wild 's men . After Sheppard had a brief foray with Blueskin as highwaymen on the Hampstead Road on Sunday 19 July and Monday 20 July , Field informed on Sheppard to Wild . Wild believed Lyon would know Sheppard 's whereabouts , so he plied her with drinks at a brandy shop near Temple Bar until she betrayed him . Sheppard was arrested a third time at Blueskin 's mother 's brandy shop in Rosemary Lane , east of the Tower of London ( later renamed Royal Mint Street ) , on 23 July by Wild 's henchman , Quilt Arnold . 
 Sheppard was imprisoned in Newgate Prison pending his trial at the next Assize of oyer and terminer . He was prosecuted on three charges of theft at the Old Bailey , but was acquitted on the first two due to lack of evidence . Kneebone , Wild and Field gave evidence against him on the third charge , the burglary of Kneebone 's house . He was convicted on 12 August , the case " being plainly prov 'd " , and sentenced to death . On Monday 31 August , the very day when the death warrant arrived from the court in Windsor setting Friday 4 September as the date for his execution , Sheppard escaped . Having loosened an iron bar in a window used when talking to visitors , he was visited by Lyon and Poll <unk> , who distracted the guards while he removed the bar . His slight build enabled him to climb through the resulting gap in the grille , and he was smuggled out of Newgate in women 's clothing that his visitors had brought him . He took a coach to Blackfriars Stairs , a boat up the River Thames to the horse ferry in Westminster , near the warehouse where he hid his stolen goods , and made good his escape . 
 = = = Fourth arrest and final escape = = = 
 By this point , Sheppard was a working class hero ( being a cockney , non @-@ violent , and handsome , and seemingly able to escape punishment for his crimes at will ) . He spent a few days out of London , visiting a friend 's family in Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire , but was soon back in town . He evaded capture by Wild and his men but was arrested again on 9 September by a posse from Newgate as he hid out on Finchley Common , and returned to the condemned cell at Newgate . His fame had increased with each escape , and he was visited in prison by the great , the good and the curious . His plans to escape in September were thwarted twice when the guards found files and other tools in his cell , and he was transferred to a strong @-@ room in Newgate known as the " Castle " , clapped in leg irons , and chained to two metal staples in the floor to prevent further escape attempts . After demonstrating to his gaolers that these measures were insufficient , by showing them how he could use a small nail to unlock the horse padlock at will , he was bound more tightly and handcuffed . In his History , Defoe reports that Sheppard made light of his predicament , joking that " I am the Sheppard , and all the <unk> in the Town are my Flock , and I cannot stir into the Country , but they are all at my Heels <unk> after me " . 
 Meanwhile , " Blueskin " Blake was arrested by Wild and his men on Friday 9 October , and Tom , Jack 's brother , was transported for robbery on Saturday 10 October 1724 . New court sessions began on Wednesday 14 October , and Blueskin was tried on Thursday 15 October , with Field and Wild again giving evidence . Their accounts were not consistent with the evidence that they gave at Sheppard 's trial , but Blueskin was convicted anyway . Enraged , Blueskin attacked Wild in the courtroom , slashing his throat with a pocket @-@ knife and causing an uproar . Wild was lucky to survive , and his grip over his criminal empire started to slip while he recuperated . 
 Taking advantage of the disturbance , which spread to Newgate Prison next door and continued into the night , Sheppard escaped for the fourth time . He unlocked his handcuffs and removed the chains . Still encumbered by his leg irons , he attempted to climb up the chimney , but his path was blocked by an iron bar set into the brickwork . He removed the bar and used it to break through the ceiling into the " Red Room " above the " Castle " , a room which had last been used some seven years before to confine aristocratic Jacobite prisoners after the Battle of Preston . Still wearing his leg irons as night fell , he then broke through six barred doors into the prison chapel , then to the roof of Newgate , 60 feet ( 20 m ) above the ground . He went back down to his cell to get a blanket , then back to the roof of the prison , and used the blanket to reach the roof of an adjacent house , owned by William Bird , a turner . He broke into Bird 's house , and went down the stairs and out into the street at around midnight without disturbing the occupants . Escaping through the streets to the north and west , Sheppard hid in a cowshed in Tottenham ( near modern Tottenham Court Road ) . Spotted by the barn 's owner , Sheppard told him that he had escaped from Bridewell Prison , having been imprisoned there for failing to support a ( nonexistent ) bastard son . His leg irons remained in place for several days until he persuaded a passing shoemaker to accept the considerable sum of 20 shillings to bring a blacksmith 's tools and help him remove them , telling him the same tale . His manacles and leg irons were later recovered in the rooms of Kate Cook , one of Sheppard 's mistresses . This escape astonished everyone . Daniel Defoe , working as a journalist , wrote an account for John Applebee , The History of the Remarkable Life of John Sheppard . In his History , Defoe reports the belief in Newgate that the Devil came in person to assist Sheppard 's escape . 
 = = = Final capture = = = 
 Sheppard 's final period of liberty lasted just two weeks . He disguised himself as a beggar and returned to the city . He broke into the Rawlins brothers ' pawnbroker 's shop in Drury Lane on the night of 29 October 1724 , taking a black silk suit , a silver sword , rings , watches , a wig , and other items . He dressed himself as a dandy gentleman and used the proceeds to spend a day and the following evening on the tiles with two mistresses . He was arrested a final time in the early morning on 1 November , blind drunk , " in a handsome Suit of Black , with a Diamond Ring and a Cornelian ring on his Finger , and a fine Light Tye <unk> " . 
 This time , Sheppard was placed in the Middle Stone Room , in the centre of Newgate next to the " Castle " , where he could be observed at all times . He was also loaded with 300 pounds of iron weights . He was so celebrated that the gaolers charged high society visitors four shillings to see him , and the King 's painter James Thornhill painted his portrait . Several prominent people sent a petition to King George I , begging for his sentence of death to be commuted to transportation . " The Concourse of People of tolerable Fashion to see him was exceeding Great , he was always <unk> and Pleasant to a Degree , as turning almost everything as was said onto a Jest and <unk> . " To a Reverend <unk> who visited him , he said , according to Defoe , " One file 's worth all the Bibles in the World " . 
 Sheppard came before Mr Justice Powis in the Court of King 's Bench at Westminster Hall on 10 November . He was offered the chance to have his sentence reduced by informing on his associates , but he scorned the offer , and the death sentence was confirmed . The next day , Blueskin was hanged , and Sheppard was moved to the condemned cell . 
 = = Execution = = 
 The following Monday , 16 November , Sheppard was taken to the gallows at Tyburn to be hanged . He planned one more escape , but his pen @-@ knife , intended to cut the ropes binding him on the way to the gallows , was found by a prison warder shortly before he left Newgate for the last time . 
 A joyous procession passed through the streets of London , with Sheppard 's cart drawn along Holborn and Oxford Street accompanied by a mounted City Marshal and liveried Javelin Men . The occasion was as much as anything a celebration of Sheppard 's life , attended by crowds of up to 200 @,@ 000 ( one third of London 's population ) . The procession halted at the City of Oxford tavern on Oxford Street , where Sheppard drank a pint of sack . A carnival atmosphere pervaded Tyburn , where his " official " autobiography , published by Applebee and probably ghostwritten by Defoe , was on sale . Sheppard handed " a paper to someone as he mounted the scaffold " , perhaps as a symbolic endorsement of the account in the " Narrative " . His slight build had aided his previous prison escapes , but it condemned him to a slow death by strangulation by the hangman 's noose . After hanging for the prescribed 15 minutes , his body was cut down . The crowd pressed forward to stop his body from being removed , fearing dissection ; their actions inadvertently prevented Sheppard 's friends from implementing a plan to take his body to a doctor in an attempt to revive him . His badly mauled remains were recovered later and buried in the churchyard of St Martin 's @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Fields that evening . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 There was a spectacular public reaction to Sheppard 's deeds . He was even cited ( favourably ) as an example in newspapers , pamphlets , broadsheets , and ballads were all devoted to his amazing exploits , and his story was adapted for the stage almost immediately . Harlequin Sheppard , a pantomime by one John Thurmond ( subtitled " A night scene in grotesque characters " ) , opened at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane on Saturday 28 November , only two weeks after Sheppard 's hanging . In a famous contemporary sermon , a London preacher drew on Sheppard 's popular escapes as a way of holding his congregation 's attention : 
 The account of his life remained well @-@ known through the Newgate Calendar , and a three @-@ act farce was published but never produced , but , mixed with songs , it became The Quaker 's Opera , later performed at Bartholomew Fair . An imagined dialogue between Jack Sheppard and Julius Caesar was published in the British Journal on 4 December 1724 , in which Sheppard favourably compares his virtues and exploits to those of Caesar . 
 Perhaps the most prominent play based on Sheppard 's life is John Gay 's The Beggar 's Opera ( 1728 ) . Sheppard was the inspiration for the figure of Macheath ; his nemesis , <unk> , is based on Jonathan Wild . The play was spectacularly popular , restoring the fortune that Gay had lost in the South Sea Bubble , and was produced regularly for over 100 years . An unperformed but published play The Prison @-@ Breaker was turned into The Quaker 's Opera ( in imitation of The Beggar 's Opera ) and performed at Bartholomew Fair in 1725 and 1728 . Two centuries later The Beggar 's Opera was the basis for The Threepenny Opera of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill ( 1928 ) . 
 Sheppard 's tale may have been an inspiration for William Hogarth 's 1747 series of 12 engravings , Industry and Idleness , which shows the parallel descent of an apprentice , Tom Idle , into crime and eventually to the gallows , beside the rise of his fellow apprentice , Francis Goodchild , who marries his master 's daughter and takes over his business , becoming wealthy as a result , eventually emulating Dick Whittington to become Lord Mayor of London . 
 Sheppard 's tale was revived in the first half of the 19th century . A melodrama , Jack Sheppard , The <unk> , or London in 1724 , by W.T. Moncrieff was published in 1825 . More successful was William Harrison Ainsworth 's third novel , entitled Jack Sheppard , which was originally published in Bentley 's Miscellany from January 1839 with illustrations by George Cruikshank , overlapping with the final episodes of Charles Dickens ' Oliver Twist . An archetypal Newgate novel , it generally remains close to the facts of Sheppard 's life , but portrays him as a swashbuckling hero . Like Hogarth 's prints , the novel pairs the descent of the " idle " apprentice into crime with the rise of a typical melodramatic character , Thames Darrell , a foundling of aristocratic birth who defeats his evil uncle to recover his fortune . Cruikshank 's images perfectly complemented Ainsworth 's tale — Thackeray wrote that " ... Mr Cruickshank really created the tale , and that Mr Ainsworth , as it were , only put words to it . " The novel quickly became very popular : it was published in book form later that year , before the serialised version was completed , and even outsold early editions of Oliver Twist . Ainsworth 's novel was adapted into a successful play by John Buckstone in October 1839 at the Adelphi Theatre starring ( strangely enough ) Mary Anne Keeley ; indeed , it seems likely that Cruikshank 's illustrations were deliberately created in a form that were informed by , and would be easy to repeat as , tableaux on stage . It has been described as the " exemplary climax " of " the pictorial novel dramatized pictorially " . 
 The story generated a form of cultural mania , embellished by pamphlets , prints , cartoons , plays and souvenirs , not repeated until George du Maurier 's Trilby in 1895 . By early 1840 , a cant song from Buckstone 's play , " Nix My Dolly , Pals , Fake Away " was reported to be " deafening us in the streets " . Public alarm at the possibility that young people would emulate Sheppard 's behaviour led the Lord Chamberlain to ban , at least in London , the licensing of any plays with " Jack Sheppard " in the title for forty years . The fear may not have been entirely unfounded : <unk> , the valet of Lord William Russell , claimed in one of his several confessions that the book had inspired him to murder his master . Frank and Jesse James wrote letters to the Kansas City Star signed " Jack Sheppard " . Nevertheless , a number of burlesques of the story were written after the ban was lifted , including a popular Gaiety Theatre , London piece called Little Jack Sheppard ( 1885 – 86 ) by Henry Pottinger Stephens and W. Yardley , with music by Meyer Lutz and others . 
 The Sheppard story has been revived several times in the 20th century , including three silent movies , The <unk> Escape of Jack Sheppard ( 1900 ) , Robbery of the Mail Coach ( 1903 ) and Jack Sheppard ( 1923 ) ; a book , The Road to Tyburn , by Christopher Hibbert ( 1957 ) ; a British costume drama , Where 's Jack ? , directed by James Clavell , with Tommy Steele in the title role ( 1969 ) ; an unrealised film project of <unk> Productions in 2000 , Jack Sheppard and Jonathan Wild , for which Benjamin Ross , who would have been director , co @-@ wrote the screenplay with John Preston , with Tobey Maguire and Harvey Keitel slated for the main parts ; a 2002 television drama , Invitation to a Hanging ; and a series of novels by Neal Stephenson collectively known as , The Baroque Cycle ( 2003 , 2004 ) , in which the character Jack Shaftoe was partly inspired by events from the life of Jack Sheppard . 
 The reasons for the lasting legacy of Jack Sheppard 's exploits in the popular imagination have been addressed by Peter <unk> , who suggests that Sheppard 's legend was rooted in the prospect of <unk> , of escape from what Michel Foucault in Folie et <unk> called the grand <unk> ( Great Confinement ) , in which " unreasonable " members of the population were locked away and institutionalised . The laws levelled at Sheppard and similar working class criminals were a means of disciplining a potentially rebellious multitude into accepting increasingly harsh property laws . A nineteenth @-@ century view on the Jack Sheppard phenomenon was offered by Charles Mackay in Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds :

Convinced that it was stolen , he begins to have a panic attack , but is calmed down by Eddy ( Tony Sampson ) . The two then go to Ed 's ( Matt Hill ) house . Not long after they arrive , Ed 's younger sister Sarah ( Janyse Jaud ) comes barging into his room , accusing him of stealing her doll . Ed denies having done so , and Eddy concludes that there is a " serial toucher " on the loose . The Eds spread the word to the other cul @-@ de @-@ sac children , who offer them money if they catch the thief . 
 The three then form a plan , which has Ed sitting alone on a bench in the playground with a " Don 't Touch ! " sign around his neck . Jonny ( David Paul Grove ) soon walks by , carrying his imaginary friend Plank , who is a board of wood . Impressed with Ed 's hair cut , Jonny ignores the sign and rubs Plank against Ed 's head . Eddy and Double Dee then jump out from behind a nearby bush and capture Jonny , accusing him of being the serial toucher . Eddy interrogates Jonny and Plank after tying them to chairs in Double Dee 's garage and hooking them up to a homemade lie detector . However , when they give him no answers , he resorts to using <unk> water torture on Plank . This makes Jonny need to use the bathroom and in his desperation , he falsely confesses to the crime . The Eds then collect their money and punish Jonny by trapping him in a tire . 
 While on their way to buy jawbreakers at the candy store , the Eds are stopped by Sarah who claims to have found her doll under her bed . Double Dee then confesses that he recently found his magnifying glass as well , proving that there never actually was a serial toucher . Despite this revelation , the Eds still decide to spend the money , without freeing Jonny . However , while they are enjoying their jawbreakers , Sarah rolls the tire in which Jonny is trapped in down a hill , knocking the three over . The jawbreakers fly out of their mouths and roll down the street , leaving the Eds to chase after them .

 Setting out on Double Dee 's monthly insect expedition , the Eds venture into a forest . While Double Dee admires the bounty of nature , Eddy discovers a giant spiderweb and fearfully suggests that they leave . His friends are intrigued by its enormous size however , and Ed starts bouncing on the web . Suddenly , nearby voices start chanting the Eds ' names . Double Dee and Eddy urge Ed to climb down from the web , but he is unable to break free on his own . After his friends manage to pull him down , the three of them frantically try to run away . Before they are able to escape the forest though , they fall into a muddy swamp and are surrounded by three seemingly ominous figures . 
 Some time later , the Eds wake up in a trailer home , where three girls are staring down at them . The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes , which the girls inform them each belong to one of their three respective dads . Explaining that they are new to the area , the girls introduce themselves as Lee ( Janyse Jaud ) , Marie ( Kathleen Barr ) and May Kanker ( Erin Fitzgerald ) . The Eds begin to offer their own introductions , but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys ' names . As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds , Double Dee anxiously proposes that the three of them leave . However , Eddy stops him , insisting that they stay at least for the free food . Looking around , the boys notice drawings of themselves , each paired with one the Kankers : Ed with May , Double Dee with Marie , and Eddy with Lee . Although left unsettled by this discovery , they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax , as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up . 
 When the Kankers return , they make multiple attempts to garner the Eds ' attention , but the boys , engrossed with what they are watching on the T.V. , ignore them . Angry , and feeling unappreciated , the Kankers start bossing the Eds around , forcing them to clean up the house . Eddy quickly grows annoyed with the situation though , and loses his temper with the Kankers , sending them crying into their room . In a moment of regret , he attempts to apologize , but is told by May to leave and to never return . The Eds gladly accept this , but upon opening the front door , they find the Kankers blocking their way , holding self @-@ made dolls styled to look like the Eds . Dubbing the dolls " Eddy Junior " , " Ed Junior " and " Double Dee Junior " , the Kankers try to guilt the Eds into staying . However , this only causes the boys to flee in terror . The Kankers look after the Eds longingly as they go and declare their love for them . 
 = = Production = = 
 As an animator of various Hanna @-@ Barbera children 's cartoons , Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci was bothered by people who thought that animation was only for children , prompting him to produce edgy adult works such as Lupo the Butcher and The Brothers Grunt . Antonucci was later dared to produce a children 's cartoon and accepted the challenge . Antonucci drew the Eds while designing a commercial . Impressed , he spent months designing the show and then faxed a one @-@ page concept sheet to Cartoon Network ( CN ) and Nickelodeon in 1996 . Both responded quickly with high interest , but demanded creative control , to which Antonucci refused . After CN agreed to let Antonucci have creative control , a deal was made that his studio , a.k.a. Cartoon , would produce the series . The show entered production in 1997 , making it Cartoon Network 's first original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Hanna @-@ Barbera , as well as the first to by @-@ pass a seven @-@ minute short . 
 An advocate of hand @-@ drawn animation , Antonucci wanted Ed , Edd n Eddy to be produced in a way akin to cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s . Consequently , the series was the last to use cel animation ; the cels were shipped to Korea for creation of the initial animation , and then later edited back at a.k.a. Cartoon . However , when the negatives arrived back from Korea , they were so dirty , a run through digital noise reduction ( <unk> ) , technology used to clean up dirt and grain digitally as film is transferred to tape , was unavoidable . Antonucci referred to it as " a necessary evil " , because it caused large damage to the animation . Upon seeing the <unk> effects on the pilot , the percentage of <unk> was <unk> to purify the colors and avoid affecting the image as much as possible . 
 The episode was directed by Antonucci , who also co @-@ wrote the episodes , " The Ed @-@ touchables " with Jono Howard and " Nagged to Ed " with Howard and Mike Kubat . Both episodes were storyboarded by Scott Underwood , Leah Waldron , James Wootton and Bill <unk> . The score was composed by Patric Caird , who went on to compose the music for the rest of the series . The series was initially scheduled to premiere November 7 , 1998 but was moved to November 16 , and then finally to January 4 , 1999 due to minor post @-@ production delays . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Ed , Edd n Eddy was one of Cartoon Network 's top @-@ rated shows ever since its premiere , particularly with boys . While Ed , Edd n Eddy went on to garner largely positive reviews , the pilot was met with mixed reactions . Some reviewers were unenthusiastic about the episode . The Hollywood Reporter said the animation was " primitive " and " simplistic " and could " only be described as ugly . " He further criticised the characters as " grim and toothy " and the voice work as " glowering " . The Times @-@ Picayune wrote : " the funniest thing about Ed , Edd and Eddy is the title . " Terrence Briggs of Animation World Magazine wrote a scathing review , considering Ed , Edd n Eddy the worst Cartoon Network show up to that point and criticising the episodes as " empty adventures " of pure " filler " with characters that were " products from the school of acid @-@ trip caricature " . 
 However , other reviews were positive . After Briggs ' review was published , a large number of letters supportive of the show were sent to the magazine , prompting it to " take a second look " at the show , with Matt Shumway and Lamont Wayne writing a much more positive review , calling it " a fresh show with very different approaches " . The Sarasota Herald @-@ Tribune was highly positive of the show and felt that the show 's lively animation and slapstick humor recalled " the delight of earlier cartoon era " , writing : " In times of old , cartoon characters had eyes that bugged out when they drank something unpleasant , legs that became whirling circles when they ran and bodies that flattened into pancakes when they crashed into slammed doors . Well , they 're ba @-@ a @-@ a @-@ ck . " The Herald Sun considered Ed , Edd n Eddy an animated mixture of well @-@ known classic TV shows , noting " just imagine Dexter in his laboratory working on some new project for the Cartoon Network when he tunes into The Little Rascals and The Three Stooges . Alfalfa , Spanky , Moe and Curly really excite the wunderkind who decides to extract some DNA from the old TV legends . Into the test tubes with the DNA ... add a little animation and Dexter has Ed , Edd N Eddy " . 
 The pilot was released as part of Ed , Edd n Eddy : The Complete First Season DVD on October 10 , 2006 , which can be purchased on Amazon.com and the Cartoon Network Shop . It is also available for purchase on the iTunes Store , where it can be bought separately , or as a part of season 1 . It can also be streamed through Netflix .

 Chastain was born on March 24 , 1977 , in a small town near Sonoma , California . Her father , Michael Monasterio , was a rock musician , and her mother Jerri <unk> ( née Chastain ) , is a vegan chef . Her parents were both teenagers when she was born . Chastain is reluctant to publicly discuss this aspect of her childhood ; she was estranged from Monasterio and has said that no father is listed on her birth certificate . She had a younger sister , Juliet , from her mother 's relationship with Monasterio , but following years of drug abuse , Juliet committed suicide in 2003 . Chastain has a half @-@ brother from her mother 's side and two half @-@ sisters from her father 's side . Chastain was raised in Sacramento , California , by her mother and stepfather , Michael <unk> , a fireman . She considers her stepfather to be " one of the greatest people " she knows and has said that he was the first person to make her feel secure . She shares a close bond with her maternal grandmother , Marilyn , whom she credits as someone who " always believed in me " . Speaking about her childhood , Chastain has said : 
 " I didn 't grow up with a lot of money , and we were evicted a couple times when I was a child . One time , I even came home from school and there was someone locking our doors . And he felt super guilty , and he asked me , ' do you want to go in and grab some things ? ' I always had this fear of being homeless . I decided to become an actor [ ... ] because I grew up without money , so I knew I could live without money . But I always had this thing of , I 'm not going to be able to pay my rent . " 
 As a student at the El Camino Fundamental High School in Sacramento , Chastain struggled academically . She was a loner and considered herself a misfit in school , eventually finding an outlet in the performing arts . She said , " I used to cut school to read Shakespeare , not to make out in the park " . She first developed an interest in acting at the age of seven , after her grandmother took her to a production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat . Chastain would regularly put up amateur shows with other children , and considered herself to be their " artistic director " . With too many absences during her senior year in school , Chastain did not qualify for graduation , but eventually obtained an adult diploma . She later attended Sacramento City College from 1996 to 1997 , during which she was a member of their debate team . 
 In 1998 , Chastain made her professional stage debut as Juliet in a production of Romeo and Juliet staged by <unk> , a company in the San Francisco Bay Area . The production led her to audition for the Juilliard School in New York City , where she was soon accepted and granted a scholarship funded by the actor Robin Williams . In her first year at the school , Chastain described herself as " a wreck of anxiety " ; she constantly worried about being dropped from the program and would spend most of her time reading and watching movies . She later remarked that a successful production of The Seagull , in which she participated during her second year , helped build her confidence . She graduated from the school with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 2003 .

 Shortly before graduating from Juilliard , Chastain attended an event for final @-@ year students in Los Angeles , where she was signed on for a talent holding deal by the television producer John Wells . She relocated to California , taking up residence in Venice Beach , and started auditioning for jobs . She initially found the process difficult , remarking that " being a redhead and not having very conventionally modern looks , it was confusing for people and they didn 't know exactly where to put me . " In her television debut , The WB network 's 2004 pilot remake of the 1960s gothic soap opera Dark Shadows , she was cast as Carolyn Stoddard . Directed by P. J. Hogan , the pilot did not perform well and the series was eventually not picked up for broadcast . Later that year , she appeared as a guest performer on the medical drama series ER , playing a woman she described as " psychotic " , which led to her finding a niche in portraying neurotic roles . She said , " I played a lot of girls who had something off . Maybe they 'd been the victim of some horrible accident . Or they were crazy . " She went on to appear in such roles in a few other television series from 2004 – 07 , including Veronica Mars ( 2004 ) , Close to Home ( 2006 ) and Law & Order : Trial By Jury ( 2005 – 06 ) . 
 In 2004 , Chastain took on the role of Anya in a Williamstown Theatre Festival production of The Cherry Orchard in Massachusetts , in which she starred with Michelle Williams . Also that year , she worked with Playwrights Horizons on a production of Rodney 's Wife as the daughter of a troubled middle @-@ aged film actor . Her performance was not well received by the critic Ben Brantley of The New York Times , who thought that she " somehow seems to keep losing color as the evening progresses " . While working on the play , she was recommended by her director Richard Nelson to Al Pacino , who was looking for an actress to star in his production of Salome . Written by Oscar Wilde , Salome tells the tragic story of its titular character 's sexual exploration . Despite written as a 16 @-@ year old , Chastain , who was close to 30 then , was cast in the lead . The play was staged in 2006 at the Wadsworth Theatre in Los Angeles , and Chastain later remarked that it helped bring her to the attention of several casting directors . However , writing for Variety , the critic Steven Oxman criticized her portrayal in it : " Chastain is so ill @-@ at @-@ ease with Salome , not quite certain whether she ’ s a capable seductress or a whiny , wealthy brat ; she doesn ’ t flesh out either choice " . 
 Chastain made her film debut in 2008 as the titular character in Dan Ireland 's drama Jolene , based on a short story by E. L. Doctorow which was inspired by Dolly Parton 's song " Jolene " . It follows the life of a sexually abused teenager over the course of a decade . While the drama received mixed reviews , Chastain 's performance was praised by a reviewer for the New York Observer , who remarked that she " not only holds her own corner of every scene , she 's the only thing you want to watch " . Chastain won a Best Actress award at the Seattle International Film Festival . The following year , Chastain had a minor role in Stolen ( 2009 ) , a mystery @-@ thriller film , which was criticized by critics and only received a limited theatrical release . Also in 2009 , she played the part of Desdemona in The Public Theatre production of Shakespeare 's tragedy Othello , co @-@ starring John Ortiz and Phillip Seymour Hoffman . Writing for The New Yorker , Hilton Als commended Chastain for finding " a beautiful maternal depth in Desdemona " . 
 The year 2010 saw Chastain star in John Madden 's dramatic thriller The Debt , in which she portrayed a young Mossad agent sent to East Berlin in the 1960s to capture a former Nazi doctor who carried out medical experiments in concentration camps . Chastain shared her role with Helen Mirren — both actresses portraying the character at different phases of her life . They worked together before filming to perfect the voice and mannerisms of the character and make them consistent . In addition , Chastain took classes in German and <unk> <unk> , and studied books about Josef Mengele and Mossad history . William Thomas of Empire termed the film a " smart , tense , well @-@ acted thriller " and noted that Chastain " pulses with strength and vulnerability " in her part . Chastain also appeared in an episode of the British television series Agatha Christie 's Poirot , based on Christie 's 1934 novel Murder on the Orient Express , which marked her final guest star role in television . 
 = = = 2011 : Breakthrough = = = 
 After struggling for a breakthrough in film for a number of years , in 2011 Chastain had six film releases , gaining widespread acclaim and recognition for her roles in several of them . The first of these roles was in Jeff Nichols ' Take Shelter , a drama about a troubled father ( Michael Shannon ) who tries to protect his family ( Chastain played his wife ) from an impending storm . It was screened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival , and the critic Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph thought that Chastain 's supporting part aided the narrative , writing that she " backs [ Shannon ] up with luminous concern " . She received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination for the film . 
 The 61st Berlin International Film Festival saw the release of Coriolanus , an adaptation of Shakespeare 's tragedy of the same name from actor @-@ director Ralph Fiennes , in which Chastain played <unk> . Her next role was opposite Brad Pitt , as the loving mother of three children in Terrence Malick 's experimental drama The Tree of Life , which she had filmed in 2008 . Chastain signed on to the film without receiving a traditional screenplay from Malick , and she improvised on several scenes and dialogues with Pitt . She considered her part to be " the embodiment of grace and the spirit world " and in preparation , she practiced meditation , studied paintings of the Madonna , and read poems by Thomas Aquinas . Following several delays in release , the film premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival to a polarized reception from the audience , although it was praised by critics and won the Palme d 'Or . Justin Chang of Variety termed the film a " hymn to the glory of creation , an exploratory , often mystifying [ ... ] poem " and credited Chastain for playing her part with " heartrending vulnerability " . 
 Chastain 's biggest success of the year came with the comedy @-@ drama The Help , co @-@ starring Viola Davis , Octavia Spencer and Emma Stone , which was based on Kathryn Stockett 's novel of the same name . Chastain played Celia Foote , an aspiring socialite in 1960s Jackson , Mississippi , who develops a friendship with her black maid ( Spencer ) . She was drawn to her character 's anti @-@ racist stand and connected with her " zest and love for life " ; in preparation , she watched the films of Marilyn Monroe and researched on the history of Sugar Ditch , Tennessee , where her character was raised . The Help earned $ 216 million at the box office to become Chastain 's most widely seen film to that point . Manohla Dargis of The New York Times praised the chemistry between Chastain and Spencer and Roger Ebert commended her for being " unaffected and infectious in her performance " . The ensemble of The Help won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Cast and Chastain received her first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress , in addition to a BAFTA , Golden Globe and SAG nomination in the same category , all of which she lost to Spencer . 
 Chastain 's final two roles of the year were in Wilde Salomé , a documentary based on her play Salome , and the critically panned crime @-@ thriller Texas Killing Fields . The latter , co @-@ starring Sam Worthington and Jeffrey Dean Morgan , was a partly fictionalized version of the events in the killing fields of Texas , in which she played a homicide detective . Los Angeles Times ' Betsy Sharkey praised Chastain 's polished Texas drawl , but criticized the film , writing that " as good as [ the cast ] can be [ ... ] they just can 't quite pull it off " . Chastain 's work in 2011 , especially in The Help , Take Shelter and The Tree of Life , gained her awards from several critics organizations , including the New York Film Critics Circle , the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association .

 Two of Chastain 's films in 2012 premiered at the 65th Cannes Film Festival — the animated comedy film Madagascar 3 : Europe 's Most Wanted and the crime drama Lawless . In the former , which marked the third installment of the lucrative Madagascar franchise , Chastain voiced the character of a jaguar in an Italian accent . With a worldwide gross of $ 747 million , the film ranks as her highest @-@ grossing release . Lawless , directed by John Hillcoat , was based on Matt <unk> 's prohibition era novel The Wettest County in the World . Chastain played a dancer from Chicago who becomes embroiled in a conflict between three bootlegging brothers ( played by Shia LaBeouf , Tom Hardy and Jason Clarke ) . The film received generally positive reviews from critics , with Richard Corliss finding Chastain to be filled with " poised , seductive gravity " . In an experimental biopic of the author C. K. Williams , entitled The Color of Time ( 2012 ) , directed by the New York University students of actor James Franco , Chastain took on the role of a young Williams ' mother . Originally titled Tar for its premiere at the 2012 Rome Film Festival , the film was renamed for its theatrical release later in 2014 . 
 A short part that Chastain had filmed opposite Ben Affleck in Terrence <unk> 's To the Wonder ( 2012 ) was edited out of the final film , and due to scheduling conflicts , she dropped out of the action films Oblivion and Iron Man 3 ( both 2013 ) . She instead chose to make her Broadway debut in a revival of the 1947 play The Heiress , playing the role of Catherine Sloper , a naive young girl who transforms into a powerful woman . Chastain was initially reticent to accept the role fearing the high anxiety she had faced during her early stage performances . She ultimately agreed to the part after finding a connection to Sloper , saying : " she ’ s painfully uncomfortable and I used to be that " . The production was staged at the Walter Kerr Theatre from November 2012 to February 2013 . Brantley was disappointed with Chastain 's performance , writing that " curiously for an expert film actress , she is guilty here of <unk> the thoughts within . And her delivery of dialogue sometimes has a flatness that I associate with cold readings of scripts . " 
 Kathryn Bigelow 's thriller Zero Dark Thirty marked Chastain 's final film release of 2012 . The film tells a partly fictionalized account of the decade @-@ long manhunt for Al @-@ Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the September 11 attacks . Chastain was cast as Maya , an emotionally hardened CIA intelligence analyst who helped capture Laden . The difficult subject matter made it unpleasant for Chastain to film , and she later considered it as " the worst experience " of her life . She suffered from depression while working and said , " [ one day ] I excused myself , walked off set and burst into tears " . Chastain was unable to meet the undercover agent on whom Maya was based and she relied on screenwriter Mark Boal 's research . Zero Dark Thirty received critical acclaim but was controversial for depicting enhanced interrogation techniques as effectively contributing to the search for Laden . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone reviewed , " Chastain is a marvel . She plays Maya like a gathering storm in an indelible , implosive performance that cuts so deep we can feel her nerve endings . " Roger Ebert made note of Chastain 's versatility , and favorably compared her ability and range to that of actress Meryl Streep . For her performance , Chastain won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama and earned Academy , BAFTA and SAG nominations for Best Actress . 
 Chastain next took on the lead role of a musician who is forced to care for her boyfriend 's troubled nieces in the horror film Mama ( 2013 ) . She was attracted to the idea of playing a woman drastically different from the " perfect mother " roles she had played in Take Shelter and The Tree of Life , and she based her character 's look on the singer Alice Glass . The critic Richard Roeper noted on how different the role was from the ones she had previously played , and described it as " further proof she 's one of the finest actors of her generation " . During the film 's opening weekend in North America , Chastain became one of the few performances to have leading roles in the top two films ( Mama and Zero Dark Thirty ) at the box office . Mama eventually earned $ 146 worldwide . She then starred as the titular character of a depressed woman who separates from her husband ( played by James McAvoy ) following a tragic incident in the drama The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby ( 2013 ) , in which she also served as producer . Initially written by writer @-@ director Ned Benson from the perspective of Rigby 's husband , he wrote a separate version of the story from Rigby 's perspective on the insistence of Chastain . The film was premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival in two parts — Him and Her — and a third part told from both their perspectives — subtitled Them — was released separately . The critic A. O. Scott believed that Chastain " short @-@ circuits conventional distinctions between tough and vulnerable , showing exquisite control even when her character is losing it , and keeping her balance even when the movie pitches and rolls toward melodrama . " However , the film did not find a wide audience .

 Chastain had three film releases in 2014 . She played the eponymous protagonist in Miss Julie , a film adaptation of August Strindberg 's 1888 play of the same name , from director Liv Ullmann . Miss Julie tells the tragic tale of a sexually repressed aristocrat ( Chastain ) who begins an affair with her father 's valet ( played by Colin Farrell ) , and Chastain was attracted to the project due to Ullmann 's feminist take on the subject . Writing for The Hollywood Reporter , David Rooney was disappointed with the picture , writing that despite " nuanced work " from Chastain the adaptation was " a ponderous , stately affair that lacks relevance " . The film received a limited theatrical release and was not widely seen . While filming Miss Julie in Ireland , the script of Christopher Nolan 's science fiction film Interstellar ( 2014 ) was delivered to Chastain . With a production budget of $ 165 million , the high @-@ profile production , co @-@ starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway , was significantly filmed using IMAX cameras . She was cast as McConaughey 's adult daughter , a role she shared with Mackenzie Foy and Ellen Burstyn , and she was drawn to the project for the emotional heft she found in the father @-@ daughter pair . Drew McWeeny of the entertainment website HitFix found the film to be " ambitious and amazing " and took note of how much Chastain stood out in her supporting part . The film earned over $ 675 million worldwide to become Chastain 's highest @-@ grossing live @-@ action film . 
 Chastain 's final release of 2014 was the J. C. <unk> @-@ directed crime drama A Most Violent Year . Set in New York City in 1981 , the year in which the city had the highest crime rate , the film tells the story of a small heating oil company owner ( played by Oscar Isaac ) and his ruthless wife ( Chastain ) . In preparation , Chastain researched on the period and worked with a coach to develop a Brooklyn accent . She collaborated with costume designer Kasia <unk> @-@ <unk> to work on the character 's wardrobe , and reached out to Armani to use their costumes from the era . The San Francisco Chronicle 's Mick LaSalle believed Chastain to be " the embodiment of a nouveau riche New York woman of the era " and Mark Kermode of The Guardian found Chastain to be " terrific as the Lady Macbeth power behind the throne " . She received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination for the film . For her work in 2014 , the Broadcast Film Critics Association honored Chastain with a special achievement award . 
 The year 2015 saw Chastain take on the part of a commander in Ridley Scott 's science fiction film The Martian . Starring Matt Damon as a botanist who is stranded on Mars , the film was based on Andy Weir 's novel of the same name . Chastain met with astronauts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Johnson Space Center , and based her role on Tracy Caldwell Dyson . She spent time with Dyson in Houston and said , " My character is dealing with the guilt of leaving a crew member behind , but she 's still responsible for the lives of five other crew mates . I tried to play her as Tracy would have been in those moments . " With a revenue of over $ 630 million , the film became her second top @-@ grossing film in two years . Also in 2015 , Chastain played a villainous countess who plots with her brother ( played by Tom Hiddleston ) to terrorize his new bride ( played by Mia Wasikowska ) in Guillermo del Toro 's gothic romance Crimson Peak . Despite the character 's misdeeds , Chastain approached the part with empathy , and in preparation read graveyard poetry and watched the films Rebecca ( 1940 ) and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane ? ( 1962 ) . Toro cast her in the film to lend accessibility to a part he considered " psychopathic " , but critic Peter Debruge of Variety found her to " alarmingly miscast " in the role , writing that she " flounders to convey [ her character 's ] vicious insecurity and black @-@ widow ruthlessness " . Conversely , David Sims of Slate magazine praised her for portraying her character 's " jealous intensity to the hilt " .

 After portraying a series of intense roles , Chastain actively looked for a light @-@ hearted part . She found just that in the fantasy film The Huntsman : Winter 's War ( 2016 ) , co @-@ starring Chris Hemsworth , Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt . The film served as both a sequel and a prequel to the 2012 film Snow White and the Huntsman . She was drawn to the idea of playing a female warrior whose abilities were on par with the male lead , but the film generated negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office . Also that year , Chastain launched a production company named Freckle Films , headed by a team consisting exclusively of female executives , which is expected to partner with Maven Pictures to develop the film adaptations of two books . 
 As of July 2016 , Chastain has seven upcoming projects . She has completed work on the drama The Zookeeper 's Wife , an adaptation of the non @-@ fiction book of the same name from the director Niki Caro . Chastain co @-@ stars with Johan <unk> as the real @-@ life zookeepers Jan and Antonina <unk> who saved many human and animal lives during World War II . She has also completed filming for the part of a lobbyist in the gun control thriller Miss Sloane , which reunites her with director John Madden . She is filming for Xavier Dolan 's first English language film , entitled The Death and Life of John F. Donovan , in which she plays a shrewd gossip columnist , alongside an ensemble cast including Kit Harington , Kathy Bates , Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman . In addition , she will feature in three upcoming biographical films — she will star as the country singer Tammy Wynette opposite Josh Brolin 's George Jones in a biopic of Jones , entitled No Show Jones , as the 19th century activist Caroline Weldon , who was an adviser to the Sioux chieftain Sitting Bull in the drama Woman Walks Ahead , and as Molly Bloom , a disgruntled skier who ran a high @-@ profile gambling operation , in Aaron Sorkin 's directorial debut Molly ’ s Game . Chastain is also set to appear in Patrick Brice 's comedy film Plus One , opposite Cecily Strong . 
 = = Personal life and off @-@ screen work = = 
 Despite significant media attention , Chastain remains guarded about her personal life , and chooses not to attend red carpet events with a partner . She considers herself to be a " shy " person , and describing her routine in 2011 , she said , " I walk the dogs , I play the ukulele , I cook . I ’ m not a girl who goes to big parties " . She has cited the actress Isabelle Huppert as an influence on her life for managing a family while also playing " out @-@ there roles " in film . In the 2000s , Chastain was in a long @-@ term relationship with writer @-@ director Ned Benson , but the couple broke up in 2010 . From 2012 onward , she has been in a relationship with Gian Luca Passi de <unk> , an Italian @-@ born executive for the French fashion brand Moncler . As of 2016 , she lives with <unk> in New York City . Chastain is an animal lover and has adopted a rescue dog . She was a <unk> for much of her life , but following health troubles she began practicing veganism . 
 Chastain is a feminist , and has often spoken against the discrimination faced by women and minorities in Hollywood . She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter . Among other issues , she is vocal in her support for equal pay in the workplace : " I think people know , if they ’ re going to hire me I ’ m not going to just be grateful . There have been situations where I have lost movies because I ’ ve said , this is not a fair deal , and I ’ ve walked away . ” In 2013 , Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign , that helps empower veterans of the United States Army , and in 2016 , she became an advisory board member to the organization We Do It Together , which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women . 
 Having suffered through the suicide of her sister , Chastain aims to create awareness on depression , saying , " If I can do anything to help someone move through any darkness that they ’ re in , I ’ m gonna do whatever I can to help " . She supports charitable organizations that promote mental health , and is involved with the non @-@ profit organization To Write Love on Her Arms to help high @-@ school students of alternate sexual and gender identities overcome their insecurities . She was teased as a child for having red hair and freckles and now takes a stand against bullying and body shaming .

 Describing Chastain 's off @-@ screen persona , InStyle magazine published in 2015 that " she ’ s an adult , which isn ’ t always a given in Hollywood . <unk> candid with her answers , she retains a sense of perspective uncommon among her peers and has real opinions " ; in addition , the magazine credited her for being the rare actress who is “ all about the craft ” . Evgenia Peretz , an editor at Vanity Fair considers Chastain to be " the most sensitive and empathetic actor " she has interviewed , and her colleague Jessica Diehl takes note of Chastain 's " timeless elegance " which she thinks is " almost incongruous for the current times " . 
 Chastain specializes in portraying emotionally grueling roles and is drawn towards parts of strong but flawed women . She believes in extensive preparations for a role , and ( in her own words ) she tries to " fill myself up with as much history of the character as I can " . Chastain is unique in being a Hollywood actress who overcame ageism to become a leading lady in her 30s . The critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper have praised Chastain 's versatility , and W magazine credits her for avoiding typecasting . Guillermo del Toro ( who directed her in Crimson Peak ) believes that she is " interested in being chameleonic " and that " no matter how bizarre the situation [ ... ] she ’ s able to bring completely real emotions to the game " . Describing Chastain 's abilities as an actress , Sophie Heawood of The Guardian wrote that " she brings so little ego to the roles she plays , so little of herself , that you go away with no idea who that actress actually was . " Harper 's Bazaar opines that " she goes for total immersion , sinking so deep into character that her face seems to change shape with each one " . Lea Goldman of Marie Claire compares her craft to that of actresses Meryl Streep and Cate Blanchett and believes that her " looks are always an afterthought " . 
 Chastain 's beauty and sex @-@ appeal have been picked up by several sources , including Vogue , who describes Chastain 's physical features as " excessively luscious [ with ] pale Botticelli features wrapped around a bone structure that has a touch of the masculine , right down to the cleft in her chin " . She was named the sexiest vegetarian actress in a poll conducted by PETA in 2012 . From 2012 – 14 she was featured in AskMen 's listing of the most desirable women , and in 2013 she was placed in Maxim 's listing of the 100 hottest women in the world . In 2015 , Glamour magazine ranked her as one of the best @-@ dressed women . Time magazine named Chastain one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012 . Also in 2012 , she was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , and was named the celebrity endorser for a Yves Saint Laurent fragrance called Manifesto . In 2015 , she became the global ambassador for the Swiss jewelry and watchmaking company Piaget SA .

 = Gordon Banks = 
 Gordon Banks , OBE ( born 30 December 1937 ) is a former England international football goalkeeper . He made 628 appearances during a 15 @-@ year career in the Football League , and won 73 caps for his country . Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time , the IFFHS named Banks the second best goalkeeper of the 20th century – after Lev Yashin ( 1st ) and ahead of Dino Zoff ( 3rd ) . He was named FWA Footballer of the Year in 1972 , and was named FIFA Goalkeeper of the Year on six occasions . 
 He joined Chesterfield in March 1953 , and played for the youth team in the 1956 FA Youth Cup final . He made his first team debut in November 1958 , and was sold to Leicester City for £ 7 @,@ 000 in July 1959 . He played in four cup finals for the club , as they were beaten in the 1961 and 1963 FA Cup finals , before winning the League Cup in 1964 and finishing as finalists in 1965 . During this time he established himself as England 's number one goalkeeper , and played every game of the nation 's 1966 World Cup victory . Despite this success , he was dropped by Leicester and sold on to Stoke City for £ 50 @,@ 000 in April 1967 . He made one of the game 's great saves to prevent a Pelé goal in the 1970 World Cup , but was absent due to illness as England were beaten by West Germany at the quarter @-@ final stage . 
 He was Stoke 's goalkeeper in the 1972 League Cup win – the club 's only major honour . He was still Stoke and England 's number one when a car crash in October 1972 cost him both the sight in one eye and his professional career . He did though play in the United States for the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in 1977 and 1978 . He briefly entered management with Telford United , but left the game after he was sacked in December 1980 .

 Banks was born in Sheffield , West Riding of Yorkshire , and brought up in the working class area of Tinsley . The family later moved to the village of <unk> after his father set up a ( then illegal ) betting shop . This brought greater prosperity but also misery , as one day Banks 's disabled brother was mugged for the shop 's daily takings , and died of his injuries some weeks later . He left school in December 1952 , and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant , which helped to build up his upper body strength . He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C. after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match ; the club 's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys . His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare , however a 12 – 2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3 – 1 home defeat , and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh . Still aged 15 , he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier . 
 He was scouted by Chesterfield whilst playing for Millspaugh , and offered a six @-@ game trial in the youth team in March 1953 . He impressed enough in these games to be offered a part @-@ time £ 3 a week contract by manager Teddy Davison in July 1953 . The reserve team were placed in the Central League on account of a powerful club director rather than on merit , and Banks conceded 122 goals in the 1954 – 55 season as the " Spireites " finished in last place with only three victories . Banks was posted to Germany with the Royal Signals on national service , and won the Rhine Cup with his regimental team . He recovered from a fractured elbow to help the Chesterfield youth team to the 1956 final of the FA Youth Cup . There they were beaten 4 – 3 on aggregate by Manchester United 's famous " Busby Babes " – a team that included both Wilf McGuinness and Bobby Charlton . 
 Banks was given his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone , at the expense of long @-@ serving Ron Powell , in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958 . The game ended 2 – 2 , and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the following match , and he missed only three games by the end of the 1958 – 59 season due to injury . With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of , Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch , and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence . Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name , it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies , manager of First Division club Leicester City , bought him from Chesterfield for £ 7 @,@ 000 in July 1959 ; this also meant a wage increase to £ 15 a week . 
 = = = Leicester City = = = 
 Banks faced competition from five other goalkeepers , including 30 @-@ year @-@ old Scotland international John Anderson and 25 @-@ year @-@ old Dave MacLaren . He started the 1959 – 60 season as the reserve team 's goalkeeper , in effect making him the club 's second choice ahead of four of his rivals but behind first team choice MacLaren . He had played four reserve team games when MacLaren picked up an injury and manager Matt Gillies selected Banks for his Leicester debut against Blackpool at Filbert Street on 9 September . The match finished 1 – 1 , with Jackie Mudie 's strike cancelling out Ken Leek 's opener . Banks retained his place for the 2 – 0 defeat against Newcastle United at St James ' Park three days later . With McLaren fit again , Banks was sent back to the reserves but , after the first team conceded 14 goals in the next five games , he was recalled and became the first @-@ choice goalkeeper for the remainder of the season . The defensive record did not improve at first , with Banks conceding six in a heavy defeat to Everton at Goodison Park , but he improved in each match and the " Foxes " settled for a comfortable 12th @-@ place finish . In training , he worked extensively on improving his weaknesses , such as coming for crosses . He put in extra hours during training and came up with practice sessions to improve his skills – this was largely unique in an era where there were no specialized goalkeeping coaches . In the summer , both Anderson and MacLaren departed , leaving Banks as the club 's undisputed number one ahead of a group of understudies . 
 Leicester finished sixth in 1960 – 61 , and managed to beat champions Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane . Yet their greatest accomplishment was in reaching the final of the FA Cup , with Banks conceding only five goals in their nine games on route to the final and keeping three clean sheets in the semi @-@ final and two replays against Sheffield United . Goals from Jimmy Walsh and Ken Leek finally broke the deadlock in the second replay at St Andrew 's . Their opponents in the final at Wembley were Tottenham , who had already won the First Division title by an eight @-@ point margin . Right @-@ back Len Chalmers picked up a severe injury early in the match , and with Ken Leek dropped for disciplinary reasons in rookie Hughie <unk> 's favour , City were effectively playing with ten men and offered little threat going forward . Bobby Smith and Terry Dyson gave " Spurs " a 2 – 0 win and the first " double " of the 20th century , with Banks unable to prevent either goal . 
 The 1961 – 62 season proved to be highly disappointing , as Leicester finished 14th in the league and exited the FA Cup at the hands of Stoke City . The only highlight was the club 's participation in the European Cup Winners ' Cup , which actually put Banks in the difficult position of choosing to play for his club against Spanish club Atlético Madrid or choosing to attend the England versus Portugal match as a non @-@ playing squad member . He elected to attend both games , leaving London at full @-@ time to reach Leicester 30 minutes before the kick @-@ off against Madrid . A last minute goal earned the Spaniards a 1 – 1 draw at Filbert Street . In the return leg , Banks saved an Enrique Collar penalty , but Madrid were awarded a second penalty which Collar converted , and Leicester lost the game 2 – 0 ( losing the tie 3 – 1 on aggregate ) . 
 Banks broke his nose at Craven Cottage , on the opening day of the 1962 – 63 season , in a 2 – 1 defeat to Fulham . Leicester went to chase a possible double , reaching the FA Cup semi @-@ finals whilst lying top of the table in April . City beat Liverpool 1 – 0 at Hillsborough to reach the final , with Banks keeping a clean sheet despite his goal being under a near @-@ constant siege from the Merseyside club . The News of the World reported that Liverpool had had 34 attempts on goal to Leicester 's one , and Banks later stated that it was his finest performance at club level . Yet Banks then broke a finger in a 2 – 1 defeat to West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns , and was out injured as Leicester lost their final three league games to end the season in a disappointing fourth place . In the 1963 FA Cup Final , Banks and the rest of the team underperformed , and lost the game 3 – 1 to Manchester United . 
 City ended the 1963 – 64 season in 11th place , having been inconsistent all season . Success instead came through the League Cup , as they beat West Ham United 6 – 3 over two legs in the semi @-@ finals to reach the final against Stoke City . The opening tie at the Victoria Ground finished 1 – 1 in extremely muddy conditions as Banks spilled a shot from Bill Asprey , with Keith <unk> pouncing on the rebound . Back at Filbert Street , goals from Mike Stringfellow , Dave Gibson and Howard Riley won the game for Leicester 3 – 2 and settled the tie at 4 – 3 . 
 Banks started the 1964 – 65 season on wages of £ 40 a week , and the club only agreed to pay £ 60 a week in December . These miserly wages made it difficult for the club to spend the £ 80 @,@ 000 it received for the sale of Frank McLintock – he had put in a transfer request over dissatisfaction with his pay and quality replacements were reluctant to join a club that paid full internationals like Banks and McLintock no more than the base rate that rival clubs paid to average players . Leicester finished 18th in the league and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Liverpool at Anfield in the Sixth Round . In the League Cup , City struggled to get past Peterborough United ( in a replay ) , Grimsby Town and Crystal Palace ( in a replay ) , before they recorded an 8 – 1 victory over Coventry City at Highfield Road . After easing past Plymouth Argyle in the semi @-@ finals , Banks found himself playing in another League Cup final . However Chelsea won the final after successfully defending their 3 – 2 win at Stamford Bridge with a goalless draw at Filbert Street . 
 He missed the first nine games of the 1965 – 66 season after breaking his wrist diving at the feet of Northampton Town 's Joe Kiernan in a pre @-@ season friendly . Leicester finished the season in seventh spot , and exited both cup competitions at the hands of Manchester City . 
 Despite being a World Cup winner in the previous summer , Banks was dropped towards the end of the 1966 – 67 season for highly promising teenage reserve Peter Shilton . Manager Matt Gillies was blunt , telling Banks " we [ Gillies and the club 's directors ] think your best days are behind you , and you should move on " . Teammate Richie Norman told Banks that Gillies was pressured into the decision after Shilton told the board he would leave the club unless he was given first team football . Banks was transfer listed at £ 50 @,@ 000 , the same price the club received for Derek Dougan in March 1967 . However many of the big clubs were unwilling to outlay such an expense on a goalkeeper . Liverpool manager Bill Shankly showed strong interest , but could not convince the club 's board of directors to agree to such a large fee for a goalkeeper . West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood was prepared to match the fee , but instead signed Kilmarnock 's Bobby Ferguson for £ 65 @,@ 000 as he had already agreed terms with Kilmarnock and did not want to go back on his word . Terms were instead agreed with Stoke City , a mid @-@ table First Division side . 
 = = = Stoke City = = = 
 On leaving Filbert Street , Banks requested a loyalty bonus from Leicester , and was told by Matt Gillies " We 've decided not to pay you a penny . There 's to be no compensation payment and that 's final . " Banks then refused the move until Stoke boss Tony Waddington seemingly negotiated a £ 2 @,@ 000 payment out of Leicester . It was only some years later that Banks was informed that Stoke had actually made the payment , not Leicester . Waddington valued good goalkeepers highly , and the two built up a close relationship . During this time , Banks moved to Madeley , Staffordshire . He replaced John Farmer 's as the club 's number one , and kept goal in the last four games of the 1966 – 67 season , making his home debut at the Victoria Ground in a 3 – 1 win over former club Leicester . 
 Banks fitted in well at Stoke , as Waddington built a team of veteran players who were judged by some to be past their best . The " Potters " struggled near the foot of the First Division table in the 1967 – 68 and 1968 – 69 campaigns , before rising to ninth place in the 1969 – 70 season . Banks remained a reliable stopper for the club , though on 1 March 1969 he was knocked unconscious at Roker Park by Sunderland 's Malcolm Moore , and his replacement David Herd conceded four goals in a 4 – 1 defeat . Banks also played a season for the Cleveland Stokers of the American United Soccer Association in the summer of 1968 ; he played seven of the short @-@ lived club 's 12 games in Cleveland , Ohio . 
 Banks made what he believed to be three of the best saves of his career in a Stoke shirt . In the first instance he saved and caught a powerful and well placed header from Manchester City 's Wyn Davies from just eight yards out , in the second case he saved a Francis Lee header at Maine Road , and he made his third great save for the club by catching a volley from Tottenham Hotspur 's Alan Gilzean that had been hit from just six yards out at White Hart Lane . 
 Stoke began to compete for honours in the 1970 – 71 season , though despite impressive victories against the top two clubs – Arsenal and Leeds United – City ended the season in mid @-@ table obscurity . The club 's great achievement was in reaching the semi @-@ finals of the FA Cup , beating Millwall , Huddersfield Town , Ipswich Town and Hull City en route . Facing Arsenal at Hillsborough in the semi @-@ finals , they lost a two @-@ goal lead to draw 2 – 2 , and were then beaten 2 – 0 in the replay at Villa Park . 
 Despite another mid @-@ table finish in 1971 – 72 , Stoke beat Chesterfield , Tranmere Rovers , Hull City and Manchester United to reach another FA Cup semi @-@ final . They again faced Arsenal , and once more a draw at Hillsborough meant a replay at Goodison Park . The " Gunners " goals in a 2 – 1 victory came from a disputed Frank McLintock penalty and a John Radford goal that television replays showed was clearly offside . In a May 2011 interview , he said that he still felt " cheated " out of a chance to play for the club in an FA Cup final . Stoke and Banks found solace in the League Cup , though it took them 11 matches to reach the final after overcoming Southport , then Oxford United in a replay , Manchester United in a second replay , Bristol Rovers , and then West Ham United in a second replay following an aggregate draw after two legs . In extra @-@ time of the second leg with West Ham , Banks fouled Harry Redknapp to give up a penalty , and then saved Geoff Hurst 's powerful spot @-@ kick to keep City in the competition . They then faced Chelsea in the final at Wembley . Peter Osgood beat Banks with a hooked shot just before half @-@ time , but goals from Terry Conroy and George Eastham won Stoke the game at 2 – 1 . At the end of the season Banks was named as the FWA Footballer of the Year , becoming the first goalkeeper to receive the honour since Bert Trautmann in 1956 . 
 On 22 October 1972 , while driving home from a session on his injured shoulder with the Stoke physiotherapist , Banks lost control of his new Ford Consul ( a re @-@ badged Ford Granada Mk 1 ) car which ended up in a ditch . He had attempted to overtake a car on a sharp turn and collided with an oncoming Austin A60 van . He was taken to the North Staffordshire Hospital and during an operation received 200 stitches in his face and over 100 micro @-@ stitches inside the socket of his right eye , and was told the chances of saving the sight in his eye were 50 – 50 . His sight never returned , and as the loss of binocular vision severely limited his abilities as a goalkeeper , he retired from professional football the following summer . 
 = = = Fort Lauderdale Strikers = = = 
 In April 1977 he went to play as a named superstar in the North American Soccer League ( NASL ) for Fort Lauderdale Strikers . The Strikers won their division in 1977 , and Banks was named NASL Goalkeeper of the Year after he conceded only 29 goals in 26 games – the best defensive record in the NASL . He also played one League of Ireland game for St Patrick 's Athletic ; keeping a clean sheet in a 1 – 0 win over Shamrock Rovers at Richmond Park on 2 October 1977 . He returned to Fort Lauderdale and played 11 games in the 1978 season . 
 = = International career = = 
 Banks was capped twice for the England under @-@ 23 side in matches against Wales and Scotland in 1961 . 
 Ron Springett was the goalkeeper for England as Banks rose to prominence , but after the 1962 World Cup in Chile , a new coach was appointed in former England right @-@ back Alf Ramsey . Ramsey demanded sole control of the team and began looking towards the next World Cup . Banks won his first cap on 6 April 1963 against Scotland at Wembley , after Springett was dropped following a poor performance . England lost 2 – 1 , though Banks was blameless as Scotland 's goals came firstly from an error by Jimmy Armfield and then secondly from the penalty spot . He was picked for the next match against Brazil , which ended in a credible 1 – 1 draw after Bryan Douglas cancelled out Pepe 's opener . Banks continued to play consistently to become established as England 's first @-@ choice goalkeeper . In 1963 , he was picked to play against the Rest of the World , in a celebration match to mark 100 years of The Football Association . 
 Banks also played in two of England 's three games at the " Little World Cup " in Brazil in the summer of 1964 , a 1 – 1 draw with Portugal and a 1 – 0 defeat to Argentina . Blackpool 's Tony Waiters won five caps in the England goal in 1964 , but found that his challenge to Banks ' first team place came to an end after he conceded five goals to Brazil . During England 's summer of 1965 tour he built up a solid understanding with his defenders – George Cohen , Jack Charlton , Bobby Moore , and Ray Wilson – as he only conceded two goals in four matches against Hungary , Yugoslavia , West Germany , and Sweden . They then played seven friendlies in 1966 in the build @-@ up to the World Cup , though the team passed their biggest test of character in the British Home Championship , beating Scotland 4 – 3 in front of a crowd of over 130 @,@ 000 at Hampden Park . Going into the competition , the only defeat in 21 matches since the " Little World Cup " came against Austria , in a game that Banks missed due to injury . 
 = = = 1966 World Cup = = = 
 Banks entered the 1966 FIFA World Cup as England 's first choice goalkeeper , and his understudies Ron Springett and Peter Bonetti never took to the field during the tournament . England opened the tournament with a goalless draw against Uruguay , with Banks a virtual spectator as the highly defensive Uruguayans rarely ventured out of their own half . They then defeated Mexico 2 – 0 , with Banks again rarely troubled throughout . A 2 – 0 win over France then took England through the group stage without Banks conceding a goal . 
 England beat Argentina 1 – 0 in the last eight , with Geoff Hurst scoring with a header ; the match was sullied by the first @-@ half sending off of Argentinian midfielder Antonio <unk> , who refused to leave the pitch after being dismissed for dissent . In contrast to the previous games , the semi @-@ final against Portugal proved to be a fair contest between two sides of talented players eager to attack from the start of the match . Yet there was panic in the buildup to the game as trainer Harold Shepherdson forgot to buy chewing gum , which Banks used to make his hands stickier and better able to handle the ball , and so Shepherdson had to run to a nearby newsagents to purchase gum as the teams were in the tunnel . Bobby Charlton scored two goals , but Portugal made a strong finish and won a penalty on 82 minutes after Jack Charlton handled the ball in the penalty area . Eusébio converted the penalty after sending Banks the wrong way , and the game finished 2 – 1 in England 's favour . This was the first goal Banks had conceded for England in 721 minutes of regular play , since giving up Scotland 's last goal after 81 minutes of the Home International clash in April . This remains a record for an England goalkeeper . 
 England 's opponents in the final were West Germany . It was England who dominated the final but it was Banks who was beaten first . A weak header from Ray Wilson handed a chance to Helmut Haller , who sent an accurate but relatively weak shot into the corner of the net ; Banks had been unsighted by Jack Charlton , and he failed to adjust his position in time to reach the ball . England equalised through a Geoff Hurst header within six minutes and went ahead late in the second half through Martin Peters . With seconds left in the game , Lothar Emmerich sent a free kick into the England penalty area , and the ball fell to Wolfgang Weber , who guided the ball over a lunging Ray Wilson and an outstretched Banks into the net to take the game into extra @-@ time . In extra @-@ time , the Germans sent shots in at the England goal which Banks managed to catch and control without any great danger . Hurst scored two goals to complete his hat @-@ trick , and though many claimed his second goal never crossed the line Banks always maintained his belief that the officials called the decision correctly . Between these goals Banks had to deal with a fiery shot from Sigfried Held , and was later exposed only for Uwe Seeler to come just centimetres away from connecting with the ball .

 Banks went into the 1970 World Cup as England 's number one with 59 caps to his name , and had Peter Bonetti ( one cap ) and Alex Stepney ( six caps ) as his understudies . However he soon found that the heat and altitude at Guadalajara , Mexico difficult to cope with . The team 's efforts at acclimatization were not helped when Bobby Moore was falsely accused of stealing the infamous " Bogotá Bracelet " . Despite this , a Geoff Hurst goal was enough to beat their first opponents , Romania . A far tougher test awaited on 7 June , when England faced Brazil . The day before the match Banks was informed that he had been awarded an OBE . 
 Playing at pace , Brazil were putting England under enormous pressure and an attack was begun by captain Carlos Alberto who sent a low ball down the right flank for the speedy Jairzinho to latch on to . The Brazilian winger sped past left @-@ back Terry Cooper and crossed the ball into the six @-@ yard box , where Pelé connected with a powerful header to send the ball low towards the right @-@ hand corner of the goal . In the knowledge that his header was placed to perfection , Pelé immediately shouted " Gol ! " ( Brazilian Portuguese for goal ) . 
 The split @-@ second incident only allowed Banks time for one conscious thought – that the shot was impossible to catch , and the only way to prevent Pelé from following up on the rebound would be to parry the ball over the bar . The ball bounced two yards in front of the goal @-@ line , and Banks managed to make contact with the ball with the fingers of his right hand , and rolled his hand slightly to angle to ball over the crossbar . He landed in the inner netting of the goal , and knew he had saved the ball after witnessing Pelé 's reaction . Banks then rose to his feet to defend the corner , and broke into laughter after the following exchange : 
 " I thought that was a goal . " ( Pelé ) 
 " You and me both . " ( Banks ) 
 " You 're getting old , Banksy , you used to hold on to them . " ( Bobby Moore ) 
 Pelé , and numerous journalists and pundits , would later describe the save as the greatest in the history of the game . Banks would later say " They won 't remember me for winning the World Cup , it 'll be for that save . That 's how big a thing it is . People just want to talk about that save . " In 2002 the UK public voted the save No. 41 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments . 
 Brazil still won the game 1 – 0 – Jairzinho guided a shot past Banks in the second half . England ultimately joined Brazil in the last eight after a win in the final group game against Czechoslovakia . The reward was a rematch of the 1966 final against West Germany . 
 The day before the game Banks and England 's hopes of making further inroads into the World Cup were dented when he started to complain of an upset stomach . He became affected by violent stomach cramps and aching limbs , and spent his time in the bathroom sweating , shivering and vomiting . He passed an extremely undemanding fitness test but suffered a relapse shortly before the game and Ramsey was forced to rest him in place of Peter Bonetti . Ramsey remarked that " of all the players to lose , we had to lose him . " Banks watched the game on television at the hotel as England lost a two @-@ goal lead to be eliminated 3 – 2 after extra time ; due to a time delay on the broadcast he switched the television off with England 2 – 0 in the lead as Bobby Moore returned to the hotel to break the news of the defeat . Conspiracies later surfaced that Banks had been poisoned to take him out of the game , but with no evidence to support them Banks never believed in these conspiracies .

 Only four teams competed in UEFA Euro 1972 : Belgium ( hosts ) , Hungary , the Soviet Union , and West Germany . England came close to qualifying , but lost 3 – 1 to West Germany in the final round of qualifying . 
 On 15 May 1971 , Banks was involved in a notorious incident with George Best who , while playing against England for Northern Ireland , flicked the ball out of Banks ' hands and headed it into the net . The move was audacious , but was disallowed by the referee , who judged it to be dangerous play . Banks played his 73rd and final game for England on 27 May 1972 , in a 1 – 0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park . During his 73 international games he kept 35 clean sheets and lost just nine games .

 In December 1977 he was appointed as a coach at Port Vale by manager Dennis Butler , being demoted to reserve coach in October 1978 by new boss Alan Bloor . Banks enjoyed coaching but soon resigned his position , feeling that players such as Bernie Wright refused to take his advice on board . He applied for the vacant management positions at Lincoln City and Rotherham United , but was rejected . He instead accepted the role as manager of Alliance Premier League part @-@ time club Telford United . He signed a goalkeeper , centre @-@ half and centre @-@ forward from Bangor City for £ 1 @,@ 500 , as well as former Stoke striker John Ruggiero . The " Bucks " finished in 13th place in 1979 – 80 . In November 1980 , he left Jackie Mudie in temporary charge of team affairs whilst he underwent surgery , who led the club to defeat in the FA Trophy at the hands of a lower league club . On his return to the club Banks was sacked . He was offered the position of raffle @-@ ticket seller , and accepted the post in the belief that it would entitle him to the money owed to him in the terms of his management contract ; he eventually had to settle for 50 % of his contract . He later stated that " It broke my heart ... I did not want to stay in the game . "

 Banks first met his wife Ursula during his National service in Germany in 1955 . They had three children : Robert ( born July 1958 ) , Wendy ( 1963 ) , and Julie ( 1969 ) . He separated from Ursula during his time in America , but the couple reunited when Banks returned to England . Banks ' nephew is Nick Banks , drummer of the band Pulp . 
 Shortly after his retirement , Banks was surprised by Eamonn Andrews for an episode of This Is Your Life . He later fronted a Leicester based hospitality company . He lost a significant sum of money when the business failed , but was helped out by Leicester City , who offered him a belated testimonial match . He was appointed as Stoke City 's president following the death of Stanley Matthews . Since the 1980s he has been a member of the three man pool 's panel . 
 In 2001 , he sold his World Cup winners medal at Christie 's for £ 124 @,@ 750 , and his international cap from the final was also sold at £ 27 @,@ 025 . 
 Banks was an Inaugural Inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 . In March 2004 , he was named by Pelé as one of the world 's 125 greatest living footballers . He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Keele University in February 2006 . In May 2006 , Banks was the first " legend " to be inducted into a new Walk of Fame , by having a plaque installed in the pavement in front of Sheffield Town Hall . In July 2008 , Pelé unveiled a statue of Banks making his famous 1970 World Cup save outside the Britannia Stadium . In March 2011 , he was also inducted into the City of Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent Hall of Fame , along with Roy Sproson . 
 In 1980 Banks published his first autobiography , Banks of England . He published a more comprehensive autobiography in 2002 : Banksy : My Autobiography . Irish investigative author , Don Mullan , published a boyhood memoir in 2006 called <unk> <unk> : A Hero Who Could Fly in which he wrote about the influence of the England goalkeeper on his life . 
 In December 2015 , it was announced he was receiving treatment for kidney cancer .

 = Final stellation of the icosahedron = 
 In geometry , the complete or final stellation of the icosahedron is the outermost stellation of the icosahedron , and is " complete " and " final " because it includes all of the cells in the icosahedron 's stellation diagram . 
 This polyhedron is the seventeenth stellation of the icosahedron , and given as Wenninger model index 42 . 
 As a geometrical figure , it has two interpretations , described below : 
 As an irregular star ( self @-@ intersecting ) polyhedron with 20 identical self @-@ intersecting <unk> faces , 90 edges , 60 vertices . 
 As a simple polyhedron with 180 triangular faces ( 60 isosceles , 120 scalene ) , 270 edges , and 92 vertices . This interpretation is useful for polyhedron model building . 
 Johannes Kepler researched stellations that create regular star polyhedra ( the Kepler @-@ Poinsot polyhedra ) in 1619 , but the complete icosahedron , with irregular faces , was first studied in 1900 by Max Brückner . 
 = = History = = 
 1619 : In Harmonices Mundi , Johannes Kepler first applied the stellation process , recognizing the small stellated dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron as regular polyhedra . 
 1809 : Louis Poinsot rediscovered Kepler 's polyhedra and two more , the great icosahedron and great dodecahedron as regular star polyhedra , now called the Kepler – Poinsot polyhedra . 
 1812 : Augustin @-@ Louis Cauchy made a further enumeration of star polyhedra , proving there are only 4 regular star polyhedra . 
 1900 : Max Brückner extended the stellation theory beyond regular forms , and identified ten stellations of the icosahedron , including the complete stellation . 
 1924 : A.H. Wheeler in 1924 published a list of 20 stellation forms ( 22 including reflective copies ) , also including the complete stellation . 
 1938 : In their 1938 book The Fifty Nine <unk> , H. S. M. Coxeter , P. Du Val , H. T. <unk> and J. F. Petrie stated a set of stellation rules for the regular icosahedron and gave a systematic enumeration of the fifty @-@ nine stellations which conform to those rules . The complete stellation is referenced as the eighth in the book . 
 1974 : In Wenninger 's 1974 book <unk> Models , the final stellation of the icosahedron is included as the 17th model of stellated icosahedra with index number <unk> . 
 1995 : Andrew Hume named it in his <unk> polyhedral database as the <unk> ( the echidna , or spiny anteater is a small mammal that is covered with coarse hair and spines and which curls up in a ball to protect itself ) . 
 = = Interpretations = = 
 = = = As a stellation = = = 
 The stellation of a polyhedron extends the faces of a polyhedron into infinite planes and generates a new polyhedron that is bounded by these planes as faces and the intersections of these planes as edges . The Fifty Nine <unk> enumerates the stellations of the regular icosahedron , according to a set of rules put forward by J. C. P. Miller , including the complete stellation . The Du Val symbol of the complete stellation is H , because it includes all cells in the stellation diagram up to and including the outermost " h " layer . 
 = = = As a simple polyhedron = = = 
 As a simple , visible surface polyhedron , the outward form of the final stellation is composed of 180 triangular faces , which are the outermost triangular regions in the stellation diagram . These join along 270 edges , which in turn meet at 92 vertices , with an Euler characteristic of 2 . 
 The 92 vertices lie on the surfaces of three concentric spheres . The innermost group of 20 vertices form the vertices of a regular dodecahedron ; the next layer of 12 form the vertices of a regular icosahedron ; and the outer layer of 60 form the vertices of a <unk> truncated icosahedron . The radii of these spheres are in the ratio 
 <formula> 
 When regarded as a three @-@ dimensional solid object with edge lengths a , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> √ 2 ( where φ is the golden ratio ) the complete icosahedron has surface area 
 <formula> 
 and volume 
 <formula> 
 = = = As a star polyhedron = = = 
 The complete stellation can also be seen as a self @-@ intersecting star polyhedron having 20 faces corresponding to the 20 faces of the underlying icosahedron . Each face is an irregular 9 / 4 star polygon , or <unk> . Since three faces meet at each vertex it has 20 × 9 / 3 
 = 60 vertices ( these are the outermost layer of visible vertices and form the tips of the " spines " ) and 20 × 9 / 2 = 
 90 edges ( each edge of the star polyhedron includes and connects two of the 180 visible edges ) . 
 When regarded as a star icosahedron , the complete stellation is a noble polyhedron , because it is both isohedral ( face @-@ transitive ) and isogonal ( vertex @-@ transitive ) . 
 = Harry Cobby = 
 Air Commodore Arthur Henry ( Harry ) Cobby , CBE , DSO , DFC & Two Bars , GM ( 26 August 1894 – 11 November 1955 ) was an Australian military aviator . He was the leading fighter ace of the Australian Flying Corps during World War I , with 29 victories , in spite of the fact that he saw active service for less than a year . 
 Born and educated in Melbourne , Cobby was a bank clerk when war broke out , and was prevented by his employer from enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force until 1916 . After completing flight training in England , he served on the Western Front with No. 4 Squadron AFC , operating Sopwith Camels . His achievements as a fighter pilot were recognised with the Distinguished Service Order , the Distinguished Flying Cross and two bars , and a mention in despatches . 
 Acclaimed a national hero , Cobby transferred to the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) in 1921 and rose to the rank of wing commander . He left the Permanent Air Force ( PAF ) in 1936 to join the Civil Aviation Board , but remained in the RAAF reserve . Re @-@ joining the PAF at the outbreak of World War II in 1939 , Cobby held senior posts including Director of Recruiting and Air Officer Commanding North @-@ Eastern Area . In 1943 , he was awarded the George Medal for rescuing fellow survivors of an aircraft crash . He was appointed Air Officer Commanding No. 10 Operational Group ( later Australian First Tactical Air Force ) the following year , but was relieved of his post in the wake of the " Morotai Mutiny " of April 1945 . Retiring from the Air Force in 1946 , Cobby served with the Department of Civil Aviation until his death on Armistice Day in 1955 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Arthur Henry Cobby was born in the Melbourne suburb of Prahran to Arthur Edward Stanley Cobby , a tram conductor , and his wife Alice . Known as Harry , the young Cobby completed his senior @-@ level education at University College , Armadale , before being commissioned into the 46th Infantry ( Brighton Rifles ) , a militia unit , in 1912 . He later transferred to the 47th Infantry . 
 When World War I broke out , Cobby attempted to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force but his employer , the Commonwealth Bank , refused to release him as his position of clerk was considered an essential occupation . He eventually managed to join the Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) on 23 December 1916 , despite a professed lack of interest in flying . He became a founding member of No. 4 Squadron AFC , and embarked for England aboard RMS <unk> on 17 January 1917 . 
 = = World War I combat service = = 
 No. 4 Squadron arrived in England in March 1917 to undergo training in preparation for service on the Western Front . Equipped with Sopwith Camels , the unit was sent to France in December . Cobby later admitted to being so nervous about the prospect of going into battle that " if anything could have been done by me to delay that hour , I would have left nothing undone to bring it about " . When he did see combat against the German Luftstreitkräfte for the first time , he had only twelve hours solo flying experience . 
 Cobby claimed an early victory , over a DFW reconnaissance plane , in February 1918 , but this was credited only as " driven down " and not confirmed . Based in the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais area , No. 4 Squadron supported Allied forces during the German Spring Offensive that commenced the following month . Cobby 's aerial opponents included members of Baron von Richthofen 's " Flying Circus " . On 21 March he shot down two of the formation 's Albatros <unk> , which were confirmed as his first official victories . 
 Having proved himself a talented and aggressive pilot , Cobby 's leadership abilities were recognised with his appointment as a flight commander on 14 May 1918 , and promotion to captain on 25 May . Described as " an imp of mischief " , he personalised his Sopwith Camel by fitting it with aluminium cutouts of comic actor Charlie Chaplin . Cobby again scored two kills in one day on 30 May near Estaires , when he destroyed an Albatros and an observation balloon , and repeated this feat the next day in the same area . He had been responsible for downing No. 4 Squadron 's first balloon at Merville earlier in May ; although vulnerable to attack with incendiary bullets , these large observation platforms , nicknamed <unk> ( Dragons ) , were generally well protected by enemy fighters and anti @-@ aircraft defences , and were thus considered a dangerous but valuable target . Cobby was recommended for the Military Cross on 3 June 1918 in recognition of his combat success and for being a " bold and skilful Patrol Leader , who is setting a fine example to his Squadron " . The award was changed to a Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) , appearing in the London Gazette on 2 July . 
 Cobby shot down three German aircraft on 28 June and was recommended for a bar to his DFC , highlighting his then @-@ current tally of 15 victories . On 15 July 1918 , he and another pilot dived on five Pfalz scouts near Armentières , Cobby accounting for two of the enemy aircraft and his companion for one . The Australians were then pursued by four Fokker Triplanes but managed to evade their attackers . This action earned Cobby a recommendation for a second bar to his DFC , the citation noting that he had scored 21 kills to date and had " succeeded in destroying so many machines by hard work and by using his brains , as well as by courage and brilliant flying " . The two bars to his DFC were gazetted on the same day , 21 September . On 16 August , Cobby led a bombing raid against the German airfield at Haubourdin , near Lille , the largest aerial assault by Allied forces up until then , resulting in 37 enemy aircraft being destroyed . The following day he led a similar attack on Lomme airfield and was recommended for the Distinguished Service Order as a result . Gazetted on 2 November , the citation for the award declared that " The success of these two raids was largely due to the determined and skilful leadership of this officer " . 
 By the end of his active service , Cobby was in charge of Allied formations numbering up to 80 aircraft . Fellow No. 4 Squadron ace , George Jones ( later Chief of the Air Staff ) , described him as the unit 's " natural leader in the air and in all off @-@ duty activities " ; his exploits made him a national hero . No. 4 Squadron was recognised as the most successful fighter squadron in France , accounting for as many as 220 victories . In September 1918 , Cobby was transferred to a training unit in England , where he found the strain of instructing pupils " much worse than flying in France " . He continued applying for a return to the front until the war ended in November , and was mentioned in despatches by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig the same month ( gazetted 27 December ) . Though Cobby 's final tally for the war is often given as 29 aircraft and 13 observation balloons destroyed , claim @-@ by @-@ claim analyses of his victories credit him with 24 aircraft and five balloons , for a grand total of 29 , making him the highest @-@ scoring member of the AFC , as well as the service 's only " balloon @-@ busting " ace . His proudest boast , however , was that as a flight commander he never lost a pilot over enemy territory . 
 = = Between the wars = = 
 Still instructing in England following the end of the war , Cobby was chosen to lead the AFC 's Anzac Day flypast over London before the Prince of Wales on 25 April 1919 , in concert with a parade by Australian soldiers . By 2 : 30 in the afternoon , he was taking his 50 @-@ strong aerial formation through a series of wild stunts over the alarmed Prince 's head , and later told the story that he flew so close to the marching soldiers that their bayonets almost pierced his undercarriage . Cobby later said that this was : " probably the most foolish thing I have ever done " . He returned to Australia in May 1919 , and married Hilda Maude Urban in Caulfield , Victoria , on 24 April 1920 ; the couple had a son and a daughter . Following the disbandment of the AFC , Cobby transferred to the short @-@ lived Australian Air Corps before joining the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force in 1921 . Ranked flying officer ( honorary flight lieutenant ) , he was one of the original 21 officers on the air force 's strength at its formation that March . His first posting , along with most of his colleagues , was to a mixed squadron equipped primarily with S.E.5s and DH.9s at No. 1 Flying Training School , based at RAAF Point Cook . Flight Lieutenant Cobby became Commanding Officer ( CO ) of No. 1 Squadron when it was reformed at Point Cook on 1 July 1925 , serving in the position until August 1926 . 
 By 1927 , Cobby had been promoted to squadron leader , and the following year went to England to attend RAF Staff College , Andover . Returning to Australia , he took over as CO of No. 3 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond , New South Wales , from Squadron Leader Frank Lukis on 13 January 1930 . At this time , the position of No. 3 Squadron commander doubled as CO of the base . Though popular with his staff , Cobby was not known for his attention to detail . In December 1930 , the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Commodore Richard Williams , arrived for an inspection and found the base to be in such a state of untidiness that he ordered every man on parade and gave them what was described as " an almighty dressing down " , threatening that Christmas leave would be cancelled unless the place was cleaned up . Having handed over to Squadron Leader Bill Bostock on 22 November 1931 , Cobby was promoted to wing commander on 1 May 1933 and subsequently served as RAAF Director of Intelligence . In this position he headed an interdepartmental committee that was formed in August 1933 to examine the possibilities of air survey and aerial photography to further national development . The committee 's findings , presented in April 1934 , favoured employing government agencies for such work and ultimately led to the formation of the North Australian Survey Flight from staff and aircraft of No. 1 Squadron in April 1935 . The resulting surveys of Queensland and the Northern Territory provided valuable input for the establishment of military airfields and other installations following the outbreak of World War II . Restless in the inter @-@ war years , Cobby retired from the Air Force to join the Civil Aviation Board as Controller of Operations in 1936 ; he also contributed to aviation magazines such as Australian Airmen and Popular Flying . His civil aviation duties included aircraft inspection , the issuing of licences and airworthiness certificates , maintenance of radio and meteorological services , and RAAF liaison . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Cobby was a member of the Citizen Air Force ( RAAF reserve ) during his time with the Civil Aviation Board , and rejoined the Permanent Air Force following the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 . Promoted to group captain , he officially returned to active service on 25 July 1940 as Director of Recruiting , a role that traded on his public image . On 25 August 1942 , he took over from Air Commodore Frank Lukis as Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) North @-@ Eastern Area in Townsville , Queensland . 1942 also saw the publication of High Adventure , Cobby 's account of his experiences in World War I ; the foreword was written by Air Vice Marshal George Jones , newly appointed Chief of the Air Staff and fellow No. 4 Squadron veteran . Cobby was promoted to temporary air commodore in July 1943 . On 7 September , he was travelling as a passenger on a Catalina flying boat when it crashed at Townsville . Although himself injured , Cobby helped rescue two other survivors , and was recommended for the George Medal for his " outstanding bravery " . The award was gazetted on 10 March 1944 . Cobby handed over command of North @-@ Eastern Area in November 1943 , and the following month was posted to Mount Martha , Victoria , as the Commandant of the RAAF Staff School ( later RAAF Staff College ) , remaining in the post until he was fully recovered from his injuries . On 16 June 1944 , he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) for his conduct of air operations over New Guinea as AOC North @-@ Eastern Area , the citation noting his " good leadership , personal example , keen understanding and continued encouragement " . 
 In August 1944 , Cobby became AOC of No. 10 Operational Group ( No. 10 OG ) , soon to be renamed the Australian First Tactical Air Force ( 1st TAF ) . In this role he commanded 20 @,@ 000 personnel in the RAAF 's major mobile strike force in the South West Pacific , consisting of fighter , close support , and airfield construction units . Cobby expressed misgivings concerning the command arrangements that saw RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne responsible for No. 10 OG 's administration , while its operational tasking was to be passed down through RAAF Command , the United States Thirteenth Air Force and Headquarters South West Pacific Area . He believed this required him to " try and serve two masters " , a situation he found " unworkable " . In the period 22 – 25 December 1944 , 1st TAF flew 513 Kittyhawk and Beaufighter sorties against targets in Halmahera . The following month , it undertook a further 661 sorties against targets in Halmahera , Celebes , Morotai and the Vogelkop . By early 1945 , Japanese air power in the South West Pacific had been virtually destroyed , and 1st TAF was increasingly assigned to garrison duties and harassing enemy bases on islands bypassed by US forces in their advance on the Philippines . During March and April , 1st TAF prepared for the invasion of Tarakan , an operation based around a mistaken judgement made by officers at Cobby 's headquarters that the island 's airstrip could be rapidly repaired and used to support the Borneo Campaign . 
 The relegation of fighter units to what appeared to be strategically unimportant ground attack missions led to a crisis in morale that precipitated the so @-@ called " Morotai Mutiny " in April 1945 , when eight of Cobby 's senior pilots , including Australia 's leading ace in the war , Group Captain Clive Caldwell , tendered their resignations in protest . Although one of the " mutineers " , Group Captain Wilf Arthur , had earlier voiced his concerns to Cobby and his headquarters staff regarding the efficacy of 1st TAF 's tasking , the AOC was taken aback by the resignations . He spoke to the officers individually and as a group , asking them , " Is this something against me , or having a go against me in this , because if so , if you feel that I have fallen down in my job , I will straight away ask to be recalled , " to which they replied , " It has nothing to do with you . " Cobby reported the incident to his immediate superior , Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock , who informed the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Vice Marshal Jones , and the Allied Air Forces Commander , Lieutenant General George Kenney . All made their way to Morotai and interviewed the pilots involved , and all concluded that Cobby should be relieved of his command . 
 Bostock held Cobby responsible for the " dangerously low level " of morale in 1st TAF , but also noted " it is clear that he has been badly served by his senior staff " . In the event , Jones transferred not only Cobby but also his staff officers , Group Captains Gibson and Simms , and Air Commodore Frederick Scherger took over command on 10 May . Cobby 's departure was greeted with relief by Australian Army commanders , who were frustrated by the poor working relationship between 1st TAF and the Army units at Tarakan . Cobby defended his leadership of 1st TAF at the subsequent inquiry before Judge John Vincent Barry . During his testimony he declared that while his officers " wished to do more in the war than they were doing ... it was not within the power of 1st <unk> to give them that more important or more interesting work " . He believed that his forces had played a significant part in making safe General MacArthur 's flank during the Philippines Campaign . Barry nevertheless found that Cobby had " failed to maintain proper control over his command " , and that his removal as 1st TAF commander was justified . Air Force historian Alan Stephens later described it as " a personal and institutional tragedy that a genuinely great figure in RAAF history had to end his career in such circumstances " . Similarly , The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History contends that Cobby 's " gallant service flying career ... became another victim of the weaknesses and feuding within the RAAF 's senior leadership during the Pacific War " . Stephens summed up Cobby 's military career by saying " No Australian airman 's experience better illustrates the tensions between ' command ' , ' leadership ' and ' heroism ' " , concluding that " the qualities that make a hero do not easily translate into those needed by a commander , although they are likely to engender leadership " .

 Cobby was officially discharged from the Air Force on 19 August 1946 . He was awarded the American Medal of Freedom on 15 April 1948 , in recognition of his war service . The citation noted that from September 1944 to January 1945 , he displayed " exceptionally sound judgement and far sighted planning ... and materially assisted in support of the operations in the Philippine Liberation Campaign " . Cobby had rejoined the Civil Aviation Board ( by then the Department of Civil Aviation ) after leaving the RAAF and served as Regional Director , New South Wales , from 1947 to 1954 . He was appointed Director of Flying Operations early the following year . 
 On Armistice Day , 11 November 1955 , Cobby collapsed in his Melbourne office and died later that day of hypertensive cerebrovascular disease at Heidelberg Repatriation General Hospital . His wife and children survived him . On 15 November , he was given a military funeral at St Mary 's Church of England , Caulfield , and cremated at Springvale Crematorium . 
 Harry Cobby 's tally of victories in World War I was the highest by a member of the Australian Flying Corps ( the top @-@ scoring Australian aces of the war , Robert A. Little and Roderic ( Stan ) Dallas , flew with the British Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force ) . His record as an ace wearing the Australian uniform has remained unbeaten . Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams , Director General of Civil Aviation from 1946 to 1955 and widely regarded as the " Father of the RAAF " , described Cobby as " a man whose personal story is threaded through the entire history of Australian service and civil aviation " . One of the aluminium cutouts of Charlie Chaplin that Cobby attached to his Sopwith Camel in World War I later went on show at RAAF Museum , Point Cook , and the tail skid of one of his victims was displayed at the Australian War Memorial , Canberra . Cobby Street , in the Canberra suburb of Campbell , is named in his honour .

 This was the most expensive Glee episode yet , at a reported $ 6 million . The budget exceeded the previous record @-@ holder , " The Sue Sylvester Shuffle " , which was the episode that followed the 2011 Super Bowl . It was also the show 's first major out @-@ of @-@ state location shoot . The cast and crew filmed for five weekdays in New York City , from April 25 through April 29 , 2011 . Forty members of the crew were flown to New York along with the cast , and were joined there by sixty local crew members . All three of the show 's creators — who also serve as executive or co @-@ executive producers — were present : Ryan Murphy , Ian Brennan and episode writer and director Brad Falchuk , along with executive producer Dante Di Loreto and first assistant director Leo Bauer . 
 Ten locations were used during the New York filming , including Times Square , Lincoln Center , the Gershwin Theatre , Central Park , and Sardi 's . LuPone made a guest appearance as herself in the Sardi 's scene , which was shot in the morning on Thursday to accommodate her schedule — she had an 11 : 00 am rehearsal for another show . Washington Square Park , which was used on the final day of filming , had not been approved as a location by the city until after the production team arrived in New York . Di Loreto noted that the biggest challenge of shooting in the city was " the amount of people who can say no . " 
 While some of the costumes for the New York shoot were prepared ahead of time , much of the costuming was done in New York , and the costumes for the episode received an Emmy Award nomination . Costume designer Lou Eyrich revealed that the plan was to have the costuming be a " little nod " to the " iconic New York places we were going to shoot " , and with a " little bit of ' 50s , ' 60s flair " , but not too " vintage " . She said , " We landed in New York on a Saturday night , shopped all day Sunday , threw them in the clothes " for the filming that began on Monday . According to an article in The Hollywood Reporter , twenty @-@ six outfits were found in a single day . 
 Filming continued back in Los Angeles , where episodes are typically shot , including a location shoot at the Million Dollar Theater to film Morrison 's scene where he sings " Still Got Tonight " on a Broadway stage . The shooting for the episode — and the season — wrapped up in the early hours of May 12 , 2011 . 
 Recurring guest star Groff appeared in this episode as Jesse , as did Jackson as Vocal Adrenaline coach Dustin Goolsby and Charice as his star vocalist Sunshine . Other recurring characters included glee club members Mike Chang , Sam Evans and Lauren Zizes ( Ashley Fink ) , and Kurt 's boyfriend Blaine Anderson . 
 The episode featured five original songs and five musical cover versions .
