 Inspired by the Grandmaster Flash song " The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel " , he often attended a club called Eve After Dark to watch many DJs and rappers performing live . He subsequently became a DJ in the club , initially under the name " Dr. J " , based on the nickname of Julius Erving , his favorite basketball player . At the club , he met aspiring rapper Antoine <unk> , later to become member DJ Yella of N.W.A. Soon afterwards he adopted the moniker Dr. Dre , a mix of previous alias Dr. J and his first name , referring to himself as the " Master of <unk> " . Eve After Dark had a back room with a small four @-@ track studio . In this studio , Dre and Yella recorded several demos . In their first recording session , they recorded a song entitled " Surgery " , with the lyrics " calling Dr. Dre to surgery " serving as the chorus to the song . He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin ' Cru under the independent Kru @-@ Cut Records in 1984 . The group would become stars of the electro @-@ hop scene that dominated early 1980s West Coast hip hop . " Surgery " , which was officially released after being recorded prior to the group 's official formation , would prominently feature Dr. Dre on the turntable . The record would become the group 's first hit , selling 50 @,@ 000 copies within the Compton area . 
 Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station <unk> , boosting ratings for its afternoon rush @-@ hour show The Traffic Jam . Dr. Dre 's earliest recordings were released in 1994 on a compilation titled Concrete Roots . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website Allmusic described the compiled music , released " several years before Dre developed a distinctive style " , as " surprisingly generic and unengaging " and " for dedicated fans only " . 
 His frequent absences from school jeopardized his position as a diver on his school 's swim team . After high school , he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother 's demands for him to get a job or continue his education . After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school , he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother 's house . He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve 's After Dark nightclub . 
 = = = 1986 – 91 : N.W.A and Ruthless Records = = = 
 In 1986 , Dr. Dre met rapper O 'Shea Jackson — nicknamed Ice Cube — who collaborated with Dr. Dre to record songs for Ruthless Records , a rap record label run by local rapper Eazy @-@ E. N.W.A and fellow West Coast rapper Ice @-@ T are widely credited as seminal artists of the gangsta rap genre , a profanity @-@ heavy subgenre of hip hop , replete with gritty depictions of urban crime and gang lifestyle . Not feeling constricted to racially charged political issues pioneered by rap artists such as Public Enemy or Boogie Down Productions , N.W.A favored themes and uncompromising lyrics , offering stark descriptions of violent , inner @-@ city streets . Propelled by the hit " Fuck tha Police " , the group 's first full album Straight Outta Compton became a major success , despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours . The Federal Bureau of Investigation sent Ruthless Records a warning letter in response to the song 's content . 
 After Ice Cube left N.W.A in 1989 over financial disputes , Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group 's second album <unk> . He also produced tracks for a number of other acts on Ruthless Records , including Eazy @-@ E 's 1988 solo debut Eazy @-@ Duz @-@ It , Above the Law 's 1990 debut Livin ' Like Hustlers , Michel 'le 's 1989 self title 'd debut , The D.O.C. ' s 1989 debut No One Can Do It Better , J.J. Fad 's 1988 debut Supersonic and funk rock musician Jimmy Z 's 1991 album <unk> Madness 
 = = = 1992 – 96 : The Chronic and Death Row Records = = = 
 After a dispute with Eazy @-@ E , Dre left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of friend , and N.W.A lyricist , The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time , Suge Knight . Knight , a notorious strongman and <unk> , was able to have Eazy @-@ E release Young from his contract and , using Dr. Dre as his flagship artist , founded Death Row Records . In 1992 Young released his first single , the title track to the film Deep Cover , a collaboration with rapper Snoop Dogg , whom he met through Warren G. Dr. Dre 's debut solo album was The Chronic , released under Death Row Records with Suge Knight as executive producer . Young ushered in a new style of rap , both in terms of musical style and lyrical content , including introducing a number of artists to the industry including Snoop Dogg , Kurupt , Daz Dillinger , RBX , The Lady of Rage , Nate Dogg and Jewell . 
 On the strength of singles such as " Nuthin ' but a ' G ' Thang " , " Let Me Ride " , and " Fuck wit Dre Day ( and Everybody 's Celebratin ' ) " ( known as " Dre Day " for radio and television play ) , all of which featured Snoop Dogg as guest vocalist , The Chronic became a cultural phenomenon , its G @-@ funk sound dominating much of hip hop music for the early 1990s . In 1993 the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) certified the album triple platinum , and Dr. Dre also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for his performance on " Let Me Ride " . For that year , Billboard magazine also ranked Dr. Dre as the eighth best @-@ selling musical artist , The Chronic as the sixth best @-@ selling album , and " Nuthin ' but a ' G ' Thang " as the 11th best @-@ selling single . 
 Besides working on his own material , Dr. Dre produced Snoop Dogg 's debut album Doggystyle , which became the first debut album for an artist to enter the Billboard 200 album charts at number one . In 1994 Dr. Dre produced some songs on the soundtracks to the films Above the Rim and Murder Was the Case . He collaborated with fellow N.W.A member Ice Cube for the song " Natural Born Killaz " in 1995 . For the film Friday , Dre recorded " Keep Their Heads <unk> ' " , which reached number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on the Hot Rap Singles ( now Hot Rap Tracks ) charts . 
 In 1995 , Death Row Records signed rapper 2Pac , and began to position him as their major star : he collaborated with Dr. Dre on the commercially successful single " California Love " , which became both artists ' first song to top the Billboard Hot 100 . However , in March 1996 Young left the label amidst a contract dispute and growing concerns that label boss Suge Knight was corrupt , financially dishonest and out of control . Later that year , he formed his own label , Aftermath Entertainment , under the distribution label for Death Row Records , Interscope Records . Subsequently , Death Row Records suffered poor sales by 1997 , especially following the death of 2Pac and the racketeering charges brought against Knight . 
 Dr. Dre also appeared on the single " No Diggity " by R & B group Blackstreet in 1996 : it too was a sales success , topping the Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks , and later won the award for Best R & B Vocal by a Duo or Group at the 1997 Grammy Awards . After hearing it for the first time , several of Dr. Dre 's former Death Row colleagues , including 2Pac , recorded and attempted to release a song titled " Toss It Up " , containing numerous insults aimed at Dr. Dre and using a deliberately similar instrumental to " No Diggity " , but were forced to replace the production after Blackstreet issued the label with a cease and desist order stopping them from distributing the song . 
 = = = 1996 – 98 : Move to Aftermath Entertainment = = = 
 The Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath album , released on November 26 , 1996 , featured songs by Dr. Dre himself , as well as by newly signed Aftermath Entertainment artists , and a solo track " Been There , Done That " , intended as a symbolic farewell to gangsta rap . Despite being classified platinum by the RIAA , the album was not very popular among music fans . In October 1996 , Dre performed " Been There , Done That " on Saturday Night Live . In 1997 , Dr. Dre produced several tracks on The Firm 's The Album ; it was met with largely negative reviews from critics . Rumors began to abound that Aftermath was facing financial difficulties . Aftermath Entertainment also faced a trademark infringement lawsuit by the underground thrash metal band Aftermath . First Round Knock Out , a compilation of various tracks produced and performed by Dr. Dre was also released in 1996 , with material ranging from World Class Wreckin ' Cru to N.W.A to Death Row recordings . Dr. Dre chose to take no part in the ongoing East Coast – West Coast hip hop rivalry of the time , instead producing for , and appearing on , several New York artists ' releases , such as Nas ' " Nas Is Coming " , LL Cool J 's " Zoom " and Jay @-@ Z 's " Watch Me " . 
 The turning point for Aftermath came in 1998 , when Jimmy Iovine , the head of Aftermath 's parent label Interscope , suggested that Dr. Dre sign Eminem , a white rapper from Detroit . Dre produced three songs and provided vocals for two on Eminem 's successful and controversial debut album The Slim Shady LP , released in 1999 . The Dr. Dre @-@ produced lead single from that album , " My Name Is " , brought Eminem to public attention for the first time , and the success of The Slim Shady LP – it reached number two on the Billboard 200 and received general acclaim from critics – revived the label 's commercial ambitions and viability . 
 = = = 1999 – 2000 : 2001 = = = 
 Dr. Dre 's second solo album , 2001 , released on November 16 , 1999 , was considered an ostentatious return to his gangsta rap roots . It was initially titled The Chronic 2000 to imply being a sequel to his debut solo effort The Chronic but was re @-@ titled 2001 after Death Row Records released an unrelated compilation album with the title Chronic 2000 : Still Smokin in May 1999 . Other tentative titles included The Chronic 2001 and Dr. Dre . The album featured numerous collaborators , including Devin the Dude , Snoop Dogg , Kurupt , Xzibit , Nate Dogg , Eminem , Knoc @-@ turn 'al , King T , <unk> , Kokane , Mary J. Blige and new protégé Hittman , as well as co @-@ production between Dre and new Aftermath producer Mel @-@ Man . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website AllMusic described the sound of the album as " adding ominous strings , soulful vocals , and reggae " to Dr. Dre 's style . The album was highly successful , charting at number two on the Billboard 200 charts and has since been certified six times platinum , validating a recurring theme on the album : Dr. Dre was still a force to be reckoned with , despite the lack of major releases in the previous few years . The album included popular hit singles " Still D.R.E. " and " Forgot About Dre " , both of which Dr. Dre performed on NBC 's Saturday Night Live on October 23 , 1999 . Dr. Dre won the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year , Non @-@ Classical in 2000 , and joined the Up in Smoke Tour with fellow rappers Eminem , Snoop Dogg , and Ice Cube that year as well . 
 During the course of 2001 's popularity , Dr. Dre was involved in several lawsuits . Lucasfilm Ltd . , the film company behind the Star Wars film franchise , sued him over the use of the THX @-@ trademarked " Deep Note " . The <unk> Band also sued Dr. Dre over alleged infringement regarding its song " <unk> ' " in his song " Let 's Get High " from the 2001 album ; Dr. Dre was ordered to pay $ 1 @.@ 5 million to the band in 2003 . The online music file @-@ sharing company Napster also settled a lawsuit with him and heavy metal rock band Metallica in the summer of 2001 , agreeing to block access to certain files that artists do not want to have shared on the network . 
 = = = 2001 – 07 : Focus on production and Detox = = = 
 Following the success of 2001 , Dr. Dre focused on producing songs and albums for other artists . He co @-@ produced six tracks on Eminem ’ s landmark Marshall Mathers LP , including the Grammy @-@ winning lead single , “ The Real Slim Shady ” . The album itself earned a Grammy and proved to be the fastest @-@ selling rap album of all time , moving 1 @.@ 76 million units in its first week alone . He produced the single " Family Affair " by R & B singer Mary J. Blige for her album No More Drama in 2001 . He also produced " Let Me Blow Ya Mind " , a duet by rapper Eve and No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stefani and signed R & B singer Truth Hurts to Aftermath in 2001 . Dr. Dre was the executive producer of Eminem ’ s 2002 release , The Eminem Show . He produced three songs on the album , one of which was released as a single , and he appeared in the award @-@ winning video for “ Without Me ” . He also produced The D.O.C. ' s 2003 album Deuce , where he made a guest appearance on the tracks " Psychic <unk> Hotline " , " Gorilla <unk> ' " and " Judgment Day " . 
 Another copyright @-@ related lawsuit hit Dr. Dre in the fall of 2002 , when Sa Re Ga Ma , a film and music company based in Calcutta , India , sued Aftermath Entertainment over an uncredited sample of the Lata Mangeshkar song " Thoda <unk> <unk> Hai " on the Aftermath @-@ produced song " Addictive " by singer Truth Hurts . In February 2003 , a judge ruled that Aftermath would have to halt sales of Truth Hurts ' album Truthfully Speaking if the company would not credit Mangeshkar . 
 Another successful album on the Aftermath label was Get Rich or Die Tryin ' , the 2003 major @-@ label debut album by Queens , New York @-@ based rapper 50 Cent . Dr. Dre produced or co @-@ produced four tracks on the album , including the hit single " In da Club " , a joint production between Aftermath , Eminem 's boutique label Shady Records and Interscope . Eminem 's fourth album since joining Aftermath , Encore , again saw Dre taking on the role of executive producer , and this time he was more actively involved in the music , producing or co @-@ producing a total of eight tracks , including three singles . In November 2004 , at the Vibe magazine awards show in Los Angeles , Dr. Dre was attacked by a fan named Jimmy James Johnson , who was supposedly asking for an autograph . In the resulting scuffle , then @-@ G @-@ Unit rapper Young Buck stabbed the man . Johnson claimed that Suge Knight , president of Death Row Records , paid him $ 5 @,@ 000 to assault Dre in order to humiliate him before he received his Lifetime Achievement Award . Knight immediately went on CBS 's The Late Late Show to deny involvement and insisted that he supported Dr. Dre and wanted Johnson charged . In September 2005 , Johnson was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to stay away from Dr. Dre until 2008 . 
 Dr. Dre also produced " How We Do " , a 2005 hit single from rapper The Game from his album The Documentary , as well as 50 Cent 's successful sophomore album The Massacre . For an issue of Rolling Stone magazine in April 2005 , Dr. Dre was ranked 54th out of 100 artists for Rolling Stone magazine 's list " The Immortals : The Greatest Artists of All Time " . Kanye West wrote the summary for Dr. Dre , where he stated Dr. Dre 's song " <unk> " as where he " got ( his ) whole sound from " . 
 In November 2006 , Dr. Dre began working with Raekwon on his album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II . He also produced tracks for the rap albums Buck the World by Young Buck , Curtis by 50 Cent , Tha Blue Carpet Treatment by Snoop Dogg , and Kingdom Come by Jay @-@ Z. Dre also appeared on Timbaland 's track " Bounce " , from his 2007 solo album , Timbaland Presents Shock Value alongside , Missy Elliott , and Justin Timberlake . During this period , The D.O.C. stated that Dre had been working with him on his fourth album Voices through Hot Vessels , which he planned to release after Detox arrives . 
 Planned but unreleased albums during Dr. Dre 's tenure at Aftermath have included a full @-@ length reunion with Snoop Dogg titled Breakup to Makeup , an album with fellow former N.W.A member Ice Cube which was to be titled Heltah Skeltah , an N.W.A reunion album , and a joint album with fellow producer Timbaland titled Chairmen of the Board . 
 In 2007 , Dr. Dre 's third studio album , formerly known as Detox , was slated to be his final studio album . Work for the upcoming album dates back to 2001 , where its first version was called " the most advanced rap album ever " , by producer Scott Storch . Later that same year , he decided to stop working on the album to focus on producing for other artists , but then changed his mind ; the album had initially been set for a fall 2005 release . Producers confirmed to work on the album include DJ Khalil , Nottz , Bernard " Focus " Edwards Jr . , Hi @-@ Tek , J.R. Rotem , RZA , Jay @-@ Z , Warren G , and Boi @-@ 1da . Snoop Dogg claimed that Detox was finished , according to a June 2008 report by Rolling Stone magazine . After another delay based on producing other artists ' work , Detox was then scheduled for a 2010 release , coming after 50 Cent 's Before I Self Destruct and Eminem 's Relapse , an album for which Dr. Dre handled the bulk of production duties . In a Dr Pepper commercial that debuted on May 28 , 2009 , he premiered the first official snippet of Detox . 50 Cent and Eminem asserted in an interview on BET 's 106 & Park that Dr. Dre had around a dozen songs finished for Detox .

 On December 15 , 2008 , Dre appeared in the remix of the song " Set It Off " by Canadian rapper Kardinal Offishall ( also with Pusha T ) ; the remix debuted on DJ Skee 's radio show . At the beginning of 2009 , Dre produced , and made a guest vocal performance on , the single " Crack a Bottle " by Eminem and the single sold a record 418 @,@ 000 downloads in its first <unk> and reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart on the week of February 12 , 2009 . Along with this single , in 2009 Dr. Dre produced or co @-@ produced 19 of 20 tracks on Eminem 's album Relapse . These included other hit singles " We Made You " , " Old Time 's Sake " , and " 3 a.m. " ( the only track Dre did not produce was the Eminem @-@ produced single " Beautiful " ) . 
 On April 20 , 2010 , " Under Pressure " , featuring Jay @-@ Z and co @-@ produced with Scott Storch , was confirmed by Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre during an interview at Fenway Park as the album 's first single . The song leaked prior to its intended release in an unmixed , unmastered form without a chorus on June 16 , 2010 : however , critical reaction to the song was lukewarm , and Dr. Dre later announced in an interview that the song , along with any other previously leaked tracks from Detox 's recording process , would not appear on the final version of the album . Two genuine singles – " Kush " , a collaboration with Snoop Dogg and fellow rapper Akon , and " I Need a Doctor " with Eminem and singer Skylar Grey – were released in the United States during November 2010 and February 2011 respectively : the latter achieved international chart success , reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and later being certified double platinum by the RIAA and the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) . 
 On June 25 , 2010 , the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers honored Dr. Dre with its Founders Award for inspiring other musicians . 
 In an August 2010 interview , Dr. Dre stated that an instrumental album titled The Planets is in its first stages of production ; each song being named after a planet in the Solar System . On September 3 , Dr. Dre showed support to longtime protégé Eminem , and appeared on his and Jay @-@ Z 's Home & Home Tour , performing hit songs such as " Still D.R.E. " , " Nuthin ' but a ' G ' Thang " , and " Crack a Bottle " , alongside Eminem and another protégé , 50 Cent . Sporting an " R.I.P. Proof " shirt , Dre was honored by Eminem telling Detroit 's Comerica Park to do the same . They did so , by chanting " <unk> @-@ <unk> " , to which he replied , " I 'm coming ! " 
 On November 14 , 2011 , Dre announced that he would be taking a break from music after he finished producing for artists Slim the Mobster and Kendrick Lamar . In this break , he stated that he would " work on bringing his Beats By Dre to a standard as high as Apple " and would also spend time with his family . 
 On January 9 , 2012 , Dre headlined the final nights of the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival , on the weekends of April 13 – 15 and April 20 – 22 , 2012 . 
 In a June 2014 interview with <unk> , Marsha Ambrosius talked about working on Dr. Dre ’ s third album . She stated that she had gone to Hawaii before the end of 2013 for a few weeks to work with him on “ so many things ” including his upcoming album and a project of her own among other unspecified projects . Ambrosius also told <unk> that Dr. Dre ’ s third album is no longer called Detox , but didn ’ t reveal the new title . In a September interview with Shots Fired that same year , Aftermath Entertainment in @-@ house producer Dawaun Parker confirmed the title change . Parker also refrained from revealing the new title because of the fact that the title hadn ’ t been leaked online . He also told Shots Fired that there are as many as 300 beats that have been created for the album over the years , but few of them have had vocals recorded over them . 
 The length of time that Detox had been record for , as well as the limited amount of material that had been officially released or leaked from the recording sessions , had given it considerable notoriety within the music industry . Numerous release dates ( including the ones mentioned above ) had been given for the album over the years since it was first announced , although none of them transpired to be genuine . Several musicians closely affiliated with Dr. Dre , including Snoop Dogg , fellow rappers 50 Cent and Game and producer DJ Quik , had speculated in interviews that the album will never be released , due to Dr. Dre 's business and entrepreneurial ventures having interfered with recording work , as well as causing him to lose motivation to record new material .

 In 2011 , a tumblr blog titled Dr. Dre Started Burning Man began proliferating the notion that the producer , rapper and entrepreneur had discovered Burning Man in 1995 during a music video shoot and offered to cover the cost of the event 's permit from the Nevada Bureau of Land Management under an agreement with the festival 's organizers that he could institute an entrance fee system , which had not existed before his participation . This claim was supported by an alleged letter from Dre to Nicole Threatt Young that indicated that Dre had shared his experience witnessing the Burning Man festival with her . 
 Business Insider mentions the portion of the letter where Dr. Dre purportedly states " someone should get behind this ... and make some money off these fools " and compares Dr. Dre 's potential entrepreneurial engagement with Burning Man as a parallel to Steve Jobs ' efforts to centralize and profit from the otherwise unorganized online music industry . According to Salon , Dr. Dre 's ethos seems to be aligned with seven of the ten principles of the Burning Man community : " radical self @-@ reliance , radical self @-@ expression , communal effort , civic responsibility , leaving no trace , participation and immediacy .

 Dr. Dre is renowned for constantly evolving his production style through the years , while always keeping in touch with his roots and re @-@ shaping elements from previous work . In the start of his career as a producer for the World Class Wreckin Cru in the mid @-@ 1980s , his beats were in the electro @-@ hop style pioneered by The Unknown DJ , and that of early hip @-@ hop groups like the Beastie Boys and Whodini . These influences are evident in Eazy E 's 1986 song Boyz @-@ n @-@ the @-@ Hood , which Dre produced . Sampling was at the time a key element of Dre 's production , the E @-@ mu SP @-@ 1200 being his primary instrument in the N.W.A days . 
 In 1987 , Dr. Dre sampled the Ohio Players ' ARP synth riffs from their 1973 funk hit " Funky Worm " in the N.W.A song " <unk> " . Being the first hip @-@ hop producer to sample the song , Dre both paved the way for the future popularization of the G @-@ funk style within hip @-@ hop , and established heavy synthesizer solos as an integral part of his production style . Dr. Dre was also one of the very first producers to interpolate the then little @-@ known drum break from The Winstons ' " Amen , Brother " in the N.W.A song " Straight Outta Compton " . This break has since <unk> a staple in not only hip @-@ hop , but all popular music , having been used in over 1700 songs . 
 From Straight Outta Compton on , Dre uses live musicians to replay old melodies rather than sampling them . In Ruthless Records , collaborators included guitarist Mike " Crazy Neck " Sims , multi @-@ instrumentalist Colin Wolfe , DJ Yella and sound engineer Donovan " The Dirt Biker " Sound . Dre is receptive of new ideas from other producers , one example being his fruitful collaboration with Above the Law 's producer Cold 187um while at Ruthless . Cold 187 um was at the time experimenting with 1970s P @-@ Funk samples ( Parliament , Funkadelic , Bootsy Collins , George Clinton etc . ) , that Dre also utilized . Dre has since been accused of " stealing " the concept of G @-@ funk from Cold 187 um . 
 Upon leaving Ruthless and forming Death Row Records in 1991 , Dre called on veteran West Coast DJ Chris " The Glove " Taylor and sound engineer Greg " <unk> " Royal , along with Colin Wolfe , to help him on future projects . His 1992 album The Chronic is thought to be one of the most well @-@ produced hip @-@ hop albums of all time . Musical themes included hard @-@ hitting synthesizer solos played by Wolfe , bass @-@ heavy compositions , background female vocals and Dre fully embracing 1970s funk samples . Dre used a minimoog synth to replay the melody from Leon Haywood 's 1972 song " I Wanna Do Somethin ' Freaky to You " for the Chronic 's first single " Nuthin ' but a " G " Thang " which became a global hit . For his new protégé Snoop Doggy Dogg 's album Doggystyle , Dre collaborated with then 19 @-@ year @-@ old producer Daz Dillinger , who received co @-@ production credits on songs " Serial Killa " and " For all My Niggaz & Bitches " , as well as Warren G and Sam Sneed , who are credited with bringing several samples to the studio . 
 The influence of The Chronic and Doggystyle on the popular music of the 1990s went not only far beyond the West Coast , but beyond hip @-@ hop as a genre . Artists as diverse as Master P ( " Bout It , Bout It " ) , George Michael ( " <unk> " ) , Luis Miguel ( " Dame " ) , and The Spice Girls ( " Say You 'll Be There " ) , used G @-@ funk instrumentation in their songs . Bad Boy Records producer Chucky Thompson stated in the April 2004 issue of XXL magazine that the sound of Doggystyle and the Chronic was the basis for the Notorious B.I.G. ' s 1995 hit single " Big Poppa " : 
 In 1994 , starting with the Murder was the Case soundtrack , Dre attempted to push the boundaries of G @-@ funk further into a darker sound . In songs such as " Murder was the Case " and " Natural Born Killaz " , the synthesizer pitch is higher and the drum tempo is slowed down to 91 BPM ( 87 BPM in the remix ) to create a dark and gritty atmosphere . Percussion instruments , particularly sleigh bells , are also present . Dre 's frequent collaborators from this period included Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania natives Stuart " Stu @-@ B @-@ Doo " Bullard , a multi @-@ instrumentalist from the <unk> Strings Orchestra , Sam Sneed , Stephen " Bud 'da " Anderson , and percussionist Carl " Butch " Small . This style of production has been influential far beyond the West Coast . The beat for the Houston @-@ based group Geto Boys 1996 song " Still " follows the same drum pattern as " Natural Born Killaz " and Eazy E 's " Wut Would U Do " ( a diss to Dre ) is similar to the original " Murder was the Case " instrumental . This style of production is usually accompanied by horror and occult @-@ themed lyrics and imagery , being crucial to the creation of horrorcore . 
 By 1996 , Dre was again looking to innovate his sound . He recruited keyboardist Camara Kambon to play the keys on " Been There , Done That " , and through Bud 'da and Sam Sneed he was introduced to fellow Pittsburgh native Melvin " Mel @-@ Man " Bradford . At this time , he also switched from using the E @-@ mu SP @-@ 1200 to the Akai MPC3000 drum kit and sampler , which he still uses today . Beginning with his 1996 compilation Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath , Dre 's production has taken a less sample @-@ based approach , with loud , layered snare drums dominating the mix , while synthesizers are still omnipresent . In his critically acclaimed sophomore effort , 2001 , live instrumentation takes the place of sampling , a famous example being " The Next Episode " , in which keyboardist Camara Kambon re @-@ played live the main melody from David McCallum 's 1967 jazz @-@ funk work " The Edge " . For every song on 2001 , Dre had a keyboardist , guitarist and bassist create the basic parts of the beat , while he himself programmed the drums , did the sequencing and overdubbing and added sound effects , and later mixed the songs . During this period , Dre 's signature " west coast whistle " riffs are still present albeit in a lower pitch , as in " Light Speed " , " Housewife " , " Some L.A. Niggaz " and Eminem 's " Guilty Conscience " hook . The sound of " 2001 " had tremendous influence on hip @-@ hop production , redefining the West Coast 's sound and expanding the G @-@ funk of the early 1990s . To produce the album , Dre and Mel @-@ Man relied on the talents of Scott Storch and Camara Kambon on the keys , Mike Elizondo and Colin Wolfe on bass guitar , Sean Cruse on lead guitar and sound engineers Richard " Segal " <unk> and Mauricio " Veto " <unk> . 
 From the mid @-@ 2000s , Dr. Dre has taken on a more soulful production style , using more of a classical piano instead of a keyboard , and having claps replace snares , as evidenced in songs such as Snoop Dogg 's " Imagine " and " Boss ' Life " , Busta Rhymes ' " Get You Some " and " Been Through the Storm " , Stat Quo 's " Get Low " and " The Way It Be " , Jay Z 's " Lost One " , Nas ' " Hustlers " , and several beats on Eminem 's Relapse album . Soul and R & B pianist Mark Batson , having previously worked with The Dave Matthews Band , Seal and Maroon 5 has been credited as the architect of this sound . Besides Batson , Aftermath producer and understudy of Dre 's , Dawaun Parker , who has named Q @-@ Tip and J Dilla as his primary influences , is thought to be responsible for giving Dre 's newest beats an East Coast feel . 
 = = = Production equipment = = = 
 Dr. Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the Akai MPC3000 , a drum machine and sampler , and that he often uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording . He cites 1970s funk musicians such as George Clinton , Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as his primary musical influences . Unlike most rap producers , he tries to avoid samples as much as possible , preferring to have studio musicians re @-@ play pieces of music he wants to use , because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo . In 2001 he told Time magazine , " I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me , but I 'd rather use musicians to re @-@ create the sound or elaborate on it . I can control it better . " Other equipment he uses include the E @-@ mu SP @-@ 1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg , Rhodes , Wurlitzer , Moog , and Roland . Dr. Dre also stresses the importance of equalizing drums properly , telling Scratch magazine in 2004 that he " used the same drum sounds on a couple of different songs on one album before but you 'd never be able to tell the difference because of the EQ . " Dr. Dre also uses the digital audio workstation , Pro Tools and uses the software to combine hardware drum machines and vintage analog keyboards and synthesizers . 
 After founding Aftermath Entertainment in 1996 , Dr. Dre took on producer Mel @-@ Man as a co @-@ producer , and his music took on a more synthesizer @-@ based sound , using fewer vocal samples ( as he had used on " Lil ' Ghetto Boy " and " Let Me Ride " on The Chronic , for example ) . Mel @-@ Man has not shared co @-@ production credits with Dr. Dre since approximately 2002 , but fellow Aftermath producer Focus has credited Mel @-@ Man as a key architect of the signature Aftermath sound . 
 In 1999 , Dr. Dre started working with Mike Elizondo , a bassist , guitarist , and keyboardist who has also produced , written and played on records for female singers such as Poe , Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette , In the past few years Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr. Dre 's productions . Dr. Dre also told Scratch magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally , and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies . In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter Burt Bacharach by sending him hip hop beats to play over , and hopes to have an in @-@ person collaboration with him in the future . 
 = = = Work ethic = = = 
 Dr. Dre has stated that he is a perfectionist and is known to pressure the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances . In 2006 , Snoop Dogg told the website <unk> that Dr. Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re @-@ record a single bar of vocals 107 times . Dr. Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist , and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic . He gives a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if it is not to his liking . However , he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record , as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How to Rap . 
 A consequence of his perfectionism is that some artists who initially sign deals with Dr. Dre 's Aftermath label never release albums . In 2001 , Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash , featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as <unk> , <unk> , Joe Beast and Toi . To date , none have released full @-@ length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr. Dre . Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee , 2001 vocalist Hittman , Joell Ortiz , Raekwon and Rakim . 
 = = = Collaborators and co @-@ producers = = = 
 Over the years , word of other collaborators who have contributed to Dr. Dre 's work has surfaced . During his tenure at Death Row Records , it was alleged that Dr. Dre 's stepbrother Warren G and Tha Dogg Pound member Daz made many uncredited contributions to songs on his solo album The Chronic and Snoop Doggy Dogg 's album Doggystyle ( Daz received production credits on Snoop 's similar @-@ sounding , albeit less successful album Tha Doggfather after Young left Death Row Records ) . 
 It is known that Scott Storch , who has since gone on to become a successful producer in his own right , contributed to Dr. Dre 's second album 2001 ; Storch is credited as a songwriter on several songs and played keyboards on several tracks . In 2006 he told Rolling Stone : 
 Current collaborator Mike Elizondo , when speaking about his work with Young , describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians . In 2004 he claimed to Songwriter Universe magazine that he had written the foundations of the hit Eminem song " The Real Slim Shady " , stating , " I initially played a bass line on the song , and Dr. Dre , Tommy Coster Jr. and I built the track from there . Eminem then heard the track , and he wrote the rap to it . " This account is essentially confirmed by Eminem in his book Angry Blonde , stating that the tune for the song was composed by a studio bassist and keyboardist while Dr. Dre was out of the studio but Young later programmed the song 's beat after returning . 
 A group of disgruntled former associates of Dr. Dre complained that they had not received their full due for work on the label in the September 2003 issue of The Source . A producer named Neff @-@ U claimed to have produced the songs " Say What You Say " and " My Dad 's Gone Crazy " on The Eminem Show , the songs " If I Can 't " and " Back Down " on 50 Cent 's Get Rich or Die Tryin ' , and the beat featured on Dr. Dre 's commercial for Coors beer . 
 Although Young studies piano and musical theory , he serves as more of a conductor than a musician himself , as Josh Tyrangiel of TIME magazine has noted : 
 Although Snoop Dogg retains working relationships with Warren G and Daz , who are alleged to be uncredited contributors on the hit albums The Chronic and Doggystyle , he states that Dr. Dre is capable of making beats without the help of collaborators , and that he is responsible for the success of his numerous albums . Dr. Dre 's prominent studio collaborators , including Scott Storch , Elizondo , Mark Batson and Dawaun Parker , have shared co @-@ writing , instrumental , and more recently co @-@ production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer . 
 Anderson <unk> also praised Dr. Dre in a 2016 interview with Music Times , telling the publication that it was a dream come true to work with Dre . 
 = = = Ghostwriters = = = 
 It is acknowledged that most of Dr. Dre 's raps are written for him by others , though he retains ultimate control over his lyrics and the themes of his songs . As Aftermath producer Mahogany told Scratch : " It 's like a class room in [ the booth ] . He 'll have three writers in there . They 'll bring in something , he 'll recite it , then he 'll say . ' Change this line , change this word , ' like he 's grading papers . " As seen in the credits for tracks Young has appeared on , there are often multiple people who contribute to his songs ( although often in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song , even the producer ) . 
 In the book How to Rap , RBX explains that writing The Chronic was a " team effort " and details how he ghostwrote " Let Me Ride " for Dre . In regard to ghostwriting lyrics he says , " Dre doesn 't profess to be no super @-@ duper rap dude – Dre is a super @-@ duper producer " . As a member of N.W.A , The D.O.C. wrote lyrics for him while he stuck with producing . New York City rapper Jay @-@ Z ghostwrote lyrics for the single " Still D.R.E. " from Dr. Dre 's album 2001 .

 = = = Violence against women = = = 
 Dr. Dre has been accused of violence against women in the past . 
 On January 27 , 1991 , at a music industry party at the Po Na Na Souk club in Hollywood , Dr. Dre assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up , because he felt dissatisfied with her news report about the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube . Barnes filed a 22 @.@ 7 million dollar lawsuit in response to the incident . Subsequently , Dr. Dre was fined $ 2 @,@ 500 and given two years ' probation and 240 hours of community service , as well as a spot on an anti @-@ violence public service announcement on television . The civil suit was settled out of court . Barnes stated that Young " began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway . " Dr. Dre later commented " People talk all this shit , but you know , somebody fucks with me , I 'm gonna fuck with them . I just did it , you know . Ain 't nothing you can do now by talking about it . Besides , it ain 't no big thing – I just threw her through a door . " 
 In March 2015 , singer Michel 'le accused him of physical abuse during their time together as a couple , but did not initiate legal action . Former labelmate <unk> B also claimed that Dre assaulted her at a post @-@ Grammy party in 1990 , in response to her track Ruthless Bitch . 
 During press for the popular 2015 film Straight Outta Compton , questions about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women - and the question about its absence in the film - were raised . The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press . In August 2015 , in an interview with Rolling Stone , Dre lamented his abusive past , saying , " I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life . I was young , fucking stupid . I would say all the allegations aren 't true — some of them are . Those are some of the things that I would like to take back . It was really fucked up . But I paid for those mistakes , and there 's no way in hell that I will ever make another mistake like that again . " 
 In a statement to The New York Times on August 21 , 2015 , Dre addressed his abusive past saying , " Twenty @-@ five years ago I was a young man drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life . However , none of this is an excuse for what I did . I 've been married for 19 years and every day I 'm working to be a better man for my family , seeking guidance along the way . I 'm doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again . " He went on to apologise to all the women he abused , saying , " I apologize to the women I 've hurt . I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives . "

Soon after , the duo began teaming with Joey Matthews , later known as Joey Mercury . The trio became known as MNM and on November 10 , Melina managed Mercury and Nitro to win the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship , holding it for over two months . During her time in OVW , Melina , Nitro , and Steven Adkins came up with Melina 's trademark split ring entrance .

The team won the match against Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero , starting their first WWE Tag Team Title reign . 
 While managing the Tag Team Champions , Melina 's character was developed to be more egotistical , as she declared herself " the most @-@ dominant Diva in WWE " . She made her official in @-@ ring debut on June 30 against Michelle McCool , and had her first pay @-@ per @-@ view match against Torrie Wilson at The Great American Bash in a bra and panties match , winning both matches .

 In early and mid @-@ 2007 , Perez had a real @-@ life feud with fellow WWE Diva Candice Michelle in their WWE.com blogs .

She then wrote a blog in April of that year that WWE.com would not publish due to the feelings she expressed towards Perez . Candice took exception to Perez claiming that she had a " spare tire " during an episode of Raw , and in retaliation , Candice claimed Perez was " just jealous " .

 = The X @-@ Files Mythology , Volume 1 – Abduction = 
 Volume 1 of The X @-@ Files Mythology collection is a DVD release containing selected episodes from the first to the third seasons of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . The episodes collected in the release form the beginning of the series ' mythology , and are centred on alien abduction at the hands of " colonists " . Several of the elements introduced in the collected episodes arose through necessity during production , as working around the pregnancy of lead actress Gillian Anderson led to both the creation of unifying plot thread and the introduction of several recurring characters . 
 The episodes in the collection follow the investigations of paranormal @-@ related cases , or X @-@ Files , by FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Anderson ) . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . Events covered in the episodes include the meeting of Mulder and Scully , the introduction and assassination of a secretive informant , the apparent return of Mulder 's lost sister , and the abduction and return of Scully . 
 The collection contains the first episodes in the series ' mythology , or fictional story arcs . When the series began , Chris Carter did not think of creating a " mythology " for the episodes focusing on extraterrestrial life , because he felt that " they were just stories we wanted to tell " . Eventually , however , the writers saw that the most " personal " episodes were those based on the government conspiracy , and , as such , developed more stories based around the conceit . Jerry Hardin , William B. Davis , Mitch Pileggi , Tom Braidwood , Dean Haglund and Bruce Harwood all play supporting roles in the collection . Released on June 7 , 2005 , the collection received generally positive reviews from critics . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) has made a name for himself working on X @-@ Files — unexplained cases which may be paranormal in origin . He is appointed a partner in these investigations — Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) — with his superiors hoping that she will be able to debunk and discredit his work . Their first case together is the investigation of possible abductions in Oregon , which falters when their evidence is destroyed in a fire . A later case , involving the disappearance of a United States Air Force test pilot , sees the introduction of secretive informant Deep Throat ( Jerry Hardin ) , who continues to provide the agents sensitive information . This help is supplemented by conspiracy theorist group The Lone Gunmen , who are contacted for help in a further abduction case . Deep Throat is soon killed , however , when he helps the agents uncover details of a government human cloning program , and the X @-@ Files unit is closed shortly thereafter . 
 Unable to continue his work with Scully , Mulder obtains information about possible extraterrestrial contact in Puerto Rico , finding that the SETI program at the Arecibo Observatory is being forcibly closed . Although the pair are later allowed to resume their work , Scully is later kidnapped by an unhinged multiple alien abductee , Duane Barry . Barry takes Scully to a hilltop where she is then abducted , presumably by aliens . She is found comatose at a later date , having mysteriously arrived at a hospital , and recovers several days later . 
 Mulder receives a call from his father , finding out that his sister Samantha ( Megan Leitch ) , who had been abducted as a child , has returned . Samantha is being pursued by a shapeshifting bounty hunter , who is assassinating human clones . Samantha is killed , although it is revealed that she was simply one of a number of clones , produced using alien tissue to create an alien @-@ human hybrid . 
 The Lone Gunmen contact Mulder and Scully about a successful attempt by a friend of theirs to hack the United States Department of Defense computer system . The hacker , Kenneth Soona ( Bernie Coulson ) , is able to give Mulder the downloaded information on a digital cassette . However , Soona is later assassinated , and the downloaded files are found to be written in Navajo . Contacting Albert Hosteen ( Floyd Red Crow Westerman ) — a Navajo man capable of translating the files — Mulder is shown a box @-@ car full of what appear to be alien corpses . He is trapped in the box @-@ car by the series ' antagonist , The Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) , and left for dead after it is destroyed . He is later found and nursed back to health by Hosteen . Meanwhile , Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation , discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien @-@ human hybrids . Her sister Melissa ( Melinda McGraw ) , however , is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana , and dies in hospital that night .

 When the series began , Chris Carter did not think of creating a " mythology " for the episodes focusing on extraterrestrial life , because he felt that " they were just stories we wanted to tell " . Eventually , however , the writers saw that the most " personal " episodes were those based on the government conspiracy . Another reason for the development of an ongoing mythology was that the producers were afraid of not creating a thread between the episodes centering on the conspiracy , feeling that it would be pretentious not to do so . 
 According to Carter , the mythology " sprung from " the series ' pilot and its follow up , " Deep Throat " , which set up the idea that aliens had been on Earth for many years . Carter sees the final scene of " Deep Throat " as the " launching moment for the entire mythology " . The main theme for the series , stemming from these episodes , is Fox Mulder 's quest to find " the truth " about his sister , Samantha Mulder , who had been abducted as a child . This quest drove the character to investigate the paranormal , setting the framework for the series . 
 After several stand @-@ alone episodes featuring UFOs and extraterrestrials early in the first season , the show 's mythology developed largely based on the pregnancy of actress Gillian Anderson , who became pregnant midway through production of the first season . Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described it as " the best thing that ever happened to the series " , noting that the mythology " really ended up running through the life of the series , all because Gillian Anderson became pregnant " . Although there were initially thoughts about Anderson 's character Scully giving birth to an alien child , ultimately the writers decided to work around Anderson 's pregnancy . The writers decided on closing the X @-@ Files at the end of the season to separate Mulder and Scully from one another , and have Scully abducted , reappearing comatose several episodes later . In addition to the creation of the storyline concerning Scully 's abduction , Anderson 's reduced role in the first half of the second season permitted the writers to develop some of the other characters in the show including Assistant Director Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) , The Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) and X ( Steven Williams ) , and resulted in the introduction of the character Alex Krycek ( Nicholas Lea ) . Krycek , who was initially created by writer Howard Gordon to temporarily replace Scully as Mulder 's partner for three episodes eventually grew into a character that lasted seven seasons on the show . 
 Prior to the second season episode " One Breath " , The Smoking Man mostly " lurked around in the shadows " , providing a " forbidding " presence . The Smoking Man uttered only four audible words in the entire first season of the show , all of them being in " Tooms " . Producer and director R.W. Goodwin did not have faith in William B. Davis ' ability to take on the role of the series ' chief antagonist . It was later revealed to the producers that Davis was running an acting school , and teaching such actors as ninth season guest star Lucy Lawless . 
 In the two @-@ part story of " Colony " and " End Game " , Carter and Spotnitz , along with Duchovny , created what would become a recurring character in the alien bounty hunter . According to Carter , Duchovny came to him and said " it be great if we had like an alien bounty hunter " , an idea of which Carter approved . Spotnitz has noted that the actor cast for the role , Brian Thompson , was chosen because he had a very " distinctive look " about him , most notably his face and mouth .

 Released on June 7 , 2005 , the collection has received generally positive reviews from critics . Slant Magazine 's Keith Uhlich rated it three stars out of five , praising the quality of the episodes included in the set , but ultimately finding that they were best viewed in the context of the " standalone " episodes which were omitted — singling out " Conduit " and " The Jersey Devil " as episodes which would aid the series ' " dual character study " . Writing for IGN , Dan Iverson rated the collection eight out of ten , finding that the mythology @-@ based episodes formed the basis of the relationship between the characters of Mulder and Scully . Making reference to the first season episode " Squeeze " , not included in the collection , he added that " even though people watched the series to see little green men and liver @-@ eating elastic monsters , it was the relationship between the two which made the series a total success " . However , he found that the set 's extra features material was sparse , describing it has being just enough " to keep us from complaining " . Writing for DVD Talk , Jeffrey Robinson was impressed with the collection , finding that the featured episodes worked well together without losing cohesion , and stating that " whether you are a casual viewer or a fan who already owns the season sets , owning The X @-@ Files Mythology , Volume 1 : Abduction is a must " . Exclaim ! ' s Monica S. Kuebler felt negatively about the collection , noting that anyone who would be interested in it would be likely to already own the collected episodes through other releases , and asking " should you buy Abduction ? It all depends on how much five commentaries and a doc are worth to you , because chances are , if you love the X @-@ Files ... you 've probably already bought the episodes included here at least once " .

 HMS Grenville was the flotilla leader for the G @-@ class destroyers , built for the Royal Navy in the mid @-@ 1930s . She spent most of the pre @-@ war period as part of the Mediterranean Fleet . The ship was transferred to the British Isles to escort shipping in local waters shortly after the beginning of World War II . In January 1940 , Grenville struck a mine outside the Thames Estuary and sank with the loss of 77 of her crew .

 Grenville displaced 1 @,@ 455 long tons ( 1 @,@ 478 t ) at standard load and 2 @,@ 053 long tons ( 2 @,@ 086 t ) at deep load .

She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 38 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 28 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Yarrow side @-@ fired , water @-@ tube boilers . Grenville carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 530 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 240 km ; 6 @,@ 360 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 175 officers and men . 
 The ship mounted five 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) Mark IX guns in single mounts . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Grenville had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began .

 Ordered in 1934 , the ship was laid down by the Yarrow Shipbuilding Company at Scotstoun in Glasgow on 29 September 1934 , launched on 15 August 1935 , and completed on 1 July 1936 . Excluding government @-@ furnished equipment like the armament , the ship cost £ 275 @,@ 412 . Aside from a brief period when she was assigned to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla after her commissioning , Grenville spent the prewar period as the flagship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet . She spent ten months deployed off the Spanish coast in the Western Mediterranean during the Spanish Civil War before returning to Portsmouth for a brief overhaul between 24 May and 9 June 1937 . The ship returned to the Mediterranean until she was given a more thorough refit in Portsmouth between 7 June and 25 July 1938 . 
 On the outbreak of war in September 1939 , Grenville was deployed in the Mediterranean . On 22 October , Grenville and her sisters Griffin , Grenade and Gipsy were transferred to the Western Approaches Command and arrived at Plymouth on 2 November . Grenville and Grenade collided during the night of 7 / 8 November and Grenville 's No. 3 boiler room was flooded . She was under repair at HM Dockyard , Devonport until 1 December . While the ship was under repair , her flotilla had been transferred to the Nore Command at Harwich for local patrol and escort work . Grenville rejoined them the on 3 December and participated in several attempts to intercept enemy shipping traffic off the Dutch and German North Sea coasts . Whilst returning from one of these missions on 19 January Grenville struck a mine 23 miles ( 37 km ) east of Kentish Knock Light Vessel . Seventy @-@ seven of the ship 's company were killed as the ship sank .

 The European Union ( EU ) is a politico @-@ economic union of 28 member states that are located primarily in Europe . It has an area of 4 @,@ 324 @,@ 782 km2 ( 1 @,@ 669 @,@ 808 sq mi ) , and an estimated population of over 510 million . The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states . EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people , goods , services , and capital within the internal market , enact legislation in justice and home affairs , and maintain common policies on trade , agriculture , fisheries , and regional development . Within the Schengen Area , passport controls have been abolished . A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002 , and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency . 
 The EU operates through a hybrid system of supranational and intergovernmental decision @-@ making . The seven principal decision @-@ making bodies — known as the institutions of the European Union — are the European Council , the Council of the European Union , the European Parliament , the European Commission , the Court of Justice of the European Union , the European Central Bank , and the European Court of Auditors . 
 The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) and the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , formed by the Inner Six countries in 1951 and 1958 , respectively . The community and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit . While no member state has , as yet , ever left the EU , a non @-@ binding referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016 supported leaving . The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union in 1993 and introduced European citizenship . The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU , the Treaty of Lisbon , came into force in 2009 . 
 Covering 7 @.@ 3 % of the world population , the EU in 2014 generated a nominal gross domestic product ( GDP ) of 18 @.@ 495 trillion US dollars , constituting approximately 24 % of global nominal GDP and 17 % when measured in terms of purchasing power parity . Additionally , 26 out of 28 EU countries have a very high Human Development Index , according to the United Nations Development Program . In 2012 , the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy , the EU has developed a role in external relations and defence . The union maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations , the World Trade Organization , the G8 , and the G @-@ 20 . Because of its global influence , the European Union has been described as a current or as a potential superpower .

 After World War II , European integration was seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which had devastated the continent . The 1948 Hague Congress was a pivotal moment in European federal history , as it led to the creation of the European Movement International and of the College of Europe , where Europe 's future leaders would live and study together . 1952 saw the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community , which was declared to be " a first step in the federation of Europe . " The supporters of the Community included Alcide De Gasperi , Jean Monnet , Robert Schuman , and Paul @-@ Henri Spaak . 
 = = = Treaty of Rome ( 1957 – 92 ) = = = 
 In 1957 , Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome , which created the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and established a customs union . They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community ( Euratom ) for co @-@ operation in developing nuclear energy . Both treaties came into force in 1958 . 
 The EEC and Euratom were created separately from ECSC , although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly . The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein ( Hallstein Commission ) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand ( Armand Commission ) and then Étienne Hirsch . Euratom was to integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union among members . 
 Through the 1960s , tensions began to show , with France seeking to limit supranational power . Nevertheless , in 1965 an agreement was reached and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities , which were collectively referred to as the European Communities . Jean Rey presided over the first merged Commission ( Rey Commission ) . 
 In 1973 , the Communities enlarged to include Denmark ( including Greenland , which later left the Community in 1985 , following a dispute over fishing rights ) , Ireland , and the United Kingdom . Norway had negotiated to join at the same time , but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum . In 1979 , the first direct elections to the European Parliament were held . 
 Greece joined in 1981 , Portugal and Spain following in 1986 . In 1985 , the Schengen Agreement paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non @-@ member states . In 1986 , the European flag began to be used by the Community and the Single European Act was signed . 
 In 1990 , after the fall of the Eastern Bloc , the former East Germany became part of the Community as part of a reunified Germany . With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states , as well as Cyprus and Malta , the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993 . 
 = = = Maastricht Treaty ( 1992 – present ) = = = 
 The European Union was formally established when the Maastricht Treaty — whose main architects were Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand — came into force on 1 November 1993 . The treaty also gave the name European Community to the EEC , even if it was referred as such before the treaty . In 1995 , Austria , Finland , and Sweden joined the EU . In 2002 , euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states . Since then , the eurozone has increased to encompass 19 countries . In 2004 , the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , Poland , Slovakia and Slovenia joined the Union . In 2007 , Romania and Bulgaria became EU members . The same year , Slovenia adopted the euro , followed in 2008 by Cyprus and Malta , by Slovakia in 2009 , by Estonia in 2011 , by Latvia in 2014 and by Lithuania in 2015 . 
 On 1 December 2009 , the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU . In particular , it changed the legal structure of the European Union , merging the EU three pillars system into a single legal entity provisioned with a legal personality , created a permanent President of the European Council , the first of which was Herman Van Rompuy , and strengthened the position of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . In 2012 , the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for having " contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation , democracy , and human rights in Europe . " In 2013 , Croatia became the 28th EU member . 
 From the beginning of 2010s , the European Union is going through a series of tests , including a debt crisis in some Eurozone countries , increasing migration from Middle Eastern countries , Russian military intervention in Ukraine and the United Kingdom 's withdrawal from the EU .

The landscape , climate , and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline , which is 65 @,@ 993 kilometres ( 41 @,@ 006 mi ) long . 
 Including the overseas territories of France which are located outside the continent of Europe , but which are members of the union , the EU experiences most types of climate from Arctic ( North @-@ East Europe ) to tropical ( French Guyana ) , rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless . The majority of the population lives in areas with a temperate maritime climate ( North @-@ Western Europe and Central Europe ) , a Mediterranean climate ( Southern Europe ) , or a warm summer continental or hemiboreal climate ( Northern Balkans and Central Europe ) . 
 The EU 's population is highly urbanised , with some 75 % of inhabitants ( and growing , projected to be 90 % in seven member states by 2020 ) living in urban areas . Cities are largely spread out across the EU , although with a large grouping in and around the Benelux . An increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas . In some cases , this urban growth has been due to the influx of EU funds into a region . 
 = = = Member states = = = 
 Through successive enlargements , the European Union has grown from the six founding states — Belgium , France , West Germany , Italy , Luxembourg , and the Netherlands — to the current 28 . Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding treaties , thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership . This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions , a practice often referred to as " pooling of sovereignty " . 
 To become a member , a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria , defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen . These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law ; a functioning market economy ; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership , including EU law . Evaluation of a country 's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council . No member state has yet left the Union , although Greenland ( an autonomous province of Denmark ) withdrew in 1985 . The Lisbon Treaty now contains a clause under Article 50 , providing for a member to leave the EU . On 23 June 2016 , the United Kingdom voted by referendum to leave the EU . However , it remains a member until it officially exits , and has not yet begun formal withdrawal procedures . 
 There are six countries that are recognized as candidates for membership : Albania , Iceland , Macedonia , Montenegro , Serbia , and Turkey , though Iceland suspended negotiations in 2013 . Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are officially recognised as potential candidates , with Bosnia and Herzegovina having submitted a membership application . 
 The four countries forming the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) are not EU members , but have partly committed to the EU 's economy and regulations : Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway , which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area , and Switzerland , which has similar ties through bilateral treaties . The relationships of the European microstates , Andorra , Monaco , San Marino , and the Vatican include the use of the euro and other areas of co @-@ operation . The following 28 sovereign states ( of which the map only shows territories situated in and around Europe ) constitute the European Union : 
 = = = Environment = = = 
 In 1957 , when the EEC was founded , it had no environmental policy . Over the past 50 years , an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created , extending to all areas of environmental protection , including air pollution , water quality , waste management , nature conservation , and the control of chemicals , industrial hazards and biotechnology . According to the Institute for European Environmental Policy , environmental law comprises over 500 Directives , Regulations and Decisions , making environmental policy a core area of European politics . 
 European policy @-@ makers originally increased the EU 's capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem . Trade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state . In subsequent years , the environment became a formal policy area , with its own policy actors , principles and procedures . The legal basis for EU environmental policy was established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987 . 
 Initially , EU environmental policy focused on Europe . More recently , the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance , e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol despite opposition from the United States . This international dimension is reflected in the EU 's Sixth Environmental Action Programme , which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide . The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions . EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe , as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management . 
 Mitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of EU environmental policy . In 2007 , member states agreed that , in future , 20 % of the energy used across the EU must be renewable , and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20 % compared to 1990 levels . The EU has adopted an emissions trading system to incorporate carbon emissions into the economy . The European Green Capital is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment , energy efficiency and quality of life in urban areas to create smart city . 
 = = Politics = = 
 The European Union operates according to the principles of conferral ( which says that it should act only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the treaties ) and of subsidiarity ( which says that it should act only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone ) . Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms . Generally speaking , they can be classified into two groups : those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures ( regulations ) and those which specifically require national implementation measures ( directives ) . 
 = = = Constitutional nature = = = 
 The classification of the EU in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated . It began life as an international organisation and gradually developed into a confederation of states . However , since the mid @-@ 1960s it has also added several of the key attributes of a federation , such as the direct effect of the law of the general level of government upon the individual and majority voting in the decision @-@ making process of the general level of government , without becoming a federation per se . Scholars thus today see it as an intermediate form lying between a confederation and a federation , being an instance of neither political structure . For this reason , the organisation is termed sui generis ( incomparable , one of a kind ) , although some argue that this designation is no longer valid . 
 The organisation has traditionally used the terms " Community " and later " Union " to describe itself . The difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law ( where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations ) and international law ( where the subjects include sovereign states and international organizations ) . They can also be seen in the light of differing European and American constitutional traditions . Especially in terms of the European tradition , the term federation is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law ; so the EU cannot be called a federation — at least , not without qualification . It is , however , described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature ; and so it may be appropriate to consider it a federal union of states , a conceptual structure lying between the confederation of states and the federal state . The German Constitutional Court refers to the EU as a <unk> , an intermediate structure between the <unk> ( confederation of states ) and the <unk> ( federal state ) , consistent with this concept . This may be a long @-@ lived political form . Professor Andrew Moravcsik claims that the EU is unlikely to develop further into a federal state , but instead has reached maturity as a constitutional system . 
 = = = Governance = = = 
 The European Union has seven institutions : the European Council , the Council of the European Union , the European Parliament , the European Commission , the Court of Justice of the European Union , the European Central Bank and the European Court of Auditors . Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament , while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council ( not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union ) . The monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank . The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union . The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors . There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area . 
 = = = = European Council = = = = 
 The European Council gives political direction to the EU . It convenes at least four times a year and comprises the President of the European Council ( currently Donald Tusk ) , the President of the European Commission and one representative per member state ( either its head of state or head of government ) . The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy ( currently Federica <unk> ) also takes part in its meetings . It has been described by some as the Union 's " supreme political authority " . It is actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the EU 's policy agenda and strategies . 
 The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions , and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies . It acts externally as a " collective head of state " and ratifies important documents ( for example , international agreements and treaties ) . 
 Tasks for the President of the European Council are ensuring the external representation of the EU , driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states , both during meetings of the European Council and over the periods between them . 
 The European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe , an international organisation independent of the EU based in Strasbourg . 
 = = = = Council of the European Union = = = = 
 The Council of the European Union ( also called the " Council " and the " Council of Ministers " , its former title ) forms one half of the EU 's legislature . It consists of a government minister from each member state and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed . Notwithstanding its different configurations , it is considered to be one single body . In addition to its legislative functions , the Council also exercises executive functions in relations to the Common Foreign and Security Policy . 
 = = = = European Parliament = = = = 
 The European Parliament forms the other half of the EU 's legislature . The 751 Members of the European Parliament ( MEPs ) are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation . Although MEPs are elected on a national basis , they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality . Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub @-@ national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system . 
 The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure . This also applies to the EU budget . The European Commission is accountable to Parliament , requiring its approval to take office , having to report back to it and subject to motions of censure from it . The President of the European Parliament ( currently Martin Schulz ) carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally . The President and Vice @-@ Presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years . 
 = = = = European Commission = = = = 
 The European Commission acts as the EU 's executive arm and is responsible for initiating legislation and the day @-@ to @-@ day running of the EU . The Commission is also seen as the motor of European integration . It operates as a cabinet government , with 28 Commissioners for different areas of policy , one from each member state , though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state . 
 One of the 28 is the President of the European Commission ( currently Jean @-@ Claude Juncker ) appointed by the European Council . After the President , the most prominent Commissioner is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , who is ex @-@ officio a Vice @-@ President of the Commission and is also chosen by the European Council . The other 26 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the Council of the European Union in agreement with the nominated President . The 28 Commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament . 
 = = = Budget = = = 
 The EU had an agreed budget of € 120 @.@ 7 billion for the year 2007 and € 864 @.@ 3 billion for the period 2007 – 2013 , representing 1 @.@ 10 % and 1 @.@ 05 % of the EU @-@ 27 's GNI forecast for the respective periods . By comparison , the United Kingdom 's expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be € 759 billion , and France was estimated to have spent € 801 billion . In 1960 , the budget of the then European Economic Community was 0 @.@ 03 % of GDP . 
 In the 2010 budget of € 141 @.@ 5 billion , the largest single expenditure item is " cohesion & competitiveness " with around 45 % of the total budget . Next comes " agriculture " with approximately 31 % of the total . " Rural development , environment and fisheries " takes up around 11 % . " Administration " accounts for around 6 % . The " EU as a global partner " and " citizenship , freedom , security and justice " bring up the rear with approximately 6 % and 1 % respectively . 
 The Court of Auditors is legally obliged to provide the Parliament and the Council with " a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions " . The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti @-@ fraud actions . The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission 's handling of the budget . 
 The European Court of Auditors has signed off the European Union accounts every year since 2007 and , while making it clear that the European Commission has more work to do , has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level . In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure , agriculture and the cohesion fund , were materially affected by error . The European Commission estimated in 2009 that the financial impact of irregularities was € 1 @,@ 863 million . 
 = = = Competences = = = 
 EU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union . In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence . These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation . In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate . While both can legislate , member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not . In other policy areas the EU can only co @-@ ordinate , support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws . 
 That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area . Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence , and even with the same policy area . 
 The distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories : 
 = = Legal system = = 
 The EU is based on a series of treaties . These first established the European Community and the EU , and then made amendments to those founding treaties . These are power @-@ giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals . These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants . The EU has legal personality , with the right to sign agreements and international treaties . 
 Under the principle of supremacy , national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified , and thus the laws enacted under them , even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law , and ( within limits ) even constitutional provisions . 
 = = = Courts of Justice = = = 
 The judicial branch of the EU — formally called the Court of Justice of the European Union — consists of three courts : the Court of Justice , the General Court , and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal . Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU . 
 The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states , the institutions , and cases referred to it by the courts of member states . The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU 's courts , and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and its civil service . Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law . 
 = = = Fundamental rights = = = 
 The treaties declare that the EU itself is " founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities ... in a society in which pluralism , non @-@ discrimination , tolerance , justice , solidarity and equality between women and men prevail . " 
 In 2009 the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union . The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU 's legal acts can be judged . It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the " constitutional traditions common to the member states . " The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has , on occasion , invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights . 
 Although signing the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR ) is a condition for EU membership , previously , the EU itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a state nor had the competence to accede . The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this : the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it . 
 Although , the EU is independent from Council of Europe , they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law , human rights and democracy . Further European Convention on Human Rights and European Social Charter , the source of law of Charter of Fundamental Rights are created by Council of Europe . The EU also promoted human rights issues in the wider world . The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition . Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership . 
 = = = Acts = = = 
 The main legal acts of the EU come in three forms : regulations , directives , and decisions . Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force , without the requirement for any implementing measures , and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions . Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result . The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states . When the time limit for implementing directives passes , they may , under certain conditions , have direct effect in national law against member states . 
 Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation . They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals , companies or a particular member state . They are most often used in competition law , or on rulings on State Aid , but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions . Regulations , directives , and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy . 
 = = = Area of freedom , security and justice = = = 
 Since the creation of the EU in 1993 , it has developed its competencies in the area of freedom , security and justice , initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism . To this end , agencies have been established that co @-@ ordinate associated actions : Europol for co @-@ operation of police forces , <unk> for co @-@ operation between prosecutors , and Frontex for co @-@ operation between border control authorities . The EU also operates the Schengen Information System which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities . This co @-@ operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the Schengen Agreement and the associated cross border crime . 
 Furthermore , the Union has legislated in areas such as extradition , family law , asylum law , and criminal justice . Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties . In more recent years , these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race , religion , disability , age , and sexual orientation . By virtue of these powers , the EU has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work @-@ place , age discrimination , and racial discrimination . 
 = = Foreign relations = = 
 Foreign policy co @-@ operation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957 , when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the Common Commercial policy . Steps for a more wide ranging co @-@ ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies . It was not , however , until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act . EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) by the Maastricht Treaty . 
 The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU 's own interests and those of the international community as a whole , including the furtherance of international co @-@ operation , respect for human rights , democracy , and the rule of law . The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue . The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements , such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq . 
 The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters , and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment . The High Representative heads up the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) , a unique EU department that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon . The EEAS will serve as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the European Union . 
 Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union , the international influence of the EU is also felt through enlargement . The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU 's accession criteria , and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries . This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as " soft power " , as opposed to military " hard power " . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 The predecessors of the European Union were not devised as a military alliance because NATO was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes . 22 EU members are members of NATO while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality . The Western European Union , a military alliance with a mutual defence clause , was disbanded in 2010 as its role had been transferred to the EU . 
 According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( SIPRI ) , the United Kingdom spent $ 61 billion on defence in 2014 , placing it fifth in the world , while France spent $ 53 billion , the sixth largest . Together , the UK and France account for approximately 40 per cent of EU 's defence budget and 50 per cent of its military capacity . Both are officially recognised nuclear weapon states holding permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council . 
 Following the Kosovo War in 1999 , the European Council agreed that " the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action , backed by credible military forces , the means to decide to use them , and the readiness to do so , in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO " . To that end , a number of efforts were made to increase the EU 's military capability , notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process . After much discussion , the most concrete result was the EU Battlegroups initiative , each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500 personnel . 
 EU forces have been deployed on peacekeeping missions from middle and northern Africa to the western Balkans and western Asia . EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies , including the European Defence Agency , European Union Satellite Centre and the European Union Military Staff . Frontex is an agency of the EU established to manage the cooperation between national border guards securing its external borders . It aims to detect and stop illegal immigration , human trafficking and terrorist infiltration . In December 2015 the European Commission presented its proposal for a new European Border and Coast Guard Agency having a stronger role and mandate along with national authorities for border management . In an EU consisting of 28 members , substantial security and defence co @-@ operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states . 
 = = = Humanitarian aid = = = 
 The European Commission 's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department , or " ECHO " , provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries . In 2012 , its budget amounted to € 874 million , 51 % of the budget went to Africa and 20 % to Asia , Latin America , the Caribbean and Pacific , and 20 % to the Middle East and Mediterranean . 
 Humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget ( 70 % ) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund ( 30 % ) . The EU 's external action financing is divided into ' geographic ' instruments and ' thematic ' instruments . The ' geographic ' instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument ( DCI , € 16 @.@ 9 billion , 2007 – 2013 ) , which must spend 95 % of its budget on overseas development assistance ( ODA ) , and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument ( <unk> ) , which contains some relevant programmes . The European Development Fund ( EDF , € 22 @.@ 7 bn , 2008 – 2013 ) is made up of voluntary contributions by member states , but there is pressure to merge the EDF into the budget @-@ financed instruments to encourage increased contributions to match the 0 @.@ 7 % target and allow the European Parliament greater oversight . 
 However , five countries have reached the 0 @.@ 7 % target : Sweden , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Denmark and the United Kingdom . In 2011 , EU aid was 0 @.@ 42 % of the EU 's GNI making it the world 's most generous aid donor . The previous Commissioner for Aid , Louis Michel , has called for aid to be delivered more rapidly , to greater effect , and on humanitarian principles . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The European Union has established a single market across the territory of all its members representing 508 million citizens . In 2014 , the EU had a combined GDP of 18 @.@ 640 trillion international dollars , a 20 % share of global gross domestic product by purchasing power parity ( PPP ) . As a political entity the European Union is represented in the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) . EU member states own the estimated largest net wealth in the world , equal to 30 % of the $ 223 trillion global wealth . 
 19 member states have joined a monetary union known as the eurozone , which uses the Euro as a single currency . The currency union represents 338 million EU citizens . The euro is the second largest reserve currency as well as the second most traded currency in the world after the United States dollar . 
 Of the top 500 largest corporations in the world measured by revenue in 2010 , 161 have their headquarters in the EU . In 2016 , unemployment in the EU stood at 8 @.@ 9 % while inflation was at 2 @.@ 2 % , and the current account balance at − 0 @.@ 9 % of GDP . 
 There is a significant variance for GDP ( PPP ) per capita within individual EU states . The difference between the richest and poorest regions ( 276 NUTS @-@ 2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics ) ranged , in 2014 , from 30 % of the <unk> average to 539 % , or from € 8 @,@ 200 to € 148 @,@ 000 ( about US $ 9 @,@ 000 to US $ 162 @,@ 000 ) . 
 Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds are supporting the development of underdeveloped regions of the EU . Such regions are primarily located in the states of central and southern Europe . Several funds provide emergency aid , support for candidate members to transform their country to conform to the EU 's standard ( Phare , <unk> , and <unk> ) , and support to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( <unk> ) . <unk> has now become part of the worldwide <unk> programme . EU research and technological framework programmes sponsor research conducted by consortia from all EU members to work towards a single European Research Area . 
 = = = Internal market = = = 
 Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market , subsequently becoming a single market , and a customs union between its member states . The single market involves the free circulation of goods , capital , people , and services within the EU , and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market . Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties , discriminatory taxes or import quotas , as they travel internally . The non @-@ EU member states of Iceland , Norway , Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union . Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU . 
 Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries . Until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow . Post @-@ Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of <unk> judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom . The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non @-@ member states . 
 The free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live , work , study or retire in another country . This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states . 
 The free movement of services and of establishment allows self @-@ employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis . While services account for 60 – 70 % of GDP , legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas . This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed Directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services . According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised . 
 = = = Monetary union = = = 
 The creation of a European single currency became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969 . In 1992 , having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union , the member states signed the Maastricht Treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed @-@ on rules including the convergence criteria if they wanted to join the monetary union . The states wanting to participate had first to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism . 
 In 1999 the currency union started , first as an accounting currency with eleven member states joining . In 2002 , the currency was fully put into place , when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone , which by then consisted of 12 member states . The eurozone ( constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro ) has since grown to 19 countries . 
 Since its launch the euro has become the second reserve currency in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro . The euro , and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU , are under the control of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) . 
 The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone , and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability . It is at the centre of the European System of Central Banks , which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council , consisting of the President of the ECB , who is appointed by the European Council , the Vice @-@ President of the ECB , and the governors of the national central banks of all 28 EU member states . 
 The European System of Financial Supervision is an institutional architecture of the EU 's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities : the European Banking Authority , the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority . To complement this framework , there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the ECB . The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU . 
 To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union , they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures , especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence , as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level . 
 = = = Energy = = = 
 In 2006 , the EU @-@ 27 had a gross inland energy consumption of 1 @,@ 825 million tonnes of oil equivalent ( toe ) . Around 46 % of the energy consumed was produced within the member states while 54 % was imported . In these statistics , nuclear energy is treated as primary energy produced in the EU , regardless of the source of the uranium , of which less than 3 % is produced in the EU . 
 The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence ; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community . The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005 , and the first draft policy was published in January 2007 . 
 The EU has five key points in its energy policy : increase competition in the internal market , encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids ; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis ; establish a new treaty framework for energy co @-@ operation with Russia while improving relations with energy @-@ rich states in Central Asia and North Africa ; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation ; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies . 
 The EU imports 82 % of its oil , 57 % of its natural gas and 97 @.@ 48 % of its uranium demands . Because of Europe 's dependence on Russian energy the EU is attempting to diversify its energy supply . 
 = = = Infrastructure = = = 
 The EU is working to improve cross @-@ border infrastructure within the EU , for example through the Trans @-@ European Networks ( TEN ) . Projects under TEN include the Channel Tunnel , LGV Est , the Fréjus Rail Tunnel , the Öresund Bridge , the Brenner Base Tunnel and the Strait of Messina Bridge . In 2010 the estimated network covers : 75 @,@ 200 kilometres ( 46 @,@ 700 mi ) of roads ; 78 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 48 @,@ 000 mi ) of railways ; 330 airports ; 270 maritime harbours ; and 210 internal harbours . 
 Rail transport in Europe is being synchronised with the European Rail Traffic Management System ( ERTMS ) , an initiative to greatly enhance safety , increase efficiency of trains and enhance cross @-@ border interoperability of rail transport in Europe by replacing signalling equipment with digitized mostly wireless versions and by creating a single Europe @-@ wide standard for train control and command systems . 
 The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network . In the pre @-@ 2004 EU members , the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution . After the recent enlargement , the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda . The Polish road network was upgraded such as the A4 <unk> . 
 The Galileo positioning system is another EU infrastructure project . Galileo is a proposed Satellite navigation system , to be built by the EU and launched by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) . The Galileo project was launched partly to reduce the EU 's dependency on the US @-@ operated Global Positioning System , but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for greater accuracy , given the aged nature of the GPS system . 
 = = = Agriculture = = = 
 The Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) is one of the long lasting policies of the European Community . The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production , providing certainty in food supplies , ensuring a high quality of life for farmers , stabilising markets , and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers . It was , until recently , operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention . Until the 1990s , the policy accounted for over 60 % of the then European Community 's annual budget , and as of 2013 accounts for around 34 % . 
 The policy 's price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction . These were intervention stores of products bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels . To dispose of surplus stores , they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices , or farmers were offered subsidies ( amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices ) to export their products outside the Community . This system has been criticised for under @-@ cutting farmers outside Europe , especially those in the developing world . Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living . 
 Since the beginning of the 1990s , the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms . Initially , these reforms included the introduction of set @-@ aside in 1988 , where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production , milk quotas and , more recently , the ' de @-@ coupling ' ( or disassociation ) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce ( by the Fischler reforms in 2004 ) . Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce , toward direct payments based on farm size . This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels . One of these reforms entailed the abolition of the EU 's sugar regime , which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African @-@ Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU . 
 = = = Competition = = = 
 The EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market . The Commission as the competition regulator for the single market is responsible for antitrust issues , approving mergers , breaking up cartels , working for economic liberalisation and preventing state aid . 
 The Competition Commissioner , currently Margrethe <unk> , is one of the most powerful positions in the Commission , notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of trans @-@ national corporations . For example , in 2001 the Commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States ( GE and Honeywell ) which had already been approved by their national authority .

 = = = Languages = = = 
 Among the many languages and dialects used in the EU , it has 24 official and working languages : Bulgarian , Croatian , Czech , Danish , Dutch , English , Estonian , Finnish , French , German , Greek , Hungarian , Italian , Irish , Latvian , Lithuanian , Maltese , Polish , Portuguese , Romanian , Slovak , Slovene , Spanish , and Swedish . Important documents , such as legislation , are translated into every official language . 
 The European Parliament provides translation into all languages for documents and its plenary sessions . Some institutions use only a handful of languages as internal working languages . Catalan , Galician , Basque , Scottish Gaelic and Welsh are not official languages of the EU but have semi @-@ official status in that official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens of the EU have the right to correspond with the institutions using them . 
 Language policy is the responsibility of member states , but EU institutions promote the learning of other languages . English is the most widely spoken language in the EU , being spoken by 51 % of the EU population when counting both native and non @-@ native speakers . German is the most widely spoken mother tongue , being spoken by 16 % of the EU population . 56 % of EU citizens are able to engage in a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue . Most official languages of the EU belong to the Indo @-@ European language family , except Estonian , Finnish , and Hungarian , which belong to the Uralic language family , and Maltese , which is a Semitic language . Most EU official languages are written in the Latin alphabet except Bulgarian , which is written in the Cyrillic alphabet , and Greek , which is written in the Greek alphabet . These are the three official scripts of the European Union . 
 Besides the 24 official languages , there are about 150 regional and minority languages , spoken by up to 50 million people . Although EU programmes can support regional and minority languages , the protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the individual member states . The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage . 
 The European Day of Languages is held annually on 26 September and is aimed at encouraging language learning across Europe . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 The EU is a secular body with no formal connection to any religion . The Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recognises the " status under national law of churches and religious associations " as well as that of " philosophical and non @-@ confessional organisations " . 
 The preamble to the Treaty on European Union mentions the " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of Europe " . Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention Christianity or God , or both , in the preamble of the text , but the idea faced opposition and was dropped . 
 Christians in the EU are divided among members of Catholicism ( both Roman and Eastern Rite ) , numerous Protestant denominations , and the Eastern Orthodox Church . In 2009 , the EU had an estimated Muslim population of 13 million , and an estimated Jewish population of over a million . The other world religions of Buddhism , Hinduism and Sikhism are also represented in the EU population . 
 According to new polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer , Christianity is the largest religion in the European Union , accounting for 72 % of the EU population . Catholics are the largest Christian group , accounting for 48 % of the EU population , while Protestants make up 12 % , Eastern Orthodox make up 8 % and other Christians make up 4 % . 
 Eurostat 's Eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52 % of EU citizens believed in a God , 27 % in " some sort of spirit or life force " , and 18 % had no form of belief . Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years . The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia ( 16 % ) and the Czech Republic ( 19 % ) . The most religious countries were Malta ( 95 % , predominantly Roman Catholic ) as well as Cyprus and Romania ( both predominantly Orthodox ) each with about 90 % of citizens professing a belief in God . Across the EU , belief was higher among women , older people , those with religious upbringing , those who left school at 15 or 16 and those " positioning themselves on the right of the political scale " . 
 = = = Education and science = = = 
 Basic education is an area where the EU 's role is limited to supporting national governments . In higher education , the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility . The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme , a university exchange programme which began in 1987 . In its first 20 years , it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1 @.@ 5 million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life . 
 There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers , for trainees in vocational education and training , and for adult learners in the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007 – 2013 . These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU . Through its support of the Bologna Process , the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe . 
 Scientific development is facilitated through the EU 's Framework Programmes , the first of which started in 1984 . The aims of EU policy in this area are to co @-@ ordinate and stimulate research . The independent European Research Council allocates EU funds to European or national research projects . EU research and technological framework programmes deal in a number of areas , for example energy where the aim is to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy to help the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels . 
 = = = Health care = = = 
 Although the EU has no major competences in the field of health care , Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms that " A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities " . The European Commission 's Directorate @-@ General for Health and Consumers seeks to align national laws on the protection of people 's health , on the consumers ' rights , on the safety of food and other products . 
 Health care in the EU is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level . The systems are primarily publicly funded through taxation ( universal health care ) . Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non @-@ taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private ( non @-@ subsidised ) health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance . 
 All EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free European Health Insurance Card which , on a reciprocal basis , provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries . A directive on cross @-@ border healthcare aims at promoting co @-@ operation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high @-@ quality cross @-@ border healthcare for European patients . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Cultural co @-@ operation between member states has been a concern of the EU since its inclusion as a community competency in the Maastricht Treaty . Actions taken in the cultural area by the EU include the Culture 2000 7 @-@ year programme , the European Cultural Month event , the <unk> Programme , and orchestras such as the European Union Youth Orchestra . 
 The European Capital of Culture programme selects one or more cities in every year to assist the cultural development of that city . 53 EU cities have been part of this initiative up to 2016 . 
 = = = Sport = = = 
 Sport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations , rather than of the EU . However , there are some EU policies that have had an impact on sport , such as the free movement of workers , which was at the core of the Bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship . The Treaty of Lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity . This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA , due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport , which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs . The EU does fund a programme for Israeli , Jordanian , Irish , and British football coaches , as part of the Football 4 Peace project . 
 Association Football is the most popular sport in almost all EU countries . Club teams from the EU are the highest paid in the world . Other team sports like rugby , ice hockey , basketball , cricket , handball , volleyball and water polo are also popular in some member states . 
 = = = Symbols = = = 
 The flag of the Union consists of a circle of 12 golden stars on a blue background . The blue represents the West , while the number and position of the stars represent completeness and unity , respectively . Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe , the flag was adopted by the European Communities , the predecessors of the present Union , in 1986 . 
 United in Diversity was adopted as the motto of the Union in the year 2000 , having been selected from proposals submitted by school pupils . Since 1985 , the flag day of the Union has been Europe Day , on 9 May ( the date of the 1950 Schuman declaration ) . The anthem of the Union is an instrumental version of the prelude to the Ode to Joy , the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven 's ninth symphony . The anthem was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985 and has since been played on official occasions . 
 Besides naming the continent , the Greek mythological figure of Europa has frequently been employed as a personification of Europe . Known from the myth in which Zeus seduces her in the guise of a white bull , Europa has also been referred to in relation to the present Union . Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the Union 's institutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of Euro banknotes . The bull is , for its part , depicted on all residence permit cards . 
 Charles the Great , also known as Charlemagne ( Latin : Carolus Magnus ) and later recognized as Pater Europae ( " Father of Europe " ) , has a symbolic relevance to Europe . The Commission has named one of its central buildings in Brussels after Charlemagne and the city of Aachen has since 1949 awarded the Charlemagne Prize to champions of European unification . Since 2008 , the organisers of this prize , in conjunction with the European Parliament , have awarded the Charlemagne Youth Prize in recognition of similar efforts by young people .

 Media freedom is a fundamental right that applies to all member states of the European Union and its citizens , as defined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as well as the European Convention on Human Rights . Within the EU enlargement process , guaranteeing media freedom is named a " key indicator of a country 's readiness to become part of the EU " . 
 = Mediterranean campaign of 1798 = 
 The Mediterranean campaign of 1798 was a series of major naval operations surrounding a French expeditionary force sent to Egypt under Napoleon Bonaparte during the French Revolutionary Wars . The French Republic sought to capture Egypt as the first stage in an effort to threaten British India , and thus force Great Britain to make peace . Departing Toulon in May 1798 with over 40 @,@ 000 troops and hundreds of ships , Bonaparte 's fleet sailed southeastwards across the Mediterranean Sea . They were followed by a small British squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson , later reinforced to 13 ships of the line , whose pursuit was hampered by a lack of scouting frigates and reliable information . Bonaparte 's first target was the island of Malta , which was under the government of the Knights of St. John and theoretically granted its owner control of the Central Mediterranean . Bonaparte 's forces landed on the island and rapidly overwhelmed the defenders , securing the port city of Valletta before continuing to Egypt . When Nelson learned of the French capture of the island , he guessed the French target to be Egypt and sailed for Alexandria , but passed the French during the night of 22 June without discovering them and arrived off Egypt first . 
 Unable to find Bonaparte , Nelson turned back across the Mediterranean , eventually reaching Sicily on 19 July . While Nelson was returning westwards , Bonaparte reached Alexandria and stormed the city , capturing the coast and marching his army inland . His fleet , entrusted to Vice @-@ Admiral François @-@ Paul Brueys D 'Aigalliers , was anchored in a line of battle in Aboukir Bay . On 1 August , Nelson , who had returned to the Egyptian coast after reports gathered at Coron revealed the French invasion , arrived off Aboukir Bay . Although it was late afternoon and the British fleet had no accurate charts of the bay , Nelson ordered an immediate attack on the French van . Brueys was unprepared , and his ships were unable to manoeuvre as the British split into two divisions and sailed down either side of the French line , capturing all five ships of the vanguard and engaging his 120 @-@ gun flagship Orient in the centre . At 21 : 00 , Orient caught fire and exploded , killing most of the crew and ending the main combat . Sporadic fighting continued for the next two days , until all of the French ships had been captured , destroyed or fled . At the Battle of the Nile , eleven French ships of the line and two frigates were eliminated , trapping Bonaparte in Egypt and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean . 
 With the French Navy in the Mediterranean defeated , other nations were encouraged to join the Second Coalition and go to war with France . Portugal , the Kingdom of Naples , the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire all subsequently deployed forces to the Mediterranean . The Russians and Turks participated in the blockade of Egypt and operations in the Adriatic Sea while the Portuguese joined the Siege of Malta , which was distantly conducted by Nelson from his lodgings in Naples . Nelson , who had been wounded at the Battle of the Nile , became involved in Neapolitan politics and encouraged King Ferdinand to go to war with France , resulting in the loss of his mainland kingdom . In the Western Mediterranean , Vice @-@ Admiral Earl St Vincent , who commanded the Mediterranean fleet from off Cadiz , deployed forces against Minorca , rapidly captured the island and turned it into an important naval base . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Bonaparte 's plan = = = 
 At the beginning of 1798 , the War of the First Coalition had come to an end with French control of Northern Italy , much of the Low Countries and the Rhineland confirmed by the Treaty of Campo Formio . Of all the major European powers that had at one time allied against the French Republic , only the Kingdom of Great Britain remained hostile , and the French Directory determined to end the French Revolutionary Wars by eliminating Britain . A series of invasions of the British Isles were planned , and the 28 @-@ year @-@ old General Napoleon Bonaparte , who had defeated the Austrians in Italy the previous year , was assigned to lead the Armée d 'Angleterre ( Army of England ) that had been assembled at Boulogne . However , the English Channel was firmly controlled by the Royal Navy and French invasion supplies , particularly of viable landing craft , were totally inadequate for the purpose . 
 In the early spring of 1798 , Bonaparte left his command at Boulogne and returned to Paris , reporting that continued British naval supremacy in Northern European waters made an invasion impossible in the near future . With operations to the north impossible , Bonaparte directed his attention southwards to Toulon , the principal French seaport on the Mediterranean . There a French army and fleet had begun assembling for a secret location , speculated by French commentators to be aimed at a wide variety of places , including among others Britain , Sicily , Malta and the Crimea . The expedition 's intended target was actually Egypt , which formed an important link in the chain of communications between Britain and the economically vital colony of British India . Bonaparte considered the capture of Egypt as the most important step in neutralising the massive economic benefits that Britain gained from trade with India and bringing Britain to terms : in August 1797 he wrote " The time is not far away that we will feel that , in order to truly destroy England , we must take Egypt . " Possession of Egypt could grant the French control of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea , forcing severe delays to dispatches sent between Britain and India and obstructing trade worth £ 2 @.@ 7 million ( the equivalent of £ 260 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) to the British economy . In addition , a successful invasion of Egypt could be followed by a direct attack on British territory in India , possibly in conjunction with the <unk> Tippoo Sultan of Seringapatam . The French Mediterranean Fleet was unopposed at the start of 1798 – following the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1796 , in which Spain formed an alliance with France and declared war on Britain , the Royal Navy had withdrawn from the Mediterranean bases of Corsica and Elba . By early 1798 , their Mediterranean Fleet was based at the Tagus River in Portugal , their one remaining continental ally . With no permanent British fleet in the Mediterranean and an uprising imminent in Ireland , Bonaparte firmly believed that the Royal Navy would be unable to intervene in his plans , even if they should discover them . 
 With passage to Egypt seemingly unopposed Bonaparte gave orders for a fleet of thirteen ships of the line , led by the 120 @-@ gun Orient under Vice @-@ Admiral François @-@ Paul Brueys D 'Aigalliers and numerous smaller warships , including the entire Venetian Navy , captured the previous year , to prepare for sea . The fleet was to be accompanied by up to 400 transport ships , which were to carry the 35 @,@ 000 men detailed for the invasion . On 3 May , Bonaparte departed Paris , arriving at Toulon five days later to oversee the final preparations . On 9 May he reviewed the assembled army and gave a speech announcing that the expedition was bound for an unspecified foreign land . The speech was met with an enthusiastic response from his soldiers and a revised version subsequently appeared in Le Moniteur Universel and was widely distributed throughout France as a poster . Despite Bonaparte 's pronouncement the French departure was delayed : a strong headwind prevented the fleet from sailing for another nine days , conditions finally lifting on 18 May that permitted the 22 warships and 120 transports that made up the French fleet to sail the following day . 
 = = = St. Vincent 's response = = = 
 Britain was not unaware of French preparations at Toulon and along the Mediterranean coast , but despite sustained efforts by British agents in France the destination of the French fleet was unknown . Egypt was not seriously considered by the British government : when Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas suggested it , he was urged by Foreign Secretary Lord Grenville to think " with a map in your hand , and with a calculation of distances . " Letters reached London and St. Vincent at the Tagus describing extensive preparations right along the French and Italian Mediterranean coastlines , but the distances between the base in the Tagus and Toulon prevented any sustained observation of French movements . Urgent orders were sent from Lord Spencer at the Admiralty to Vice @-@ Admiral Earl St. Vincent , commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet at the Tagus , to despatch a squadron to investigate under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson . Nelson had returned to the fleet three days earlier at Lord Spencer 's order , following recovery in Britain from the loss of an arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in July 1797 . 
 St. Vincent had already been preparing for an expedition to Toulon with Nelson in mind , and the rear @-@ admiral departed the Tagus in his flagship HMS Vanguard on 2 May . St Vincent was overjoyed to be able to place Nelson in command of the mission , writing that " the arrival of Admiral Nelson has given me new life ... his presence in the Mediterranean is so very essential " . However , his preference for Nelson over the more senior admirals Sir William Parker and Sir John Orde provoked a storm of protest , which eventually culminated in Orde challenging St Vincent to a duel , and being subsequently ordered to return to Britain . On 9 May Nelson collected the ships of the line HMS Alexander and HMS Orion under Captains Alexander Ball and Sir James Saumarez the frigates HMS Emerald and HMS Terpsichore under Captains Thomas <unk> Waller and William Hall Gage and the sloop HMS Bonne Citoyenne under Captain Robert <unk> at Gibraltar , and passed into the Mediterranean . Despite leaving under cover of darkness , Nelson 's departure was observed by Spanish forces at Cadiz , and the fort at Cape Carnero fired several shot , striking Alexander but inflicting negligible damage . 
 On 17 May Terpsichore captured the privateer La Pierre off Cape <unk> , and from the crew Nelson learned that Bonaparte 's departure was imminent , although the destination was still unknown . On 21 May , as his squadron reached the Îles d <unk> near Toulon , they were struck by strong winds that snapped Vanguard 's topmasts and brought the wreckage down onto the deck , killing two men . Vanguard was left struggling in heavy seas , blown 75 nautical miles ( 139 km ) southwards in one night . So severe was the damage that Vanguard was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast on the following day and Nelson even ordered Captain Ball , who had managed to attach a towline to the flagship , to abandon him . Ball refused the order and the British ships of the line rode out the storm together . Although Alexander was able to tow Vanguard to San Pietro Island off Sardinia for repairs , the gale had forced the squadron 's frigates to separate from the larger ships . 
 Thomas Waller on Emerald was divided from the other frigates , and his lookouts had observed Vanguard in its dismasted state at the height of the storm . The other two frigates had reefed their sails and ridden out the storm together , Captain Gage turning towards the Spanish coast when the storm abated and on 29 May encountered HMS Alcmene under Captain George Johnstone Hope , which had been sent by St. Vincent to augment Nelson 's force . Two days later Hope 's squadron encountered Emerald , which had captured two merchant ships , and together they sailed for the prearranged rendezvous point 60 miles ( 97 km ) off Cape St. Sebastian near Barcelona . Hope ordered Terpsichore and Bonne Citoyenne to cruise off Sardinia and on 3 June encountered the brig HMS Mutine under Captain Thomas Hardy , the scout of a fleet sent by Earl St. Vincent that was approaching the rendezvous . Knowing of the damaged suffered by Vanguard and aware that the French had left Toulon , Hope then took the unilateral decision to search for the French himself , dispersing the frigates across the Western Mediterranean . Hope 's ships failed to find either the British or French fleets and none of the frigates returned to Nelson 's command until after the Battle of the Nile . 
 = = Malta = = 
 Departing Toulon on 19 May , Bonaparte 's fleet passed along the coast of Provence to Genoa , where 72 additional transport ships were collected . Sailing south , the fleet reached Corsica on 23 May and collected a fleet of 22 transports from Ajaccio on 28 May . The convoy remained within sight of the eastern coastline until 30 May , crossing the Strait of Bonifacio and following the coastline of Sardinia in anticipation of combining with fleets of transports sailing from Civitavecchia . On 3 June , a message reached Bonaparte reporting the presence of Nelson 's squadron at San Pietro and the French general sent a French squadron to investigate , although by that time Nelson had sailed and the harbour was empty . Abandoning the wait for the Civitavecchia force , which had still not arrived , Bonaparte gave orders for his fleet to turn southeast , passing Mazara on Sicily and the island of Pantelleria on 7 June . There a report from a captured British merchant brig warned Bonaparte that Nelson was only a short distance behind his force with a powerful Royal Navy fleet and , concerned for his transports , Bonaparte gave urgent orders for the French fleet to steer for Malta , arriving off Valletta at 05 : 30 on 9 June , shortly after uniting with the 56 ships of the Civitavecchia convoy , which had missed the rendezvous and continued to Malta alone . 
 The report on Nelson 's activity submitted to Bonaparte on 7 June was inaccurate : Repairs to Vanguard in San Pietro took six days , the squadron sailing on 27 May for Toulon , arriving off the harbour on 31 May . Nelson had already learned of the departure of the French fleet from a captured Marseilles merchant ship , but without reinforcements or knowledge of the French direction he could not begin a pursuit . On 5 June , the brig HMS Mutine arrived off Toulon and reported that a British fleet was only a few days away , consisting of ten ships of the line and a fourth rate sent by Earl St Vincent from the Tagus on 24 May under Captain Thomas Troubridge in HMS Culloden . St Vincent , acting under urgent orders from London to send a fleet to the Mediterranean had opted to split his forces , rather than risk taking all of his ships into the Mediterranean and leaving the Spanish at Cadiz unattended . Troubridge was considered by St Vincent to be the best officer in the fleet , and Nelson , who also held a high opinion of Troubridge , immediately sailed his squadron to the scheduled rendezvous point . On 6 June , his squadron briefly intercepted a Spanish merchant convoy and capturing two ships before the admiral called off the pursuit to ensure he arrived at the agreed time . On 7 June at 12 : 00 the fleets combined , Nelson now commanding 13 74 @-@ gun ships of the line , one 50 @-@ gun ship and one brig . Noticeable by their absence were frigates , vital for scouting operations in a campaign of this nature ; After his encounter with Hope , Hardy reported to Nelson that the frigates were cruising independently , to which the admiral bitterly responded " I had thought that Hope would have known me better " . 
 = = = Nelson 's search = = = 
 Delayed until 10 June by a calm and still unaware of French intentions , Nelson initially sailed along the Corsican coast , before anchoring at Elba on 12 June and sending Mutine into Civitavecchia for information . Hardy was unable to discover the French destination and , after a detour to Elba with his whole fleet , Nelson continued south . Two days later , the admiral spoke with a Tunisian ship at <unk> , which passed on the inaccurate information that the French had been seen off Trapani , and might be anchored at Syracuse . On 17 June Nelson anchored at the Pontine Islands off Naples and sent Troubridge ashore to appeal to the British ambassador Sir William Hamilton for information and for the assistance of the Neapolitan Navy in scouting for the French . Although the Neapolitan Prime Minister Sir John Acton had already passed on reports that the French were sailing for Egypt , Hamilton did not give the report to Nelson , possibly suspicious of disinformation . Hamilton did however relay the information that Bonaparte 's fleet had passed Sardinia and were probably sailing in the direction of Malta . Despite private animosity towards France , the Neapolitan government refused to openly join the British in the war and denied Nelson the use of their frigates , although they did quietly agree to resupply Nelson 's fleet . With a rough direction established and believing the ultimate French destination to be Sicily , Nelson sailed in pursuit , but light winds hampered his advances and he did not pass the Straits of Messina until 20 June . There he received a report from the ambassador at Messina that the French were at Malta . Then on 22 June near Cape Passaro , Hardy stopped a Genoese ship from Ragusa that reported seeing the French fleet sailing southwards away from Malta , and that they had left Valletta on 16 June . This information was wrong ( or mistranslated ) in one important respect : although preparations had begun on 16 June the French had actually not departed until 19 June , and Nelson 's fleet was just 60 nautical miles ( 110 km ) miles away from Brueys . Nelson decided that the French target must be Egypt or Constantinople and called his senior captains : Saumarez , Ball , Troubridge and Henry Darby on board Vanguard for a conference . Together these officers determined Egypt as the most likely option , deducing that it was the best location in the Mediterranean from which Bonaparte could threaten India . Consequently Nelson turned southeast towards Alexandria , exercising his men 's gunnery daily to ensure they were ready for the battle he planned . His plan should his force encounter the French was clear : dividing into three squadrons , his fleet would strike the French at three points . Two squadrons of five ships each would engage the French fleet directly while the third would separate and attack the transports , sinking or capturing as many as possible . Nelson also deliberately forged close links with his captains at regular dinners aboard his flagship to ensure ease of communication and build confidence between them . He later said of this time that " I had the happiness to command a Band of Brothers . " 
 = = = Bonaparte at Malta = = = 
 While Nelson was gathering his fleet and searching for the French , Bonaparte had secured the first stage of his plan for the invasion of Egypt . Arriving off Malta on 9 June , he demanded that the island 's ruler , Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim , the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller ( or Knights of St. John of Jerusalem ) to allow his fleet to enter the harbour and purchase provisions . Hompesch refused , insisting that only two ships at a time could enter the port . Bonaparte responded by opening fire on the harbour defences and on 11 June landed soldiers at seven sites around Malta under General Louis Baraguey d 'Hilliers . Coming under fire from the 2 @,@ 000 native Maltese soldiers that mustered against the invasion , skirmishing continued in the western part of the island for 24 hours , until General Claude @-@ Henri Belgrand de Vaubois entered Mdina and the defenders withdrew to the fortress of Valletta . The Maltese troops refused to continue the fight without support from their government , and negotiations followed in which Hompesch and the knights agreed to abandon Malta on condition of financial compensation amounting to 3 million Francs . In exchange , Bonaparte gained the entire Maltese archipelago , including fortresses , military stores and cannon , the small Maltese Navy and Army and the entire property of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta . 
 The Maltese position had already been severely weakened by the large number of Frenchmen who were part of the Order , who refused en masse to take up arms against Bonaparte . The French Revolution had already significantly reduced the Knights ' income and their ability to put up serious resistance to Bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources . On 12 June , Bonaparte finally announced to his troops the destination of the expedition and on 19 June he sailed for Alexandria , initially steering east towards Crete . He left behind Vaubois and 4 @,@ 000 men to maintain Malta as a base to control the Central Mediterranean . To ensure that news of the impending attack on Egypt did not spread ahead of the fleet , Brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted the convoy during the passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached Alexandria . On 26 June , the British gained the first firm intelligence of French intentions , when the frigate HMS Seahorse under Captain Edward Foote encountered and captured the French frigate Sensible , which was returning to Toulon from Malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers , including General d 'Hilliers . From these prisoners the destination of the French fleet was discovered and Seahorse , joined shortly afterwards by Terpsichore , sailed in pursuit , hoping to encounter Nelson . 
 = = Arrivals at Alexandria = = 
 Nelson 's passage from Sicily to Alexandria was uneventful , the journey taking six days . Due to his lack of frigates , Nelson was unable to scout to the flanks of his advance and as a result only spoke with three merchant ships , none of which had useful information about the French fleet . The lack of frigates had already had a decisive effect on 22 June , when the British fleet sighted four sails to the southeast . Although Captain Thomas Thompson of HMS Leander requested permission to investigate the strangers , Nelson refused and ordered his fleet to continue on their current heading , believing the French to be five days ahead and wishing to reach Alexandria as rapidly as possible . Had British frigates been available to approach and investigate the distant squadron , they might have discovered that they were scouts for the main French fleet , which was only a short distance away . The French frigate had sighted the British fleet and reported its presence to Bonaparte , who adjusted his convoy 's direction slightly to a more northerly trajectory . As a result , Nelson 's fleet passed north of the French to the east of Malta during the night in a heavy mist . Although Nelson was so close that his signal guns could be heard aboard Orient , his lookouts did not observe the French ships and the British fleet continued ahead without deviating . When dawn broke the following day , Bonaparte 's diversion to the northeast had taken his convoy out of sight of the British fleet , which continued to the southeast undisturbed . On 28 June , Mutine arrived at Alexandria ahead of Nelson 's fleet , and discovered that the French fleet was not in the harbour . Once the main fleet had arrived , attempts were made to contact the British Consul George Baldwin , but these failed as he had been dismissed by the British government shortly before and had left the city . As a result , official diplomatic channels were closed to Nelson . A message warning of the French approach was carried to the Ottoman governor Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim by Hardy in Mutine . Kurayyim replied that he had not seen the French fleet , and that he would enforce the Ottoman Empire 's neutrality and forbid both the British and the French from entering the harbour or landing on the coast . He was dismissive of the British warnings : " It is impossible that the French should come to our country . They have no business here and we are not at war with them . " Without Baldwin no further entries could be made , and when there was still no sign of the French on the morning of 29 June , Nelson decided to turn back northeast and take another pass across the central Mediterranean towards Corfu , following a more northerly course than his first voyage . 
 = = = Invasion of Egypt = = = 
 Bonaparte 's fleet , delayed by its many transport ships , passed Cape Durazzo on the island of Crete during the 30 June and reached Alexandria the following morning , driven by the fresh <unk> winds . Bonaparte 's first action was to send a small brig into the harbour to collect the French consul , Charles Magallon , who relayed the news of Nelson 's stay off the port and of Kurayyim 's refusal to allow the French to land . Seriously concerned that Nelson might return while his men were still in their transports , Bonaparte gave orders for the landing to go ahead immediately . Soldiers were landed in the region of the <unk> Creek , although the appearance of a sail to the east was mistaken for a scout from the British fleet and caused momentary panic , Bonaparte reportedly exclaiming : " Fortune , m <unk> @-@ tu ? <unk> ! <unk> cinq jours ! " ( Fortune , wilt thou abandon me ? What ! Only five days ! ) . The newcomer was eventually revealed to be the French frigate Justice sent from Malta , and the invasion continued unopposed . By evening the landing had been completed , although several boats had been wrecked in the surf and Bonaparte himself estimated that at least 20 men had drowned . 
 On 2 July , Bonaparte led his men to victory in the brief Battle of Alexandria and secured the city . He placed General Jean Baptiste Kléber in command with Rear @-@ Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley in charge of the harbour . Finding that entrances to the anchorage were too shallow to accommodate the main body of the French fleet , Bonaparte ordered Brueys to sail his squadron to the wider Aboukir Bay , 20 miles ( 32 km ) northeast of Alexandria . Brueys was instructed that if he considered the anchorage to be unsafe then he was to sail for Corfu , leaving only a small light force that could anchor comfortably in Alexandria . There Brueys held a conference with his officers to decide on their response should Nelson discover them in the bay . Although Rear @-@ Admiral Armand Blanquet of Franklin argued that the fleet was safest sailing out to meet the British , he was outvoted and overruled , Brueys ordering that the ships remain anchored in line of battle to receive the British attack . On 21 July , the frigates Seahorse and Terpsichore arrived at Alexandria and observed the French dispositions while flying French colours to confuse observers from the shore . With no sign of Nelson , Foote and Hall turned back westwards in search of the admiral . When Brueys learned that British frigates had been seen off the Egyptian coast , he decided that the retreat of these vessels signified that there was no danger of imminent attack by a British force and therefore failed to take precautions against attack . 
 = = = Nelson returns = = = 
 Nelson , having sailed northeast on the same day that the first French ships arrived off Alexandria , had reached Anatolia on 4 July and turned westward against the wind , sailing for Sicily again . His ships were briefly scattered by a storm on 5 July , before reconstituting the following day and on 18 July the British fleet reached Cape Passaro again and on 19 July Nelson 's force anchored in Syracuse to take on fresh provisions supplied in part by Emma , Lady Hamilton , the wife of the ambassador to Naples . Frustrated , Nelson wrote in a letter to his wife Fanny ; " Every moment I have to regret the frigates having left me , to which must be attributed my ignorance of the movements of the enemy . " Reports subsequently reached the British fleet at Syracuse that the French had not been seen in the Eastern Mediterranean , in the Adriatic or in the Aegean Sea , leaving either Egypt or Syria as the only likely destinations . Sailing once more on 25 July , Nelson turned his ships east once again sailing for Morea and sending Troubridge in Culloden into Coron on 28 July for news . The Ottoman governor reported that the French had been seen sailing southwards from Crete at the start of the month and presented Troubridge with a French merchant ship that was anchored in the harbour . With their first definite sighting of the French , the British fleet turned southwards towards Alexandria . 
 = = Battle of the Nile = = 
 On 1 August , Nelson 's fleet reached the Egyptian coast , the ships HMS Swiftsure and HMS Alexander detached as scouts to investigate Alexandria harbour . Although the transport fleet was observed in the harbour , the French battle fleet was not . Despite initial disappointment , Nelson ordered his ships to search the coastline , and at 14 : 00 lookouts on HMS Zealous reported the French anchored in line of battle in Aboukir Bay . Brueys believed that his line , protected by shoals to the north and west , was impenetrable and that as a result the British would be forced to attack the rear and centre of his fleet . He consequently placed his strongest ships at these points , planning to stall the British fleet while his van used the prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack . Brueys was also confident that the British fleet , strung out and with nightfall approaching , would not attack that day . He believed that Nelson would anchor off the bay and attack in the morning , giving Brueys time to prepare and leaving open the option of simply sailing away during the night , following Bonaparte 's orders to avoid a direct confrontation with the British fleet . 
 = = = Nelson 's attack = = = 
 Despite Brueys hopes , Nelson was determined to press home his attack at once and ordered his ships to advance , only pausing to fit springs on their anchor cables , which would allow them to easily direct their broadsides in cramped , shallow coastal waters . Without an accurate chart of the bay , Nelson was forced to be cautious in his advance , and ordered Captain Samuel Hood in Zealous to take soundings as he advanced to establish the depth of the bay . At 18 : 20 , as the British ships HMS Goliath and Zealous rounded the northern shoal , the leading French ships Guerrier and Conquérant opened fire . As he approached the French line , Captain Thomas Foley in Goliath noticed that Brueys had made a serious error in the distribution of his forces . Rather than place his lead ship Guerrier close to the northern shoal , the French admiral had left a gap , widened by the order for the French fleet to only anchor by the bow which meant that they drifted significantly , between Guerrier and the shoals . Sailing directly through this gap , Foley raked Guerrier and engaged the second ship of the French line , Conquérant . Zealous also passed through the gap and attacked Guerrier , and was followed by HMS Orion , HMS Theseus and HMS Audacious , all of which opened up a fierce fire on the first four French ships against their unprepared port sides . 
 Nelson followed in Vanguard , bringing the next two ships into action with the starboard side of the French van , catching the French ships in a crossfire that rapidly battered and dismasted the ships , despite determined defence . As the French van was destroyed , HMS Bellerophon and HMS Majestic attacked the French centre . Outnumbered and faced with the massed broadsides of Orient and the 80 @-@ gun Franklin and Tonnant , both British ships suffered massive damage . Culloden , bringing up the rear of the British line , passed too close to the northern shoal and grounded , Troubridge suffering severe damage to his hull despite efforts by Mutine and Leander to drag the ship off . By 19 : 00 darkness had fallen , and within an hour the French van had been defeated , Guerrier , Conquérant , Spartiate , Aquilon and Peuple Souverain all either in British hands or too badly damaged to continue fighting . The British too had suffered damage , with Vanguard and Goliath badly hit while to the south both Bellerophon and Majestic had been forced to cut their anchor cables and pull away from their respective opponents . Bellerophon had been dismasted , Majestic 's captain George <unk> Westcott had been killed , and on Vanguard Nelson had suffered a severe head wound . 
 = = = Destruction of Orient = = = 
 Shortly after 20 : 00 , the trailing Swiftsure and Alexander , joined by Leander , attacked the French centre , causing severe damage to Franklin and killing Admiral Brueys on his quarterdeck with a cannon shot . At 21 : 00 , a fire broke out in Orient 's stern , the blaze spread further by volleys from Swiftsure that also defeated efforts to extinguish it . The flames spread rapidly , racing up the masts and across the decks until the entire flagship was a blazing wreck . At 22 : 00 , the vast magazines detonated , tearing the ship apart and hurling burning wreckage onto the neighbouring vessels . For ten minutes not a shot was fired , as the nearest ships battled to extinguish fires and the further ones paused in shock . The first ship to recommence hostilities was Franklin , but Admiral Blanquet 's heavily outnumbered flagship was forced to surrender by 24 : 00 . Tonnant , the only French ship still engaged , fought on against Majestic until 03 : 00 , when the mortally wounded Captain Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars succeeded in dragging his ship to the temporary safety of the rear division under Rear @-@ Admiral Pierre @-@ Charles Villeneuve . 
 At 04 : 00 on 2 August , firing began again between Villeneuve 's ships and a scratch British squadron formed from the less damaged ships . By 11 : 00 , Villeneuve had conducted a successful fighting withdrawal to the mouth of the bay , and was able to escape to open water . However , Villeneuve had been forced to abandon the battered Tonnant and the grounded Timoléon , retaining just two ships of the line and two frigates . While Villeneuve escaped , British ships received the surrender of Heureux and Mercure , which had grounded shortly after the explosion of Orient , and forced the captain of the frigate Artémise to scuttle his vessel . On 3 August , Theseus and Leander were sent to complete the destruction of the French fleet ; Tonnant surrendered and Timoléon was set on fire by its crew and destroyed . 
 = = Subsequent operations = = 
 With the exception of Villeneuve 's fugitives , the French Mediterranean Fleet had been annihilated . Nine of eleven ships of the line had been captured or destroyed , as well as two frigates . French casualties totalled more than 3 @,@ 000 and possibly as many as 5 @,@ 000 , compared to British losses of 218 killed and 677 wounded . However , many of Nelson 's ships were seriously damaged , and urgent repairs were required for both his own ships and the captured prizes before they could begin the long voyage back to Britain . For more than two weeks Nelson remained in Aboukir Bay , effecting repairs , writing despatches and assessing the strategic situation in Egypt . The first ship detached from his squadron was Leander , sent on 5 August to the fleet under Earl St. Vincent off Cadiz with reports of the battle . On 8 August Aboukir Island was stormed and captured , and on 12 August Emerald , Alcmene and Bonne Citoyenne finally caught up with the fleet , followed on 17 August by Seahorse and Terpsichore . Mutine was detached on 13 August with despatches for the Admiralty and on 14 August Nelson sent seven ships with the six seaworthy prizes to the mouth of Aboukir Bay under the command of Saumarez . This convoy sailed for Gibraltar on 15 August and the following day Nelson burnt Heureux , followed on 18 August by Mercure and Guerrier , none of which were fit for continued service . On 19 August Nelson separated his remaining ships , leading three vessels northwards towards Naples and leaving a blockade squadron off Alexandria of Zealous , Goliath , Swiftsure and the frigates , under Captain Samuel Hood . 
 By the time Nelson departed Alexandria , his first set of dispatches were already in French hands . Leander had been discovered off the western coast of Crete on 18 August 1798 by the French ship of the line Généreux , one of Villeneuve 's escapees . After separating from Villeneuve 's squadron on 17 August , Généreux was sailing to Corfu when it encountered the British fourth rate . The larger French ship soon overtook the British vessel and a heated exchange followed : French efforts to board Leander were driven back with heavy casualties , and Captain Thompson at one stage successfully raked his opponent , but gradually the heavier weight of Généreux inflicted severe damage to the British ship and after six and a half hours Thompson was forced to surrender . French captain Lejoille then authorised widespread looting of the personal effects of the British crew , whom he also forced to conduct repairs on both ships , an act against the established conventions of naval warfare . The prize was towed to Corfu for repairs , the two battered vessels briefly encountering Mutine , which escaped to the westwards before Généreux could give chase . In captivity Lejoille continued to refuse to allow the British officers medical attention or return their stolen property . Eventually returned to Britain , Thompson and Berry were knighted and heavily praised for their defence of their ship against heavy odds , while Lejoille was also commended for his success , assisted by his incorrect account of the battle published in French newspapers . 
 = = = Alexandria = = = 
 With the French naval presence in the Mediterranean reduced to a few scattered vessels , the allies of the Second Coalition were able to exert their dominance in the region . Off Alexandria , the squadron under Captain Hood successfully prevented communications between France and the French army in Egypt . On 22 August , just three days after Nelson sailed north , Alcmene intercepted the 6 @-@ gun dispatch vessel Légère off Alexandria harbour and forced the captain to surrender . As his flag was struck , the captain hurled the dispatches into the sea . This action was witnessed by sailors John Taylor and John Harding aboard Alcmene and both men dived into the water , successfully retrieving the messages . For their bravery in diving from a rapidly moving ship into unknown waters , both men were granted annual pensions of £ 20 ( the equivalent of £ 1 @,@ 900 as of 2016 ) . Three days after the capture of Légère , Captain Foley of Goliath sent a boat into the sheltered anchorage under Aboukir Castle , where his men boarded and captured the armed ketch <unk> , typical of the gun @-@ vessels that had fired on the British advance during the Battle of the Nile . On 2 September , another dispatch vessel reached the Egyptian coast , the 4 @-@ gun cutter <unk> carrying General Camin and 60 men from Malta . Swiftsure and Emerald managed to cut off the vessel from Alexandria harbour and drive it ashore near the town of <unk> . Although the cutter swiftly broke up in the surf , most of the men aboard managed to scramble ashore . There , while the British ships lay off shore unable to intervene , Bedouin partisans discovered the survivors and massacred them , dragging the few survivors inland before French cavalry could rescue them . The only survivors were rescued by Lieutenant Francis William Fane , who swam to shore with an empty barrel attached to a rope . Despite coming under fire from the French on the beach , he was able to save five men from the Bedouin attack . 
 In October the small British squadron at Alexandria was briefly reinforced by a Portuguese squadron of four ships of the line and the 64 @-@ gun HMS Lion under Captain Manley Dixon , although the Portuguese sailed for Malta after only a few days . On 19 October the squadron was joined by two Turkish corvettes , two Russian frigates and 16 small Turkish gunboats , arranged by Hood on a visit to Rhodes in Swiftsure the week before . The gunboats were subsequently used to bombard Aboukir Castle and a French encampment at Lake <unk> on 25 October , although results were negligible . After the first day the Turkish crews were replaced with British sailors , but except for a complaint from the French that " unfair " incendiary weapons were used in the attack , nothing was achieved . The incendiary shells subsequently proved to have been taken from the captured Spartiate following the battle on 1 August and were found to be made of a substance that burned even under water . After three days the bombardment was abandoned and no further activity took place on the Egyptian coast during the remainder of the year . The Turkish and Russian vessels were eventually withdrawn in December , while Lion was detached to join the blockade of Malta . 
 = = = Ionian Sea = = = 
 The main Mediterranean fleets of the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire were deployed in the Ionian Sea . At the Treaty of Campo Formio , France had been awarded the Ionian Islands and the four fortresses of <unk> , Parga , Preveza and <unk> on the Albanian and Greek coasts . In early October 1798 , following the declaration of war between France and the Ottomans , a large Turkish army had advanced across the Balkans and rapidly forced the fortresses to surrender . At the same time , the Ionian Islands were attacked by a joint Russian and Turkish expeditionary force , which included ten Russian ships of the line , numerous smaller Russian vessels and approximately 30 assorted Turkish ships . On board were 8 @,@ 000 Turkish soldiers , which rapidly invaded and seized the islands of <unk> , Santa Maura , <unk> , Cephalonia , Zante and Cerigo , capturing 1 @,@ 500 French prisoners by 10 October . Only the large fortified island of Corfu held out , and there the defenders were forced back into the main town . Although the town was besieged , operations were slow and the blockade was only loosely enforced , allowing Généreux to successfully breakout and reach Ancona . By the end of the year little had changed , the French garrison remaining besieged in Corfu . 
 = = = Malta and Naples = = = 
 Further westwards , the newly captured French island of Malta was under a much more diligent blockade . The returning convoy from Aboukir Bay under Saumarez reached Malta in September . There he encountered a squadron of four Portuguese ships of the line and the British ship Lion under the command of Tomás Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama , Marquess de Niza , initially sending them on to Alexandria . While anchored off Malta awaiting favourable winds , a delegation of native Maltese citizens was brought on board Saumarez 's ship Orion on 25 September . They announced that the Maltese people , infuriated with French disestablishment of the Roman Catholic Church on Malta , had risen up against the French garrison and were forcing them back towards the fortress of Valletta . Saumarez attempted to negotiate the surrender of the island with Vaubois , but was rebuffed . Unable to delay his passage to Gibraltar any longer , Saumarez gave the Maltese 1 @,@ 200 muskets and promised to send assistance as soon as he was able . By 12 October , the French were besieged in Valletta by 10 @,@ 000 Maltese irregulars . Vaubois had only 3 @,@ 000 healthy troops , although the arrival of Villeneuve with the ship of the line Guillaume Tell and two frigates did bolster his defences . 
 On the same day that the French retreated to Valletta , Nelson despatched the ships Alexander , Culloden , and Colossus from his squadron at Naples to blockade the port , under the command of Captain Alexander Ball . Although the Neapolitans refused to deploy forces to Malta , which was technically their territory , the squadron was joined within a few days by Niza 's Portuguese ships and then by Nelson , now Lord Nelson , in Vanguard on 24 October . Four days later , Nelson authorised Ball to negotiate the surrender of the nearby island of Gozo . The French abandoned the island 's fortifications and the British captured 24 cannon and 3 @,@ 200 urgently required sacks of grain , which were distributed among the Maltese populace . With the French garrison trapped in Valletta , no further actions took place off Malta during the year , both sides settling in for a long siege . 
 While his captains enforced the blockade of Malta and Alexandria during September and October , Nelson was anchored in the Bay of Naples , enjoying the hospitality of King Ferdinand and Queen Maria Carolina of the Kingdom of Naples . Arriving on 22 September , Vanguard was greeted with over 500 small vessels organised by the royal family and led by a barge carrying Sir William and Lady Emma Hamilton . Over the next weeks , Nelson was taken into the court as an honoured guest , and has subsequently been accused of neglecting his naval responsibilities . It was at this time that his mutual attraction to Lady Emma Hamilton developed into a romantic affair . He also began to dabble in Neapolitan politics , successfully combining with Maria Carolina , the <unk> Queen , to encourage Ferdinand to go to war with France . Ferdinand ordered the Neapolitan army under General Mack to drive the French out of Rome . The resulting campaign was a disaster for the Neapolitans ; the French counterattacked and forced Ferdinand and his court to flee to Palermo in Sicily . The French established the Parthenopean Republic in Naples to replace the monarchy . 
 = = = Spain and Minorca = = = 
 While Nelson was engaged in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean , the main Mediterranean Fleet under Earl St Vincent had ensured that the Spanish Navy was unable to intervene . On 24 May St Vincent was joined at the Tagus by a reinforcement of eight ships under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Roger Curtis , and the admiral ordered his ships to establish blockades off the southern Spanish ports , especially Cadiz , where the main Spanish fleet lay at anchor . There regular correspondence passed between St Vincent and Admiral Don Joseph <unk> , the Spanish commander . The Spanish fleet made no major deployments during the year , except for a single convoy of the ship of the line Monarca , two frigates and several merchant vessels that sailed in April . Although privateers and minor warships fought several small engagements along the Spanish Mediterranean coast , the only significant Spanish deployment of the remainder of the year was by a frigate squadron based at Cartagena , which was intercepted by the British ship of the line Lion . At the ensuing Action of 15 July 1798 , the Spanish ships formed a line to meet the attack of Captain Dixon 's ship but the damaged frigate Santa Dorotea fell behind the leading three frigates . As the leading ships returned to <unk> after a desultory long @-@ range exchange of gunfire , Santa Dorotea was defeated and captured . 
 Once the French Mediterranean Fleet had been destroyed in Aboukir Bay , St Vincent was determined to restore British hegemony in the Mediterranean . To ensure this , his fleet needed a base with a well protected deep water harbour that could not be assaulted by land . The best island harbour in the Western Mediterranean was at Port Mahon on Minorca , where a large modern dockyard included a careening wharf , extensive storehouses and a purpose @-@ built naval hospital . These facilities were all British in manufacture , constructed during periods of occupation by British forces between 1708 – 1756 and 1763 – 1781 . St Vincent therefore detached two ships of the line , three frigates and several smaller vessels and transports to the island under Commodore John Thomas Duckworth , carrying a small army under Colonel Charles Stuart . The expeditionary force arrived off Minorca on 7 November and the troops were landed at <unk> Creek . There a Spanish attack was driven off and over the next two days the army continued inland , a detachment under Colonel Henry Paget seizing Port Mahon while the main army received the surrender of town after town , including <unk> , which overlooked the island 's principal protected anchorage . On 11 November a Spanish squadron of four frigates attempted to disrupt operations , but a swift counterattack by Duckworth 's ships drove them off . By 16 November the town of <unk> capitulated and control of the island was ceded to British forces .

It is headquartered in Shinagawa , Tokyo , Japan ; and its main hubs are Tokyo 's Narita International Airport and Tokyo International Airport ( Haneda Airport ) , as well as Osaka 's Kansai International Airport and Osaka International Airport . JAL group companies include Japan Airlines , J @-@ Air , JAL Express , Japan Air Commuter , Japan Transocean Air and Ryukyu Air Commuter for domestic feeder services ; and JAL Cargo for cargo and mail services . 
 JAL group operations include scheduled and non @-@ scheduled international and domestic passenger and cargo services to 220 destinations in 35 countries worldwide , including codeshares . The group has a fleet of 279 aircraft . In the fiscal year ended 31 March 2009 , the airline group carried over 52 million passengers and over 1 @.@ 1 million tons of cargo and mail . Japan Airlines , J @-@ Air , JAL Express , and Japan Transocean Air are members of the Oneworld airline alliance . 
 JAL was established in 1951 and became the national airline of Japan in 1953 . After over three decades of service and expansion , the airline was fully privatized in 1987 . In 2002 , the airline merged with Japan Air System , Japan 's third @-@ largest airline and became the sixth largest airline in the world by passengers carried . Japan Airlines is currently an official sponsor of Japan Football Association , Japan national football team , Shimizu S @-@ Pulse and <unk> Sapporo . All Nippon Airways , the largest airline in Japan , is JAL 's main competitor .

 Japan Air Lines Co . , Ltd. was established on 1 August 1951 , with the government of Japan recognizing the need for a reliable air transportation system to help Japan grow in the aftermath of the World War II . The airline was founded with an initial capital of ¥ 100 million ; and its headquarters located in Ginza , Chūō , Tokyo . Between 27 and 29 August , the airline operated invitational flights on a Douglas DC @-@ 3 <unk> , leased from Philippine Airlines . On 25 October , Japan 's first post @-@ war domestic airline service was inaugurated , using a Martin 2 @-@ 0 @-@ 2 aircraft , named <unk> , and crew leased from Northwest Airlines . 
 On 1 August 1953 , the Diet of Japan passed the Japan Air Lines Company Act , forming a new state @-@ owned Japan Air Lines on 1 October , which assumed all assets and liabilities of its private predecessor . By 1953 the JAL network extended northward from Tokyo to Sapporo and Misawa , and westward to Nagoya , Osaka , Iwakuni and Fukuoka . 
 On 2 February 1954 the airline began international flights , carrying 18 passengers from Tokyo to San Francisco on a Douglas DC @-@ 6B City of Tokyo via Wake Island and Honolulu . The flights between Tokyo and San Francisco are still Flights 1 and 2 , to commemorate its first international service . The early flights were advertised as being operated by American crews and serviced by United Air Lines in San Francisco . 
 The airline , in addition to the Douglas DC @-@ 3 , Douglas DC @-@ 6B and Martin 2 @-@ 0 @-@ 2s , operated Douglas DC @-@ 4 and Douglas DC @-@ 7C during the 1950s . JAL flew to Hong Kong via Okinawa by 1955 , having pared down its domestic network to Tokyo , Osaka , Fukuoka and Sapporo . By 1958 the Hong Kong route had been extended to Bangkok and Singapore . With DC @-@ <unk> JAL was able to fly nonstop between Seattle and Tokyo in 1959 . 
 = = = = Jet Era = = = = 
 In 1960 the airline took delivery of its first jet , a Douglas DC @-@ 8 named Fuji , introducing jet service on the Tokyo @-@ Honolulu @-@ San Francisco route . JAL went on to operate a fleet of 51 DC @-@ 8s , retiring the last of the type in 1987 . Fuji flew until 1974 and was then used as a maintenance training platform until 1989 ; its nose section was stored at Haneda Airport and eventually put on public display at the JAL Sky Museum in March 2014 . 
 JAL also began flying to Seattle and Hong Kong in 1960 . At the end of 1961 JAL had transpolar flights from Tokyo to Seattle , Copenhagen , London and Paris via Anchorage , Alaska and to Los Angeles and San Francisco via Honolulu , Hawaii . 
 During the 1960s JAL flew to many new cities including Moscow , New York and Pusan . DC @-@ 8 flights to Europe via Anchorage started in 1961 ; flights to Europe via India started in 1962 , initially with Convair 880s . 
 By 1965 Japan Air Lines was headquartered in the Tokyo Building in Marunouchi , Chiyoda , Tokyo . By this time over half of JAL 's revenue was generated on transpacific routes to the United States and the airline was lobbying the United States for fifth freedom rights to fly transatlantic routes from the East Coast . The transpacific route was extended east from San Francisco to New York in November 1966 and to London in 1967 ; flights between San Francisco and London ended in December 1972 . 
 Between 1967 and 1969 JAL had an agreement with Aeroflot to operate a joint service between Tokyo and Moscow using a Soviet Tupolev Tu @-@ 114 . The flight crew included one JAL member , and the cabin crew had five members each from Aeroflot and JAL . The weekly flight started in April 1967 ; in May the schedule was 10 hr 35 min Moscow to Tokyo and 11 hr 25 min to return . 
 In 1972 , under the 45 / 47 system ( 45 / <unk> , yon <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ) , the so @-@ called " aviation constitution " enacted by the Japanese government , JAL was granted flag carrier status to operate international routes . The airline was also designated to operate domestic trunk routes in competition with All Nippon Airways and Toa Domestic Airlines . 
 The signing of a Civil Air Transport Agreement between China and Japan on 20 April 1974 , caused the suspension of air routes between the Taiwan and Japan on 21 April . A new subsidiary , Japan Asia Airways , was established on 8 August 1975 , and air services between the two countries were restored on 15 September . During the 1970s the airline bought the Boeing 727 , Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 10 for its growing routes within Japan and to other countries . 
 In the 1980s the airline performed special flights for the Crown Prince Akihito and Crown Princess Michiko of Japan , Pope John Paul II and for Japanese prime ministers , until the introduction of the dedicated government aircraft using two Boeing 747 @-@ 400 , operated as Japanese Air Force One and Japanese Air Force Two . During that decade the airline introduced new Boeing 747 @-@ 100SR , Boeing 747 @-@ SUD and Boeing 767 jets to the fleet , and retired the Boeing 727s and Douglas DC @-@ 8s . 
 In 1978 JAL started flights to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro via Anchorage and San Juan ; the stopover was changed to Los Angeles in 1982 and to New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport in 1999 . Until 2009 the airline operated fifth @-@ freedom flights between New York and São Paulo and between Vancouver and Mexico City . 
 = = = <unk> era = = = 
 Japan began considering airline deregulation in the late 1970s , with the government announcing the abandoning of the 45 / 47 system in 1985 . In 1987 Japan Airlines was completely privatized , and the other two airlines in Japan , All Nippon Airways ( ANA ) and Japan Air System ( JAS ) , were permitted to compete with JAL on domestic and international routes . Increased competition resulted in changes to the airline 's corporate structure , and it was reorganized into three divisions : international passenger service , domestic passenger service , and cargo ( including mail ) service . 
 Japan Airlines began the 1990s with flights to evacuate Japanese citizens from Iraq before the start of the Gulf War . In October 1990 , Japan Air Charter was established , and , in September 1996 , an agreement with The Walt Disney Company made Japan Airlines the official airline of Tokyo Disneyland . JAL Express was established in April 1997 , with Boeing 737 aircraft . In the 1990s the airline encountered further economic difficulties stemming from recessions in the United States and United Kingdom , plus a domestic downturn . Following years of profit since 1986 the airline began to post operating losses in 1992 . Cost @-@ cutting , including the formation of the low @-@ cost JAL Express domestic subsidiary and the transfer of tourist operations to JALways ( the successor to Japan Air Charter ) , helped return the airline to profitability in 1999 . 
 In 1997 the airline flew Japanese prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to Peru to help negotiate in the Japanese embassy hostage crisis . Japan Airlines placed orders for Boeing 777s during the 1990s , allowing for fleet renewal . It was one of eight airlines participating in the Boeing 777 design process , shaping the design to their specifications . 
 = = = JAS merger = = = 
 In 2001 , Japan Air System and Japan Airlines agreed to merge ; and on 2 October 2002 , they established a new holding company called Japan Airlines System ( <unk> , Nihon Kōkū Shisutemu ) , forming a new core of the JAL Group . Aircraft liveries were changed to match the design of the new JAL Group . At that time the merged group of airlines was the sixth largest in the world by passengers carried . 
 On 1 April 2004 , JAL changed its name to Japan Airlines International and JAS changed its name to Japan Airlines Domestic . JAS flight codes were changed to JAL flight codes , JAS check @-@ in desks were refitted in JAL livery and JAS aircraft were gradually repainted . On 26 June 2004 , the parent company Japan Airlines System was renamed to Japan Airlines Corporation . 
 Following the merger , two companies operated under the JAL brand : Japan Airlines International ( <unk> , Nihon Kōkū <unk> ) and Japan Airlines Domestic ( <unk> , Nihon Kōkū Japan ) . Japan Airlines Domestic had primary responsibility for JAL 's large network of intra @-@ Japan flights , while JAL International operated both international and trunk domestic flights . On 1 October 2006 , Japan Airlines International and Japan Airlines Domestic merged into a single brand , Japan Airlines International . 
 The airline applied to join Oneworld on 25 October 2005 . Japan Airlines claimed that its Oneworld membership would be in the best interests of the airline 's plans to further develop the airline group and its strong commitment to provide the very best to its customers . Japan Airlines , together with Malév and Royal Jordanian , joined the alliance on 1 April 2007 . 
 On 1 April 2008 , JAL merged the operations of its subsidiary Japan Asia Airways ( JAA ) into JAL mainline operations . JAA had operated all JAL group flights between Japan and Taiwan between 1975 and 2008 as a separate entity due to the special political status of Taiwan . 
 = = = Restructuring = = = 
 In 2009 , Japan Airlines suffered steep financial losses , despite remaining Asia 's largest airline by revenue . As a result , the airline embarked on staff cuts and route cutbacks in an effort to reduce costs . The carrier also received a ¥ 100 billion credit line from the Japanese government that year . In September 2009 , Japan 's Ministry of Land , Infrastructure , Transport and Tourism formed a task force aimed at aiding a corporate turnaround at JAL , which examined various cost @-@ cutting and strategic partnership proposals . 
 One proposal considered was to merge JAL with ANA , which would create a single larger international airline and replace Japan Airlines International ; however , media reports suggested that this proposal would be opposed by ANA given its comparatively better financial performance as an independent carrier . The task force also examined possible partnerships with foreign carriers . 
 After weeks of speculation , JAL applied for protection under the Corporate Rehabilitation Law ( the Japanese equivalent of Administration in the United Kingdom or a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the United States ) on 19 January 2010 . JAL expects to receive a ¥ 300 billion cash injection and have debts worth ¥ 730 billion waived , in exchange for which it will cut its capital to zero , cut unprofitable routes and reduce its workforce by 15 @,@ 700 employees — a third of its 47 @,@ 000 total . JAL 's main creditors ( Mizuho Corporate Bank , Bank of Tokyo @-@ Mitsubishi <unk> and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation ) originally objected to the bankruptcy declaration , but changed their mind after the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation of Japan recommended court protection , according to a senior bank official . Shares of JAL were delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on 20 February 2010 . 
 Kazuo Inamori , founder of Kyocera and KDDI , took over as CEO of JAL . Transport minister Seiji <unk> personally visited Kyocera headquarters in late 2009 in order to persuade Inamori to accept the position ; task force leader Shinjiro Takagi believed that it was necessary to appoint a proven entrepreneur CEO in order to fix the various problems at JAL . Japan Air Commuter president Masaru Onishi was promoted to president of JAL . 
 In May , JAL began to see an increase in its passenger numbers by 1 @.@ 1 % year @-@ on @-@ year . In August , it was reported that JAL would cut 19 @,@ 133 jobs from its workforce of 47 @,@ 000 by the end of March 2015 – whilst also increasing capacity – in an attempt to make the business viable . 
 = = = Rivalry between Delta and American = = = 
 Although JAL ultimately exited bankruptcy while remaining in the Oneworld alliance , JAL was seriously considering accepting a strategic investment from Delta Air Lines and joining the SkyTeam alliance during the period between September 2009 and February 2010 . JAL also had talks with <unk> members Air France @-@ KLM and Korean Air regarding their potential involvement . 
 The Delta deal was favored by the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure , Transport and Tourism because Delta had an extensive global network and had the largest Japanese operation of any foreign airline , which it had inherited through its merger with Northwest Airlines . <unk> also supported a transaction with Air France @-@ KLM because it was a " healthier company " than American . 
 American planned to team up with Oneworld alliance members British Airways and Qantas to make a joint offer to <unk> JAL . British Airways said that it was attempting to persuade JAL to remain part of Oneworld rather than aligning itself with Delta and SkyTeam , while American CEO Gerard <unk> said that American and Oneworld remained committed to a partnership with Japan Airlines , as long as it remained a major international carrier , and reiterated his encouragement for JAL to stay with Oneworld during ceremonies to welcome Mexicana into the alliance . 
 In an interview with the Asahi Shimbun on 1 January 2010 , JAL president Haruka <unk> stated his preference in forming a partnership with Delta over American , and the Yomiuri Shimbun reported shortly thereafter that JAL and the Japanese government @-@ backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation would likely choose to form a business and capital tie @-@ up with Delta , as part of which JAL would enter SkyTeam and reduce its international flight operations in favor of code @-@ share agreements with Delta , and that American Airlines had begun procedures to end negotiations with JAL . Both JAL and American denied the report . The Wall Street Journal then reported that American Airlines raised its JAL investment offer by $ 300 million , to $ 1 @.@ 4 billion , and in separate comments to the press , Delta president Ed Bastian said that Delta was " willing and able to raise additional capital through third @-@ party resources . " 
 After JAL filed for bankruptcy , there were further media reports that JAL would leave Oneworld in favor of SkyTeam , but JAL president Masaru Onishi said on 1 February that the new JAL leadership was " seriously reviewing the issue from scratch , without being influenced by previous discussions , " and its decision on an alliance partner would be made soon . 
 On 7 February , several news outlets reported that JAL would decide to keep its alliance with American Airlines and end talks with Delta . Inamori and <unk> officials , according to the reports , decided that switching alliances from Oneworld to <unk> would be too risky and could hinder JAL 's ability to turn around quickly . Two days later , JAL officially announced that they would strengthen their partnership with American , including a joint application for antitrust immunity on transpacific routes . The airline would also fortify its relationship with other partners in the Oneworld alliance . 
 = = = Post @-@ bankruptcy developments = = = 
 JAL emerged from bankruptcy protection in March 2011 . In July , <unk> selected Nomura Holdings , <unk> Securities , Mitsubishi <unk> , Morgan Stanley , Mizuho Securities , SMBC and Nikko Securities to underwrite the sale of its equity stake in JAL , without specifying amounts or dates . On 6 January 2012 , JAL announced its intent to re @-@ list its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in an initial public offering of up to ¥ 1 trillion , which would be the largest offering in Japan in more than a year . The airline completed its IPO on the 1st section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange ( TYO : 9201 ) on 19 September 2012 . The Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation of Japan sold all its holdings ( 96 @.@ 5 % ) in JAL for 650 billion yen , greater than its 350 billion yen investment in 2010 . Even though it was oversubscribed several times , post IPO increase of the stock was close to 1 % . 
 Following its exit from bankruptcy protection , JAL began several new partnerships within the oneworld alliance . The transpacific joint venture between JAL and American commenced in April 2011 . JAL formed Jetstar Japan , a low @-@ cost carrier joint venture with Qantas subsidiary Jetstar Airways , in July . In 2012 , JAL and British Airways parent company International Airlines Group ( IAG ) submitted applications to the Japanese government and European Union respectively in seeking a joint venture business operation for flights between Japan and Europe . Finnair applied to join the JV with IAG in July 2013 , in conjunction with JAL starting new nonstop service to Helsinki .

 = = = = Logo and basic liveries = = = = 
 The JAL livery is called the tsurumaru ( <unk> ) or " crane circle . " It is an image of a Japanese red @-@ crown crane with its wings extended in full flight . The <unk> JAL logo was created in 1958 by Jerry Huff , the creative director at Botsford , Constantine and Gardner of San Francisco , which had been the advertising agency for Japan Airlines from its earliest days . JAL had used several logos up until 1958 . When the airline arranged to buy new <unk> , they decided to create a new official logo for the inauguration of their jet service worldwide . 
 In the creation of the logo , Huff was inspired by the personal crests of Samurai families . In a book he ’ d been given , We Japanese , he found pages of crests , including the crane . On his choice of the crane , he writes : " I had faith that it was the perfect symbol for Japan Air Lines . I found that the Crane myth was all positive — it mates for life ( loyalty ) , and flies high for miles without tiring ( strength . ) " 
 The tsurumaru livery was in use until 2002 , when it was replaced by a livery called the " Arc of the Sun . " The livery featured the motif of a rising sun on a creamy parchment @-@ colored background . 
 JAL is a strong supporter of UNICEF and expresses its support by having a " We Support UNICEF " logo on each aircraft . 
 Following its corporate restructuring , Japan Airlines returned to the classic tsurumaru logo starting on 1 April 2011 . <unk> , a Boeing 767 @-@ 300 , is the only remaining aircraft that has the " Arc of the Sun " livery
