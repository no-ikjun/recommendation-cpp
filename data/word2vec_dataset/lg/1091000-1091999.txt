 On January 23 , 2012 , it was reported that Twitter would be acquiring <unk> , a startup that offers malware protection for businesses . Twitter announced plans to use <unk> to help remove hateful advertisers on the website . 
 On January 26 , 2012 , Twitter began offering a feature which would allow tweets to be removed selectively by country . Twitter cited France and Germany as examples , where pro @-@ Nazi content is illegal . Deleted tweets used to be removed in all countries . The first use of the policy was to block the account of German neo @-@ Nazi group <unk> Hannover on October 18 , 2012 . The policy was used again the following day to remove anti @-@ Semitic French tweets with the hashtag # <unk> ( " a good Jew " ) . 
 On February 20 , 2012 , a third @-@ party public @-@ key encryption app ( written in Python and partially funded by a grant from the Shuttleworth Foundation ) for private messaging in Twitter , <unk> , was released . 
 On May 17 , 2012 , Twitter announced it would implement the " Do Not Track " privacy option , a cookie @-@ blocking feature found in Mozilla 's Firefox browser . The " Do Not Track " feature works only on sites that have agreed to the service . 
 In August 2012 it was reported that there is a market in fake Twitter followers that are used to increase politicians ' and celebrities ' apparent popularity . The black market for the fake followers , known as " bots " , has been linked to " nearly every politically linked account from the White House to Congress to the 2016 campaign trail " . In June 2014 , <unk> analyzed Twitter handles with the highest rates of fake followers : US President Barack Obama with 46 @.@ 8 percent , Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz with 35 @.@ 1 percent , and Senator John McCain with 23 @.@ 6 percent . The culprits working to generate the fake followers , or " bots " , include campaign workers or friends of political candidates . One site offers 1 @,@ 000 fake followers for $ 20 . The people creating the " bots " are often from Eastern Europe and Asia . In 2013 , two Italian researchers calculated 10 percent of total accounts on Twitter are " bots " however , other estimates have placed the figure even higher . 
 In April 2013 Twitter warned news organizations around the world to secure their Twitter accounts after a number of high @-@ profile hacks of official accounts , including those of the Associated Press and The Guardian . In May 2013 , Twitter announced a two @-@ factor login verification as an added measure against hacking . 
 In August 2013 , Twitter announced plans to introduce a " report abuse " button for all versions of the site . A petition for making the process of complaining about harassment easier had collected over 100 @,@ 000 signatures . The move followed the posting of abusive tweets , including rape and death threats to historian Mary Beard , British feminist campaigner Caroline Criado @-@ Perez and the British MP Stella Creasy . Three men were arrested under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in connection with the incidents . 
 In August 2014 , Twitter said that in certain cases it would delete pictures of people who had died after requests from family members and " authorized individuals " . The move followed controversy over the sharing of images on Twitter showing the killing of American journalist James Foley . 
 In December 2014 Twitter announced new reporting and blocking policies ; a blocking mechanism devised by Randi Harper , a target of GamerGate , also received notable coverage . 
 In February 2015 , in an internal Twitter memo , CEO Dick Costolo said he was ' frankly ashamed ' at how poorly Twitter handled trolling and abuse , and admitted Twitter had lost users as a result . 
 Per an updated terms of service and privacy policy , Twitter users outside of the United States are legally served by the Ireland @-@ based Twitter International Company instead of Twitter Inc . , effective May 18 , 2015 . The change make these users subject to Irish and European data protection laws .

 Twitter has a history of both using and releasing open source software while overcoming technical challenges of their service . A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open source projects which they have used , from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala . Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed <unk> , the distributed graph database <unk> , the <unk> library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients , the <unk> user interface framework for iOS , and the Bower client @-@ side package manager . The popular Twitter Bootstrap web design library was also started at Twitter and is the most popular repository on GitHub .

 t.co is a URL shortening service created by Twitter . It is only available for links posted to Twitter and not available for general use . All links posted to Twitter use a t.co wrapper . Twitter hopes that the service will be able to protect users from malicious sites , and will use it to track clicks on links within tweets . 
 Having used the services of third parties <unk> and bit.ly , Twitter began experimenting with its own URL shortening service for private messages in March 2010 using the <unk> domain , before it purchased the t.co domain . The service was tested on the main site using the accounts @ <unk> , @ <unk> and @ <unk> . On September 2 , 2010 , an email from Twitter to users said they would be expanding the roll @-@ out of the service to users . On June 7 , 2011 , Twitter announced that it was rolling out the feature .

 On June 1 , 2011 , Twitter announced its own integrated photo @-@ sharing service that enables users to upload a photo and attach it to a Tweet right from <unk> Users now also have the ability to add pictures to Twitter 's search by adding hashtags to the tweet . Twitter also plans to provide photo galleries designed to gather and syndicate all photos that a user has uploaded on Twitter and third @-@ party services such as TwitPic .

 A Twitterbot is a computer program that automatically posts on Twitter , they are programmed to tweet , retweet , and follow other accounts . According to a recent report , there were 20 million , fewer than 5 % , of accounts on Twitter that were fraudulent in 2013 . These fake accounts are often used to build large follower populations quickly for advertisers , while others respond to tweets that include a certain word or phrase . Twitter 's wide @-@ open application programming interface and cloud servers make it possible for <unk> ' existence within the social networking site .

 Twitter has been used for a variety of purposes in many industries and scenarios . For example , it has been used to organize protests , sometimes referred to as " Twitter Revolutions " , which include the 2011 Egyptian revolution , 2010 – 2011 Tunisian protests , 2009 – 2010 Iranian election protests , and 2009 Moldova civil unrest . 
 The systematic literature review by Buettner & Buettner analyzed the role of Twitter during a wide range of revolutions and other social movements ( 2007 WikiLeaks , 2009 Moldova , 2009 Austria student protest , 2009 Israel @-@ Gaza , 2009 Iran green revolution , 2009 Toronto G20 , 2010 Venezuela , 2010 Germany <unk> , 2011 Egypt , 2011 England , 2011 US Occupy movement , 2011 Spain <unk> , 2011 Greece <unk> movements , 2011 Italy , 2011 Wisconsin labor protests , 2012 Israel Hamas , 2013 Brazil Vinegar , 2013 Turkey ) . 
 The governments of Iran and Egypt blocked the service in retaliation . The Hill on February 28 , 2011 described Twitter and other social media as a " strategic weapon ... which have the apparent ability to re @-@ align the social order in real time , with little or no advanced [ sic ] warning " . During the Arab Spring in early 2011 , the number of hashtags mentioning the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt increased . A study by the Dubai School of Government found that only 0 @.@ 26 % of the Egyptian population , 0 @.@ 1 % of the Tunisian population and 0 @.@ 04 % of the Syrian population are active on Twitter . 
 The service is also used as a form of civil disobedience : in 2010 , users expressed outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by making obvious jokes about terrorism ; and in the British privacy injunction debate in the same country a year later , where several celebrities who had taken out <unk> injunctions , most notably the Manchester United player Ryan Giggs , were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored . 
 Another , more real time and practical use for Twitter exists as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news . It was neither intended nor designed for high performance communication , but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication certainly was not lost on the originators , who knew that the service could have wide @-@ reaching effects early on when the San Francisco company used it to communicate during earthquakes . The Boston Police tweeted news of the arrest of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev . Another practical use that is being studied is Twitter 's ability to track epidemics and how they spread . In addition , Twitter has acted as a sensor for automatic response to natural disasters such as bush fires . 
 Twitter has been used by Somalia 's al @-@ Shabaab rebels , who had their accounts suspended after they used the site to claim responsibility for an attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi in September 2013 . 
 The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) has also used the service : in January 2016 , Twitter was sued by the widow of a U.S. man killed in the Amman shooting attack , claiming that allowing ISIL to use the platform constituted the provision of material support of a terrorist organization , which is illegal under U.S. federal law . Twitter disputed the claim , stating that " violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter and , like other social networks , our rules make that clear . " The Electronic Frontier Foundation believed that Twitter could be protected under Section 230 safe harbors , which dictate that the operators of an interactive computer service are not liable for the content published by others . 
 On May 31 , 2016 , Twitter suspended multiple parody accounts that satirized Russian politics , sparking protests and raising questions about where the company stands on freedom of speech . Following public outcry , Twitter restored the accounts the next day without answering why the accounts were suspended . The same day , Twitter , along with Facebook , Google , and Microsoft , jointly agreed to a European Union code of conduct obligating them to review " [ the ] majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech " posted on their services within 24 hours .

 In May 2008 , The Wall Street Journal wrote that social networking services such as Twitter " elicit mixed feelings in the technology @-@ savvy people who have been their early adopters .

But some users are starting to feel ' too ' connected , as they grapple with check @-@ in messages at odd hours , higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they 're having for dinner .

 Twitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational and research settings mostly in colleges and universities .

 Tech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 that using Twitter for " literate communication " is " about as likely as firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad " . In September 2008 , the journalist Clive Thompson mused in a The New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into " a new , <unk> extreme — the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity @-@ addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating and ought to be shared with the world " . One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity related twitter @-@ like disclosures dates from 1980 , when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round the clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller , even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis . Conversely , Vancouver Sun columnist Steve <unk> opined that part of Twitter 's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints , and Jonathan Zittrain , professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School , said that " the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half @-@ baked are what makes it so powerful " . 
 The novelist Rick Moody wrote a short story for Electric Literature called " Some Contemporary Characters , " composed entirely of tweets . 
 In 2009 , Nielsen Online reported that Twitter has a user retention rate of forty percent . Many people stop using the service after a month , therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all Internet users . In 2009 , Twitter won the " Breakout of the Year " Webby Award . During a February 2009 discussion on National Public Radio 's Weekend Edition , the journalist Daniel Schorr stated that Twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous fact @-@ checking and other editorial improvements . In response , Andy Carvin gave Schorr two examples of breaking news stories that played out on Twitter and said users wanted first @-@ hand accounts and sometimes debunked stories . On November 29 , 2009 Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the Global Language Monitor , declaring it " a new form of social interaction " . Time magazine acknowledged its growing level of influence in its 2010 Time 100 ; to determine the influence of people , it used a formula based on famous social networking sites , Twitter and Facebook . The list ranges from Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey to Lady Gaga and Ashton Kutcher . The U.S. government , seeing social media 's role in the 2010 Arab Spring revolts , covertly developed a Cuban alternative to Twitter called <unk> as part of a long @-@ term strategy to " stir unrest " . The service was active from 2010 to 2012 . 
 During the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony , in which he appeared at the London Olympic Stadium in person , Sir Tim Berners @-@ Lee , the founder of the World Wide Web , tweeted " This is for everyone " , which was instantly spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80 @,@ 000 people in the audience .

 World leaders and their diplomats have taken note of Twitter 's rapid expansion and have been increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy , the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens . US Ambassador to Russia , Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy . He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011 , posting in English and Russian . On October 24 , 2014 , Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark the opening of the London Science Museum 's Information Age exhibition . A 2013 study by website <unk> found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts . The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers , with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers . 
 According to an analysis of accounts , the heads of state of 125 countries and 139 other leading politicians have Twitter accounts that have between them sent more than 350 @,@ 000 tweets and have almost 52 million followers . However , only 30 of these do their own tweeting , more than 80 do not subscribe to other politicians and many do not follow any accounts .

 = = = = Twitterbot effect = = = = 
 Twitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture , products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication . The New York Times states , " They have sleep @-@ wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing , making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs . " The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing , all of which depends on the intention of the person purchasing or creating the bot . The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the <unk> Journal . Looking at the Computers as Social Actors ( CASA ) paradigm , the journal notes , " people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media , treating them as if they were real people or real places . " The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere . While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human @-@ Computer Interaction , the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm . Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular , push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation , spam and / or slander . 
 In addition to content generating bots , users can purchase followers , favorites , retweets and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a users image through accumulation of followers . With more followers , users ' profiles gain more attention , thus increasing their popularity . Generating Web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability . With Twitterbots , users are able to create the illusion of " buzz " on their site by obtaining followers from services such as <unk> and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms . The companies that facilitate this service create fake Twitter accounts that follow a number of people , some of these Twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real . This practice of obtaining mass amounts of <unk> as followers is not permitted on Twitter . The emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities , politicians , musicians , public figures , and companies alike . According to The New York Times , bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections , influence the stock market , public appeal , and attack governments .

 Twitter is also increasingly used for making TV more interactive and social . This effect is sometimes referred to as the second screen , " virtual watercooler " or social television — the practice has been called " <unk> " . Twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live TV events , such as the Oscars , the Super Bowl and the MTV Video Music Awards ; however this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled TV shows . Such direct cross @-@ promotions have been banned from French television due to regulations against secret advertising . 
 In December 2012 , Twitter and Nielsen entered a multi @-@ year agreement to produce social TV ratings , which are expected to be commercially available for the fall 2013 season as the Nielsen Twitter TV Rating . Advertising Age said Twitter had become the new TV Guide . Then in February 2013 , Twitter acquired Bluefin Labs for an estimated US $ 50 million to $ 100 million , which was the company 's largest acquisition as of 2013 . Founded in 2008 at the MIT Media Lab , Bluefin is a data miner whose analysis tells which brands ( e.g. , TV shows and companies ) are chatted about the most in social media . MIT Technology Review said that Bluefin gives Twitter part of the US $ 72 billion television advertising market . 
 In April 2013 , the Associated Press ' Twitter account was briefly hacked into , sending out a message that US president Barack Obama had been injured in an attack on the White House . Stocks lost $ 134 billion in value almost instantly , before recovering in value when it was discovered the report was false . 
 In May 2013 , it launched Twitter Amplify — an advertising product for media and consumer brands . With Amplify , Twitter runs video highlights from major live broadcasts , with advertisers ' names and messages playing before the clip . Then in October 2013 , Comcast announced a partnership with NBCUniversal and Twitter , to allow users to tune into live streaming from their set @-@ top box , smartphone or tablet by tapping a ' See It ' button embedded in selected tweets . 
 In an attempt to compete with Twitter 's leadership in TV , Facebook introduced a number of features in 2013 to drive conversation around TV including hashtags , verified profiles and embeddable posts . It also opened up new data visualization APIs for TV news and other media outlets , enabling them to search for a word and see a firehose of public posts that mention it as well as show how many people mentioned a word in both public and private posts during a set time frame , with a demographic breakdown of the age , gender , and location of these people . In January 2014 , Facebook announced a partnership with UK @-@ based social TV analytics company <unk> which saw the social network make its social TV available outside the company for the first time . Facebook struck the partnership to help marketers understand how people are using the social network to talk about topics such as TV . However , Twitter responded by acquiring <unk> and Parisian social TV firm <unk> three months later . These acquisitions , as well as a partnership with research company Kantar ( which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013 ) strengthened Twitter 's dominance of the " second screen " – TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media . With the additional analytic tools , Twitter was able to improve the firm 's offering to advertisers , allowing them to , for instance , only promote a tweet onto the timelines of users who were watching a certain programme . 
 By February 2014 , all four major U.S. TV networks had signed up to the Amplify program , bringing a variety of premium TV content onto the social platform in the form of in @-@ tweet real @-@ time video clips . In March 2014 , ITV became the first major broadcaster in the UK to sign up to Twitter Amplify and Twitter introduced one @-@ tap video playback across its mobile apps to further enhance the consumer experience . 
 In June 2014 , Twitter acquired its Twitter Amplify partner in the U.S. , <unk> , as part of its ongoing efforts to be the leader in social television . The company was helping broadcasters and rights holders to share video content both organically across social and via Twitter 's Amplify program . In Europe Twitter 's Amplify partner is London @-@ based <unk> , which has also struck numerous deals with broadcasters and rights holders to share video content across Facebook and Twitter . 
 On July 11 , 2016 , Twitter announced a partnership with CBS News to live stream both the 2016 Republican National Convention , July 18 @-@ 21 , and the 2016 Democratic National Convention , July 25 @-@ 28 .

In the episode , Marge 's sister Selma is looking for a husband , so Marge orders Homer to help her find one . Things go wrong , however , when Homer invites Principal Skinner over for dinner and Skinner instead falls for Selma 's twin sister Patty . 
 The episode was written by David M. Stern and directed by Mark Kirkland . The characters Hans Moleman , Groundskeeper Willie and Squeaky Voiced Teen make their first appearances on The Simpsons in the episode . " Principal Charming " features cultural references to film such as Vertigo , Gone with the Wind , and The Hunchback of Notre Dame . Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . It acquired a Nielsen rating of 14 @.@ 1 , and was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network the week it aired . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Selma realizes , after going to the wedding of a man that could have easily been hers if Patty had not intervened , that she needs to find a husband and begs Marge to help her . Marge enlists the help of Homer to seek one out ; however , Homer has trouble finding anyone suitable . Meanwhile , Bart pulls a big prank by pouring the fictional herbicide sodium tetrasulfate onto the grass of his school , spelling out his own name , and is caught when Skinner sees the mess . Homer meets with Principal Skinner about Bart 's behavior and , learning that Skinner is single , invites him home to dinner with Selma . Later that day , Skinner arrives for dinner , but instead of falling for Selma , he becomes instantly smitten with her sister , Patty after she yells at Homer for being the wrong twin . 
 Skinner asks an unwilling Patty out on a date and she tries to get out of it by refusing . However , as they are going home , Selma tells her that she needs to go on this date because she has not been with a man in 25 years and this would be her best chance to still have a family . On their first date , Patty does not seem impressed with Skinner until he yells at his former student for his lack of promptness . Soon after they go out on more dates , much to Selma 's chagrin and she realizes another decent man has just slipped past her . 
 Skinner enlists Bart 's help to get Patty to marry him , while Homer fixes a date between Selma and Barney , which Selma reluctantly accepts . However , Marge disapproves of Barney and demands Homer to find someone else suitable for her sister . Skinner takes Patty to the top of the bell tower to propose . Following Bart 's lead , he has written " Marry Me , Patty " in 40 @-@ foot letters using the sodium tetrasulfate that got Bart in trouble . Patty is flattered , but declines . She admits to Skinner that she shares a common bond with the emotional grief of her twin sister , which Skinner immediately understands . Patty appreciates Skinner 's understanding and his gentlemanly conduct , and if she ever did settle down with a man , she would want it to be with him . Rescuing Selma from her date with Barney , Patty takes her home . 
 Meanwhile , Skinner , who vows to win back his school from Bart 's control ( who was taking advantage of the fact that Skinner loves Patty and turned a blind eye from all of Bart 's recent vandalism ) , destroys all the grass on the school field with the sodium tetrasulfate , forcing Bart to replant the field seed by seed , much to Groundskeeper Willie 's pleasure . 
 = = Production = = 
 The episode was written by David M. Stern and directed by Mark Kirkland . Stern particularly liked writing episodes about Marge and her sisters Patty and Selma . Executive producer Mike Reiss said none of the staff members could relate on a personal level to the twins , but Stern " seemed to really hook in to them , so he did some great episodes featuring members of the Bouvier family . " Due to the episode 's romantic theme , the airdate was pushed back to Valentine 's Day on February 14 , 1991 . It was , however , ready to be aired several months earlier . 
 The characters Hans Moleman , Groundskeeper Willie and Squeaky Voiced Teen made their first appearances on the show in " Principal Charming " . Willie 's role in the episode was to punish Bart by making him re @-@ sod the grass . Originally , Willie was just written as an angry janitor , and the fact that he was Scottish was added during a recording session . Dan Castellaneta was assigned to do the voice , but he did not know what voice to use . Sam Simon , who was directing at the time , told Castellaneta to use an accent . He first tried using a Spanish voice , which Simon felt was too clichéd . He then tried a " big dumb Swede " , which was also rejected . For his third try , he used the voice of an angry Scotsman , which was deemed appropriate enough and was used in the episode . Originally thought by the directors to be a one @-@ shot appearance , Willie has since become a common recurring character . The show 's creator Matt Groening later revealed that the character was based partially on Angus Crock , a kilt @-@ wearing chef from the sketch comedy show Second City Television , who was portrayed by Dave Thomas , and Jimmy Finlayson , the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in thirty @-@ three Laurel and Hardy films . In addition to Willie , Castellaneta also provided the voice of Squeaky Voiced Teen , whose voice is lifted from actor Richard Crenna 's character Walter Denton in the sitcom Our Miss Brooks . Moleman 's voice was also provided by Castellaneta . He was given the name Moleman by Groening , who thought the character looked like a mole .

 In its original broadcast , " Principal Charming " finished thirty @-@ second in the ratings for the week of February 11 – 17 , 1991 , with a Nielsen rating of 14 @.@ 1 , equivalent to approximately thirteen million viewing households . It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week . 
 Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote : " Good fun , with both Patty and Selma gaining a degree of humanity . Bart makes very good use of his new @-@ found freedom as Skinner 's pseudo @-@ in @-@ law , much to the annoyance of Groundskeeper Willie , making his first appearance . " DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson wrote : " Many shows might have trouble concentrating on secondary characters like Skinner and Patty , but this episode worked nicely . Though the romantic tone could have become sappy , the program managed to stay on the right side of that equation , and it expanded the characters well . " Doug Pratt , a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor , wrote that " the [ episode ] is heavily character orientated but poignantly comical " . A member of the IGN staff wrote in a season two review : " There are some real winners to be found in the second season , and I was actually surprised at some of the episodes in the collection because I thought they were later in the series , like [ ... ] ' Principal Charming ' , where Skinner falls for Patty . " 
 Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic said " Principal Charming " was the episode that made it " clear that The Simpsons wasn 't just a smart little cartoon but something much , much more . " The episode 's references to Gone with the Wind and Terminator were named the sixth and fifth greatest film references in the history of the show by Nathan Ditum of Total Film . Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought the best line of the episode was Moe 's line to the depressed Homer : " Homer , lighten up . You 're making happy hour bitterly ironic .

 = Saruman = 
 Saruman the White is a fictional character and a major antagonist in J. R. R. Tolkien 's fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings . He is leader of the Istari , wizards sent to Middle @-@ earth in human form by the godlike Valar to challenge Sauron , the main antagonist of the novel , but eventually he desires Sauron 's power for himself and tries to take over Middle @-@ earth by force . His schemes feature prominently in the second volume , The Two Towers , and at the end of the third volume , The Return of the King . His earlier history is given briefly in the posthumously published The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales . 
 Saruman is one of several characters in the book illustrating the corruption of power ; his desire for knowledge and order leads to his fall , and he rejects the chance of redemption when it is offered . The name Saruman [ <unk> ] means " man of skill " ; he serves as an example of technology and modernity being overthrown by forces more in tune with nature . Saruman is represented by a white hand .

 Saruman first appears in The Fellowship of the Ring ( 1954 ) , which is the first volume of The Lord of the Rings . The Lord of the Rings describes a quest to destroy the One Ring , a powerful and evil talisman created by the Dark Lord Sauron to control Middle @-@ earth ( the fictional continent on which Tolkien 's story takes place ) . Sauron lost the Ring in battle thousands of years before the beginning of the story , and it is now held in secret in the Shire by the hobbit Bilbo Baggins , who passes it on to Frodo Baggins , one of the story 's main protagonists . Early in The Fellowship of the Ring , the wizard Gandalf describes Saruman as " the chief of my order " and head of the White Council that forced Sauron from Mirkwood at the end of Tolkien 's earlier book The Hobbit . He notes Saruman 's great knowledge of the magic rings created by Sauron and by the Elven @-@ smiths . Shortly afterwards , Gandalf breaks an arrangement to meet Frodo and guide him out of the Shire to Rivendell to keep the Ring safe from Sauron 's agents . 
 Frodo and Gandalf are reunited at Rivendell midway through The Fellowship of the Ring . The wizard explains why he failed to join Frodo : he had been summoned to consult with Saruman but had been held captive . Saruman initially had proposed that the wizards ally themselves with the rising power of Sauron in order to eventually control him for their own ends . Saruman went on to suggest that they could take the Ring for themselves and challenge Sauron . When Gandalf refused both options , variously because the Ring can only be wielded by one person ; because the Ring would merely channel a powerful user to become just another dark lord ; and mostly because he now recognized Saruman as a traitor , Gandalf was imprisoned in the tower of Orthanc at Isengard . Saruman hoped to learn from him the location of the Ring . Whilst on the summit of Orthanc Gandalf observed that Saruman had industrialised the formerly green valley of Isengard and was creating his own army of Half @-@ Orcs / Half @-@ Human fighters who are able to endure the sun and wolves to rival Sauron . Gandalf 's escape from the roof on the back of a Great Eagle left Saruman in a desperate position as he knew he would now be known as traitor to his former allies , but was unable to procure the Ring directly for himself and therefore could not hope to truly rival his enemy Sauron . 
 In The Two Towers ( 1954 ) , the second volume of the story , Saruman is the main antagonist . Orcs from Saruman 's army in search of the Ring attack Frodo and his companions . Following Saruman 's orders to capture hobbits , they carry off two of Frodo 's closest friends , Merry and Pippin . The two escape into Fangorn Forest , where they meet the Ents , protectors of the trees , who are outraged at the widespread felling of trees by Saruman 's orcs . Meanwhile , Saruman 's army has invaded the land of Rohan , with the effect of preventing the Riders of Rohan from joining the fight against Sauron . Having betrayed Sauron by attempting unsuccessfully to seize the Ring for himself , Saruman is ruined when the Riders of Rohan defeat his army and Merry and Pippin prompt the Ents to destroy Isengard . Saruman himself is not directly involved , and only appears again in chapter 10 , " The Voice of Saruman " , by which time he is trapped in Orthanc . He fails in his attempt to negotiate with the Rohirrim and with Gandalf , and rejects Gandalf 's conditional offer to let him go free . Gandalf casts him out of the White Council and the order of the wizards , and breaks Saruman 's staff . 
 Saruman makes his final appearance at the end of the last volume , The Return of the King ( 1955 ) , after Sauron 's defeat . After persuading the Ents to release him from Orthanc , he travels north on foot , apparently reduced to begging . He is accompanied by his servant <unk> Wormtongue , whom he beats and curses . When they reach the Shire , Saruman 's agents — both Hobbits and Men — have already taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization . Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until the events of chapter 8 ( " The Scouring of the Shire " ) in which Frodo and his companions return and lead a rebellion , defeating the intruders and exposing Saruman 's role . Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo , Frodo lets him go ; but Wormtongue , whom Saruman continues to taunt , finally murders him .

 Consistent accounts of Saruman 's earlier history appear in Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings , first published in The Return of the King , and in the posthumously published The Silmarillion ( 1977 ) and Unfinished Tales ( 1980 ) . All were written in the mid @-@ 1950s . Saruman , like Gandalf and Radagast the Brown , is one of five ' wizards ' , known as the Istari , who begin to arrive in Middle @-@ earth circa two thousand years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings . They are <unk> , envoys of the godlike Valar sent to challenge Sauron by inspiring the people of Middle @-@ earth rather than by direct conflict . Tolkien regarded them as being somewhat like incarnate angels . Saruman initially travelled in the east ; he was later appointed head of the White Council and eventually settles at Gondor 's outpost of Isengard . Fifty years before The Lord of the Rings , after his studies reveal that the One Ring might be found in the river Anduin near Sauron 's stronghold at Dol Guldur , he helps the White Council drive out Sauron in order to facilitate his search . 
 Unfinished Tales also contains various drafts not included in The Lord of the Rings that describe Saruman 's attempts to frustrate Sauron 's chief servants , the Nazgûl , in their search for the Ring during the early part of The Fellowship of the Ring ; in one version he considers throwing himself on Gandalf 's mercy . There is also a description of how Saruman became involved with the Shire and of how he gradually becomes jealous of Gandalf . Another brief account describes how the five Istari were chosen by the Valar for their mission . 
 = = Creation and development = = 
 Tolkien had been writing The Lord of the Rings for several years when Saruman came into existence as the solution to a long @-@ unresolved plot development , and his role and characteristics continued to emerge in the course of writing . Tolkien started work on the book in late 1937 , but was initially unsure of how the story would develop . Unlike some of the other characters in the book , Saruman had not appeared in Tolkien 's 1937 novel , The Hobbit , or in his then @-@ unpublished Quenta Silmarillion and related mythology , which date back to 1917 . [ a ] When he wrote of Gandalf ’ s failure to meet Frodo , Tolkien did not know what had caused it and later said : " Most disquieting of all , Saruman had never been revealed to me , and I was as concerned as Frodo at Gandalf 's failure to appear . " Tolkien 's son , Christopher , has said that the early stages of the creation of The Lord of the Rings proceeded in a series of waves , and that having produced the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring , Tolkien rewrote the tale from the start three times . Saruman first appeared during a fourth phase of writing in a rough narrative outline dated August 1940 . Intended to account for Gandalf 's absence , it describes how a wizard titled " <unk> the White " or " <unk> the Grey " , who has fallen under the influence of Sauron , lures Gandalf to his stronghold and traps him . The full story of Saruman 's betrayal was later added to the existing chapters . 
 Several of Saruman ’ s other appearances in the book emerged in the process of writing . Christopher Tolkien believes that the old man seen by Aragorn , Legolas and Gimli at the edge of Fangorn forest near the beginning of The Two Towers is in the original drafts intended to be Gandalf . In the finished version he is Saruman . Similarly , in the first drafts of the chapter The Scouring of the Shire , Sharkey is successively a ruffian met by the hobbits and then that man ’ s unseen boss . It is only in the second draft of the chapter that , as Christopher Tolkien puts it , his father “ perceive [ d ] ” that Sharkey was in fact Saruman . The name used by Saruman 's henchmen for their diminished leader is said in a footnote to the final text to be derived from an <unk> term meaning " old man " . Saruman 's death scene , in which his body shrivels away to skin and bones revealing " long years of death " and " a pale shrouded figure " rises over the corpse , was not added until the page proofs of the completed book were being reviewed by Tolkien . John D. Rateliff and Jared Lobdell are among those to write that the scene shows similarities to the death of the 2000 @-@ year @-@ old sorceress Ayesha in H. Rider Haggard 's 1887 novel She : A History of Adventure . 
 = = Characterization = = 
 Tolkien described Saruman at the time of The Lord of the Rings as having a long face and a high forehead , " ... he had deep darkling eyes ... His hair and beard were white , but strands of black still showed around his lips and ears . " His hair is elsewhere described as having been black when he first arrived in Middle @-@ earth . He is referred to as ' Saruman the White ' and is said to have originally worn white robes , but on his first entry in The Fellowship of the Ring they instead appear to be " woven from all colours [ , they ] <unk> and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered " and he names himself ' Saruman of Many Colours ' . 
 The power of Saruman 's voice is noted throughout the book . Jonathan Evans calls the characterization of Saruman in the chapter The Voice of Saruman a " tour de force " . Roger Sale says of the same chapter that " Tolkien valiantly tried to do something worth doing which he simply cannot bring off . " Tom Shippey writes that " Saruman talks like a politician ... No other character in Middle @-@ earth has Saruman 's trick of balancing phrases against each other so that <unk> are resolved , and none comes out with words as empty as ' deploring ' , ' ultimate ' , worst of all , ' real ' . What is ' real change ' ? " Shippey contrasts this modern speech pattern with the archaic stoicism and directness that Tolkien employs for other characters such as the Dwarven King Dáin , which Shippey believes represent Tolkien 's view of heroism in the mould of Beowulf . 
 After the defeat of his armies , having been caught in the betrayal of Sauron , Saruman is offered refuge by Gandalf , in return for his aid , but having chosen his path , is unable to turn from it . Evans has compared the character of Saruman to that of Satan in John Milton 's Paradise Lost in his use of rhetoric and in this final refusal of redemption , " conquered by pride and hatred " . 
 = = Literary themes = = 
 Saruman has been identified by critics as demonstrating the fall of an originally good character , and has distinctively modern connections with technology . Tolkien writes that The Lord of the Rings was often criticised for portraying all characters as either good or bad , with no shades of grey , a point to which he responds by proposing Saruman , along with Denethor and Boromir , as examples of characters with more nuanced loyalties . Marjorie Burns writes that while Saruman is an " imitative and lesser " double of Sauron , reinforcing the Dark Lord 's character type , he is also a contrasting double of Gandalf , who becomes Saruman as he " should have been " , after Saruman fails in his original purpose . 
 Saruman " was great once , of a noble kind that we should not dare raise our hands against " but decays as the book goes on . Patricia Meyer Spacks calls him " one of the main case histories [ in the book ] of the gradual destructive effect of willing submission to evil wills " . Paul Kocher identifies Saruman 's use of a <unk> , a seeing @-@ stone , as the immediate cause of his downfall , but also suggests that through his study of " the arts of the enemy " , Saruman was drawn into imitation of Sauron . According to Jonathan Evans and Spacks , Saruman succumbs to the lust for power , while Shippey identifies Saruman 's devotion to goals of knowledge , organization and control as his weakness . Tolkien writes that the Istari 's chief temptation ( and that to which Saruman fell ) is impatience , leading to a desire to force others to do good , and then to a simple desire for power . 
 Treebeard describes Saruman as having " a mind of metal and wheels " . Evil in The Lord of the Rings tends to be associated with machinery , whereas good is usually associated with nature . Both Saruman 's stronghold of Isengard and his altered Shire demonstrate the negative effects of industrialization and Isengard is overthrown when the forests , in the shape of the Ents , literally rise against it . Patrick Curry says Tolkien is " hostile to industrialism " , linking this to the widespread urban development that took place in the West Midlands where Tolkien grew up in the first decades of the 20th century . He identifies Saruman as one of the key examples given in the book of the evil effects of industrialization , and by extension imperialism . Shippey notes that Saruman 's name repeats this view of technology : in the Mercian dialect of Anglo @-@ Saxon used by Tolkien to represent the Language of Rohan in the book , the root word <unk> means " clever " , " skillful " or " ingenious " and has associations with both technology and treachery that are fitting for Tolkien 's portrayal of Saruman , the " cunning man " . He also writes of Saruman 's distinctively modern association with Communism in the way the Shire is run under his control : goods are taken " for fair distribution " which , since they are mainly never seen again , Shippey terms an unusually modern piece of hypocrisy in the way evil presents itself in Middle @-@ earth . 
 Saruman is in part the architect of his own downfall . Kocher , Randall Helms and Shippey write that Saruman 's actions in the first half of The Two Towers , although intended to further his own interests , in fact lead to his defeat and that of Sauron : his orcs help split the Fellowship at <unk> Galen , and in carrying off two of the hobbits initiate a series of incidents that lead to his ruin . In turn this frees the Rohirrim to intervene at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and then together with the men of Gondor to assault Sauron 's stronghold of Mordor and distract him from Frodo 's final effort to destroy the Ring . Shippey says that this demonstrates the value of persistence in the face of despair , even if a way out cannot be seen ; Kocher and Helms write that it is part of a pattern of providential events and of the reversed effects of evil intentions throughout the book . 
 In the end , the diminished Saruman is murdered , his throat cut , and Shippey notes that when he dies his spirit " dissolved into nothing " . He identifies Saruman as the best example in the book of " <unk> " , a distinctive 20th @-@ century view of evil that he attributes to Tolkien in which individuals are " ' eaten up inside ' by devotion to some abstraction " . Referring to Saruman 's demise , Kocher says that he is one example of the consistent theme of nothingness as the fate of evil throughout The Lord of the Rings . 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 Saruman has appeared in film , audio and stage adaptations of The Lord of the Rings . BBC Radio produced the first adaptation in 1956 , which has not survived . Tolkien was apparently disappointed by it . 
 In Ralph Bakshi 's 1978 animated adaptation of The Lord of the Rings , which corresponds to The Fellowship of the Ring and part of The Two Towers , Saruman is voiced by Fraser Kerr . He has only one major scene — his attempt to persuade Gandalf to join him . He appears again briefly before the battle of Helm 's Deep , speaking to his army . The character is dressed in red and is called ' Saruman ' and ' <unk> ' at different points . Smith and Matthews suggest that the use of ' <unk> ' was intended to avoid confusion with ' Sauron ' . The 1980 Rankin / Bass TV animated version of The Return of the King begins roughly where Bakshi 's film ends but does not include Saruman 's character . 
 BBC Radio 's second adaptation of The Lord of the Rings , from 1981 , presents Saruman much as in the books . Smith and Matthews report Peter Howell 's performance as Saruman as " brilliantly ambiguous [ ... ] , drifting from mellifluous to almost <unk> savage from moment to moment without either mood seeming to contradict the other " . 
 Saruman is played by Matti <unk> in the 1993 television miniseries <unk> that was produced and aired by Finnish broadcaster Yle . 
 In Peter Jackson 's film trilogy ( 2001 – 2003 ) , Saruman is significantly more active in the first two films than in their equivalent books , and he appears in several scenes that are not depicted in Tolkien 's work . In the films , Saruman is depicted presenting himself outright as a servant of Sauron . Smith and Matthews suggest that Saruman 's role is built up as a substitute for Sauron — the story 's main antagonist — who never appears directly in the book . Jackson confirms this view in the commentary to the DVD . They also suggest that having secured veteran British horror actor Christopher Lee to play Saruman , it made sense to make greater use of his star status . Despite this increased role in the first two films , the scenes involving Saruman that were shot for use in the third film , The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King , were not used in the cinematic release , a decision which " shocked " Lee . Jackson reasoned that it would be anticlimactic to show Saruman 's fate in the second movie ( after the Battle of Helm 's Deep ) and too retrospective for it to be in the third one . The cut scenes end with Saruman falling to his death from the top of Orthanc after being stabbed by Wormtongue and include material from the chapter The Scouring of the Shire . They are included at the start of the Extended Edition DVD release of the film . 
 In Jackson 's adaptation of the prequel , The Hobbit , Lee reprises his role as Saruman the White , even though Saruman does not appear in the novel . Saruman , Gandalf , Galadriel , and Elrond appear at a meeting of the White Council in Rivendell ( loosely based on material from the Appendices ) , which discusses the mysterious Necromancer encountered by Radagast the Brown . Saruman tells Gandalf that the Necromancer is just a mortal man and that Radagast is a foolish fellow because of his consumption of mushrooms . Saruman also disapproves of Thorin and the dwarves ' quest because it will wake the sleeping dragon , though Gandalf and Galadriel fear that if Sauron reappears , the dragon will join his forces eventually . Gandalf presumed that Saruman would disapprove , so he had Thorin & Co. leave Rivendell before the council began . In the final film , Saruman and Elrond accompany Galadriel to Dol Guldur where they engage the resurrected wraiths of the Nazgûl in battle . After dispatching the Ringwraiths , Saruman and Elrond assist as Galadriel uses the power of her Ring to fight Sauron and banishes him from the fortress back to Mordor . Although Elrond insists that they need to hunt down Sauron , Saruman tells him to remain with Galadriel , who was severely weakened during the battle with Sauron , while he takes care of the Dark Lord . 
 In the 2014 video game Middle @-@ earth : Shadow of Mordor the protagonist , Talion , finds various artifacts that reveal that Saruman 's spies are active within the borders of Mordor in the years between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings . Saruman is later revealed to be controlling Queen Marwen of the <unk> in order to hinder Sauron while also bringing about the destruction of the men of <unk> . He is voiced by Roger Jackson in the game . 
 = Weezer ( 2001 album ) = 
 Weezer ( also known as The Green Album ) is the third studio album by the American alternative rock band Weezer , released on May 15 , 2001 , through Geffen Records . Produced by Ric Ocasek , this is the only Weezer album to feature bassist Mikey Welsh , who replaced Matt Sharp . The album is grounded in the power pop genre , featuring strong melodies , crisp vocal harmonies , and prominent guitar riffs . It is also Weezer 's quickest @-@ selling album . 
 Weezer received generally favorable reviews . The album was often recognized as a rebirth for the band , after a five @-@ year hiatus following their 1996 's album Pinkerton . The album attained chart success by debuting at number 4 in the US and number 2 in Canada . The album also charted within the top ten in Norway and Sweden . Since its release in 2001 , the album has sold over 1 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 copies in the United States . 
 Three singles were released from the album , including " Hash Pipe " , " Island in the Sun " , and " Photograph " . Its first single , " Hash Pipe " , was a worldwide modern rock hit , charting on seven different charts , despite their record label 's reluctance to release it as the first single . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 Following the commercial and critical failure of Pinkerton ( 1996 ) , Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo placed the band on hiatus . He returned to Harvard University to finish his studies , but eventually dropped out to focus on songwriting . During this time , Cuomo played with a different group of musicians in the band Homie , based in Boston . One of the members of Homie was Mikey Welsh , a bass player who would eventually be asked to replace Matt Sharp in Weezer . 
 By February 1998 , Cuomo had quietly disbanded Homie and headed to Los Angeles to begin work on Weezer demos with Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson . At this point , bassist Matt Sharp was absent from numerous Weezer rehearsals and was becoming estranged from the band . On April 8 , 1998 , Sharp announced his official exit from Weezer to devote all his energies to his band , The Rentals . It was quickly announced that former Homie member Welsh would take over on bass for Weezer . Frustration and creative disagreements led to a decline in rehearsals , and , in the latter half of 1998 , drummer Patrick Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo , who went into a period of admitted depression , during which he painted the walls of his home black and put " fiberglass insulation all over the windows and then black sheets of fiberglass so that no light could get through . " 
 By the beginning of 1999 , Weezer had once again gone their separate ways . Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side @-@ band The Special Goodness , guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield . Meanwhile , Cuomo focused his energy on songwriting , crafting 121 songs , nearly half of which would become demos . During this time , he isolated himself and abstained from contact with the outside world . Cuomo also received braces on his teeth , further damaging his self @-@ esteem . Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him . In turn , Cuomo would eventually reveal songs he was working on to Bell . 
 Unbeknownst to the band , their fanbase was connecting and growing on the internet , which was helping to boost the reputation and sales of Pinkerton . When it was released , Pinkerton was considered a critical and commercial failure ; however , in the years following the release of the album , it would gain a much more positive reputation due to word @-@ of @-@ mouth on message boards and various web pages . This expanding internet activity would later set the stage for the band 's 2001 comeback . Renewed interaction between band members took place when Weezer was offered a lucrative offer to perform in Japan in August 2000 for the Summer Sonic Festival . Rehearsals for the show reinvigorated the band into talking about making a new album . The band returned to performing in June 2000 , playing low @-@ key shows around Los Angeles under the pseudonym Goat Punishment , ensuring that Weezer would only perform for longtime fans who would recognize the name . 
 Eventually , the band started performing at higher profile gigs such as the Warped Tour . Cuomo later remarked , " We went in there fully expecting to be booed and to have things thrown at us . But it was exactly the opposite , people were singing along to all the songs and just going crazy , giving us the best support . And I think that gave us the confidence we needed . " The positive response to the Warped Tour performances led to further shows being scheduled . When touring began to wind down , MP3 demos captured live on the band 's mobile unit and sound checks began to surface on file @-@ sharing services and eventually for downloading on the band 's official website . These songs were often referred to as Summer Songs of 2000 ( commonly abbreviated as <unk> ) . 
 = = Recording = = 
 On October 23 , Cuomo announced that the band would start recording material " with or without " a producer . However , the band 's record label decided to have the band employ a record producer due to the commercial failure of their self @-@ produced album Pinkerton . The band began rehearsing and arranging both the Summer Songs of 2000 and newer material Cuomo had written at his home with engineer Chad Bamford . The band eventually decided to hire Ric Ocasek — who had also produced their debut album — as producer , and began sending demos to Ocasek during the summer of 2000 . There was much debate among the band members as to whether they should record in Los Angeles or Ocasek 's New York home , with the band eventually deciding to record in Los Angeles at Cello Studios . The band continued to demo new music daily and started to weed through more than seventy @-@ five demos , eventually homing in on twenty @-@ five potential album tracks in anticipation of Ocasek 's arrival . Ocasek worked with the band to trim these down further to eighteen songs . 
 Recording sessions for the album began in early December , with Ocasek providing creative feedback to the band by telephone . On December 27 , the band embarked on what would be close to six weeks of studio work by playing songs repetitively in order to track the bass and drums parts . They also did " scratch takes " of the vocals and guitar , designed to get accurate rhythm tracks before being redone more efficiently later in the recording process . While recording the album , the band continued to perform gigs under the pseudonym Goat Punishment . 
 During the recording sessions , an executive at the band 's label , Geffen Records , visited to observe the band 's progress and expressed dissatisfaction with several tracks . This feedback eventually forced the band to discard a few of the album 's possible songs . The band then relocated for three weeks to a smaller studio in another part of Cello Studios where Cuomo and Bell worked on guitar takes while the entire band recorded vocal tracks . Ocasek said : " Rivers always does his guitar parts in one take . " 
 Mixing for the album began on January 31 by Tom Lord @-@ Alge at South Beach Studios . Bell was absent from the mixing process .

 The art direction of the album was handled by Chris Bilheimer with photography from Marina Chavez and Karl Koch . The album cover was shot between band practices and featured Mikey Welsh , Rivers Cuomo , Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson standing left to right in front of a plain , lime @-@ green backdrop in a manner similar to the band 's debut album . This was done as a tribute to Ric Ocasek , who had also produced their first album , and also to symbolize the band 's back @-@ to @-@ basics approach they took while recording the album . This approach is alluded to in a quote in the liner notes of the album : " <unk> all <unk> e <unk> un <unk> " , from Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi that means " Let us return to old times and that will be progress . " 
 The picture inside of the CD booklet is a photo of Weezer playing live , featuring ( in the lower right hand corner ) an overlay of the silhouettes of Mike Nelson , Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot from the television show Mystery Science Theater 3000 . ( Hence the liner note citation " MST3K silhouette appears courtesy of Best Brains , Inc . " ) 
 This was Weezer 's first album to feature a transparent CD tray . Under the CD tray of the album , the word " No " can be found on the back of the spine . Some fans speculate that this is a response to the inside tray of Radiohead 's album OK Computer which contains the text " I like you . I like you . You are a wonderful person . I 'm full of enthusiasm . I 'm going places . I 'll be happy to help you . I am an important person , would you like to come home with me ? " Weezer 's official explanation was vague , with webmaster Karl Koch stating " No means no . " 
 The album contains the dedication " In loving memory of Mykel and Carli . " Mykel and Carli Allan were sisters devoted to developing fan clubs for up @-@ and @-@ coming bands . The sisters had been influential in starting and developing Weezer 's official fan club in the 1990s and , along with their young sister <unk> , died in a car accident in 1997 .

 The album was met with enthusiasm from the record label ; according to Weezer collaborator Karl Koch , " They had nothing but supportive and excited things to say about it . " However , the album 's original release date of April 17 was postponed due to executives not liking Cuomo 's choice of " Hash Pipe " as the first single . Citing the song 's lurid content about a transvestite prostitute as inappropriate , they suggested that " Don 't Let Go " be chosen as the first single . However , Cuomo continued to fight and " Hash Pipe " eventually became the album 's first single . The label tried to postpone the release date further until June , but the band convinced them to adhere to the original May 15 release date .

 The first single from the album was " Hash Pipe " . The video for " Hash Pipe " was directed by Marcos Siega and was the first of many Weezer videos that Siega would direct . In the video , Weezer performs in an arena while a group of sumo wrestlers are fighting in the background . The song title was often censored as " H * * * Pipe " ( the title employed on the music video 's title card ) or " Half Pipe . " The song became a huge hit on the MTV show Total Request Live , and also received heavy rotation on radio , eventually peaking at number two on the US Modern Rock Charts . The song even landed the band a nomination for High Times magazine 's " Pot Song of the Year " . 
 The next single , " Island in the Sun " , was a successful radio hit and became one of the band 's biggest oversea hits . It peaked at number 11 on the US Modern Rock Charts and at number 31 on the UK Top 40 . Two music videos were created for the song : the first video , directed by Marcos Siega , shows Weezer playing the song at a Mexican couple 's wedding reception and features all four band members . This version remains the more obscure of the two , receiving less airplay than the second . The executives at MTV disliked Siega 's video , prompting the band to film a second video . This second version was directed by Spike Jonze and featured the band playing with various wild animals on a supposedly remote hill ( although it was actually filmed a short distance outside of Los Angeles , possibly near Simi Valley ) . Only Brian Bell , Rivers Cuomo and Patrick Wilson appear in this video , as then bassist Mikey Welsh had left the band shortly before shooting . It is also rumored that original bassist Matt Sharp was approached to be in the video , though it is unclear if the offer was ever actually made . Scott Shriner , who was filling in for Welsh and would later become a permanent member of Weezer , stated in the commentary for " Video Capture Device " that he almost asked the band to let him appear in the video . The second video received much wider airplay than the original and has become the standard video for the song . 
 The third and final single from the album was " Photograph " , which was released to radio in early November . The single peaked at number 17 on the US Modern Rock Charts . In Japan it was released as the first single instead of " Hash Pipe . " The band felt the song didn 't have the staying power of the previous singles , and thus decided to pass on a big @-@ name director for the music video , opting instead to have Karl Koch shoot and edit a video from on @-@ the @-@ road footage .

 Weezer received generally favorable reviews . At Metacritic , which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 73 out of 100 . AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine , who gave the album a rating of four and a half stars , stated that " this may seem like nothing special -- it 's just punk @-@ pop , delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody else does it this [ sic ] so well , no matter how many bands try . " PopMatters ' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review , praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again : " The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words . And even the songs ' lengths are nice and compact . Weezer comes in , plays the song , and exits . No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again . Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board was one of the best ideas the band had , as The Green Album is certainly water tight all around . " Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review , saying " After creating the two greatest pop @-@ rock records in existence it 's time to add a third . One listen to The Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo 's hand just like in the past . [ ... ] Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song @-@ writers that has picked up a guitar . Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek @-@ rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes . Sorry to be blunt but it 's the way it is . God I think the sun 's finally taking its toll . " The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001 , tying with System of a Down 's Toxicity and Mogwai 's Rock Action . Q listed Weezer as one of the best 50 albums of 2001 . 
 Not all the reviews were complimentary . Spencer Owen , writing in Pitchfork Media , called the album " average from beginning to end . " In addition , Sarah Dempster from NME was disappointed with the album and said , " The most irritating aspect of The Green Album is , however , the maddening itch of wasted opportunity . "

 Trevor Munson conceived the character of Mick Angel in 2004 and spent two and a half years writing a novel featuring the character . The story was adapted into a feature film script , and Bruce Willis was considered as a possibility for the lead role . The script was shown to Nina Tassler at CBS , who paired Munson with Ron Koslow , creator of Beauty and the Beast , to rewrite the script as a television series . The series was titled Twilight , and Koslow and Munson wrote the pilot , which Warner Bros. Television initially commissioned as a presentation lasting 14 – 20 minutes in January 2007 . Joel Silver and Gerard Bocaccio were hired to be executive producers on the project under the former 's production banner , Silver Pictures , in the same month . Alex O 'Loughlin and Shannon Lucio were cast in the presentation , and Rod Holcomb was hired as director . The project was renamed Moonlight when picked up by CBS on May 14 , 2007 , prior the upfronts . David Greenwalt , creator of Miracles and co @-@ creator of Angel , joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and executive producer alongside Silver . CBS had hired Greenwalt during the pilot process to restructure the original concept by Koslow and Munson , but health reasons forced Greenwalt to leave the series , and Chip Johannessen took over showrunner duties in August 2007 . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 During Greenwalt 's restructuring of the pilot , all of the original actors save for the male lead role of Mick St. John were recast in June 2007 : Shannon Lucio , Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were originally cast in the roles of Beth Turner , Josef Kostan and Coraline Duvall respectively before Sophia Myles , Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them . With an almost entirely different cast , a retooled , full @-@ length pilot for television audiences was re @-@ shot . Joel Silver approached Dohring " out of the blue and said , ' There 's a role , and I 'm making it younger ' " . Dohring read two pages of script featuring Josef , and was interested by the character 's " dark " and " sharp " personality . Dohring had to go through the normal audition process and was not sure if he would have gotten the role without Silver , who had " pushed it all the way through to the end " . 
 Munson explained that the goal of the casting changes was " to lighten the show up a bit " . He believed the changes granted the studio 's and network 's wish to " make it a little younger and hipper " . O 'Loughlin felt that the whole cast 's becoming " a little bit younger " especially affected the character Josef , as the originally chosen actor , Šerbedžija , was twice Jason Dohring 's age . The creators and the network were concerned that Josef , whose relationship with Mick was important , would appear as more of a " father figure " rather than as a friend . O 'Loughlin supported the recasting of Josef with a younger actor due to the resulting " level of ease in that age difference " .

 The pilot introduces Mick St. John , a private investigator who has been a vampire for over fifty years . Mick meets Beth Turner , a reporter for the online newspaper BuzzWire , at the scene of the murder of a young woman . Mick and Beth begin investigating the crime together , helping each other to catch the killer . Flashbacks to 22 years ago show a domestic fight between Mick and his ex @-@ wife Coraline Duvall over a kidnapped girl . Mick lights the house on fire and rescues the girl , leaving Coraline to the fire .

In the present , Beth discovers that Mick is a vampire , and Mick reveals how one becomes a vampire and tells her the story of how he was turned by his bride , Coraline , on their wedding night . 
 Beth asks Mick to help her friend Morgan find her stolen cameras . When he meets her , Mick is completely shocked ; Morgan is identical to his ex @-@ wife , Coraline . He becomes even more confused when his vampiric sense of smell tells him that Morgan is human . Mick tries to expose Morgan as Coraline , but finally comes to believe that she is a doppelgänger when he sees that she does not have the fleur de lis tattoo on her shoulder as Coraline did . When alone , Morgan scrubs away the heavy makeup that has been covering the tattoo . Beth snoops through Mick 's property , and finds out Mick was the one who protected her as a little girl when she was kidnapped . Morgan goes with Mick to his apartment to clean up after almost getting hit by a car . Mick joins her in the shower and finally sees the tattoo on her shoulder , revealing her identity as Coraline . When Beth learns that Morgan is really Coraline , the lady who kidnapped her as a child , she goes to Mick 's apartment and stabs her with a wooden stake , narrowly missing her heart , not realizing that she has become human .

Beth tells Mick that she cannot continue to date him because of their vampire @-@ human situation , but Mick says that he loves her and they kiss . 
 = = = Vampire mythology = = = 
 The conventions of Moonlight are based , in part , on a unique mythology . Some parts of the mythology that are common include a sire , that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire ; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one . A vampire 's bite is not enough to turn a human into a vampire ; the human , when near death , must drink the sire 's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death . The process of <unk> also affects their genetics , causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies ' new state . This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned , such as a lock of hair . They must consume human blood to survive . They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past . This ability , along with their night vision , is an extension of their heightened senses . Daylight does not kill vampires , but does make them progressively weaker . Silver and fire are toxic , whereas garlic , holy water and crucifixes are useless . A vampire 's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film ; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion . Though undead , vampires have a pulse , are not cold blooded ( but still don 't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won 't see them ) , and cannot turn into a bat . The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning ; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis . Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology ; they have superhuman strength and speed , they heal rapidly from any wound , they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats , their bite has hypnotic effects on weak @-@ minded humans , and they are immortal . Their powers increase as they get older . Their blood has drug @-@ like affects when consumed by humans ; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses .

It follows the lives of Tod , a red fox raised by a human for the first year of his life , and Copper , a half @-@ bloodhound dog owned by a local hunter , referred to as the Master . After Tod causes the death of the man 's favorite hound , man and dog relentlessly hunt the fox , against the dual backdrops of a changing human world and Tod 's normal life in hunting for food , seeking a mate , and defending his territory . As preparation for writing the novel , Mannix studied foxes , both tame and wild , a wide variety of hunting techniques , and the ways hounds appear to track foxes , seeking to ensure his characters acted realistically . 
 The novel won the Dutton Animal Book Award in 1967 , which resulted in its publication on September 11 that year by E.P. Dutton . It was a 1967 Reader 's Digest Book Club selection and a winner of the Athenaeum Literary Award . It was well received by critics , who praised its detail and Mannix 's writing style . Walt Disney Productions purchased the film rights for the novel when it won the Dutton award , though did not begin production on an adaptation until 1977 . Heavily modified from the source material , Disney 's The Fox and the Hound was released to theaters in July 1981 and became a box office success .

During a bear hunt , Chief protects the Master when the bear turns on him , while Copper is too afraid of the bear to confront him .

 Tod is a red fox kit , raised as a pet by one of the human hunters who killed his mother and litter mates . Tod initially enjoys his life , but when he reaches sexual maturity he returns to the wild . During his first year , he begins establishing his territory , and learns evasion techniques from being hunted by local farm dogs . One day , he comes across the Master 's house and discovers that his presence sends the chained pack of dogs into a frustrated frenzy . He begins to delight in taunting them , until one day when Chief breaks his chain and chases him . The Master sees the dog escape and follows with Copper . As Chief skillfully trails the fox , Tod flees along a railroad track while a train is approaching , waiting to jump to safety until the last minute . Chief is killed by the train . 
 With Chief buried and Master crying over a dead dog he trains Copper to ignore all foxes except for Tod . Over the span of the two animals ' lives , man and dog hunt the fox , the Master using over a dozen hunting techniques in his quest for revenge . With each hunt , both dog and fox learn new tricks and methods to outsmart each other , Tod always escaping in the end . Tod mates with an older , experienced vixen who gives birth to a litter of kits . Before they are grown , the Master finds the den and gasses the kits to death . That winter , the Master sets out leg hold traps , which Tod carefully learns how to spring , but the vixen is caught and killed . In January , Tod takes a new mate , with whom he has another litter of kits . The Master uses a " still hunting " technique , in which he sits very quietly in the wood while playing a rabbit call to draw out the foxes . With this method , he kills the kits ; then by using the sound of a wounded fox kit , he is also able to draw out and kill Tod 's mate . 
 As the years pass , the rural area gives way to a more urbanized setting . New buildings and highways spring up , more housing developments are built , and the farmers are pushed out . Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult , Tod stays because it is his home range . The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers , and their natures change — life @-@ bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity , couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over . The Master has lost most of his own land , and the only dog he owns now is Copper . Each winter they still hunt Tod , and in an odd way he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains . 
 The Master spends most of his time drinking alcohol , and people begin trying to convince him to move into a nursing home , where no dogs are allowed . One summer , an outbreak of rabies spreads through the fox population . After one infected fox attacks a group of human children , the same people approach the Master and ask his help in killing the foxes . He uses traps and poison to try to kill as many foxes as possible ; however , the poison also kills domestic animals . After a human child dies from eating it , the humans remove all of the poison , then the Master organizes a hunt in which large numbers of people line up and walk straight into the woods , flushing out foxes to be shot . The aging Tod escapes all three events , as well as an attempt at coursing him with greyhounds . 
 One morning , after Tod 's escape from the greyhounds , the Master sends Copper on the hunt . After he picks up the fox 's trail , Copper relentlessly pursues him throughout the day and into the next morning . Tod finally drops dead of exhaustion , and Copper collapses on top of him , close to death himself . The Master nurses Copper back to health , and both enjoy their new popularity , but after a few months the excitement over Copper 's accomplishment dies down . The Master is left alone again , and returns to drinking . He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home , and this time he agrees . Crying , he takes his shotgun from the wall , leads Copper outside , and pets him gently before ordering him to lie down . He covers the dog 's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly .

 Desiring a realistic depiction of vulpine behavior and habits , Mannix spent more than a year studying the behaviors of a mated pair of foxes that he kept at his home . He stated that they were " so tame [ that he ] could turn them loose and watch them hunt , fight , make love , and live an almost normal life . " Additionally , he studied wild foxes and interviewed trappers , hunters , game wardens , and " Masters of Hounds " to learn what they felt foxes would and would not do . In the novel 's postscript , Mannix discusses this research . To defend his novel against charges of improbability , he recounts his observations of wild foxes and discusses other people 's stories about fox behavior . Regarding the actions Tod takes in eluding the hunters , he details both witnessing wild foxes performing such acts and stories others shared with him that he used as a basis for some of the story 's events . For example , he notes that while people have told him that foxes do not really run among sheep or cattle herds to escape hounds , he himself used to watch them do just that from his bedroom window . In the case of a fox running along train tracks as a train is approaching , Mannix drew on a story told to him by a master of hunting in the area of Whitford Sales — near <unk> , Pennsylvania — who had to stop hunting in the area because of a fox who consistently killed pursuing hounds on the Trenton Cutoff using this method . 
 Mannix felt it was nearly impossible for any writer to escape imparting some anthropomorphism in such a novel , as a human must guess at the way an animal 's mind may work and what motivations it may have . He felt animals think differently from humans , though are capable of reason on a " rudimentary level compared to a human . " In explaining his descriptions of hunting , he said it was hard to decide how a hound with non @-@ human scenting ability interprets and responds to scents while tracking another animal . 
 The last chapter of the novel , covering Copper 's last hunt of Tod , was based on the story of Boston , a fourteen @-@ month @-@ old bloodhound – foxhound mix , and Old Baldy , a red fox known by hunters for having outrun numerous packs of hounds put on his trail . Mannix originally read the story in a Recreation magazine article , which stated that in December 1887 , near the James River in Virginia , Boston hunted a fox referred to as Baldy for a day and a half , covering 50 miles ( 80 km ) of terrain . According to Mannix , Boston and Baldy died together , and were buried together once found . In the Recreation article , although Boston survived he never fully recovered and died when he was only three years old . Copper himself was based on the favorite hunting dog of Bee Dee Adkins , a nationally renowned trainer of hunting dogs with whom Mannix hunted . Some of the novel 's human characters were based on the lives and mannerisms on locals living in Oro Valley , a suburb of Tucson , Arizona . 
 In 1967 , E. P. Dutton selected Mannix 's unpublished novel as the 1967 winner of its annual " Animal Book Award " — an international competition open to new authors in which an editorial panel evaluates submissions to find the " best book @-@ length work of adult fiction or nonfiction on animals " . Along with a cash prize of $ 10 @,@ 000 , the company obtained the publication rights for the novel , releasing it in hardback form on September 11 that year . The novel was published in the United States by Dutton and in Canada by Clarke , Irwin and Company , simultaneously . A reprint by Pocket Books followed in 1971 . The novel has been released in twelve other countries , including Finland in 1968 by <unk> , and in Germany by Hoffmann und <unk> .

 The Fox and the Hound was selected as a Reader 's Digest Book Club selection in 1967 and an abridged version was printed in the fourth volume of the publisher 's Condensed Books series . The same year , it was awarded the Athenaeum Literary Award . 
 The Booklist called the novel one of " the highest level of books about animals " and praised its combination of " brilliant psychology , writing of rare beauty , and little @-@ known hunting and animal lore " . According to the Booklist , Publishers Weekly gave the novel its " highest recommendation " and referred to it as a " marvelous evocation of the animal world " . Reviewing the novel for Best Sellers magazine , William B. Hill considered it a " corking good novel " , praising it for its " simplicity and straightforwardness " with the dog and fox being " real " rather than allegories for social issues . While he felt the novel was overly detailed in a few places , as a whole he considered the story " credible , almost all fascinating " and the characters entertaining . 
 Robert Ramsey of the Placerville , California , Mountain Democrat thought the book worthy of winning the Dutton award , characterizing the narrative as " always interesting " and principal characters Tod and Copper as " unforgettable " , while praising Mannix 's " ability to enter into the world of animals and portray it " . A reviewer for the Catholic Library World considered it an " memorable and delightful reading experience " written by a man " who knows the ways of foxes " . Author and sportsman Richard Alden Knight praised the novel , stating that it " surpasses any writing I have ever encountered on the thinking processes of animals " and that the story of a duel between natural enemies is " told well and written with feeling " . A reviewer for the Reading Eagle felt Mannix wrote well enough to make a reader feel like they were the characters Tod and Copper and that the story was " really exciting " due to the " dramatic opposition " of the two animals .

 Walt Disney Pictures purchased the film rights to The Fox and the Hound when it was awarded the Dutton Animal Book Award . Production on a film adaptation began in 1977 and it would become the most expensive animated film produced at the time , at a cost of $ 12 million . To craft the film , then Disney CEO Ron Miller decided to mainly use new talent to make their debuts with the film , as the pioneers of the company , referred to as the " Nine Old Men " , were nearing retirement . The animators and screenplay writers were primarily new , as were the film directors Art Stevens , Ted Berman , and Richard Rich . It would be the last film Ollie Johnston , Frank Thomas , and Woolie Reitherman , considered " legends " of Disney , would work on . However , the transition between the old guard and the new resulted in arguments over how to handle the film . Reitherman had his own ideas on the designs and layouts that should be used ; however , the newer team backed Stevens , except Don Bluth , who felt Disney 's work was stale . Bluth walked out , taking eleven others with him , and formed his own animation studio . The exodus of the animators forced the cancellation of the film 's original Christmas 1980 premiere while new artists were hired . 
 Along the way , the story was greatly modified to make it more suitable as a family film . By the time it was completed in 1981 , the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures , who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses . In the original screenplay , Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel , but Stevens did not want to have an on @-@ screen death and modified the film so that he survived . 
 The film premiered theatrically in the United States on July 10 , 1981 . It was an immediate success , grossing $ 39 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 to become the 14th top film of the year . It was subsequently re @-@ released theatrically on March 25 , 1988 , and saw its first home video release on March 1 , 1994 .

 " Make Room for Lisa " was written by Brian Scully and was the first full episode Matthew Nastuk directed for The Simpsons . Nastuk had previously received a credit for " D 'oh @-@ in In the Wind " , which he directed one scene for . " Make Room for Lisa " was also the second episode about Homer and Lisa that Scully wrote for the series , the first one being " Lost Our Lisa " from the previous season . " Make Room for Lisa " was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February 28 , 1999 . When writing the episode , the Simpsons writing staff debated what to do with Lisa after her room had been rebuilt . Brian Scully eventually pitched that Lisa and Bart would have to share a room together , as it would , according to staff writer Matt Selman , comment on the feeling of having to share a room with a sibling , and how it would " incredibly suck . " The writers then wrote the episode around that plot point . 
 Near the beginning of the episode , Homer takes part in , and wins , KBBL 's drinking contest . In the next scene , Homer is seen fallen out of his car , and waken up by Marge . The scene was inspired by Scully 's brother Mike Scully , who , during a date , saw his date 's father " drunk and passed out " on her lawn , in the same pose as Homer in the scene . The episode 's subplot revolves around Marge , who listens to phone calls by picking up their frequencies with a baby monitor . The storyline was based on former Simpsons showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein , who also used to pick up listen to other people 's phone calls through <unk> signals . At one point in the episode , Marge overhears a conversation between Moe Szyslak and Lenny Leonard . Originally , the conversation would be between two women , but the writers thought it would be " too cliche " to show women gossiping , and changed it to Moe and Lenny instead . While inside the isolation tank , Homer gets bored and starts singing " Witch Doctor " by Armenian @-@ American singer David Seville . According to Mike Scully , the Simpsons staff had to pay the song 's record company $ 100 000 for the rights to use the tune in the episode . The episode features a " prototype " of what would become the recurring character Lindsey Naegle , who is voiced by American actress Tress MacNeille . 
 = = Themes and cultural references = = 
 Throughout the series , Homer and Lisa 's relationship is problematic , as Homer often struggles to understand Lisa , who in many ways is a little girl but who is also smarter than him . Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analyzed " Make Room for Lisa " in their book The Simpsons in the classroom : <unk> the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield . They wrote that in the episode , Homer and Lisa 's relationship is badly damaged after Homer allows Lisa 's room to be turned into a cell phone tower . When the two enter sensory @-@ deprivation tanks , Lisa has several hallucinations , including one in which she becomes Homer . This experience shows Lisa how she appears from Homer 's point of view , and makes her realize that her treatment of Homer is hurtful , as he often participates in activities with her that he does not enjoy . The episode ends with Homer and Lisa watching a demolition derby , which Lisa enjoys because she is spending time with Homer . The episode advises children to be accepting of their parents , who " do the best [ they ] can " to raise them . 
 The American sitcom All in the Family has provided much influence for the comedy in The Simpsons , as John Alberti writes in his book Leaving Springfield : the Simpsons and the possibility of oppositional culture . He wrote that the series influence on The Simpsons is " acknowledged quite openly in the program itself , " and used a scene in " Make Room for Lisa " as an example . The scene shows Homer , Bart and Lisa visiting the Smithsonian Exhibition , where a jacket worn by Fonzie , a character from another 70 's series , Happy Days , receives more attention from visitors than the Bill of Rights . It does however catch the attention of Homer , who picks it up and reads it while sitting in a wing chair owned by Archie Bunker , a character from All in the Family . Homer is accosted by two security guards , who assault him using , according to Alberti , " the kind of language we have learned to accept from the erstwhile occupant of that chair [ Bunker ] . " Homer and the two guards have the following exchange : 
 Alberti opines that , rather than denying All in the Family 's influence on The Simpsons , the series writers " mockingly embrace [ s ] it " by having Homer visually likened to Bunker as he sits on his chair . Alberti also noted that one of the security officer 's use of the word " pinko " , a term used for a person who is regarded as sympathetic towards communism , is " ironic " as it was used by Bunker , whose chair Homer is sitting in . When the other officer complaints about citizens " hiding behind the Bill of Rights " , Homer shields himself from the officers blows with the actual manuscript , making the officer 's previous statement literal .

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide described the episode as having " two distinct halves , although the second far outweighs the first . " They added that Homer 's adventure in the sensory deprivation tank was " inspired , " in its " almost Keystone Kop humour as he gets from point A to point B and so on , finally getting back to point A none the wiser . " They concluded their review by calling the episode " classic . " Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a mixed review , and described its main plot as " feeling a bit stale . " He felt that there were already several episodes dedicated to Homer and Lisa 's problematic relationship , and that " Make Room for Lisa " " doesn 't do much to expand that theme . " However , he described the episode 's subplot as " interesting , " and wrote " Marge 's fascination with intercepted cell phone calls amuses . " He concluded his review by describing the episode as " pretty average . " DVD Town 's James Plath gave the episode a mixed review as well , calling it " okay .

The Cubs traded Evers to the Braves in 1914 ; that season , Evers led the Braves to victory in the World Series , and was named the league 's Most Valuable Player . Evers continued to play for the Braves and Phillies through 1917 . He then became a coach , scout , manager , and general manager in his later career . 
 Known as one of the smartest ballplayers in MLB , Evers also had a surly temper that he took out on umpires . Evers was a part of a great double @-@ play combination with Joe Tinker and Frank Chance , which was immortalized as " Tinker @-@ to @-@ Evers @-@ to @-@ Chance " in the poem " Baseball 's Sad Lexicon " . Evers was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1946 .

 Evers batted .285 and led the New York State League with 10 home runs . Frank Selee , manager of the Chicago Cubs , scouted Evers 's teammate , pitcher Alex Hardy . Selee , also looking for a second baseman due to an injury to starter Bobby Lowe , purchased Hardy 's and Evers 's contracts for $ 1 @,@ 500 ( $ 41 @,@ 025 in current dollar terms ) ; the Trojans were willing to sell Evers 's services due to his temper and many errors made in the field . 
 = = = Chicago Cubs = = = 
 Evers made his MLB debut with the Cubs on September 1 at shortstop , as Selee moved Joe Tinker from shortstop to third base . Only three players in the National League ( NL ) were younger than Evers : Jim St. Vrain , Jimmy Sebring , and Lave <unk> . Three days later , Selee returned Tinker to shortstop and assigned Evers to second base . In his month @-@ long tryout with the Cubs , Evers batted .222 without recording an extra @-@ base hit and played inconsistent defense . However , Lowe 's injury did not properly heal by spring training in 1903 , allowing Evers to win the starting job for the 1903 season . Lowe recovered during the 1903 season , but Evers ' strong play made Lowe expendable ; Evers finished third in the NL in fielding percentage among second basemen ( .937 ) , and finished fifth in assists ( 245 ) and putouts ( 306 ) . The Cubs sold Lowe to the Pittsburgh Pirates after the season . Evers played 152 games in the 1904 season . Defensively , his 518 assists and 381 putouts led the NL , though his 54 errors led all NL second basemen . 
 During the 1906 season , Evers finished fifth in the NL with 49 stolen bases , and led the league with 344 putouts and led all second basemen with 44 errors . The Cubs won the NL pennant in 1906 , but lost the 1906 World Series to the Chicago White Sox four games to two ; Evers batted 3 @-@ for @-@ 20 ( .150 ) in the series .

 During the 1908 pennant race , Evers alerted the umpires to Fred Merkle 's baserunning error in a game against the New York Giants , which became known as " Merkle 's Boner " . Al Bridwell hit what appeared to be the game @-@ winning single for the Giants , while Merkle , the baserunner on first base , went to the clubhouse without touching second base . Evers called for the ball , and the umpire ruled Merkle out . NL president Harry Pulliam ruled the game a tie , with a makeup to be played . The Cubs won the makeup game , thereby winning the pennant . The Cubs then won the 1908 World Series over Detroit , four games to one , as Evers again batted 7 @-@ for @-@ 20 ( .350 ) .

Without Evers , the Cubs won the NL pennant , but lost the 1910 World Series to the Philadelphia Athletics , four games to one . Evers agreed to manage the Navy Midshipmen , a college baseball team , in 1911 , despite the opposition of Cubs ' manager Frank Chance . He experienced a nervous breakdown in 1911 ; returning to the Cubs later in the season , he played in only 46 games that year . Evers indicated that this was a result of a business deal that cost Evers most of his savings . Evers rebounded to bat .341 in 1912 , good for fourth in the NL , and he led the NL with a .431 on @-@ base percentage . Team owner Charles W. Murphy named Evers manager in 1913 , signing him to a five @-@ year contract , succeeding Chance .

 After the 1913 season , Evers was offered $ 100 @,@ 000 ( $ 2 @,@ 394 @,@ 276 in current dollar terms ) to jump to the Federal League , but he opted to take less money to remain with the Cubs . In February 1914 , after Evers signed his players to contracts , Murphy fired Evers as manager and traded him to the Boston Braves for Bill Sweeney and Hub Perdue . Murphy insisted that Evers had resigned as manager , which Evers denied . Evers insisted he was a free agent , but the league assigned him to the Braves . He signed a four @-@ year contract at $ 10 @,@ 000 per season ( $ 236 @,@ 246 in current dollar terms ) , with a $ 20 @,@ 000 signing bonus . 
 During the 1914 season , the Braves fell into last place of the eight @-@ team NL by July 4 .

However , Evers suffered from appendicitis during the season , missing time during the year , and the White Sox opened up a managerial search when Chance died in September . The White Sox replaced Evers with Collins after the season . 
 Evers rejoined the Braves as a scout . As Braves owner Emil Fuchs sold manager Rogers Hornsby to the Cubs and assumed managerial duties himself for the 1929 season , Fuchs hired Evers as a coach . Fuchs had no experience as a field manager , and so Evers became captain of the Braves , directing the team during the game and dealing with umpires .

In the process , Evers became the oldest player in the league for the year . 
 Evers remained a coach for the Braves under Bill McKechnie , who succeeded Fuchs as field manager in 1930 , and served in the role through 1932 .

 Evers served as the pivot man in the " Tinker @-@ to @-@ Evers @-@ to @-@ Chance " double @-@ play combination , which inspired the classic baseball poem " Baseball 's Sad Lexicon " , written by New York Evening Mail newspaper columnist Franklin Pierce Adams in July 1910 . Evers , Tinker , and Chance were all inducted in the Hall of Fame in the same year . 
 The Merkle play remains one of the most famous in baseball history .

 = = Plot = = 
 Kyle , Cartman , Stan , and Kenny enjoy a nice day outside with the weather being warm until a large group of Harley riders disturb them . The residents of South Park are frustrated by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town . The Harley riders eat lunch and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them , so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone 's attention . Before the Harley riders take off , Cartman confronts the bikers , describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves . Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like " fags " and , when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur , the bikers assume they are being insulted because they are not being loud enough . They believe that they should be louder because after all , children are around loud stuff today ( such as the Xbox 360 and Surround sound system ) . The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns , sirens and various musical instruments . The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers . However , once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles , he is not allowed to participate in the scheme . As the riders eat at a diner , Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint " <unk> GET OUT " on several buildings around town . The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town , but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia . 
 The boys readily admit to the spray painting , and explain to the city council that the word " fag " is not intended as an insult to homosexuals , and is being used only in reference to a contemptible person who rides a Harley motorcycle , or " an inconsiderate douchebag " , as Stan puts it . They call upon the council to formally recognize this new usage . Support from the town , including the local gay community , results in a town ordinance declaring a change in the word 's definition . This action leads to negative publicity from the rest of the nation , and further angers the displaced bikers who refuse to be labeled as " fags " ( one rider even assaulted a news reporter for calling him fag to his face three times ) . They look up the word in the dictionary and learn its definition has adapted over the years : it previously meant " an unpleasant old woman " and a bundle of sticks . 
 Upset by the national attention , Mayor McDaniels wants to resolve the situation , and the boys suggest getting the official dictionary definition updated . The town invites the English Dictionary <unk> , led by the head editor , former child actor Emmanuel Lewis , to review the proposal and consider making the definition change official . As the town celebrates the arrival of Lewis and the <unk> , the bikers suddenly crash the event and begin to riot . After inflicting damage to the town and scaring off the citizens , they corner the boys in an alley . The bikers demand they stop being called " fags " , but the boys refuse to do so , asserting their behavior further justifies the application of the term . Butters steps between them and comes to the defense of the riders by expressing his admiration for the Harley @-@ Davidson lifestyle . Confronted by gun @-@ wielding residents led by Big Gay Al , the riders ultimately accept their new label , and Lewis ( who was roughed up during the riot ) is happy to declare the definition officially changed . The town rejoices and celebrates , and the episode cuts to an ending title card with an updated definition : 
 Fag ( <unk> ) n . 
 1 . An extremely annoying , inconsiderate person most commonly associated with Harley riders . 
 2 . A loud and obnoxious person who owns or frequently rides a Harley .

 " The F Word " advocates a philosophy that language is malleable and ever @-@ changing , and that the idea of taboo words are only assigned their stigma because society allows them to become so . The word " fag " is used casually and extremely frequently by the characters throughout the episode , and Comedy Central agreed not to censor the word . The characters use the word " fag " very frequently throughout the episode as an attempt to insult the Harley bikers . 
 Although LGBT activists acknowledged the noble intentions behind the episode , the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation objected to " The F Word " , stating the episode still uses the word in a very derogatory context , even though it is directed against bikers instead of homosexuals . As a result , GLAAD said " The F Word " still reinforced the usage of the word " fag " as a means of insulting others , and could be unintentionally harmful to the gay community . GLAAD officials called it a " slur @-@ filled episode " and demanded an apology from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone . Comedy Central declined to respond to the comments .

 " The F Word " makes prominent use of Harley @-@ Davidson , the largest motorcycle manufacturing company in the United States .

 " The F Word " was considered particularly controversial , even by South Park standards due to the excessive use of the word " fag " . The episode received generally mixed reviews . Carlos Delgado of iF magazine said " The F Word " marks a return of South Park 's tradition of tackling sensitive social issues with intelligent and politically incorrect writing , which Delgado said had been lacking in recent episodes . Delgado said " The F Word " served as a reminder that society is always changing and that although the thoughts or intentions behind words are harmful , the word itself is not . Ramsey Isler of IGN compared " The F Word " to " With Apologies to Jesse Jackson " , an eleventh season episode that contained frequent use of the racial slur " nigger " . However , Isler said " The F Word " was not as skillfully crafted as the " Jesse Jackson " episode and , although some moments were entertaining , the episode " had a habit of running some gags into the ground " . James Hibberd , of The Live Feed , said he found the episode " well @-@ intended and funny " , and that it forced viewers to face a difficult issue and reexamine their beliefs about it . Hibberd wrote , " This is also , by the way , precisely what great art does " . Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club said the word " fag " has not lost its associations with homosexuals , so she did not believe in the episode 's statements about the changing use of the word . Koski also called the episode " preachy " , and said , " It took too long to get going , seemed confused about what its point was , and , most egregiously , had very few laughs . "

 = Old Kent Road = 
 Old Kent Road is a major thoroughfare in South East London , England , passing through the London Borough of Southwark . It was originally part of an ancient trackway that was paved by the Romans and used by the Anglo @-@ Saxons who named it Wæcelinga Stræt ( Watling Street ) . It is now part of the A2 , a major road from London to Dover . The road was important in Roman times linking London to the coast at Richborough and Dover via Canterbury . It was a route for pilgrims in the Middle Ages as portrayed in Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales , when Old Kent Road was known as Kent Street . The route was used by soldiers returning from the Battle of Agincourt . 
 In the 16th century , St Thomas @-@ a @-@ Watering on Old Kent Road was a place where religious dissenters and those found guilty of treason were publicly hanged . The road was rural in nature and several coaching inns were built alongside it . In the 19th century it acquired the name Old Kent Road and several industrial premises were set up to close to the Surrey Canal and a major business , the Metropolitan Gas Works was developed . In the 20th century , older property was demolished for redevelopment and Burgess Park was created . The Old Kent Road Baths opened around 1905 had Turkish and Russian bath facilities . In the 21st century , several retail parks and premises typical of out @-@ of @-@ town development have been built beside it while public houses have been redeveloped for other purposes . 
 The road is celebrated in the music hall song " Knocked ' em in the Old Kent Road " , describing working @-@ class London life . It is the first property , and one of the two cheapest , on the London Monopoly board and the only one in South London . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The road begins at the Bricklayers ' Arms roundabout , where it meets the New Kent Road , Tower Bridge Road , and Great Dover Street . It runs southeast past Burgess Park , Christ Church , Peckham and the railway line from Peckham Rye to South Bermondsey . 
 Just east of the railway bridge , the road crosses the boundary between the London boroughs of Southwark and Lewisham , where the road ahead becomes New Cross Road . The road appears on a map to form a boundary between Walworth , and Peckham to the south and Bermondsey to the north although the Bermondsey boundary runs along Rolls Road . 
 = = History = = 
 Old Kent Road , one of the oldest roads in England , was part of a Celtic ancient trackway that was paved by the Romans and recorded as Inter III on the Antonine Itinerary . The Anglo @-@ Saxons named it " Wæcelinga Stræt " ( Watling Street ) . It joined Stane Street another ancient and Roman road at Southwark before crossing the Thames at London Bridge . The Inter III was one of the most important Roman roads in Britain , linking London with Canterbury and the Channel ports at Richborough ( Rutupiae ) ; Dover ( <unk> ) and Lympne ( <unk> ) . Pilgrims , as documented in Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales , travelled along the road from London and Southwark on their way to Canterbury . In 1415 , the road was a scene of celebrations for soldiers returning from the Battle of Agincourt heading towards London . The Kentish Drovers public house opened in 1840 and was so named because the road was a thoroughfare for market traffic . The road was mainly rural in nature , surrounded by fields and windmills and the occasional tavern until the 19th century . John Rocque 's Map of London , published in 1746 , shows hedgerows along its course . The name Old Kent Road came into use at this time ; up to then the road from Borough High Street to the Bricklayers Arms junction was known as Kent Street , this section was renamed Tabard Street in the 1890s . 
 = = = St Thomas @-@ a @-@ Watering = = = 
 The bridge at St Thomas @-@ a @-@ Watering over the River <unk> was at the junction with what is now Old Kent Road and Shorncliffe Road ( previously Thomas Street ) , and marked the boundary of the Archbishop of Canterbury 's authority over the manors of Southwark and Walworth . It was the limit of the City of London 's authority in 1550 , having been ratified in several charters and marked by a boundary stone set into the wall of the old fire station that marked the first resting place for pilgrims while travelling to Canterbury . The nearby public house , the Thomas a Becket , at the corner of Albany Road is named after this . Henry V met soldiers returning from Agincourt at this location in 1415 . Charles II 's journey along the road on his way to reclaim the throne in May 1660 was described by contemporary writer and diarist John Evelyn as " a triumph of about 20 @,@ 000 horse and <unk> , brandishing their swords and shouting with inexpressible joy " . 
 St Thomas @-@ a @-@ Watering became a place of execution for criminals whose bodies were left hanging from the gibbets on the principal route from the southeast to London . On 8 July 1539 , Griffith Clerke , Vicar of Wandsworth was hanged and quartered here along with his chaplain and two others , for not acknowledging the royal supremacy of Henry VIII . The Welsh Protestant martyr John Penry was also executed here on 6 April 1593 ; a small side street nearby is named after him . The Catholic martyrs John Jones and John Rigby were executed in 1598 and 1600 respectively . 
 = = = Rolls family = = = 
 In the early @-@ 18th century , the Rolls family of The Grange in nearby Bermondsey acquired a significant amount of land around Old Kent Road . It included residential development that is now Surrey Square and the Paragon , which were designed by Michael Searles in 1788 . The main road route gave rise to ribbon development because of the increasing urbanisation of the expanding metropolitan area . In the early @-@ 20th century , social housing was built on land previously held by the family who gave away their interests for public benefit including the library at Wells Way in Burgess Park , the girls grammar school at Bricklayers Arms ( St Saviour 's and St Olave 's School ) and the Peabody Estate ( Dover Flats and Waleran Flats ) . The last significant remnant of their involvement is the detached White House between the Peabody Estate buildings , built by Searles in the 1790s . The original railings and ironwork survive in the current development at No. 155 . The house was later occupied by Searles and became the management office of the Rolls family trust estates . The last of the male Rolls 's was the Hon Charles Stewart Rolls who was the pioneer motorist and aviator who formed the Rolls @-@ Royce partnership with Henry Royce . 
 = = = Industrial development = = = 
 The opening of the Surrey Canal in 1811 changed the character of the road from rural to industrial . <unk> were established along it and a soap processing plant was built . Older properties occupied by the upper and middle classes were converted into flats for the emerging working class population . By the time Bricklayers Arms goods station opened in 1845 , the road was entirely built up and Old Kent Road had one of the highest population densities in Europe , with an average of 280 residents per acre . Sections along the road were commercial with various market stalls and sellers until the construction of the tramway in 1871 . Camberwell Public Library No. 1 , which later became the Livesey Museum for Children was designed by Sir George Livesey in 1890 . The road 's southern section remained residential throughout the 19th century . Nos. 864 , 866 and 880 – 884 were constructed by John Lamb in 1815 , and feature Ammonite capitals , ornamental features resembling fossils , a feature also used in contemporary architecture in Brighton . 
 The Licensed Victuallers ' National Asylum ( now Caroline Gardens ) , an extensive almshouse estate off Old Kent Road at Asylum Road , opened in 1827 . Its first patron was Prince Augustus Frederick , Duke of Sussex who was followed by Prince Albert and Prince Edward . 
 The Metropolitan Gas Works , identifiable by its large gasometers , was founded in 1833 . It serviced an area of more than 13 square miles ( 34 km2 ) , including parts of Southwark , Croydon , Newington , Lambeth and Streatham . Expansion of the gas works in 1868 required the demolition of Christ Church , Camberwell which was built in 1838 and rebuilt on the opposite side of the road by Livesey . The gas works was managed by Livesey from 1840 until his death in 1908 . A statue of him was sited in the rear courtyard of Livesey Museum , opposite the works . 
 During the 19th and 20th century , the industrial and working class makeup of Old Kent Road made it a haven for organised crime and violence . The notorious Richardson Gang operated in the area , and boxing clubs became popular . Lennox Lewis ' manager Frank Maloney grew up in the area and recalled , " If you weren 't into crime , people thought you were a pansy " . Draining the Surrey Canal in 1971 uncovered a number of cracked and blown safes that had been thrown in the water .

 Old Kent Road railway station at the southern end of the road opened in 1866 and closed in 1917 . The London City Fire Brigade opened a fire station on the road around 1868 . It was subsumed into the London Fire Brigade from its formation and in 1904 was replaced by a new station which was in turn replaced by another on the corner of Coopers Road . The station was demolished for redevelopment in 2014 and reopened the following year . 
 The Old Kent Road Baths were built in 1906 . According to Modern Sanitation , they were the only public baths in London with Turkish bath facilities at the time . The baths were designed to include two swimming pools , each measuring 75 feet ( 23 m ) by 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) . In 1913 @-@ 4 , the baths were used by 188 @,@ 336 private bathers , 14 @,@ 687 of which used its Russian , Turkish , or special electric baths .

 Unlike many places in London , the Old Kent Road area did not suffer significant bomb damage during World War II . In 1968 , a flyover opened at the northern end allowing access to New Kent Road which catered for the main flow of traffic . During the 1970s , run @-@ down Victorian properties on and around Old Kent Road were demolished to make way for new housing estates . Burgess Park was created as part of the County of London Plan in 1943 , which recommended new parkland in the area . Several tower blocks were built along the road , although some earlier 19th @-@ century buildings , such as Nos. 360 – 386 , survived . 
 Public houses on Old Kent Road have been closing since the 1980s . At one point , there were 39 pubs . The Dun Cow at No. 279 opened in 1856 and was well known as a gin palace , and later became a champagne bar and featured DJs such as Steve Walsh and Robbie Vincent . The premises closed in 2004 to become a surgery . The World Turned Upside Down had been on the Old Kent Road since the 17th century , and may have been named after the discovery of Australia , Van Diemen 's Land , or Tierra del Fuego in South America . The pub became a music venue in the 20th century and is where Long John <unk> gave his first live performance in 1958 . It closed in 2009 and is now a branch of Domino 's Pizza . The Duke of Kent was converted into a mosque in 1999 ; in 2011 the mosque was planned to move to the former site of the Old Kent Road swimming baths . The Livesey Museum for Children closed in 2008 owing to council budget cuts and is now used for short term accommodation . 
 Southwark Borough Council do not consider Old Kent Road to fit the characteristics of an urban town centre , and consequently large retail parks more in character with out @-@ of @-@ town schemes have been developed including a large Asda superstore , B & Q store , Halfords , Magnet and PC World .

 Old Kent Road is the first property square on the British Monopoly board , priced at £ 60 and forming the brown set along with the similarly working class Whitechapel Road . It is the only square on the board in South London and south of the Thames . 
 The road makes several appearances in literature . In Charles Dickens ' David Copperfield , the titular character runs down the road trying to escape from London to Dover , though in the narrative the street is still partly rural in nature . After suffering an attack of amnesia , the main character of George Orwell 's A Clergyman 's Daughter , Dorothy Hare , finds herself alone on Old Kent Road . In 1985 , the BBC arts series Arena included a documentary about the road . 
 The road is mentioned in the title of the music hall song " Knocked ' em in the Old Kent Road " . It was written in 1891 by Albert Chevalier , who was the lyricist and original performer ; the music was written by his brother Charles Ingle . The song was popularised by Shirley Temple 's performance in the 1939 film A Little Princess The street is mentioned multiple times in the Madness song " Calling Cards " , a song about running an illegitimate business " in a sorting office in the Old Kent Road " . It is featured in the chorus of the Levellers ' song " Cardboard Box City " , which criticises the slow action on helping the homeless in London , specifically Old Kent Road being infrequently visited by the wealthy due to its being south of the Thames .

His mother , Zahra ' is the grand daughter of the renovator Shia khatib Mulla Atiya al @-@ Jamri . They were married in Bahrain in 1957 . Abdul Amir was 20 and Zahra ' , his cousin 's grand daughter was 16 . 
 Few months after his birth , al @-@ Jamri family traveled to Najaf , Iraq where his father continued his religious studies . At the time , al @-@ Jamri 's family was composed of his parents and his 2 @-@ year @-@ old brother Mohammed Jameel . He studied for five years at the <unk> primary school which was also attended by some Bahrainis such as Sami , the elder son of Isa Qassim . Having no TV at home , al @-@ Jamri and his siblings spent most of their time listening to stories told by their mother or playing with kites outside . At the age of 9 , he began practicing Islamic prayers and fasting in Ramadan . 
 In his book Non @-@ scattered memories of Najaf , al @-@ Jamri describes the dire situation in Iraq following the rise of Ba 'ath party in 1968 . He writes that the " biggest tragedy " he witnessed was the deportation of Iraqis of Iranian origins , some of whom were his neighbors . Al @-@ Jamri and his school colleagues were often forced to take part in pro and anti @-@ Ba 'athist protests . 
 Al @-@ Jamri 's first memories in Bahrain were during a visit with father during the month of Ramadan . Although he was mocked by other kids due to his partly Iraqi accent , al @-@ Jamri said he was very happy with the visit as he found his village Bani Jamra much more " open " than Najaf . In 1973 , al @-@ Jamri returned to Bahrain with his family , spending 11 years of his life in Iraq . He said his father 's decision to return to Bahrain was the " best news I have ever received " and that to him Bahrain represented " freedom and eternal joy " . 
 In 1978 , al @-@ Jamri graduated from high school , technical sector . In 1979 , he traveled to the United Kingdom to continue his higher education after receiving a scholarship from Ministry of Education . He studied mechanical engineering at the University of the West of Scotland ( Paisley University ) of which he holds the doctorate degree . Trouble followed al @-@ Jamri during his visits to Bahrain as he was questioned by security forces in 1980 , his passport withdrawn for a year in 1982 and in 1987 he was not able to find a job . In 1987 , al @-@ Jamri immigrated to Britain which he held its citizenship . He lived in self @-@ imposed exile for 14 years during which he continued his studies and became the spokesman of the opposition group Bahrain Freedom Movement . He was also a " frequent guest on international news outlets such as the BBC . " 
 Al @-@ Jamri is married to Reem Khalifa , a columnist and reporter working for Al @-@ Wasat and the Associated Press . Unlike Mansoor , she follows the Sunni branch of Islam . She was described by the New York Times as a " woman of Western tastes " . Khalifa comes from a leftist family .

 Three days later , the facility was attacked at 1am by a club @-@ wielding @-@ gang that " attack [ ed ] the touch screens and computers of the printing machine , " said the head of Al @-@ Wasat printing press . That day Al @-@ Wasat was printed by another newspaper . Employees had to work from home as " hundreds of vigilantes encircled the area " , they ( employees ) were harassed in checkpoints and authorities reportedly failed to protect them even after getting contacted . Al @-@ Jamri reported receiving death threats via phone and getting intimidated by government informers .

 On 2 April , following a three @-@ hour episode on Bahrain TV alleging it had published false and fabricated news and images in its 26 and 29 March editions , Al @-@ Wasat was forced to close down and had its website blocked by the Information Affairs Authority ( IAA ) . The state @-@ run Bahrain News Agency accused it of " unethical " media coverage of the events of the uprising and the IAA released a 30 @-@ page report " detailing Al Wasat 's alleged transgressions " . The news and images turned out to be either from other countries or from previous events . The newspaper did not publish an edition on 3 April . Al @-@ Jamri acknowledged that the reports identified in Bahrain TV show were false , but said he and his staff did not " knowingly [ publish ] false information " . 
 The ban was lifted a day later after al @-@ Jamri and two other top editors had resigned . Al @-@ Jamri said his resignation was " needed to safeguard the newspaper and the livelihood of its staff . " On 4 April , Al @-@ Wasat resumed publishing under the supervision of two Iraqi editors . The two temporary editors were questioned in the National Security Agency and were deported along with their families after they had refused to confess against al @-@ Jamri . Al @-@ Jamri and the two editors who resigned were subsequently questioned and charged with " publishing fabricated news and made up stories ... that may harm public safety and national interests .

 Unlike other cases which were brought before a military court , their first trial session on 18 May was before the ( civilian ) High Criminal Court and was postponed to June . Al @-@ Jamri said before a trial session on 19 June that the fabricated news articles were sent to Al @-@ Wasat from a Saudi IP address and that they were not verified properly due to the previous attacks on Al @-@ Wasat .

 = Wario = 
 Wario ( <unk> , Wario , [ w ͍ <unk> ] ) ( English / <unk> / ) is a character in Nintendo 's Mario series who was originally designed as an antagonist to Mario . He first appeared in the 1992 Game Boy title Super Mario Land 2 : 6 Golden Coins as the main antagonist and final boss . His name is a portmanteau of Mario 's name and the Japanese word <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " bad " . Wario was first designed by Hiroji Kiyotake , and is voiced by Charles Martinet , who also voices many other characters in the series . 
 Since his debut , Wario has become the protagonist and antihero of the Wario Land and WarioWare series , spanning handheld and console markets . In addition to appearances in spin @-@ offs in the Mario series , he appears in cameos for Kirby Super Star Ultra , Densetsu no Stafy 3 and Pilotwings 64 . He has also been featured in other media such as the Super Mario Adventures graphic novel . The character has received a largely positive critical reception and has emerged as a well @-@ established mascot for Nintendo . 
 = = Concept and creation = = 
 A possible inspiration for Wario first appeared in the 1985 game Wrecking Crew in the character of Spike , a construction foreman . Although he bears a slight resemblance to Spike , Wario did not debut until 1992 . The first named appearance of the character occurred in the game Super Mario Land 2 : 6 Golden Coins . He was designed by game artist Hiroji Kiyotake . Wario 's design arose from Super Mario Land 's design team 's distaste of making a game based around someone else 's character . The creation of Wario allowed them a character of their own to " symbolize their situation " . 
 Wario is portrayed as a caricature of Mario ; he has huge , muscular arms , short stubby legs , a large , <unk> , zig @-@ zagging moustache , and a bellicose cackle . He also wears a plumber outfit with a yellow and purple color scheme . The name " Wario " is a portmanteau of " Mario " with the Japanese adjective <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " bad " ; hence , a " bad Mario " ( further symbolized by the " W " on his hat , an upside down " M " ) . Official Nintendo lore states that Wario was a childhood rival to Mario and Luigi who became jealous of their success . Voice actor Charles Martinet , who has voiced Mario since 1995 , is also the voice for Wario . During the audition for the part , Martinet was told to speak in a mean and gruff @-@ sounding tone . He described voicing Wario as a looser task than voicing Mario , since Mario 's speaking manner and personality are more free @-@ flowing , rising from the ground and floating into the air , while one of Wario 's cornerstones is jealousy . Starting with Wario Land : Super Mario Land 3 , Wario experiences rejuvenating effects from garlic in a similar manner as Mario is powered up by mushrooms . Wario often uses bombs , as seen in Wario Land : Super Mario Land 3 , Wario Blast and Mario Kart : Double Dash ! ! . The WarioWare series prominently uses bombs as a visual motif to represent the time limit . 
 In video games in which Wario makes a cameo appearance , he is often portrayed as a villain . However , the development team for Wario Land : Shake It ! stated that he was not really a villain , and they did not consider him one during development . They focused on his behavior , which alternates between good and evil . <unk> Ebisu , a producer of The Shake Dimension , considered Wario to be a reckless character , who uses his strength to overwhelm others . Tadanori <unk> , the design director of The Shake Dimension , described Wario as manly , and said he was " so uncool that he ends up being extremely cool " . Because of this , he wanted Wario to act macho rather than silly and requested that the art designers emphasize his masculinity . Wario was chosen as the star of the WarioWare series because the developers felt he was the best character for the franchise because he often acted stupid .

 Wario made his first appearance as a villain in the 1992 Game Boy video game Super Mario Land 2 : 6 Golden Coins , in which he captured Mario 's castle . He also served as a villain in the 1993 Japan @-@ only puzzle game Mario & Wario , in which he drops a bucket on the head of Mario , Princess Peach , or Yoshi . This was followed by the first game in the Wario Land series , Wario Land : Super Mario Land 3 ( 1994 ) , a platform game which marked Wario 's first appearance as a protagonist and introduced his first villains , Captain Syrup and her Brown Sugar Pirates . His next adventure , 1995 's Virtual Boy Wario Land , plays similarly and incorporates the ability to move in and out of the background . A sequel for the Game Boy title , Wario Land II , was released in 1998 ; it featured Captain Syrup 's return as the antagonist . This game also introduces Wario 's invulnerability , allowing him to be burnt or flattened without sustaining damage . In 2000 Wario Land 3 was released to the Game Boy Color as another sequel ; it used the same mechanics and concepts of its predecessor . The following year , the sequel Wario Land 4 debuted on the Game Boy Advance , incorporating Wario 's ability to become burnt or flattened and reintroducing the ability to become damaged from standard attacks . In 2003 , Wario World , the first console Wario platforming title , was released for the Nintendo GameCube ; it featured three @-@ dimensional graphics and gameplay and did not incorporate any major elements from previous platforming titles . Wario : Master of Disguise was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007 . The game introduced touch screen control of Wario and incorporated puzzles into the gameplay . The series ' most recent release , Wario Land : Shake It ! , was released for the Wii in 2008 and reintroduced Captain Syrup . The game uses a hand @-@ drawn animation style , and Wario 's design required more than 2 @,@ 000 frames of animation .

 In 2003 , the Wario franchise introduced a new series of games , the first of which was WarioWare , Inc . : Mega Microgames ! for the Game Boy Advance . The game 's premise involved Wario 's decision to open a game development company to make money , creating short " microgames " instead of full @-@ fledged games . The title 's gameplay focused on playing a collection of microgames in quick succession . Mega Microgames ! was later remade as WarioWare , Inc . : Mega Party Games ! for the GameCube ; it featured the same microgames but lacked a story mode and focused more on multi @-@ player . In 2004 , two sequels were released for the game . The first was the Game Boy Advance title WarioWare : Twisted ! , which used the cartridge 's tilt sensor to allows microgames to be controlled by tilting the handheld left and right . The second was the Nintendo DS release WarioWare : Touched ! , which incorporates the DS 's touch screen and microphone in its gameplay . One of the Wii 's launch games in 2006 was WarioWare : Smooth Moves , which used the Wii Remote 's motion sensing technologies in a variety of ways . The Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi have offered two new releases , 2008 's WarioWare : Snapped ! , which can be downloaded with the DSiWare service and uses the DSi 's built @-@ in front camera in its gameplay , and the 2009 Nintendo DS game WarioWare D.I.Y. , which allows players to create microgames . Game & Wario for the Nintendo Wii U was released on June 23 , 2013 . Although it does not use the WarioWare name , it incorporates gameplay and characters from the WarioWare series . The game also pays tribute to the original Game & Watch games .

" IGN editor Travis Fahs comments that while Wario is not the most likeable character , his strong confidence overshadows his flaws and makes him entertaining . The website later ranked Wario 31st in a list of the " Top 100 Videogame Villains " . In the book A Parent 's Guide to Nintendo Games : A Comprehensive Look at the Systems and the Games , Craig Wessel described Wario as a " sinister twist " on Mario .

 = USS Kearsarge ( BB @-@ 5 ) = 
 USS Kearsarge ( BB @-@ 5 ) , the lead ship of her class of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships , was a United States Navy ship , named after the sloop @-@ of @-@ war Kearsarge . Her keel was laid down by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Virginia , on 30 June 1896 . She was launched on 24 March 1898 , sponsored by the wife of Rear Admiral Herbert Winslow , and commissioned on 20 February 1900 . 
 Between 1903 and 1907 Kearsarge served in the North Atlantic Fleet , and from 1907 to 1909 she sailed as part of the Great White Fleet . In 1909 she was decommissioned for modernization , which was finished in 1911 . In 1915 she served in the Atlantic , and between 1916 and 1919 she served as a training ship . She was converted into a crane ship in 1920 , renamed Crane Ship No. 1 in 1941 , and sold for scrap in 1955 . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Kearsarge @-@ class battleships were designed to be used for coastal defense . They had a displacement of 11 @,@ 540 short tons ( 10 @,@ 470 t ) , an overall length of 375 feet 4 inches ( 114 @.@ 40 m ) , a beam of 72 feet 3 inches ( 22 @.@ 02 m ) and a draft of 23 feet 6 inches ( 7 @.@ 16 m ) . The two 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines and five Scotch boilers , connected to two propeller shafts , produced a total of 11 @,@ 674 indicated horsepower ( 8 @,@ 705 kW ) , and gave a maximum speed of 16 @.@ 816 knots ( 19 @.@ 352 mph ; 31 @.@ 143 km / h ) . Kearsarge was manned by 40 officers and 514 enlisted men , a total of 554 crew . 
 Kearsarge had two double turrets , with two 13 in ( 330 mm ) / 35 caliber guns and two 8 in ( 203 mm ) / 40 caliber guns each , stacked in two levels . The guns and turret armor were designed by the Bureau of Ordnance , while the turret itself was designed by the Bureau of Construction and Repair . This caused the guns to be mounted far back in the turret , making the ports very large . Admiral William Sims claimed that as a result , a shell fired into the port could reach the magazines below , disabling the guns . In addition to these guns , Kearsarge carried fourteen 5 in ( 127 mm ) / 40 caliber guns , twenty 6 @-@ pounder ( 57 mm or 2 @.@ 2 in ) guns , eight 1 @-@ pounder ( 37 mm or 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns , four .30 in ( 7 @.@ 6 mm ) machine guns , and four 18 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) torpedo tubes . Kearsarge had a very low freeboard , which resulted in her guns becoming unusable in bad weather . 
 The ship 's waterline armor belt was 5 – 16 @.@ 5 inches ( 130 – 420 mm ) thick and the main gun turrets were protected by 15 – 17 inches ( 380 – 430 mm ) of armor , while the secondary turrets had 6 – 11 inches ( 150 – 280 mm ) of armor . The barbettes were 12 @.@ 5 – 15 inches ( 320 – 380 mm ) thick , while the conning tower had 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of armor . The armor was made of <unk> steel . 
 Kearsarge carried 16 smaller boats . A 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) steam cutter , with a capacity of 60 men , together with a 33 @-@ foot ( 10 m ) steam cutter , were used for general carrying from and to port , and could tow the other boats if needed . Two 33 @-@ foot launches , each capable of carrying 64 men , were the " working boats " . There were ten 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) boats : four cutters , each with a capacity of 45 men , the Admiral 's barge , two whaleboats ( which served as lifeboats ) , and the Captain 's gig . Four smaller boats completed Kearsarge 's small fleet : two 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) dinghies and two 18 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) catamarans .

 Kearsarge was authorized on 2 March 1895 , the contract for her construction was awarded on 2 January 1896 , and the keel of the vessel was laid down on 30 June 1896 by Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company in Virginia . The total cost was US $ 5 @,@ 043 @,@ 591 @.@ 68 . She was named soon after the American Civil War sloop @-@ of @-@ war Kearsarge sank , and was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named , by act of Congress , in its honor . She was the only US battleship not named after a state . She was christened on 24 March 1898 ( the same day as her sister ship , Kentucky ) by the wife of Captain Herbert Winslow , daughter @-@ in @-@ law of Captain John Ancrum Winslow , the commander of the original Kearsarge . She was commissioned on 20 February 1900 , under the command of Captain William M. Folger .

From there she passed by the west coast of South America , visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso , Chile , Callao , Peru , and Magdalena Bay , Mexico . The fleet reached San Diego on 14 April 1908 and moved on to San Francisco on 6 May . Two months later the warships sailed for Honolulu , Hawaii , and from there to Auckland , New Zealand , arriving 9 August . The fleet made Sydney , Australia , on 20 August , and after a week sailed for Melbourne . 
 Kearsarge departed Albany , Western Australia , on 18 September for ports in the Philippine Islands , Japan , China , and Ceylon before transiting the Suez Canal . The fleet split at Port Said , with Kearsarge leaving on 10 January 1909 for Malta , and arriving in Algiers on 24 January , before reforming with the fleet at Gibraltar on 1 February . She returned to Hampton Roads on 22 February , and was inspected by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt .

 As with most of the Great White Fleet ships , Kearsarge was modernized on her return . She was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 4 September 1909 , and the modernization was completed in 1911 , at a cost of US $ 675 @,@ 000 . The ship received cage masts , new water @-@ tube boilers , and another four 5 @-@ inch guns . The 1 @-@ pounder guns were removed , as were sixteen of the 6 @-@ pounders . She was recommissioned on 23 June 1915 , and operated along the Atlantic coast . On 17 September she left Philadelphia to land a detachment of US Marines at Veracruz , Mexico , remaining there from 28 September 1915 to 5 January 1916 . She then carried the Marines to New Orleans , Louisiana , before joining the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia on 4 February . Until the United States joined World War I , she trained naval militia from Massachusetts and Maine . During the war she was used to train Armed Guard crews and naval engineers during cruises along the Atlantic seaboard .

 Kearsarge was converted into a crane ship , and was given hull classification symbol IX @-@ 16 on 17 July 1920 , but it was changed to AB @-@ 1 on 5 August . Her turrets , superstructure , and armor were removed , and were replaced by a large revolving crane with a lifting capacity of 250 tons ( 230 tonnes ) , as well as 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) blisters , which improved her stability .

 = Battles of Lexington and Concord = 
 The Battles of Lexington and Concord were the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War . The battles were fought on April 19 , 1775 , in Middlesex County , Province of Massachusetts Bay , within the towns of Lexington , Concord , Lincoln , Menotomy ( present @-@ day Arlington ) , and Cambridge , near Boston . The battles marked the outbreak of open armed conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and thirteen of its colonies on the mainland of British America . 
 In late 1774 the Suffolk Resolves were adopted to resist the enforcement of the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party . The colonial assembly responded by forming an illegal Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities . The rebel government exercised effective control of the colony outside of British @-@ controlled Boston . In response , the British government in February 1775 declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion . 
 About 700 British Army regulars in Boston , under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith , were given secret orders to capture and destroy rebel military supplies reportedly stored by the Massachusetts militia at Concord . Through effective intelligence gathering , Patriot colonials had received word weeks before the expedition that their supplies might be at risk and had moved most of them to other locations . They also received details about British plans on the night before the battle and were able to rapidly notify the area militias of the British expedition . 
 The first shots were fired just as the sun was rising at Lexington . The militia were outnumbered and fell back , and the regulars proceeded on to Concord , where they broke apart into companies to search for the supplies . At the North Bridge in Concord , approximately 400 militiamen engaged 100 regulars from three companies of the King 's troops at about 11 : 00 am , resulting in casualties on both sides . The outnumbered regulars fell back from the bridge and rejoined the main body of British forces in Concord . 
 The British forces began their return march to Boston after completing their search for military supplies , and more militiamen continued to arrive from neighboring towns . Gunfire erupted again between the two sides and continued throughout the day as the regulars marched back towards Boston . Upon returning to Lexington , Lt. Col. Smith 's expedition was rescued by reinforcements under Brigadier General Hugh Percy , a future duke of Northumberland known as Earl Percy . The combined force , now of about 1 @,@ 700 men , marched back to Boston under heavy fire in a tactical withdrawal and eventually reached the safety of Charlestown . The accumulated militias blockaded the narrow land accesses to Charlestown and Boston , starting the Siege of Boston . 
 Ralph Waldo Emerson , in his " Concord Hymn " , described the first shot fired by the Patriots at the North Bridge as the " shot heard round the world " . 
 = = Background = = 
 The British Army 's infantry , nicknamed " redcoats " and sometimes " devils " by the colonists , had occupied Boston since 1768 and had been augmented by naval forces and marines to enforce what the colonists called The Intolerable Acts , which had been passed by the British Parliament to punish the Province of Massachusetts Bay for the Boston Tea Party and other acts of defiance . General Thomas Gage , the military governor of Massachusetts and commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the roughly 3 @,@ 000 British military forces garrisoned in Boston , had no control over Massachusetts outside of Boston , where implementation of the Acts had increased tensions between the Patriot Whig majority and the pro @-@ British Tory minority . Gage 's plan was to avoid conflict by removing military supplies from Whig militias using small , secret , and rapid strikes . This struggle for supplies led to one British success and several rebel successes in a series of nearly bloodless conflicts known as the Powder Alarms . Gage considered himself to be a friend of liberty and attempted to separate his duties as Governor of the colony and as General of an occupying force . Edmund Burke described Gage 's conflicted relationship with Massachusetts by saying in Parliament , " An Englishman is the unfittest person on Earth to argue another Englishman into slavery . " 
 The colonists had been forming militias since the 17th century , initially for local defense against Indian attacks . These forces also saw action in the French and Indian War between 1754 and 1763 when they fought alongside British regulars . Under provincial law , all towns were obligated to form militia companies composed of all males 16 years of age and older ( there were exemptions for some categories ) , and to assure that the members were properly armed . The militias were formally under the jurisdiction of the provincial government , but New England militia companies elected their own officers . When Gage effectively dissolved the provincial government under the terms of the Massachusetts Government Act , these existing connections were employed by the colonists under the Massachusetts Provincial Congress for the purpose of resistance to the military threat from Britain .

 We ... find that a part of your Majesty ' s subjects , in the Province of the Massachusetts Bay , have proceeded so far to resist the authority of the supreme Legislature , that a rebellion at this time actually exists within the said Province ; and we see , with the utmost concern , that they have been countenanced and encouraged by unlawful combinations and engagements entered into by your Majesty 's subjects in several of the other Colonies , to the injury and oppression of many of their innocent fellow @-@ subjects , resident within the Kingdom of Great Britain , and the rest of your Majesty ' s Dominions .... 
 We ... shall ... pay attention and regard to any real grievances ... laid before us ; and whenever any of the Colonies shall make a proper application to us , we shall be ready to afford them every just and reasonable indulgence . At the same time we ... beseech your Majesty that you will ... enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the supreme Legislature ; and ... it is our fixed resolution , at the hazard of our lives and properties , to stand by your Majesty against all rebellious attempts in the maintenance of the just rights of your Majesty , and the two Houses of Parliament . 
 On April 14 , 1775 , Gage received instructions from Secretary of State William Legge , Earl of Dartmouth , to disarm the rebels and to imprison the rebellion 's leaders , but Dartmouth gave Gage considerable discretion in his commands . Gage 's decision to act promptly may have been influenced by information he received on April 15 , from a spy within the Provincial Congress , telling him that although the Congress was still divided on the need for armed resistance , delegates were being sent to the other New England colonies to see if they would cooperate in raising a New England army of 18 @,@ 000 colonial soldiers . 
 On the morning of April 18 , Gage ordered a mounted patrol of about 20 men under the command of Major Mitchell of the 5th Regiment of Foot into the surrounding country to intercept messengers who might be out on horseback . This patrol behaved differently from patrols sent out from Boston in the past , staying out after dark and asking travelers about the location of Samuel Adams and John Hancock . This had the unintended effect of alarming many residents and increasing their preparedness . The Lexington militia in particular began to muster early that evening , hours before receiving any word from Boston . A well @-@ known story alleges that after nightfall one farmer , Josiah Nelson , mistook the British patrol for the colonists and asked them , " Have you heard anything about when the regulars are coming out ? " upon which he was slashed on his scalp with a sword . However , the story of this incident was not published until over a century later , which suggests that it may be little more than a family myth . 
 Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith received orders from Gage on the afternoon of April 18 with instructions that he was not to read them until his troops were underway . He was to proceed from Boston " with utmost expedition and secrecy to Concord , where you will seize and destroy ... all Military stores ... But you will take care that the soldiers do not plunder the inhabitants or hurt private property . " Gage used his discretion and did not issue written orders for the arrest of rebel leaders , as he feared doing so might spark an uprising .

 On March 30 , 1775 , the Massachusetts Provincial Congress issued the following resolution : 
 Whenever the army under command of General Gage , or any part thereof to the number of five hundred , shall march out of the town of Boston , with artillery and baggage , it ought to be deemed a design to carry into execution by force the late acts of Parliament , the attempting of which , by the resolve of the late honourable Continental Congress , ought to be opposed ; and therefore the military force of the Province ought to be assembled , and an army of observation immediately formed , to act solely on the defensive so long as it can be justified on the principles of reason and self @-@ preservation . 
 The rebellion 's leaders — with the exception of Paul Revere and Joseph Warren — had all left Boston by April 8 . They had received word of Dartmouth 's secret instructions to General Gage from sources in London well before they reached Gage himself . Adams and Hancock had fled Boston to the home of one of Hancock 's relatives in Lexington , where they thought they would be safe from the immediate threat of arrest . 
 The Massachusetts militias had indeed been gathering a stock of weapons , powder , and supplies at Concord and much further west in Worcester . An expedition from Boston to Concord was widely anticipated . After a large contingent of regulars alarmed the countryside by an expedition from Boston to Watertown on March 30 , The Pennsylvania Journal , a newspaper in Philadelphia , reported , " It was supposed they were going to Concord , where the Provincial Congress is now sitting . A quantity of provisions and warlike stores are lodged there .... It is ... said they are intending to go out again soon . " 
 On April 8 , Paul Revere rode to Concord to warn the inhabitants that the British appeared to be planning an expedition . The townspeople decided to remove the stores and distribute them among other towns nearby . 
 The colonists were also aware that April 19 would be the date of the expedition , despite Gage 's efforts to keep the details hidden from all the British rank and file and even from the officers who would command the mission . There is reasonable speculation , although not proven , that the confidential source of this intelligence was Margaret Gage , General Gage 's New Jersey @-@ born wife , who had sympathies with the Colonial cause and a friendly relationship with Warren . 
 Between 9 and 10 pm on the night of April 18 , 1775 , Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the British troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord . Warren 's intelligence suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars ' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock . They did not worry about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord , since the supplies at Concord were safe , but they did think their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night . Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns . 
 = = = Militia forces assemble = = = 
 Dawes covered the southern land route by horseback across Boston Neck and over the Great Bridge to Lexington . Revere first gave instructions to send a signal to Charlestown using lanterns hung in the steeple of Boston 's Old North Church . He then traveled the northern water route , crossing the mouth of the Charles River by rowboat , slipping past the British warship HMS Somerset at anchor . Crossings were banned at that hour , but Revere safely landed in Charlestown and rode west to Lexington , warning almost every house along the route . Additional riders were sent north from Charlestown . 
 After they arrived in Lexington , Revere , Dawes , Hancock , and Adams discussed the situation with the militia assembling there . They believed that the forces leaving the city were too large for the sole task of arresting two men and that Concord was the main target . The Lexington men dispatched riders to the surrounding towns , and Revere and Dawes continued along the road to Concord accompanied by Samuel Prescott . In Lincoln , they ran into the British patrol led by Major Mitchell . Revere was captured , Dawes was thrown from his horse , and only Prescott escaped to reach Concord . Additional riders were sent out from Concord . 
 The ride of Revere , Dawes , and Prescott triggered a flexible system of " alarm and muster " that had been carefully developed months before , in reaction to the colonists ' impotent response to the Powder Alarm . This system was an improved version of an old notification network for use in times of emergency . The colonists had periodically used it during the early years of Indian wars in the colony , before it fell into disuse in the French and Indian War . In addition to other express riders delivering messages , bells , drums , alarm guns , bonfires and a trumpet were used for rapid communication from town to town , notifying the rebels in dozens of eastern Massachusetts villages that they should muster their militias because over 500 regulars were leaving Boston . This system was so effective that people in towns 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Boston were aware of the army 's movements while they were still unloading boats in Cambridge . These early warnings played a crucial role in assembling a sufficient number of colonial militia to inflict heavy damage on the British regulars later in the day . Adams and Hancock were eventually moved to safety , first to what is now Burlington and later to Billerica .

 Around dusk , General Gage called a meeting of his senior officers at the Province House . He informed them that instructions from Lord Dartmouth had arrived , ordering him to take action against the colonials . He also told them that the senior colonel of his regiments , Lieutenant Colonel Smith , would command , with Major John Pitcairn as his executive officer . The meeting adjourned around 8 : 30 pm , after which Earl Percy mingled with town folk on Boston Common . According to one account , the discussion among people there turned to the unusual movement of the British soldiers in the town . When Percy questioned one man further , the man replied , " Well , the regulars will miss their aim . " 
 " What aim ? " asked Percy . " Why , the cannon at Concord " was the reply . Upon hearing this , Percy quickly returned to Province House and relayed this information to General Gage . Stunned , Gage issued orders to prevent messengers from getting out of Boston , but these were too late to prevent Dawes and Revere from leaving . 
 The British regulars , around 700 infantry , were drawn from 11 of Gage 's 13 occupying infantry regiments . Major Pitcairn commanded ten elite light infantry companies , and Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Bernard commanded 11 grenadier companies , under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel Smith . 
 Of the troops assigned to the expedition , 350 were from grenadier companies drawn from the 4th ( King 's Own ) , 5th , 10th , 18th ( Royal Irish ) , 23rd , 38th , 43rd , 47th , 52nd and 59th Regiments of Foot , and the 1st Battalion of His Majesty 's Marine Forces . Protecting the grenadier companies were about 320 light infantry from the 4th , 5th , 10th , 23rd , 38th , 43rd , 47th , 52nd , and 59th Regiments , and the 1st Battalion of the Marines . Each company had its own lieutenant , but the majority of the captains commanding them were volunteers attached to them at the last minute , drawn from all the regiments stationed in Boston . This lack of familiarity between commander and company would cause problems during the battle . 
 The British began to awaken their troops at 9 pm on the night of April 18 and assembled them on the water 's edge on the western end of Boston Common by 10 pm . Colonel Smith was late in arriving , and there was no organized boat @-@ loading operation , resulting in confusion at the staging area . The boats used were naval barges that were packed so tightly that there was no room to sit down . When they disembarked near Phipps Farm in Cambridge , it was into waist @-@ deep water at midnight . After a lengthy halt to unload their gear , the regulars began their 17 miles ( 27 km ) march to Concord at about 2 am . During the wait they were provided with extra ammunition , cold salt pork , and hard sea biscuits . They did not carry knapsacks , since they would not be encamped . They carried their haversacks ( food bags ) , canteens , muskets , and accoutrements , and marched off in wet , muddy shoes and soggy uniforms . As they marched through Menotomy , sounds of the colonial alarms throughout the countryside caused the few officers who were aware of their mission to realize they had lost the element of surprise . 
 At about 3 am , Colonel Smith sent Major Pitcairn ahead with six companies of light infantry under orders to quick march to Concord . At about 4 am Smith made the wise but belated decision to send a messenger back to Boston asking for reinforcements .

 Though often styled a battle , in reality the engagement at Lexington was a minor brush or skirmish . As the regulars ' advance guard under Pitcairn entered Lexington at sunrise on April 19 , 1775 , about 80 Lexington militiamen emerged from Buckman Tavern and stood in ranks on the village common watching them , and between 40 and 100 spectators watched from along the side of the road . Their leader was Captain John Parker , a veteran of the French and Indian War , who was suffering from tuberculosis and was at times difficult to hear . Of the militiamen who lined up , nine had the surname Harrington , seven Munroe ( including the company 's orderly sergeant , William Munroe ) , four Parker , three Tidd , three Locke , and three Reed ; fully one quarter of them were related to Captain Parker in some way . This group of militiamen was part of Lexington 's " training band " , a way of organizing local militias dating back to the Puritans , and not what was styled a minuteman company . 
 After having waited most of the night with no sign of any British troops ( and wondering if Paul Revere 's warning was true ) , at about 4 : 15 AM , Parker got his confirmation . Thaddeus Bowman , the last scout that Parker had sent out , rode up at a gallop and told him that they were not only coming , but coming in force and they were close . Captain Parker was clearly aware that he was outmatched in the confrontation and was not prepared to sacrifice his men for no purpose . He knew that most of the colonists ' powder and military supplies at Concord had already been hidden . No war had been declared . ( The Declaration of Independence was a year in the future ) . He also knew the British had gone on such expeditions before in Massachusetts , found nothing , and marched back to Boston . 
 Parker had every reason to expect that to occur again . The Regulars would march to Concord , find nothing , and return to Boston , tired but empty @-@ handed . He positioned his company carefully . He placed them in parade @-@ ground formation , on Lexington Common . They were in plain sight ( not hiding behind walls ) , but not blocking the road to Concord . They made a show of political and military determination , but no effort to prevent the march of the Regulars . Many years later , one of the participants recalled Parker 's words as being what is now engraved in stone at the site of the battle : " Stand your ground ; don 't fire unless fired upon , but if they mean to have a war , let it begin here . " According to Parker 's sworn deposition taken after the battle : 
 " I ... ordered our Militia to meet on the Common in said Lexington to consult what to do , and concluded not to be discovered , nor meddle or make with said Regular Troops ( if they should approach ) unless they should insult or molest us ; and , upon their sudden Approach , I immediately ordered our Militia to disperse , and not to fire : — Immediately said Troops made their appearance and rushed furiously , fired upon , and killed eight of our Party without receiving any Provocation therefor from us . " 
 Rather than turn left towards Concord , Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair , at the head of the advance guard , decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the companies onto the Common itself , in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia . Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them . The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down the road toward Boston . 
 = = = = First shot = = = = 
 A British officer ( probably Pitcairn , but accounts are uncertain , as it may also have been Lieutenant William Sutherland ) then rode forward , waving his sword , and called out for the assembled militia to disperse , and may also have ordered them to " lay down your arms , you damned rebels ! " Captain Parker told his men instead to disperse and go home , but , because of the confusion , the yelling all around , and due to the raspiness of Parker 's tubercular voice , some did not hear him , some left very slowly , and none laid down their arms . Both Parker and Pitcairn ordered their men to hold fire , but a shot was fired from an unknown source . 
 " [ A ] t 5 o ’ clock we arrived [ in Lexington ] , and saw a number of people , I believe between 200 and 300 , formed in a common in the middle of town ; we still continued advancing , keeping prepared against an attack through without intending to attack them ; but on our coming near them they fired on us two shots , upon which our men without any orders , rushed upon them , fired and put them to flight ; several of them were killed , we could not tell how many , because they were behind walls and into the woods . We had a man of the 10th light Infantry wounded , nobody else was hurt . We then formed on the Common , but with some difficulty , the men were so wild they could hear no orders ; we waited a considerable time there , and at length proceeded our way to Concord . " 
 According to one member of Parker 's militia , none of the Americans had discharged their muskets as they faced the oncoming British troops . The British did suffer one casualty , a slight wound , the particulars of which were corroborated by a deposition made by Corporal John Munroe . Munroe stated that : 
 " After the first fire of the regulars , I thought , and so stated to Ebenezer Munroe ... who stood next to me on the left , that they had fired nothing but powder ; but on the second firing , Munroe stated they had fired something more than powder , for he had received a wound in his arm ; and now , said he , to use his own words , ' I 'll give them the guts of my gun . ' We then both took aim at the main body of British troops the smoke preventing our seeing anything but the heads of some of their horses and discharged our pieces . " 
 Some witnesses among the regulars reported the first shot was fired by a colonial onlooker from behind a hedge or around the corner of a tavern . Some observers reported a mounted British officer firing first . Both sides generally agreed that the initial shot did not come from the men on the ground immediately facing each other . Speculation arose later in Lexington that a man named Solomon Brown fired the first shot from inside the tavern or from behind a wall , but this has been discredited . Some witnesses ( on each side ) claimed that someone on the other side fired first ; however , many more witnesses claimed to not know . Yet another theory is that the first shot was one fired by the British , that killed Asahel Porter , their prisoner who was running away ( he had been told to walk away and he would be let go , though he panicked and began to run ) . Historian David Hackett Fischer has proposed that there may actually have been multiple near @-@ simultaneous shots . Historian Mark Urban claims the British surged forward with bayonets ready in an undisciplined way , provoking a few scattered shots from the militia . In response the British troops , without orders , fired a devastating volley . This lack of discipline among the British troops had a key role in the escalation of violence . 
 Witnesses at the scene described several intermittent shots fired from both sides before the lines of regulars began to fire volleys without receiving orders to do so . A few of the militiamen believed at first that the regulars were only firing powder with no ball , but when they realized the truth , few if any of the militia managed to load and return fire . The rest ran for their lives . 
 " We Nathaniel Mulliken , Philip Russell , [ and 32 other men ... ] do testify and declare , that on the nineteenth in the morning , being informed that ... a body of regulars were marching from Boston towards Concord ... About five o ’ clock in the morning , hearing our drum beat , we proceeded towards the parade , and soon found that a large body of troops were marching towards us , some of our company were coming to the parade , and others had reached it , at which time , the company began to disperse , whilst our backs were turned on the troops , we were fired on by them , and a number of our men were instantly killed and wounded , not a gun was fired by any person in our company on the regulars to our knowledge before they fired on us , and continued firing until we had all made our escape . " 
 The regulars then charged forward with bayonets . Captain Parker 's cousin Jonas was run through . Eight Lexington men were killed , and ten were wounded ; only one British soldier of the 10th Regiment of Foot was wounded . The eight colonists killed were John Brown , Samuel Hadley , Caleb Harrington , Jonathon Harrington , Robert Munroe , Isaac Muzzey , Asahel Porter , and Jonas Parker . Jonathon Harrington , fatally wounded by a British musket ball , managed to crawl back to his home , and died on his own doorstep . One wounded man , Prince Estabrook , was a black slave who was serving in the militia . 
 The companies under Pitcairn 's command got beyond their officers ' control in part because they were unaware of the actual purpose of the day 's mission . They fired in different directions and prepared to enter private homes . Colonel Smith , who was just arriving with the remainder of the regulars , heard the musket fire and rode forward from the grenadier column to see the action . He quickly found a drummer and ordered him to beat assembly . The grenadiers arrived shortly thereafter , and once order was restored among the soldiers , the light infantry were permitted to fire a victory volley , after which the column was reformed and marched on toward Concord . 
 = = = Concord = = = 
 In response to the raised alarm , the militiamen of Concord and Lincoln had mustered in Concord . They received reports of firing at Lexington , and were not sure whether to wait until they could be reinforced by troops from towns nearby , or to stay and defend the town , or to move east and greet the British Army from superior terrain . A column of militia marched down the road toward Lexington to meet the British , traveling about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 km ) until they met the approaching column of regulars . As the regulars numbered about 700 and the militia at this time only numbered about 250 , the militia column turned around and marched back into Concord , preceding the regulars by a distance of about 500 yards ( 457 m ) . The militia retreated to a ridge overlooking the town , and their officers discussed what to do next . Caution prevailed , and Colonel James Barrett withdrew from the town of Concord and led the men across the North Bridge to a hill about a mile north of town , where they could continue to watch the troop movements of the British and the activities in the center of town . This step proved fortuitous , as the ranks of the militia continued to grow as minuteman companies arriving from the western towns joined them there . 
 = = = = The search for militia supplies = = = = 
 When the British troops arrived in the village of Concord , Lt. Col. Smith divided them to carry out Gage 's orders . The 10th Regiment 's company of grenadiers secured South Bridge under Captain Mundy Pole , while seven companies of light infantry under Captain Parsons , numbering about 100 , secured the North Bridge , where they were visible across the cleared fields to the assembling militia companies . Captain Parsons took four companies from the 5th , 23rd , 38th and 52nd Regiments up the road 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) beyond the North Bridge to search Barrett 's Farm , where intelligence indicated supplies would be found . Two companies from the 4th and 10th Regiments were stationed to guard their return route , and one company from the 43rd remained guarding the bridge itself . These companies , which were under the relatively inexperienced command of Captain Walter Laurie , were aware that they were significantly outnumbered by the 400 @-@ plus militiamen . The concerned Captain Laurie sent a messenger to Lt. Col. Smith requesting reinforcements . 
 Using detailed information provided by Loyalist spies , the grenadier companies searched the small town for military supplies . When they arrived at Ephraim Jones 's tavern , by the jail on the South Bridge road , they found the door barred shut , and Jones refused them entry . According to reports provided by local Loyalists , Pitcairn knew cannon had been buried on the property . Jones was ordered at gunpoint to show where the guns were buried . These turned out to be three massive pieces , firing 24 @-@ pound shot , that were much too heavy to use defensively , but very effective against fortifications , with sufficient range to bombard the city of Boston from other parts of nearby mainland . The grenadiers smashed the trunnions of these three guns so they could not be mounted . They also burned some gun carriages found in the village meetinghouse , and when the fire spread to the meetinghouse itself , local resident Martha Moulton persuaded the soldiers to help in a bucket brigade to save the building . Nearly a hundred barrels of flour and salted food were thrown into the millpond , as were 550 pounds of musket balls . Of the damage done , only that done to the cannon was significant . All of the shot and much of the food was recovered after the British left . During the search , the regulars were generally scrupulous in their treatment of the locals , including paying for food and drink consumed . This excessive politeness was used to advantage by the locals , who were able to misdirect searches from several smaller caches of militia supplies . 
 Barrett 's Farm had been an arsenal weeks before , but few weapons remained now , and according to family legend , these were quickly buried in furrows to look like a crop had been planted . The troops sent there did not find any supplies of consequence . 
 = = = = The North Bridge = = = = 
 Colonel Barrett 's troops , upon seeing smoke rising from the village square as the British burned cannon carriages , and seeing only a few light infantry companies directly below them , decided to march back toward the town from their vantage point on <unk> Hill to a lower , closer flat hilltop about 300 yards ( 274 m ) from the North Bridge . As the militia advanced , the two British companies from the 4th and 10th Regiments that held the position near the road retreated to the bridge and yielded the hill to Barrett 's men . 
 Five full companies of Minutemen and five more of militia from Acton , Concord , Bedford and Lincoln occupied this hill as more groups of men streamed in , totaling at least 400 against Captain Laurie 's light infantry companies , a force totaling 90 – 95 men . Barrett ordered the Massachusetts men to form one long line two abreast on the highway leading down to the bridge , and then he called for another consultation . While overlooking North Bridge from the top of the hill , Barrett , Lt. Col. John Robinson of Westford and the other Captains discussed possible courses of action . Captain Isaac Davis of Acton , whose troops had arrived late , declared his willingness to defend a town not their own by saying , " I 'm not afraid to go , and I haven 't a man that 's afraid to go . " 
 Barrett told the men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon , and then ordered them to advance . Laurie ordered the British companies guarding the bridge to retreat across it . One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance , but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge . The Minutemen and militia from Concord , Acton and a handful of Westford Minutemen , advanced in column formation , two by two , led by Major Buttrick , Lt. Col. Robinson , then Capt. Davis , on the light infantry , keeping to the road , since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River . 
 Captain Laurie then made a poor tactical decision . Since his summons for help had not produced any results , he ordered his men to form positions for " street firing " behind the bridge in a column running perpendicular to the river . This formation was appropriate for sending a large volume of fire into a narrow alley between the buildings of a city , but not for an open path behind a bridge . Confusion reigned as regulars retreating over the bridge tried to form up in the street @-@ firing position of the other troops . Lieutenant Sutherland , who was in the rear of the formation , saw Laurie 's mistake and ordered flankers to be sent out . But as he was from a company different from the men under his command , only three soldiers obeyed him . The remainder tried as best they could in the confusion to follow the orders of the superior officer . 
 A shot rang out . It was likely a warning shot fired by a panicked , exhausted British soldier from the 43rd , according to Captain Laurie 's report to his commander after the fight . Two other regulars then fired immediately after that , shots splashing in the river , and then the narrow group up front , possibly thinking the order to fire had been given , fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them . 
 Two of the Acton Minutemen , Private Abner Hosmer and Captain Isaac Davis , who were at the head of the line marching to the bridge , were hit and killed instantly . Rev. Dr. Ripley recalled : 
 The Americans commenced their march in double file … In a minute or two , the Americans being in quick motion and within ten or fifteen rods of the bridge , a single gun was fired by a British soldier , which marked the way , passing under Col. Robinson ’ s arm and slightly wounding the side of Luther Blanchard , a fifer , in the Acton Company . 
 Four more men were wounded . Major Buttrick then yelled to the militia , " Fire , for God 's sake , fellow soldiers , fire ! " At this point the lines were separated by the Concord River and the bridge , and were only 50 yards ( 46 m ) apart . The few front rows of colonists , bound by the road and blocked from forming a line of fire , managed to fire over each other 's heads and shoulders at the regulars massed across the bridge . Four of the eight British officers and sergeants , who were leading from the front of their troops , were wounded by the volley of musket fire . At least three privates ( Thomas Smith , Patrick Gray , and James Hall , all from the 4th ) were killed or mortally wounded , and nine were wounded . In 1824 , Reverend and Minuteman Joseph Thaxter wrote : 
 I was an eyewitness to the following facts . The people of Westford and Acton , some few of Concord , were the first who faced the British at Concord bridge . The British had placed about ninety men as a guard at the North Bridge ; we had then no certain information that any had been killed at Lexington , we saw the British making destruction in the town of Concord ; it was proposed to advance to the bridge ; on this Colonel Robinson , of Westford , together with Major Buttrick , took the lead ; strict orders were given not to fire , unless the British fired first ; when they advanced about halfway on the causeway the British fired one gun , a second , a third , and then the whole body ; they killed Colonel Davis , of Acton , and a Mr. Hosmer . Our people then fired over one another ’ s heads , being in a long column , two and two ; they killed two and wounded eleven . Lieutenant Hawkstone , said to be the greatest beauty of the British army , had his cheeks so badly wounded that it disfigured him much , of which he bitterly complained . On this , the British fled , and assembled on the hill , the north side of Concord , and dressed their wounded , and then began their retreat . As they descended the hill near the road that comes out from Bedford they were pursued ; Colonel Bridge , with a few men from Bedford and Chelmsford , came up , and killed several men . 
 The regulars found themselves trapped in a situation where they were both outnumbered and outmaneuvered . Lacking effective leadership and terrified at the superior numbers of the enemy , with their spirit broken , and likely not having experienced combat before , they abandoned their wounded , and fled to the safety of the approaching grenadier companies coming from the town center , isolating Captain Parsons and the companies searching for arms at Barrett 's Farm . 
 = = = = After the fight = = = = 
 The colonists were stunned by their success . No one had actually believed either side would shoot to kill the other . Some advanced ; many more retreated ; and some went home to see to the safety of their homes and families . Colonel Barrett eventually began to recover control . He moved some of the militia back to the hilltop 300 yards ( 274 m ) away and sent Major Buttrick with others across the bridge to a defensive position on a hill behind a stone wall . 
 Lieutenant Colonel Smith heard the exchange of fire from his position in the town moments after he received the request for reinforcements from Laurie . He quickly assembled two companies of grenadiers to lead toward the North Bridge himself . As these troops marched , they met the shattered remnants of the three light infantry companies running towards them . Smith was concerned about the four companies that had been at Barrett 's , since their route to town was now unprotected . When he saw the Minutemen in the distance behind their wall , he halted his two companies and moved forward with only his officers to take a closer look . One of the Minutemen behind that wall observed , " If we had fired , I believe we could have killed almost every officer there was in the front , but we had no orders to fire and there wasn 't a gun fired . " During a tense standoff lasting about 10 minutes , a mentally ill local man named Elias Brown wandered through both sides selling hard cider . 
 At this point , the detachment of regulars sent to Barrett 's farm marched back from their fruitless search of that area . They passed through the now mostly @-@ deserted battlefield , and saw dead and wounded comrades lying on the bridge . There was one who looked to them as if he had been scalped , which angered and shocked the British soldiers . They crossed the bridge and returned to the town by 11 : 30 AM , under the watchful eyes of the colonists , who continued to maintain defensive positions . The regulars continued to search for and destroy colonial military supplies in the town , ate lunch , reassembled for marching , and left Concord after noon . This delay in departure gave colonial militiamen from outlying towns additional time to reach the road back to Boston .

 Lieutenant Colonel Smith , concerned about the safety of his men , sent flankers to follow a ridge and protect his forces from the roughly 1 @,@ 000 colonials now in the field as the British marched east out of Concord . This ridge ended near Meriam 's Corner , a crossroads about a mile ( 2 km ) outside the village of Concord , where the main road came to a bridge across a small stream . To cross the narrow bridge , the British had to pull the flankers back into the main column and close ranks to a mere three soldiers abreast . Colonial militia companies arriving from the north and east had converged at this point , and presented a clear numerical advantage over the regulars . The British were now witnessing once again what General Gage had hoped to avoid by dispatching the expedition in secrecy and in the dark of night : the ability of the colonial militiamen to rise and converge by the thousands when British forces ventured out of Boston . As the last of the British column marched over the narrow bridge , the British rear guard wheeled and fired a volley at the colonial militiamen , who had been firing irregularly and ineffectively from a distance but now had closed to within musket range . The colonists returned fire , this time with deadly effect . Two regulars were killed and perhaps six wounded , with no colonial casualties . Smith sent out his flanking troops again after crossing the small bridge . 
 On Brooks Hill ( also known as Hardy 's Hill ) about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) past Meriam 's Corner , nearly 500 militiamen had assembled to the south of the road , awaiting opportunity to fire down upon the British column on the road below . Smith 's leading forces charged up the hill to drive them off , but the colonists did not withdraw , inflicting significant casualties on the attackers . Smith withdrew his men from Brooks Hill , and the column continued on to another small bridge into Lincoln , at Brooks Tavern , where more militia companies intensified the attack from the north side of the road . 
 The regulars soon reached a point in the road now referred to as the " Bloody Angle " where the road rises and curves sharply to the left through a lightly @-@ wooded area . At this place , the militia company from Woburn had positioned themselves on the southeast side of the bend in the road in a rocky , lightly @-@ wooded field . Additional militia flowing parallel to the road from the engagement at Meriam 's Corner positioned themselves on the northwest side of the road , catching the British in a crossfire , while other militia companies on the road closed from behind to attack . Some 500 yards ( 460 m ) further along , the road took another sharp curve , this time to the right , and again the British column was caught by another large force of militiamen firing from both sides . In passing through these two sharp curves , the British force lost thirty soldiers killed or wounded , and four colonial militia were also killed , including Captain Jonathan Wilson Bedford , Captain Nathan Wyman of Billerica , Lt. John Bacon of Natick , and Daniel Thompson of Woburn . The British soldiers escaped by breaking into a trot , a pace that the colonials could not maintain through the woods and swampy terrain . Colonial forces on the road itself behind the British were too densely packed and disorganized to mount more than a harassing attack from the rear . 
 As militia forces from other towns continued to arrive , the colonial forces had risen to about 2 @,@ 000 men . The road now straightened to the east , with cleared fields and orchards along the sides . Lt. Col. Smith sent out flankers again , who succeeded in trapping some militia from behind and inflicting casualties . British casualties were also mounting from these engagements and from persistent long @-@ range fire from the militiamen , and the exhausted British were running out of ammunition . 
 When the British column neared the boundary between Lincoln and Lexington , it encountered another ambush from a hill overlooking the road , set by Captain John Parker 's Lexington militiamen , including some of them bandaged up from the encounter in Lexington earlier in the day . At this point , Lt. Col. Smith was wounded in the thigh and knocked from his horse . Major John Pitcairn assumed effective command of the column and sent light infantry companies up the hill to clear the militia forces . 
 The light infantry cleared two additional hills as the column continued east — " The Bluff " and " Fiske Hill " — and took still more casualties from ambushes set by fresh militia companies joining the battle . In one of the musket volleys from the colonial soldiers , Major Pitcairn 's horse bolted in fright , throwing Pitcairn to the ground and injuring his arm . Now both principal leaders of the expedition were injured or unhorsed , and their men were tired , thirsty , and exhausting their ammunition . A few surrendered or were captured ; some now broke formation and ran forward toward Lexington . In the words of one British officer , " we began to run rather than retreat in order . ... We attempted to stop the men and form them two deep , but to no purpose , the confusion increased rather than lessened . ... the officers got to the front and presented their bayonets , and told the men if they advanced they should die . Upon this , they began to form up under heavy fire . " 
 Only one British officer remained uninjured among the three companies at the head of the British column as it approach Lexington Center . He understood the column 's perilous situation : " There were very few men had any ammunition left , and so fatigued that we could not keep flanking parties out , so that we must soon have laid down our arms , or been picked off by the Rebels at their pleasure — nearer to — and we were not able to keep them off . " He then heard cheering further ahead . A full brigade , about 1 @,@ 000 men with artillery under the command of Earl Percy , had arrived to rescue them . It was about 2 : 30 PM , and the British column had now been on the march since 2 o 'clock in the morning . Westford Minuteman , Rev. Joseph Thaxter , wrote of his account : 
 We pursued them and killed some ; when they got to Lexington , they were so close pursued and fatigued , that they must have soon surrendered , had not Lord Percy met them with a large reinforcement and two field @-@ pieces . They fired them , but the balls went high over our heads . But no cannon ever did more execution , such stories of their effects had been spread by the tories through our troops , that from this time more wont back than pursed . We pursued to Charlestown Common , and then retired to Cambridge . When the army collected at Cambridge , Colonel Prescott with his regiment of minute men , and John Robinson , his Lieutenant Colonel , were prompt at being at their post . 
 In their accounts afterward , British officers and soldiers alike noted their frustration that the colonial militiamen fired at them from behind trees and stone walls , rather than confronting them in large , linear formations in the style of European warfare . This image of the individual colonial farmer , musket in hand and fighting under his own command , has also been fostered in American myth : " Chasing the red @-@ coats down the lane / Then crossing the fields to emerge again / Under the trees at the turn of the road , / And only pausing to fire and load . " To the contrary , beginning at the North Bridge and throughout the British retreat , the colonial militias repeatedly operated as coordinated companies , even when dispersed to take advantage of cover . Reflecting on the British experience that day , Earl Percy understood the significance of the American tactics : 
 During the whole affair the Rebels attacked us in a very scattered , irregular manner , but with perseverance & resolution , nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body . Indeed , they knew too well what was proper , to do so . Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob , will find himself much mistaken . They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about , having been employed as Rangers against the Indians & Canadians , & this country being much covered with wood , and hilly , is very advantageous for their method of fighting . 
 = = = = Percy 's rescue = = = = 
 General Gage had anticipated that Lt. Col. Smith 's expedition might require reinforcement , so Gage drafted orders for reinforcing units to assemble in Boston at 4 AM . But in his obsession for secrecy , Gage had sent only one copy of the orders to the adjutant of the 1st Brigade , whose servant then left the envelope on a table . Also at about 4 AM , the British column was within three miles of Lexington , and Lt. Col. Smith now had clear indication that all element of surprise had been lost and that alarm was spreading throughout the countryside . So he sent a rider back to Boston with a request for reinforcements . At about 5 AM , the rider reached Boston , and the 1st Brigade was ordered to assemble : the line infantry companies of the 4th , 23rd , and 47th Regiments , and a battalion of Royal Marines , under the command of Earl Percy . Unfortunately for the British , once again only one copy of the orders were sent to each commander , and the order for the Royal Marines was delivered to the desk of Major John Pitcairn , who was already on the Lexington Common with Smith 's column at that hour . After these delays , Percy 's brigade , about 1 @,@ 000 strong , left Boston at about 8 : 45 AM , headed toward Lexington . Along the way , the story is told , they marched to the tune of " Yankee Doodle " to taunt the inhabitants of the area . By the Battle of Bunker Hill less than two months later , the song would become a popular anthem for the colonial forces . 
 Percy took the land route across Boston Neck and over the Great Bridge , which some quick @-@ thinking colonists had stripped of its planking to delay the British . His men then came upon an absent @-@ minded tutor at Harvard College and asked him which road would take them to Lexington . The Harvard man , apparently oblivious to the reality of what was happening around him , showed him the proper road without thinking . ( He was later compelled to leave the country for inadvertently supporting the enemy . ) Percy 's troops arrived in Lexington at about 2 : 00 PM . They could hear gunfire in the distance as they set up their cannon and deployed lines of regulars on high ground with commanding views of the town . Colonel Smith 's men approached like a fleeing mob with the full complement of colonial militia in close formation pursuing them . Percy ordered his artillery to open fire at extreme range , dispersing the colonial militiamen . Smith 's men collapsed with exhaustion once they reached the safety of Percy 's lines . 
 Against the advice of his Master of Ordnance , Percy had left Boston without spare ammunition for his men or for the two artillery pieces they brought with them , thinking the extra wagons would slow him down . Each man in Percy 's brigade had only 36 rounds , and each artillery piece was supplied with only a few rounds carried in side @-@ boxes . After Percy had left the city , Gage directed two ammunition wagons guarded by one officer and thirteen men to follow . This convoy was intercepted by a small party of older , veteran militiamen still on the " alarm list , " who could not join their militia companies because they were well over 60 years of age . These men rose up in ambush and demanded the surrender of the wagons , but the regulars ignored them and drove their horses on . The old men opened fire , shot the lead horses , killed two sergeants , and wounded the officer . The British survivors ran , and six of them threw their weapons into a pond before they surrendered . 
 = = = = Lexington to Menotomy = = = = 
 Percy assumed control of the combined forces of about 1 @,@ 700 men and let them rest , eat , drink , and have their wounds tended at field headquarters ( Munroe Tavern ) before resuming the march . They set out from Lexington at about 3 : 30 PM , in a formation that emphasized defense along the sides and rear of the column . Wounded regulars rode on the cannon and were forced to hop off when they were fired at by gatherings of militia . Percy 's men were often surrounded , but they had the tactical advantage of interior lines . Percy could shift his units more easily to where they were needed , while the colonial militia were required to move around the outside of his formation . Percy placed Smith 's men in the middle of the column , while the 23rd Regiment 's line companies made up the column 's rear guard . Because of information provided by Smith and Pitcairn about how the Americans were attacking , Percy ordered the rear guard to be rotated every mile or so , to allow some of his troops to rest briefly . Flanking companies were sent to both sides of the road , and a powerful force of Marines acted as the vanguard to clear the road ahead . 
 During the respite at Lexington , Brigadier General William Heath arrived and took command of the militia . Earlier in the day , he had traveled first to Watertown to discuss tactics with Joseph Warren , who had left Boston that morning , and other members of the Massachusetts Committee of Safety . Heath and Warren reacted to Percy 's artillery and flankers by ordering the militiamen to avoid close formations that would attract cannon fire . Instead , they surrounded Percy 's marching square with a moving ring of skirmishers at a distance to inflict maximum casualties at minimum risk . 
 A few mounted militiamen on the road would dismount , fire muskets at the approaching regulars , then remount and gallop ahead to repeat the tactic . Unmounted militia would often fire from long range , in the hope of hitting somebody in the main column of soldiers on the road and surviving , since both British and colonials used muskets with an effective combat range of about 50 yards ( 46 m ) . Infantry units would apply pressure to the sides of the British column . When it moved out of range , those units would move around and forward to re @-@ engage the column further down the road . Heath sent messengers out to intercept arriving militia units , directing them to appropriate places along the road to engage the regulars . Some towns sent supply wagons to assist in feeding and rearming the militia . Heath and Warren did lead skirmishers in small actions into battle themselves , but it was the presence of effective leadership that probably had the greatest impact on the success of these tactics . Percy wrote of the colonial tactics , " The rebels attacked us in a very scattered , irregular manner , but with perseverance and resolution , nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body . Indeed , they knew too well what was proper , to do so . Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob , will find himself very much mistaken . " 
 The fighting grew more intense as Percy 's forces crossed from Lexington into Menotomy . Fresh militia poured gunfire into the British ranks from a distance , and individual homeowners began to fight from their own property . Some homes were also used as sniper positions , turning the situation into a soldier 's nightmare : house @-@ to @-@ house fighting . Jason Russell pleaded for his friends to fight alongside him to defend his house by saying , " An Englishman 's home is his castle . " He stayed and was killed in his doorway . His friends , depending on which account is to be believed , either hid in the cellar , or died in the house from bullets and bayonets after shooting at the soldiers who followed them in . The Jason Russell House still stands and contains bullet holes from this fight . A militia unit that attempted an ambush from Russell 's orchard was caught by flankers , and eleven men were killed , some allegedly after they had surrendered . 
 Percy lost control of his men , and British soldiers began to commit atrocities to repay for the supposed scalping at the North Bridge and for their own casualties at the hands of a distant , often unseen enemy . Based on the word of Pitcairn and other wounded officers from Smith 's command , Percy had learned that the Minutemen were using stone walls , trees and buildings in these more thickly settled towns closer to Boston to hide behind and shoot at the column . He ordered the flank companies to clear the colonial militiamen out of such places . 
 Many of the junior officers in the flank parties had difficulty stopping their exhausted , enraged men from killing everyone they found inside these buildings . For example , two innocent drunks who refused to hide in the basement of a tavern in Menotomy were killed only because they were suspected of being involved with the day 's events . Although many of the accounts of ransacking and burnings were exaggerated later by the colonists for propaganda value ( and to get financial compensation from the colonial government ) , it is certainly true that taverns along the road were ransacked and the liquor stolen by the troops , who in some cases became drunk themselves . One church 's communion silver was stolen but was later recovered after it was sold in Boston . Aged Menotomy resident Samuel Whittemore killed three regulars before he was attacked by a British contingent and left for dead . ( He recovered from his wounds and later died in 1793 at age 98 . ) All told , far more blood was shed in Menotomy and Cambridge than elsewhere that day . The colonists lost 25 men killed and nine wounded there , and the British lost 40 killed and 80 wounded , with the 47th Foot and the Marines suffering the highest casualties . Each was about half the day 's fatalities . 
 = = = = Menotomy to Charlestown = = = = 
 The British troops crossed the Menotomy River ( today known as Alewife Brook ) into Cambridge , and the fight grew more intense . Fresh militia arrived in close array instead of in a scattered formation , and Percy used his two artillery pieces and flankers at a crossroads called Watson 's Corner to inflict heavy damage on them . 
 Earlier in the day , Heath had ordered the Great Bridge to be dismantled . Percy 's brigade was about to approach the broken @-@ down bridge and a riverbank filled with militia when Percy directed his troops down a narrow track ( now Beech Street , near present @-@ day Porter Square ) and onto the road to Charlestown . The militia ( now numbering about 4 @,@ 000 ) were unprepared for this movement , and the circle of fire was broken . An American force moved to occupy Prospect Hill ( in modern @-@ day Somerville ) , which dominated the road , but Percy moved his cannon to the front and dispersed them with his last rounds of ammunition . 
 A large militia force arrived from Salem and Marblehead . They might have cut off Percy 's route to Charlestown , but these men halted on nearby Winter Hill and allowed the British to escape . Some accused the commander of this force , Colonel Timothy Pickering , of permitting the troops to pass because he still hoped to avoid war by preventing a total defeat of the regulars . Pickering later claimed that he had stopped on Heath 's orders , but Heath denied this . It was nearly dark when Pitcairn 's Marines defended a final attack on Percy 's rear as they entered Charlestown . The regulars took up strong positions on the hills of Charlestown . Some of them had been without sleep for two days and had marched 40 miles ( 64 km ) in 21 hours , eight hours of which had been spent under fire . But now they held high ground protected by heavy guns from HMS Somerset . Gage quickly sent over line companies of two fresh regiments — the 10th and 64th — to occupy the high ground in Charlestown and build fortifications . Although they were begun , the fortifications were never completed and would later be a starting point for the militia works built two months later in June before the Battle of Bunker Hill . General Heath studied the position of the British Army and decided to withdraw the militia to Cambridge . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In the morning , Boston was surrounded by a huge militia army , numbering over 15 @,@ 000 , which had marched from throughout New England . Unlike the Powder Alarm , the rumors of spilled blood were true , and the Revolutionary War had begun . 
 Now under the leadership of General Artemas Ward , who arrived on the 20th and replaced Brigadier General William Heath , they formed a siege line extending from Chelsea , around the peninsulas of Boston and Charlestown , to Roxbury , effectively surrounding Boston on three sides . In the days immediately following , the size of the colonial forces grew , as militias from New Hampshire , Rhode Island , and Connecticut arrived on the scene . The Second Continental Congress adopted these men into the beginnings of the Continental Army . Even now , after open warfare had started , Gage still refused to impose martial law in Boston . He persuaded the town 's selectmen to surrender all private weapons in return for promising that any inhabitant could leave town . 
 The battle was not a major one in terms of tactics or casualties . However , in terms of supporting the British political strategy behind the Intolerable Acts and the military strategy behind the Powder Alarms , the battle was a significant failure because the expedition contributed to the fighting it was intended to prevent , and because few weapons were actually seized . 
 The battle was followed by a war for British political opinion . Within four days of the battle , the Massachusetts Provincial Congress had collected scores of sworn testimonies from militiamen and from British prisoners . When word leaked out a week after the battle that Gage was sending his official description of events to London , the Provincial Congress sent a packet of these detailed depositions , signed by over 100 participants in the events , on a faster ship . The documents were presented to a sympathetic official and printed by the London newspapers two weeks before Gage 's report arrived . Gage 's official report was too vague on particulars to influence anyone 's opinion . George Germain , no friend of the colonists , wrote , " the Bostonians are in the right to make the King 's troops the aggressors and claim a victory . " Politicians in London tended to blame Gage for the conflict instead of their own policies and instructions . The British troops in Boston variously blamed General Gage and Colonel Smith for the failures at Lexington and Concord . 
 The day after the battle , John Adams left his home in Braintree to ride along the battlefields . He became convinced that " the Die was cast , the Rubicon crossed . " Thomas Paine in Philadelphia had previously thought of the argument between the colonies and the Home Country as " a kind of law @-@ suit " , but after news of the battle reached him , he " rejected the hardened , sullen @-@ tempered Pharaoh of England forever . " George Washington received the news at Mount Vernon and wrote to a friend , " the once @-@ happy and peaceful plains of America are either to be drenched in blood or inhabited by slaves . Sad alternative ! But can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice ? " A group of hunters on the frontier named their campsite Lexington when they heard news of the battle in June . It eventually became the city of Lexington , Kentucky .

 It was important to the early American government that an image of British fault and American innocence be maintained for this first battle of the war . The history of Patriot preparations , intelligence , warning signals , and uncertainty about the first shot was rarely discussed in the public sphere for decades . The story of the wounded British soldier at the North Bridge , hors de combat , struck down on the head by a Minuteman using a hatchet , the purported " scalping " , was strongly suppressed . <unk> mentioning some of these activities were not published and were returned to the participants ( this notably happened to Paul Revere ) . Paintings portrayed the Lexington fight as an unjustified slaughter . 
 The issue of which side was to blame grew during the early nineteenth century . For example , older participants ' testimony in later life about Lexington and Concord differed greatly from their depositions taken under oath in 1775 . All now said the British fired first at Lexington , whereas fifty or so years before , they weren 't sure . All now said they fired back , but in 1775 , they said few were able to . The " Battle " took on an almost mythical quality in the American consciousness . Legend became more important than truth . A complete shift occurred , and the Patriots were portrayed as actively fighting for their cause , rather than as suffering innocents . Paintings of the Lexington skirmish began to portray the militia standing and fighting back in defiance . 
 Ralph Waldo Emerson immortalized the events at the North Bridge in his 1837 " Concord Hymn " . The " Concord Hymn " became important because it commemorated the beginning of the American Revolution , and that for much of the 19th century it was a means by which Americans learned about the Revolution , helping to forge the identity of the nation . 
 After 1860 , several generations of schoolchildren memorized Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's poem " Paul Revere 's Ride " . Historically it is inaccurate ( for example , Paul Revere never made it to Concord ) , but it captures the idea that an individual can change the course of history . 
 In the 20th century , popular and historical opinion varied about the events of the historic day , often reflecting the political mood of the time . Isolationist anti @-@ war sentiments before the World Wars bred skepticism about the nature of Paul Revere 's contribution ( if any ) to the efforts to rouse the militia . Anglophilia in the United States after the turn of the twentieth century led to more balanced approaches to the history of the battle . During World War I , a film about Paul Revere 's ride was seized under the Espionage Act of 1917 for promoting discord between the United States and Britain . 
 During the Cold War , Revere was used not only as a patriotic symbol , but also as a capitalist one . In 1961 , novelist Howard Fast published April Morning , an account of the battle from a fictional 15 @-@ year @-@ old 's perspective , and reading of the book has been frequently assigned in American secondary schools . A film version was produced for television in 1987 , starring Chad Lowe and Tommy Lee Jones . In the 1990s , parallels were drawn between American tactics in the Vietnam War and those of the British Army at Lexington and Concord . 
 The site of the battle in Lexington is now known as the Lexington Battle Green , has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places , and is a National Historic Landmark . Several memorials commemorating the battle have been established there . 
 The lands surrounding the North Bridge in Concord , as well as approximately 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) of the road along with surrounding lands and period buildings between Meriam 's Corner and western Lexington are part of Minuteman National Historical Park . There are walking trails with interpretive displays along routes that the colonists might have used that skirted the road , and the Park Service often has personnel ( usually dressed in period dress ) offering descriptions of the area and explanations of the events of the day . A bronze bas relief of Major Buttrick , designed by Daniel Chester French and executed by Edmond Thomas Quinn in 1915 , is in the park , along with French 's Minute Man statue . 
 Four current units of the Massachusetts National Guard units ( 181st Infantry , 182nd Infantry , 101st Engineer Battalion , and 125th Quartermaster Company ) are derived from American units that participated in the Battles of Lexington and Concord . There are only thirty current units of the U.S. Army with colonial roots . 
 Several ships of the United States Navy , including two World War II aircraft carriers , were named in honor of the Battle of Lexington .

The three stamps were first placed on sale in Washington , D.C. and in five Massachusetts cities and towns that played major roles in the Lexington and Concord story : Lexington , Concord , Boston , Cambridge , and Concord Junction ( as West Concord was then known ) . This is not to say that other locations were not involved in the battles .

 The Town of Concord invited 700 prominent U.S. citizens and leaders from the worlds of government , the military , the diplomatic corps , the arts , sciences , and humanities to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the battles . On April 19 , 1975 , as a crowd estimated at 110 @,@ 000 gathered to view a parade and celebrate the Bicentennial in Concord , President Gerald Ford delivered a major speech near the North Bridge , which was televised to the nation . 
 Freedom was nourished in American soil because the principles of the Declaration of Independence flourished in our land . These principles , when enunciated 200 years ago , were a dream , not a reality . Today , they are real . Equality has matured in America . Our inalienable rights have become even more sacred . There is no government in our land without consent of the governed . Many other lands have freely accepted the principles of liberty and freedom in the Declaration of Independence and fashioned their own independent republics . It is these principles , freely taken and freely shared , that have revolutionized the world . The volley fired here at Concord two centuries ago , ' the shot heard round the world ' , still echoes today on this anniversary . 
 President Ford laid a wreath at the base of The Minute Man statue and then respectfully observed as Sir Peter Ramsbotham , the British Ambassador to the United States , laid a wreath at the grave of British soldiers killed in the battle . 
 = William Herschel Telescope = 
 The William Herschel Telescope ( WHT ) is a 4 @.@ 20 @-@ metre ( 165 in ) optical / near @-@ infrared reflecting telescope located at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands , Spain . The telescope , which is named after William Herschel , is part of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes . It is funded by research councils from the United Kingdom , the Netherlands and Spain . 
 At the time of construction in 1987 , the WHT was the third largest single optical telescope in the world . It is currently the second largest in Europe , and was the final telescope constructed by Grubb Parsons in their 150 @-@ year history . 
 The WHT is equipped with a wide range of instruments operating over the optical and near @-@ infrared regimes . These are used by professional astronomers to conduct a wide range of astronomical research . Astronomers using the telescope discovered the first evidence for a supermassive black hole ( Sgr A * ) at the centre of the Milky Way , and made the first optical observation of a gamma @-@ ray burst . 
 = = History = = 
 The WHT was first conceived in the late 1960s , when the 3 @.@ 9 m ( 150 in ) Anglo @-@ Australian Telescope ( AAT ) was being designed . The British astronomical community saw the need for telescopes of comparable power in the northern hemisphere . In particular , there was a need for optical follow @-@ up of interesting sources in the radio surveys being conducted at the Jodrell Bank and Mullard observatories , both located in the UK . 
 The AAT was completed in 1974 , at which point the British Science and Engineering Research Council began planning for a group of three telescopes located in the northern hemisphere ( now known as the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes , ING ) . The telescopes were to be a 1 @.@ 0 m ( 39 in ) ( which became the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope ) , the 2 @.@ 5 m ( 98 in ) Isaac Newton Telescope which was to be moved from its existing site at Herstmonceux Castle , and a 4m class telescope , initially planned as a 4 @.@ 5 m ( 180 in ) . A new site was chosen at an altitude of 2 @,@ 344 m ( 7 @,@ 690 ft ) on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands , that is now the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos . The project was led by the Royal Greenwich Observatory ( <unk> ) , who also operated the telescopes until control passed to an independent ING when the <unk> closed in 1998 . 
 By 1979 the 4 m was on the verge of being scrapped due to a ballooning budget , whilst the aperture had been reduced to 4 @.@ 2 m ( 170 in ) . A panel known as the Tiger Team was convened to reduce the cost ; a re @-@ design cut the price @-@ tag by 45 % . Savings were primarily made by reducing the focal length of the telescope – which allowed the use of a smaller dome – and relocating non @-@ essential functions outside the dome to a simpler ( and thus cheaper ) rectangular annexe . In the same year , the Isaac Newton Telescope was moved to Roque de los Muchachos Observatory , becoming the first of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes . In 1981 the Nederlandse <unk> voor <unk> <unk> ( Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research , NWO ) bought a 20 % stake in the project , allowing the WHT to be given the go @-@ ahead . That year was the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Uranus by William Herschel , and it was decided to name the telescope in his honour . 
 Construction of the telescope was by Grubb Parsons , the last telescope that company produced in its 150 @-@ year history . Work began at their workshop in Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne in 1983 , and the telescope was shipped to La Palma in 1985 ( the two other telescopes of the Isaac Newton Group began operating in 1984 ) . The WHT saw first light on 1 June 1987 ; it was the third largest optical telescope in the world at the time . The total cost of the telescope , including the dome and the full initial suite of instruments , was £ 15M ( in 1984 , equivalent to £ <unk> in 2016 ) ; within budget once inflation is taken into account . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = Optics = = = 
 The telescope consists of a 4 @.@ 20 m ( 165 in ) f / 2 @.@ 5 primary mirror made by Owens @-@ Illinois from <unk> , a zero @-@ expansion glass @-@ ceramic material , and ground by Grubb Parsons . The mirror blank was produced in 1969 as one of a set of four , along with those for the AAT , <unk> and Blanco telescopes , and was purchased for the WHT in 1979 , ten years after it was made . The primary is solid and un @-@ thinned , so no active optics system is required , despite its weight of 16 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 16 @.@ 2 long tons ) . The mirror support cell holds the main mirror on a set of 60 pneumatic cylinders . Even under the most extreme loading ( with the telescope pointing at the horizon , so the mirror is vertical ) the shape of the mirror changes by only 50 nanometres ( 2 @.@ 0 × 10 − 6 in ) ; during normal operation the deformation is much smaller . 
 In its most usual configuration , a 1 @.@ 00 m ( 39 in ) hyperbolic secondary mirror made of <unk> is used to form a Ritchey Chretien f / 11 Cassegrain system with a 15 arcmin field of view . An additional flat fold mirror allows the use of any one of two Nasmyth platforms or two folded Cassegrain stations , each with 5 arcmin fields of view . The telescope sometimes operates in a wide @-@ field prime focus configuration , in which case the secondary is removed and a three element field @-@ correcting lens inserted , which provides an effective f / 2 @.@ 8 focus with a 60 arcmin field of view ( 40 arcmin <unk> ) . Changing between the Cassegrain and Nasmyth foci takes a matter of seconds and may be done during the night ; switching to and from prime focus requires replacing the secondary mirror with a prime focus assembly during daytime ( the two are mounted back @-@ to @-@ back ) which takes around 30 minutes . 
 A <unk> focus was planned as a later addition , to feed an optical interferometer with another telescope , but this was never built . A chopping f / 35 secondary mirror was planned for infrared observations , but was placed on hold by the cost @-@ saving re @-@ design and never implemented . 
 = = = Mount = = = 
 The optical system weighs 79 @,@ 513 kg ( 78 @.@ 257 long tons ) and is manoeuvred on an alt @-@ azimuth mount , with a total moving mass of 186 @,@ 250 kg ( 183 @.@ 31 long tons ) ( plus instruments ) . The BTA @-@ 6 and Multi Mirror Telescope had demonstrated during the 1970s the significant weight ( and therefore cost ) savings which could be achieved by the alt @-@ azimuth design compared to the traditional equatorial mount for large telescopes . However , the alt @-@ azimuth design requires continuous computer control , compensation for field rotation at each focus , and results in a 0 @.@ 2 degree radius blind spot at zenith where the drive motors cannot keep up with sidereal motion ( the drives have a maximum speed of one degree per second in each axis ) . The mount is so smooth and finely balanced that before the drive motors were installed it was possible to move the then 160 long tons ( 160 @,@ 000 kg ) assembly by hand . During closed loop guiding , the mount is capable of an absolute pointing accuracy of 0 @.@ 03 arcseconds . 
 = = = Dome = = = 
 The telescope is housed in an onion @-@ shaped steel dome with an internal diameter of 21 m ( 69 ft ) , manufactured by Brittain Steel . The telescope mount is located on a cylindrical concrete pier so that the centre of rotation is 13 @.@ 4 m ( 44 ft ) above ground level , which lifts the telescope above ground @-@ layer air turbulence for better seeing . A conventional up @-@ down 6m @-@ wide shutter with wind @-@ blind , several large vents with extractor fans for thermal control , and a 35 @-@ tonne ( 34 @-@ long @-@ ton ) capacity crane ( used for moving the primary mirror e.g. for <unk> ) are all incorporated . The size and shape of the shutter allow observations down to 12 ° above the horizon , which corresponds to an airmass of 4 @.@ 8 . The total moving mass of the dome is 320 tonnes ( 310 long tons ) , which is mounted on top of a three @-@ storey cylindrical building . The dome was designed to minimise wind stresses and can support up to its own weight again in ice during inclement weather . The dome and telescope rest on separate sets of foundations ( driven 20 metres ( 66 ft ) down into the volcanic basalt ) , to prevent vibrations caused by dome rotation or wind stresses on the building affecting the telescope pointing . 
 Attached to the dome is a three @-@ storey rectangular building which houses the telescope control room , computer room , kitchen etc . Almost no human presence is required inside the dome , which means the environmental conditions can be kept very stable . As a result , the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing . This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant . Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos , its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel large enough to accommodate the mirrors from any other telescope on the mountain . As a result , all of the other telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising ( with the exception of the Gran <unk> Canarias , which has its own plant ) .

 The WHT is operated by the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes ( ING ) , together with the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope and <unk> Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope . Offices and administration are located an hour 's drive away in Santa Cruz de La Palma , the island 's capital . Funding is provided by the UK 's Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC , 65 % ) , the Netherlands ' Nederlandse <unk> voor <unk> <unk> ( NWO , 25 % ) and Spain 's Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias ( IAC , 10 % ) ( 2008 values ) . Telescope time is distributed in proportion to this funding , although Spain receives an additional 20 % allocation in return for use of the observatory site . Five percent of observing time is further reserved for astronomers of other nationalities . As a competitive research telescope , the WHT is heavily oversubscribed , typically receiving applications for three to four times as much observing time as is actually available . 
 The vast majority of observations are carried out in visitor mode i.e. with the investigating astronomer physically present at the telescope . A shift to service mode operations ( those carried out by observatory staff on behalf of astronomers who do not travel to the telescope ) has been considered and rejected on scientific and operational grounds . 
 = = Instruments = = 
 The WHT is equipped with a wide range of scientific instruments , providing astronomers with the capabilities to conduct a large variety of scientific investigations . As of 2010 , the current common @-@ user instrumentation is : 
 <unk> 
 Auxiliary @-@ port <unk> – optical imager / spectrograph , with <unk> and narrow @-@ band imaging over an 8 ' field and low @-@ resolution ( R < 900 ) spectroscopy . Permanently mounted at one of the broken @-@ Cassegrain foci .

 <unk> 
 Prime Focus Imaging Platform – wide field optical camera , with <unk> and narrow @-@ band imaging over a 16 ' field . Mounted at prime focus . 
 In addition the WHT is a popular telescope for single @-@ purpose visitor instruments , which in recent years have included <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , PNS , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Visitor instruments can use either the Cassegrain focus or one of the Nasmyth foci . 
 A common set of calibration lamps ( Helium and Neon arc lamps , and a Tungsten flat @-@ field lamp ) are permanently mounted at one of the broken @-@ Cassegrain foci , and can be used for any of the other instruments . 
 The ISIS and <unk> are the workhorses of the WHT , and approximately two @-@ thirds of all time awarded is for these two instruments . 
 = = Scientific research = = 
 Astronomers use the WHT to conduct scientific research across most branches of observational astronomy , including solar system science , galactic astronomy , extragalactic astronomy and cosmology . Most of the instruments are designed to be useful for a range of different research . 
 The WHT has been used to make many significant new discoveries . Some of the more notable include the first evidence of a supermassive black hole ( Sgr A * ) at the centre of the Milky Way ( in 1995 ) and the first optical observation of a gamma @-@ ray burst ( GRB 970228 ) ( in 1997 ) . 
 Since the mid @-@ 1990s the WHT has faced increasing competition from newer 8 @-@ to @-@ 10 m ( 310 @-@ to @-@ 390 in ) telescopes . Nevertheless , a wide range of research continues to be done with the telescope . In recent years ( as of 2010 ) this has included : 
 The <unk> project , an integral field spectrograph survey of nearby elliptical and lenticular galaxies ( 2001 – 2010 ) 
 The first spectrum of an asteroid which subsequently hit the Earth , 2008 <unk> ( 2009 ) 
 The first spectrum of Hanny 's Voorwerp ( 2009 ) 
 The discovery that diffuse interstellar bands do not originate in circumstellar envelopes ( 2008 ) 
 Confirmation that WASP @-@ 3b is an extrasolar planet ( 2008 ) 
 High @-@ resolution spectra of the first known double supernova , SN 2006jc ( 2007 ) 
 = = Future developments = = 
 The upcoming generation of extremely large telescopes ( ELTs ) will require sophisticated adaptive optics in order to be used to their full capability . Because the WHT has an advanced adaptive optics system already operating , it is receiving attention from the various ELT programs . The European Southern Observatory 's European @-@ ELT ( E @-@ ELT ) project has begun a programme to utilise the WHT as a test @-@ bed for its adaptive optics system , and will receive several nights per year for on @-@ sky testing . The project involves construction of new optical experiments at one of the Nasmyth foci , and is called <unk> . <unk> will demonstrate the multi @-@ object adaptive optics ( <unk> ) required for the EAGLE instrument on the E @-@ ELT . 
 The UK 's STFC ( originally the major financial contributor ) has gradually reduced its funding for the ING telescopes over a number of years . Some of this funding shortfall has been made up by other partners increasing their contributions , and some by efficiency savings and cutbacks . As a result , the shares of observing time will become UK 33 % , Netherlands 28 % , Spain 34 % and 5 % for any nationality . A new development , started in 2010 , is the development of a new wide @-@ field multi @-@ object spectroscopy facility ( <unk> ) , being developed by a UK @-@ led consortium involving major contributions from the Netherlands , Spain , France , and Italy , which is expected to be in place by the end of 2017 . <unk> will provide medium @-@ high resolution spectroscopy in the visible ( 360 @-@ 950 nm ) range for up to 1000 simultaneous targets over a 2 degree field of view , and is currently expected to operate through to at least 2023 . 
 = Salon Kitty = 
 Salon Kitty was a high @-@ class Berlin brothel used by the Nazi intelligence service , the Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ) , for espionage purposes during World War II . 
 Created in the early 1930s , the salon was taken over by SS general Reinhard Heydrich and his subordinate Walter Schellenberg in 1939 . The brothel was managed by Kitty Schmidt throughout its entire existence who was the original owner . The plan was to seduce top German dignitaries , foreign visitors as well as diplomats with alcohol and women so they would disclose secrets or express their honest opinions on Nazi @-@ related topics and individuals . Notable guests included Heydrich himself , Joseph Dietrich , Galeazzo Ciano and Joseph Goebbels . The building housing the salon was destroyed in an air raid in 1942 and the project quickly lost its importance . Salon Kitty has been the inspiration or subject to many brothels featured in films involving Nazi espionage . 
 = = History = = 
 In the 1930s , " Salon Kitty " was a high @-@ class brothel located at 11 <unk> in Charlottenburg , a wealthy district of Berlin . Its usual clientele included German dignitaries , foreign diplomats , top industrialist , high @-@ ranking civil servants and senior Nazi Party members . Its madame was Katharina Zammit , better known as Kitty Schmidt , who had been running the brothel since its creation . 
 = = = Nazi takeover = = = 
 Schmidt had secretly been sending money to British banks with fleeing refugees ever since the Nazis took power in Germany in January 1933 . When she eventually tried to leave the country on 28 June 1939 , Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ) agents arrested her at the Dutch border and took her to Gestapo headquarters . Once there she was seen by Walter Schellenberg , who at that time worked in the counter @-@ intelligence department of the SD . He gave her an ultimatum : cooperate with the Nazis or be sent to a concentration camp . 
 The idea to use Salon Kitty for espionage purposes came from Reinhard Heydrich , a leading SS general and police chief within Nazi Germany . Instead of infiltrating the brothel , Schellenberg decided to take it over altogether . He converted the basement into a " workshop " where five operators could make transcriptions of conversations from the love @-@ making room . The nine rooms of the salon were also lavishly expanded and renovated to the highest standards of the 1930s . The idea was to entertain prominent guests with wine and women , so they would disclose secrets or talk about their real opinions to ensure their support could be relied upon . 
 = = = Girls of Salon Kitty = = = 
 For the purpose of espionage , the SS started looking for young women to work in the brothel . In a circular deemed " top secret " , Schellenberg asked administrative offices in Berlin for assistance . The requirement profile read : " Wanted are women and girls , who are intelligent , multilingual , nationalistically minded and furthermore man @-@ crazy " ( <unk> werden Frauen und Mädchen , die intelligent , <unk> , <unk> <unk> und <unk> <unk> sind . ) . Berlin 's <unk> ( " vice squad " ) arrested dozens of Berlin prostitutes and selected the most beautiful and sexually attractive as potential agents to work at Salon Kitty . Among other things , they were trained to recognize military uniforms , and to glean secrets from innocuous conversation . They were not told about the microphones , but had to make a report after every encounter . The ladies all had their particular attractions and had been trained to satisfy even the discerning customers . Historian Paul Roland further notes that the women who entertained members of the Nazi elite , however , were respected ladies of Berlin 's high society who were given no allowances for their " contributions " and were nearly all married to men of good financial means . 
 In March 1940 , Schmidt was told to continue business as if nothing had happened , except now she had a special book of twenty additional girls she should only show to certain clients . If a customer used the phrase " I come from Rothenburg " , she was instructed to show him the book , allow him make his decision and call for the girl he had selected . The girl would then spend the night with the guest and depart later .
