 = Port of Ploče = 
 The Port of Ploče ( Croatian : Luka Ploče ) is a seaport in Ploče , Croatia , near the mouth of the Neretva river on the Adriatic Sea coast . It was formally opened in 1945 after a railway was built as a supply route to connect the site with industrial facilities in the Sarajevo and Mostar areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina , which was then part of Yugoslavia . As of 2010 , it ranked as the second largest cargo port in Croatia — after the Port of Rijeka — with a cargo throughput of 4 @.@ 5 million tonnes , consisting mostly of general cargo and bulk cargo , including 20 @,@ 420 twenty @-@ foot equivalent units ( TEUs ) . In 2008 , the Port of Ploče recorded 2 @,@ 555 ship arrivals . It is managed by the Port of Ploče Authority . 
 The Port of Ploče recorded a steady growth and development from 1945 , but suffered a sharp decline between 1991 and 1996 due to the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War . In the late 2000s , Luka Ploče d.d. , the primary concessionaire of the Port of Ploče , embarked on an ambitious investment plan , aiming for a substantial increase in the volume of port operations . Funding was secured in 2007 , and Luka Ploče d.d. plans to invest € 91 million in port infrastructure and around € 180 million in port equipment by 2014 . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1936 , it was decided to develop the Port of Ploče , as the site at the mouth of the Neretva on the Adriatic coast represented the natural outlet for the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina , which was then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . Preparations included the construction of a railway between Metković and Ploče , as an extension of the railway from Sarajevo . The railway was completed in 1942 , three years after construction of the port commenced in 1939 . The works were delayed by the onset of World War II , but they were intensified in 1945 after modernization of the Sarajevo – Ploče narrow gauge railway . 
 The port officially started operating on July 15 , 1945 , handling imports of coal and cereal and exports of bauxite and timber . The railway was rebuilt to standard gauge in 1966 , and electric traction was installed in 1969 to increase the port 's throughput , which reached one million tonnes within a few years . Development of the port was sustained until 1991 , when the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War brought about a five @-@ year decline , affecting not only the port 's accessibility but also its primary market . In 1996 , Croatia and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the Ploče Agreement , regulating unhindered passage of goods between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Port of Ploče and stipulating that such cargo should be duty @-@ free . Enforcement of the agreement is related to the duration of the Neum Agreement . 
 In 2006 , Luka Ploče d.d. started developing a new bulk cargo terminal , a new container terminal and a distribution center , implementing IT systems throughout port facilities and operations , and enhancing logistical support to increase the competitiveness of the Ploče transport route . Funding of € 91 million was approved on November 20 , 2006 , consisting of a € 58 @.@ 8 million loan from the World Bank , a € 11 @.@ 2 million loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a provision of € 21 million by Croatia . By August 2010 , € <unk> of the total had been spent , and the new container terminal was opened . 
 The Port of Ploče Authority was established by the Government of Croatia on February 13 , 1997 , to oversee construction , maintenance , administration , protection and promotion of the Port of Ploče . Since 1998 , the general and bulk cargo operations of the port have been operated by Luka Ploče d.d. and development has resumed . In 2009 , after negotiations with the Port of Ploče Authority , Luka Ploče was granted a 32 @-@ year extension of the concession contract for the cargo handling operations of the port . The contract requires the port authority to improve port infrastructure and Luka Ploče to invest in new cargo handling equipment . The Croatian government considers the Port of Ploče to be one of six seaports of national interest .

 The Port of Ploče is located on the Adriatic Sea coast in the area of the Neretva river . Its facilities include terminals and other structures in Ploče and in Metković , which lies on the Neretva approximately 20 kilometres ( 12 miles ) inland to the east of Ploče . The Port of Ploče is at the southern terminus of Pan @-@ European transport corridor V , branch C , representing a maritime extension of the rail and road routes leading to and from the Ploče area . These routes include modern roads such as : the Croatian A1 motorway , accessed via the <unk> and <unk> , forming part of European route E65 and connecting Zagreb , Budapest and Vienna ; and the Bosnia and Herzegovina A1 and the planned Croatian A10 motorways , which are parts of European route E73 . All the port 's quays are linked by tracks connected to a single @-@ track railway to Mostar , Sarajevo , Osijek and further north towards Budapest . 
 The port comprises several terminals : 
 General Cargo Terminal – handles food , cattle food , cotton , tobacco and industrial products ; it has processing , packaging and storage facilities , six berths and a 9 @.@ 2 @-@ metre ( 30 ft ) draught . 
 Bulk Cargo Terminal – handles coal , iron ore , pig iron , scrap iron , phosphates and cinder ; it has storage facilities , three berths and a 13 @-@ metre ( 43 ft ) draught , allowing transshipment of 15 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 33 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 lb ) of cargo per day .

 The Port of Ploče is the second largest cargo seaport in Croatia , mostly serving Bosnia and Herzegovina , along with some local and regional users . The port is administered by the Port of Ploče Authority , with Luka Ploče d.d. as the primary concessionaire . Subcontractors that operate the liquid cargo terminal facilities are <unk> <unk> <unk> d.o.o. and Luka Ploče <unk> d.o.o. , while passenger and vehicle transit is handled by Jadrolinija . Jadrolinija ferries sail between Ploče and <unk> on the Pelješac peninsula and the <unk> state road . In 2009 , the ferry line carried annual average daily traffic of 143 vehicles . During summer the volume increased to 383 vehicles on average . 
 In 2008 , the Port of Ploče recorded 2 @,@ 555 ship arrivals , 106 in Metković and the rest in Ploče . In the same period , the Passenger Terminal recorded 145 @,@ 945 passenger arrivals and departures . As of September 2011 , the Director of the Port Authority is Tomislav <unk> .

 As of September 2011 , only part of the development plan defined by the Port of Ploče Authority in 2006 is completed — the new container terminal opened in 2010 , but construction of the new bulk cargo terminal , originally scheduled for completion by 2010 , is now planned for 2011 – 2014 . The 5 million tonne @-@ per @-@ year bulk cargo terminal will expand the port area by 20 hectares ( 49 acres ) . The new bulk cargo terminal is planned to accommodate ships with a draught of up to 18 @.@ 5 metres ( 61 feet ) , and 200 @,@ 000 tonnes deadweight ( DWT ) , i.e. Capesize vessels . It aims to attract large quantities of transport for the ArcelorMittal , <unk> , Birač Zvornik and <unk> industrial plants in Bosnia and Herzegovina , which are the main users of the port . The ArcelorMittal plant in Zenica alone is expected to ship 1 @.@ 5 million tonnes of ore and coal , as it would save US $ 15 – 20 million in shipping costs . 
 Further investments beyond construction of the new terminal were planned since 2007 for bulk cargo terminal equipment worth € <unk> , cargo terminal equipment worth € 11 million , replacement of equipment in pre @-@ 2007 port facilities valued at € 26 million and reconstruction of the liquid cargo terminal worth € 70 million . These investments were originally scheduled for 2007 – 2014 , but the pace of development is slower than expected , and delays of a year to two had been observed by 2010 . The required superstructure is planned to be funded through build @-@ operate @-@ transfer contracts and public – private partnerships . The investments made since 2007 and those planned as of 2011 are aimed at increasing the port 's throughput from 8 to 10 million tonnes of cargo per year . 
 = Boom Town ( Doctor Who ) = 
 " Boom Town " is the eleventh episode of the first series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who , the episode was first broadcast on BBC One on 4 June 2005 . It was written by executive producer Russell T Davies and directed by Joe Ahearne . 
 In the episode , alien time traveller the Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) and his companions Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) and Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) travel to modern @-@ day Cardiff and meet up with Rose 's boyfriend , Mickey Smith ( Noel Clarke ) . There , they discover that a recent enemy , a Slitheen named Margaret Blaine ( Annette Badland ) , survived the events of " Aliens of London " / " World War Three " and is willing to destroy the planet to ensure her freedom . 
 " Boom Town " was a replacement episode for a story that was to be written by Paul Abbott , but he had to abandon the script because he had other commitments . Davies decided to write a different story centred on bringing Badland 's character back from the fourth and fifth episodes in the series , as he had enjoyed her performances . Primarily , Davies wanted to explore the consequences of the Doctor 's actions and question whether he had the right to sentence an enemy to death . The episode was also intended to showcase Cardiff , where the revived Doctor Who series is made , and where the episode was filmed in February 2005 . " Boom Town " was watched by 7 @.@ 68 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received mixed reviews from critics . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Doctor lands the TARDIS in Cardiff , using the energy of the Cardiff Rift to recharge the engines . Rose has Mickey bring her passport to the TARDIS , and together with the Doctor and Jack Harkness , they go to lunch . At lunch , the Doctor spots a newspaper article showing Margaret Blaine , a Slitheen , has become Cardiff 's new mayor . The four track down and capture Margaret to find out what she is doing there after their previous encounter . The Doctor observes Blaine 's scale model plans for a new nuclear power plant , but identifies that it is purposely flawed to cause a meltdown that would open the Cardiff Rift and destroy the Earth . He also discovers the model contains a functioning <unk> waveform macro @-@ kinetic extrapolator that Margaret would have used to flee the Earth . The Doctor decides to take Margaret back to her home planet of <unk> , but she reveals that she has received a death sentence there and will be executed upon returning . The Doctor agrees to her final request to accompany her to a dinner meal . Margaret makes several half @-@ hearted attempts to kill the Doctor but he easily avoids them . She then tries to play on the Doctor 's sympathies , asking him to take her to another planet instead . 
 Back at the TARDIS , Jack begins integrating the extrapolator into the TARDIS to speed up the engine recharge . Rose and Mickey hang out together , and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him , and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end , but before she can answer him , loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area . Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift . The Doctor , Margaret , Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift , rupturing it . Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer , and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator . The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console , bathing Margaret in light . While she is captivated by the light , Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator . As the console closes , they find that Margaret 's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg . The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her . The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family . Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye , and runs out to look for him in the nearby area , but he is gone . Rose returns to the TARDIS , clearly distraught , and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey , but she declines , saying that he deserves better .

 Continuing the Bad Wolf story arc of the series , the nuclear power station is named " <unk> <unk> " , which means " bad wolf " in the Welsh language . This was the first reference to be explicitly addressed by the Doctor and Rose . The Rift was established earlier in the series in " The Unquiet Dead " , and the Doctor <unk> there again in " Utopia " ( 2007 ) . The place where the TARDIS lands in Roald Dahl Plass develops unusual properties , as seen in the spin @-@ off series Torchwood . Rose mentions that she and the Doctor have been to Justicia , which is the star system that they visit in the New Series Adventures novel The Monsters Inside by Stephen Cole . Blaine says that as a child she was threatened with being fed to venom grubs ; these creatures appeared in the First Doctor serial The Web Planet ( 1965 ) .

 According to an interview with executive producer and episode writer Russell T Davies in Doctor Who Magazine , this episode was originally offered to his friend and former colleague , the critically acclaimed and award @-@ winning scriptwriter Paul Abbott . Abbott accepted and submitted a storyline , revealing that Rose had been bred by the Doctor as an experiment in creating a perfect companion . The episode was titled " The Void " . However , Abbot had to abandon the project due to other commitments . Davies wrote " Boom Town " instead , bringing back Badland as Blaine due to her performance in " Aliens of London " and " World War Three " being " brilliant " , though she had few lines . The actor playing Mr Cleaver , William Thomas , had previously appeared as Martin the undertaker in the 1988 classic series story Remembrance of the Daleks . This made him the first performer to appear in both the original and current run of Doctor Who . He later played Geraint Cooper , the father of Gwen Cooper , in the Doctor Who spinoff series Torchwood . 
 Davies stated that he originally intended to call this episode " Dining with Monsters " . He joked that a much better name for this episode would be " What should we do with Margaret ? " Davies intended the episode to be a character piece exploring whether the Doctor had the authority to take someone to their death sentence , as well as showing the consequences of the Doctor 's actions the last time he met Margaret . The storyline was fitting for Eccleston 's war @-@ torn Doctor . The consequences of the Doctor 's lifestyle is also explored through Rose 's boyfriend Mickey , who has been forced to move on because she is not around . The resolution is a deliberate deus ex machina , regressing Margaret so she can start anew , although Davies remarked that the resolution did not come completely out of nowhere as the TARDIS ' psychic link had been already established . 
 Much of " Boom Town " was filmed on Cardiff Bay , with one scene in particular in front of the Millennium Centre , in February 2005 . The Doctor is seen reading the Welsh newspaper Western Mail ; Davies stated that he wanted to incorporate Welsh culture because the series is made in Wales and contains a lot of Welsh crew members . He also wanted to show off how beautiful the area could be . The night shoot of Rose and Mickey in front of the water tower at Roald Dahl Plass had to be extended to two nights because it was below the temperature at which the fountain automatically shuts off . The dinner scene between the Doctor and Margaret was filmed in January 2005 at the Cardiff restaurant Bistro 10 before the rest of the episode was filmed ; Eccleston filmed the scene while Piper and Barrowman were filming scenes for " The Empty Child " . This was due to scheduling conflicts with Badland . Some of the schedule was also rearranged because of the death of Piper 's uncle , resulting in her and Eccleston being replaced by doubles during some scenes near the end of the episode . The egg Margaret turns into was a reused prop from the second episode , " The End of the World " .

 " Boom Town " was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 4 June 2005 on BBC One . The episode received overnight ratings of 7 @.@ 13 million viewers , a 36 @.@ 95 % audience share and an increase over the past two weeks . When final ratings were calculated , the figure rose to 7 @.@ 68 million . It received an Appreciation Index of 82 . 
 SFX described " Boom Town " as a " format @-@ breaking episode " . The reviewer acknowledged that it " certainly misfires on some levels , and leaves various elements underdeveloped " , but praised the moral dilemma , including the dinner scene . However , the conclusion with Margaret being reverted to an egg was seen as a " little too handy and provides the Doctor with a moral get @-@ out clause " , and the Rose and Mickey subplot was called " weak " due to the lack of evidence he and Rose were ever close . Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode a grade of B + , writing that it " sacrifices a bit of plot and logic " for a good exploration of the characters and plot threads . He praised the dialogue and Murray Gold 's score . Digital Spy 's Dek Hogan was more negative , feeling that it " really didn 't work " , calling bringing back Margaret a " poor idea " , and he criticised the pace for dragging too much . 
 In 2013 , Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times particularly praised Badland and the dinner scene , though he described the whole episode as a " peculiar short @-@ story , a low @-@ cal filler sandwiched between the dramatic juggernauts of Steven Moffat 's Doctor Who debut and Russell T Davies 's dazzling finale . " The A.V. Club reviewer Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a grade of B , noting that it required more suspension of belief than usual . He felt that the plot was included out of necessity while the episode was more focused on character moments , and that this did not work as well as " Father 's Day " because Margaret 's fate was " less clearly motivated . " On the other hand , Wilkins called Rose and Mickey 's subplot the most effectively handled part of " Boom Town " . In Who Is the Doctor , a guide to the revived series , author Robert Smith ? called the episode " highly entertaining " and " thoughtful " , despite not being well @-@ plotted with an " unsatisfying " deus ex machina ending . He praised the character material and comedy . His coauthor Graeme Burk was less enthusiastic , describing it as " nothing more " than a " fun romp " . He felt that there were many good scenes but " no real story " , and pointed out how the moral dilemma did not matter because the decision does not end up being in the Doctor 's hands . 
 = Lactifluus volemus = 
 Lactifluus volemus , formerly known as Lactarius volemus , is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae . It is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere , in temperate regions of Europe , North America and Asia as well as some subtropical and tropical regions of Central America and Asia . A mycorrhizal fungus , its fruit bodies grow on the ground at the base of various species of trees from summer to autumn , either individually or in groups . It is valued as an edible mushroom , and is sold in markets in Asia . Several other Lactifluus mushrooms resemble L. volemus , such as the closely related edible species L. corrugis , but these can be distinguished by differences in distribution , visible morphology , and microscopic characteristics . L. volemus produces a white spore print and has roughly spherical spores about 7 – 8 micrometres in diameter . 
 The colour of the L. volemus mushroom varies from apricot to tawny , and the cap may be up to 11 cm ( 4 1 ⁄ 2 in ) wide . The pale golden yellow gills on the underside of the cap are closely spaced and sometimes forked . One of the mushroom 's most distinctive features is the large amount of latex ( " milk " ) that it exudes when the gills are damaged , leading to the common names weeping milk cap and voluminous @-@ latex milky . It also has a distinctive fishy smell , which does not affect the taste . The fruit bodies have been chemically analysed and found to contain several sterols related to ergosterol , some of which are unique to this species . The mushroom also contains a natural rubber that has been chemically characterized . Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Lactifluus volemus represents several species or subspecies , rather than a single taxon . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The first mention of Lactifluus volemus in the scientific literature was in Carl Linnaeus 's 1753 Species Plantarum , under the name Agaricus lactifluus . In 1821 , Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries called it Agaricus volemus in his Systema Mycologicum . In this work he proposed a grouping of related species ( called a tribus , or tribe ) within the genus Agaricus , which he named Galorrheus . Fries later recognised Lactarius as a distinct genus in his 1838 Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici , citing Galorrheus as a synonym . Although Linnaeus had published the species before Fries , Fries 's name is sanctioned and thus has nomenclatural priority . In 1871 Paul Kummer raised most of Fries 's tribes to generic rank , and so renamed the species Galorrheus volemus . The variety L. volemus var. <unk> was identified by Charles Horton Peck in 1879 , but is now classified as a separate species , L. corrugis . In 1891 , Otto Kuntze moved the species into Lactifluus , which was afterwards long considered a synonym of Lactarius but confirmed as a separate genus through molecular phylogenetics in 2008 and subsequent taxonomical rearrangements within the family Russulaceae . 
 Another historical synonym is Lactarius lactifluus , used by Lucien Quélet in 1886 , a renaming based on Linnaeus 's Agaricus lactifluus . Lactarius <unk> , reported by Hua @-@ An Wen and Jian @-@ Zhe Ying to be a new species from China in 2005 , was synonymised two years later with L. volemus . 
 The specific epithet " volemus " is derived from the Latin vola , meaning " the hollow of the hand " , suggestive of Fries 's reference to the large amount of latex " flowing enough to fill the hand " . Common names for L. volemus include the weeping milk cap , the tawny milkcap , the orange @-@ brown milky , the voluminous @-@ latex milky , the lactarius orange , the fishy milkcap , and the apricot milk cap . In the West Virginian mountains of the United States , the mushroom is called a " leatherback " or a " <unk> " . The latter name may originate from its German name <unk> . 
 = = Phylogeny = = 
 Lactifluus volemus was the type species of the section Dulces in subgenus Lactarius , and is currently classified in Lactifluus section Lactifluus . The group around this L. volemus includes species with a dry cap , abundant latex , and a white or pale cream spore print . Because the closely related L. corrugis has overlapping morphological characters , including similar colouration in the cap and stem , it has been difficult to reliably distinguish between the two species . The difficulty in discerning the two is exacerbated by the fact that both species have several colour forms : Japanese specimens of L. volemus may have a red cap , a yellow cap with a long stem , or a velvet @-@ like surface texture ; the caps of L. corrugis may be either red , commonly rust @-@ coloured . In 2005 , Japanese researchers clarified the relationships between these two species and others in section Dulces using molecular phylogenetics , and by comparing differences in fatty acid composition , morphology , and taste . The colour variants group phylogenetically into different subclades , suggesting that they might better be considered as " different species , subspecies , or varieties " . A 2010 molecular study of L. volemus of northern Thailand found that 79 tested specimens could be divided into 18 distinct phylogenetic species ; six of these were described as new species : Lactifluus acicularis , L. <unk> , L. <unk> , L. <unk> , L. pinguis and L. <unk> .

 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The fruit body of Lactifluus volemus has a fleshy and firm cap with a velvety or smooth surface and a shape that changes with maturity : it starts off convex , with edges curved inwards , then later grows flat with a depression in the middle . With a typical diameter of 5 to 11 cm ( 2 – 4 1 ⁄ 2 in ) , its colour ranges from apricot to tawny . The cap colouration , however , is somewhat variable , as has been noted in Asian , European , and North American specimens . The stem , whose height varies between 4 and 12 cm ( 1 1 ⁄ 2 and 5 in ) , and which is typically between 1 and 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 and 0 @.@ 6 in ) thick , has a slightly lighter colouration than the cap . It is firm , with a velvety or smooth surface that sometimes has depressions running longitudinally up and down its length . The gills are adnate to slightly decurrent , brittle , narrow , quite closely spaced and sometimes forked . Normally a pale golden yellow colour , the gills turn brown when bruised . Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae , short gills that do not extend to the stem . The flesh is whitish and firm . The mushroom smells somewhat fishy ; one source suggests the odour is " like a dead shad , which anglers will tell you is probably the most malodorous freshwater fish " . The odour is concentrated when the fruit bodies are dried . One of the mushroom 's most distinctive features is the abundant latex , so plentiful that a small nick on the gills will cause it to " weep " the milky substance . The latex tends to impart brown stains on whatever it contacts .

 The spore print is whitish . The spores are roughly spherical , translucent ( hyaline ) , and typically measure 7 @.@ 5 – 10 @.@ 0 by 7 @.@ 5 – 9 @.@ 0 µm . The spore surface is reticulate — covered with ridges that form a complete network . The ridges are up to 0 @.@ 8 µm high and have conspicuous projections up to 1 @.@ 2 µm high . The spore @-@ bearing cells of the hymenium , the basidia , are club @-@ shaped , hyaline , four @-@ spored , and have dimensions of 40 – 62 by 7 @.@ 2 – 10 @.@ 4 µm . Interspersed among the basidia are sterile cells called cystidia . The pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the side of a gill ) are roughly spindle- to club @-@ shaped , and measure 48 – 145 by 5 – 13 µm . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the edge of a gill ) may be spindle- , club- , or awl @-@ shaped ( <unk> ) , or intermediate in between these forms , and measure 27 – 60 by 5 – 7 µm . Additionally , there are cystidia present on both the surface of the cap and the stem . If a drop of ferric sulphate ( used as a chemical test in mushroom identification ) is applied to the mushroom flesh , it will immediately stain dark bluish @-@ green . 
 = = = Varieties = = = 
 The variety Lactifluus volemus var. flavus was described by Alexander H. Smith and Lexemuel Ray Hesler in their 1979 monograph of North American Lactarius species . This rare variety , found in the southeastern United States ( ranging from South Carolina to Florida and extending west to Texas ) , has a cap that stays yellow throughout its development . It also has slightly smaller spores than the regular variety : 6 @.@ 5 – 9 @.@ 0 by 6 – 8 µm . Some authors have considered the rarely collected L. volemus var. <unk> , found in central and southern Europe , to be a distinct variety distinguished from the common variety by a darker reddish @-@ brown cap and a swollen stem . This assessment is not universally accepted , possibly because it falls within the range of morphological variation shown by the main variety . L. volemus var. asiaticus was named in 2004 based on Vietnamese specimens ; associating with Khasi pine ( Pinus <unk> ) , it has small , dull brown , velvety fruit bodies . In general , little taxonomical significance has been ascribed to the several varieties of L. volemus that have been proposed . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Lactifluus volemus is closely related to L. corrugis , and generally similar in appearance . L. corrugis usually has more surface wrinkles , darker gills , weaker or absent scent , and less orange colouration ; however , intermediate colour forms can be found . The two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics : L. corrugis has larger spores — typically 10 @.@ 4 – 12 @.@ 8 by 9 @.@ 6 – 11 @.@ 8 µm — with a coarser surface reticulum , and larger pleurocystidia . The species Lactifluus <unk> is closely related , but has more crowded gills , while L. <unk> can only be reliably distinguished from L. volemus by microscopic characteristics : the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute , and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller . Both L. <unk> and L. <unk> are known only from Papua New Guinea . Lactifluus <unk> also resembles L. volemus , but differs in having widely spaced gills , and spores that lack surface reticulations . 
 Some species of the genus Lactarius are also similar : The tropical African Lactarius <unk> has a superficial resemblance to L. volemus , but the former species , in addition to its African distribution , can be identified by its cinnamon @-@ brown spore print — unique in the Russulaceae . Lactarius <unk> is also similar to L. volemus , but lacks the fishy odour , has a dull yellow @-@ orange to bright golden orange cap , narrow gills , and a white latex that does not change colour .

 Despite the unappealing fishy scent that develops after the mushroom is picked , Lactifluus volemus is edible and recommended for culinary usage , though , typical of milk caps , it has a slightly granular texture that some may find unappetizing . The odor disappears during cooking . The latex only has a mild taste . The species is considered good for novice mushroom hunters to eat , and is best prepared by slow cooking to prevent it from becoming too hard ; specimens that have been rehydrated after having been dried will require longer cooking times to eliminate the grainy texture . The mushroom has also been suggested for use in casseroles and thick sauces . Pan frying is not a recommended cooking technique , due to the large amounts of latex it exudes . L. volemus is one of several species of milk caps that are sold in rural markets in Yunnan Province , China , and it is among the most popular wild edible mushroom species collected for consumption and sale in Nepal . In their 2009 book on milk caps of North America , Bessette and colleagues consider the mushroom " the best @-@ known and most popular edible milk mushroom " in the eastern United States . A Turkish study of the nutritional composition of the fruit bodies concluded that L. volemus is a good source of protein and carbohydrates . 
 = = = Bioactive compounds = = = 
 Fruit bodies contains a unique sterol molecule called <unk> , a derivative of the common fungal sterol ergosterol that may have application in fungal chemotaxonomy . A 2001 study identified a further nine sterols , three of which were previously unknown to science . According to the authors , these types of highly oxygenated compounds — similar to sterols found in marine soft coral and sponges — are rare in fungi . The mushroom also contains volemitol ( D @-@ <unk> @-@ D @-@ <unk> ) , a seven @-@ carbon sugar alcohol first isolated from the species by the French scientist Émile <unk> in 1889 . <unk> occurs as a free sugar in many plant and brown algal species . 
 Due to their natural polyisoprene content ( 1 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 7 % by dry weight of fruit bodies ) , L. volemus fruit bodies can also be used to produce rubber . The chemical structure of rubber from the mushroom consists of a high molecular mass homologue of polyprenol , arranged as a dimethylallyl group , two trans isoprene units , a long sequence of cis <unk> ( between 260 – 300 units ) , terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester . <unk> , the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound trans , trans @-@ <unk> pyrophosphate , and is thought to terminate by esterification of <unk> pyrophosphate . The enzyme isopentenyl @-@ diphosphate delta isomerase has been identified as required for the initiation of rubber synthesis in L. volemus and several other milk cap species . 
 = = Ecology , distribution , and habitat = = 
 Like all milk caps , L. volemus forms ectomycorrhizae , mutually beneficial symbiotic associations with various tree species . In this association , the fungal hyphae grow around the root of the plant and between its cortical cells , but do not actually penetrate them . The hyphae extend outward into the soil , increasing the surface area for absorption to help the plant absorb nutrients from the soil . It is found growing at the base of both coniferous and broad @-@ leaved trees , although it is more common in deciduous woods . It may also sometimes be found in peat moss beds . The fruit bodies , which appear between summer and autumn , are common . They can be found growing solitarily or in groups , and are more abundant in weather that is warm and humid . 
 Fruit bodies can be inhabited by species of <unk> flies , such as <unk> marginata or <unk> <unk> , as well as several species of fungi @-@ dwelling mites . The flies are hosts for the mites in a symbiotic association known as <unk> , whereby the mites are mechanically carried by its host . Mites are small and unable to migrate the relatively long distances between mushrooms without assistance ; the insect hosts , in comparison , are large and can transfer the mites between their preferred feeding habitats . 
 Lactifluus volemus is found in warm temperate regions and as well as some subtropical and tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere . The fungus is widely distributed throughout Europe , although it is in decline in some countries , and has become rare enough in the Netherlands ( and Flanders ) to be considered locally extinct . In the Americas , the northern limit of its distribution reaches southern Canada east of the Great Plains , and the species extends south to the East Coast of the United States and Mexico , and beyond into Central America ( Guatemala ) . It is also known from Asia , including China ( Qinling Mountains , Guizhou Province , and Yunnan Province ) , Japan , India , Korea , Nepal , and Vietnam . Collections have also been made from the Middle East , including Iran and Turkey . 
 = Ullevaal Stadion = 
 Ullevaal Stadion ( Norwegian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) is an all @-@ seater football stadium located in Oslo , Norway . It is the home ground of Vålerenga IF and the Norway national football team , and the site of the Norwegian Cup Final . From its opening in 1926 to 2009 it was the home ground of FK Lyn . With a capacity of approximately 28 @,@ 000 , it is the largest football stadium in Norway . The national stadium is fully owned by the Football Association of Norway ( NFF ) . 
 The stadium opened on 26 September 1926 as the home ground for Lyn and several other local teams . The first international match was played in 1927 , and NFF started gradually purchasing part of the stadium company . The peak attendance dates from 1935 , when 35 @,@ 495 people saw Norway play Sweden . Since 1948 , Ullevaal has hosted the finals of the Norwegian Football Cup , and in 1967 the Japp Stand was completed . A new renovation started with the completion of the single @-@ tier West Stand in 1985 , and continued with the two @-@ tier North and East Stands in 1990 and the South Stand in 1998 . Ullevaal hosted the finals of the UEFA Women 's Euro in 1987 and 1997 . 
 In conjunction with the stadium is the head office of many sports federations , a bandy field , and commercial property including a conference center , hotel and shopping mall . The stadium is located adjacent to Ullevål Stadion Station of the Oslo Metro and the Ring 3 motorway . Plans call to replace the West Stand to increase capacity to 30 @,@ 000 and perhaps add a retractable roof and artificial turf .

 = = = Construction and early years = = = 
 The first suggestions for a stadium at Ullevaal were launched by members of Lyn in 1917 , but not until 1924 was a committee appointed to look into the matter . Lyn had also considered building their stadium at <unk> , Hoff , Tåsen , Frogner , Berg and Marienlyst . The club made an agreement with the tram operator Akersbanerne to purchase land they had acquired as part of the construction of the Sognsvann Line . It was decided that a limited company was to be established , with a share capital of NOK 100 @,@ 000 . Aker Municipality agreed to purchase 30 % and partially pay via access roads and utilities . All sports clubs in Aker were given the right to purchase up to 10 % of the shares , while the rest was to be bought by Lyn . Any costs exceeding the capital was to be paid for through loans and donations . At the same time , Lyn acquired land to build a training field which they would own themselves and was estimated to cost NOK 20 @,@ 000 . Both plans were passed by the club annual meeting on 23 May 1924 . 
 A / S Ullevaal Stadion was founded on 27 January 1925 . The company was owned 73 @.@ 5 % by Lyn , 24 % Aker Municipality and 5 @.@ 1 % by the clubs Ullevaal , Tåsen , Nydalen and Heming . The stadium was built with a running track , allowing the stadium to also be used for track and field , and had a capacity of about 35 @,@ 000 spectators . The stadium cost NOK 416 @,@ 000 . The grand opening was held on 26 September 1926 by Crown Prince Olav . It was followed by a friendly match between a reinforced Lyn and Örgryte IS of Sweden , where Lyn won 5 – 1 . In the opening game , tickets cost NOK 3 for seats , NOK 2 for standing places and NOK 1 on the end stands . The stadium became both the home ground for Lyn and hosted track and field events . The first international match was held on 29 May 1927 and featured Norway losing 0 – 1 against Denmark . The match against Sweden from the Nordic Football Championship 1933 / 36 on 22 September 1935 was held in front of a crowd of 35 @,@ 495 , which still stands as the spectator record . The stadium was served by the Oslo Metro with the opening of the Sognsvann Line in 1934 . In 1938 , a new East Stand ( <unk> ) was opened . 
 The Football Association bought Aker 's share of the stadium during the 1930s , and in 1945 also part of Lyn 's share . From 1948 , the Cup Final was held at Ullevaal , and has been held there since . Other activities held during the first decades included boxing , and a revival meeting hosted by Billy Graham in front of 40 @,@ 000 people in 1955 . In 1960 , NFF bought more shares from Lyn and became the majority shareholder with 50 @.@ 7 % , while Lyn retained 44 @.@ 2 % . The reason was the planned expansion could not receive public grants with such a strong tie to a single club , but the state was willing to give grants to the stadium if it was controlled by the federation . In 1967 , a new South Stand was opened , and the following year NFF moved into offices at the stadium .

 In the early 1980s , the owner company presented plans for an upgraded stadium , which would have capacity for 40 @,@ 000 spectators , of which 25 @,@ 000 would be seated and 15 @,@ 000 would stand . In 1984 , a new pitch was installed . The first renovation was an all @-@ new West Stand , which would be single @-@ tier and have capacity for 8 @,@ 800 spectators , of which 3 @,@ 800 could be seated under a roof . Costs were estimated at NOK 56 million . The costs were covered by Sogn Næringsbygg , who built the stands and then received free ground to build 12 @,@ 000 square meters ( 130 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of commercial real estate . Because of the height , the new stand was met with protests from locals who felt the six @-@ story structure would wreck the idyllic neighborhood . The stand was completed in 1985 . On 14 June 1987 , Ullevaal was the host of the final of the 1987 European Competition for Women 's Football , where Norway beat Sweden 2 – 0 in front of 8 @,@ 408 spectators . 
 [ [ File : | thumb | The West Stand ( right ) from 2014 is the only single @-@ tier stand at Ullevaal after the renovation in 1998 . ] ] Plans for a new two @-@ tier stand to the north and east were presented next . The plans had called for 24 @,@ 500 sitting places in the new and south stands , and 5 @,@ 500 standing places in the west stand . However , in 1989 , the plans were modified , as the FIFA made new rules , requiring that only seating places could be used for international qualification matches from 1992 . It was thereby decided that Ullevaal would become an all @-@ seater . The renovations included a new turf with under @-@ soil heating , luxury boxes , VIP @-@ seating , a section for the Royal Family , new change rooms and 5 @,@ 000 square meters ( 54 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of restaurant and meeting area . The upgrade involved the removal of the running track , making Ullevaal a pure football stadium . 
 Construction of the two stands started after the cup final in November 1989 , and started with the demolishing of the north stand from 1926 and the east stand from 1938 . After construction was completed , Lyn played its first home game on Ullevaal for the season on 13 September 1990 , after having played most of the season in the Second Division at Voldsløkka Stadion . The construction included 32 @,@ 000 square metres ( 340 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of commercial properties built beneath the stands . Total investment costs for the new stands and commercial area was NOK 350 million , of which NOK 100 million was for the stands . Plans for a NOK 40 @-@ million underground squash court were discarded . 
 = = = NFF and Lyn dispute = = = 
 In 1993 , Lyn was in deep financial difficulties after having been promoted to the Premier League after the 1991 season . To create additional liquidity , the club sold its 44 % share in Ullevaal to the Football Association for NOK 4 @.@ 4 million in January 1993 . At the same time , NFF bought the 5 @.@ 1 % stake owned by the other clubs , making NFF the sole owner of the stadium . In October , the limited company Lyn Fotball AS was founded to take over the elite football teams in Lyn . At the same time , the club announced that it planned to purchase back their shares in Ullevaal Stadion , by letting the club take up a loan . 
 In November , Lyn stated that they wanted to purchases the shares in Ullevaal from NFF , who stated that they were now worth NOK 10 million . NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares . NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors . The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team , including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup , to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals , thus quickly eliminating the stadium 's debt . NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club , and that this should be reflected in the share value . In March 1994 , Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK 4 @.@ 4 million plus interest . 
 In May , it was stated that the matter would not be handled in the courts , but instead by the Football Association 's Tribunal , with the possibility to appeal to the Norwegian Confederation of Sports ' Tribunal . This was because FIFA 's regulations forbade a club form suing their own federation . In January 1995 , the tribunal decided that Lyn had the right to purchase the shares for NOK 4 @.@ 4 million plus interest . By February , it became clear that Lyn did not have sufficient liquidity to purchase the shares . In December 1995 , three months before the purchase option became invalid , the club bought back the shares . In 2001 , it became clear that Lyn had given false information about the deal , and that the club had signed an agreement with Lyn Fotball AS which was later criticized by club members as a " raid " by the investors to secure the main asset in Lyn . The loan had a high interest rate and had clauses that made a refinancing expensive , it gave the investors a right of pre @-@ emption for the shares , the right for the investors to terminate the load on short notice , and the right for the investors to take over the shares should the club not be able to manage the debt . 
 In February 1996 , Lyn and NFF stated that they had agreed that Lyn would sell their shares in Ullevaal to NFF for about NOK 5 to 6 million , plus support for Lyn 's new training facility at Kringsjå . The parties stated that with the plans for expanding and making new investments in Ullevaal , Lyn 's lack of financial backing would become a hindrance for financing the projects and that the sale would allow Lyn to concentrate on playing football . On 25 March , NFF and Lyn stated the sale was terminated by NFF , because it was considered too lucrative for Lyn by other clubs in Norway . In 1996 , the stadium featured a cross @-@ country skiing event with 5 @,@ 500 spectators . On 12 July 1997 , Ullevaal was the host of the final of the UEFA Women 's Euro 1997 , where Germany beat Italy 2 – 0 in front of 2 @,@ 221 spectators . 
 In 1997 , NFF and Lyn agreed to renovate and expand the stadium . The plans called for new stands which would increase the capacity to 30 @,@ 000 spectators . The size of the field would be reduced by 350 square meters ( 3 @,@ 800 sq ft ) , from 107 by 70 meters ( 117 by 77 yd ) to 105 by 68 meters ( 115 by 74 yd ) to make the stadium more intimate . The new grass would be lowered 130 centimetres ( 51 in ) , allowing two more rows of chairs to be added . The South Stand ( Japp ) would be demolished and a new two @-@ tier stand would be built , in the same style as the northern and eastern stands . This would give three sides two @-@ tier height , although the western stand would remain single @-@ tier . The South Stand received 30 luxury boxes and press quarters for 192 people . The project involved the demolishing of the four light masts and instead installing the lights along the roof . The cost of the whole project was estimated at NOK 300 million . 
 The project also included 44 @,@ 000 square metres ( 470 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of commercial real estate , to be located behind the south stands . Because public grants of about NOK 90 million could only be given to non @-@ profit entities , the ownership of the stadium was split in two . The stands and other core areas of the stadium remained owned by the stadium company , while a separate company was created to own the commercial areas . NFF wanted the profits from the commercial company to go to the stadium company to pay for operating expenses , while Lyn wanted the profits to be paid as dividend to the owners so Lyn could pay interests on their debt . Construction started in January 1998 , after Lyn had lost a court case regarding the dividend structure . 
 The Norwegian Olympic Committee and Confederation of Sports , including the federations for many smaller sports , chose to move to Ullevaal and establish their offices in conjunction with the stadium , in <unk> located at the south side . The Norwegian Football Museum was established and received 250 square metres ( 2 @,@ 700 sq ft ) in the southern stand building . 
 During construction in 1998 , Lyn and the national team played their games at Bislett Stadion — the home venue for Vålerenga — while Ullevaal was being rebuilt . Prior to the 1999 season , where Lyn would have to play in the First Division , Lyn applied to play all their matches at Bislett to cut rental costs at Ullevaal . However , this was rejected by the municipality , who owned Bislett , because there was not vacant capacity at Bislett . 
 = = = Vålerenga enters = = = 
 In late 1998 , Vålerenga considered moving their matches to Ullevaal from 1999 . Although they stated that they had a better economic proposal from Ullevaal , the team stayed at Bislett to have more influence on the design of the new stadium that would replace the existing structure . Oslo 's other Premier League team , <unk> Fotball , stated that they had also considered playing at Ullevaal , but wanted to keep the more " intimate feeling " at Voldsløkka Stadion . However , Vålerenga were forced to move some of their 1999 matches to Ullevaal because the dilapidated standards at Bislett . Prior to the 2000 season , Vålerenga signed a three @-@ year contract with Ullevaal , making the national stadium their home . 
 In 2000 , Ullevaal Stadion AS bought the West Stand , including the commercial areas . In March 2001 , NFF gave Lyn a loan for NOK 12 @.@ 5 million , on the condition that if it was not paid back within two years , NFF would take over Lyn 's ownership in the stadium . This made it possible for Lyn to pay their investment company back the debt for the loan , which had increased to this amount in five years , and to purchase the stadium and secure NFF the right of pre @-@ emption . On 4 July 2002 , Lyn and NFF announced that NFF would make a private placement of NOK 27 million in Ullevaal Stadion AS and at the same time terminate Lyn 's debt . In exchange , Lyn 's ownership was reduced to 15 % . 
 In 1998 , Vital Forsikring bought the real estate located between the east of the stadium , Ring 3 and the Sognsvann Line . The lot covered 30 @,@ 000 square metres ( 320 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , including the commercial properties under the stands . A new zoning plan was rejected by the municipality in 2000 , but in 2005 the plans were passed . In 2008 , Vital started constructing a hotel and more commercial spaces at the site . The hotel had 144 rooms and would be operated by Thon Hotel ; other investments included a congress hall for 800 people and a reconstruction of the sports facility Bergbanen . Total area was 24 @,@ 000 square meters ( 260 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , including 1 @,@ 500 square meters ( 16 @,@ 000 sq ft ) for the congress center , 5 @,@ 000 square meters ( 54 @,@ 000 sq ft ) for the four @-@ story hotel , and a 6 @,@ 300 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 68 @,@ 000 sq ft ) expansion of the shopping center by . The shopping center area thus became 53 @,@ 000 square meters ( 570 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . The investments cost NOK 550 million and were scheduled for completion in 2009 . The project also included the bandy field Bergbanen and a new club building for Ullevål IL . Ownership of the bandy venue was transferred to the municipality . 
 On 23 October 2005 , Vålerenga set its attendance record of 24 @,@ 894 in a league match against Rosenborg BK . On 23 March 2007 , NFF bought Lyn 's remaining 13 @.@ 07 % share of Ullevaal , securing the federation full control of the national stadium . Lyn was paid NOK 32 @.@ 5 million for the transaction . Following Lyn 's relegation from the Norwegian Premier League after the 2009 season , the club decided to move its home games from Ullevaal to Bislett . This was to avoid the high costs that the club had renting Ullevaal , which cost the club NOK 150 @,@ 000 per game , compared to a similar fee per season at Bislett . Lyn played its last home game at Ullevaal on 3 November , when it lost 0 – 5 against Fredrikstad FK . In the 2009 season of the Premier League , Vålerenga had the fourth @-@ highest average attendance at 10 @,@ 788 , while Lyn had the lowest at 4 @,@ 187 . Lyn 's least @-@ seen game attracted 2 @,@ 092 people . After it was decided that the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was to be held at Stabæk 's home venue Telenor Arena , Stabæk was forced to rent Ullevaal to play three of its home games during April and May 2010 . In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players ' Association among away @-@ team captains , Ullevaal was found to be the league 's best stadium , with a score of 4 @,@ 47 on a scale from one to five .

The commercial area in the North and East Stands , plus that located north and east of the stadium , is owned by Vital Forsikring . 
 The stadium has a capacity of 25 @,@ 572 spectators , of which 1 @,@ 470 are VIP seats and 28 are for wheelchair users . There are four stands : to the north the <unk> Stand , to the west the VG Stand , to the south the <unk> Stand and to the west the <unk> Stand . The stadium has 16 entrances with 40 counters , five VIP entrances , one ticket office with twelve booths , 40 toilets , 20 kiosks and three emergency rooms . The stadium building is 202 by 162 meters ( 663 by 531 ft ) long and the height of the roof is 23 meters ( 75 ft ) . The sound system provides 66 @,@ 000 watts , and the flood lighting has 160 lamps that give 1 @,@ 400 lux . Ullevaal Business Class offers 29 boxes and 1 @,@ 418 VIP seats directly accessible from the boxes . In addition , in part in conjunction with the hotel , UBC has a number of conference rooms , of which the largest can hold 800 people . 
 The pitch is 105 by 68 meters ( 115 yd × 74 yd ) , and the area within the stands is 122 by 82 meters ( 133 yd × 90 yd ) , of which grass covers 112 by 78 meters ( 122 yd × 85 yd ) . The grass is a combination of <unk> <unk> , Poa pratensis and Poa annua , with 3 % artificial grass sown inn . The pitch features a sprinkler system and under @-@ soil heating with an effect of 750 kW located 25 to 30 centimeters ( 9 @.@ 8 to 11 @.@ 8 in ) under the surface . The pitch has a plastic cover which can cover the full size and which , powered by a fan , <unk> 4 @.@ 5 meters ( 15 ft ) above the ground . 
 The stadium contains 39 square meters ( 420 sq ft ) of press room , a television studio , 16 commentator boxes and 130 square meters ( 1 @,@ 400 sq ft ) of working space for journalists . There is a photography room , a separate section for photographers on the stand , and a press conference room with place for 96 people . All the press facilities are in the South Stand . There are similar facilities in the North Stand , allowing a television team from the opposing nation to make a double production . They can film and send with advertisements from the other side of the stadium and thus increase advertisement income . 
 Both NFF , the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports and many sports federations have their head offices at Ullevaal . At Ullevaal is the Norwegian Football Museum , which offers tours of the stadium . Just east of the stadium is Bergbanen , a municipal bandy field used by Ullevål IL . The field is located on top of a parking house . NFF owns 40 @,@ 000 square meters ( 430 @,@ 000 sq ft ) and Vital owns 53 @,@ 000 square meters ( 570 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of commercial property at Ullevaal , including a shopping center and office space .

 The stadium is located next to the Ullevål stadion station of the Oslo Metro , and is served by lines 3 , 4 and 5 ( the Sognsvann Line and the Ring Line ) . The stadium is also within a ten @-@ minute walk from Rikshospitalet station of the Oslo Tramway , located on the Ullevål Hageby Line and served by trams 17 and 18 . In addition , the motorway Ring 3 runs nearby . Parking is available at Rikshospitalet , Domus <unk> and Sogn Upper Secondary School ; these are within a five minutes walk .

 In 2005 , NFF launched plans for a redevelopment of Ullevaal , including artificial turf , a retractable roof and redevelopment of the West Stand to increase total capacity to 30 @,@ 500 spectators . The combination of the three would allow Ullevaal to become a multi @-@ purpose venue and allow more matches to be played , grant the teams more practice time on their home pitch , make room for sponsor events , allow more concerts and potentially allow non @-@ football sports , such as sprint skiing , to be held . 
 To make it easier to attract good international teams , the management of Ullevaal considered coordinating the laying of artificial turf with Parken Stadium in Copenhagen and Råsunda <unk> in Stockholm , the home of the Danish and Swedish national teams , respectively . Plans for artificial turf were rejected by both Lyn and Vålerenga , who both threatened to move elsewhere should the stadium install artificial turf . Commentators have stated that among older footballers there is opposition against artificial turf , but that long Norwegian winters cause pitches to be extremely bad during the early parts of the season . It has been argued that younger Norwegian players are used to artificial turf and that in the future they will need better pitches to play " finer " football . In 2010 , seven of sixteen premiership stadiums used artificial turf ; commentators have stated that if Ullevaal converted , it could be a pivoting point for other clubs to do the same . 
 Vålerenga has stated that they want to relocate and have conducted plans to build a new stadium at Valle Hovin , where the club currently have their administration and training facilities . Plans exist for stadiums for 22 @,@ 000 spectators , which would be expandable to 32 @,@ 000 . Part of the rationale for their own stadium is that Vålerenga traditionally is the east side team , while Ullevaal is located in the heart of the west side . As an alternative , Vålerenga has considered moving back to Bislett , at least as a temporary solution . 
 NFF has launched plans for a new national football stadium . Inspired by the new Friends Arena to be built in Stockholm , a new venue would have a capacity for 52 @,@ 000 spectators and was part of the joint Norwegian – Swedish bid for UEFA Euro 2016 . To finance a new stadium , NFF would have to sell Ullevaal . NFF stated that expanding Ullevaal beyond 31 @,@ 000 spectators would be excessively expensive and that the location poses limitations in transport infrastructure to handle so large crowds . In 2008 , Ullevaal , including the 40 @,@ 000 square meters ( 430 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of commercial area owned by NFF , was valued to about NOK 1 billion , of which the commercial area was valuated at NOK 750 million . In 2006 , Ullevaal Stadion AS had NOK 522 million in debt .

 In 1950 , Lester began his coaching career at Walton High School in Walton , West Virginia from 1950 to 1951 . The following season , he moved on to Allegany High School in Cumberland , Maryland . From 1956 to 1958 , Lester served under Tommy Mont as the University of Maryland 's ends coach and freshman team coach for three seasons . Lester served the head football coach at Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville , Maryland from 1959 to 1968 . During his tenure , Richard Montgomery compiled an 86 – 10 – 1 record , which included six undefeated <unk> Montgomery To Honor Lester , The Washington Post , September 20 , 2002 . In a time before Maryland hosted high school football playoffs , Lester 's teams were considered some of the best in the state . 
 At the end of his stint at Richard Montgomery in 1968 , he held a 25 @-@ game winning streak , and his 1968 team was ranked third in the nation . 
 Future NFL linebacker Mike Curtis was among the players under Lester at Richard Montgomery .

 In 1969 , Lester was hired as Maryland 's fourth head coach in five years . His embattled predecessor , Bob Ward , had been forced out in the face of a player rebellion and a combined 2 – 17 record . 
 Lester had previously twice applied for the Maryland head coach position . The Daytona Beach Morning Journal speculated that Lester 's undisclosed salary probably matched that of Ward : $ 20 @,@ 000 . 
 Lester reintroduced the split @-@ T formation at Maryland , which Jim Tatum had used to great effect there in the 1950s . 
 Lester 's philosophy was explained by the Maryland sports information director Jack Zane : " the pass should open up the defense for the running game . " In the sixth game of his first season , Maryland 's starting quarterback , junior Dennis O 'Hara , was injured in a loss at South Carolina , and was replaced by sophomore Jeff <unk> . 
 In the season 's penultimate game , Maryland lost to Penn State , 48 – 0 . Penn State halfback <unk> Mitchell had been recruited by Lester and originally intended to go to Maryland before he opted for Penn State instead . Lester was bothered by a similar situation with fullback Franco Harris , whose high school coach was a friend of Lester 's . Lester attributed Maryland 's football woes to the turnover at head coach and lack of depth because of recruitment shortcomings . Maryland won the finale against Virginia to finish the season with a 3 – 7 record . 
 In 1970 , Lester 's Terrapins finished with a 2 – 9 record . After an upset loss in the season opener against Villanova , 21 – 3 , Lester shuffled the roster . He switched the positions of eight players , which included Tom Miller from fullback to <unk> season prior , Miller had gained 629 yards , the second @-@ most ever by a Maryland sophomore . 
 After losing their first five games , Maryland beat South Carolina on Homecoming weekend , 21 – 15 , which prompted Maryland fans to tear down the goalposts in <unk> the 25 @-@ mile per hour winds , the Terrapins capitalized on the Gamecocks ' poor punting game , which included one blocked punt . 
 Two weeks later , Maryland was beaten by Clemson , which scored 21 points in the fourth quarter to win , 24 – 11 . 
 With the loss , Maryland slid to a 1 – 7 record , and Lester said he was giving serious consideration to stepping down before the next season . He said , " If I 'm not doing the proper job I 'm willing to relinquish the job . I took this loss very personally . " 
 In 1971 , some observers considered Maryland , which returned 37 lettermen , to be the dark horse in the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) . Lester said he expected a winning season and that " a lot of people may be surprised . " 
 However , the Terrapins dropped the season opener to underdog Villanova once again , 28 – <unk> @-@ News called it the most stunning of five upsets in the ACC teams ' opening weekend , rating it ahead of NC State 's loss to Kent State , Virginia 's loss to Navy , South Carolina 's win against Georgia Tech , and Duke 's win against <unk> won the following week against NC State , but then dropped five straight before beating the Virginia Military Institute on Homecoming . Maryland closed the season with losses to Penn State , Clemson , and Virginia to again finish with a 2 – 9 <unk> was fired at the conclusion of the 1971 season . Athletic director Jim Kehoe cited Maryland 's worst record in the ACC for two consecutive years and stated his goal of making Maryland a " nationally ranked caliber " team . 
 Kehoe also said , " financial factors are a serious consideration , " and that home game attendance had fallen to its lowest point , which threatened the financial well @-@ being of the athletic department . Lester was replaced by Jerry Claiborne , who later went on to considerable success in the position . 
 In September 1973 , Maryland All @-@ American guard Paul <unk> , then playing under Claiborne , said of the past coaches ' difficulties : " A lot of the kids said that Ward was a good coach but that he had a lot of bad apples . Lester was a high school coach and nobody had ever heard of him . I can 't understand it . We had nine freshman who were All @-@ Americans my first year here under Lester . Maybe if they had let him stay he could have done the job . 
 One of Lester 's lasting contributions was the recruitment of future Maryland and NFL star Randy White . 
 At the end of his tenure , Lester had a combined collegiate coaching record of 7 – 25 .

 In 1972 , Lester returned to the interscholastic ranks as a head coach at Paint Branch High School in Burtonsville , Maryland , which awarded him a ten @-@ year contract . 
 It was Paint Branch 's third year of varsity football , and their first two campaigns had ended with 3 – 7 records . About the move , Lester said , " I spent too long treating college players nice and making sure they were happy ... I don 't have to do that now . I can coach here . If they want to quit , fine . " In 1975 , he led Paint Branch to the Class B state championship . 
 From 1979 to 1993 , Lester served as head coach at Magruder High School in Rockville , Maryland . 
 In 1984 , Lester led Magruder to capture the Class B state championship , and repeated the feat with the Class A state championship in <unk> 1989 , he earned his 200th win as a high school coach when Magruder defeated Einstein , 24 – 0 , to bring his interscholastic record to 200 – 61 .

 = Ray Lindwall with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948 = 
 Ray Lindwall was a key member of Donald Bradman 's famous Australian cricket team , which toured England in 1948 . The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches ; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles . 
 Lindwall played as a right @-@ arm opening fast bowler and right @-@ handed batsman in the lower middle @-@ order . Along with Keith Miller , Lindwall formed Australia 's first @-@ choice pace duo , regarded as one of the best of all time , and Bradman typically used them in short and sharp bursts against the home batsmen with the new ball . The pair were used to target England 's leading batsmen , Len Hutton and Denis Compton during the major matches , and subdued Hutton for much of the summer . England had agreed to make a new ball available after every 55 overs , more often than the usual regulations at the time , thereby allowing the pair more frequent use of a shiny ball that swung at high pace . Bradman gave the duo lighter workloads in the tour matches in order to preserve their energy for the new ball battles against England ’ s key batsmen in the Tests . Lindwall was a capable lower @-@ order batsman who made two Test centuries during his career , and he featured in several rearguard actions that boosted Australia 's scores during the tour . 
 Lindwall was the equal leading wicket @-@ taker in the Tests ( 27 along with Bill Johnston ) and had the best bowling average ( 19 @.@ 62 ) and strike rate . In the first @-@ class matches , he led the averages although he was second in the wicket @-@ taking list with 86 at 15 @.@ 68 behind Johnston ( 102 ) , who was assigned more of the workload in order to keep Miller and Lindwall fresh for the Tests . With the bat , Lindwall scored 191 runs at a batting average of 31 @.@ 83 in the Tests . 
 Lindwall 's most influential contributions in the Ashes matches were his 5 / 70 in the first innings of the Second Test at Lord 's , a hard @-@ hitting 77 that limited Australia 's first innings deficit in the Fourth Test at Headingley , and most notably , his 6 / 20 on the first day of the Fifth Test at The Oval . The performance was a display of extreme pace and swing that earned high praise from pundits and was largely responsible for England being bowled out for 52 . Outside the Tests , Lindwall took 11 / 59 in a match against Sussex , with eight of his victims being bowled as the ball curved through their defences at high pace . In recognition of his achievements , Lindwall was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year . Wisden said that " by whatever standard he is judged ... [ Lindwall ] must be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers " . 
 = = Background = = 
 A bowler of express pace , Lindwall was a regular member of the Test team and had opened Australia ’ s attack since the resumption of cricket following World War II . During the Australian summer of 1946 – 47 , Lindwall played in all five Tests against the touring Indian cricket team . He played a major part in Australia 's 4 – 0 series win as the leading wicket @-@ taker with 18 scalps at an average of 16 @.@ 88 , ahead of Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston who took 16 apiece at averages of 16 @.@ 31 and 11 @.@ 37 respectively . As a result , Lindwall was selected as part of Don Bradman 's Invincibles that toured England without defeat in 1948 , with the intention of leading the pace attack . There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead @-@ up to the tour . Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon and his foot drag during the delivery stride led to discussion in the media and among umpires as to its legality . 
 Bradman arranged for Lindwall to see his Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders , who restored the paceman ’ s leg to prime condition in a fortnight . On the public relations front , Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall 's delivery . During the lengthy sea voyage to England , Bradman emphasized the importance of caution with respect to his bowling action . Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no @-@ balled , and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride . The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead @-@ in tour matches was passing the umpires ' scrutiny . Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no @-@ balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign , destroying his confidence for the rest of the season . 
 = = Early tour = = 
 In the lead @-@ up to the match against Worcestershire , photographers and cameramen constantly followed Lindwall , trying to capture visual evidence of an illegal drag when he was bowling in the practice nets . Bradman tried to stop the journalists from taking photographs of the crease as Lindwall came in to bowl , and deflected media questions about his bowler 's drag . The spectators and media were keenly observing the position of his foot in the tour opener , but Lindwall was not no @-@ balled in the first match at Worcester , and complaints about his drag faded away for the rest of the tour . The hosts elected to bat first , and Lindwall took 2 / 41 in the first innings , bowling and trapping his victims leg before wicket before delivering three wicketless overs for 19 runs in the second innings . Lindwall took a wicket with his second ball in England , trapping Don Kenyon for a duck to leave the hosts at 1 / 0 . He was promoted to No. 4 as Bradman rotated his batting order and he scored a quickfire 32 from 34 balls with six boundaries before Australia completed an innings victory . According to former Australian Test batsman and journalist Jack Fingleton , Lindwall " took things very quietly ... The fast bowler is very wise who builds up his speed match by match " . With the media and public attention now focused on actual bowling , Lindwall 's classical bowling action evoked almost as much interest as his captain 's batting . 
 Bradman rested Lindwall for the second tour match against Leicestershire , which ended in an innings victory for the Australians . Lindwall returned for the next fixture against Yorkshire at Bradford , but bowled only nine overs for a total of 1 / 16 . He made a duck in the first innings on a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling , as Australia scraped home by four wickets . Lindwall was due in next when Australia collapsed to 6 / 31 in pursuit of 60 for victory in the second innings . The tourists were effectively seven wickets down with the injured Sam Loxton unable to bat , but Neil Harvey and Don Tallon saw Australia to the target without further loss . It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour . The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval . They batted first and Lindwall managed only four , clean bowled by Alec Bedser , as Australia amassed 632 . He then took the first two wickets to reduce Surrey to 2 / 15 in the first innings . Bradman used Lindwall sparingly , taking a match total of 3 / 45 from 25 overs as Surrey were defeated by an innings . Fingleton felt that Lindwall was at his fastest for the season during the Surrey match . One of Lindwall 's bouncers flew over three feet above the batsman 's head . 
 Lindwall had another light workout in the match against Cambridge University , taking match figures of 1 / 33 from nine overs . His solitary wicket was that of Doug Insole , and he was not required to bat as Australia completed another innings victory . After the fixture against Cambridge , Lindwall was rested for two consecutive matches . In the first , Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs , its largest winning margin for the summer . The second match resulted in another innings victory , this time over Oxford University . 
 Lindwall was brought back for the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) at Lord 's . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and were basically a full strength Test team , while Australia selected their first @-@ choice team . It was a chance for the Australian pace attack to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests , with Len Hutton , Denis Compton and Bill Edrich — three of England 's first four batsmen — all playing . Australia batted first and Lindwall scored 29 , including three sixes from the bowling of England Test off spinner Jim Laker . After Australia amassed 552 , Lindwall took combined figures of 2 / 68 , removing Compton and England and MCC captain Norman Yardley as the tourists enforced the follow on by an innings and 158 runs . The MCC fixture was followed by Australia 'a first non @-@ victory of the tour against Lancashire . After the first day was washed out , Lindwall made a duck and then took 3 / 44 , removing Test players Ken Cranston and Jack Ikin during the hosts ’ only innings . He was not required to bat in the second innings as the match petered into a draw on the final day . 
 In the next match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge , Lindwall took 6 / 14 to gain a psychological blow ahead of the First Test to be held at the same venue . After taking the first four wickets and cutting through the top @-@ order , the paceman returned to finish off the tail and ensure the hosts were dismissed for 179 . Lindwall bowled three of his victims with fast and swinging yorkers . He delivered 91 balls , conceding less than a run per over . Only ten of his balls were scored from and not a single run was taken from his last 30 balls . Fingleton said that Lindwall " absolutely paralysed " the batsmen , with some of his bowling " in the real Larwood manner " . Harold Larwood was a Nottinghamshire express pace bowler of the 1920s and 1930s who led the controversial Bodyline attack in Australia in 1932 – 33 , and Lindwall modelled his bowling action on Larwood after seeing him in action at the Sydney Cricket Ground during the tour . Lindwall could only manage eight runs with the bat and was unable to repeat his incisive bowling in the second innings , sending down 14 wicketless overs as the match ended in a draw . 
 Lindwall was rested for Australia ’ s eight @-@ wicket win over Hampshire , before returning in the following match against Sussex . Bowling with a tailwind , he took two early wickets before returning to remove the last four batsmen to fall . Five of Lindwall 's opponents were bowled as he ended with 6 / 34 from 19 @.@ 4 overs ; the hosts were dismissed for 86 . During the tourists ' reply , Bradman promoted Lindwall to No. 4 and he came to the wicket at 2 / 342 , scored 57 and put on 93 runs with Neil Harvey , who scored an unbeaten 100 as Australia declared at 5 / 549 . Lindwall then broke through with two early wickets to leave Sussex at 2 / 2 , and went on to finish with 5 / 25 in 15 overs as the home side were bowled out for 138 , handing Bradman ’ s men a victory by an innings and 325 runs in two days . He ended with match figures of 11 / 59 , with eight of his victims being bowled , five of these by swinging yorkers , unable to counter Lindwall ’ s swerving deliveries . Fingleton said that " Lindwall bundled the stumps over in all directions " as Sussex " crumpled completely ... in as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew " . 
 = = First Test = = 
 Lindwall lined up for the First Test at Trent Bridge , a venue where he had taken six wickets in the tour game against Nottinghamshire . Australia bowled first , and Lindwall delivered the first ball of the match at a moderate pace ; Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings . Lindwall gradually increased his speed and rhythm , and took the wicket of Cyril Washbrook , caught on the run by Bill Brown on the fine leg boundary after the batsman had attempted a hook shot . However , he was forced to leave the field with a groin strain midway through the first day , ending with figures of 1 / 30 . After England were out for 165 , Lindwall came out to bat at 7 / 365 without a runner on the third day , and appeared to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty . He added 107 runs for the eighth wicket with vice @-@ captain Lindsay Hassett . Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting before Bedser struck his off stump . Four runs later , Lindwall was caught by wicket @-@ keeper Godfrey Evans down the leg side to leave the total at 6 / 469 , but some free hitting by Australia ’ s last pair allowed them to advance to 509 , giving them a 344 @-@ run lead . 
 Although Lindwall was able to jog between the wickets , he did not take the field in the second innings and the 12th man Neil Harvey replaced him . This gave Australia a marked fielding advantage — Fingleton described Harvey as " by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides " . Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field , but he did not formally object to Harvey ’ s presence on the field . Journalist , former Australian Test cricketer and Lindwall mentor Bill O 'Reilly , said that as Lindwall demonstrated his mobility during his innings , he was in no way " incapacitated " and that the English captain " must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far " when no substitute was justified . O 'Reilly decried the benefit Australia derived through the substitution , agreeing with Fingleton that Harvey was the tourists ' best fielder by far . English commentator John Arlott went further , calling Harvey the best fielder in the world . 
 However , the gains provided by Harvey were outweighed by Lindwall 's absence , which severely hampered Australia 's bowling and made their eventual victory much more difficult . England made 441 and Australia reached their target of 98 on the final afternoon to complete an eight @-@ wicket victory . Due to his injury , Lindwall was omitted from the team for the two matches leading up to the Second Test . Australia proceeded to defeat Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing with Yorkshire . 
 = = Second Test = = 
 Two weeks after injuring himself at Trent Bridge , Lindwall undertook a thorough fitness examination on the morning of the Second Test at Lord 's . Bradman was not convinced of the bowler 's fitness , but Lindwall — keen to play at the historic ground known as the " home of cricket " — was able to convince his captain to risk his inclusion . Australia won the toss and elected to bat , allowing Lindwall further time to recover . He came in late on the first afternoon with the score at 7 / 246 and made three runs before stumps were called at 7 / 258 . The next morning , Lindwall batted confidently from the outset . He hit two cover drives for four from Bedser after the new ball had been taken , prompting O 'Reilly to say that Lindwall was playing in the same manner as when he made his maiden Test century in the last Ashes series in 1946 – 47 . However , he then played around a straight ball from Bedser , and was bowled for 15 to leave the score at 275 / 8 . Australia were out for 350 shortly before lunch on the second morning . In the hosts ' reply , Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after delivering the first ball of the innings to Len Hutton . Despite this , the paceman persevered through the pain . 
 In his fourth over , Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight after needlessly playing at a ball wide outside off stump . Before lunch , Lindwall bowled six overs and took 1 / 7 , while Bill Johnston accompanied him from the other end because Keith Miller had a back injury and was only able to bat . Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling , and the new batsman Bill Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side , leading to a loud appeal for caught behind , which was turned down . After the lunch break , Hutton fell , and Compton came in , having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in the First Test while trying to avoid a bouncer . Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away , but the new batsman was not caught off @-@ guard . Lindwall then clean bowled Bill Edrich — who was playing across the line of the ball — for five . Tom Dollery was the new batsman and stopped the first ball with his pads before Lindwall ’ s next delivery broke through his defences and hit the stumps to send him back to the pavilion for a duck . Dollery 's bat was about to start its downward swing by the time Lindwall 's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps . O 'Reilly said that Dollery 's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket 's lack of answers to express pace bowling . This was part of a six @-@ over post @-@ lunch spell of 2 / 11 by Lindwall ; the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his swing and extreme pace . England were 4 / 46 and Australia firmly in control , but the home side were given some respite when both Lindwall and Johnston were taken out of the attack . Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break , but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels . 
 Once the second new ball was taken after tea , Lindwall returned but appeared to be tired and lacking in spirit in his first over . Johnston removed Compton , and one run later , Lindwall clipped Yardley 's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134 / 6 ; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot . At the start of the third morning , he bowled Alec Bedser off an inside edge from a bouncer to finish with 5 / 70 as Australia took a 135 @-@ run first innings lead on the third morning . O 'Reilly said Lindwall " bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl . He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task ... and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler . " Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace , line and length , and how he kept the batsman guessing as to what was coming to them . 
 Bradman ’ s batsmen set about building on their lead and Lindwall was initially not expected to bat ; the Australian captain was expected to declare just before lunch on the fourth day so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment , but a shower deterred him from doing so , as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball . Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times . Lindwall came to the crease to join Miller with Australia at 5 / 416 on the fourth afternoon . They attacked at every opportunity before the declaration . Miller fell and Lindwall ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary . He missed and was stumped for 25 . This prompted Bradman to declare at 7 / 460 immediately upon his dismissal , leaving England to chase a world record 596 for victory . 
 Further showers breathed extra life into the pitch at the start of the run chase , and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball , troubling the English batsmen . Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston 's bowling before he had scored and the English batsmen played and missed multiple times . Hutton had trouble seeing and playing Lindwall ’ s deliveries in the deteriorating light with no sightscreen available , and Fingleton described it as " probably Hutton 's worst effort in a Test " . O 'Reilly said Hutton " seemed to have lost all power of concentration and looked like a man being led to the gallows " , calling him " little more than a masquerader compared to the Hutton [ of 1938 ] " . Hutton took 32 minutes of batting to score his first run of the innings . 
 Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42 — England 's highest opening partnership of the series thus far — before the latter edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips and was out for 13 . Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls , and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall 's bouncers , having decided to avoid the hook shot . However , they survived Lindwall 's spell of bowling . Late in the day , Lindwall was brought back to put pressure on Dollery , having bowled him for a duck in the first innings , but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period , and played the pace bowling with more assurance . 
 Lindwall returned on the final morning with the score at 6 / 141 . Dollery , who had been batting with assurance , shaped to duck under a Lindwall bouncer , but it skidded through low and bowled him . Later in the same over , Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck to leave England at 8 / 141 . The match ended when Doug Wright hit Ernie Toshack to Lindwall and was caught for four . Lindwall ended with 3 / 61 as Australia took a 409 @-@ run victory . Arlott said that while Toshack ( 5 / 40 ) had the best figures , Lindwall was the pivotal figure . He said that when Lindwall " so patently disturbed Hutton he struck a blow at the morale of the English batting that was never overcome . " In later years , Bradman told Lindwall he pretended not to notice the bowler 's pain . Lindwall was worried Bradman had noticed his injury and would be disappointed , but the Australian captain later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax and focus on his bowling . 
 After carrying an injury into the Second Test , Bradman rested Lindwall for the match against Surrey , which started the day after the proceedings at Lord ’ s ended ; Australia took a ten @-@ wicket victory . Lindwall returned for the match against Gloucestershire . Australia batted first and made 7 / 774 , its highest score of the tour and the second highest by any Australian team in England . Lindwall was not able to partake in the prolific run @-@ getting , as the tourists declared before he had scored . He bowled a total of 21 overs , taking 0 / 41 as Australia enforced the follow on and won by an innings and 363 runs . 
 = = Third Test = = 
 When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test , Hutton had been dropped , sparking much acrimony and controversy in the English cricket community . The reason was said to be Hutton 's difficulties against Lindwall 's short @-@ pitched bowling . Observers noticed Hutton backing away , and the English selectors believed such a sight would have a negative effect on the rest of the side as it was a poor example from a key player . The Australians were pleased and believed the England selectors had erred , because they regarded Hutton as the hosts ' best batsman . England batted first and Lindwall removed Hutton ’ s replacement as opener , George Emmett , who fended a short ball to Sid Barnes at short leg to leave England at 2 / 28 . Emmett had been surprised by Lindwall 's bouncer and took his eyes from the ball , fending with one hand on the bat , while ducking his head below his arms . The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett ’ s bat , rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect . In Australia ’ s match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test , Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett , who hesitantly parried it away for a single . Lindwall did not bounce Emmett again during the match , and O ’ Reilly surmised that the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent ’ s weakness against the short ball . O ’ Reilly concluded that Lindwall and Johnston " had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort " . 
 Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with a short ball , provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood . During this period , both Edrich and Compton found it difficult to position themselves quickly enough to play Lindwall . The Australian paceman then hit Compton on the arm , and soon after , felled him with a bouncer that the batsman top @-@ edged into his face . This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2 / 33 . Upon hearing the umpire ’ s call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him , and knowing he was immune from dismissal , Compton decided to change his stroke . Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side , he then attempted to hook the ball , but could not readjust quickly enough . The velocity of the ball was such that after rebounding from his head , it flew more than half @-@ way to the boundary before landing . This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup . 
 Lindwall returned to take the second new ball and trapped Jack Crapp , who did not offer a shot , for 37 to leave the score at 3 / 87 . The batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump . Lindwall later had Edrich <unk> a rearing ball to the wicket @-@ keeper to leave England at 5 / 119 . Compton returned upon the fall of the fifth wicket to revive the innings and Lindwall ended with 4 / 99 after having Godfrey Evans caught behind from an expansive cut shot . England ended on 363 all out on the second day ; Compton made an unbeaten 145 . Lindwall had beaten Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch on the second day , but the Englishman survived to add more than 20 further runs . On the third day , Lindwall came to the crease at 6 / 172 after Barnes — who had collapsed due to the aftereffects of being hit in the ribs from point blank range when fielding — had been forced to retire hurt . Australia faced the prospect of being forced to follow on , and Lindwall received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich , one of which hit him in the hand , evoking cheers from the home crowd . Lindwall made 23 as Australia struggled to 221 and avoided the follow on by eight runs ; he was the last man to be dismissed . 
 At the start of England 's second innings , Washbrook took a single from Lindwall , who promptly removed Emmett for a duck . Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket @-@ keeper Tallon , who dived and took it in his right hand . This brought Lindwall ’ s tormentor Edrich to the crease . Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich , fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention . However , Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers , angering the crowd . He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop ; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling . Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line . After a disagreement , Davies threw Lindwall his jumper , but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman . Lindwall bounced Washbrook again and this time the England opener went for the hook shot . The ball flew off the top edge in the air , straight towards Hassett at fine leg , who dropped the catch after juggling three times . Having received a reprieve on 21 , Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1 / 80 . 
 Lindwall returned for a new spell late on the third day and almost hit Washbrook in the head . Hassett again dropped Washbrook , who was on 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg . The Australian vice @-@ captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman to signify his need for protection from the ball , much to the amusement of the crowd . Lindwall ended with 1 / 37 as England declared at their stumps score of 3 / 174 after the entire fourth day and the final morning was washed out . The match petered into a draw with Lindwall not required as Australia safely batted out the final day . Lindwall played in Australia 's only match — against Middlesex — before the Fourth Test , but was not at his best . He and Miller had been partying heavily in the days before the match , and were out and binge drinking on the night before the match ; they did not return until after dawn , when they were caught severely inebriated by Bradman at breakfast time . Miller was rested for the match , but Lindwall was selected for the match . The home team won the toss and elected to bat , so Lindwall could not rest and sober up in the dressing room while the specialist batsmen were at work . He was asked to bowl a lengthy spell in warm and sunny conditions on the opening morning , and was at times lying on the ground in an attempt to recover during stoppages . Nevertheless , he ended with 1 / 28 from 16 overs , the opposition still unable to score heavily despite his obvious lethargy . He took a total of 3 / 59 from 25 overs and scored one as the tourists won by an innings , removing the home team 's captain George Mann twice and Edrich once . In the second innings , Lindwall took 2 / 31 , but effectively had a third wicket . He bowled a bouncer at opener Jack Robertson , who tried to hook , but missed , suffered a fractured jaw and was forced to retire hurt , prompting angry shouting and booing from sections of the crowd . Robertson defended Lindwall , contending that the delivery was fair and that he had executed his shot incorrectly . 
 = = Fourth Test = = 
 Hutton returned for the Fourth Test at Headingley and played effectively . At one stage he and Washbrook took five boundaries from six Lindwall overs . An opening partnership of 168 resulted until Lindwall bowled him for 81 . The English opener went onto the front foot and was clean bowled , much to the dismay of the home crowd . The stand came after Washbrook had decided to refrain from hooking Lindwall 's bouncers , which had caused him problems in the earlier Tests . England did not lose their second wicket until the last over of the day , when Washbrook hit Johnston into Lindwall ’ s hands for 143 , leaving the total at 2 / 268 . Both Fingleton and O 'Reilly criticised the bowling group as a whole for what they deemed a very lethargic display ; the former deemed it the worst day 's performance since World War II and the latter accused all the Australian bowlers of operating " without object " . 
 During the innings , Lindwall appealed for lbw four times while wicket @-@ keeper Ron Saggers — standing in for the injured Tallon — remained silent , not supporting the appeal . England ran up a large score of 496 but squandered a very strong position after losing their last 8 wickets for 73 runs ; Lindwall had Compton caught down the leg side to give Saggers his first Test catch , leaving England at 6 / 473 . Lindwall ended with 2 / 79 from 38 overs . Fingleton said " this grand fast bowler held the side together splendidly and answered every call " . O ’ Reilly said that until England collapsed — mostly due to unforced errors despite favourable conditions — only Lindwall appeared capable of threatening the batsmen . He said the paceman " kept slogging away , tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after the other members of the attack had lost all signs of hostility ... Bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much more than his share of the galley @-@ slave work . " O ’ Reilly decried Lindwall ’ s workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity . 
 In reply , Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall came in at 6 / 329 on the third afternoon . With the fall of Sam Loxton and Saggers in quick succession , Bradman ’ s men were at 8 / 355 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining . Lindwall hit out , scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling ; he dominated in stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively . He particularly liked to use his feet to get to the ball on the half @-@ volley to hit lofted drives . Of the 103 runs added for the last two wickets , the two tail @-@ enders managed only 25 between them . Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes , before the injured Toshack survived the last 50 minutes until stumps with Johnston running for him . Australia were 9 / 457 at stumps , with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12 . During Lindwall ’ s partnership with Johnston , Yardley bowled himself for over an hour , failing to bring on a frontline bowler in his stead despite being unable to dislodge the batsmen . Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over , but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get the tailenders on strike . Despite Toshack and Johnston ’ s lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively , and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets , Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike and face most of the balls . O ’ Reilly speculated that Yardley may have bowled himself in an attempt to contain the Australians rather than dismiss them before the close of play , so his openers would not have to bat for a short period before stumps when the visitors ' attack could have made inroads . However , Yardley was neither able to contain Lindwall nor dismiss the Australians . Sunday was a rest day , and on Monday , the fourth morning , Lindwall was the last man out in the third over of the day , leaving Australia on 458 , 38 runs in arrears on the first innings . Lindwall edged Bedser into the slips cordon and Crapp took the catch low down in his left hand . 
 England made a strong start in their second innings — the openers registered their second century stand for the match . When Australia took the second new ball , Lindwall — worried by the substantial and hazardous craters in the pitch he and the other bowlers had created while following through on the left @-@ hand side of the crease — changed to bowling from around the wicket and was warned for running on the pitch . He reverted to bowling from over the wicket , although he delivered from the edge of the crease to avoid the holes . O ’ Reilly said the warning to Lindwall played into Australia ’ s hands as the bowler ’ s follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right @-@ hander ’ s off stump that the English bowlers target when Bradman ’ s men had to chase the target . England reached 2 / 232 before Lindwall trapped Edrich to end a 103 @-@ run partnership . The paceman followed this by bowling Jack Crapp , who inside edged an attempted forcing stroke through the off side from the back foot onto his own stumps . This triggered a collapse of 4 / 33 from 3 / 260 to 7 / 293 . Lindwall took 2 / 84 as the hosts declared on the final day at 8 / 365 , leaving Australia to chase a world Test record of 404 for victory , with only 345 minutes available . Centuries to Bradman and Morris in a 301 @-@ run stand saw Australia seal the series 3 – 0 with a record @-@ breaking seven @-@ wicket win with 15 minutes in hand . 
 The paceman was rested for the match against Derbyshire immediately after the Headingley Test , which Australia won by an innings . Lindwall returned for the match against Glamorgan and took 2 / 36 in a rain @-@ affected draw that did not reach the second innings . In the next match against Warwickshire , he claimed 3 / 27 in the first innings , taking three consecutive middle @-@ order wickets — including Test batsmen Tom Dollery and Abdul Hafeez Kardar — in the space of 12 balls as the hosts fell for 138 . In reply , Australia stumbled to 6 / 161 when Lindwall joined Hassett . The pair put on 70 for the seventh wicket , the largest partnership in a low @-@ scoring match . Lindwall ended with 45 , the second highest score for the entire match , as Australia took a 116 @-@ run lead . He took the first wicket and ended with 1 / 32 as Bradman ’ s men won by nine wickets . Australia proceeded to face Lancashire at Old Trafford for the second time during the season in a match that doubled as Washbrook 's benefit . Lindwall made 17 in the tourists ’ first innings of 321 and then dismissed the home side 's first three batsmen , taking 3 / 32 as Lancashire fell for 130 . Washbrook top @-@ scored with 38 before Lindwall had him caught in the slips by Miller . He also collected several painful bruises from Lindwall on his right hand and thumb . Bradman described his leading paceman as being in " stupendous form ... I have not seen before or since such sustained brilliance from a pace bowler " . Australia made 3 / 265 declared in their second innings , leaving the hosts with a target of 457 in less than a day , with Washbrook unable to bat due to Lindwall 's bruising bowling . Lindwall bowled both openers with the new ball , but Lancashire appeared to be safely batting out a draw at 5 / 191 with only eight minutes remaining . Lindwall returned after Bradman took the new ball , and told the slip cordon to move halfway back to the boundary . Bowling with a tailwind , Lindwall was at full pace , in one of the fastest displays Bradman had seen in his long career . He bowled Jack Ikin for 99 and Dick Pollard — who later claimed to have not seen the ball — for a golden duck . The hosts were in danger of suffering a late collapse and defeat , but William Roberts successfully defended the hat @-@ trick ball ; Lancashire lost no further wickets and were 7 / 191 when stumps were drawn ; Lindwall ended with 4 / 27 . He also caused Washbrook to miss the final Test with a thumb injury . The paceman was rested from the non @-@ first @-@ class match against Durham , which was a rain @-@ affected draw . 
 = = Fifth Test = = 
 According to Bradman , Fingleton and O 'Reilly , Lindwall 's performance in the final Test at The Oval was one of the best they had ever seen from any player . English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain @-@ affected pitch , surprising most observers . The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip . Along with the rain , humidity assisted the bowlers , particularly Lindwall , who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights . 
 After Miller had taken an early wicket , Lindwall bounced Compton , resulting in an edge towards the slips cordon . However , the ball continued to rise and cleared the ring of Australian fielders . Hutton called Compton through for a run , but his surprised partner was watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic . Luckily for Compton , the ball went to Hassett at third man , who stopped the ball and waited for the batsman to regather his bat and his composure before returning the ball , thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect a run out . However , this gesture of sportsmanship cost Australia little , because when Compton was on three , Lindwall bowled another bouncer . Compton attempted a hook shot and Arthur Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch , leaving the hosts at 3 / 17 . Fingleton described Morris 's feat as " one of the catches of the season " . 
 After the lunch break , England struggled to 4 / 35 , before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker . The debutant Allan Watkins then batted for 16 balls in an attempt to get off the mark with a series of failed hook shots . He missed an attempted hook shot and was hit in the shoulder by another Lindwall bouncer . Soon after , Watkins was dismissed without scoring after playing across the line and being trapped lbw by Johnston , leaving England at 6 / 42 . Watkins also collected a bruise on his right shoulder for his troubles with Lindwall ; this inhibited his bowling later in the match . Following the departure of Watkins , Lindwall removed Godfrey Evans , Alec Bedser and Young , all yorked in the space of two runs . England fell from 6 / 45 to 9 / 47 , bringing Hollies in at No. 11 to accompany Hutton , who had batted through the innings . Hutton then hit the only boundary of the innings , lofting a straight drive back over Lindwall 's head . The ball almost went for six , landing just short of the fence . The home team ’ s innings ended on 52 when Hutton — who never appeared to be troubled by the bowling — leg glanced Lindwall and was caught by wicket @-@ keeper Don Tallon one @-@ handed , at full stretch to his left . Lindwall described the catch as one of the best he had ever seen . In his post @-@ lunch spell , Lindwall bowled a spell of 8 @.@ 1 overs during which he took 5 / 8 ; he totalled 6 / 20 in 16 @.@ 1 overs . Bradman described the spell as " the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket " . Fingleton , who played against the Bodyline attack in 1932 – 33 , said " I was watching a man almost the equal of Larwood [ the Bodyline spearhead ] in pace ... Truly a great bowler " . O 'Reilly said that Lindwall 's " magnificent performance must go down as one of the greatest bowling efforts in Anglo @-@ Australian Tests . He had two <unk> long sessions in the innings and overcame each so well that he set the seal on his well @-@ earned reputation as one of the best bowlers ever . " 
 In Australia 's reply , Lindwall came in at 6 / 304 and attacked immediately , scoring two fours before falling for nine . He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young , but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air , and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 7 / 332 . The visitors ended on 389 and England started their second innings late on the second day . Debutant John Dewes took strike and got off the mark when he aimed a hook shot and was credited with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder . Lindwall ’ s steepling bouncer had risen over his bat and narrowly missed his head . Lindwall made the early breakthrough soon after , bowling Dewes — who offered no shot — for 10 to leave England at 1 / 20 . Dewes often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball , thereby putting himself into difficulty . 
 Early on the third day , Lindwall bowled Edrich — who was playing across the line — for 28 , hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards to leave England ’ s score at 64 , before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings and took the total to 2 / 121 at lunch . Soon after , with his score on 39 , Compton aimed a hard cut shot that flew into Lindwall 's left hand at second slip for a " freak slip catch " from Johnston 's bowling ; leaving England at 3 / 125 . Lindwall returned for another spell after lunch and bowled Evans for eight . Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall 's yorker in the fading light , and the umpires called off play due to poor visibility after an appeal by Yardley . The next morning , England were bowled out for 188 , giving Australia an innings victory and the series 4 – 0 . Lindwall took 3 / 50 to total 9 / 70 for the match . He ended the Tests as the leading wicket @-@ taker with 27 wickets at 19 @.@ 62 , and scored 191 runs at 31 @.@ 83 . 
 = = Later tour matches = = 
 Seven matches remained on Bradman 's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat . Australia batted first against Kent and Lindwall made only one in a total of 361 . The paceman took two wickets with the new ball to help reduce the hosts to 5 / 16 , before they were all out for 51 ; Lindwall ended with 2 / 16 . Forced to follow on , Kent were reduced to 4 / 37 by three early Lindwall wickets ; the victims included Tony Pawson and former Test wicket @-@ keeper Les Ames . The hosts were further hampered by the absence of opener Leslie Todd , who had been hit on the foot by a Lindwall swinging yorker in the first innings . The blow caused so much bruising that Todd 's foot could not fit inside his cricket boots . Lindwall ended with 4 / 25 as Kent fell for 124 to lose by an innings . In his match total of 6 / 41 from 15 overs , Lindwall bowled four of his victims . The Kent fixture was followed by a match against the Gentlemen of England . Lindwall was not required to bat , and after taking 1 / 39 in the first innings , Bradman allowed him to rest as Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory . Bradman rested Lindwall for the match against Somerset , which resulted in another innings victory for the tourists . The paceman returned against the South of England — a representative team — scoring an unbeaten 17 in an unbroken 61 @-@ run stand with Sam Loxton before Australia declared at 7 / 522 . He then took 1 / 45 as rain ended the match at the conclusion of the hosts ’ second innings . 
 Australia 's biggest challenge in the post @-@ Test tour matches was against the Leveson Gower 's XI . During the last Australian tour in 1938 , this team was effectively a full @-@ strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts . After the hosts had complied , the Australian skipper fielded a full @-@ strength team . In a rain @-@ interrupted match , Lindwall bowled Hutton for a duck with the new ball . He returned and took five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs . His last five victims were former England captain Walter Robins and Test players Freddie Brown , Evans , Bedser and Laker . Lindwall ended with 6 / 59 ; four of his wickets were bowled , while the other two were caught by Ian Johnson in the slips . He made five as Australia with 8 / 489 declared ; time ran out in the rain @-@ affected match with Leveson @-@ Gower 's XI at 0 / 75 . 
 The tour ended with two non @-@ first @-@ class matches against Scotland . Lindwall was rested from the first , which Australia won by an innings . In the second fixture , Lindwall signed off in a low key manner , scoring 15 and taking a total of 0 / 28 from 14 overs as Australia ended their campaign with another innings triumph . 
 = = Role = = 
 When fit , Lindwall opened the bowling with Miller in the Tests , and the pair operated in short and fiery bursts with the new ball . English cricket administrators had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs in the Tests ; at the time , the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored , something which usually took longer than 55 overs . The new regulation played directly into the hands of the Australians , as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack . Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first @-@ choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs . As a result , Lindwall bowled 224 overs , while Australia 's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled 306 . Lindwall led the Test bowling averages , with 27 wickets at 19 @.@ 62 , making him the equal leading wicket @-@ taker along with Johnston , who averaged 23 @.@ 33 . The duo ’ s haul of 27 Test wickets equalled the record for an Australian fast bowler during a tour of England . The Australian pair were substantially ahead the next most successful bowler , England 's Alec Bedser , who took 18 wickets at 38 @.@ 22 . Lindwall 's role as the leading strike bowler is borne out in his economy and strike rate in both the Tests and all first @-@ class matches . He was the least economical of the three pacemen , but took his wickets more frequently than any other frontline bowler . 
 In all first @-@ class matches , he took 86 wickets at 15 @.@ 68 and held onto 14 catches , fielding in the slips . There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no rest day in between , so Bradman ensured Miller and Lindwall remained fresh for the new ball bursts in the Tests by giving them a lighter workload during the tour matches . During all first @-@ class matches , Johnston bowled 851 @.@ 1 overs , Johnson 668 , Lindwall 573 @.@ 4 , Toshack 502 , while Miller bowled only 429 @.@ 4 overs . Outside the Tests , Lindwall bowled 349 @.@ 3 overs , only the fifth heaviest workload among the Australians in those matches . 
 The local batsmen were unable to cope with <unk> high pace and swing ; 43 of his wickets came after his opponent had missed the ball and been bowled . Lindwall scored 411 runs at 24 @.@ 17 with two fifties in the first @-@ class matches , including 191 at 31 @.@ 83 in the Tests . Lindwall had limited batting opportunities , usually playing from No. 7 to No. 9 . It was hard for Lindwall to get any higher up the order as Australia 's other frontline bowlers , such as Colin McCool , Ian Johnson and Doug Ring , all scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first @-@ class career , and were of similar batting ability . As Australia often won by an innings , and declared in the first innings on many occasions due to their batting strength , Lindwall only had 20 innings in his 22 matches , and usually batted at Nos. 7 , 8 and <unk> However , he was often effective when he did get an opportunity . 
 Wisden recognised Lindwall by naming him as one of its five Cricketers of the Year in 1949 . The publication cited the paceman ’ s ability to seize the initiative for Australia in all but one of the Tests by taking early wickets . The fast bowler ’ s success was attributed to a " superb control of length and direction , his change of pace and general skill , the like of which in a slower bowler could be classed as cunning " . The ferocity of Lindwall 's bouncer often prompted opponents to retreat onto the back foot before he had even released the ball . Wisden said that " by whatever standard he is judged ... [ Lindwall ] must be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers " .

 = New York State Route 3 = 
 New York State Route 3 ( NY 3 ) is a major east – west state highway in New York , in the United States , that connects central New York to the North Country region near the Canada – US border via Adirondack Park . The route extends for 246 @.@ 05 miles ( 395 @.@ 98 km ) between its western terminus at an intersection with NY 104A in the Cayuga County town of Sterling and its eastern terminus at a junction with U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) in the Clinton County city of Plattsburgh . NY 3 traverses eight counties and is a lakeside roadway from Mexico to Sackets Harbor , a mountainous route in Adirondack Park , and an urban arterial in Fulton , Watertown , and Plattsburgh . 
 In 1924 , the segment of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway within New York was designated NY 3 . At that time , it spanned the full east – west length of the state , extending from the eastern bank of the Niagara River in North Tonawanda to the western edge of Lake Champlain in Plattsburgh ; however , the routing through the North Country was significantly different at that time from its modern alignment . The route was moved onto its modern routing east of Watertown as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York ; it was truncated to Sterling on its western end and rerouted to follow its current alignment from Sterling to Watertown roughly five years later . 
 Since 1924 , there have been 14 suffixed routes of NY 3 , all designated between NY 3A and NY 3G . Of these , all but one only existed during the 1930s . The only active designation is NY 3A , which was assigned in the 1950s to an alternate route of NY 3 in Jefferson County . 
 = = Route description = = 
 A substantial portion of NY 3 travels east – west across northern New York and passes through the northern part of the Adirondack Mountain Range . Much of this section of the highway is named as part of the Olympic Trail Scenic Byway . 
 The areas NY 3 passes through alternate between long stretches of rural area , consisting of a mix of open terrain and dispersed residences , and compact settlements containing concentrations of houses and businesses . NY 3 is classified mainly as a minor arterial road , the major exception being the section that is concurrent with NY 812 , which is a principal arterial road . Most of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation . Exceptions are in the cities of Watertown and Plattsburgh , where at least part of the road is city @-@ maintained . In Watertown , NY 3 is locally maintained from Massey Street ( southbound US 11 junction ) to the end of the NY 3 / NY 12 overlap . The route is entirely city @-@ maintained in Plattsburgh . 
 = = = Sterling to Watertown = = = 
 NY 3 begins at an intersection with NY 104A in Sterling . NY 3 continues east to meet NY 104 in the center of Hannibal . From there , NY 3 progresses across Oswego County and passes Lake <unk> prior to entering Fulton . Within Fulton , NY 3 intersects NY 48 on the west bank of the Oswego River before crossing the river and meeting NY 481 at the eastern bank . East of the city , NY 3 passes south of the Oswego County Airport as it heads to the northeast through Palermo . Upon intersecting NY 264 , NY 3 becomes signed as a north – south highway instead of as an east – west route . It proceeds north to the village of Mexico , where it meets NY 104 once again . NY 3 and NY 104 overlap briefly through the western portion of the village before separating at the center of Mexico . While NY 104 heads east toward Williamstown , NY 3 heads north toward the hamlet of Texas . 
 East of Texas , NY 3 meets NY 104B near the Lake Ontario shoreline . Past NY 104B , NY 3 parallels both Interstate 81 ( I @-@ 81 ) and US 11 as it heads along the shore of Lake Ontario . Near the Selkirk Shores State Park west of Pulaski , NY 3 intersects NY 13 adjacent to the mouth of the Salmon River . After crossing the Salmon River , NY 3 passes the Sandy Island Beach State Park before entering Jefferson County . At the county line , NY 3 becomes signed as an east – west highway once again . The route continues northward toward Ellisburg where it meets NY 193 at the entrance to Southwick Beach State Park northwest of the community . Past NY 193 , NY 3 passes the lakeside at Westcott Beach State Park prior to entering the vicinity of Sackets Harbor . The route bypasses both Sackets Harbor and the Sackets Harbor Battlefield State Historic Site to the east before separating from Lake Ontario and proceeding eastward toward Watertown . 
 West of the city of Watertown , NY 3 intersects NY 180 southwest of the Watertown International Airport before connecting to I @-@ 81 by way of an interchange at the city line . NY 3 heads east into Watertown , intersecting with both US 11 and NY 12 at Massey Street . At this point , maintenance of NY 3 shifts from the state to the city of Watertown . The route overlaps NY 12 southbound and a short piece of US 11 northbound through downtown to Public Square , where NY 3 meets northbound NY 12 . US 11 northbound leaves NY 3 here while the overlap between NY 3 and NY 12 continues eastward through Watertown . The concurrency ends near the eastern fringe of the city , where NY 3 leaves NY 12 and becomes state @-@ maintained once more as it departs the city to the northeast . 
 = = = Watertown to Plattsburgh = = = 
 In Black River , northeast of Watertown , NY 3 intersects NY 342 at the southwestern tip of the Fort Drum Military Reservation . NY 3 follows the southern edge of the base to Deferiet , where NY 3 turns south to follow the Black River while NY 3A continues along the border of Fort Drum . NY 3 follows the river to Carthage , where it overlaps NY 126 briefly before heading northeast to rejoin NY 3A at Fargo . NY 3 forms the southern boundary of the base from NY 3A east to just west of the Jefferson @-@ Lewis County line ; however , near Natural Bridge , the Fort Drum boundary heads due north before becoming delimited by the Indian River . NY 3 , meanwhile , traverses the river and enters Lewis County . 
 Midway between Natural Bridge and Harrisville , NY 3 intersects NY 812 . NY 812 turns east onto NY 3 , following NY 3 northeast into St. Lawrence County before splitting to the northwest between Harrisville and Pitcairn . Shortly after departing NY 812 , NY 3 enters Adirondack Park . The route follows a largely east – west routing from its entry point to Tupper Lake , where it merges with NY 30 . Near Upper Saranac Lake , NY 30 heads north toward Malone as NY 3 continues northeast through nearby Saranac Lake toward Plattsburgh . 
 West of Plattsburgh , NY 3 exits the park and encounters NY 374 via an interchange . Past the exit , the two routes follow parallel routings before separating outside of Plattsburgh . NY 3 curves to the southeast toward the former Clinton County Airport , where it meets NY 22B just west of what was once the main entrance to the airport . From NY 22B , NY 3 continues east to the outskirts of Plattsburgh , where it meets the Adirondack Northway ( I @-@ 87 ) . Past I @-@ 87 , NY 3 follows Cornelia Street into the city , where it becomes city @-@ maintained . Within Plattsburgh , NY 3 intersects NY 22 before terminating at US 9 just west of Lake Champlain . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Original alignment = = = 
 NY 3 originally followed a vastly different alignment than it does today . In 1924 , it was assigned to the New York portion of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway , an auto trail that extended from Portland , Maine , to Portland , Oregon . In New York , it connected North Tonawanda ( near Niagara Falls ) in the west to Plattsburgh in the east via Rochester and Watertown . NY 3 began at what is now the intersection of US 62 and NY 425 and followed modern NY 425 north through Cambria Station to Cambria Center , from where the highway continued to Lockport on Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , and Upper Mountain Roads and modern NY 31 . It remained on current NY 31 through the city and mostly followed that route 's modern alignment across western New York to the city of Rochester . The most significant exception to this was between Lockport and Gasport , where NY 3 veered south by way of modern NY 77 and County Route 10 ( CR 10 ) to serve the hamlet of McNalls . 
 Within Rochester , NY 3 remained on the current alignment of NY 31 to what is now the intersection of Lyell Avenue and Broad Street . Here , NY 3 broke from modern NY 31 and continued east on Lyell Avenue to State Street . NY 3 then followed State Street , Main Street , and East Avenue ( modern NY 96 ) through downtown before turning north onto Culver Road in the eastern portion of the city . The route remained on Culver Road to Empire Boulevard , where it turned east toward Irondequoit . Once in Irondequoit , it followed what is now NY 404 around the southern extent of Irondequoit Bay to Webster . NY 3 was realigned by 1930 to stay on East Avenue to Winton Road near the eastern edge of the city . Here , the route turned north , following Winton Road through eastern Rochester to Irondequoit , where it rejoined its previous routing at Empire Boulevard . 
 Past Webster , NY 3 followed Ridge Road through Wayne County to Red Creek , where it continued northeast on what is now NY 370 and NY 104A through Red Creek , Fair Haven , and Sterling to western Oswego County . At Southwest Oswego , NY 3 joined the routing of modern NY 104 through Oswego and Mexico to Maple View . Between Maple View and Watertown , NY 3 overlapped NY 2 along what is now US 11 . Past Watertown , NY 3 was routed along today 's NY 12F and NY 180 to Limerick , where it continued north to Clayton by way of modern NY 12E . East of Clayton , it followed modern NY 12 , NY 26 and CR 192 through Alexandria Bay to Redwood . From there , it utilized the current alignment of NY 37 up through Ogdensburg ( by way of Main and Ford Streets in the city ) before continuing to Waddington on Van Rensselaer Road . NY 3 went east from here along a now @-@ dismantled riverside highway and Town Line Road to Massena , where it was routed on modern NY 37B . 
 East of Massena , NY 3 followed a series of local roads that parallel the modern divided highway section of NY 37 to Rooseveltown , at which point it rejoined current NY 37 . The highway remained on today 's NY 37 up to CR 51 northwest of Malone , where NY 3 continued south on CR 51 to modern US 11 ( then NY 2 ) west of the village . After briefly overlapping NY 2 ( current US 11 ) into Malone , NY 3 turned south onto what is now NY 30 , following the route to Paul Smiths . Past Paul Smiths , NY 3 continued east along the length of modern NY 86 to Jay , overlapping then @-@ NY 10 from Harrietstown to Saranac Lake in between . Lastly , from Jay to Plattsburgh , NY 3 overlapped then @-@ NY 6 along what is now NY 9N and US 9 . 
 = = = Early realignments = = = 
 In the late 1920s , NY 3 was rerouted near Malone to follow modern NY 37 into the village , largely eliminating the overlap with US 11 . Additionally , NY 3 was truncated to Jay on its eastern end . The former alignment to Plattsburgh became part of NY 9W from Jay to Keeseville and US 9 from Keeseville to Plattsburgh . A more substantial realignment of NY 3 took place as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 3 now began concurrent with NY 31A at then @-@ NY 18 ( now NY 104 ) in Niagara Falls . The routes proceeded eastward along modern NY 31 to Sanborn , where NY 31A turned north to follow what is now NY 429 back to then @-@ NY 31 . NY 3 continued on current NY 31 for another two miles to Shawnee , where it met its original alignment to North Tonawanda , which became part of NY 425 in the renumbering . At this point , NY 3 rejoined its previous alignment , overlapping NY 425 up to Cambria – Wilson Road , where that route split off and continued to the north . 
 NY 3 was realigned in two locations between Lockport and Rochester . One was just east of Lockport , where it was straightened out to go directly from Lockport to Gasport on modern NY 31 , bypassing McNalls . The other was between Middleport and Medina , where it was realigned to use modern NY 31E instead . NY 3 's old alignment from Lockport to Gasport via McNalls became part of NY 77 west of McNalls and NY 359 north of the community . Its former routing between Middleport and Medina became NY 3A . 
 The most significant realignment that occurred at this time was in the North Country , where NY 3 was shifted onto its current alignment between Watertown and Plattsburgh . From Tupper Lake east to Plattsburgh , most of what became NY 3 was previously part of NY 10 . The NY 10 designation remained in place from Tupper Lake east to Upper Saranac Lake , forming an overlap with NY 3 ; however , it was completely replaced by NY 3 from Saranac Lake east . Between Upper Saranac Lake and Saranac Lake , the routing of NY 3 was previously unnumbered , as was the routing from Watertown to Tupper Lake . 
 = = = Spur routes and US 104 = = = 
 At least four suffixed routes of NY 3 were created as part of the 1930 renumbering . The longest of the four initial routes was NY 3C , an alternate route of NY 3 that generally followed NY 3 's current alignment between Sterling and Watertown . Another was assigned c . 1931 when NY 3 was rerouted between Deferiet and Wilna to bypass Carthage to the north on modern NY 3A . The portion of NY 3 's former routing from Deferiet to Carthage became NY 3F . NY 3 was shifted southward onto modern NY 31 between Shawnee and Lockport c . 1932 . The realignment eliminated overlaps with NY 425 and NY 93 , the latter of which had used NY 3 's former routing east of Cambria – Wilson Road since it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering . Even though all of the former routing had a designation , it was also designated as NY 3A anyway . As a result , the designations of all of NY 3 's spur routes were increased by one letter , meaning the existing NY 3A became NY 3B , NY 3C became NY 3D , and so forth . 
 US 104 was assigned c . 1935 , extending from Niagara Falls to Maple View mostly by way of then @-@ NY 31 west of Rochester and NY 3 from Rochester to Maple View . As a result , NY 31 was shifted southward onto the alignment of NY 3 from Niagara Falls to Rochester while NY 3 was realigned south of Watertown to follow the routing of NY 3D to a new terminus in Sterling . Every spur route of NY 3 was eliminated at this time except for NY 3G . The alignments of NY 3 and NY 3G between Deferiet and Wilna were flipped c . 1938 . 
 = = = Other alignment changes = = = 
 At some point between 1935 and 1938 , NY 3 was truncated further to end at its junction with US 104 in Hannibal . It was moved another half @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) to the east in the early 1960s following the completion of the super two bypass carrying US 104 around the eastern edge of the village . NY 3 continued to end at the super two until the early 1980s . On April 1 , 1980 , ownership and maintenance of NY 3 's former routing between the Cayuga County line and NY 104 was transferred from Oswego County to the state of New York . One year later , on April 1 , 1981 , the state assumed ownership and maintenance of the Cayuga County portion from that county . Both transactions were part of larger highway maintenance swaps between the state and the two counties . NY 3 was reextended westward to NY 104A following the second swap . 
 From Sandy Creek to Henderson , NY 3C ( later NY 3D ) was routed on Weaver Road , CR 121 , NY 193 , CR 78 , NY 178 , and CR 123 . A new lakeside highway between Sandy Creek and the modern junction of NY 3 and NY 193 was opened to traffic c . 1932 as a realignment of NY 3D . An extension of the roadway north to Henderson was completed by the following year . To the southwest in Oswego County , NY 3 was originally routed on modern CR 3 between Hannibal and Fulton and on Hannibal and Oneida Streets through the city of Fulton . The modern arterial through the city was constructed c . 1962 while the Hannibal – Fulton highway was built in the mid @-@ 1960s . 
 = = Suffixed routes = = 
 NY 3 has had 14 suffixed routes over the years ; however , all of them except for one only existed during the 1930s . The only active designation is NY 3A , which is currently assigned to an alternate route of NY 3 in Jefferson County .

 At least four suffixed routes of NY 3 were created as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . Two more were assigned by the following year . All of these were renumbered c . 1932 . 
 NY 3A was an alternate route of NY 3 between Middleport and Medina . It became the western half of NY 3B . 
 NY 3B was a connector between NY 237 in Clarendon and NY 3 south of Brockport . The portion of the route within Monroe County was renumbered to NY 3C . 
 NY 3C was an alternate route of NY 3 between Sterling and Watertown . It was renumbered to NY 3D . 
 NY 3D was a connector between NY 3 in New Haven and NY 3C in the town of Mexico . It was assigned by 1931 and renumbered to NY 3E .

 All the routes below except for the current NY 3A were assigned c . 1932 . 
 NY 3A has been assigned two times since 1932 : 
 The second NY 3A was an alternate route of NY 3 west of Lockport along modern NY 425 and Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , and Upper Mountain Roads ( the latter three then also part of NY 93 ) . The designation was removed c . 1935 , leaving NY 425 and NY 93 as the sole routes on the alignment . 
 The current NY 3A ( 5 @.@ 19 miles or 8 @.@ 35 kilometres ) is an alternate route of NY 3 east of the city of Watertown . While NY 3 dips south between Deferiet and Fargo to serve Carthage , NY 3A is a direct east – west route between the two communities . It was assigned in the early 1950s . 
 NY 3B was an alternate route of NY 3 between Middleport and Knowlesville . It was renumbered to NY 31A c . 1935 . 
 NY 3C was a spur leading from NY 3 south of Brockport to the Orleans County line . It was renumbered to NY 31D c . 1935 . 
 NY 3D was an alternate route of NY 3 between Sterling and Watertown . It became a realignment of NY 3 c . 1935 .

 The episode begins with an announcement that viewers have waited for weeks for the answer to the mystery " Who Is Cartman 's Father " , but then points out that the answer will not be revealed in this episode ; instead , there is a presentation of Not Without My Anus starring Terrance and Phillip . A caption wishes the viewers a happy April Fools ' Day . The drama itself opens in a courtroom in Canada , with Terrance on trial for the murder of a local doctor ; Phillip is his lawyer while Terrance and Phillip 's sworn nemesis , Scott , who has had a long hatred of the duo 's toilet humour , is acting as the prosecutor . Scott uses a group of seemingly airtight exhibits such as a hammer , a piece of Terrance 's shirt , and an incriminating haiku to prove Terrance 's guilt , while Terrance 's defense consists of nothing but a long string of fart jokes . Ultimately , the jury returns a verdict of not guilty . Angered , Scott promises vengeance . He is ultimately approached by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein , proposing a deal : Saddam would assist in getting Terrance and Phillip out of Canada , in exchange for Scott assisting Saddam and his Iraqi associates into Canada . Scott is apprehensive about trusting Saddam , but agrees to the deal .

With brute force everyone farts a huge gas cloud which kills Saddam and his soldiers . Scott arrives , and is annoyed to find not only that Terrance and Phillip are still alive , but " that after all [ his ] criticism , it was farting that saved Canada " .

It was the second season premiere and first episode centered completely around Terrance and Phillip , fictional cartoon characters within the South Park show . The title and general storyline of the episode parody those of the 1987 book and 1991 film Not Without My Daughter , starring Sally Field . 
 The episode , which first aired April 1 , 1998 , was an April Fools ' Day prank by Parker and Stone on South Park fans , who were anxiously waiting to learn the identity of Cartman 's father after the cliffhanger ending of " Cartman 's Mom Is a Dirty Slut " , the first season finale . Instead , Parker and Stone presented an episode entirely focused on a Terrance and Phillip cartoon , with nothing in the story about Cartman 's father . Upset fans wrote more than 2 @,@ 000 angry e @-@ mail complaints to Comedy Central within a week of the episode 's original broadcast , and media outlets said some fans harbored a grudge against the show more than five years after the episode was broadcast . Matt Stone said to Entertainment Weekly in response to the angry fan response , " If you get that pissed off because you don 't know who a little construction paper kid 's father is , then there 's really something wrong with you . " Allan Johnson of the Chicago Tribune said Comedy Central was " <unk> out " with the decision . 
 Several reviewers noted a significant amount of crude and vulgar humor in " Terrance and Philip in Not Without My Anus " , even by South Park standards ; The Sydney Morning Herald noted the episode contained 29 separate fart jokes in the span of 22 minutes . Global Television Network in Canada reported no complaints about the episode in the weeks after its release .

 Reviewers were mixed on Parker and Stone 's elaborate April Fools ' Day prank . Diane Werts of Newsday said of the episode , " Fans rioted . Some jumped ship and never came back . The lesson : Pay off our expectations , or you 'll be sorry . " Jim Minge of the Omaha World @-@ Herald said South Park fans were " duped " by the episode . Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat @-@ Gazette , who said in May 1998 the South Park phenomenon was " dead " , described the April Fools ' prank as " lamentable " and part of the reason for the show 's apparent decline . Others , however , praised Parker and Stone for making the move at the risk of upsetting fans . Tim <unk> of the Winston @-@ Salem Journal said , " It was a funny , clever move ( that ) quickly separated the fans who truly " got " ( Parker and Stone 's ) humor from those who were just watching for the dirty jokes . " Jon Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald said , " It is gratifying , in an entertainment world dominated by market research and common denominators , to see a program that obviously doesn 't care if you like it or not . " However , he said the characterization of Terrance and Phillip was too thin to be particularly funny , and added that the novelty of the prank is lost in repeats in later years . 
 Jakob Von Bayer said the episode continued a long history of South Park Canada @-@ bashing : " South Park has gotten a lot of comic mileage out of Canada over the years . ... This episode portrays a country full of Bob and Doug McKenzies ; Toronto is but a highway town en route to Buffalo . " " Terrance and Philip in Not Without My Anus " was among the episodes featured in a 2006 list by the Winnipeg Free Press of the ten most memorable South Park episodes . The Toronto Sun listed the episode as one of the most memorable television moments of 1998 , and the single most memorable moment from the month of April . The prank played by the airing of this episode was revisited a number of times in subsequent episodes . The episode " Cartoon Wars Part II " revisits it by appearing to begin with a similar spoof , though the episode then cuts to the actual plot . The fifth season episode , " Terrance and Phillip : Behind the Blow " , also references the controversy over the airing of this episode , as does the thirteenth season episode , " Eat , Pray , Queef " .

 In 2008 , the airline was forced to discontinue international routes because these attracted losses due to global economic downturn ; it terminated services to San Francisco and Shanghai . The airline planned to restore the Mumbai – Shanghai route by the end of 2011 but never did so . In 2012 , the airline withdrew flights to New York and closed the Delhi – Milan route in 2013 . On 1 March 2016 , the airline announced the integration of domestic and international operations in Mumbai airport and moved its entire operations to the newly constructed Terminal 2 .

 = Washington State Route 18 = 
 State Route 18 ( SR 18 ) is a 28 @.@ 41 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 45 @.@ 72 km ) state highway in the U.S. state of Washington , serving southeastern King County . The highway travels northeast , primarily as a controlled @-@ access freeway , from an intersection with SR 99 and an interchange with Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) in Federal Way through the cities of Auburn , Kent , Covington , and Maple Valley . SR 18 becomes a two @-@ lane rural highway near Tiger Mountain as it approaches its eastern terminus , an interchange with I @-@ 90 near the cities of Snoqualmie and North Bend . 
 SR 18 was established during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to the Auburn – Federal Way branch of Primary State Highway 5 ( PSH 5 ) and the Auburn – North Bend branch of PSH 2 , which were created in 1931 and 1949 , respectively . The initial two @-@ lane highway , named the Echo Lake Cutoff , was completed in December 1964 after the opening of a section around Tiger Mountain , which would later be the site of over 170 accidents in the 1980s . SR 18 was gradually widened into a four @-@ lane freeway beginning in Auburn in 1992 and most recently finishing in Federal Way in 2007 . The highway around Tiger Mountain and near the I @-@ 90 interchange remains a two @-@ lane road , with a funded project planned to re @-@ build the existing interchange with I @-@ 90 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 18 begins as South 348th Street at a signalized intersection with SR 99 , named the Pacific Highway , in the city of Federal Way . The highway travels due east through an intersection with the Enchanted Parkway , which carries SR 161 southwards towards Wild Waves Theme Park and the city of Puyallup , to a hybrid cloverleaf @-@ stack interchange with I @-@ 5 , providing access to Seattle and Vancouver , British Columbia to the north , and Tacoma and Portland , Oregon to the south . SR 18 becomes a full four @-@ lane freeway as it descends into Peasley Canyon east of a diamond interchange with Weyerhaeuser Way , located south of the Weyerhaeuser headquarters . 
 After exiting the canyon , the freeway enters the city of Auburn and intersects West Valley Highway , signed as SR 181 until 1991 , and SR 167 , named the Valley Freeway , in a complex hybrid partial cloverleaf and diamond interchange . SR 18 continues east past The Outlet Collection Seattle and over the mixed @-@ use Interurban Trail as it approaches a folded cloverleaf interchange with C Street Southwest and a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 164 at Auburn Way . The freeway passes an exit serving Green River Community College via Southeast Auburn @-@ Black Diamond Road before crossing over the Green River into unincorporated King County . 
 SR 18 continues northeast along the southeastern city limits of Kent , through an interchange with Southeast 304th Street , towards Covington . The freeway intersects SR 516 in a diamond interchange and 256th Street Southeast in a partial cloverleaf interchange before leaving Covington . SR 18 intersects Southeast 231st Street in a diamond interchange located north of Maple Valley , providing a connection to SR 169 , while the freeway travels on an overpass over SR 169 towards a partial cloverleaf interchange with 244th Avenue . The SR 18 freeway ends northeast of a partial cloverleaf interchange with Issaquah @-@ Hobart Road at the base of Tiger Mountain , becoming a two @-@ lane highway with at @-@ grade intersections for the remainder of its route . The highway travels on the east side of Tiger Mountain in the Issaquah Alps and provides access to a trailhead in Tiger Mountain State Forest before it reaches its eastern terminus , a diamond interchange with I @-@ 90 located west of North Bend . I @-@ 90 provides access to the cities of Issaquah and Seattle to the west and North Bend and Spokane to the east , traveling over the Cascade Mountains through Snoqualmie Pass . The roadway continues past the interchange as Snoqualmie Parkway into the city of Snoqualmie , intersecting SR 202 . 
 Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2012 , WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 18 was its interchange with SR 167 in Auburn , serving 97 @,@ 000 vehicles , while the least busiest section of the highway was its eastern terminus at I @-@ 90 , serving 19 @,@ 000 vehicles . SR 18 is designated as part of the National Highway System for its whole length , classifying it as important to the national economy , defense , and mobility . WSDOT designates the entire route of SR 18 as a Highway of Statewide Significance , which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington . 
 = = History = = 
 The modern corridor that SR 18 follows was added to the state highway system in 1931 as a branch of State Road 5 that ran from the main highway in Auburn to State Road 1 and U.S. Route 99 ( US 99 ) in Federal Way via Peasley Canyon . The branch was retained by State Road 5 when it was re @-@ designated as PSH 5 as a new highway code was established in 1937 . A branch of PSH 2 was designated in 1949 , traveling southwest from North Bend , around Tiger Mountain and through Auburn before ending at a junction with PSH 1 and US 99 in Milton . 
 Construction on the Echo Lake Cutoff Road , along the route of the North Bend – Auburn branch of PSH 2 and the Auburn – Federal Way branch PSH 5 , began in 1955 . The two @-@ lane highway would cost $ 9 million ( equivalent to $ 80 million in 2016 ) and the 32 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 51 km ) route was chosen to avoid Tiger Mountain and connect the city of Tacoma to Snoqualmie Pass . SR 18 was designated on the corridor during the 1964 state highway renumbering and codified into state law in 1970 , replacing the branches of PSH 2 and PSH 5 . The final 7 miles ( 11 @.@ 27 km ) of the Echo Lake Cutoff , from an entrance to Tiger Mountain State Forest to I @-@ 90 , was officially opened on December 1 , 1964 . A new interchange with I @-@ 5 in Federal Way was opened to traffic on January 31 , 1967 , officially completing SR 18 . 
 Expansion of SR 18 from a two @-@ lane rural road to a four @-@ lane controlled @-@ access freeway began in 1992 response to six fatalities in over 170 accidents in a ten @-@ year period , giving the highway a reputation of being a " dangerous roadway " . WSDOT widened SR 18 to four lanes and added new interchanges between SR 167 and the Green River within Auburn . The Washington State Legislature briefly planned to toll the new SR 18 freeway in January 1995 to pay off loans for re @-@ construction , but the plan was protested by local residents and rejected months later , in May 1995 . Additional work was completed in 1997 from the Green River to Southeast 304th Street in Covington , and in 2007 from Covington through Maple Valley and to Issaquah @-@ Hobart Road . The western end of the freeway was extended in Federal Way through Peasley Canyon to I @-@ 5 in Federal Way , which was further improved in 2011 with the completion of interchange improvements to the " Federal Way Triangle " . 
 WSDOT is planning to widen the remaining section of SR 18 , between Issaquah @-@ Hobart Road south of Tiger Mountain to I @-@ 90 near Snoqualmie to serve capacity to at least 2035 , but funding has not been approved for the project . The project will widen the highway to four general purpose lanes with a truck lane on lanes traveling uphill towards the summit of Tiger Mountain and using concrete median barriers to separate traffic to prevent head @-@ on collisions . A compact diamond interchange is planned for the entrance of Tiger Mountain State Forest and the I @-@ 90 interchange will include flyover ramps from SR 18 to I @-@ 90 and a double roundabout interchange to provide access to Snoqualmie Parkway .

 = Italian cruiser Marco Polo = 
 Marco Polo was an armored cruiser built for the Royal Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) in the 1890s , the first of her type in Italian service . The ship spent the bulk of her career deployed in the Far East . Between deployments she participated in the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 during which she caused a diplomatic incident with the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire . After that affair Marco Polo was sent to Libya where she bombarded the towns of Homs , and Zuara and the defenses of the Dardanelles . In between these operations , the ship provided naval gunfire support to the Royal Italian Army in Libya . Due to her age , Marco Polo did not play a significant role in World War I , serving as an accommodation ship in Venice until she began conversion into a troopship in 1917 . After a series of renamings in 1920 – 21 , the ship was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and subsequently sold for scrap . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Marco Polo was begun as an improved Etna @-@ class protected cruiser , but she was modified while under construction into an armored cruiser , the first such ship in Italian service . The ship had a length between perpendiculars of 99 @.@ 65 meters ( 326 ft 11 in ) and an overall length of 106 @.@ 05 meters ( 347 ft 11 in ) . She had a beam of 14 @.@ 67 meters ( 48 ft 2 in ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 88 meters ( 19 ft 3 in ) . Marco Polo displaced 4 @,@ 583 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 511 long tons ) at normal load , and about 4 @,@ 900 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 800 long tons ) at deep load . The ship had a complement of 22 officers and 372 enlisted men . 
 She was powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller shaft . Steam for the engines was supplied by four Scotch marine boilers and their exhausts were trunked into a pair of funnels amidships . Rated at 10 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) , her engines were designed to give Marco Polo a speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) , but the ship only reached a speed of 17 @.@ 8 knots ( 33 @.@ 0 km / h ; 20 @.@ 5 mph ) during her sea trials even though the engines produced 10 @,@ 663 ihp ( 7 @,@ 951 kW ) . She had a cruising radius of about 5 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 700 km ; 6 @,@ 700 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Marco Polo 's main armament consisted of six 40 @-@ caliber 152 mm ( 6 in ) guns in single mounts . One of these guns was each mounted at the bow and stern and the remaining four at the corners of the central citadel in armored casemates . Ten 40 @-@ caliber 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns served as the ship 's secondary armament . They were all mounted on the broadside , four in unprotected embrasures in the hull sides and the other six on the upper deck protected by gun shields . For defense against torpedo boats , the ship carried nine quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) Hotchkiss guns and two QF 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns . The ship was also equipped with five 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . 
 The ship was protected by a 100 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) armored belt that only protected the middle of her hull . The upper strake of armor was also 100 mm thick and protected just the middle of the ship , up to the height of the upper deck . The armored deck was 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) thick . The armor of the conning tower and the gun shields were both 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Marco Polo , named after the eponymous explorer , was laid down on 1 July 1890 at the Royal Shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia . The ship was launched on 27 October 1892 and completed on 21 July 1894 . She visited Heraklion , Crete and Piraeus , Greece in May 1897 before departing for the Far East on 26 January 1898 . In May , Marco Polo sailed up the Yangtze River to make port visits at Nanking and Hankow before returning to Shanghai in July . She visited Japan from August to November and then sailed to Shanghai where she remained until August 1899 . The ship departed Shanghai on 27 August and arrived in Naples on 20 October 1899 . Marco Polo departed for China in October 1901 and remained there until February 1903 . A year later , she began her third tour there in March 1904 and did not leave China until 14 January 1907 . En route home the ship visited Zanzibar , Mogadishu , Italian Somaliland , and Massawa , Eritrea before arriving at Taranto on 26 April . Marco Polo was rearmed in 1911 and her armament was reduced to six 152 mm , four 120 mm , six 57 mm , and two 37 mm guns . One torpedo tube was also removed during this refit . 
 When the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 began on 29 September 1911 , Marco Polo was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet . She was quickly transferred , however , to the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Prince Luigi Amedeo , Duke of the Abruzzi , Inspector of Torpedo Boats . His command was deployed in the Adriatic Sea and was patrolling the area for Ottoman ships . Marco Polo and two destroyers stopped an Austro @-@ Hungarian ship on 5 October in the bay at San Giovanni di Medua , Albania , and when they sent a boat to board the merchant ship , Ottoman coastal artillery began firing at the boat . The Italian ships returned fire for 45 minutes and silenced the guns after nearly exhausting their ammunition . The incident prompted a diplomatic protest by Austria @-@ Hungary and Italy ceased its operations against the Ottomans in Albania . Marco Polo was then transferred to the 4th Division of the 2nd Squadron , operating off the Libyan coast . 
 On 17 October , she arrived at Homs to support Italian forces attempting to occupy the town and bombarded it after the Ottoman commander refused to surrender . Bad weather prevented any landings until 21 October and the ship continued to provide fire support for the Italian troops . Marco Polo was tasked to provide fire support for the Royal Italian Army and remained at Homs after the bulk of the fleet returned to Italy to refit in December . In early April 1912 , the ship , together with the armored cruiser Carlo Alberto bombarded Zuara as a distraction while the army made an unopposed landing 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) away . About a week later , she rejoined the 4th Division as it , and the bulk of the Italian fleet , sailed east in a futile search for the Ottoman fleet in the Aegean Sea . Marco Polo joined the rest of the fleet in desultorily bombarding the defenses of the entrance to the Dardanelles on 18 April . The ship then returned to Libya where she resumed her previous task of providing fire support for the army . In June she supported the operation to capture Misrata and finally returned home on 16 July . 
 Marco Polo departed Taranto on 25 February 1913 for her fourth deployment to the Far East . When World War I began in August 1914 , she was in Kobe , Japan and the Italian declaration of neutrality on 2 August simplified the problems faced by the Allies in the Far East . The ship departed Shanghai on 7 December and was diverted to <unk> , Yemen , en route and finally reached Naples on 4 March 1915 . Thoroughly obsolete by the time Italy declared war on the Central Powers in May 1915 , Marco Polo was used as an accommodation ship at Venice , among who were the crews of the British submarines operating there from October 1915 through May 1917 . The ship began conversion into a troop transport at the Venetian Arsenal in 1917 . This required the removal of her armor , the replacement of her armament with some 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns and internal modifications to suit her new role . She was recommissioned with the new name of <unk> on 4 April 1918 . The ship was rechristened Europa on 1 October 1920 , discarded on 16 January 1921 , but simultaneously rechristened Volta , then discarded on 5 January 1922 . She was sold for scrap . 
 = Falaise Pocket = 
 The Falaise Pocket or Battle of the Falaise Pocket ( 12 – 21 August 1944 ) was the decisive engagement of the Battle of Normandy in the Second World War . A pocket was formed around Falaise , Calvados , in which the German Army Group B , with the 7th Army and the Fifth Panzer Army ( formerly Panzergruppe West ) were encircled by the Western Allies . The battle is also referred to as the Battle of the Falaise Gap , after the corridor which the Germans sought to maintain to allow their escape and is sometimes referred to as the Chambois Pocket , the Falaise @-@ Chambois Pocket , the Argentan – Falaise Pocket or the Trun – Chambois Gap . The battle resulted in the destruction of most of Army Group B west of the Seine river , which opened the way to Paris and the German border for the Allied armies . 
 Following Operation Cobra , the American breakout from the Normandy beachhead , rapid advances were made to the south and south @-@ east by the Third U.S. Army under the command of General George Patton . Despite lacking the resources to defeat the U.S. breakthrough and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives south of Caumont and Caen , Field Marshal Günther von Kluge , the commander of Army Group B , was not permitted by Adolf Hitler to withdraw but was ordered to conduct a counter @-@ offensive at Mortain against the U.S. breakthrough . Four depleted panzer divisions were not enough to defeat the First U.S. Army . Operation Lüttich was a disaster , which drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment . 
 On 8 August , the Allied ground forces commander , General Bernard Montgomery , ordered the Allied armies to converge on the Falaise – Chambois area to envelop Army Group B , the First U.S. Army forming the southern arm , the British Second Army the base and the First Canadian Army the northern arm of the encirclement . The Germans began to withdraw on 17 August and on 19 August , the Allies linked up in Chambois . Gaps were forced in the Allied lines by German counter @-@ attacks , the biggest being a corridor forced past the 1st Polish Armoured Division on Hill 262 , a commanding position at the mouth of the pocket . By the evening of 21 August , the pocket had been sealed , with c . 50 @,@ 000 Germans trapped inside . Many Germans escaped but losses in men and equipment were huge . Two days later the Allied Liberation of Paris was completed and on 30 August , the remnants of Army Group B retreated across the Seine , which ended Operation Overlord . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Operation Overlord = = = 
 Early Allied objectives in the wake of the D @-@ Day invasion of German @-@ occupied France , included the deep water port of Cherbourg and the area surrounding the town of Caen . Allied attacks to expand the bridgehead had rapidly defeated the initial German attempts to destroy the invasion force but bad weather in the English Channel delayed the Allied build @-@ up of supplies and reinforcements , while enabling the Germans to move troops and supplies with less interference from the Allied air forces . Cherbourg was not captured by the VII U.S. Corps until 27 June and the German defence of Caen lasted until 20 July , when the southern districts were taken by the British and Canadians in Operation Goodwood and Operation Atlantic . 
 General Bernard Montgomery , the Allied ground forces commander , had planned a strategy of attracting German forces to the east end of the bridgehead against the British and Canadian Second Army , while the First U.S. Army advanced down the west side of the Cotentin Peninsula to Avranches . On 25 July the First U.S. Army commander , Lieutenant @-@ General Omar Bradley began Operation Cobra . The First U.S. Army broke through the German defences near St. Lô and by the end of the third day had advanced 15 mi ( 24 km ) south of its start line at several points . On 30 July , Avranches was captured and within 24 hours the VIII U.S. Corps of the Third U.S. Army crossed the bridge at Pontaubault into Brittany and continued south and west through open country , almost without opposition . 
 = = = Operation Lüttich = = = 
 The U.S. advance was swift and by 8 August , Le Mans , the former headquarters of the German 7th Army , had been captured . After Operation Cobra , Operation Bluecoat and Operation Spring , the German army in Normandy was so reduced that " only a few SS fanatics still entertained hopes of avoiding defeat " . On the Eastern Front , Operation Bagration had begun against Army Group Centre which left no possibility of reinforcement of the Western Front . Adolf Hitler sent a directive to Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge , the replacement commander of Army Group B after the sacking of Rundstedt , ordering " an immediate counter @-@ attack between Mortain and Avranches " to " annihilate " the enemy and make contact with the west coast of the Cotentin peninsula . 
 Eight of the nine Panzer divisions in Normandy were to be used in the attack but only four could be made ready in time . The German commanders protested that their forces were incapable of an offensive but the warnings were ignored and Operation Lüttich , commenced on 7 August around Mortain . The first attacks were made by the 2nd Panzer Division , 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler and the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich but they had only 75 Panzer IVs , 70 Panthers and 32 self @-@ propelled guns . The Allies were forewarned by Ultra signals intercepts and although the offensive continued until 13 August the threat of Operation Lüttich had been ended within 24 hours . Operation Lüttich had led to the most powerful remaining German units being defeated at the west end of the Cotentin Peninsula by the First U.S. Army and the Normandy front on the verge of collapse . Bradley said 
 This is an opportunity that comes to a commander not more than once in a century . We 're about to destroy an entire hostile army and go all the way from here to the German border . 
 = = = Operation Totalize = = = 
 The First Canadian Army was ordered to capture high ground north of Falaise to trap Army Group B. The Canadians planned Operation Totalize , with attacks by strategic bombers and a novel night attack using Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers . Operation Totalize began on the night of 7 / 8 August ; the leading infantry rode on the Kangaroos , guided by electronic aids and <unk> , against the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend , which held a 14 km ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) front , supported by the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion and remnants of the 89th Infantry Division . Verrières Ridge and Cintheaux were captured on 9 August but the speed of the advance was slowed by German resistance and some poor Canadian unit leadership , which led to many casualties in the 4th Canadian Armoured Division and 1st Polish Armoured Division . By 10 August , Anglo @-@ Canadian forces had reached Hill 195 , north of Falaise . The following day , Simonds relieved the armoured divisions with infantry divisions , ending the offensive .

 Still expecting von Kluge to withdraw his forces from the tightening Allied noose , Montgomery had for some time been planning a " long envelopment " , by which the British and Canadians would pivot left from Falaise toward the River Seine while the U.S. Third Army blocked the escape route between the Seine and Loire rivers , trapping all surviving German forces in western France . In a telephone conversation on 8 August , the Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower , recommended an American proposal for a shorter envelopment at Argentan . Montgomery and Patton had misgivings ; if the Allies did not take Argentan , Alençon and Falaise quickly , many Germans might escape . Believing he could always fall back on the original plan if necessary , Montgomery accepted the wishes of Bradley as the man on the spot , and the proposal was adopted .

 The Third Army advance from the south made good progress on 12 August ; Alençon was captured and von Kluge was forced to commit troops he had been gathering for a counter @-@ attack . Next day , the 5th U.S. Armored Division of XV U.S. Corps , advanced 35 mi ( 56 km ) and reached positions overlooking Argentan . On 13 August , Bradley over @-@ ruled orders by Patton , for a further push northwards towards Falaise , by the 5th U.S. Armored Division . Bradley ordered the XV U.S. Corps to " concentrate for operations in another direction " . The U.S. troops near Argentan were ordered to withdraw , which ended the pincer movement by XV U.S. Corps . Patton objected but complied , which left an exit for the German forces in the Falaise Pocket . 
 With the Americans on the southern flank halted and then engaged with Panzer Group Eberbach and with the British pressing in from the north @-@ west , the First Canadian Army , which included the Polish 1st Armoured Division , was ordered to close the trap . After a limited attack by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division down the Laize valley on 12 – 13 August , most of the time since Totalize had been spent preparing for Operation Tractable a set @-@ piece attack on Falaise . The operation commenced on 14 August at 11 : 42 , covered by an artillery smokescreen that mimicked the night attack of Operation Totalize . The 4th Canadian Armoured Division and the 1st Polish Armoured Division crossed the Laison but delays at the Dives River gave time for the Tiger tanks of the schwere SS @-@ Panzer Abteilung 102 to counter @-@ attack . 
 Navigating through the smoke slowed progress and the mistaken use by the First Canadian Army of yellow smoke to identify their positions , when the strategic bombers used yellow to mark targets , led to some bombing of the Canadians and slower progress than planned . On 15 August , the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division , 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the 2nd Canadian ( Armoured ) Brigade continued the offensive but progress remained slow . The 4th Armoured Division captured <unk> against determined German resistance and several German counter @-@ attacks , which prevented a breakthrough to Trun . Next day , the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division entered Falaise , against minor opposition from Waffen SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry and by 17 August , had secured the town . 
 At midday on the 16 August , von Kluge had refused an order from Hitler for another counter @-@ attack and in the afternoon Hitler agreed to a withdrawal but became suspicious that von Kluge intended to surrender to the Allies . Late on 17 August , Hitler sacked von Kluge and recalled him to Germany ; von Kluge then either committed suicide or was killed by SS @-@ officer Jürgen Stroop for his involvement in the bomb plot of 20 July . Von Kluge was succeeded by <unk> Walter Model , whose first act was to order the immediate retreat of the 7th Army and Fifth Panzer Army , while the II SS Panzer Corps with the remnants of four Panzer divisions , held the north face of the escape route against the British and Canadians and the XLVII Panzer Corps with what was left of two Panzer divisions , held the southern face against the Third U.S. Army 
 = = = Encirclement = = = 
 By 17 August the encirclement was incomplete . The 1st Polish Armoured Division , part of the First Canadian Army , was divided into three battlegroups and ordered to make a wide sweep to the south @-@ east , to meet American troops at Chambois . Trun fell to the 4th Canadian Armoured Division on 18 August . Having captured Champeaux on 19 August , the Polish battlegroups converged on Chambois and with reinforcements from the 4th Canadian Armoured Division , the Poles secured the town and linked up with the U.S. 90th and French 2nd Armoured divisions by evening . The Allies were not yet astride the 7th Army escape route in any great strength and their positions were attacked by German troops inside the pocket . An armoured column of the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert , took half the village and kept a road open for six hours until nightfall . Many Germans escaped and small parties made their way through to the Dives during the night . 
 Having taken Chambois , two of the Polish battlegroups drove north @-@ east and established themselves on part of Hill 262 ( Mont Ormel ridge ) , spending the night of 19 August digging in . The following morning , Model ordered elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division and 9th SS Panzer Division to attack from outside the pocket towards the Polish positions . Around midday , several units of the 10th SS Panzer Division , 12th SS Panzer Division and 116th Panzer Division managed to break through the Polish lines and open a corridor , while the 9th SS Panzer Division , prevented the Canadians from intervening . By mid @-@ afternoon , about 10 @,@ 000 German troops had passed out of the pocket . 
 The Poles held on to Hill 262 ( The Mace ) and were able from their vantage point , to direct artillery fire on to the retreating Germans . Hausser the 7th Army commander , ordered that the Polish positions be " eliminated " . The remnants of the 352nd Infantry Division and several battle groups from the 2nd SS Panzer Division , inflicted many casualties on the 8th and 9th battalions of the Polish Division but the assault was eventually repulsed at the cost of nearly all of their ammunition and the Poles watched as the remnants of the XLVII Panzer Corps escaped . During the night there was sporadic fighting and the Poles called for frequent artillery bombardments , to disrupt the German retreat from the sector . 
 German attacks resumed the next morning but the Poles retained their foothold on the ridge . At about 11 : 00 , a final attempt on the positions of the 9th Battalion was launched by nearby SS troops , which was defeated at close quarters . Soon after midday , the Canadian Grenadier Guards reached Mont Ormel and by late afternoon , the remainder of the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions had begun their retreat to the Seine . For the Falaise pocket operation , the 1st Polish Armoured Division listed 1 @,@ 441 casualties including 466 killed while Polish casualties at Mont Ormel were 351 killed and wounded , with eleven tanks lost . German losses in their assaults on the ridge were c . 500 dead and 1 @,@ 000 men taken prisoner , most from the 12th SS @-@ Panzer Division . Scores of Tiger , Panther and Panzer IV tanks were destroyed , along with many artillery pieces . 
 By the evening of 21 August , tanks of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division had linked with Polish forces at <unk> and the 3rd and 4th Canadian Infantry divisions had secured St. Lambert and the northern passage to Chambois ; the Falaise pocket had been sealed . Approximately 20 – 50 @,@ 000 German troops minus heavy equipment , escaped through the gap and were reorganized and rearmed , in time to slow the Allied advance into the Netherlands and Germany . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 The Battle of the Falaise Pocket ended the Battle of Normandy with a decisive German defeat . Hitler 's involvement had been damaging from the first , with his insistence on hopelessly unrealistic counter @-@ offensives , micro @-@ management of generals , and refusal to countenance withdrawal , when his armies were threatened with annihilation . More than forty German divisions were destroyed during the Battle of Normandy . No exact figures are available but historians estimate that the battle cost the German forces c . 450 @,@ 000 men , of whom 240 @,@ 000 were killed or wounded . The Allies had achieved victory at a cost of 209 @,@ 672 casualties among the ground forces , including 36 @,@ 976 killed and 19 @,@ 221 missing . The Allied air forces lost 16 @,@ 714 airmen killed or missing in connection with Operation Overlord . The final battle of Operation Overlord , the Liberation of Paris , followed on 25 August and Overlord ended by 30 August , with the retreat of the last German unit across the Seine . 
 The area in which the pocket had formed was full of the remains of battle . Villages had been destroyed and derelict equipment made some roads impassable . Corpses of soldiers and civilians littered the area along with thousands of dead cattle and horses . In the hot August weather , maggots crawled over the bodies and hordes of flies descended on the area . Pilots reported being able to smell the stench of the battlefield hundreds of feet above it . General Eisenhower recorded that ; 
 The battlefield at Falaise was unquestionably one of the greatest " killing fields " of any of the war areas . Forty @-@ eight hours after the closing of the gap I was conducted through it on foot , to encounter scenes that could be described only by Dante . It was literally possible to walk for hundreds of yards at a time , stepping on nothing but dead and decaying flesh . 
 Fear of infection from the rancid conditions led the Allies to declare the area an " unhealthy zone " . Clearing the area was a low priority though and went on until well into November . Many swollen bodies had to be shot to expunge gasses within them before they could be burnt and bulldozers were used to clear the area of dead animals . 
 Disappointed that a significant portion of the 7th Army had escaped from the pocket , many Allied commanders , particularly among the Americans , were critical of what they perceived as Montgomery 's lack of urgency in closing the pocket . Writing shortly after the war , Ralph Ingersoll — a prominent peacetime journalist , who had served as a planner on Eisenhower 's staff — expressed the prevailing American view at the time ; 
 The international army boundary arbitrarily divided the British and American battlefields just beyond Argentan , on the Falaise side of it . Patton 's troops , who thought they had the mission of closing the gap , took Argentan in their stride and crossed the international boundary without stopping . Montgomery , who was still nominally in charge of all ground forces , now chose to exercise his authority and ordered Patton back to his side of the international boundary line . … For ten days , however , the beaten but still coherently organized German Army retreated through the Falaise gap . 
 Some historians have thought that the gap could have been closed earlier ; Wilmot wrote that despite having British divisions in reserve , Montgomery did not reinforce Simonds and that the Canadian drive on Trun and Chambois was not " vigorous and venturesome " as the situation demanded . Hastings wrote that Montgomery , having witnessed what he called a poor Canadian performance during Totalize , should have brought up veteran British divisions to take the lead . D 'Este and <unk> wrote that Montgomery and Crerar might have done more to impart momentum to the British and Canadians . Patton 's post @-@ battle claim that the Americans could have prevented the German escape , had Bradley not ordered him to stop at Argentan , was " absurd over @-@ simplification " . 
 Wilmot wrote that " contrary to contemporary reports , the Americans did not capture Argentan until 20 August , the day after the link up at Chambois " . The American unit that closed the gap between Argentan and Chambois , the 90th Division , was according to Hastings , one of the least effective of any Allied army in Normandy . He speculated that the real reason Bradley halted Patton , was not fear of accidental clashes with the British but knowledge that , with powerful German formations still operational , the Americans lacked the means to defend an early blocking position and would have suffered an " embarrassing and gratuitous setback " , at the hands of the retreating Fallschirmjäger and the 2nd and 12th SS @-@ Panzer divisions . Bradley wrote after the war that ; 
 Although Patton might have spun a line across the narrow neck , I doubted his ability to hold it . Nineteen German divisions were now stampeding to escape the trap . Meanwhile , with four divisions George was already blocking three principal escape routes through <unk> , Sees and Argentan . Had he stretched that line to include Falaise , he would have extended his roadblock a distance of 40 miles ( 64 km ) . The enemy could not only have broken through , but he might have trampled Patton 's position in the onrush . I much preferred a solid shoulder at Argentan to the possibility of a broken neck at Falaise . 
 = = = Casualties = = = 
 By 22 August , all German forces west of the Allied lines were dead or in captivity . Historians differ in their estimates of German losses in the pocket . The majority state that from 80 @,@ 000 – 100 @,@ 000 troops were caught in the encirclement of whom 10 @,@ 000 – 15 @,@ 000 were killed , 40 @,@ 000 – 50 @,@ 000 were taken prisoner , and 20 @,@ 000 – 50 @,@ 000 escaped .

D 'Este gave 80 @,@ 000 troops trapped of whom 10 @,@ 000 were killed , 50 @,@ 000 captured and 20 @,@ 000 escaped . Shulman gives c . 80 @,@ 000 trapped , 10 – 15 @,@ 000 killed and 45 @,@ 000 captured . Wilmot recorded 100 @,@ 000 trapped , 10 @,@ 000 killed and 50 @,@ 000 captured .

In the northern sector , German losses included 344 tanks , self @-@ propelled guns and other light armoured vehicles , as well as 2 @,@ 447 soft @-@ skinned vehicles and 252 guns abandoned or destroyed . In the fighting around Hill 262 , German losses totalled 2 @,@ 000 men killed , 5 @,@ 000 taken prisoner and 55 tanks , 44 guns and 152 other armoured vehicles destroyed . The 12th SS @-@ Panzer Division had lost 94 percent of its armour , nearly all of its artillery and 70 percent of its vehicles . With close to 20 @,@ 000 men and 150 tanks before the Normandy campaign , after Falaise it was reduced to 300 men and 10 tanks . Although elements of several German formations had managed to escape to the east , even these had left behind most of their equipment . After the battle , Allied investigators estimated that the Germans lost around 500 tanks and assault guns in the pocket and that little of the extricated equipment survived the retreat across the Seine . 
 = Love It to Death = 
 Love It to Death is the third album by the American rock band Alice Cooper , released in March 1971 . It was the band 's first commercially successful album , and is considered to be where the band first consolidated its aggressive hard @-@ rocking sound . The album 's best @-@ known track , " I 'm Eighteen " , was released as a single to test the band 's commercial viability before the album was recorded . 
 Formed in the mid @-@ 1960s , the band took the name Alice Cooper in 1968 and became known for its outrageous theatrical live shows . The loose , psychedelic freak rock of the first two albums failed to find an audience . The band moved to Detroit in 1970 and was influenced by the aggressive hard rock scene there . A young Bob Ezrin was enlisted as producer , and he encouraged the band to tighten its songwriting over two months of rehearsing ten to twelve hours a day . The single " I 'm Eighteen " achieved top @-@ forty success soon after , peaking at number 21 . This convinced Warner Bros. that Alice Cooper had the commercial potential to release an album . After its release in March 1971 , Love It to Death reached number 35 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and has since been certified platinum . The album 's second single , " Caught in a Dream " , charted at number 94 . 
 The original album cover featured Cooper posed with his thumb protruding so it appeared to be his penis ; Warner Bros. soon replaced it with a censored version . The Love It to Death tour featured an elaborate shock rock live show : during " Ballad of Dwight Fry " — about an inmate in an insane asylum — Cooper would be dragged offstage and return in a straitjacket , and the show climaxed with Cooper 's mock execution in a prop electric chair during " Black Juju " . Ezrin and the Coopers continued to work together for a string of hit albums until the band 's breakup in 1974 . The album has come to be seen as a foundational influence on hard rock , punk , and heavy metal ; several tracks have become live Alice Cooper standards and are frequently covered by other bands . 
 = = Background = = 
 Detroit @-@ born vocalist Vincent Furnier co @-@ formed the Earwigs in the mid @-@ 1960s in Phoenix , Arizona , with guitarist Glen Buxton , guitarist and keyboardist Michael Bruce , bassist Dennis Dunaway , and drummer Neal Smith . The band released a few singles in 1967 after a name change to the Spiders . In 1968 the band adopted the name Alice Cooper — a name Furnier later adopted as his own — and presented a story that it came from a 17th @-@ century witch whose name they learned from a session with a <unk> board . 
 At some point Buxton painted circles under his eyes with cigarette ashes , and soon the rest followed with ghoulish black makeup and outlandish clothes . The band moved to Los Angeles and became known for its provocative , theatrical shock rock stage show . In an incident during a performance at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival in 1969 , Cooper threw a live chicken into the audience , who tore it to shreds . 
 The group 's first two albums , <unk> for You ( 1969 ) and Easy Action ( 1970 ) , appeared on Frank Zappa 's Straight Records label , and failed to find an audience . The band relocated to Detroit and found itself in the midst of a music scene populated with the hard @-@ driving rock of the MC5 , the stage @-@ diving Iggy Pop with the Stooges , and the theatricality of George Clinton 's Parliament and Funkadelic . The Alice Cooper band incorporated these influences into a tight hard @-@ rock sound coupled with an outrageous live show . 
 While at the Strawberry Fields Festival in Canada in April 1970 , band manager Shep Gordon contacted producer Jack Richardson , who had produced hit singles for the Guess Who . Richardson was uninterested in producing the Alice Cooper band himself , and sent nineteen @-@ year @-@ old Bob Ezrin in his place . Cooper recalled the young junior producer as " a nineteen @-@ year @-@ old Jewish hippie " who reacted to meeting the outlandish band " as if he had just opened a surprise package and found a box full of maggots " . 
 Ezrin initially turned down working with the band , but changed his mind when he saw them perform at Max 's Kansas City in New York City the following October . Ezrin was impressed with the band 's audience @-@ participation rock @-@ theater performance and the cult @-@ like devotion of the band 's fans , who dressed up and knew the lyrics and actions to the music , which Ezrin compared to the later cult following of The Rocky Horror Picture Show . Ezrin returned to Toronto to convince Richardson to take on the band ; Richardson did not want to work directly with such a group but agreed on condition that Ezrin took the lead . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 The band and Ezrin did pre @-@ production for the album in Pontiac , Michigan , in November and December 1970 , and recorded at the RCA Mid @-@ American Recording Center in Chicago in December . Richardson and Ezrin produced the album for Richardson 's Nimbus 9 Productions , with Richardson as executive producer . 
 Ezrin , with his classical and folk background , attempted to have the band tighten the loosely structured songs . The band resisted at first but came to see things Ezrin 's way , and ten to twelve hours a day of rehearsal resulted in a tight set of hard rock songs with little of the psychedelic freak @-@ rock aesthetic of the first two albums . According to Cooper , Ezrin " ironed the songs out note by note , giving them coloring , personality " . Ezrin rearranged " I 'm Eighteen " from an eight @-@ minute jam piece called " I Wish I Was 18 Again " to a taut three @-@ minute rocker . 
 Both Buxton and Bruce used Gibson SG guitars and tended to double up , playing similar parts with subtle differences in phrasing and tone . Dunaway often played a moving counter @-@ melody bass part , rather than following the typical rock strategy of holding to the chord 's root . 
 Zappa had sold Straight Records to Warner Bros. in 1970 for $ 50 @,@ 000 . That November the group released a single of " I 'm Eighteen " backed with " Is It My Body " ; and Warner Bros. agreed to allow the group to proceed with an album if the single sold well . The band posed as fans and made hundreds of calls to radio stations to request the song , and Gordon is said to have paid others a dollar per radio request . Soon the song was on the airwaves across the US — even on mainstream AM radio — and peaked at number 21 on the charts . The success of the single convinced Warner to contract Richardson to produce Love It to Death — one of the first times an American producer assigned a Canadian to produce an album . 
 Ezrin was intent on developing a cohesive sound for the album , and his earnestness was a source of humor for the band . At a time when the Beatles had a reputation that made them seem beyond criticism , the Alice Cooper band intended " Second Coming " as a jab at the recently released track " The Long and Winding Road " with Phil Spector 's elaborate production — the hyperbolic acclaim it received struck the band as if it were the Second Coming of a master composer on the order of Beethoven — as well as Ezrin 's attempts to bring such production values to Alice Cooper 's music . Ezrin did not realize the joke was largely at his expense . When recording the " I wanna get out of here " sequence of " Ballad of Dwight Fry " , Ezrin had Cooper lie on the floor surrounded by a cage of metal chairs . " Black Juju " was the only track recorded live in the studio . " I 'm Eighteen " was a sixteen @-@ track recording at 15 IPS ; other tracks were recorded at 30 IPS . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 A dark , aggressive song whose lumbering , distorted guitar riff is in E minor , " I 'm Eighteen " was the band 's first hit . In raspy vocals against arpeggiated guitar backing , the lyrics describe the existential anguish of being at the cusp of adulthood , decrying in each verse being " in the middle " of something , such as " life " or " doubt " . The chorus switches to a series of power chords building from A , the vocals proclaiming : " I 'm eighteen / And I don 't know what I want ... I gotta get out of this place / I 'll go runnin ' in outer space " . The song turns around at the conclusion with an embrace of those things that had caused such anguish : " I 'm eighteen and I like it ! " 
 " I 'm Eighteen " comes between two straight @-@ ahead rockers : " Long Way to Go " and album opener " Caught in a Dream " . Both follow simple hard @-@ rock formulas , trading heavy riffing with guitar fills and solos . The album title derives from lyrics in " Long Way to Go " . " Caught in a Dream " was the album 's second single and features irreverent , tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek lyrics such as " I need everything the world owes me / I tell that to myself and I agree " . The first side closes with " Black Juju " by bassist Dunaway , a lengthy track in the vein of The Doors , and Pink Floyd 's " Interstellar Overdrive " — both bands Alice Cooper earlier had opened for — with an organ part derived from Pink Floyd 's " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun " . The band named the song after a stray dog in Pontiac . 
 " Is It My Body " , the B @-@ side to the " I 'm Eighteen " single , opens the second side of the album . The verses pose the questions : " What have I got ? / That makes you want to love me ? / Is it my body ? " — and declare in the chorus : " Have you got the time to find out / Who I really am ? " " Hallowed Be My Name " follows with lyrics such as " Screaming at mothers / <unk> the Bible " . " Second Coming " continues on the theme of religion : " ... have no other gods before me / I 'm the light / The devil 's getting smarter all the time " The track developed from one of Cooper 's lyrical fragments — " Time is getting closer / I read it on a poster " — and is set to a delicate piano by Ezrin . 
 " The Ballad of Dwight Fry " is a dramatic piece about the inmate of a mental asylum . It opens with a young girl 's voice asking if her " Daddy " will " ever come home " , against a childlike piano backdrop . The song shifts to acoustic guitar and Cooper singing presumably in the persona of the girl 's father , at first in a wavering almost @-@ whisper . His voice builds with his persona 's increasing instability , eventually shouting in the heavy , guitar @-@ backed chorus : " See my only mind explode / Since I 've gone away " . After the second chorus there is a softer , creepy keyboard break by Buxton , and when the vocals reappear they repeat " I wanna get out of here " , at first tentative and imploring , before climaxing in the character 's total mental breakdown and a return to the chorus . The song 's main character is named for Dwight Frye , an actor Hollywood media dubbed " the man with the thousand @-@ watt stare " who portrayed <unk> , the lunatic slave of the titular vampire in the 1931 film Dracula starring Bela Lugosi . 
 The album closes with a cover of " Sun Arise " by Australian entertainer Rolf Harris . The upbeat pop song had been a show @-@ opener for the band throughout 1970 , and contrasts with the darkness of the rest of the album . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 " I 'm Eighteen " was the band 's first top 40 in the US , a success that led to a recording deal with Warner Bros. Records . It spent eight weeks on the US charts , peaking at number 21 . In Canada it broke the top ten , peaking at number 7 . 
 Love It to Death was released on March 8 , 1971 ; a British release of the album followed in June on the Straight label . Love It to Death was the first of the band 's albums on which the members received individual credit for songs ; previously the band as a whole was credited with all material . Though the original sleeve stated that the album was a Straight release , Straight had already been purchased by Warner Bros and the album bore Warner disc labels . The album reached number 35 on the US album charts , number 28 in Britain , and number 34 in Canada . The RIAA certified the album gold on November 6 , 1972 , and platinum on July 30 , 2001 . Alice Cooper was the first band on Warner Music Canada 's roster to sell more than 100 @,@ 000 copies each of four albums in Canada . In 1973 the band was awarded platinum albums in Canada for Love It to Death , Killer , School 's Out , and Billion Dollar Babies . The album first appeared on CD in October 1990 . 
 The original cover shows the long @-@ haired band members in dresses and makeup , and Cooper holding a cape around himself with his thumb sticking out to give the illusion of an exposed penis . This led Warner Bros. to censor it — first that December by covering it with white strips , then by having the photo touched up with paint in pressings beginning in 1972 . Both front and back cover photos were taken by Roger <unk> , credited as " <unk> " . The gatefold features a close @-@ up photo by Dave Griffith of Cooper 's eyes heavily made @-@ up with spidery eyelashes ; in his pupils appear photos of the other band members . 
 " Caught in a Dream " was released as a single backed with " Hallowed Be My Name " on April 27 , 1971 ; it peaked in the US at number 94 . The group supported the album with extensive touring . " Ballad of Dwight Fry " was a dramatized set piece in the live show , featuring an actress dressed as a nurse who dragged Cooper offstage and brought him back on straitjacketed in time for the second verse 's " <unk> ' don 't come very easy / In a strait white vest " . At the song 's climax , Cooper would break free of the straitjacket and hurl it into the audience . The Love It to Death tour of 1971 featured an electric chair in the earliest staged executions of the singer . These executions were to become an attraction of the band 's shows , which became progressively more flamboyant ; the shows in the Billion Dollar Babies tour of 1973 concluded with Cooper 's execution by prop guillotine . The Love It to Death tour grossed so much the band bought a forty @-@ two room mansion from Ann @-@ Margret in Greenwich , Connecticut , which was to be its home base for the next few years . 
 The album garnered mixed reviews . Billboard called the album " artfully absurd third @-@ generation rock " and the group " the first stars of future rock " . John Mendelsohn gave the album a favorable review in Rolling Stone , writing that it " represents at least a modest oasis in the desert of dreary blue @-@ <unk> aloofness served up in concert by most American rock @-@ and @-@ rollers . " However , referring to " Black Juju " he also said that " the one bummer on this album is so loud a bummer that it may threaten to neutralize the ingratiating effect " of the other tracks . Robert Christgau rated it B − , stating that he " never would have figured this theatre type to come up with it " and calling " I 'm Eighteen " " as archetypal a hard rock single as you 're liable to hear in this flaccid year , or maybe ever " . 
 The band saw its popularity rise over the next several albums . Killer followed in November 1971 and reached number 21 on the US charts , and the band finally topped those charts in 1973 with its sixth album , Billion Dollar Babies . Unreleased demos of Love It to Death have circulated among fans ; highlights include outtakes of " Ballad of Dwight Fry " with alternate lyrics , and early versions of " You Drive Me Nervous " , which did not have an official release until it appeared on Killer . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Love It to Death is seen as one of the foundational albums of the heavy metal sound , along with contemporary releases by Black Sabbath , Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple , and others . A review in British magazine Melody Maker called it " an album for the punk and <unk> crowd " a few years before punk rock became a phenomenon . Pioneer punk band the Ramones found inspiration in Alice Cooper 's music and Love It to Death in particular . Vocalist Joey Ramone based the group 's first song , " I Don 't Care " , on the chords of the main riff to " I 'm Eighteen " . John Lydon wrote the song " Seventeen " on the Sex Pistols album Never Mind the Bollocks in response to " I 'm Eighteen " , and is said to have auditioned for the Sex Pistols by miming to an Alice Cooper song — most frequently reported as " I 'm Eighteen " . Love It to Death inspired Pat Smear to pick up the guitar at age twelve ; he went on to co @-@ found the Germs , tour as second guitarist for Nirvana , and play rhythm guitar for the Foo Fighters . 
 Hit Parader included Love It to Death in its heavy metal Hall of Fame in 1982 , and placed the album twenty @-@ first on its list of " Top 100 Metal Albums " in 1989 . In 2003 it was ranked # 452 on Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . Greg Prato of AllMusic called Love It to Death " an incredibly consistent listen from beginning to end " and " the release when everything began to come together for the band " . To Pete Prown and Harvey Newquist , the groups 's theatrical arrangements help its two guitarists " [ transcend ] the all @-@ too @-@ common clichés " in their the simple hard @-@ rock riffing and soloing " that were part and parcel of early seventies rock " . 
 The band was pleased with the collaboration with Ezrin , and he remained their producer until Cooper 's first solo album , Welcome to My Nightmare in 1975 . Love It to Death launched Ezrin 's own production career , which went on to include prominent albums such as Aerosmith 's Get Your Wings ( 1974 ) , Kiss 's Destroyer ( 1976 ) , and Pink Floyd 's The Wall ( 1979 ) . 
 Songs from Love It to Death continued to be frequent requests long after Cooper went solo . In response , when writing material for his 1989 album Trash , Cooper and producer Desmond Child spent time listening to Love it to Death and the band 's 1974 Greatest Hits album to " find that vibe and match it to " a style appropriate to the 1990s . 
 Thrash metal band Anthrax included a cover of " I 'm Eighteen " on its debut album Fistful of Metal in 1984 . Alternative metal band the Melvins covered " Second Coming " and " Ballad of Dwight Fry " on their album <unk> in 1992 . The song " Dreamin ' " on the 1998 Kiss album Psycho Circus bears such a resemblance to " I 'm Eighteen " that a month after the album 's release Cooper 's publisher filed a plagiarism suit , settled out of court in Cooper 's favor . Swedish death metal band Entombed released an EP in 1999 entitled Black Juju that included a cover of " Black Juju " . 
 Alternative rock band Sonic Youth recorded covers of " Ballad of Dwight Fry " , " Hallowed Be My Name " ( as " Hallowed Be Thy Name " ) , and " Is It My Body " — the latter of which is bassist Kim Gordon 's favorite of her own vocal performances . Gordon used the song 's title for a 1993 essay on the artist Mike Kelley , in which she described the Coopers as " anti @-@ hippie [ s ] reveling in the aesthetics of the ugly " . The essay appeared in 2014 in a collection by Gordon also titled Is It My Body ?

 = The Great Otis Redding Sings Soul Ballads = 
 The Great Otis Redding Sings Soul Ballads , simply referred to as Soul Ballads or Sings Soul Ballads , is the second studio album by American soul singer @-@ songwriter Otis Redding , released in 1965 . The album was one of the first issued by Volt Records , a sub @-@ label of Stax Records , and Redding 's first on the new label . Like Redding 's debut Pain in My Heart , Soul Ballads features both soul classics and originals written by Redding and other Stax Records recording artists . The recording sessions took place at the Stax studios in Memphis . The album features a stereo mixer made by engineer Tom Dowd , replacing the early mono mixer . 
 The album features the Booker T. & the M.G. ' s , the horn section Memphis Horns and the pianist Isaac Hayes , who possibly first appeared on this album , although this is disputed , as he was not credited on the liner notes . Unlike Redding 's debut album , Sings Soul Ballads was released both on Atlantic 's subsidiary Atco Records and Stax 's Volt Records . While the album and its singles were moderately successful on the music charts , it includes Redding 's first top @-@ ten single , " Mr. Pitiful " . The album received mixed critical reception . 
 = = Recording = = 
 The recording session took place at the Stax studios in Memphis . Guitarist Steve Cropper and Stax producer Jim Stewart both agreed with engineer Tom Dowd 's decision to install a two @-@ track recorder during the recording of " Mr. Pitiful " . The stereo four @-@ input Ampex mixer is used throughout the album , which means that the instrumentation is either in one channel or the other , but the vocals and echo are in only one channel . This is different for mono recordings , where only one channel is used . Sings Soul Ballads features Booker T. & the M.G. ' s organist Booker T. Jones , pianist / guitarist Steve Cropper , bassist Donald " Duck " Dunn , drummer Al Jackson , Jr . , and the Memphis Horns , consisting of trumpeter Wayne Jackson , tenor saxophonist Charles " <unk> " Axton and baritone saxophonist Floyd Newman . The album contains 12 songs , the majority of which are , as the album 's name implies , soul ballads . 
 The album opens with " That 's How Strong My Love Is " . Written by Roosevelt Jamison and altered by Cropper , the song was first performed by O. V. Wright on <unk> Records , where the song was cut by both Jamison and Wright . Redding 's version was released days after the original . The Rolling Stones covered the song shortly afterward and included it on their album Out of Our Heads . Isaac Hayes made his debut as a pianist with Otis Redding , possibly on songs " Come to Me " or " Security " . It is unclear because prior to 1966 , the Memphis Musicians Union kept little or no sessions documentation ; Fantasy Records , who bought Stax in 1977 , has none at all prior to 1966 . That Hayes debuted in 1964 with Redding is known ; which song remains in question . " Come to Me " , Redding 's fourth Volt single , was written by Cropper and Phil Walden and became the second song after the Volt session not to feature a horn section . The song is a typical 6 / 8 ballad and features piano triplets , including an organ . The single peaked at number 69 on Billboard 's Hot 100 chart . 
 " Mr. Pitiful " was recorded in December 1964 at the Stax studios . The song was written by both guitarist Steve Cropper and Redding , and was their first collaboration . It was inspired by and written as a response to a statement made by radio disc jockey <unk> Williams , who had nicknamed Redding " Mr. Pitiful " for sounding pitiful when singing ballads . Cropper heard about this and , while taking a shower , got the idea it would make a good song . In the car on the way to the studio , Cropper proposed the idea with a melody already in mind , humming it to Redding . By the time they reached the studio , the song was written and they recorded it in two or three takes . It was released as a single with the B @-@ side " That 's How Strong My Love Is " . The song became a hit and the album 's most successful track , peaking at number 10 on the Billboard R & B and at number 41 on Billboard Hot 100 chart .

 Sings Soul Ballads was released on March 1965 , with four of the songs from the album chosen to be released as singles . Unlike Redding 's first studio album , Pain in My Heart , the album was released both on Atlantic 's subsidiary Atco Records and Stax 's Volt Records . A remastered CD and CS version was released by Atco on the Elektra label in 1991 . On March 8 , 2002 , 4 Men With Beards released a vinyl version . Rhino / Atlantic issued a digital download release in the MP3 format on July 29 , 2008 .

 Sings Soul Ballads received mixed critical reception . Lindsay Planer from Allmusic gave a mixed review of the album . While she liked " That 's How Strong My Love Is " , Chuck Willis ' " It 's Too Late " , " For Your Precious Love " ( previously a hit by The Impressions ) , Sam Cooke 's " Nothing Can Change This Love " , and Cropper 's / Redding 's " Mr. Pitiful " , she was less enthusiastic about " Chained and Bound " , " I Want to Thank You " and " A Woman , a Lover , a Friend " , which mimic aspects of Cooke 's sound . The second was compared with " Another Saturday Night " , the latter with " Everybody Loves to Cha Cha Cha " . She gave the album three of five stars . The Rolling Stone Album Guide , on the other hand , gave the album five stars .

 = HMS Brazen ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Brazen was a B @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy around 1930 . Initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet , she was transferred to Home Fleet in 1936 . The ship escorted convoys and conducted anti @-@ submarine patrols early in World War II before participating in the Norwegian Campaign in April – May 1940 . Brazen later began escorting coastal convoys in the English Channel and was sunk in late July 1940 by German aircraft whilst doing so . 
 = = Description = = 
 Brazen displaced 1 @,@ 360 long tons ( 1 @,@ 380 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 790 long tons ( 1 @,@ 820 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 32 feet 3 inches ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 3 inches ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 35 knots ( 65 km / h ; 40 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . Brazen carried a maximum of 390 long tons ( 400 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 134 officers and enlisted men , although it increased to 142 during wartime . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre QF 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Brazen had two 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on a platform between her funnels . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . 
 = = Career = = 
 The ship was ordered on 22 March 1929 from Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at Hebburn under the 1928 Naval Programme . She was laid down on 22 July 1929 , and launched on 25 July 1930 , as the seventh RN ship to carry this name . Brazen was completed on 8 April 1931 at a cost of £ 220 @,@ 342 , excluding items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns , ammunition and communications equipment . After her commissioning , she was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet until the end of 1935 . The ship received a refit at Devonport from August to October 1933 and another at Malta a few months later . Brazen was assigned to the Home Fleet in 1936 and participated in the effort to rescue the crew of the submarine Thetis which had sunk during sea trials on 1 June 1939 . 
 The ship was reassigned to the 19th Destroyer Flotilla in August , shortly before World War II began . She spent the next seven months escorting convoys and patrolling in the English Channel and the North Sea . On 13 October , Brazen rescued three survivors from German submarine U @-@ 40 which had sunk after striking a mine a few hours earlier . The ship , together with the destroyer Encounter , assumed the escort of Convoy <unk> after the destroyer Daring had been sunk by U @-@ 23 . Later that day she rescued some survivors from the Norwegian merchant ship <unk> . Brazen escorted the capital ships of the Home Fleet as they sortied into the North Sea on 7 April and continued that duty for the next several weeks . The ship was detached to escort a troop convoy to Namsos on 13 April and sank U @-@ 49 two days later with the destroyer Fearless near Harstad , Norway . The two destroyers rescued 41 of the submarine 's crew . Brazen escorted several more convoys to and from Norway over the next several weeks . 
 On 30 May , the ship was en route to Harwich when she struck some submerged wreckage and suffered damage that required five weeks to repair . Brazen was transferred to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla , based at Dover , upon their completion , where she began escorting coastal convoys . Whilst escorting Convoy <unk> on 20 July , during the initial phase of the Battle of Britain , the ship was attacked by German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers belonging to II . / Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 ( Dive Bomber Wing 1 — or StG 1 ) . The shock effect from several near misses broke her keel and then she was hit in the engine room . Brazen sank at position 51 ° 01 ′ 05 ″ N 01 ° 17 ′ 15 ″ E at 20 : 40 . Only one member of her crew was killed during the attack and her gunners claimed to have shot down three Ju 87s . German records confirm only two losses — both fell to defending British fighter aircraft . 
 = George Washington in the French and Indian War = 
 George Washington ( February 22 , 1732 – December 14 , 1799 ) commanded the Continental Army in American Revolutionary War ( 1775 – 1783 ) , and was the first President of the United States , serving from 1789 to 1797 . Because of his central role in the founding of the United States , Washington is often called the " Father of his Country " . His devotion to republicanism and civic virtue made him an exemplary figure among early American politicians . 
 Washington 's military experience began in the French and Indian War with a commission as a major in the militia of the British Province of Virginia . In 1753 Washington was sent as an ambassador from the British crown to the French officials and Indians as far north as present @-@ day Erie , Pennsylvania . The following year he led another expedition to the area to assist in the construction of a fort at present @-@ day Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . Before reaching that point , he and some of his men , accompanied by Indian allies , ambushed a French scouting party . Its leader was killed , although the exact circumstances of his death were disputed . This peacetime act of aggression is seen as one of the first military steps leading to the global Seven Years ' War . The French responded by attacking fortifications Washington erected following the ambush , forcing his surrender . Released on parole , Washington and his troops returned to Virginia . 
 In 1755 he participated as a volunteer aide in the ill @-@ fated expedition of General Edward Braddock , where he distinguished himself in the retreat following the climactic Battle of Monongahela . He served from 1755 until 1758 as colonel and commander of the Virginia Regiment , directing the provincial defenses against French and Indian raids and building the regiment into one of the best @-@ trained provincial militias of the time . He led the regiment as part of the 1758 expedition of General John Forbes that successfully drove the French from Fort Duquesne , during which he and some of his companies were involved in a friendly fire incident . Unable to get a commission in the British Army , Washington then resigned from the provincial militia , married , and took up the life of a Virginia plantation owner . 
 Washington gained valuable military skills during the war , acquiring tactical , strategic , and logistical military experience . He also acquired important political skills in his dealings with the British military establishment and the provincial government . His military exploits , although they included some notable failures , made his military reputation in the colonies such that he became a natural selection as the commander in chief of the Continental Army following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775 . His successes in military and political spheres during that conflict led to his election as the first President of the United States of America . 
 = = Background = = 
 Born into a well @-@ to @-@ do Virginia family near Fredericksburg in 1732 [ O.S. 1731 ] , Washington was schooled locally until the age of 15 . The early death of his father when he was 11 eliminated the possibility of schooling in England , and his mother rejected attempts to place him in the Royal Navy . Thanks to the connection by marriage of his half @-@ brother Lawrence to the wealthy Fairfax family , Washington was appointed surveyor of Culpeper County in 1749 ; he was just 17 years old . Washington 's brother had purchased an interest in the Ohio Company , a land acquisition and settlement company whose objective was the settlement of Virginia 's frontier areas , including the Ohio Country , territory north and west of the Ohio River . Its investors also included Virginia 's Royal Governor , Robert Dinwiddie , who appointed Washington a major in the provincial militia in February 1753 . 
 = = Emissary = = 
 The Ohio Country was occupied by a variety of Indian tribes that were nominally under the suzerainty of the Iroquois Confederacy based in what is now northwestern New York . The area was also the subject of several conflicting claims by British and French colonies . The British provinces of Virginia and Pennsylvania both claimed the area , and traders from Pennsylvania had been trading with the Indians at least since the early 1740s . In 1752 , representatives of the Ohio Company reached an agreement with the local Indian leaders allowing the construction of a fort and a small settlement at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers ( present @-@ day Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania ) , and for the establishment of some settlements south of the Ohio River . The French were alarmed by these developments , and in 1753 began the construction of a series of fortifications in the uppermost headwaters of the Ohio River ( near present @-@ day Erie , Pennsylvania ) , intending to extend the line of forts downriver and deny British traders and settlers access to the territory . When news of this reached Virginia , Governor Dinwiddie sought advice from the British government in London . He received orders to send a messenger to the French , reiterating British claims and demanding that they stop construction of their forts and quit the territory . 
 Governor Dinwiddie chose Major Washington , then 21 years old , for the trek into the Ohio Country to assess the French military situation , and to deliver the British demands . He was a good choice despite his youth because he was familiar with the frontier from survey work , had good health , and both government and Ohio Company leaders trusted Washington . Although he had no frontier warfare experience , neither did most other Virginians . Washington departed from Williamsburg at the end of October 1753 . In Fredericksburg he picked up Jacob Van Braam , a family friend who spoke French , before heading into the Virginia highlands . There he was joined by Christopher Gist , an Ohio Company agent who was familiar with the territory , and a few backwoodsmen to assist with expedition logistics . When the expedition arrived at the site of the proposed fort , Washington noted that the site was well chosen , having " the entire Command of the Monongahela " . 
 The expedition then proceeded on to Logstown , a large Indian settlement a short way down the Ohio River . After parleying with the Indians , the Mingo " Half King " Tanacharison and three of his men agreed to accompany the British expedition to meet with the French . Washington also learned that many of the Ohio tribes were as unhappy about the British plans for settling the area as they were of the French plans to fortify it . Leaving Logstown on November 30 , they arrived at Fort <unk> on December 4 . The commander there , Captain Philippe @-@ Thomas de Joncaire , directed Washington to his superior officer , stationed at Fort LeBoeuf , further north . While dining with Joncaire , Washington learned of French intentions to " take possession of the Ohio " . 
 Washington 's party reached Fort LeBoeuf on December 11 , in the middle of a raging snowstorm . The French commander , Captain Jacques Legardeur de Saint @-@ Pierre , received them with hospitality ; however , in response to Dinwiddie 's demands , he pointed out that the letter was more properly addressed to his superior , New France 's governor the Marquis Duquesne . The letter Legardeur drafted in response to Dinwiddie 's was clear and to the point : " as to the summons you send me to retire , I do not think myself obliged to obey it . " Washington took careful notes of the military arrangements at both forts before departing on December 16 . He was somewhat concerned by the fact that Tanacharison and his men remained behind for further discussions with the French ; he wrote , " I saw that every strategem which the most fruitful brain could invent , was practiced to win Half King to their interest " . He returned to Williamsburg after a month of difficult travel . Dinwiddie had Washington 's account of the expedition widely distributed to emphasize the French threat . It was printed on both sides of the Atlantic , giving Washington an international reputation . 
 = = Jumonville and Fort Necessity = = 
 While Washington was returning from this expedition , Dinwiddie sent men from the Ohio Company ( who were also commissioned into the provincial militia ) under William Trent to begin construction of the company 's fort . In February , with Tanacharison 's blessing , Trent and his men began construction of the fort at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers . Legardeur 's successor at Venango , Claude @-@ Pierre <unk> de Contrecœur , led a force of about 500 men Canadiens and Indians ( rumors reaching Trent 's men put its size at 1 @,@ 000 ) to dislodge them . On April 16 , they arrived at the forks ; the next day , Trent 's force of 36 men , led by Ensign Edward Ward in Trent 's absence , agreed to leave the site , over the vociferous objections of Tanacharison . The French then began construction of Fort Duquesne . 
 Washington , upon his return to Williamsburg , was commissioned a Lieutenant Colonel in the newly created Virginia Regiment , and ordered by Dinwiddie to raise a force to assist in the completion of Trent 's fort . Dinwiddie 's orders were to " act on the [ defensive ] , but in Case any Attempts are made to obstruct the Works or interrupt our [ settlements ] by any Persons whatsoever , You are to restrain all such Offenders , & in Case of resistance to make Prisoners of or kill and destroy them . " Historian Fred Anderson describes Dinwiddie 's instructions , which were issued without the knowledge or direction of the British government , as " an invitation to start a war . " Washington was ordered to gather up as many supplies and paid volunteers as he could along the way . By the time he left for the frontier on April 2 , he had recruited fewer than 160 men . Moving quickly and without artillery , his force marched north and west , picking up additional militia companies along the way . On April 19 , outside Winchester , Virginia , Washington received word that a large French force was descending the Allegheny . On reaching Wills Creek he met part of Trent 's company , who , in addition to confirming the arrival of the French , brought a supportive message from Tanacharison . To keep Tanacharison 's support , Washington decided to advance rather than turning back . However , road @-@ building went slowly , and by the end of May Washington 's company had reached a place known as the Great Meadows ( now in Fayette County , Pennsylvania ) , about 37 miles ( 60 km ) south of the forks . There he began construction of a small fort and awaited further news or instructions . 
 On May 23 , Contrecœur , now in command at Fort Duquesne , sent Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville with 35 Canadiens to see if Washington had entered French territory , and with a summons to order Washington 's troops out ; this summons was similar in nature to the one Washington had delivered to them in 1753 . On May 27 , Washington was told by Christopher Gist that a French party numbering about 50 was in the area . In response , Washington sent 75 men with Gist to find them . That evening , Washington received a message from Tanacharison , informing him that he had found the Canadien camp , and that the two of them should meet . Despite the fact that he had just sent another group in pursuit of the French , Washington went with a detachment of 40 men to meet with Tanacharison . The Mingo leader had with him 12 warriors , two of whom were boys . After discussing the matter , the two leaders agreed to make an attack on the Canadiens . 
 Washington and Tanacharison then ambushed Jumonville 's party , sneaking up and surrounding the French camp . Some were still asleep , others preparing breakfast , when without warning , Washington gave the order to fire . Those who escaped the volley scrambled for their weapons , but were swiftly overwhelmed . Ten of the French , including Jumonville , were killed , one was wounded , and all but one ( who escaped to warn the French commander at Fort Duquesne ) of the rest were taken prisoner . 
 The exact circumstances of Jumonville 's death are disputed . Contrecœur claimed that Jumonville and most of the other wounded French were massacred in cold blood by British musket fire after having surrendered ; Washington claimed in his account that Jumonville was killed , but did not give any details . Other accounts claimed that Tanacharison tomahawked Jumonville while he ( Jumonville ) was reading the summons . When the British left the battlefield to return to their camp at Great Meadows , they did not bury any of the French dead . 
 Washington then finished building Fort Necessity at the Great Meadows , anticipating a French counterattack . The fort , completed June 2 , was not much more than a wooden stockade 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) high and about 50 feet ( 15 m ) in diameter surrounded by a ditch . It was so poorly sited ( surrounded by higher hills and woods providing cover to the enemy ) that Tanacharison tried to point out its defects . Washington dismissed these concerns , convinced the fort could withstand " the attack of 500 Indians . " Over the next month , his force grew by 200 men from Virginia and an independent company of 100 British regulars that had marched up from South Carolina , while he continued to build the road toward the forks . The arriving Virginians brought congratulations from Governor Dinwiddie on his success at Jumonville Glen , and word that Washington had been promoted to colonel , owing to the death of Colonel Joshua Fry in a fall from his horse . 
 While the road building went on , Washington pressed Tanacharison for more Indian support . However , the Half King seemed to have lost confidence in the British cause , and he and his followers soon abandoned the British camp . This complete loss of Indian support prompted Washington to withdraw his work crews back to Fort Necessity . Not long afterward , a force of 700 French and Indians surrounded the fort , and Washington was soon compelled to surrender . The surrender document that Washington signed prevented his men from returning to the Ohio Country for one year , and included an admission that Jumonville had been " assassinated " . ( The document was written in French , which Washington could not read , and may have been poorly translated for him . ) Because the French claimed that Jumonville 's party had been on a diplomatic ( rather than military ) mission , the " Jumonville affair " became an international incident , and the military escalation that followed blossomed into the global Seven Years ' War . Although most Virginians were not particularly critical , there was rumbling about Washington 's actions in other quarters . One New Yorker wrote that Washington acted rashly and that he was " too ambitious of acquiring all the honor " , while London commentators dismissed the failure casually , citing a lack of colonial military experience . Governor Dinwiddie was publicly supportive of Washington , but criticized him privately , noting that some of the Virginia Regiment 's problems originated in a " want of proper Command " . Dinwiddie assigned command of a follow @-@ up expedition ( that never actually reached the Ohio Country ) to North Carolina militia colonel James Innes . In another step that may have been calculated to clip the young colonel 's wings , Dinwiddie reorganized the Virginia Regiment into separate companies , with no ranks above captain ; Washington resigned rather than accept a demotion . 
 = = Braddock 's Defeat = = 
 In 1755 , as part of the British military escalation , Major General Edward Braddock arrived in North America with a force of British Army regulars to head a major effort against the French in the Ohio Country . Washington wanted to serve on the expedition , but refused to do so as a provincial officer , since he would be outranked by even junior officers in the regular army establishment . ( Washington was said to " [ bubble ] with fury when British regular officers expressed their disdain of provincial officers and soldiers " , and at the realization that British officers were always senior to colonials regardless of rank . ) Through negotiations mediated by Governor Dinwiddie , Washington was offered an unpaid volunteer position as one of Braddock 's aides . Washington accepted , writing to Braddock 's principal aide , Captain Robert Orme , " I wish for nothing more earnestly , than to attain a small degree of knowledge in the Military Art " , and that the position would provide him " a good opportunity ... of forming an acquaintance which may be serviceable hereafter , if I can find it worth while pushing my Fortune in the Military way . " 
 When Braddock 's regulars arrived in Alexandria , Washington spent much time there , observing infantry drills and other internal workings of the army , and even copied Braddock 's orders to absorb the style in which they were written . The expedition finally marched off in April 1755 , and made extremely slow progress along the road Washington had cut in 1754 , owing to the heavy artillery and long baggage train . Braddock and his entourage arrived at Fort Cumberland on May 10 . From there the progress slowed even further as the army made its way to the Monongahela River . Washington fell ill with dysentery en route , and only rejoined the column on July 8 , when it was nearing the Monongahela . 
 The next day , after Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gage 's light infantry had crossed the Monongahela about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Fort Duquesne , they stumbled into a French and Indian force that had been sent to locate them . Both sides were surprised , but the French and Indians quickly organized themselves and made a vicious onslaught against the British . Gage 's men , and the work crews they were guarding , turned and fled in a panic , right into the arriving column of regulars , which included Braddock and his entourage . The discipline of the British regulars broke down , and a panicked retreat began , with the French and Indians firing at them from the cover of the surrounding woods . Braddock lost several horses , and eventually went down with a mortal wound . Washington was one of the few of Braddock 's aides to emerge relatively unscathed , despite being significantly involved in the fighting . He had two horses shot out from under him , and four bullets pierced his coat . He sustained no injuries and showed coolness under fire . Braddock , who had been loaded onto a wagon in a makeshift litter , ordered Washington to ride back to fetch the remainder of the army that was working its way up from the Great Meadows . The battered remnants of Braddock 's force eventually returned to Fort Cumberland , where Washington wrote letters harshly critical of the event . To Governor Dinwiddie he reported that , although the British officers fought well , their " cowardly Dogs of soldiers " did not . The Virginians , he said , acquitted themselves well : they " behaved like Men , and died like Soldiers . " His reports burnished the reputation of the Virginia Regiment , and Washington was lauded as the " hero of Monongahela " for his work organizing the retreat . Dinwiddie was also forced to acknowledge Washington 's " gallant <unk> [ io ] r " , and the Virginia House of Burgesses reorganized the colony 's defenses with Washington as colonel of a 1 @,@ 200 strong regiment . 
 = = Command , rank , and defense = = 
 Governor Dinwiddie had designated Fort Cumberland the regimental headquarters , even though it was located in Maryland . Washington learned that it was commanded by Captain John Dagworthy , who led a company of Maryland militia but also held a royal commission and would thus outrank him . After a brief visit to Fort Cumberland in September 1755 , Washington left , and chose to base himself at Winchester instead . He then embarked on recruiting expeditions to fill out the regiment , traveling often to Williamsburg . There , he complained bitterly to Dinwiddie about serving under Dagworthy . When Dagworthy refused to let the Virginians draw supplies from Fort Cumberland ( which , despite its location , had been paid for and provisioned by Virginia ) , Dinwiddie came to agree with Washington . He wrote to Massachusetts Governor William Shirley , who was acting as commander in chief after Braddock 's death , requesting royal commissions for Washington and other Virginia officers . When Shirley did not respond in a timely manner , Dinwiddie authorized Washington to travel to Boston to renew the request in person . Washington spent some time visiting in all of the major towns on the way , but his mission was ultimately only partially successful . After receiving Washington , Shirley issued a decree that Virginia 's officers outranked Dagworthy and other British officers of lower rank . 
 In his first year in command of the Virginia Regiment , Washington shaped the unit into one of the best provincial military units in the colonies . He rigorously enforced military discipline , often punishing transgressions with the lash , but also sometimes hanging those convicted of serious offenses like desertion . The latter was a particular problem : many of the recruits were either foreigners or from Virginia 's lower classes , and had little at stake in the conflict . He developed detailed guidelines for frontier warfare , was personally responsible for organizing the supply and equipment of the regiment , and even designed the regimental uniforms . He was also a voracious reader of military treatises of all sorts , from Julius Caesar 's Commentaries to recent British training manuals . Despite all of his work , Virginia 's frontier was ravaged by raiding parties , and he lost one third of his men in eighteen months . Washington 's relationship with Dinwiddie deteriorated again over these difficulties and ongoing complaints about pay that was inadequate compared to British regimental standards . 
 In 1757 Washington renewed attempts to cultivate relations in the army in the hopes of getting a commission . He wrote flattering letters to the new commander in chief , the Earl of Loudoun , and even named one of Virginia 's frontier forts after him . However , Loudoun was only in command for one year , and was recalled after a failed expedition against Fortress Louisbourg . Later in the year , Washington again suffered a serious bout of dysentery ; he was bedridden for much of the winter of 1757 – 58 , and even suggested to the Virginia Burgesses that he be replaced since he could not properly do his duty as colonel of the regiment .

 The failures of British military policy in 1757 led to a change of government in London , with William Pitt coming firmly into control of Britain 's global war effort . Pitt decided to focus a large number of resources on the war in North America , and three major expeditions were planned . One of these , under the command of Brigadier General John Forbes , was assigned to move against the French in the Ohio Country , with its first major goal the capture of Fort Duquesne .

 The Virginia Burgesses voted to raise a second regiment of 1 @,@ 000 men in addition to Washington 's , both of which would participate in the Forbes expedition under Washington 's overall command . Forbes was apparently already aware of Washington 's reputation , writing that he was " a good and knowing Officer in the Back Country . " Washington , as he had with other army commanders , hoped for notice and sponsorship , and asked General John Stanwix to " [ m ] <unk> me in favorable terms to General Forbes . " Forbes ordered the Virginia troops to gather at Winchester while the army began cutting a new road from Carlisle , Pennsylvania toward Fort Duquesne . Based in part on advice from Washington , Forbes spent much of the spring and summer negotiating with the Ohio Indians for their support . A preliminary agreement was reached in August in which many of those Indians , led by chief <unk> , agreed to abandon their alliance with the French . Washington and his troops were first given the task of improving the road between Fort Frederick and Fort Cumberland , and did not join with the main army at Fort Bedford until late summer . 
 At this point Forbes was faced with a choice of routes . He could cut a new road directly across western Pennsylvania , or he could go south and pick up Braddock 's route . Washington extensively lobbied Forbes and other British officers to use Braddock 's route , which would have been more advantageous to Virginia interests . Forbes and others took a dim view of this activity , suspecting personal and provincial financial motivation . In response to a letter in which Washington bemoaned " our <unk> [ is ] <unk> " , and blamed Colonel Henry Bouquet for his advocacy of the Pennsylvania route , Forbes angrily wrote , " I am now at the bottom , of their Scheme against this new road " and <unk> Washington , writing that his heavy @-@ handed advocacy " was a shame for any officer to be Concerned in . " Forbes ultimately chose the Pennsylvania route for pragmatic military reasons : the army , was expected to occupy and hold Fort Duquesne , and would require a reliable supply route , and the Pennsylvania route was superior for this purpose . However , as the expedition pushed west and Forbes learned that the last ridge to cross would prove particularly difficult , he granted that Washington and other advocates of the Virginia route may have been correct in their assessment of the chosen route 's problems . 
 = = = Advance on Fort Duquesne = = = 
 In early September , troops under Henry Bouquet 's command began construction of a fort near present @-@ day Loyalhanna Township that eventually came to be known as Fort Ligonier . Bouquet was handling the forward activities of the expedition because Forbes was sick with dysentery . On September 11 , Bouquet authorized Major James Grant to lead a reconnaissance in force to investigate the strength of Fort Duquesne 's defenses . Grant took this opportunity to launch an assault on the fort , and was decisively beaten and taken prisoner along with one third of his 800 @-@ strong detachment . Although Washington was not involved , men from his regiment acquitted themselves well in the debacle ; 62 of them died in the battle , and others were among the prisoners . The French at Fort Duquesne , whose supply line had been cut by the British victory in the August Battle of Fort Frontenac , made an unsuccessful attack against Fort Ligonier in the hopes of either stopping the expedition or at least acquiring some of its supplies . 
 On November 12 , in response to rumors that the French had sent out a raiding force , Forbes sent out a detachment of the Virginia regiment to investigate reports of a French raiding expedition . When sounds of gunfire reached the British camp , Forbes sent a second detachment . Primary sources are unclear on which detachment Washington led ; the other was led by Lieutenant Colonel George Mercer . In the dimming light of early evening and the haze of musket smoke the two detachments mistook each other for the enemy ; the friendly fire incident resulted in 40 casualties . Washington claimed to have interceded , " knocking up with his sword the presented pieces " , but Captain Thomas Bullitt , the only other officer to leave an account , held Washington responsible for the incident , noting that his opinion was shared by " several of the officers . " The incident appeared to leave an emotional scar on Washington , who did not speak or write of it for many years . 
 A beneficial result of the incident was that several prisoners were taken ; Forbes learned from them that Fort Duquesne was about to be abandoned . This prompted Forbes to accelerate the expedition 's advance , and it was soon in a position of strength about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Fort Duquesne . On November 23 they heard a large explosion from the direction of the fort ; its commander , François @-@ Marie Le Marchand de <unk> , had blown it up . Forbes assigned Washington command of one of the brigades that advanced to find the smoking remains of the French fort the next day . General Forbes , still weak from illness , only briefly visited the site . He completed the return trip to Philadelphia in a litter , and died in March 1759 . Washington was back home in Virginia by the end of December ; the expedition was his last military activity of the war . 
 = = End of service = = 
 Upon his return to Williamsburg , Washington , to the surprise of many , tendered his resignation from the Virginia militia . Many of his officers showered him with praise , including the critical Captain Thomas Bullitt . Washington was lauded for his " punctual <unk> " of his duties , the " <unk> , Sincerity , and a certain Openness of Soul " , and the " mutual Regard that has always subsisted between you and your Officers . " Biographer James Ferling characterizes as their highest tribute the statements that Washington " heightened our natural Emulation , and our Desire to excel " and " In you we place the most implicit confidence . " 
 = = Lessons learned = = 
 Although Washington never gained the commission in the British army he yearned for , in these years the young man gained valuable military , political , and leadership skills , and received significant public exposure in the colonies and abroad . He closely observed British military tactics , gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution . He demonstrated his toughness and courage in the most difficult situations , including disasters and retreats . He developed a command presence — given his size , strength , stamina , and bravery in battle , he appeared to soldiers to be a natural leader and they followed him without question . Washington gained connections because of his popularity , which would serve him well later in the Revolution . His involvement in the war , given the circumstances , was just enough for him to be able to craft his own idea of what a leader looked like . Washington learned to organize , train , and drill , and discipline his companies and regiments . From his observations , readings and conversations with professional officers , he learned the basics of battlefield tactics , as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics . Historian Ron Chernow is of the opinion that his frustrations in dealing with government officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency that could get results ; other historians tend to ascribe Washington 's position on government to his later American Revolutionary War service . His dealings also gave him the diplomatic skills necessary to negotiate with officials at the local and provincial levels . He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia , who seemed too unreliable , too undisciplined , and too short @-@ term compared to regulars . On the other hand , his experience was limited to command of about 1 @,@ 000 men , and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations he faced during the revolution at Boston , New York , Trenton and Philadelphia . 
 = = Later life = = 
 On January 6 , 1759 , Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis , a wealthy Virginia widow . He had already won election to the Virginia House of Burgesses during the summer of 1758 . For the next 16 years he lived the life of a Virginia plantation owner and politician . As tensions rose between the British parliament and the colonies , he gradually adopted positions in opposition to the parliament 's policies . When the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775 , Washington arrived at the Second Continental Congress in a military uniform , and was chosen as Commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Continental Army . After leading American forces to victory , he chaired the Constitutional Convention that drafted the United States Constitution , and was then elected the first President of the United States , serving two terms . He briefly saw additional military service during a threatened war with France in 1798 , and died in December 1799 . He is widely recognized as the " Father of his country " .

 = Miss Calypso = 
 Miss Calypso is a 1957 album by writer and poet Maya Angelou . The album was released during a craze for calypso music catalyzed by Harry Belafonte the previous year . Angelou sings every song on the album , and she composed five of them . Behind Angelou 's voice , studio guitarist Tommy Tedesco and percussionist Al Bello created an exotic mood . Angelou toured in support of the album , performing calypso songs in nightclubs . The album was a modest success but Angelou did not make any further records as a singer . 
 Angelou later gained fame as an author and a poet , most notably her first autobiography , I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings . In her fourth autobiography , The Heart of a Woman , she downplays her singing career and assigns little importance to Miss Calypso . In 1995 , the album was re @-@ released as a CD during a period of customer interest in 1950s exotica . Its artistry was re @-@ examined in light of Angelou 's later fame ; it was said to exemplify the calypso music of the period , spiced with a feeling for the tradition 's roots . 
 = = Background = = 
 Maya Angelou had modest success as a singer , dancer , and performer beginning in 1954 , when her marriage to her first husband , Tosh Angelos , ended . She performed in clubs around San Francisco , including the Purple Onion , where she sang and danced calypso music . Up to that point she went by her birth name Marguerite Johnson , or by the name Rita , but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters , she changed her professional name to " Maya Angelou " , a " distinctive name " that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances . 
 During 1954 and 1955 Angelou toured 22 countries , mostly in Europe , with a production of the opera Porgy and Bess , which she describes in her third autobiography , Singin ' and Swingin ' and Gettin ' Merry Like Christmas ( 1976 ) . By February 1956 she was touring with her own new show , an exotic calypso act which played at the Keyboard in Beverly Hills , where she was " wooed by disk executives " , according to Billboard . She headlined at the Village Vanguard in March , gigged for four weeks at the Clouds in Honolulu in July – August , and joined the Lester Horton dancers for a Halloween show at the Palladium . Angelou signed with Liberty Records in September . By November 1956 , Variety was describing the process of recording her first album , Miss Calypso , and even speculating that her second album might be a collection of Noël Coward songs , based on her playful ad @-@ libbing of a Coward tune between takes at the recording studio . 
 In 1957 Angelou appeared in an off @-@ Broadway revue that inspired her first film , Calypso Heat Wave , in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions . Also in 1957 , the album Miss Calypso was completed and released ; it was reissued as a CD in 1995 . According to reviewer Hilton Als , Angelou sang and performed calypso because she " had followed the fashion of the time " , and not to develop as an artist . Als states about Miss Calypso : " But it was clear that the album itself was not the point . Developing her artistry was not the point . Fame , not art , was her spur ... " In 1958 , Angelou met blues singer Billie Holiday , who after walking out during one of Angelou 's calypso performances , told her , " You 're going to be famous . But it won 't be for singing " . 
 As she described in her fourth autobiography The Heart of a Woman , Angelou eventually gave up performing for a writing career , and became a poet and writer . According to Chuck Foster , who wrote the liner notes in the album 's 1995 reissue , her calypso music career is " given short shrift " and dismissed in the book . Her first autobiography , I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings ( 1969 ) , brought her international recognition and acclaim . 
 = = Artwork = = 
 Richie Unterberger of <unk> described the album 's cover as featuring Angelou " draped in a slip of a red dress , gyrating next to a fire in the middle of a ( almost definitely fake ) jungle " . After finding it in a used record bin in 1994 , Chuck Foster featured the cover in his column in Beat Magazine . Foster considered the cover as one of the best examples of the calypso era . He described the cover art in this way : " A barely draped young Maya gyrates around a bonfire from which the flaming title emerges " . 
 = = Reviews = = 
 Miss Calypso was a modest success . Billboard Magazine 's review said about the album , " [ Although ] calypso addicts will question the authenticity of this package , Miss Angelou has enough sell in her voice to offer dealers a promising set . Selections include such oldies as " Run Joe " , " Stone Cold Dead in the Market " , and " Calypso Blues " , all of which are handled with finesse . Singer 's name value is a rising commodity via her <unk> dates , and should increase some as a result of this wax " . 
 Unterberger wrote that the 1995 reissue of the album was " probably motivated by the exotica @-@ space age pop revival " . He called the album 's music " more or less straight @-@ ahead pop @-@ calypso " that was " not that strange or cheesy " . He complimented Angelou 's performance , saying that she " sung with respectable <unk> " , and compared the album to Harry Belafonte 's calypso recordings of the same era . 
 Variety reviewed one of Angelou 's live calypso performances , a gig in Chicago at Mr. Kelly 's nightclub during much of December 1956 . Hal Spector quoted the review in the album 's 1957 liner notes . Stef , the Variety reviewer , called Angelou 's act " sizzling " and a " unique creation in the jazz world when everything progressive is expected to be on the cool side " . He called the song " <unk> Bongo " " recitative " and complimented its conversational nature with the drums . He commented on the intimacy and sharpness in Angelou 's performance of " The Heat is On " , a song she wrote but one that does not appear on the album . He called " Calypso Blues " , written by Nat King Cole and Don George , " an artfully simple welding of idioms " and another song she composed , " Scandal in the Family " , " standard Trinidad calypso stuff " and reported that her performance of it " rocked the house " . 
 Spector , also in the album 's 1957 liner notes , reported on another of Angelou 's concerts in the Beverly Hills nightclub The Keyboard , when she performed many of the songs on Miss Calypso . He called her a polite , soft @-@ spoken , calm , and poised young woman " that completely mystified the audience " . He found that Angelou 's performance made an indelible impression and that she had an unusual voice and striking appearance . Spector stated , " She had captured the audience swiftly and effectively with her calm and affectionate manner " , and promised that she would do the same for listeners of the album . He also predicted that she was " destined to become a very big name in show business " . Spector characterized Angelou 's music as " calypso style with a liberal sprinkling of Afro @-@ Cuban , and a dash of blues mixed together with delicate jazz " . 
 Foster , in the album 's liner notes its 1995 reissue , called the music " fresh as the day it was recorded and entirely captivating " , but that it followed the tradition of the calypso of its era . He described the album 's genre as having " Jazz , Afro @-@ Cuban rhythms , Odetta @-@ style folk " , with " gospel and blues voicings and Belafonte @-@ influenced Caribbean flavors " . Foster considered Tommy Tedesco 's guitar and Al Bello 's percussion as having a " Beat @-@ era spiritual sound " . He thought that Angelou brought out the best in the calypso standards " Peas and Rice " and " Run Joe " , but that she reached her peak with " Scandal in the Family " , all of which he found as authentic as the songs she wrote . He stated that two of the songs Angelou wrote , " Mambo in Africa " and " Neighbor , Neighbor " , effectively combined her skills as a poet and composer . He compared her music with other calypso artists of the same era , but considered hers more " uptown " and more like the music of modern artists such as Tracy Chapman . Foster also compared Angelou 's music in Miss Calypso with her later writing , and called both " hot and spicy , peppered with a roots flavoring " . Jessica Letkemann of Billboard Magazine stated that Angelou 's tuneful and distinctive voice would " serve her so well in later years as a spoken word artist " .

 = Mormon Trail = 
 The Mormon Trail or Mormon Pioneer Trail is the 1 @,@ 300 @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 092 km ) route that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints traveled from 1846 to 1868 . Today , the Mormon Trail is a part of the United States National Trails System , known as the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail . 
 The Mormon Trail extends from Nauvoo , Illinois , which was the principal settlement of the Latter Day Saints from 1839 to 1846 , to Salt Lake City , Utah , which was settled by Brigham Young and his followers beginning in 1847 . From Council Bluffs , Iowa to Fort Bridger in Wyoming , the trail follows much the same route as the Oregon Trail and the California Trail ; these trails are collectively known as the Emigrant Trail . 
 The Mormon pioneer run began in 1846 , when Young and his followers were driven from Nauvoo . After leaving , they aimed to establish a new home for the church in the Great Basin and crossed Iowa . Along their way , some were assigned to establish settlements and to plant and harvest crops for later emigrants . During the winter of 1846 – 47 , the emigrants wintered in Iowa , other nearby states , and the unorganized territory that later became Nebraska , with the largest group residing in Winter Quarters , Nebraska . In the spring of 1847 , Young led the vanguard company to the Salt Lake Valley , which was then outside the boundaries of the United States and later became Utah . 
 During the first few years , the emigrants were mostly former occupants of Nauvoo who were following Young to Utah . Later , the emigrants increasingly comprised converts from the British Isles and Europe . 
 The trail was used for more than 20 years , until the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 . Among the emigrants were the Mormon handcart pioneers of 1856 – 60 . Two of the handcart companies , led by James G. Willie and Edward Martin , met disaster on the trail when they departed late and were caught by heavy snowstorms in Wyoming . 
 = = Background = = 
 Under the leadership of Joseph Smith , Latter Day Saints established several communities throughout the United States between 1830 and 1844 , most notably in Kirtland , Ohio ; Independence , Missouri ; and Nauvoo . However , the Saints were driven out of each of them in turn , ( lacking citation , or source ) due to conflicts with other settlers ( see History of the Latter Day Saint movement ) . This included the actions of Governor Lilburn Boggs , who issued Missouri Executive Order 44 , which called for the " extermination " of all Mormons in Missouri . The Latter @-@ day Saints were finally forced to abandon Nauvoo in 1846 . 
 Although the movement had split into several denominations after Smith 's death in 1844 , most members aligned themselves with Brigham Young and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints ( LDS ) . Under Young 's leadership , about 14 @,@ 000 Mormon citizens of Nauvoo set out to find a new home in the West . 
 = = The Trek West = = 
 As the senior apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles after Joseph Smith 's death , Brigham Young assumed responsibility of the leadership of the church . He would later be sustained as President of the Church and prophet . 
 Young now had to lead the Saints into the far west , without knowing exactly where to go or where they would end up . He insisted the Mormons should settle in a place no one else wanted and felt the isolated Great Basin would provide the Saints with many advantages . 
 Young reviewed information on the Great Salt Lake Valley and the Great Basin , consulted with mountain men and trappers , and met with Father Pierre @-@ Jean De Smet , a Jesuit missionary familiar with the region . Young also organized a vanguard company to break trail to the Rocky Mountains , evaluate trail conditions , find sources of water , and select a central gathering point in the Great Basin . A new route on the north side of the Platte and North Platte rivers was chosen to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights , water access , and campsites with travelers using the established Oregon Trail on the river ’ s south side . 
 The Quincy Convention of October 1845 passed resolutions demanding that the Latter @-@ day Saints withdraw from Nauvoo by May 1846 . A few days later , the Carthage Convention called for establishment of a militia that would force them out if they failed to meet the May deadline . To try to meet this deadline and to get an early start on the trek to the Great Basin , the Latter @-@ day Saints began leaving Nauvoo in February 1846 . 
 = = = Trek of 1846 = = = 
 The departure from Nauvoo began on February 4 , 1846 , under the leadership of Brigham Young . This early departure exposed them to the elements in the worst of winter . After crossing the Mississippi River , the journey across Iowa Territory followed primitive territorial roads and Native American trails . 
 Young originally planned to lead an express company of about 300 men to the Great Basin during the summer of 1846 . He believed they could cross Iowa and reach the Missouri River in four to six weeks . However , the actual trip across Iowa was slowed by rain , mud , swollen rivers , and poor preparation , and it required 16 weeks – nearly three times longer than planned . 
 Heavy rains turned the rolling plains of southern Iowa into a quagmire of axle @-@ deep mud . Furthermore , few people carried adequate provisions for the trip . The weather , general unpreparedness , and lack of experience in moving such a large group of people all contributed to the difficulties they endured . 
 The initial party reached the Missouri River on June 14 . It was apparent that the Latter @-@ day Saints could not make it to the Great Basin that season and would have to winter on the Missouri River .. 
 Some of the emigrants established a settlement called Kanesville on the Iowa side of the river . Others moved across the river into the area of present @-@ day Omaha , Nebraska , and built a camp called Winter Quarters .

 In April 1847 , chosen members of the vanguard company gathered , final supplies were packed , and the group was organized into 14 military companies . A militia and night guard were formed . The company consisted of 143 men , including three blacks and eight members of the Quorum of the Twelve , three women , and two children . The train contained 73 wagons , draft animals , and livestock , and carried enough supplies to provision the group for one year . On April 5 , the wagon train moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin . 
 The journey from Winter Quarters to Fort Laramie took six weeks ; the company arrived at the fort on June 1 . While at Fort Laramie , the vanguard company was joined by members of the Mormon Battalion , who had been excused due to illness and sent to winter in Pueblo , Colorado , and a group of Church members from Mississippi . At this point , the now larger company took the established Oregon Trail toward the trading post at Fort Bridger . 
 Young met mountain man Jim Bridger on June 28 . They discussed routes into the Salt Lake Valley and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin . The company pushed on through South Pass , rafted across the Green River , and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7 . About the same time , they were joined by 12 more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion . 
 Now facing a more rugged and hazardous trek , Young chose to follow the trail used by the Donner – Reed party on their journey to California the previous year . As the vanguard company traveled through the rugged mountains , they divided into three sections . Young and several other members of the party suffered from a fever , generally accepted as a “ mountain fever ” induced by wood ticks . The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group , and a scouting division was created to move farther ahead on the designated route . 
 Scouts Erastus Snow and Orson Pratt entered the Salt Lake Valley on July 21 . On July 23 , Pratt offered a prayer dedicating the land to the Lord . Ground was broken , irrigation ditches were dug , and the first fields of potatoes and turnips were planted . On July 24 , Young first saw the valley from a “ sick ” wagon driven by his friend Wilford Woodruff . According to Woodruff , Young expressed his satisfaction in the appearance of the valley and declared , " This is the right place , drive on . " 
 In August 1847 , Young and selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters to organize the companies scheduled for following years . By December 1847 , more than 2 @,@ 000 Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley , then in Mexican territory . 
 Farming the uncultivated land was initially difficult , as the shares broke when they tried to plow the dry ground . Therefore , an irrigation system was designed and the land was flooded before plowing , and the resulting system provided supplemental moisture during the year . 
 Salt Lake City was laid out and designated as Church headquarters . Hard work produced a prosperous community . In their new settlement , entertainment was also important , and the first public building was a theater . 
 It did not take long , however , until the United States caught up with them , and in 1848 , after the end of the war with Mexico , the land in which they settled became part of the United States .
