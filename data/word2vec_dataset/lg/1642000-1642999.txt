 = Edwin Thumboo = 
 Edwin <unk> Thumboo <unk> ( born 22 November 1933 ) is a Singaporean poet and academic who is regarded as one of the pioneers of English literature in Singapore . 
 Thumboo graduated in English from the University of Malaya in 1956 . Although he applied for a position at the university , he was rejected as few locals held academic posts at that time . He therefore worked in the civil service for about nine years before finally joining the university , then renamed the University of Singapore , in 1966 following Singapore 's independence . He received a Ph.D. from the university in 1970 . Thumboo rose to the position of full professor in the Department of English Language and Literature , heading the department between 1977 and 1993 . After the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University in 1980 to form the National University of Singapore ( NUS ) , he was the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences from 1980 to 1991 , NUS 's longest @-@ serving dean . Thumboo was the first Chairman and Director of the university 's Centre for the Arts from 1993 to 2005 , and continues to be associated with the university as an emeritus professor , a position he has held since retiring from full @-@ time teaching in September 1997 . 
 Thumboo 's poetry is inspired by myth and history , and he is often dubbed Singapore 's unofficial poet laureate because of his poems with nationalistic themes . A pioneer of local English literature , he compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry and fiction from Singapore and Malaysia . His own collections of poetry include Rib of Earth ( 1956 ) , Ulysses by the Merlion ( 1979 ) and A Third Map ( 1993 ) . His latest anthology Still Travelling , consisting of almost 50 poems , was published in 2008 . Thumboo has won the National Book Development Council of Singapore Book Awards for Poetry three times , in 1978 , 1980 and 1994 . He has also received the inaugural S.E.A. Write Award ( 1979 ) , the first Cultural Medallion for Literature ( 1979 ) , the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) Cultural and Communication Award ( Literature ) ( 1987 ) , and the Raja Rao Award ( 2002 ) . He was conferred a Bintang Bakti Masyarakat ( Public Service Star ) in 1981 with an additional Bar in 1991 , and the Pingat Jasa Gemilang ( Meritorious Services Medal ) in 2006 . He conceived the first National Poetry Festival for Singapore in 2015 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Edwin Thumboo , born in Singapore on 22 November 1933 , was the eldest of eight children of a Tamil schoolteacher and a Teochew Chinese @-@ Peranakan housewife from a Singaporean merchant family . He and his siblings grew up speaking English and Teochew . The family was financially comfortable ; their home in <unk> was the only one in the neighbourhood with electricity . Because of his mixed parentage , as a child he was sometimes called names and marginalized . This was said to have fostered determination and self @-@ respect in him . He completed his primary education at Pasir Panjang Primary School in 1940 . During the Japanese occupation of Singapore ( 1942 – 1945 ) , he helped his family by selling cakes , tending goats , and working as a <unk> . Following the war , he studied at Monk 's Hill Secondary School ( finishing there in 1946 ) and Victoria School ( 1948 ) . It was at the latter place that he began writing poetry at the age of 17 years , encouraged by the senior English master Shamus Frazer . Thumboo considers Frazer his spiritual father , and later dedicated Rib of Earth ( 1956 ) , his first collection of poetry published while an undergraduate , to him . At this time , Thumboo was also a member of the Youth Poetry Circle , which counted among its members other early literary pioneers of Singapore such as Goh Sin Tub and Lim Thean Soo . 
 = = Education and career = = 
 Thumboo majored in English literature and history at the University of Malaya . As a freshman , he was a member of the editorial board of Fajar ( Dawn in Malay ) , a radical leftist journal published by the University Socialist Club . The seventh issue of Fajar which appeared in May 1954 contained an editorial entitled " Aggression in Asia " which advocated independence from the United Kingdom . Three days later , Chinese middle school students clashed with the police . As a result , after two weeks Thumboo was arrested by the British colonial government together with seven other students and put on trial for sedition . Minister Mentor and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew , who was the Club 's legal adviser and a Fajar subscriber , arranged for British Queen 's Counsel D. N. Pritt to act in their defence , with Lee himself as junior counsel . The students were acquitted of the charge by District Judge F. A. Chua . 
 Thumboo graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with honours ( B.A. ( Hons . ) ) in English in 1956 . Hoping to teach and pursue a further degree , he applied for a position at the university but was rejected as few locals held academic posts at that time . He therefore entered the civil service , working for the Income Tax Department ( 1957 – 1961 ) , Central Provident Fund Board ( 1961 – 1965 ) , and the Singapore Telephone Board ( 1965 – 1966 ) where he was an assistant secretary . In 1966 , the year following Singapore 's independence , he joined the University of Singapore as an assistant lecturer . Conducting doctoral research into African poetry in English , he received his Ph.D. from the university in 1970 . He became a full professor in the Department of English Language and Literature , heading the department between 1977 and 1993 . The University of Singapore and Nanyang University merged in 1980 to form the National University of Singapore ( NUS ) , and he was the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences from 1980 to 1991 , NUS 's longest @-@ serving dean . 
 As an academic , he taught Elizabethan and Jacobean drama , the Romantic poets , Malaysian and Singaporean literatures , and creative writing , among other subjects . His research interests included the modern novel ( E. M. Forster , D. H. Lawrence and Joseph Conrad ) and the novels of Empire ( such as Rudyard Kipling ) , Commonwealth literature ( including Botswana writer Bessie Head ) , and William Shakespeare 's Roman plays . When he headed the English Department , it introduced the study of Commonwealth / New Literatures in English , and of English language as a major so that graduates would be better equipped to teach English in schools and junior colleges . Thumboo was appointed a Professorial Fellow by NUS in 1995 and continues to be associated with the university as an emeritus professor , a position he has held since he retired from full @-@ time teaching in September 1997 . He served as the first Chairman and Director of the university 's Centre for the Arts from 1993 to 2005 . 
 Thumboo also held visiting professorships and fellowships at universities in Australia , the UK and the US . He was Fulbright @-@ Hayes Visiting Professor at Pennsylvania State University ( 1979 – 1980 ) ; Chairman of the Association for Commonwealth Literature and Language Studies , VII Triennium ( 1983 – 1986 ) ; Writer @-@ in @-@ Residence at the Institute of Culture and Communication , Hawaii ( 1985 ) ; Ida Beam Professor at the University of Iowa in 1986 ; a member of the International Advisory Panel at the East @-@ West Centre , Hawaii ( 1987 ) ; Honorary Research Fellow at University College , University of London ( 1987 ) ; a member of the Committee of Jurors for the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in Oklahoma , USA ( 1988 ) ; CAS – Miller Visiting Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana @-@ Champaign ( 1998 ) , Visiting Professor and Writer @-@ in @-@ Residence at University of Wollongong in New South Wales ( 1989 ) ; and Visiting Fellow at the Department of English , Australian Defence Force Academy ( 1993 ) . In 1991 , Thumboo worked with the Ministry of Education to help establish the Creative Arts Programme for secondary school and junior college students in Singapore . He continues to mentor young poets under the programme . 
 = = Poetry and influence = = 
 In the 1950s , Thumboo wrote mostly lyrical poetry based on personal experiences . Displaying the influence of the English literary tradition on him , they dealt with aesthetic and metaphysical themes . By the mid @-@ 1970s , he had shifted his focus to the public sphere , believing that poets of post @-@ independence Singapore should work towards creating a national literature . Singapore 's national life was a key subject of his collection of poetry Gods Can Die ( 1977 ) , and it has been said that the subsequent anthologies Ulysses by the Merlion ( 1979 ) and A Third Map ( 1993 ) " established his reputation as a national poet committed to articulating a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore " . Thumboo is often dubbed Singapore 's unofficial poet laureate because of his poems with nationalistic themes , notably 9 August – II ( 1977 ) , and Ulysses by the Merlion ( 1979 ) which was published in the anthology of the same name , as well as his role in promoting Singapore literature , for example , through his work as General Editor of the literary journal Singa . Ulysses , which references an iconic statue of a beast with the upper body of a lion and the tail of a fish called the Merlion that faces Marina Bay , was inspired by the use of Irish mythology and history by W. B. Yeats . The Irish poet has asserted a significant influence on Thumboo , as Thumboo recognizes parallels between Ireland 's nationalistic struggle and Singapore 's breakaway from colonialism . He describes himself as a myth @-@ inspired poet , and sees myths as ancient narratives and structures which provide a stable point of reference for a multicultural society . Ulysses has prompted other Singaporean poets such as <unk> Sa 'at , Vernon Chan , David Leo , Felix Cheong , Gwee Li Sui , Koh Buck Song , Lee Tzu <unk> , Alvin Pang and Daren Shiau to write their own Merlion @-@ themed verses ; it is often joked that one cannot be regarded as a true Singapore poet until one has written a " Merlion poem " . A copy of Ulysses is installed on a plaque near the statue . 
 History also features strongly in Thumboo 's poetry . He has said : 
 ... History enters my writing , as it ought to enter the writing of others , because of its importance in our lives . I go back to this point about the historical moments we occupy . As a former colony , a multi @-@ racial one , created by the British , we need history for a sense of things ; to re @-@ inscribe ourselves ; discover and , in certain areas , define ourselves as individuals , as groups in a multi @-@ racial society . They give you a sense of their belonging , which also happens to be mine . They give you an inherited identity that you put together by being conscious of what you have absorbed , or taken . I live in Singapore ; I have likes and dislikes , a set of interests , a set of values , a set of responsibilities and so on . History I see as fully inclusive , fully in terms of one 's personal limits . And it includes beliefs , and anything of significance ... nothing is irrelevant . 
 In August 2008 , The Straits Times said that Thumboo 's " most powerful legacy " was " spearheading the creation of a Singapore literature in English " , although Thumboo himself downplayed his pioneering role by commenting : " There were not that many people writing in 1965 , so you had the feeling that you had to create something . But you don 't stand there and say , ' Look , I am a pioneer ' . There is a need to do something , to help go about creating something , and you do it . " He compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry from Singapore and Malaysia , including The Flowering Tree ( 1970 ) , Seven Poets ( 1973 ) and The Second Tongue ( 1979 ) . He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) Committee of Culture and Information entitled The Poetry of Singapore ( 1985 ) and The Fiction of Singapore ( 1990 ) . In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned , he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child 's Delight ( 1972 ) , and another collection called Friend : Poems ( 2003 ) . Still Travelling , an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems , was published in 2008 . 
 On 29 October 2001 , at the launch of a book entitled <unk> : Departures and Returns – Essays for Edwin Thumboo at the Singapore Art Museum , Associate Professor Robbie Goh said : 
 ... Edwin Thumboo ’ s dual discourses – the analytical and theoretical discourse of the scholar , and the emotive and associative discourse of the poet – enable him to capture the flow of our experience , and to present it in a variety of different ways , accessible to a variety of individuals . ... 
 I 've come to see that Edwin Thumboo writes incessantly , because he is driven to communicate something of a better world ; he rolls his sleeves up to act , because he is impatient with waiting for this world to change ; and he forges friendships , because these represent the hope for a better world even within this imperfect one . His impact cannot be measured by words alone , but words – the tools of his own trade – may capture the " covenant " of his ideas and values . 
 In 2015 , Gods Can Die was selected by The Business Times as one of the Top 10 English Singapore books from 1965 – 2015 , alongside titles by Goh Poh Seng , Daren Shiau and Amanda Lee Koe .

He also received the inaugural S.E.A. Write Award in 1979 , the first Cultural Medallion for Literature in 1979 , and the ASEAN Cultural and Communication Award ( Literature ) in 1987 . In October 2002 , he presented the keynote address at the biennial meeting of the International Association of World Englishes at the University of Illinois at Urbana @-@ Champaign . There , he was presented with the Raja Rao Award for his contributions to the literature of the Indian diaspora .

 = Russell T Davies = 
 Stephen Russell Davies , OBE ( born 27 April 1963 ) , better known by his pen name Russell T Davies , is a Welsh television producer and screenwriter whose works include Queer as Folk , Bob & Rose , The Second Coming , Casanova , the 2005 revival of the classic British science fiction series Doctor Who , and the trilogy Cucumber , Tofu , and Banana . 
 Born in Swansea , Davies aspired to work as a comic artist in his adult life , until a careers advisor at Olchfa School suggested that he study English literature ; he consequently focused on a career of <unk> and screen @-@ writing . After he graduated from Oxford University , Davies joined the BBC 's children 's department in 1985 on a part @-@ time basis and worked in varying positions , including writing and producing two series , Dark Season and Century Falls . He left the BBC in the early 1990s to work for Granada Television and later became a freelance writer . 
 Davies moved into writing adult television dramas in 1994 . His early scripts generally explored concepts of religion and sexuality among various backdrops : Revelations was a soap opera about organised religion and featured a lesbian vicar ; Springhill was a soap drama about a Catholic family in contemporary Liverpool ; The Grand explored society 's opinion of subjects such as prostitution , abortion and homosexuality during the interwar period ; and Queer as Folk , his first prolific series , recreated his experiences in the Manchester gay scene . His later series include Bob & Rose , which portrayed a gay man who fell in love with a woman ; The Second Coming , which focused on the second coming and <unk> of Jesus Christ from a mostly non @-@ religious point of view ; Mine All Mine , a comedy about a family who discover they own the entire city of Swansea ; and Casanova , an adaptation of the Venetian lover 's complete memoirs . 
 He revived and ran Doctor Who after a sixteen @-@ year hiatus , with Christopher Eccleston , and later David Tennant , in the title role . Davies 's tenure as executive producer of the show oversaw a surge in popularity that led to the production of two spin @-@ off series , Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures , and the revival of the Saturday prime @-@ time dramas as a profitable venture for production companies . Davies was appointed an OBE in 2008 for services to drama , which coincided with his announcement that he would step down from Doctor Who as the show 's executive producer with his final script , The End of Time ( 2009 – 10 ) . Davies moved to Los Angeles , California in 2009 , where he oversaw production of Torchwood : Miracle Day and the fifth and final series of The Sarah Jane Adventures . 
 After his partner developed cancer in late 2011 , Davies returned to the UK , and co @-@ created a new drama for CBBC , Wizards vs Aliens . His current projects are Cucumber , a Channel 4 series about middle @-@ aged gay men in the Manchester gay scene ; Banana , an E4 series about young LGBT people in the Cucumber universe ; and Tofu , an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing issues which have arisen in the sister series , modern sex and sexuality with the cast and public . 
 = = Early life and youth career = = 
 Stephen Russell Davies was born on 27 April 1963 in Mount Pleasant Hospital , Swansea , Glamorgan . His father , Vivian Davies ( died 2015 ) , and his mother , Barbara ( died 1999 ) , were teachers . Davies was the youngest of three children and their only son . Because he was born by <unk> section , his mother was placed on a morphine drip and was institutionalised after an overdose resulted in a psychotic episode . He described his mother 's experience as " literally ... like science fiction " and an early inspiration for his writing career . 
 As a child , Davies was almost always referred to by his middle name . He grew up in a household that " never switched the TV off " until after <unk> , and he subsequently became immersed in dramas such as I , Claudius and Doctor Who ; one of his first memories , at the age of three , was the dénouement of the 1966 Doctor Who serial The Tenth Planet . He was also an avid cartoonist and comics enthusiast and purchased series such as Asterix and Peanuts . 
 Davies attended the local <unk> Primary School in <unk> and enrolled at Olchfa Comprehensive School aged eleven . In his first year , the main school buildings were closed off for renovation after inspectors discovered the cement used in construction caused other public buildings to collapse . Lessons were held in portable buildings instead , which influenced his imagination to create mystery , science @-@ fiction , and conspiracy thriller stories about the main building . He also immersed himself in books such as Sons and Lovers by D. H. Lawrence and The Crystal Mouse by Babs H Deal ; the latter influenced him so much he could " see it echoing in anything " he wrote . At age 14 , he auditioned for and joined the newly formed West Glamorgan Youth Theatre Company ( <unk> ) . The group 's founder and director , Godfrey Evans , considered him to be " a total all @-@ rounder " who was talented and popular with the other students . Working with the group allowed him to define his sexual identity : he embarked on a several @-@ month relationship with fellow youth thespian <unk> Morgan , and later came out as homosexual in his teenage years . 
 In 1979 , Davies completed his O @-@ Levels and stayed at Olchfa with the ambition to study English literature at the University of Oxford ; he abandoned his aspirations of becoming a comic artist after a careers advisor convinced him his colour @-@ blindness would make that path unlikely . During his studies , he participated in the <unk> 's assignments to create Welsh language drama to be performed at the National Eisteddfod of Wales , including Pair <unk> , a play based on the Mabinogion myth cycle , and <unk> , a drama about community belonging and identity in early @-@ 1980s West Glamorgan . In 1981 , he was accepted by Worcester College , Oxford to study English literature . At Oxford , he realised that he was enamoured with the narrative aspect of fiction , especially nineteenth @-@ century literature such as Charles Dickens . 
 Davies continued to submit scripts to the WGYT during his studies at Oxford : Box , a play about the influence of television that Evans noted contained Davies ' penchants for misdirecting the audience and mixing comedy and drama ; In Her Element , which centred on the animation of still objects , and Hothouse , an Alan Bennett @-@ inspired piece about internal politics in an advertising office . In 1984 , he made his final performance for the WGYT and signed up for a course in Theatre Studies at Cardiff University after graduating from Oxford . He worked sporadically for the Sherman Theatre 's publicity department and claimed unemployment benefit in the interim . In 1985 , Davies began his professional television career after a friend suggested that he should talk to a television producer who was seeking a temporary graphic artist for the children 's show Why Don 't You ? 
 = = Children 's television career = = 
 Davies was taken on as a member of the BBC Wales children 's department in 1985 and given one @-@ day contracts and commissions , such as illustrating for Why Don 't You ? As he was only given three days of work per month by the BBC , he continued to freelance and volunteer for the Sherman Theatre . In 1986 , he was approached by the Sunday Sport before its launch to provide a football @-@ themed daily strip ; he declined because he was concerned about the pornographic content of the newspaper . He submitted a script for Crossroads in response to an appeal for new writers ; it was not used because the show was cancelled in 1987 . He ultimately abandoned his graphic art career entirely when he realised in his early twenties that he enjoyed writing the dialogue of a comic more than creating the art . 
 On 1 June 1987 , Davies made his first and only appearance as a television presenter on Play School alongside regular presenter Chloë Ashcroft . Why Don 't You ? line producer Peter Charlton suggested that he would " be good on camera " and advised him to take his career public . Davies was granted the opportunity for sporadic appearances over a period of six months ; he hosted only one episode as a storytelling illustrator before he walked off the set and commented he was " not doing that again " . The appearance remains an in @-@ joke in the industry , and the recordings were invariably requested for wrap parties Davies attended . 
 On Why Don 't You ? , Davies took on varying jobs , including researcher , director , illustrator , assistant floor manager and unofficial publicist for fan @-@ mail . He was offered his first professional scriptwriting job in 1986 by show producer Dave Evans ; he had entered Evans 's office to collect his wages and was offered an extra £ 100 to write a replacement script . Davies 's script was positively reviewed in the department and led to increasingly larger roles that culminated in a six @-@ month contract to write for the show after it relocated to Manchester in 1988 . He worked for the show for two more years and eventually became the show 's producer . He oversaw an increase in drama which tripled its audience — despite the fact BBC Manchester was not permitted by the corporation to create children 's dramas — which reached its climax with his last episode : a drama where the Why Don 't You ? protagonists , led by the show 's longest running presenter Ben Slade , were trapped in a café by a supercomputer that tried to kill them . 
 While producing Why Don 't You ? , Davies branched out within the children 's department at BBC Manchester : he attended directors ' courses ; wrote for older audiences with his contributions to DEF II and On the Waterfront ; and accompanied Keith Chegwin to Norway to assist in the production of a children 's documentary about politics . The head of the children 's department , Ed Pugh , offered him the chance to produce Breakfast Serials , a new series scheduled for an 8 : 00 am slot . Breakfast Serials incorporated elements of non @-@ sequitur comedy and popular culture references aimed at older pupils , such as a parody of Land of the Giants . He decided to leave the children 's department and the BBC during the production of Breakfast Serials : a friend called him after the first episode was transmitted and observed that he had " broadcast a joke about the juvenilia of Emily Brontë at eight o 'clock in the morning " ; the conversation caused him to reflect that he was writing for the wrong audience . Davies produced three more children 's series while he pursued an adult drama career : Dark Season , Century Falls , and Children 's Ward . 
 = = = Dark Season and Century Falls = = = 
 During his tenure on Why Don 't You ? , Davies oversaw the production of a story that took place in Loch Ness . The story was the precursor for his first freelance children 's project : Dark Season . The show , originally called The <unk> Three , would feature the Why Don 't You ? characters in a purely dramatic setting that was influenced by his childhood . He submitted the script to the head of the BBC 's Children 's department , Anna Home , and Granada Television . Both companies were interested in producing the show with minor changes : Granada wished to produce it as one six @-@ part serial , as opposed to Davies ' plan of two three @-@ part serials ; and Home was interested in accepting the show on the condition it included a new cast of characters . He accepted Home 's offer , and the show was allocated the budget and timeslot of Maid Marian and her Merry Men , which had been put on hiatus the year before . 
 The first three episodes of Dark Season feature three young teenagers in a contemporary secondary school , <unk> ( Kate Winslet ) , Marcie ( Victoria Lambert ) , and Tom ( Ben Chandler ) , who discover a plot by the villain Mr Eldritch ( Grant Parsons ) to take over the world using school computers . Eldritch is eventually defeated by Marcie and the computer expert Professor <unk> ( Rosalie Crutchley ) . The next three episodes focus on a new villain : the archaeologist Miss Pendragon ( Jacqueline Pearce ) , later described by Davies as a " devil worshipping Nazi lesbian " , who becomes a part of the ancient supercomputer Behemoth . The two distinct plot elements converge at the end of the fifth episode , when Pendragon crashes through the school stage as Eldritch walks into the auditorium . 
 Dark Season uses concepts seen in his tenure as executive producer of Doctor Who : " School Reunion " , written by Toby Whithouse , shares its concept of the antagonist using computers in a comprehensive school to take over the world ; " Army of Ghosts " unexpectedly brings together the series ' two major villains for the final episode ; and the characters of Marcie and her friends are similar , albeit unintentionally , to the structure of the Doctor and his companions . Dark Season was the first series that he was credited as " Russell T Davies " — the initial arbitrarily chosen to distinguish himself from the BBC Radio 4 presenter — and the first series that he was commissioned to write a novelisation : it features a more ambiguous climax and foreshadows a sequel set in an arcade similar to the one featured in The Sarah Jane Adventures serial , Warriors of <unk> . 
 Davies started planning a second series for Dark Season that followed a similar structure . The first half of the series would take part in the arcade mentioned in the novelisation , and the second would feature the appearance of psychic twins and the re @-@ emergence of the villain Eldritch . The concepts were transferred to its spiritual successor , Century Falls , which was produced in 1993 at the request of Dark Season director Colin Cant . The series primarily used the " psychic twins " concept and was set in an isolated village based on those in the Yorkshire Dales and the North York Moors . 
 The plot of Century Falls is driven by a legend that no children had been born in the eponymous village for more than forty years . The lead protagonist , Tess Hunter ( Catherine Sanderson ) , is an overweight teenager who moves to the village with her mother at the beginning of the serial . She quickly befriends the psychic Ben Naismith ( Simon Fenton ) and his twin sister Carey ( Emma Jane Lavin ) . The three teenagers examine the waterfall that gave Ben his powers and the disaster that caused the legendary infertility . The serial climaxes in a confrontation between Tess and the deity Century , who is attempting to fuse with Tess 's unborn sister . 
 Century Falls is conceptually much darker than its predecessor Dark Season and his later work , which Davies attributed to a trend that inexperienced writers " get off on the dark stuff " : in a BAFTA interview with Davies , Home recalled that she " very nearly got into trouble because it did actually push at the boundaries which some of the powers @-@ that @-@ be would rather not have been pushed " ; and a Daily Mail review of the series considered the show 's themes of arson , black magic , and communal fear as being " on a scale normally reserved for peak @-@ time adult viewing " . The series offered a sense of realism in its protagonist , who is not heroic and aspirational , has poor social skills , and is bluntly described by Ben as a " fat girl " , a practice that the Daily Mail praised as " something that defies the Thought Police " . Century Falls was the last script he wrote for the BBC 's children 's department for fourteen years . He had begun to formulate another successor : The Heat of the Sun , a series set over Christmas 1999 and New Year 's Day 2000 that would have included the concepts of psychic powers and world domination . 
 = = = Children 's Ward = = = 
 While he was writing Dark Season and Century Falls , Davies sought freelance projects elsewhere , including three scripts for the BBC children 's comedy <unk> . One venture in 1991 led him to Granada Television , where he edited scripts for the ITV children 's medical drama Children 's Ward under the supervision of eventual Coronation Street producer Tony Wood and his former boss Ed Pugh . By 1992 , he had been promoted to producer and oversaw an increase in discussion of larger contemporary issues . In 1993 , he wrote a script featuring a teenage boy who had been infected with HIV via a blood transfusion , which challenged the prevalent assumption that only gay people contracted HIV : 
 Jason Lloyd 
 You must be a poof if you 've got AIDS . 
 Richard Higgs 
 I 'm not gay , and I haven 't got AIDS ; I 'm HIV positive . But just for the sake of an argument let 's say I was homosexual . Would it matter ? What difference would it make ? 
 Jason 
 [ You 'd ] fancy me , wouldn 't you ? 
 Richard 
 There 's not a boy , girl , man , or woman alive who could possibly fancy you . Look around . Where 's this queue of people dying to ask you out ? They don 't exist , Jason , because you 're stupid , you 're bigoted , and you don 't matter one little bit . 
 Davies left the role of producer in 1994 , but continued to write for the series on occasion . Notably , he was requested to write the 100th episode of the series , by then called The Ward , which aired in October 1996 . Instead of celebrating the milestone , he wrote a script about a recently emerging threat : paedophiles in online chat @-@ rooms . The episode was about an X @-@ Files fan who was drawn in by a paedophile 's offer of a rare magazine . In the dénouement of the episode , the child recounts the tale of his near abduction and describes his attacker as " just a man like any other man " . The episode earned Davies his first BAFTA award : the 1997 Children 's BAFTA for Best Drama . 
 = = Adult television career ( 1994 – 2004 ) = = 
 During his production tenure on Children 's Ward , Davies continued to seek other freelance writing jobs , particularly for soap operas ; his intention was to eventually work on the popular and long @-@ running Granada soap Coronation Street . In pursuit of this career plan , he storylined soaps such as Families and wrote scripts for shows such as Cluedo , a game show based on the board game of the same name , and Do the Right Thing , a localised version of the Brazilian panel show <unk> Decide with Terry Wogan as presenter and Frank Skinner as a regular panellist . One writing job , for The House of Windsor , a soap opera about footmen in Buckingham Palace , was so poorly received that his other scripts for the show would be written under the pseudonym Leo Vaughn . 
 In 1994 , Davies quit all of his producing jobs , and was offered a scriptwriting role on the late @-@ night soap opera Revelations , created by him , Tony Wood , and Brian B. Thompson . The series was a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek deconstruction of organised religion , and featured his first overtly homosexual character : a lesbian vicar portrayed by Sue Holderness , who came out of the closet in a two @-@ hander episode with Carole Nimmons . 
 Davies attributes the revelation about Holderness 's character as a consequence of both the " pressure cooker nature " of the show and the recent ordination of female vicars in the Church of England . He let his contract with Granada expire and pitched a new early @-@ evening soap opera to Channel 4 , RU , with its creator Bill Moffat , Sandra Hastie , a producer on Moffat 's previous series Press Gang , and co @-@ writer Paul Cornell . Although the slot was eventually taken by Hollyoaks , he and Cornell mutually benefited from the pitch : Davies introduced Cornell to the Children 's Ward producers and established contact with Moffat 's son Steven , and Cornell introduced Davies to Virgin Publishing . Davies wrote one Doctor Who Virgin New Adventures novel , Damaged Goods , in which the Doctor tracks a Class A drug tainted by Time Lord technology across several galaxies . The book includes several themes that Davies would intersperse in his later works — including a family called " Tyler " and companion Chris <unk> participating in casual homosexual sex — and a subplot formed the inspiration for The Mother War , a proposed but never produced thriller for Granada about a woman , Eva Jericho , and a calcified foetus in her uterus . 
 Davies continued to propose dramas to Channel 4 , including Springhill , an apocalyptic soap @-@ opera , co @-@ created by Frank Cottrell Boyce and Paul Abbott , which aired simultaneously on Sky One and Channel 4 in 1996 – 1997 . Set in suburban Liverpool , the series focuses on the devoutly Catholic Freeman family and their encounter and conflict with Eva Morrigan ( Katharine Rogers ) . 
 He storylined for the second series , but submitted fewer scripts ; Granada had commissioned him to write for their soap The Grand , temporarily storyline for Coronation Street , and write the straight @-@ to @-@ video special , Coronation Street : Viva Las Vegas ! . The second series of Springhill continued his penchant for symbolism ; in particular , it depicted Marion Freeman ( Judy Holt ) and Eva as personifications of good and evil , and climaxed with a finale set in an ultra @-@ liberal dystopian future where premarital sex and homosexuality are embraced by the Church . Boyce later commented that without Davies 's input , the show would have been a " dry run " for Abbott 's hit show Shameless . 
 = = = The Grand = = = 
 Davies 's next project was The Grand , a period soap drama set in a Manchester hotel during the interwar period . It was designed to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9 pm on a Friday night . After the original writer abandoned the series , Granada approached him to write the entire show . His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period ; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff , including a soldier 's execution for desertion , a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive , and a multi @-@ episode storyline centred on the chambermaid , Monica Jones ( Jane Danson ) , who kills her rapist in self @-@ defence , is arrested , and eventually hanged for murder . The show was renewed for a second series despite the first 's dark tone . 
 The second series had a lighter tone and greater emphasis on character development , which Davies attributed to his friend Sally , who had previously warned him of the adult humour in Breakfast Serials ; she told him that his show was too bleak to be compared to real life . He highlighted the sixth and eighth episodes of the second series as a time of maturity as a writer : for the sixth , he utilised then @-@ unconventional narrative devices such as flashbacks to explore the hotel barman 's closeted homosexuality and the societal attitudes towards sexuality in the 1920s ; and he highlighted the eighth as when he allowed the series to " take on its own life " by deliberately inserting plot devices such as <unk> to enhance the comic relief of the series . 
 Although well received , the series ' ratings were not high enough to warrant a third series . After its cancellation in September 1997 , Davies had an existential crisis after almost dying from an accidental overdose ; the experience persuaded him to detoxify and make a name for himself by producing a series that celebrated his homosexuality . 
 = = = Queer as Folk = = = 
 After his near @-@ death experience , Davies started to develop a series for Channel 4 which reflected the " hedonistic lifestyle " of the gay quarter of Manchester he was leaving behind . Encouraged by ex @-@ Granada executives Catriona MacKenzie and <unk> Neil to " go gay " , the series focused on a group of friends in Manchester 's gay scene , tentatively titled The Other End of the Ballroom , and later , Queer as Fuck . 
 By February 1998 , when he completed the first draft for the series première , the series was known under its eventual title Queer as Folk . The series emulates dramas such as Band of Gold in presenting realistic discussion on sexuality , as opposed to " one @-@ sided " gay characters in soap operas such as EastEnders , and eschews " heavy @-@ handed discussion " of issues such as HIV , instead focusing on the party scene on Canal Street . 
 After he wrote the pilot , he approached actors for the main characters . Christopher Eccleston was Davies 's first choice for the role of Stuart Jones ; Eccleston declined because of his age and suggested his friend Aidan Gillen instead . The roles of Vince Tyler and Nathan Maloney were quickly given to Craig Kelly and Charlie Hunnam , and the secondary character Alexander Perry , originally written for the television producer Phil Collinson during his brief acting career , was portrayed by Antony Cotton , who later played the gay character Sean Tully in Coronation Street . The series was allocated a £ 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 budget , and was produced by Red Productions , owned by his friend and former colleague Nicola Shindler , and filmed by Cracker and Hillsborough director Charles McDougall and The Grand director Sarah Hardin on location in Manchester . The eight 40 @-@ minute episodes emulated experiences from his social life and includes an episode where the minor character Phil Delaney ( Jason <unk> ) dies of a cocaine overdose , unnoticed by his social circle . 
 The series was transmitted in early 1999 , when Parliament were discussing LGBT equality ; the series première aired on the day the House of Lords was discussing the Sexual Offences Bill 1999 , which eventually reduced the age of consent for homosexual couples to 16 . The première was controversial , in particular because it depicted the character Nathan , aged 15 , in sexual intercourse with an older man ; the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom received 136 complaints and the series received criticism from Hunnam 's parents and from activist Mary Whitehouse . The controversy was amplified when the sponsor Beck 's withdrew after several episodes and homosexual activists complained that the series was not representative of gay culture . Nevertheless , the show garnered 3 @.@ 5 million viewers per episode and a generally positive reaction from fans , and was renewed for a two @-@ episode special due for the following year . 
 Queer as Folk 2 was broadcast in February 2000 and was driven by the plot element of Vince 's half @-@ sister 's wedding . The specials place emphasis on Vince and Stuart 's relationship , and ends with their departure for another gay scene in a pastiche of Grease , as Nathan took the role as the leader of the Manchester scene 's next generation . On the heels of the special , Davies pitched the spin @-@ off Misfits , a late @-@ night soap opera set in a boarding house owned by Vince 's mother , Hazel , and The Second Coming , a series that depicted the Second Coming of Christ in contemporary Manchester . Misfits was rejected in December 2000 and The Second Coming was initially approved by Channel 4 but later rejected after a change of executive personnel . Instead of contesting the cancellation of The Second Coming , he left Channel 4 and vowed to not work with them again . 
 = = = Bob & Rose = = = 
 Shindler continued to pitch The Second Coming to other television networks while Davies sought other ventures . His next series was based on a gay friend who married a woman and fathered a child . He saw the relationship as a promising concept for an unconventional love story and asked the couple about their relationship to develop the show . After developing the series around the prejudice that he and his gay friends had shown , he realised he was creating caricatures for the purpose of exposing them , and instead focused on telling a traditional love story and gave the couple the traditionally British names of Bob Gossage and Rose Cooper . 
 To simulate a classic love story , the plot required antagonists , in the form of Bob 's best friend and fellow teacher Holly Vance and Rose 's boyfriend Andy Lewis ( Daniel Ryan ) . While Andy , named after Davies 's boyfriend Andrew Smith , was a minor character and departed in the third episode , Holly featured throughout the entirety of the series . Bob & Rose thus followed a similar format to Queer as Folk , in particular , the triumvirate of main characters composed of a couple and an outsider who lived in contemporary Manchester , and inverted the traditional " coming out " story by focusing on Bob 's uncharacteristic attraction to Rose ; Bob describes his sexual life by simply speaking the line " I fancy men . And her . " The series was similar to the Kevin Smith film Chasing Amy ( 1997 ) , as they both portrayed a romance between a straight character and gay character and the resulting ostracism from the couple 's social circles , much like The Second Coming shared its concept with Smith 's 1999 film Dogma . 
 Like Queer as Folk , Bob & Rose contributed to the contemporary political debate regarding LGBT rights : a subplot involves the fictional pressure group Parents Against <unk> ( PAH ) , led by Bob 's mother Monica ( Penelope Wilton ) , an ardent gay rights activist , and their campaign to repeal Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 , which prohibited local authorities from " intentionally <unk> [ ing ] " homosexuality . The subplot climaxes in the fourth episode , when Monica and Bob lead a rally into direct action by handcuffing themselves to a bus run by a company whose management donated millions to keeping the law on the books ; the scene directly parallels protests against the transport company Stagecoach due to their founder Brian Souter 's financial and political support of Section 28 — at one point , Davies intended to explicitly name Stagecoach in the script — and is inspired by earlier protests undertaken by the LGBT rights pressure group OutRage ! . 
 After successfully pitching the show to ITV , Red Productions joined Davies in casting the show and initially approached Jonathan Creek star Alan Davies to portray Bob . Although he was not gay , Alan Davies accepted the role and spent several weeks researching first @-@ hand Manchester 's gay scene with series director Joe Wright . His only objection to the role was Bob being a fan of Manchester United F.C. , the team Shindler had named Red Productions for , because of his prolific support of Arsenal F.C. The part of Rose was given to Lesley Sharp , her first leading role after her portrayal of secondary characters in past Red shows Playing the Field and Clocking Off , and Jessica Stevenson was cast as Holly by ITV Head of Drama Nick Elliott on the basis of her performance in the Channel 4 comedy Spaced . 
 The series was filmed in the southern suburbs of Manchester between March and June 2001 and often used Davies 's own home as a green room . The series was the only Red – Davies collaboration not to be scored by future Doctor Who composer Murray Gold ; the soundtrack was a Martin Phipps composition inspired by Hans Zimmer 's work on the 1993 film True Romance . It aired on Monday nights in September and October 2001 . Although critically acclaimed , and eventually won two British Comedy Awards and a British Academy Television Award nomination , the series had lower viewing figures than expected and was moved to a later timeslot for the final two episodes . Although the series was not as successful as he hoped , the show helped Davies rekindle his relationship with his mother shortly before her death , just after the transmission of the fourth episode , which he sees as " possibly the best thing [ he has ] ever written " . 
 = = = The Second Coming = = = 
 Shortly after the transmission of Bob & Rose , Davies was approached by Abbott to write for his new BBC show Linda Green . He accepted the offer and wrote an episode where the titular character ( portrayed by Liza Tarbuck ) and her friends attend a schoolmate 's funeral and become psychologically haunted by the deceased woman 's solitary life . His first work for the BBC in eight years prompted them to approach him with additional concepts for period dramas , which he invariably declined as his sole intent was to revive Doctor Who , which had then been on hiatus for over a decade . 
 In 2002 , he met with the BBC to discuss the revival of the show and producing The Second Coming ; the BBC were unable to commit to either , and he again declined to work for them . After the BBC rejected The Second Coming , Shindler proposed that the series should be pitched to ITV . Despite the story 's controversial message , the critical success of Bob & Rose encouraged the channel to commission the series for broadcast . 
 The Second Coming had been several years in the making and endured many rewrites from the first draft presented to Channel 4 in 2000 , but retained its key concept of a depiction of the Second Coming of Christ with a humanity @-@ centred deity . A major removal from the script , due to time constraints , was a long sequence titled " Night of the Demons " : the main character , a shop assistant , Stephen Baxter , who discovers his divine lineage , takes over a hotel with his disciples and eventually encounters several of the hotel 's employees that have been possessed by the Devil . Several similar sequences were removed to create a thriller set in the days before Judgement Day . 
 An experienced actor was required to portray Stephen ; Davies approached Christopher Eccleston , who had previously been approached for the role of Stuart in Queer as Folk , based on his performance as Nicky Hutchinson in the drama Our Friends in the North . Eccleston accepted the role and helped Davies make the character more human after he observed that " Baxter was getting lost amid his loftier pronouncements " . The character of Judith , who would represent the fall of God , was given to Lesley Sharp after her performance in Bob & Rose , and the role of the Devil was given to Mark Benton . 
 The Second Coming was controversial from its conception . When it was a Channel 4 project , it was the subject of a Sunday Express article a year before its original projected transmission date of late @-@ 2001 . The series would again receive criticism when it was rumoured it would be broadcast over the Easter weekend of 2003 . The series was eventually broadcast over consecutive nights on 9 – 10 February 2003 to 6 @.@ 3 million and 5 @.@ 4 million viewers respectively , and received mixed reactions from the audience : Davies reportedly received death threats for its atheistic message and criticism for its anticlimactic ending , as well as two nominations for Television Awards and one for a Royal Television Society Award . 
 = = = Mine All Mine = = = 
 In the time near his mother 's death , Davies returned to Swansea several times and reflected on the role of family . During one visit , he realised that he had not yet written a series set in Wales ; hence , he started creating a series about a family who discovers that they own the entire city of Swansea . The Vivaldi Inheritance , later renamed Mine All Mine , was based on the tale of the Welsh pirate Robert Edwards and his descendants ' claim to 77 acres ( 310 @,@ 000 m2 ) of real estate in Lower Manhattan , New York City . The series was a departure from his trend of experimental social commentary ; it was instead designed to be a mainstream comedy that utilised Welsh actors : Davies and Red Productions even planned a cameo appearance by Academy Award @-@ winning Swansea @-@ born Catherine Zeta @-@ Jones . 
 Because the series was centred on an entire family , Red Productions was given the task of casting eleven principal characters : the role of family patriarch Max Vivaldi was given to Griff Rhys Jones , at the request of ITV for prolific actors ; <unk> Morgan , Davies ' ex @-@ girlfriend from the WGYT , was cast as Max 's wife Val ; Sharon Morgan as Max 's sister Stella ; Joanna Page as Candy Vivaldi ; Matthew Barry and <unk> Morris as the Vivaldi siblings Loe and Maria ; Hi @-@ de @-@ Hi ! actress Ruth Madoc as Val 's sister Myrtle Jones ; and Jason Hughes as Maria 's boyfriend Gethin . The series , specifically the family 's composition of two daughters and a gay son , mirrored his own upbringing to the point where Davies and his boyfriend referred to the show as " The Private Joke " . 
 The series was originally written in six parts , but Davies excised a large portion of the fifth episode because the crew expressed concerns with its pacing . The series was filmed in late 2003 under the direction of Sheree <unk> and Tim Whitby , and utilised many areas of Swansea that Davies was familiar with since his childhood . It aired as four @-@ hour @-@ long episodes and a ninety @-@ minute finale on Thursday nights preceding Christmas 2003 . Eventually , Mine All Mine would be his least successful series and ended its run with just over two million viewers , which he later blamed on the series ' high eccentricity . 
 = = = Casanova = = = 
 Shortly after the transmission of Mine All Mine , the BBC commissioned Davies to produce the revival of Doctor Who , which completed his decade @-@ long quest to return the series to the airwaves . At the time , he was developing two scripts : the first , a cinematic adaptation of the Charles Ingram @-@ Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? scandal , was cancelled after he accepted the Doctor Who job ; and the second , a dramatisation of the life of the Venetian adventurer and lover Giacomo Casanova , was his next show with Red Productions . 
 Davies 's association with Casanova began when London Weekend Television producers Julie Gardner , Michele Buck , and Damien Timmer approached him to write a 21st @-@ century adaptation of Casanova 's memoirs . He accepted to script the series because it was " the best subject in the world " and , after reading the memoirs , sought to create a realistic depiction of Casanova instead of further perpetuating the stereotype of a hypersexual lover . The series was originally written for ITV , but was turned down after he could not agree on the length of the serial . Shortly after ITV declined to produce Casanova , Gardner took up a position as Head of Drama at BBC Wales and brought the concept with her . The BBC agreed to fund the series , but could only release the money required if a regionally based independent company produced the series . Davies turned to Shindler , who agreed to become the serial 's fifth executive producer . 
 Davies 's script takes place in two distinct time frames and required two different actors for the eponymous role : the older Casanova was portrayed by Peter O 'Toole , and the younger Casanova was portrayed by David Tennant . The serial takes place primarily during Casanova 's early adulthood and depicts his life among three women : his mother ( <unk> Kirwan ) , his lover Henriette ( Laura Fraser ) , and his consort Bellino ( Nina Sosanya ) . The script takes a different approach to Dennis Potter 's 1971 dramatisation ; instead of Potter 's focus on sex and misogyny , the 2005 serial focuses on Casanova 's compassion and respect for women . 
 Casanova was filmed alongside the first few episodes of the new series of Doctor Who , which meant producers common to both projects , including Davies and Gardner , made daily journeys between the former 's production in Lancashire and Cheshire and the latter 's production in Cardiff . Red Productions also filmed on location overseas in a stately home in Dubrovnik , and alongside production of the identically titled 2005 Lasse Hallström film in Venice . The two production teams shared resources and were given the unofficial names of " Little Casanova " and " Big Casanova " respectively . When it premièred on BBC Three in March 2005 , the first episode attracted 940 @,@ 000 viewers , a record for a first @-@ run drama on the channel , but was overshadowed on BBC One by the return of Doctor Who in the same month . 
 = = Doctor Who ( 2005 – 2010 ) and beyond = = 
 Since he watched the First Doctor 's ( William Hartnell ) regeneration into the Second Doctor ( Patrick Troughton ) at the end of the 1966 serial The Tenth Planet , Davies had " fallen in love " with the show and , by the mid @-@ 1970s , he was regularly writing reviews of broadcast serials in his diary . His favourite writer and childhood hero was Robert Holmes ; during his career , he has complimented the creative use of BBC studios to create " terror and claustrophobia " for Holmes 's 1975 script The Ark in Space — his favourite serial from the original series — and has opined that the first episode of The Talons of Weng @-@ Chiang ( 1977 ) featured " the best dialogue ever written ; it 's up there with Dennis Potter " . His screenwriting career also began with a Doctor Who submission ; in 1987 , he submitted a spec script set on an intergalactic news aggregator and broadcaster , which was rejected by script editor Andrew Cartmel , who suggested that he should write a more prosaic story about " a man who is worried about his mortgage , his marriage , [ and ] his dog " . The script was eventually retooled and transmitted as " The Long Game " in 2005 . 
 During the late 1990s , Davies lobbied the BBC to revive the show from its hiatus and reached the discussion stages in late 1998 and early 2002 . His proposals would update the show to be better suited for a 21st @-@ century audience : the series would be recorded on film instead of videotape ; the length of each episode would double from twenty @-@ five minutes to fifty ; episodes would primarily take place on Earth , in the style of the Third Doctor ( Jon Pertwee ) UNIT episodes ; and Davies would remove " excess baggage " from the mythology such as Gallifrey and the Time Lords . His pitch competed against three others : Dan Freedman 's fantasy retelling , Matthew Graham 's Gothic @-@ styled pitch , and Mark Gatiss 's reboot , which made the Doctor the audience surrogate character , instead of his companions . Davies also took cues from American fantasy television series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Smallville , most notably Buffy 's concepts of series @-@ long story arcs and the " Big Bad " . 
 In August 2003 , the BBC had resolved legal issues over production rights that had surfaced as a result of the jointly produced Universal Studios – BBC – FOX 1996 Doctor Who film , and the Controller of BBC One Lorraine Heggessey and Controller of Drama Commissioning Jane Tranter approached Gardner and Davies to create a revival of the series to air in a primetime slot on Saturday nights , as part of their plan to devolve production to its regional bases . By mid @-@ September , they accepted the deal to produce the series alongside Casanova . 
 Davies 's pitch for Doctor Who was the first one he wrote voluntarily ; previously , he opted to outline concepts of shows to commissioning executives and offer to write the pilot episode because he felt that a pitch made him " feel like [ he 's ] killing the work " . The fifteen @-@ page pitch outlined a Doctor who was " your best friend ; someone you want to be with all the time " , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) as a " perfect match " for the new Doctor , avoidance of the 40 @-@ year back story " except for the good bits " , the retention of the TARDIS , sonic screwdriver , and Daleks , removal of the Time Lords , and a greater focus on humanity . His pitch was submitted for the first production meeting in December 2003 and a series of thirteen episodes was obtained by pressure from BBC Worldwide and a workable budget from Julie Gardner . 
 The first new series of Doctor Who featured eight scripts by Davies ; the remainder were allocated to experienced dramatists and writers for the show 's ancillary releases : Steven Moffat penned a two @-@ episode story , and Mark Gatiss , Robert Shearman , and Paul Cornell each wrote one script . Davies also approached his old friend Paul Abbott and Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling to write for the series ; both declined due to existing commitments . Shortly after he secured writers for the show , Davies stated that he had no intention of approaching writers from the old series ; the only writer he would have wished to work with was Holmes , who died in May 1986 . 
 By early 2004 , the show had settled into a regular production cycle . Davies , Gardner , and BBC Controller of Continuing Drama Series Mal Young took posts as executive producers , and Phil Collinson , his old colleague from Granada , took the role of producer . Davies 's official position as showrunner combined the roles of head writer and executive producer and consisted of laying a skeletal plot for the entire series , holding " tone meetings " to correctly identify the tone of an episode , often described in one word — for example , the " tone word " for Moffat 's " The Empty Child " was " romantic " — and overseeing all aspects of production . 
 The production team was also tasked with finding a suitable actor for the role of the Doctor . Most notably , they approached film actor Hugh Grant and comedian Rowan Atkinson for the role . By the time Young suggested The Second Coming and Our Friends in the North actor Christopher Eccleston to Davies , Eccleston was one of three left in the running for the role : the other candidates are rumoured to have been Alan Davies and Bill Nighy . Eccleston created his own characteristics of his rendition of the Doctor based on Davies 's life , most notably , his catchphrase " Fantastic ! " : 
 [ The central message of the show is ] seize life , it 's brief , enjoy it . The Doctor is always saying " isn 't it fantastic ? " , which is one of Russell 's favourite words . " Look at that blue alien , isn 't it fantastic ? Oh , it 's trying to kill me . Never mind , let 's solve it . " 
 Filming for the show started in July 2004 on location in Cardiff for " Rose " . The start of filming created stress among the production team because of unseen circumstances : several scenes from the first block had to be re @-@ shot because the original footage was unusable ; the Slitheen prosthetics for " Aliens of London " , " World War Three " , and " Boom Town " were noticeably different from their computer @-@ generated counterparts ; and the BBC came to a gridlock in negotiations with the Terry Nation estate to secure the Daleks for the sixth episode of the series ; Davies and episode writer Rob Shearman were forced to rework the script to feature another race , until Gardner was able to secure the rights a month later . After the first production block , which he described as " hitting a brick wall " , the show 's production was markedly eased as the crew familiarised themselves . 
 The first episode of the revived Doctor Who , " Rose " , aired on 26 March 2005 and received 10 @.@ 8 million viewers and favourable critical reception . Four days after the transmission of " Rose " , Tranter approved a Christmas special and a second series . The press release was overshadowed by a leaked announcement that Christopher Eccleston would leave the role after one series ; in response , David Tennant was announced as Eccleston 's replacement . 
 Tennant had been offered the role when he was watching a pre @-@ transmission copy of Doctor Who with Davies and Gardner . Tennant initially believed the offer was a joke , but after he realised they were serious , he accepted the role and made his first appearance in the dénouement of " The Parting of the Ways " , the final episode of the first series . Doctor Who continued to be one of BBC 's flagship programmes throughout Davies ' tenure , and resulted in record sales of the show 's official magazine , an increase in spin @-@ off novels , and the launch of the children 's magazine Doctor Who Adventures and toy sonic screwdrivers and Daleks . The show 's popularity ultimately led to a resurgence in family @-@ orientated Saturday night drama ; the ITV science @-@ fiction series Primeval and the BBC historical dramas Robin Hood and Merlin were specifically designed for an early Saturday evening timeslot . Davies was also approached by the BBC to produce several spin @-@ off series , eventually creating two : Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures . 
 = = = Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures = = = 
 In October 2005 , BBC Three Controller Stuart Murphy invited Davies to create a post @-@ watershed Doctor Who spin @-@ off in the wake of the parent series ' popularity . Torchwood — named after an <unk> title ruse used to prevent leaks of Doctor Who 's first series — incorporated elements from an abandoned Davies project titled Excalibur and featured the pansexual 51st century time @-@ traveler Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) and a team of alien hunters in Cardiff . The show began production in April 2006 and was marketed through foreshadowing in the main story arc of Doctor Who 's second series , which portrayed Torchwood as a covert quasi @-@ governmental organisation that monitors , exploits , and suppresses the existence of extraterrestrial life and technology . Upon its transmission , Torchwood was one of BBC Three 's most popular shows ; however , it received criticism for " adolescent " use of sexual and violent themes . This led the production team to alter the format to be subtler in its portrayal of adult themes . 
 Concurrently , he was approached to produce a CBBC show which was described as Young Doctor Who . Davies was reluctant to diminish the mystery of the Doctor 's character and instead pitched a show with Elisabeth Sladen as the once @-@ popular companion Sarah Jane Smith : The Sarah Jane Adventures , which follows Sarah Jane and local schoolchildren as they investigate extraterrestrial events in the London Borough of Ealing . The show was given a backdoor pilot as the Doctor Who episode " School Reunion " and premièred in its own right with " Invasion of the Bane " on 1 January 2007 . The show was more successful than its 1981 predecessor K @-@ 9 and Company ; it received more favourable reviews than Torchwood and a significant periphery demographic that compared the show to 1970s Doctor Who episodes . 
 The workload of managing three separate shows prompted Davies to delegate writing tasks for Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures to other writers so he could focus on writing Doctor Who . After Billie Piper 's departure as Rose Tyler in the second series finale " Doomsday " , he suggested a third spin @-@ off , Rose Tyler : Earth Defence , a compilation of annual bank holiday specials featuring Rose in a parallel universe version of Torchwood . He later reneged on his idea , as he believed that Rose should stay off screen , and abandoned the idea even though it had been budgeted . 
 = = = The Writer 's Tale , and writing the fourth series = = = 
 In September 2008 , BBC Books , an imprint of Random House Publishing , published The Writer 's Tale , a collection of emails between Davies and Radio Times and Doctor Who Magazine journalist Benjamin Cook . Dubbed the " Great Correspondence " by Davies and Cook , The Writer 's Tale covers a period between February 2007 and March 2008 and explores his writing processes and the development of his scripts for the fourth series of Doctor Who : " Voyage of the Damned " , " Partners in Crime " , " Midnight " , " Turn Left " , " The Stolen Earth " , and " Journey 's End " . The book 's first chapter focuses on Cook 's " big questions " on Davies ' writing style , character development — using the Doctor Who character Donna Noble ( Catherine Tate ) and the Skins character Tony Stonem ( Nicholas Hoult ) as contrasting examples — , how he formulated ideas for stories , and the question " why do you write ? " . After several weeks , Cook assumes an unofficial advisory role to the scriptwriting and the development of the series . The book 's epilogue consists of a short exchange between Davies and Cook : Cook changes from his role as " Invisible Ben " to " Visible Ben " and strongly advises to vastly alter the denouement to " Journey 's End " from a cliffhanger that led into " The Next Doctor " — which had occurred in the previous three series finales , " The Parting of the Ways " , " Doomsday " , and " Last of the Time Lords " — to a melancholy ending that showed the Doctor alone in the TARDIS . After three days of deliberation , Davies accepts Cook 's suggestion and thanks him for improving both episodes . 
 After its release , the pair embarked on a five @-@ stop signing tour to promote the book in October 2008 at Waterstone 's branches in London , Birmingham , Manchester , Bristol , and Cardiff . The book received positive reviews : Veronica <unk> of The Guardian wrote that Davies was the " Scheherazade of Cardiff Bay " and opined that the book should have been twice the published length ; Ian Berriman of science fiction magazine SFX gave the book five stars and commented that it was the only book about " new Who " that a reader needed ; television critic Charlie Brooker was inspired by the book to devote an entire episode of his BBC Four show Screenwipe to interviewing television writers ; and chat show couple Richard and Judy selected the book as a recommended Christmas present in the " Serious Non @-@ Fiction " category of their book club . A second edition of the book , The Writer 's Tale : The Final Chapter , was released in January 2010 by BBC Books . The second edition added 350 pages of correspondence — before excising draft scripts included in the first edition — and covered Davies ' final months as executive producer of Doctor Who as he co @-@ wrote the five @-@ part BBC One Torchwood miniseries Children of Earth , planned David Tennant 's departure and Matt Smith 's arrival as the Doctor , and moved to the United States . 
 = = = Move to California and Wizards vs. Aliens = = = 
 Davies departed from producing the show in 2009 along with Gardner and Collinson , and finished his tenure with four special length episodes . His departure from the show was announced in May 2008 , alongside a press release that named Steven Moffat as his successor . His role in late 2008 was split between writing the 2009 specials and preparing for the transition between his and Moffat 's production team ; one chapter of The Writer 's Tale : The Final Chapter discusses plans between him , Gardner , and Tennant to announce Tennant 's departure live during ITV 's National Television Awards in October 2008 . His final full script for Doctor Who was finished in the early morning of 4 March 2009 , and filming of the episode closed on 20 May 2009 . 
 Davies moved with Gardner and Jane Tranter to the United States in June 2009 , residing in Los Angeles , California . He continued to oversee production of Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures ; he wrote one story for the 2010 series of The Sarah Jane Adventures , Death of the Doctor , which included Matt Smith as the Doctor and Katy Manning as the Doctor 's former companion Jo Grant , and was the executive producer and author of the premiere ( " The New World " ) and finale ( " The Blood Line " ) of Torchwood : Miracle Day , the fourth series of Torchwood . He additionally gave informal assistance to and later served as creative consultant of ex @-@ Doctor Who script editor Helen Raynor 's and playwright Gary Owen 's BBC Cymru Wales drama , Baker Boys . 
 At the time of his departure to the United States , Davies planned to return to art by writing a graphic novel , and was approached by Lucasfilm to write for the proposed Star Wars live @-@ action television series but refused the commission . Davies ' residence in California ended in August 2011 after his boyfriend Andrew Smith was diagnosed with a brain tumour , which prompted Davies to postpone current projects and move back to Manchester with Smith so his partner could undergo treatment closer to their respective families . Davies ' move back to the United Kingdom enabled him to develop a replacement series for The Sarah Jane Adventures with prolific series writer Phil Ford after the former series ended due to Elisabeth Sladen 's death . Wizards vs Aliens , a CBBC drama about a teenage wizard and his scientist friend and their conflict with the alien <unk> who wish to destroy Earth , was formed to create a " genre clash " between science fiction and supernatural fantasy , as opposed to " culture clashes " such as Cowboys vs. Aliens . Davies additionally made his first contribution to CBeebies , with two scripts for Old Jack 's Boat , which stars Doctor Who alumni Bernard Cribbins and Freema Agyeman as retired fisherman Jack and his neighbour Shelley . 
 = = = Cucumber and Banana = = = 
 Davies ' next project after Doctor Who , codenamed More Gay Men , was a spiritual successor to Queer as Folk and would have focused on middle @-@ aged gay men in the Manchester gay scene . The show 's genesis dates back from 2001 , when his friend Carl Austin asked him " why are gay men so glad when we split up ? " . The show was due to enter into production in 2006 , but was indefinitely postponed due to the success of Doctor Who . Davies continued to develop ideas for the show , and explained a pivotal scene in the premiere to Cook in 2007 : 
 I can imagine a man who is so enraged by something tiny — the fact that his boyfriend won 't learn to swim — that he goes into a rage so great that , in one night , his entire life falls apart . It 's not about the learning to swim at all , of course , it 's about the way that your mind can fix on something small and use it as a gateway to a whole world of anger and pain ... If I write the Learn To Swim scene well — and it could be the spine of the whole drama — then I will be saying something about gay men , about couples , about communications , about anger . " 
 In 2011 , the series had entered into pre @-@ production , with American cable network Showtime contracted for transmission and BBC Worldwide for distribution . Showtime had reached the point of casting before Davies moved back to Manchester , at which point the series was picked up by Channel 4 to be produced with Nicola Shindler and the Red Production Company . The commission by Channel 4 marked Davies ' first collaboration with the channel since Queer as Folk and Shindler and Red since Casanova . Davies was convinced to return to the channel by Head of Drama and former Doctor Who executive producer Piers Wenger , who described the show as a " political piece of writing " that creates a " radical approach " to sexuality . 
 Cucumber focuses on the life of the middle @-@ aged Henry Best ( Vincent Franklin ) and the fallout from a disastrous date with his boyfriend of nine years , and is accompanied with Banana , an E4 anthology series featuring younger characters across the LGBT spectrum on the periphery of the Cucumber narrative , and Tofu , an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing modern sex , sexuality and issues arisen during the show with the cast and public . The three names reference a <unk> scale categorising the male erection by hardness from tofu to cucumber , and are used to symbolise differences in sexual attitudes and behaviour between the two generations . Although Cucumber is designed as a self @-@ contained serial focusing on the life of one man , Davies envisions Banana as open @-@ ended and believes it could continue after its sister series finishes . 
 Davies ' next project after Cucumber and Banana will be The Boys , a Channel 4 series about the HIV / AIDS crisis during the 1980s . The Boys will be a dramatised retrospective of the crisis which focuses on the men " living in the bedsits " during the 1980s as opposed to films such as Pride which focus on gay activists ; Davies notes that the stories regarding the politics of the crisis and the virus itself has been told , but not those regarding the early victims of the virus itself . Davies describes The Boys as a way of " coming to terms " with his own actions during the 1980s , when the shock of the crisis prevented him from properly mourning the deaths of his close friends . After The Boys , Davies plans to write a series about <unk> that draws inspiration from real @-@ life incidents of blackmail that resulted in suicide . 
 = = Writing style = = 
 Davies is an admitted <unk> and often waits hours or days for concepts to form before he commits them to the script . In The Writer 's Tale , he describes his procrastination by discussing his early career : at the time , his method of dealing with the pressures of delivering a script was to " go out drinking " instead . On one occasion in the mid @-@ 1990s , he was at the Manchester gay club Cruz 101 when he thought of the climax to the first series of The Grand . As his career progressed , he instead spent entire nights " just thinking of plot , character , pace , etc " and waited until 2 : 00 am , " when the clubs used to shut " , to overcome the urge of procrastination . Davies described the sense of anxiety he experiences in an email to Cook in April 2007 , in response to Cook 's question of " how do you know when to start writing ? " : 
 I leave it till the last minute . And then I leave it some more . Eventually , I leave it till I 'm desperate . ... I always think , I 'm not ready to write it , I don 't know what I 'm doing , it 's just a jumble of thoughts in a state of flux , there 's no story , I don 't know how A connects to B , I don 't know anything ! I get myself into a genuine state of panic . ... Normally , I 'll leave it till the deadline , and I haven 't even started writing . This has become , over the years , a week beyond the deadline , or even more . It can be a week — or weeks — past the delivery date , and I haven 't started writing . In fact , I don 't have delivery dates any more . I go by the start @-@ of @-@ preproduction date . I consider that to be my real deadline . And then I miss that . It 's a cycle that I cannot break . I simply can 't help it . It makes my life miserable . 
 He expanded on his email two weeks later in response to Cook 's query about the supposed link between major depressive disorder and creativity . He explained that his anxiety and melancholy during the scriptwriting period still allowed him to keep on top of his work ; on the other hand , he thought " Depression with a capital D [ didn 't provide ] any such luxury " . 
 Davies explained in length his writing process to Cook in The Writer 's Tale . When he creates characters , he initially assigns a character a name and fits attributes around it . In the case of Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) in his inaugural series of Doctor Who , he chose the name because he considered it a " good luck charm " after he used it for Lesley Sharp 's character in Bob & Rose . He presented his desire to make the show " essentially British " as another justification : he considered Rose to be " the most British name in the world " and feminine enough to subvert the then @-@ current trend of female companions and their " boyish " names , such as Benny , Charley , and Ace . While he was writing for The Grand , the executive producer requested that he change the female lead character 's name , a decision that led to the " character never [ feeling ] right from that moment on " . The surname " Harkness " , most notably given to Torchwood lead Captain Jack Harkness , is a similar charm , first used in 1993 for the Harkness family in Century Falls , and ultimately derived from the Marvel Universe supporting character Agatha Harkness , and the surname " Tyler " is similarly used because of his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced . 
 Davies also attempts to channel his writing by using music that fits the theme of the series as a source of inspiration : Doctor Who was typically written while he listened to action @-@ adventure film scores ; Queer as Folk was written to Hi @-@ NRG music " to catch [ the ] sheer clubland drive " ; Bob & Rose was written to the Moby album Play , because the two works shared an " urban , sexy , full of lonely hearts at night " image ; and The Second Coming shared the concepts of " experimental [ <unk> ] , anguish , dark [ ness ] , [ and ] pain " of Radiohead albums . More specifically , he wrote the early drafts of the fourth series Doctor Who episode " Partners in Crime " while he was listening to Mika 's Life in Cartoon Motion , and singled out the song " Any Other World " as a " Doctor Who companion song " with lyrics that matched Penny , the planned companion for the fourth series . 
 When he creates new scripts , Davies considers the dénouement of a story to be representative of the work . He often formulates both the scene and its emotional impact early in the process , but writes the scenes last due to his belief that " [ later scenes ] can 't exist if they aren 't informed by where they 've come from " . Davies is a strong advocate for the continued use of the cliffhanger ending and opposes advertising that sacrifices the impact of storytelling . In pursuit of his quest , he instructs editors to remove scenes from press copies of episodes he writes ; cliffhangers were removed from the review copies of the Doctor Who episodes " Army of Ghosts " , " The Stolen Earth " , and the first part of The End of Time , and Rose Tyler 's unadvertised appearance in " Partners in Crime " was excised . His most noted cliffhanger was in the script of " The Stolen Earth " , which created a public sense of " Doctor Who fever " in the week preceding its conclusion . In an interview with BBC News shortly after the episode 's transmission , he argued that the success of a popular television series is linked to how well producers can keep secrets and create a " live experience " : 
 It 's exciting when you get kids in playground talking about your story , about who 's going to live or die , then I consider that a job well done , because that 's interactive television , that 's what it 's all about : it 's debate and fun and chat . It 's playing a game with the country and I think that 's wonderful . 
 Davies attempts to both create imagery and to provide a social commentary in his scripts ; for example , he uses camera directions in his scripts more frequently than newer screenwriters to ensure that anyone who reads the script , especially the director , is able to " feel ... the pace , the speed , the atmosphere , the mood , the gags , [ and ] the dread " . His stage directions also create an atmosphere by their formatting and avoidance of the first person . Although the basis of several of his scripts derive from previous concepts , he claims that most concepts for storytelling have been already used , and instead tries to tell a relatively new and entertaining plot ; for example , the Doctor Who episode " Turn Left " shares its concept most notably with the 1998 film Sliding Doors . Like how Sliding Doors examines two timelines based on whether Helen <unk> ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) catches a London Underground train , Davies uses the choice of the Doctor 's companion to turn left or right at a road intersection to depict either a world with the Doctor , as seen throughout the rest of the fourth series , or an alternate world without the Doctor , examined in its entirety within the episode . The world without the Doctor creates a dystopia which he uses to provide a commentary on Nazi @-@ esque fascism . Davies generally tries to make his scripts " quite detailed , but very succinct " , and eschews the long character and set descriptions ; instead , he limits himself to only three adjectives to describe a character and two lines to describe a set to allow the dialogue to describe the story instead . 
 Davies also uses his scripts to examine and debate on large issues such as sexuality and religion , especially from a homosexual or atheist perspective . He refrains from a dependence on " cheap , easy lines " that provide little deeper insight ; his mantra during his early adult drama career was " no boring issues " . Queer as Folk is the primary vehicle for his social commentary of homosexuality and advocation of greater acceptance . He used the series to challenge the " primal ... gut instinct " of homophobia by introducing homosexual imagery in contrast to the heterosexual " fundamental image of life , of family , of childhood , [ and ] of survival " . His next series , Bob & Rose , examined the issue of a gay man who falls in love with a woman , and the reaction of the couple 's respective social circles . Torchwood , in Davies 's own words , is " a very bisexual programme " , and demonstrates a fluid approach to both gender and sexuality " almost from its opening moments " : for example , the lead character Captain Jack Harkness nonchalantly mentions he was once pregnant ; and later , the other lead characters discuss Jack 's sexuality . The gay website AfterElton opined that Torchwood 's biggest breakthrough could be " queer representation " by showing Captain Jack as a character whose bisexuality is explored but not his only character trait . 
 His most notable commentaries of religion and atheism are The Second Coming and his 2007 Doctor Who episode " Gridlock " . The Second Coming 's depiction of a contemporary and realistic Second Coming of Jesus Christ eschews the use of religious iconography in favour of a love story underlined by the male lead 's " awakening as the Son of God " . In contrast , " Gridlock " takes a more pro @-@ active role in debating religion : the episode depicts the unity of the supporting cast in singing the Christian hymns " Abide with Me " and " The Old Rugged Cross " as a positive aspect of faith , but depicts the Doctor as an atheistic hero which shows the faith as misguided because " there is no higher authority " . He also includes his commentary as an undertone in other stories ; he described the sub @-@ plot of the differing belief systems of the Doctor and Queen Victoria in " Tooth and Claw " as a conflict between " Rational Man versus Head of the Church " . 
 Like other scriptwriters during Doctor Who 's original tenure , several of Davies scripts are influenced by his personal politics . Marc Edward DiPaolo of Oklahoma City University observes that Davies usually espouses a " left @-@ leaning " view through his scripts . Beyond religion and sexuality , Davies most notably satirises the United States under George W. Bush on Doctor Who : the Slitheen in " Aliens of London " and " World War Three " and Henry van Statten in " Dalek " were portrayed as sociopathic capitalists ; the Daleks under his tenure echoed contemporary American conservatives in their appearances , from religious fundamentalists in " The Parting of the Ways " to imperialists in " Daleks in Manhattan " and " Evolution of the Daleks " ; and in " The Sound of Drums " , a parody of Bush is murdered by the Master ( John Simm ) , who was presented in the story as a Prime Minister reminiscent of Tony Blair . Other targets of satire in his Doctor Who scripts include Fox News , News Corporation , and the 24 @-@ hour news cycle in " The Long Game " , plastic surgery and consumer culture in " The End of the World " , obesity and alternative medicine in " Partners in Crime " , and racism and paranoia in " Midnight " .

 Saving it from extinction . 
 Davies has received recognition for his work since his career as a children 's television writer . Davies ' first BAFTA award nominations came in 1993 when he was nominated for the " Best Children 's Programme ( Fiction ) " Television Award for his work on Children 's Ward . Children 's Ward was nominated for the Children 's Drama award in 1996 and won the same award 1997 . His next critically successful series was Bob & Rose ; it was nominated for a Television Award for Best Drama Serial and won two British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Drama and Writer of the Year . The Second Coming was nominated for the same Television Award in 2004 . His work on The Second Coming earned him a nomination for a Royal Television Society award . 
 Most of Davies 's recognition came as a result of his work on Doctor Who . In 2005 , Doctor Who won two Television Awards — Best Drama Series and the Pioneer Audience Award — and he was awarded the honorary Dennis Potter Award for writing . He also received that year 's BAFTA Cymru Siân Phillips Award for Outstanding Contribution to Network Television . In 2006 , he was awarded the accolade of " Industry Player of the Year " at the Edinburgh International Television Festival . 
 In 2007 , Davies was nominated for the " Best Soap / Series " Writers ' Guild of Great Britain Award — along with Chris Chibnall , Paul Cornell , Stephen Greenhorn , Steven Moffat , Helen Raynor , and Gareth Roberts — for their work on the third series of Doctor Who . He was again nominated for two BAFTA Awards in 2009 : a Television Award for his work on Doctor Who , and the Television Craft Award for Best Writer , for the episode " Midnight " . Under his tenure , Doctor Who won five consecutive National Television Awards between 2005 and 2010 . He has also been nominated for three Hugo Awards , all in the category of " Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form " : in 2007 , the story comprising " Army of Ghosts " and " Doomsday " was defeated by Steven Moffat 's " The Girl in the Fireplace " ; in 2009 , the episode " Turn Left " was defeated by Joss Whedon 's Dr. Horrible 's Sing @-@ Along Blog ; and in 2010 , all three of his scripts which were eligible for the award , " The Next Doctor " , the Davies – Roberts collaboration " Planet of the Dead " , and the Davies – Ford collaboration " The Waters of Mars " , were nominated : the award was won by " The Waters of Mars " and the other episodes took second and third place . 
 During Davies ' tenure as executive producer , only Steven Moffat 's " Silence in the Library " , which was scheduled against the final of the second series of Britain 's Got Talent , failed to win in its time slot . The show 's viewing figures were consistently high enough that the only broadcasts to have consistently rivalled Doctor Who for viewers in the Broadcasters ' Audience Research Board 's weekly charts were EastEnders , Coronation Street , Britain 's Got Talent , and international football matches . Two of his scripts , " Voyage of the Damned " and " The Stolen Earth " , broke audience records for the show by being declared the second most viewed broadcasts of their respective weeks , and " Journey 's End " became the first episode to be the most viewed broadcast of the week . The show enjoyed consistently high Appreciation Index ratings : " Love & Monsters " , regarded by Doctor Who fans as his worst script , gained a rating of 76 , just short of the 2006 average rating of 77 ; and the episodes " The Stolen Earth " and " Journey 's End " share the highest rating Doctor Who has received , at 91 . 
 Among Doctor Who fans , his contribution to the show ranks as high as the show 's co @-@ creator Verity Lambert : in a 2009 poll of 6 @,@ 700 Doctor Who Magazine readers , he won the " Greatest Contribution " award with 22 @.@ 62 % of the votes against Lambert 's 22 @.@ 49 % share , in addition to winning the magazine 's 2005 , 2006 , and 2008 awards for the best writer of each series . Ian Farrington , who commented on the 2009 " Greatest Contribution " poll , attributed Davies ' popularity to his range of writing styles , from the epic " Doomsday " to the minimalistic " Midnight " , and his ability to market the show to appeal to a wide audience . 
 Davies 's work on Doctor Who has led to accolades out of the television industry . Between 2005 and 2008 , he was included in The Guardian 's " Media 100 " : in 2005 , he was ranked the 14th most influential man in the media ; in 2006 , the 28th ; in 2007 , the 15th ; and in 2008 , the 31st . The Independent on Sunday recognised his contributions to the public by including him on seven consecutive Pink Lists , which chronicle the achievements of gay and lesbian personalities : in 2005 , he was ranked the 73rd most influential gay person ; in 2006 , the 18th ; in 2007 , the most influential gay person ; in 2008 , the 2nd ; in 2009 , the 14th ; in 2010 , the 64th ; in 2011 , the 47th ; in 2012 , the 56th ; and in 2013 , was listed as a permanent member of the List 's " national treasures " . He was awarded an OBE in the Queen 's 2008 Birthday Honours list for services to drama , and an honorary fellowship by Cardiff University in July 2008 .

 = = Plot = = 
 Mayor Adam West deploys the entire Quahog Police Department to Cartagena , Colombia to search for Elaine Wilder ( a fictional character from the film Romancing the Stone which he was watching ) , leaving Joe behind ( as he was not deployed due to his disability and the fact that parts of Cartagena aren 't wheelchair @-@ accessible ) with the police station 's skeleton crew . Peter , Cleveland and Quagmire join the department to assist Joe . 
 Meanwhile , Meg threatens to commit suicide because she does not have a date for her Junior Prom . Even her backup boy turned her down by shooting his little brother and having to attend his funeral . As a last resort , Brian agrees to take her to the prom . He gets drunk there , defends Meg by insulting Connie D 'Amico about her inevitable future , and the two make out . After the dance , Meg begins to think Brian is her boyfriend , despite Brian saying he has no feelings for her and citing his already existing relationship with Jillian . Meg develops an obsession with Brian , even baking him a pie and using her hair as one of the ingredients . Stewie arrives and sits next to Brian and asks if he can have some pie . He then asks for the " Cool <unk> " ( this is the first in a series of occasions where Stewie puts emphasis on the " h " sound in a word starting with " wh " ) . Brian soon works up the courage to tell Lois that he and Meg kissed . Lois gets angry at the news , and orders Brian to dump Meg . 
 Later on , Meg knocks Brian out , puts him in the trunk of his car and drives away . Chris tells Lois that he saw this , so Lois , Peter , Cleveland , Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel . When they arrive , they see Meg has tied Brian up with packaging tape and is about to rape Brian . Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right , although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life . Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs , and then Quagmire says ( in an erotic tone ) " I know what she needs ... Bring her by my house around 8 : 30 tonight I 'll take care of her . " This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire 's house , it seems even more likely ; he tells her to sit down and says " Soon it 'll all become clear " , puts on seductive music , dims the lights , strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her ; but suddenly , Quagmire ( uncharacteristically ) begins to have a serious heart @-@ to @-@ heart talk with Meg , telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day . To help Meg , Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things , and sends her away feeling much better . He then walks into his bedroom , where two of his one @-@ night stands await with an array of sex toys , and it turns out that all of Quagmire 's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst . One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the " <unk> " ( with emphasis on the " h " ) and Quagmire responds with disbelief . 
 During the credits , Tom Tucker reports that the Quahog Police have called off the search for Elaine Wilder and are heading back to Quahog .

 A scene shows Cleveland falling out of the bathtub and subsequently out of his house . This is the second time the show has used this gag ( as indicated when Cleveland comments that " I gotta stop taking baths during Peter 's shenanigans " ) , the first one being " Hell Comes to Quahog " , where Peter blew up Cleveland 's house with a tank . This gag occurred three more times in the seventh season episodes " Tales of a Third Grade Nothing " and " Family Gay " , the season eight episodes " Spies Reminiscent of Us " , " Brian 's Got a Brand New Bag " , and the Cleveland Show pilot . It took several attempts to animate it correctly . The gag of Meg 's Junior Prom date killing his brother in order to escape from their planned date was included in the first draft for the episode , as made by Kirker Butler . 
 A scene featuring Peter , Cleveland , Mort and Quagmire drinking coffee in the booth , waiting for one of them to act irrationally due to Joe adding a substance into their drink , was cut from the broadcast for timing purposes . A deleted scene had been made for the episode , which showed one of the characters present in the booth after Joe added a substance into their drink , turning into a lizard @-@ like creature from Jurassic Park , but the gag was never used . When Brian is explaining the situation with Meg to Lois in the uncensored version he says " this morning she made me eat the hair in her pie " Broadcast standards objected to this and it was changed for air to " hair pie " . On the DVD commentary MacFarlane remarked he thought the latter sounded more offensive . American actor and comedian Garrett Morris guest @-@ starred on the episode , portraying the headmaster of the " New York School for the Hard @-@ of @-@ Hearing " , which was once a regular Weekend Update piece on the 1970s episodes of Saturday Night Live . When Peter and everybody else discover Meg attempting to seduce Brian in the hotel , Peter uses the term " Chinaman " ; this was changed for the television broadcast to " oriental guy " , as " Chinaman " is deemed to be an offensive word . 
 In addition to the regular cast , actress Drew Barrymore , voice actor Barclay DeVeau , voice actor Phil LaMarr , voice actor Kerrigan Mahan , actress Natasha Melnick , comedian and actor Garrett Morris , actress Tamera Mowry and actress Lisa Wilhoit guest starred in the episode . Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan , actress Alex Breckenridge , voice actor John G. Brennan , writer Chris Sheridan , writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener made minor appearances . Recurring guest voice actors Patrick Warburton and Adam West made appearances as well .

 The movie Mayor West is watching on the television is Romancing the Stone . The music played in the background during the black people 's parade is taken almost verbatim from the film adaptation of the 1975 musical The Wiz where , in the final number of the film , they sing " Brand New Day " when it came to the absence of most of the Quahog Police Department . The two songs playing in the background at the junior prom are " Hold On to the Nights " by Richard Marx and " Why " by Annie Lennox . The music used in the background and the academy 's logo when Peter , Quagmire and Cleveland are entering the police training grounds is a reference to that used in the Police Academy . The scene where Meg plays Madame Butterfly while turning the lamp on and off and the line " I will not be ignored , Brian " is a reference to 1987 thriller Fatal Attraction . The entire scene in the hotel where Meg is discovered attempting to seduce Brian is a reference to The King of Comedy , which MacFarlane notes as one of his favorite movies . When Peter Griffin steals a giraffe from the zoo , he names the giraffe Allison Janney . Garrett Morris reprises his role as Headmaster of the New York School for the Hard of Hearing from the first season of Saturday Night Live .

 This episode was written Kirker Butler , who was nominated at the 34th Annie Awards under the category of " Writing in an Animated Television Production " , and Mila Kunis , who voices Meg , was also nominated for her work on this episode under the category of " Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production " . In his review of the episode , Dan Iverson of IGN wrote : " After a couple more episodes like the one that Family Guy had on Sunday night , we could officially and unequivocally call the show the best animated program to air on the weekend " , adding " we are completely willing to raise the once hit @-@ or @-@ miss comedy of Family Guy to the level of most consistently funny comedy on FOX Sunday nights — and that is thanks to great stories and hilarious comedy like that of this week 's episode " Barely Legal . " In a review of Family Guy , Volume five , Nancy Basile regarded " Airport ' 07 " , " Prick Up Your Ears " , and " Barely Legal " as " gem episodes " . Brett Love of TV Squad commented : " It seemed like more of a cohesive story than we have seen in a while as the whole family was tied in to the same storyline " , later adding " I liked the story of Meg 's infatuation with Brian " , concluding with " overall , I 'd call this one a really good episode .

 = Nativity ( Christus ) = 
 The Nativity is a devotional mid @-@ 1450s oil @-@ on @-@ wood panel painting by the Early Netherlandish painter Petrus Christus . It shows a nativity scene with grisaille archways and trompe @-@ l 'œil sculptured reliefs . Christus was influenced by the first generation of Netherlandish artists , especially Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden , and the panel is characteristic of the simplicity and naturalism of art of that period . Placing archways as a framing device is a typical van der Weyden device , and here likely borrowed from that artist 's Altar of Saint John and Miraflores Altarpiece . Yet Christus adapts these painterly motifs to a uniquely mid @-@ 15th century sensibility , and the unusually large panel – perhaps painted as a central altarpiece panel for a triptych – is nuanced and visually complex . It shows his usual harmonious composition and employment of one @-@ point @-@ perspective , especially evident in the geometric forms of the shed 's roof , and his bold use of color . It is one of Christus 's most important works . Max Friedländer definitely attributed the panel to Christus in 1930 , concluding that " in scope and importance , [ it ] is superior to all other known creations of this master . " 
 The overall atmosphere is one of simplicity , serenity and understated sophistication . It is reflective of the 14th @-@ century Devotio Moderna movement , and contains complex Christian symbolism , subtly juxtaposing Old and New Testament iconography . The sculpted figures in the archway depict biblical scenes of sin and punishment , signaling the advent of Christ 's sacrifice , with an over @-@ reaching message of the " Fall and Redemption of humankind " . Inside the archway , surrounded by four angels , is the Holy Family ; beyond , a landscape extends into the far background . 
 Art historians have suggested completion dates ranging from the early 1440s to the early 1460s , with c . 1455 seen as probable . The panel was acquired by Andrew Mellon in the 1930s , and was one of several hundreds from his personal collection donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington . It has suffered damage and was restored in the early 1990s for an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art . 
 = = Description = = 
 The panel measures 127 @.@ 6 cm × 94 @.@ 9 cm ( 50 @.@ 2 in × 37 @.@ 4 in ) , unusually large for a 15th @-@ century Early Netherlandish single @-@ panel painting . It covers four oak boards . Although there is no evidence of missing wing panels , its size suggests it was a central altarpiece of a large triptych . Art historian Joel Upton writes that with its size , style , tone and composition , Christus painted " an <unk> , given monumental , <unk> dimensions " . The distinction between the figures and the space around them is characteristic of Christus , as is its one @-@ point perspective . The background landscape is typically serene , as are what Upton describes as the " charming , almost doll @-@ like figures who make up the cast of characters . " 
 The panel is set in a shed enclosed by two pillars and an archway , rendered in sculpture @-@ like grisaille . Each pillar is supported by a relief hunched figure ( <unk> ) at the base , holding the weight on its shoulders . On each pillar stand statues of Adam and Eve – Adam on the left and Eve to the right . A marble threshold connects the two structures . On the top corners of the arch are two spandrels ; the archivolts contain six biblical scenes in relief from the Book of Genesis , depicting the Fall of Man . Two are of Adam and Eve ; their expulsion from paradise and Adam tilling the soil . The others are of Cain and Abel : their sacrifice to God ; Cain slaying Abel ; God appearing to Abel ; Cain expelled to the Land of Nod . 
 In the shed Mary and Joseph share an intensely private moment before the Annunciation to the shepherds of the Christ child 's birth to the shepherds . They are rendered in bright colors . Mary wears a long flowing blue robe , Joseph a green @-@ lined red cape over a brown robe . He holds his hat in hand , and his pattens are respectfully removed , left lying on the ground . They gaze reverently at the newborn figure of Jesus who lies on Mary 's robe . Mary 's features have a softness and sweetness more characteristic of Christus 's later paintings and remarkably similar to his Madonna of the Dry Tree , according to Maryan Ainsworth . Kneeling in adoration to either side are four small angels . 
 Animals are visible in stalls . Behind them is a crumbling wall with three low Romanesque windows . Four shepherds in contemporary 15th @-@ century clothing are chatting amiably , leaning against the wall , looking into the shed . Two are positioned to the left and two to the right ; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue . Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway , and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center , symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ 's Passion . The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem , a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427 , called the Jerusalem chapel . A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof 's trusses . 
 Light shines into the shed from outside through the low windows . The shadows cast suggest the dawn of a new day . The four onlookers in the rear are in light and shadow , especially noticeable on the face of the man second from the right . Here Christus borrows an optical device from the work of his predecessors Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden , but is bolder and more accomplished with his use of light , which art professor Lola Gellman describes as having " no counterpoint in previous art . " 
 = = Iconography = = 
 The panel is rich in Christian iconography , which reflects the shift in religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century , exemplified by the Devotio Moderna movement . The painting is devotional ; its iconography clearly juxtaposes Old and New Testament imagery , conveying themes of punishment and redemption , against the belief that a second chance is available through the birth of Christ . 
 Depictions of the Nativity changed significantly in European art following St Bridget 's visions of the event . According to Upton , the scene " became a source of emotional reward for one 's faith , a private vision in response to one 's contemplation . " In Bridget 's version of the event , Mary does not lie in a bed while giving birth . The event occurs in a cave , where , dressed in white , Mary kneels or stands in devotion before the infant lying on the ground . Joseph holds a candle to illuminate the birth . Robert Campin 's c . 1420 Nativity is representative of Bridget 's narrative ; the cave has been substituted by a shed with animals , Mary 's handmaidens are present , while angels and shepherds rejoice . Christus simplified the narrative : removing the handmaidens and relegating the animals to the background . Mary 's white dress is replaced with a deep @-@ blue robe . His Nativity is somber and subdued , an embodiment of the " austere calm of timeless worship . " 
 The Nativity conveys both the Old Testament themes of sin and punishment and the New Testament doctrine of sacrifice and redemption . Although Adam and Eve to either side of the arch are suggestive of those in van Eyck 's Ghent Altarpiece , they differ significantly . Here they are painted as grisaille statues in contrast to van Eyck 's lifelike versions ; and , unlike van Eyck 's , here Adam and Eve stand in shame hiding their nudity . Earthly sin and strife , anger and revenge , are represented in the warriors in the corner spandrels , and signify that which Christ 's birth would bring to an end . 
 Themes of punishment and redemption are further explored in the six scenes on the arch , where the reliefs show the events from Genesis 4 : 1 – 16 ( from left to right ) : The angel of God expelling Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden ; post @-@ Expulsion life " when Adam delved and Eve spun " ; the sacrifices of Cain and Abel ; Cain killing Abel ; ( top ) God banishing Cain ; Cain saying farewell to his parents , or possibly his brother Seth leaving to find the Tree of Life , a Jewish legend from The Apocalypse of Moses , a <unk> work from antiquity . 
 The two uppermost reliefs on the arch , which have a central focus and function as keystones , bring attention to the juxtaposition of Old and New Testament themes . The relief to the left shows Cain and Abel sacrificing to God ; on the right Cain commits the sin of murder , which God punishes . The two reliefs also function as a temporal device , leading the viewer directly to the moment of Christ 's birth and mankind 's redemption , which occurs below in the shed . The viewer is reminded that mankind must sacrifice to Christ , who lies directly below , or risk punishment and expulsion from the church , just as God expelled Cain . The Fall of man acted out on the archway reminds the viewer of the " necessity of Christ 's sacrifice " . 
 The semicircle of rock inside the <unk> remind the viewer to abandon sin . The viewer is reminded to reach a full understanding of the significance of the event , achieved with the two groupings of shepherds at the rear of the shed . Two of the four are active and two are passive . The man dressed in blue on the left is listening ; the man in blue to the right is seeing , while their counterparts in red do neither . Although actively looking and listening , the two men in blue do not appear to have a full understanding of the event . Upton explains the medieval viewer would have understood that in the iconography Christus presented " man who would listen without hearing , and look without seeing . " The viewer is reminded to comprehend the painting 's vision and iconography , to fully recognize the significance of Christ 's coming , to hear and see the word of God , and to obey God 's wishes . 
 The tuft of grass sprouting from the roof 's central truss above the figures conveys multiple meanings . Although the shrub is naturally rendered , Christus almost certainly placed it there for its symbolic value ; its positioning suggests he followed a program of disguised iconography . The most obvious meaning is of new life and new beginnings . On a secular level , the shrub may have indicated Christus 's membership in the Confraternity of the Dry Tree , which he joined sometime around 1462 – 63 . The confraternity was prestigious , including among its ranks Burgundian nobility , such as Philip the Good and his wife Isabella , wealthy foreign merchants and members from Bruges 's upper classes . The tuft of grass also symbolizes the tree of life , and Upton theorizes that by placing it there , Christus " has given expression to the legend " of Adam 's third son , Seth , whose quest for a branch was a popular legend in the medieval period . Furthermore , alludes to Moses and the burning bush . According to Upton , in Christus 's Nativity Joseph assumes Moses 's role of protector and law @-@ bringer ; just as Joseph has removed his pattens in the presence of Christ , Moses removed his shoes in the presence of the bush . 
 The setting represents the Mass – the angels are clothed in Eucharistic vestments , with those on the far right dressed in a deacon 's cope . None wear the celebrant 's chasuble , suggesting Christ is the priest . The shed roof is a ciborium over an altar . A later addition to the painting , added perhaps in the 17th century , and since removed , was a gold paten on which the infant lay , clearly showing Jesus as the Eucharistic host . Mary , Joseph and the angels are the first to worship the infant Christ and the shed " becomes the altar of the first mass " . Upton explains that when viewed in the context of the first mass the iconography is more clearly defined . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Christus was the first Netherlandish painter to achieve proficiency in strict mathematical compositional rules with his use of orthogonals , creating a unified perspective . The concept of compositions " based on unitary perspective " was largely a pioneering effort on Christus 's part , although he borrowed from the earlier masters . Compositionally , the Nativity is one of Christus 's most complex and important works , which Ainsworth says is masterfully integrated with the use of color . X @-@ radiography reveals sketched orthogonal lines on the underpainting , used to indicate where the horizontal and vertical axis should meet at the main figures ' heads , and that he used a compass to sketch the spandrels . 
 The painting contains several geometric constructions . The roof of the shed 's trusses form series of triangles connecting lines joining the base of the pedestals and the crossbeams . These surround the gathering of the Holy Family , who form an inverse pattern . According to art historian Lawrence <unk> , " the detail participates in an almost emblematic pattern of repeated triangles which establish a rhyme scheme above and below , of roof structure and figure disposition . " Upton writes that a " clearly defined diamond " is visible within the apex in the roof . From there it extends down to Eve , and the bottom apex is formed where the infant lies on the ground . It then extends up to Adam and back up to the roof . " This diamond shape , " he writes , " supplemented by the rectangle within it , formed by the shed supports , the base of the triangle and the ground line in the shed , circumscribes the main event of the painting . " 
 Spatial and temporal borders separating the earthly and heavenly spheres are often seen in Netherlandish art , usually in the form of frames or arches . A boundary is achieved here with the grisaille archway , strongly reminiscent of van der Weyden 's work . Art historians speculate Christus may have imitated his c . 1455 Altar of Saint John . Instead of merely imitating , Christus innovated and extended the use of van der Weyden 's arch motif ; his arch is meant to be an opening , or a screen , for the viewer to see into the holy space , instead of a simple framing device in which figures are placed directly in @-@ line or under the arch . The multi @-@ hued threshold stones at the bottom emphasize its function says Upton , who writes : " it is an opening through which one passes : a true frame or doorway to the picture ... Yet , since this arch is painted in grisaille , distinct from the rest of the panel , it must also be seen as a separate entity , much like an elaborate border around an illuminated manuscript page . " The shadows cast by the grisaille figures stress " its function as a diaphragm between real and illusory space " . 
 A very similar archway is found in Dieric Bouts 's c . 1445 Mary Altarpiece , including spandrels with warriors . Art historians are unsure which was painted earlier – Christus 's Nativity or Bouts 's altarpiece . Equally , van der Weyden 's arched triptychs were executed at roughly the same period , but art historians are more certain Rogier 's archivolt design set the precedent . Unlike Bouts and van der Weyden , Christus appears to have used the device to encompass a single scene , incorporating all the main characters within the arch , instead of a linked series of scenes with separate archways . 
 The arch is only a prelude to the complex divisions beyond . The space inhabited by the Holy Family is holy ground . Mary , Joseph , the Christ child and the four surrounding angels occupy a space partitioned in the front by the archway and by the wall at the rear . A semicircle of figures is positioned around Christ , echoed in the semicircle of rocks placed directly inside the <unk> . Mary and Joseph are echoed by the colorful vertical porphyry columns on the sides , and by the statues of Adam and Eve . The rear of the shed where the four men stand , the small valley with the shepherds , the town , and the background landscape are also spatially discrete areas , which create a " steady , measured movement into space in place of the more abrupt jumping from foreground to distant background common to Flemish painting . " They also function to surround the Holy Family while simultaneously preventing its isolation from the world . Ainsworth writes that the " message of the painting quietly emerges from the strict , <unk> correct space constructed to engage the viewer . " Upton agrees , explaining that the use of geometric devices emphasize the focal point , which " falls well below the horizon in the exact center of the panel " , a perspective that would have given the 15th center viewer , kneeling in front of the panel , a " sense of physical relationship between the actual and ideal act of worship . " 
 = = Dating and condition = = 
 The Nativity 's dating has long been a source of debate among scholars . Estimations range from the mid @-@ 1440s to the mid @-@ 1450s ; early in Christus 's career to about the time van der Weyden painted his c . 1455 Altar of St John . Generally the mid @-@ 1450s seems the most accepted . Ainsworth considers it , along with Christus 's Holy Family ( currently in Kansas City ) , one of the most important attributed to him and believes it belongs in his later oeuvre , possibly as late as the mid @-@ 1460s . Evidence such as when Christus joined the Confraternity of the Dry Tree ( c. early 1460s ) points to it as a later work along with the Portrait of a Young Girl . Its use of perspective and assimilation of van Eyck 's and van der Weyden 's earlier influences also suggest a later date . Furthermore , the softer facial types utilized in the Nativity are typical of Christus 's later work , and suggest a date around the mid @-@ 1450s . Technical analysis ( dendrochronological evidence ) suggests a date of c . 1458 , based on the tree felling date . Christus painted two other versions of the Nativity : one in Bruges and the other in Berlin . The Bruges Nativity is dated 1452 – whether the date was added by Christus or during a restoration is unknown – and technical analysis of the brushstrokes suggests it to be earlier than the Washington Nativity . 
 Determining the execution date relies on stylistic analysis , and the degree of van der Weyden 's influence . The dating of the work to the 1440s is based on the notion that Christus borrowed heavily from the immediate influence of van der Weyden and Bouts . Although some of the similarities are undeniably striking and might be attributed to following a template , the degree of sophistication in the Nativity far surpasses the other two painters , according to Ainsworth . She writes that Bouts and van der Weyden " merely expand the narrative " in their use of the archway motif , whereas Christus shows a strong cause and effect between sin and redemption , innovations which almost certainly evolved later in his career , placing the date no earlier than the mid @-@ 1450s . 
 The underdrawing is visible through modern technical analysis , revealing the main group of figures and contour lines in the folds and drape of the clothing . The angels ' wings to Mary 's left are visible , but not those to the right , probably because of later overpainting . In the underdrawing Mary 's gown extends far to the left of the angel , but Christus apparently changed his mind about its execution . 
 The work has suffered damage : cracking where three wood panels are joined , paint loss to parts of the crackle pattern , and discoloration of varnishes . The largest area of paint loss occurred on Joseph 's shoulder . Mary 's robe has been completely restored and overpainted . Some paint loss is barely discernible in the areas around her hair . In many areas the paint layers and underlying support are in good condition . 
 The Nativity was one of 13 works hung at the Metropolitan Museum of Art 's 1994 exhibition , " Petrus Christus : Renaissance Master of Bruges " . It underwent significant restoration in preparation . Technicians removed over @-@ paint probably dating to its Spanish provenance . The addition included the gold paten on Mary 's robe , pigment under the Christ child , and the halos above Mary and Jesus . As early as 1916 , Friedländer questioned the presence of halos in Christus 's work , rarely seen in mid @-@ 15th century Netherlandish painting . When the halos were carefully examined they were found to be later additions ; before the exhibition they were removed from several paintings , including the Portrait of a Carthusian . 
 = = Provenance = = 
 The painting is today in the National Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. , which was conceived by Pittsburgh financier Andrew Mellon in the late 1930s . It was one of 126 paintings from his personal collection donated to the gallery and was on display at the museum opening in March 1941 – three years after his death . 
 It belonged to Señora O. <unk> of Madrid , who sold it in 1930 to Franz M. <unk> , founder of the Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin . That April , the Duveen Brothers , less affected by the 1929 stock market crash than other dealers , paid <unk> £ 30 @,@ 000 , in cash , for the painting and sold it immediately to Mellon . A dealer usually had to go through the lengthy process of sending photographs of a painting via trans @-@ Atlantic ship to an American buyer and then wait for a reply ; the transaction for the Nativity is exceptional because it is the first painting of which the photograph was wired via Marconi cable from England to America . To avoid the export fees due if the painting been sent directly to New York , the <unk> took a circuitous route – from Madrid to Germany , then to Paris and America . In 1936 it was acquired by the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust , and gifted to the National Gallery a year later . 
 Given its size and orientation , the panel was probably meant to stand alone , but may have been conceived as the wing of triptych altarpiece . Who commissioned the piece or how it came to be in the possession of a Spanish owner is unknown . At least half of Christus 's known patrons were Italian or Spanish , and he often changed his style to suit their desire . Around eight of his paintings – only about 25 are extant – have come from either Italy or Spain , giving credence to speculation that he spent time there . Yet the existence of the thriving export market in early Netherlandish panel painting suggests equally that it could have been painted in Bruges and transported south . 
 = Odell Waller = 
 Odell Waller ( 1917 – July 2 , 1942 ) was an African American sharecropper from Gretna , Virginia executed for the fatal shooting of his white landlord , Oscar Wheldon Davis , on July 15 , 1940 . Waller unsuccessfully maintained at his trial that the killing had been in self @-@ defense , but was convicted of a jury of white citizens who had paid the poll tax , a measure that effectively barred blacks and poor whites from jury service . 
 The Workers ' Defense League , a socialist labor rights organization , began a national campaign calling for the commutation of Waller 's sentence , and was supported in its efforts by novelist Pearl S. Buck , philosopher John Dewey , and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt . President Franklin D. Roosevelt also made a private appeal on Waller 's behalf to Virginia Governor Colgate Darden . Though the campaign won several postponements of the sentence , Waller was finally executed on July 2 , 1942 . The case failed to overturn the poll tax , but led to reform of Virginia 's penal system and motivated Pauli Murray to begin her career in civil rights law . 
 = = Killing of Oscar Davis = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Odell Waller was born in 1917 to Dollie Jones and an unknown father , who died shortly after his birth . Jones gave the boy to her sister Annie Waller and Annie 's husband , Willis Waller , to adopt , and Odell considered Annie his mother . Odell completed three years of high school , but was later forced to leave school to work on the farm . From 1935 to 1938 , he was convicted of seven offenses , including assault , reckless driving , bootlegging , and carrying a concealed razor . In January 1939 , he married a woman named Mollie . 
 During the Great Depression , the Wallers fell behind on the mortgage for their farm , and after Willis died in 1938 , the bank foreclosed . Annie and Odell then agreed to become sharecroppers for a white landlord , Oscar Davis . The relationship quickly soured . Davis was also a sharecropper , and when his own landlord reduced Davis ' land allotment , Davis reduced that of the Wallers to only 2 acres ( 0 @.@ 81 ha ; 0 @.@ 0031 sq mi ) . The Wallers accused Davis of failing to pay Annie an agreed $ 7 @.@ 50 for taking care of Davis ' ill wife for three weeks ; when the Wallers subsequently refused to work in Davis ' fields , Davis evicted them . Following the eviction , someone on the Davis farm mutilated one of the Wallers ' dogs . After Annie 's cousin Robert helped her harvest the farm 's wheat , Davis took the whole crop rather than give the Wallers their share . In April 1940 , Odell had taken a job constructing electrical lines in Maryland , but he returned on the weekend of July 13 – 14 to investigate the worsening situation .

 At 6 : 30 AM on July 15 , 1940 , Odell drove to Davis 's farm to get the wheat with Annie , relatives Archie Waller and Thomas Younger , and a friend named Buck Fitzgerald . He brought a .32 caliber pistol . 
 The subsequent events remain in dispute . Henry Davis , a teenage black employee of Oscar Davis , maintained that Odell Waller had fired at Oscar Davis without provocation or warning , hitting him four times . Oscar Davis 's sons testified that their father had stated before he died that Waller had shot him without cause . One son added that Davis had said Waller had continued to shoot after Davis had already fallen to the ground . The testimony of other witnesses , including Waller 's relatives , was inconclusive , as they were too distant to hear the conversation between Waller and Davis . Waller stated that Davis had refused to let him take the Waller family share of the wheat , and had reached for his pocket as if to draw a gun ; Waller then fired on Davis . 
 Davis escaped through the cornfield after being shot and was taken to the hospital , where he died of his wounds on July 17 . Afraid he would be lynched , Waller fled to Columbus , Ohio , but was arrested there at the home of an uncle on July 24 after a manhunt involving police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation . 
 = = Trial = = 
 During Waller 's trial , which began on September 19 , 1940 , he was represented by Thomas H. Stone of the small communist splinter organization Revolutionary Workers League ( RWL ) . The RWL 's members had been expelled from the Communist Party USA in 1934 for their Trotskyist beliefs , and the organization was unpopular due to its opposition to World War II . The group compared the trial to that of the Scottsboro Boys , nine African @-@ American young men accused of rape in Alabama under suspicious circumstances , and began to criticize the racism and economic conditions of Waller 's rural Virginia county . Historian Richard B. Sherman argues that the group brought negative publicity to Waller 's trial from the start by creating the perception that " radical outsiders " were behind his defense . A socialist labor rights organization , the Workers ' Defense League ( WDL ) , offered to take over the defense and public campaign to avoid the stigma of communism from influencing Waller 's case , but was rebuffed by the RWL . 
 Stone and another defense attorney , J. Byron Hopkins , were given only three days to prepare Waller 's defense . After an all @-@ white jury was selected , composed only of citizens that could pay the poll tax , Stone moved that the case be dismissed on the grounds that Waller was " deprived of a trial by a jury of his peers " . However , Stone failed to submit evidence that this was the case , a factor that would prove crucial in later unsuccessful appeals . The judge dismissed the motion , as well as a tactically questionable motion by Stone that the judge himself was prejudiced in the case and should withdraw . 
 The testimony of Henry Davis and Oscar Davis 's sons proved damning , and several witnesses also testified that they had heard Waller declare he would come home with his wheat or kill Oscar Davis . In an analysis of the transcript , Sherman proposes that the phrasing of these witnesses was so similar that they may have been coached by prosecutors , but the defense counsel did not pursue this possibility . On September 27 , 1940 , after less than an hour 's deliberation , the jury found Waller guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death , a verdict praised by the Virginia press covering the trial . His execution was scheduled for December 27 of that year . 
 = = Campaign for commutation = = 
 After the trial , the RWL agreed to pass responsibility for the public campaign and legal appeals to the WDL , provided that the case continue to be handled " on a class struggle basis " , with attention to national issues as well as Waller 's specific situation . Eager to help Waller , the WDL reluctantly agreed to the terms . The organization assumed control of the case in November 1940 and immediately began fundraising on Waller 's behalf . Pauli Murray , a young woman new to the organization , was dispatched on a national fundraising tour , accompanied at times by Annie Waller . 
 The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) joined the case the same month , as did the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters , giving the case national publicity . The groups hoped that the case would lead the US Supreme Court to rule that the poll tax was unconstitutional . In December , Virginia Governor James H. Price granted Waller his first stay of execution , this one for three months , giving the new defense additional time to study the case . 
 On March 28 , 1941 , philosopher John Dewey joined the cause , sending Murray $ 5 @.@ 00 for Waller 's defense and giving permission to use his name in further fundraising . Dewey later co @-@ signed an open letter comparing Waller to Dred Scott , a slave who had unsuccessfully sued for his freedom before the US Supreme Court . One of Dewey 's letters to the New York Times about the case caught the attention of Nobel Prize for Literature laureate Pearl S. Buck , who also became involved in the case . She wrote in an open letter of her own that Waller " has ceased to be an individual , he has become a personification of all those to whom democracy is denied in our country " . 
 US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt also worked on Waller 's behalf . Historian Richard B. Sherman states that she became involved after receiving a letter from Murray , which prompted her to write Governor Price requesting that he investigate whether Waller had received a fair trial and delay the execution . Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin , in contrast , holds that the First Lady intervened after receiving a handwritten note from Waller himself saying " I have heard lots of people speak of what a nice lady you are and what I can hear is that you believe in helping the poor ... Please write to the Governor and get him to have mercy on me and allow me a chance . " Whatever its beginnings , Roosevelt 's involvement in the case caused her to be widely criticized in the white Southern press . 
 = = Execution = = 
 On June 1 , 1942 , the US Supreme Court denied two of Waller 's petitions for appeal , and the defense was soon left without further legal options . In a final attempt to win a pardon or commutation from the governor , activists staged events around the country , including a two @-@ hour blackout of the lights in the primarily African @-@ American neighborhood of Harlem in New York City . Governor Price 's successor , Colgate Darden , received over seventeen thousand letters about the case . 
 On the eve of Waller 's execution , Eleanor Roosevelt appealed to her husband , President Franklin D. Roosevelt ; Franklin agreed , sending a private letter to Darden urging that the sentence be commuted to life imprisonment , signing it , " an old friend who just happens to be president " . Darden held a ten @-@ hour clemency hearing and , after hearing arguments from both sides , decided to proceed with the execution . Pauli Murray , the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters ' A. Philip Randolph , and the NAACP 's Walter White traveled to Washington in an attempt to lobby the president personally , unaware that he had already secretly appealed on their behalf . The president 's apparent refusal to act damaged his relationship with civil rights leaders ; Murray , in an open letter on behalf of the movement , called it a " stab in the back " . Murray and Eleanor Roosevelt , however , would remain friends until the latter 's death two decades later . 
 Waller wrote a ten @-@ page " Dying Statement " before his execution , admitting he had made mistakes but insisting that he had acted in self @-@ defense : 
 I haven 't lived so upright and I have asked God to forgive me and I feel he has ... I accidentally fell and some good people tried to help me ... In my case I worked hard from sun up to sun down trying to make a living for my family and it ended up in death for me . You take big people , as the presidents , governors , judges , their children don 't never have to suffer , they has plenty money . Born in a mention nothing ever to worry about . I am glad that some people are lucky . The penitentiary all over the United States are full of people ho was pore tried to work and have something , and couldn 't so that maid them steel and rob . 
 He was executed by electric chair on the morning of July 2 , 1942 . At the time of his execution , Waller had been on death row for 630 days , then the longest death row stay in the state 's history . His funeral was held on July 5 and was attended by 2 @,@ 500 people . Only one white person , WDL Secretary Morris Milgram , attended . Other whites had been asked not to come ; a reporter wrote of the exclusion that " [ the black community ] did not want ' Odell Waller 's murderers ' to look on his face in death " . 
 = = Impact of the case = = 
 Despite the uproar over the poll tax as a factor in jury selection , the tax remained in Virginia until the ratification of the Twenty @-@ fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964 . Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career in civil rights law . Governor Darden , influenced by the popular sentiment that the case had evoked , began a reform of the Virginia penal system , including the creation of an official Pardon and Parole Board with the authority to commute sentences . 
 = U.S. Route 4 in New York = 
 U.S. Route 4 ( US 4 ) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from East Greenbush , New York , to Portsmouth , New Hampshire . In the U.S. state of New York , US 4 extends 79 @.@ 75 miles ( 128 @.@ 35 km ) from an intersection with US 9 and US 20 in East Greenbush to the Vermont state line northeast of Whitehall . While the remainder of US 4 east of New York is an east – west route , US 4 in New York is signed north – south due to the alignment the route takes through the state . The portion of the route between Waterford and Whitehall is part of the Lakes to Locks Passage , an All @-@ American Road . 
 The route runs along the Hudson River from Troy to Hudson Falls and the Champlain Canal from Fort Ann to Whitehall . It passes through several riverside and canalside communities , including two cities ( Troy and Mechanicville ) and seven villages . US 4 crosses several major east – west highways as it proceeds north , such as Interstate 90 ( I @-@ 90 ) in East Greenbush , New York State Route 7 ( NY 7 ) in Troy , NY 29 in Schuylerville , and NY 149 in Fort Ann . It also overlaps with the north – south NY 22 for 6 miles ( 10 km ) from Comstock to Whitehall and with NY 32 for a total of 16 miles ( 26 km ) between Waterford and Bemis Heights and from Schuylerville to Northumberland . 
 US 4 was assigned in 1926 and initially extended from Glens Falls to the Vermont border near Whitehall by way of Hudson Falls . The route utilized part of NY 6 and NY 30 , two highways assigned in 1924 . US 4 was extended southward to its present terminus in East Greenbush as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . Much of US 4 south of Hudson Falls initially overlapped with other routes ; most of the overlaps were gradually eliminated during the 1940s and 1950s as the concurrent routes were eliminated or truncated . At one time , US 4 overlapped with NY 32 from Waterford to Northumberland with no interruption in between . The concurrency was split into two shorter overlaps when US 4 was realigned in the 1950s to follow its current alignment between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The portion of US 4 between NY 32 in Waterford and NY 22 in Whitehall is the southernmost part of the Lakes to Locks Passage , an All @-@ American Road that begins in Waterford and heads north through eastern New York to Rouses Point . Additionally , the segment of US 4 between the northern city line of Mechanicville and the eastern village line of Whitehall is designated as the Turning Point Trail . 
 Most of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) ; however , two sections are maintained by local highway departments . The first lies within the city of Troy , where US 4 is completely city @-@ maintained . The other is in the city of Mechanicville , where local maintenance extends from Frances Street ( four blocks south of NY 67 ) to the northern city line . 
 = = = East Greenbush to Schuylerville = = = 
 US 4 begins at the concurrency of US 9 and US 20 in East Greenbush . Heading northward , it has an interchange with I @-@ 90 , continuing northward into Troy . In Troy , it passes by Hudson Valley Community College as well as the headquarters of the 42nd Infantry Division . US 4 then heads downhill , passing the historic South End Tavern as Burden Avenue , named for the historic Burden Iron Works . Later , US 4 assumes Fourth Street , which splits into parallel one @-@ way streets ( Third Street handles southbound traffic from downtown ) . At Congress Street , in the middle of the Central Troy Historic District with St. Paul 's Episcopal Church on the corner , it intersects NY 2 . Once through downtown , the streets meet and pass by the Green Island Bridge , later passing under the Collar City Bridge and onto Second Avenue in Lansingburgh . 
 After Lansingburgh , US 4 turns left to cross the Hudson River on the Troy – Waterford Bridge , entering Waterford , joining with NY 32 to head north together west of the Hudson . They run along the riverbank for 7 miles ( 11 km ) to the city of Mechanicville , where the routes cross over Anthony Kill and intersect NY 67 in the central business district . US 4 and NY 32 continue on , passing through the nearby village of Stillwater before splitting at Bemis Heights , a small community 5 miles ( 8 km ) northeast of Mechanicville . While NY 32 follows a more inland routing along the western edge of Saratoga National Historical Park , US 4 continues to follow the riverbank , running along the eastern boundary of the park . Past the park , the route passes by the Saratoga National Cemetery before rejoining NY 32 at the southern edge of the village of Schuylerville . 
 = = = Schuylerville to Vermont line = = = 
 US 4 begins to run along the Champlain Canal after Schuylerville , passing through the hamlets of Northumberland and Starks Knob . At a crossing over the Hudson River , US 4 and the concurrent NY 32 split in different directions . US 4 , which is now on the other side of the Hudson , continues northward through Fort Miller , and crosses the River once more . The route then enters Fort Edward , where it becomes concurrent with NY 197 . 
 With the Hudson River to its west , US 4 heads northward once again , leaving NY 197 behind . Not far after Fort Edward , the highway enters Hudson Falls , where it turns into a local road . There , it heads through downtown , intersecting with NY 196 , and soon afterwards , NY 254 . US 4 makes a sudden curve to the northeast , heading through the rural regions for the rest of its length . 
 There is one final intersection with NY 32 , but they do not become concurrent and US 4 heads to the northeast . The route passes through Kingsbury and soon after , becomes concurrent with NY 149 . The two routes head into Fort Ann , where they split , with NY 149 heading westward . After passing Battle Hill , NY 22 merges in from Comstock . There are several hills before the intersection where the two roads split in Whitehall . US 4 continues along its final stretch after NY 22 , passing fields and such to the state line , where it continues into Vermont .

 = = = Origins and assignment = = = 
 In 1911 , the New York State Legislature created Route 43 , an unsigned legislative route extending from the southern village line of Stillwater to the western village line of Schuylerville via the hamlet of Quaker Springs . On March 1 , 1921 , Route 43 was renumbered to Route 44 to eliminate numerical duplication with another legislative Route 43 in western New York . At the same time , Route 44 was extended southwest from Stillwater to Clifton Park via Mechanicville and west from Schuylerville to Saratoga Springs . 
 The first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 . Two of the routes assigned at this time were NY 6 , a north – south route extending from the New York City line to the Canadian border , and NY 30 , another north – south route connecting NY 6 in Mechanicville to the Vermont state line west of Fair Haven . NY 6 left Albany on modern NY 32 and followed it to Mechanicville , where NY 6 veered westward on what is now NY 67 and NY 30 picked up the current alignment of NY 32 . NY 30 continued north on modern NY 32 to Glens Falls , at which point it went east to Hudson Falls via Warren and River streets . It headed northward from there to Vermont on modern US 4 . From Mechanicville to Schuylerville , NY 30 utilized the alignment of legislative Route 44 . By 1926 , NY 30 was rerouted north of Whitehall to continue north toward the Canadian border . The old alignment of NY 30 between Whitehall and Vermont was not assigned a new number . Meanwhile , an alternate route of NY 6 on the east side of the Hudson River between NY 5 ( now US 20 ) in East Greenbush and NY 6 in Waterford was designated as NY 6B by 1926 . 
 In the original plans for the U.S. Highway System , the north – south highway along the western bank of the Hudson River was designated as US 9 while the highway on the eastern bank was assigned US 109 . The two routes were concurrent from Albany to Mechanicville , where US 9 went west to follow NY 6 while US 109 continued north on NY 30 . The designations met again south of Glens Falls , where US 109 ended at US 9 . Also in the original plans was US 4 , which was assigned to all of NY 30 's original alignment between Glens Falls and the Vermont state line . In the final system alignment approved on November 11 , 1926 , the routing of US 9 was altered to follow its modern alignment between Albany and Glens Falls while US 109 was reconfigured to use NY 6B between East Greenbush and Waterford . 
 = = = Southward extension and overlaps = = = 
 When U.S. Highways were first posted in New York in 1927 , US 9 was restored to its originally planned alignment between Albany and Glens Falls ( via Waterford and Mechanicville ) while the US 109 designation went unassigned . The portion of US 109 's alignment south of Waterford became US 9E instead . US 4 was assigned as planned in 1926 , overlapping NY 30 between Glens Falls and Whitehall . The NY 6 designation was completely removed at this time . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , US 9 was realigned to follow its modern routing between Albany and Round Lake . The portion of US 9 's former routing between Waterford and Mechanicville as well as all of US 9E north of US 20 became a southward extension of US 4 , which left its original alignment in Hudson Falls and followed a previously unnumbered riverside highway south to Northumberland . In between Northumberland and Mechanicville , it utilized the former routing of NY 30 , which was reassigned to another highway as part of the renumbering . 
 Virtually all of US 4 south of Hudson Falls initially overlapped other routes , all of which were assigned as part of the renumbering . In between Hudson Falls and Northumberland , US 4 overlapped NY 32B , which began in Glens Falls and followed US 4 's former routing east to Hudson Falls . From Northumberland to Schuylerville and from Bemis Heights to Waterford , US 4 was part of NY 32 . The segment from Schuylerville to Bemis Heights was designated NY 32A . Lastly , the part of US 4 south of Northern Drive ( then @-@ NY 40 ) in Troy was concurrent to NY 40 . By 1932 , NY 40 was rerouted through Troy to follow a more easterly alignment through the city . The realignment moved the northern end of the overlap southward to the junction of US 4 and Winter Street in North Greenbush . 
 Most of the overlaps were eliminated as time went on . In the early 1940s , NY 32A was reassigned to another highway in the Catskill Mountains while NY 32B was truncated to end in Hudson Falls . The former routing of NY 32A became a realignment of NY 32 , creating an uninterrupted overlap between US 4 and NY 32 from Waterford to Northumberland . In the mid @-@ 1950s , work began on a project to upgrade a pre @-@ existing riverside highway between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville . The project was completed by 1958 , at which time the roadway became part of a realigned US 4 . The overlap with NY 40 was eliminated in the late 1950s when NY 40 was truncated to begin at the junction of US 4 and Winter Street .

 = Haim ( band ) = 
 Haim ( pronounced HY @-@ əm , / <unk> / , Hebrew : <unk> Life and stylized as <unk> ) is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles . The band consists of sisters Este , Danielle and Alana Haim , and drummer Dash Hutton . The group 's pop sound on their studio work stands in contrast to the more rock @-@ based music of their live shows . 
 The sisters grew up in a musical family , and began playing instruments from an early age in cover bands with their parents . They began performing as Haim in 2007 , but did not seriously consider a professional career for some years . Este graduated with a degree in <unk> , while Danielle became a successful touring guitarist with Jenny Lewis and The Strokes ' frontman , Julian Casablancas , on his solo tours . This led to Haim resuming as a full @-@ time operation in 2012 . 
 The group 's first release , Forever ( an EP released on a limited @-@ time download ) , combined with positive reception at the South by Southwest festival , led to a deal with Polydor Records and a management deal with Jay Z 's Roc Nation group in mid @-@ 2012 . The band began recording material for their first album , Days Are Gone , in between touring , including appearances at the Glastonbury Festival . The album charted in the top ten in several countries , including the number one @-@ spot in the UK , and the group had won several " best of " awards by the end of 2013 . The group was nominated for Best New Artist at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards and is recording a second album .

 The three sisters , Este Arielle Haim ( b . March 14 , 1986 ) , Danielle Sari Haim ( b . February 16 , 1989 ) and Alana Mychal Haim ( b . December 15 , 1991 ) were born and raised in the San Fernando Valley , California . Their father Mordechai ( " Moti " ) was born in Israel and is of Bulgarian Jewish descent , while their mother Donna is of Polish descent . Both have been musicians ; though he had been a professional soccer player in Israel , Moti also played drums , while Donna won a contest on The Gong Show in the 1970s singing a Bonnie Raitt song . While Danielle showed an aptitude for the guitar at a young age , Moti made the decision that Este would be more suited to the bass , buying her a second hand Fender for $ 50 . The siblings were encouraged to listen to their parents ' 1970s classic rock and Americana records and , during their childhood , the family formed a band called <unk> to play cover versions at local charity fairs , with Moti on drums and Donna on guitar . The group played typical wedding band material , including the Beatles ' " Get Back " , Billy Joel 's " You May Be Right " and Van Morrison 's " Brown Eyed Girl " , but only did free community and benefit gigs at churches , schools and hospitals . 
 Danielle and Este were members of the pop @-@ rock group the Valli Girls , and appeared on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants . Their song " Valli Nation " by the " SoCal teen prodigies " appeared on the 2005 Nickelodeon Kids ' Choice Awards soundtrack alongside established musicians Avril Lavigne , Alicia Keys , Simple Plan and Good Charlotte . 
 As they grew older , the sisters became more interested in incorporating pop and contemporary R & B into their music , and in 2007 they decided to form their own band . For their first gig , the trio played at a Jewish deli in Hollywood and were paid in matzah ball soup . Early gigs were sparsely populated ; Danielle recalled " we were bottom of the bill at 50 capacity venues and no @-@ one would show up " . 
 For the next five years , Haim played local venues but did not consider music as a professional career , since all three sisters were busy with other projects . Este was studying at UCLA and graduated in 2010 with a degree in <unk> ( completed in just two years instead of the normal five ) , specializing in Bulgarian and Brazilian music .

 After graduating from high school , Danielle was spotted by musician Jenny Lewis at a jam session in Laurel Canyon , which led to Danielle joining Lewis ' touring band . The Strokes ' singer Julian Casablancas came to see one of Lewis 's shows on tour , and he in turn asked Danielle to play guitar and percussion on his own solo tour . Danielle rehearsed with Casablancas ' band every day for two months , which she later described as " an eye @-@ opening experience " . Following working with Casablancas , she toured as part of Scarlet Fever , the all @-@ female backing band for CeeLo Green . 
 While Danielle enjoyed touring , she decided she would prefer to perform her own music alongside her sisters , turning down a lucrative tour deal with Green . Casablancas advised Danielle to write stronger material and focus on recording , as it would improve their online presence .

 After playing shows supporting Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros , The Henry Clay People and Kesha , Haim released the three song EP Forever in February 2012 as a time @-@ limited free download on their website . Dash Hutton officially joined as drummer at the EP 's release party at the Los Angeles Bootleg Theatre . He is the son of Three Dog Night 's Danny Hutton and knew Este socially after she had seen his old band , Wires on Fire . The EP received attention from the music industry following a successful series of shows at the South by Southwest festival in March . Danielle recalled the first show was " maybe a disaster " , but the remainder of the shows attracted more attention . The band subsequently signed a deal with Polydor Records in the UK in June . 
 In July , independent record label National Anthem re @-@ released the Forever EP on 10 " vinyl , containing the original three songs along with a fourth track , a remix of " Forever " by Dan <unk> . Following dates supporting Mumford & Sons on their Gentlemen of the Road tour in the US in August , Haim toured the UK for the first time in November 2012 and then supported Florence and the Machine on their UK and Ireland tour in December . 
 British music magazine New Musical Express made the title track of the Forever EP its number 4 track of 2012 . On January 4 , 2013 the BBC announced that Haim had topped their annual Sound of 2013 music industry poll to find the most promising new musical acts for the coming year . The group also signed a management contract with the conglomerate Roc Nation , returned to South by SouthWest in March 2013 and earned their own " At Your Request " video feature on Idolator . In early 2013 , they were featured on American recording artist Kid Cudi 's third studio album Indicud , on the song titled " Red Eye " . Danielle Haim appeared on the first track , " You 're No Good " , from Major Lazer 's second album , Free the Universe , alongside Santigold , Vybz Kartel and Yasmin .

 The group spent a year recording their first album , Days Are Gone in sessions between live shows . The group experimented with drum machines and the music program GarageBand , adding hip hop and R & B influences to their existing sound . Polydor recommended producers Ariel Rechtshaid and James Ford to help with the album , who suggested further use of synthesizers , bringing the album closer to a <unk> pop style . Several of the drum tracks were recorded with gated reverb , made famous by Phil Collins . In June 2013 , the group performed at Glastonbury Festival , and in addition to their own set , the band appeared with Primal Scream performing background vocals on " It 's Alright , It 's OK " , " Rocks " and " Come Together " . The band returned for a repeat performance at Glastonbury in 2014 . 
 The single " The Wire " was released on July 29 and the album followed on 30 September . The album reached number one in the UK and has since sold 200 @,@ 000 copies there . To promote the album , the group performed " The Wire " on the BBC 's The Andrew Marr Show , with Este dedicating the song to the British Prime Minister David Cameron , also a guest on the show . The move was criticised as being ill @-@ judged by Johnny Marr , who stated that “ It ’ s really simple : they made themselves look like idiots . It ’ s ridiculous . No @-@ one put a gun to their head . The Conservatives tried to do the same thing with The Smiths , to re @-@ appropriate us in a false way , to be cool by association . ” Haim did not respond . 
 Haim subsequently toured Europe throughout the remainder of 2013 , recruiting touring keyboardist Tommy King , as well as performing as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on November 23 with host Josh Hutcherson . The group performed " The Wire " and " Don 't Save Me " and Este considered this performance particularly poignant as a high school drama teacher had once told her " You 're never going to be on Saturday Night Live . " The main US tour followed in April 2014 and continued into May .

 In 2014 , Haim were awarded the NME " Best International Band " award . In August , the band released the video for " My Song 5 " in a remixed version , featuring American rapper , A $ AP Ferg . This is the sixth single taken from Days Are Gone . Haim and Jon Heder made an appearance for the music video of <unk> 's " Old 45 's " . In October , the group recorded a cover of Fleetwood Mac 's " Rhiannon " with Stevie Nicks . As of October 2014 , the group are recording their second album , having written a bulk of new material while on tour over the year . The band is also featured on the original soundtrack of The Hunger Games : Mockingjay – Part 1 and The Divergent Series : Insurgent . In November , the group contributed their vocals to the track " Pray to God " on Calvin Harris ' fourth studio album Motion . 
 The group have become friends with singer @-@ songwriter Taylor Swift , and together they have visited Catalina and Maui , Hawaii . In the summer of 2015 , Haim opened for Taylor Swift at select dates on The 1989 World Tour . The group were nominated for Best New Artist at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards . Danielle was injured in an accident just before the awards , but shortly afterwards tweeted that she was recovering . 
 On March 29 , 2016 , Haim released a teaser announcing new music and a new tour coming in summer 2016 to their Instagram page . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 Haim has been compared to the 1970s soft @-@ rock band Fleetwood Mac , though the group say they are " squeamish " about this comparison and insist they are influenced by more recent music . According to Metro , their music sounds like folk @-@ rock " with a few R & B / hip @-@ hop stylings thrown in for good measure " . The group are fans of , and have been influenced by Beyoncé , covering her song " XO " on BBC Radio 1 's " Live Lounge " , and described " My Song 5 " as " ripping off " Justin Timberlake . 
 The group have rejected the " girl band " label , preferring to be respected as musicians on their individual merits . Alana stated , " When people call us a girl band , I take it as an insult – being a girl in a band shouldn ’ t be a thing . ” All three sisters are proficient on more than one instrument : Este plays both guitar and bass , Danielle plays guitar and drums , and Alana plays guitar , keyboards and percussion . For live performances , Este plays bass , Danielle plays lead guitar and sings lead vocals , and Alana plays rhythm guitar along with keyboards and percussion . All three sisters contribute three part vocal harmony . 
 The band 's live sound is different to that in the studio . Writing for NME , Hazel Sheffield said that Days Are Gone " may confuse those won over by their raw , rocking live shows . " Recordings demonstrate the group 's vocal pop style , while the group play typical rock material such as Fleetwood Mac 's " Oh Well " in concert . The group 's background in wedding bands from their days as <unk> has led them to cover many different songs live and for radio sessions , including Miley Cyrus ' " Wrecking Ball " , Sheryl Crow 's " Strong Enough " and the Strokes ' " I 'll Try Anything Once " ( an early version of " You Only Live Once " ) . Este acts as the group 's MC onstage , announcing most of the songs . Many of her on stage antics , such as her blunt and coarse banter with the audience , frequent <unk> and her amusing facial expressions ( the " bass face " ) while playing are staples of the band 's live shows and to a lesser extent , the band 's public image . 
 Hutton has said that Este is his favourite bassist to play with . Though he declines to appear in press and publicity photos , he is nevertheless a full @-@ time member of the band .

 Critical reaction to Haim has been positive . PopMatters ' Matt James wrote " It 'd be hard to truly dislike Haim . They 're an eminently likeable , albeit slightly kooky , trio whose story already bears the frisson of legend . " Writing for The Guardian , Alexis Petridis praised the band 's songwriting abilities , saying it " has a certain kind of glossily <unk> pop perfection down pat " . The band 's sound has been described as " nu @-@ folk @-@ meets @-@ nineties @-@ R & B " and " music that sounds like it was written on a lakeside retreat attended by Stevie Nicks , John Waite and En Vogue " . 
 In her survey of pop music in 2013 , Observer critic Kitty Empire praised the band for " using the vector of harmonies to splice R & B with 1970s soft rock . They laid waste , too , to a herd of ghastly old hobby horses about guitar bands being unmarketable and record sales only being tied to women 's state of undress . "

 = Columbia Slough = 
 The Columbia Slough is a narrow waterway , about 19 miles ( 31 km ) long , in the floodplain of the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Oregon . From its source in the Portland suburb of Fairview , the Columbia Slough meanders west through Gresham and Portland to the Willamette River , about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the Willamette 's confluence with the Columbia . It is a remnant of the historic wetlands between the mouths of the Sandy River to the east and the Willamette River to the west . Levees surround much of the main slough as well as many side sloughs , detached sloughs , and nearby lakes . Drainage district employees control water flows with pumps and floodgates . Tidal fluctuations cause reverse flow on the lower slough . 
 The Columbia floodplain , formed by geologic processes including lava flows , volcanic eruptions , and the Missoula Floods , is part of the Portland Basin , which extends across the Columbia River from Multnomah County , Oregon , into Clark County , Washington . Five percent of Oregon 's population , about 158 @,@ 000 people , live in the slough watershed of about 51 square miles ( 130 km2 ) . Municipal wells near the upper slough provide supplemental drinking water to Portland and nearby cities . The cities , the drainage districts , the county , and a regional government , Metro , have overlapping jurisdictions in the watershed . A regional agency operates Portland International Airport along the middle slough and marine terminals near the lower slough . The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) and the city 's Bureau of Environmental Services ( BES ) deal with environmental issues . 
 Long before non @-@ indigenous people explored the region , tribes of Native Americans fished and hunted along the slough . In the early 19th century fur trappers and explorers including Lewis and Clark visited the area before large migrations of settlers began arriving from the east . The newcomers farmed , cut timber , built houses , and by the early 20th century established cities , shipping ports , roads , rail lines and industries near the slough . Increased investment in the floodplain led to larger losses during floods , and these losses prompted levee building that greatly altered the area . A flood pouring through a levee break in 1948 destroyed the city of Vanport , which was never rebuilt . 
 Used as a waste repository during the first half of the 20th century and cut off from the Columbia River by levees , the slough became one of Oregon 's most polluted waterways . Early attempts to mitigate the pollution , which included raw sewage and industrial waste , were unsuccessful . However , in 1952 Portland began sewage treatment , and over the next six decades the federal Clean Water Act and similar legislation mandated further cleanup . State and local governments , often assisted by community volunteers , undertook projects related to public health , natural resources , and recreation in a region with many homes , industries , businesses , and roads . The businesses and industries in the watershed employ about 57 @,@ 000 people , which is also frequented by more than 150 bird species and 26 fish species and animals including otters , beaver , and coyotes . One of the nation 's largest freshwater urban wetlands , Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area , shares the lower slough watershed with a sewage treatment plant , marine terminals , a golf course , and a car racetrack . <unk> able to portage over culverts and levees can travel the entire length of the slough . The 40 Mile Loop and other hiking and biking trails follow the waterways and connect the parks .

 Slough usually rhymes with shoe in the U.S. except in New England , where it usually rhymes with now , the preferred British pronunciation . Slough may mean a place of deep mud or mire , a swamp , a river inlet or backwater , or a creek in a marsh or tide flat . The Columbia Slough is classified as a " stream " in the Geographic Names Information System ( GNIS ) of the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) . The slough takes its name from the Columbia River , of which it was historically a side channel or <unk> . Robert Gray , a Boston fur trader and whaler who sailed partway up the Columbia River in 1792 , named the river after his ship , Columbia Rediviva . The Columbia part of the ship 's name belonged to the tradition of naming things after explorer Christopher Columbus . 
 = = Course = = 
 The Columbia Slough flows roughly parallel to and about 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 7 miles ( 0 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 7 km ) south of the Columbia River in Multnomah County . It begins at Fairview Lake in the city of Fairview and immediately enters the city of Gresham . Less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) later , it enters the city of Portland and continues generally westward for about another 18 miles ( 29 km ) to its confluence with the Willamette River . Throughout its course , the slough is nearly level , 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above sea level at the source and 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) at the mouth . <unk> tides cause reverse currents on the lower 8 @.@ 5 miles ( 13 @.@ 7 km ) of the slough . 
 Running slightly north of and parallel to U.S. Route 30 ( Sandy Boulevard ) , the slough flows by Zimmerman Heritage Farm on the left bank ( south ) about 17 @.@ 5 miles ( 28 @.@ 2 km ) from the mouth , Big Four Corners Wetlands on the right bank shortly thereafter , and receives Wilkes Creek on the left shortly after that . At about river mile ( RM ) 15 @.@ 5 or river kilometer ( RK ) 24 @.@ 9 , it passes through a gated levee that separates the upper slough from the middle slough . Soon it passes Prison Pond Wetlands near Inverness Jail and connects to Johnson Lake Slough , all on the left . Shortly thereafter , it flows under Interstate 205 . From here and for most of the rest of its course , the slough runs parallel to and slightly north of Columbia Boulevard . Passing Johnson Lake on the left , it crosses the <unk> National Golf Course and flows by Portland International Airport and an Oregon Air National Guard base on the right . On the left is Whitaker Ponds Natural Area . Shortly thereafter , it receives Whitaker Slough on the left and crosses the Broadmoor Golf Course . Between 9 and 8 miles ( 14 and 13 km ) from the mouth , it receives Buffalo Slough from the left and passes by the defunct Peninsula Drainage Canal ( City Canal ) , which lies to the slough 's right . At this point , it passes through a second gated levee that separates the middle slough from the lower slough and its tidal flow reversals . 
 In the next stretch , the Columbia Slough flows by Portland Meadows horse racing track on the right and crosses under Interstate 5 at about RM 7 ( RK 11 ) . Beyond the interstate , to the slough 's north lies Delta Park , Portland International Raceway , and the Heron Lakes Golf Course . Until flooding destroyed it in 1948 , the city of Vanport occupied this site . To the south is the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant . 
 The slough flows through the Wapato Wetland and by the Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area , including the former St. Johns Landfill , on the right at about RM 3 ( RK 4 @.@ 8 ) from the Willamette River , and by Pier Park on the left . Shortly thereafter , it turns sharply north for the rest of its course . It receives North Slough , connected to Bybee Lake , on the right , and passes through the Ramsey Lake Wetlands and Kelley Point Park before entering the Willamette River about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from its confluence with the Columbia River . The mouth of the Columbia River is about 101 miles ( 163 km ) further downstream at Astoria on the Pacific Ocean .

 Since 1989 , the USGS has monitored the flow of the Columbia Slough at a stream gauge 0 @.@ 6 miles ( 1 @.@ 0 km ) from the mouth . The average flow recorded at this gauge is 93 @.@ 8 cubic feet per second ( 3 m3 / s ) from a drainage area of undetermined size . The maximum flow was 2 @,@ 400 cubic feet per second ( 68 m3 / s ) on December 5 , 1995 , and the minimum flow ( biggest reverse flow ) was − 6 @,@ 700 cubic feet per second ( − 190 m3 / s ) on February 7 , 1996 , which coincided with a flood on the Columbia and Willamette rivers . 
 = = Watershed = = 
 Draining about 51 square miles ( 130 km2 ) , the Columbia Slough watershed lies in the floodplain of the Columbia River between the mouths of the Sandy River to the east and the Willamette River . Parts of Portland , Fairview , Gresham , Maywood Park , Wood Village , and unincorporated Multnomah County lie within the drainage basin ( watershed ) . As of 2005 , about 158 @,@ 000 people , 5 percent of Oregon 's population , lived in the basin . 
 The watershed includes residential neighborhoods , agriculture , the airport , open spaces , 54 schools , interstate highways , railways , commercial businesses , and heavy and light industry . In general , the northern part is industrial and commercial ; the southern part is residential , and agricultural areas lie to the east . As of 2001 , single @-@ family residential zones covered 33 percent of the watershed , and mixed @-@ use zones accounted for another 33 percent . The other zones were 12 percent industrial , 12 percent parks or open space ; 6 percent multi @-@ family residential , 3 percent commercial , and 2 percent were for farming or forests . As of 2005 , about 3 @,@ 900 businesses operated in the watershed and employed about 57 @,@ 000 people . 
 Adjacent to the Columbia Slough basin are the watersheds of the Sandy River to the east , Johnson Creek to the south , the Willamette to the south and west , and the Columbia to the north . Lying slightly north of the watershed , large islands in the Columbia River include , from east to west , McGuire Island , Government Island , Lemon Island , and Tomahawk Island , which is connected to Hayden Island . Bordered by the Columbia and two arms of the Willamette , Sauvie Island lies just west of the mouth of the slough . 
 = = = Jurisdiction = = = 
 Many governmental entities share responsibility for the slough and its drainage basin . Decisions by the municipal governments of Portland , Fairview , Gresham , Maywood Park , and Wood Village , and the government of Multnomah County affect the slough . Metro , the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the Portland metropolitan area , is involved in acquiring and protecting wildlife habitat in places like Big Four Corners Wetlands and Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area , acquiring property to close gaps in the 40 Mile Loop and other trails , and creating additional water access along the slough . The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has designated the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) to regulate the slough under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act . The Port of Portland , a regional agency run by commissioners appointed by the Oregon governor , owns and manages about 11 percent of the land in the slough watershed . Three drainage districts that manage water flows in the slough floodplain overlap parts of these other jurisdictions . 
 = = = Annual report card = = = 
 In 2015 , Portland 's Bureau of Environmental Services ( BES ) began issuing annual " report cards " for watersheds or fractions thereof that lie within the city . BES assigns grades for each of four categories : hydrology , water quality , habitat , and fish and wildlife . Hydrology grades depend on the amount of pavement and other impervious surfaces in the watershed and to what degree its streams flow freely , not dammed or diverted . Water @-@ quality grades are based on measurements of dissolved oxygen , E @-@ coli bacteria , temperature , suspended solids , and substances such as mercury and phosphorus . Habitat ranking depends on the condition of stream banks and floodplains , riparian zones , tree canopies , and other variables . The fish and wildlife assessment includes birds , fish , and macroinvertebrates . In 2015 , the BES grades for the Columbia Slough are hydrology , B − ; water quality , B − ; habitat , D − , and fish and wildlife , F.

 The Columbia Slough is part of the roughly 770 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 000 km2 ) Portland Basin , which lies at the northern end of the Willamette Valley of Oregon and extends north into Clark County in the state of Washington . The region is underlain by solidified lavas of the Columbia River Basalt Group that are up to 16 million years old . Covered by later alluvial deposits , the basalts lie more than 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) below the surface within the basin . About 10 million years ago , eruptions of Cascade Range volcanoes to the east sent flows of mud , ash , and eroded volcanic debris into the Columbia , which was powerful enough to carry the material downstream . <unk> above the basalt during the Miocene and early Pliocene , these loose sands and gravels formed part of what is known as the Troutdale Formation . Extending to the Tualatin River Valley to the south and into Clark County on the north , the formation is an aquifer that is the primary source of drinking water for Vancouver in Washington and an auxiliary source for Portland . 
 The Portland Basin is being pulled slowly apart between faults in the Tualatin Mountains ( West Hills ) on the west side of Portland , the East Bank fault along the east side of the Willamette River , and other fault systems near Gresham further east . About 3 million years ago , many small volcanoes and cinder cones erupted through the thin , stretched crust of the basin and in the Cascade foothills to the southeast . Ash , cinders , and debris from these Boring Lava Field volcanoes added another layer of sediment to the Troutdale formation . 
 About 15 @,@ 000 years ago , cataclysmic ice age events known as the Missoula Floods or Bretz Floods originating in the Clark Fork region of northern Idaho inundated the Columbia River basin many times . These floods deposited huge amounts of debris and sediment . Water filled the entire Columbia Gorge to overflowing and turned the Willamette Valley into a lake 100 miles ( 160 km ) long , 60 miles ( 100 km ) wide and 300 feet ( 90 m ) deep . The floodwaters ripped the face off Rocky Butte in Portland and deposited a 5 @-@ mile ( 8 km ) gravel bar , Alameda Ridge , that runs parallel to and slightly south of the Columbia Slough . 
 Faults associated with the expanding Portland Basin are capable of producing significant earthquakes . More than a thousand earthquakes , many too small to be felt , have been recorded in the basin since 1841 . The stronger ones reached about magnitude 5 on the Richter scale . In 1892 , one estimated at magnitude 5 shook downtown Portland for about 30 seconds . In 1962 , one centered about 7 miles ( 11 km ) north of Portland was estimated at between magnitude 4 @.@ 9 and 5 @.@ 2 .

 = = = Rainfall and runoff = = = 
 Based on records from 1961 to 1990 , the watershed 's average annual precipitation , as measured at Portland International Airport , is about 36 inches ( 910 mm ) . About 21 inches ( 530 mm ) falls from November through February and only about 4 inches ( 100 mm ) from June through September . Since temperatures are normally below freezing fewer than 30 days a year , most of this precipitation reaches the ground as rain . 
 Historically , most rain falling on the watershed was taken up by vegetation , flowed into wetlands , soaked into the ground , or evaporated . Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided <unk> to the slough during dry summers . Urban development , which replaced vegetation and water @-@ absorbing soils with airport runways , house roofs , highways , warehouses , parking lots , and other hard surfaces , interrupted this cycle . In 1999 , a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54 percent of the watershed . Storm runoff that might have taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours . 
 = = = Main channel = = = 
 Until the 20th century , the slough and its side channels and associated ponds and lakes were part of the active Columbia River floodplain . When the historic river was high , the slough received water from it near Big Four Corners , about 17 miles ( 27 km ) from the slough 's mouth . In 1917 , landowners formed three drainage districts — Peninsula Drainage District No. 1 ( Pen 1 ) , Peninsula Drainage District No. 2 ( Pen 2 ) , and Multnomah County Drainage District No. 1 ( MCDD ) — to control flooding . A fourth district , the Sandy Drainage Improvement Company ( <unk> ) , manages water flow at the upper end of the slough 's basin in Fairview and Troutdale . By 2008 , the districts maintained 30 miles ( 48 km ) of levees as well as water pumps , floodgates and other water control devices . 
 The upper slough extends from the slough 's source at Fairview Lake , roughly 18 @.@ 5 miles ( 30 km ) from the mouth , to a gated levee known as the mid @-@ dike levee about 3 miles ( 5 km ) downstream . This sector , managed by MCDD , covers 2 @,@ 650 acres ( 1 @,@ 070 ha ) completely surrounded by levees . A northern side channel extends from the mid @-@ dike levee to MCDD Pump Station No. 4 on the Columbia River ( Marine Drive ) levee near Big Four Corners . Water usually exits this sector through the open gates of the mid @-@ dike levee , but to control threatening flows the MCDD can close the gate and pump water from the northern side channel directly into the Columbia . The pump 's maximum capacity is 275 @,@ 000 U.S. gallons per minute ( 17 @,@ 300 L / s ) . 
 The middle slough , also managed by MCDD , lies between the mid @-@ dike levee and the Pen 2 levee , 8 @.@ 5 miles ( 13 @.@ 7 km ) from the mouth . This sector covers 6 @,@ 848 acres ( 2 @,@ 771 ha ) , is completely surrounded by levees , and contains many side sloughs , ponds , small lakes , and springs . Pump Station No. 1 rests on the Pen 2 levee , which is gated across the course of the slough . To control flows , MCDD can open or close the gates , and it can pump water from the middle slough to the lower slough when its flow is reversed by the tide or when gravity flow is insufficient . The pump 's capacity is 250 @,@ 000 US gallons per minute ( 16 m3 / s ) . 
 Water levels in the lower slough , managed by Pen 2 and Pen 1 , depend more on Willamette River conditions than on pumping by MCDD . Incoming tides cause a variation in water surface elevation of between 12 inches ( 30 cm ) and 24 inches ( 61 cm ) roughly twice per day along the entire lower slough . Flow direction varies with the tide . Pen 2 and Pen 1 , separated by Interstate 5 , border the north side of the lower slough . Pen 2 manages 1 @,@ 475 acres ( 597 ha ) east of the highway , and Pen 1 manages 901 acres ( 365 ha ) to the west ( downstream ) . Multiple pump stations move water from lesser sloughs in both districts into the main slough . Parts of this subwatershed are unprotected by levees and are vulnerable to 100 @-@ year floods . 
 = = = Creeks and lakes = = = 
 Historically Fairview Creek flowed north into the Columbia River through a wetlands slightly upstream of Big Four Corners . In the early 20th century , water managers dug an artificial channel connecting the Fairview Creek wetlands to the slough . In 1960 , they built a dam on the west side of the wetlands to create Fairview Lake for water storage and recreation . It covers about 100 acres ( 40 ha ) and is 5 to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 8 m ) deep . Fairview Creek forms in a wetland near Grant Butte and flows north for 5 miles ( 8 km ) through the cities of Gresham and Fairview to reach the lake . Fairview Creek has two named tributaries , No Name Creek , and Clear Creek . A smaller stream , Osborn Creek , also flows into the lake , which empties through a weir and culvert system into the upper slough . 
 With one exception , the streams feeding Fairview Lake are the watershed 's only remaining creeks , although springs also reach the surface . Wilkes Creek , the slough 's only free flowing tributary , is about 2 miles ( 3 km ) long and enters the upper slough from the south . Dozens of similar streams that once flowed into the slough from the south have all been piped or filled . Many bodies of water in addition to the main slough channel lie within the drainage basin . The area around the middle slough contains several slough arms and small lakes , including Buffalo Slough , Whitaker Slough , Johnson Lake , Whitaker Ponds , and Prison Pond . In the lower slough , Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area at 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 ha ) is one of the largest urban freshwater wetlands in the United States . A 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) side slough called North Slough connects Bybee Lake and the main slough channel . A water control structure at the outlet from Bybee Lake to the North Slough regulates the lakes ' levels . 
 = = = <unk> and wells = = = 
 Groundwater discharges from an aquifer near the surface supply an estimated flow between 50 and 100 cubic feet per second ( 1 @.@ 4 and 2 @.@ 8 m3 / s ) to the middle and upper sloughs . Rain infiltration and artificial sumps recharge this shallow aquifer . Geologists have identified four other major aquifers separated by relatively impermeable clays or other strata at various levels below the surface aquifer . The City of Portland 's water bureau manages the Columbia South Shore Well Field that taps the deeper aquifers . As of 2004 , 25 active wells drawing from depths ranging from 60 to 600 feet ( 18 to 183 m ) could produce up to 100 million US gallons ( 380 @,@ 000 m3 ) a day from the field . These were drilled between 1976 and 2003 to supplement the city 's main water supply from the Bull Run Watershed during droughts or emergencies . The Rockwood Water People 's Utility District ( <unk> ) and the City of Fairview have also drilled three wells near the upper slough .

 Archeological evidence suggests that Native Americans lived along the lower Columbia River as early as 10 @,@ 000 years ago , including near what later became The Dalles , on the Columbia River about 70 miles ( 110 km ) east of the Columbia Slough . By 2 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 000 years ago , the Clackamas Indians had settled along the Clackamas River , which empties into the Willamette River about 25 miles ( 40 km ) south of the slough . The Clackamas tribe was a subgroup of the Chinookan speakers who lived in the Columbia River Valley from Celilo Falls to the Pacific Ocean . Clackamas lands included the lower Willamette River from Willamette Falls , at what later became Oregon City , to the Willamette 's confluence with the Columbia River . The Columbia River floodplain near the mouth of the Willamette contained many stream channels , lakes , and wetlands that flooded annually . Chinookan tribes hunted and fished there and traveled between the two big rivers via the protected waters of the slough . Their main food sources were salmon , sturgeon , and camas . 
 In 1792 , Lieutenant William Broughton , a British explorer , led the first trip by non @-@ natives as far up the Columbia River as the mouth of the Sandy River . He and his men camped on Sauvie Island , which lies between the Willamette and Columbia rivers directly opposite the mouth of the slough . Broughton encountered many Chinookans while exploring and mapping geographic features including Hayden Island and other islands in the Columbia just north of the slough . When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806 , the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1 @,@ 800 people living in 11 villages . The explorers estimated that 800 people of the Multnomah tribe of Chinookans lived in five villages on Sauvie Island . 
 In 1825 , the Hudson 's Bay Company established its western administrative headquarters at Fort Vancouver , across the Columbia River from the slough . The British fort became the center for fur trading and other commerce throughout the Pacific Northwest , including what would later become the state of Oregon . By the 1830s , smallpox , malaria , measles and other diseases carried by non @-@ indigenous explorers and traders had reduced the native population by up to 90 percent throughout the lower Columbia basin . The United States gained control over the Oregon Territory — including Fort Vancouver , the Portland Basin , and the slough — by treaty with Great Britain in 1846 . By 1851 , the Clackamas tribe 's population had fallen to 88 , and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands to the U.S.

 By 1850 , White settlers established donation land claims in the Columbia Slough watershed . One settler , Lewis Love , became wealthy by cutting timber in the watershed and using the slough as part of a shipping route to downtown Portland . Other settlers logged the forests near the slough and built sawmills , fished , and farmed . In 1852 , James John operated a ferry based on the peninsula of land between the Columbia and the Willamette River . The community of St. Johns , platted in the same year on the peninsula , is named after him . Legislation creating the Port of Portland in 1891 improved St. Johns ' prospects as a Willamette River port . In 1902 , the U.S. Congress passed a Reclamation Act that encouraged irrigation , flood control , and wetland development in places like the peninsula . In 1907 , the Spokane , Portland and Seattle Railway began work on a rail line across the peninsula . The railway and the port improvements led to high expectations . " St. Johns , the City of Destiny " , a 1909 editorial appearing in a booster publication called The Peninsula , said : 
 Nature has been more than lavish in her gifts to St. Johns . Travel as many miles as you like and go where you will , it is highly improbable that you will find a spot with so many magnificent nature advantages as has St. Johns . The fine stretch of level land on which the city is located , the deep water of the two rivers , the navigable sloughs and the superb scenery which nature has painted with a master hand , makes the location an ideal one in every respect either for industries or residences .

 As Portland grew , it annexed St. Johns and expanded into the peninsula and other parts of the watershed . East of St. Johns , the Swift Meatpacking Company bought 3 @,@ 400 acres ( 1 @,@ 400 ha ) in 1906 and established the community of Kenton . Other companies built packing plants and slaughterhouses along the slough , and by 1911 Portland had become the main livestock market for the Pacific Northwest . These and other early 20th century businesses , including stockyards , a dairy farm , a shingle company , and a lumber mill , flushed waste products into the slough . Starting in 1910 , north Portland 's residential sewage also poured into the slough through pipes laid for the purpose . In 1917 , landowners along the slough had formed three drainage districts to control floods . They dug ditches , deepened existing water channels , and built levees to keep the rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural , industrial , and commercial property . Hoping to flush the slough with clean water from the river , city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal . The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough 's flow and because both ends of the canal were at nearly the same elevation . 
 Over the next 30 years , more lumber and wood products companies opened along the slough , and tugboats moved log rafts up and down the waterway . Truck freight and other transportation companies built in the watershed . The city created the St. Johns Landfill on wetlands and small channels off the lower slough and built a new Portland Airport on land along the middle slough . Activists and civic leaders , concerned about pollution on the Willamette River , led cleanup campaigns , but voters declined to pay for sewage treatment . Pollution eventually grew so bad on the slough that mill workers refused to handle logs that had been stored in its water .

 After the start of the war with Japan , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an order for internment of all the people of Japanese ancestry who lived on the West Coast . About 1 @,@ 700 of them lived in Portland , and some had farms or businesses near the slough . When the government removed them from their homes in 1942 , it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center ( Expo Center ) in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland . They were not allowed to return until 1945 . 
 In 1942 , Kaiser Shipbuilding Company began making ships for the war at three huge installations near the lower slough , one in St. Johns , one on Swan Island in Portland 's Overlook neighborhood , and one in Vancouver , Washington . St. Johns and Vancouver made Liberty ships , while Swan Island made tankers . The St. Johns shipyard became the nation 's leading producer of Liberty ships . To house shipyard workers and their families , Henry J. Kaiser bought 650 acres ( 260 ha ) of former marsh , pasture , and farmland in the lower slough watershed surrounded on all sides by dikes between 15 and 25 feet ( 5 and 8 m ) high . Here he built a new city , at first called <unk> and later Vanport . By 1943 , Vanport 's population of 39 @,@ 000 made it the second largest city in Oregon and the largest wartime housing project in the U.S. After the war , the population fell to about 18 @,@ 500 . This was roughly the number of people living there on May 30 , 1948 , when a flood broke through Vanport 's western levee . The break occurred during the afternoon of a day with mild weather . The first rush of water soon became a " creeping inundation " , slowed in its advance for 35 to 40 minutes by water @-@ absorbing sloughs . The water 's gradual rise within the city allowed most of the residents to escape drowning . The county coroner 's official list of bodies recovered was set at fifteen , and seven people on a list of missing people were never found . The flood destroyed the city , which was never rebuilt . 
 The Vanport flood induced changes to the slough 's system of levees , which were rebuilt and in some cases fortified to withstand a 100 @-@ year flood . Instead of repairing the levee along the Peninsula Canal , the city plugged it at both ends . The disaster also affected Oregon 's system of higher education . After floodwaters destroyed the Vanport Extension Center , set up in 1946 , the Oregon Board of Higher Education reestablished the school in downtown Portland , where it eventually became Portland State University . 
 Debate about how to use the slough and its watershed continued through the rest of the century . In 1964 , the Port of Portland , interested in industrial development , began to fill Smith , Bybee , and Ramsey lakes with dredge sands from the Columbia . In the 1970s , the Oregon Legislature passed a law against filling Smith or Bybee lakes below a contour line 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) above mean sea level except to enhance fish and wildlife habitat . Plans for a Willamette River Greenway project proposed by Oregon Governor Tom McCall in the late 1960s called for park and recreation areas along the Willamette and many of its tributaries but ignored the slough . Some planners argued that the slough was so filthy that more industry was all it was good for . They portrayed cleanup as a lofty but impractical goal . 
 At Oregon 's request , the U.S. Congress stripped the slough of its navigable status in 1978 . This ended channel dredging on the slough , which could then be used for recreation . Other laws affecting the slough in the 1970s and beyond were the federal Clean Water Act and the Oregon Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act . In 1986 , a business association began promoting commercial development along the upper slough , and the city later used urban renewal funds to support industrial projects near the airport . In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area , where it began a slough watershed education program for children . 
 = = Pollution = = 
 After years of piping raw sewage directly into the waterway , Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952 . The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system from all over the city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River . When runoff exceeded the plant 's capacity during heavy rains , sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows ( CSO ) s at 13 outfalls . 
 The city closed the St. Johns Landfill , adjacent to the lower slough , in 1991 . Pressed by citizen action groups , it agreed in 1993 to establish a 50 @-@ foot ( 15 m ) environmental conservation zone along the slough . In response to a threatened lawsuit , the city began a comprehensive cleanup of the slough in 1994 , and a year later it received a $ 10 million grant from the EPA for the purpose . 
 Of the streams monitored in the lower Willamette basin by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) between 1986 and 1995 , the Columbia Slough had the worst pollution scores . DEQ 's measurements came from the slough at Landfill Road , 2 @.@ 6 miles ( 4 @.@ 2 km ) from the mouth . On the Oregon Water Quality Index ( OWQI ) used by DEQ , water quality scores can vary from 10 ( worst ) to 100 ( ideal ) . The average for the Columbia Slough was 22 , or " very poor " . By comparison , the average in the Willamette River at the Hawthorne Bridge in downtown Portland was 74 during the same years . Measurements of water quality at the Landfill Road site during the years covered by the DEQ report showed high concentrations of phosphates , ammonia and nitrates , fecal coliform bacteria , and suspended solids , and a high biochemical oxygen demand . High temperatures enhanced extreme eutrophication in the summer . 
 The Port of Portland began efforts in 1997 to reduce the flow of aircraft deicing chemicals from the airport into the waterway , though it still diverted concentrated chemicals ( mostly glycol ) directly into the slough during rare times of reservoir overflow . By 2012 , the Port had completed work on an enhanced system that collects , stores , and treats the chemicals , and is more likely to direct runoff to the Columbia River than the slough . 
 By 2000 the City of Portland had spent about $ 200 million to nearly eliminate <unk> from entering the slough . It also replaced septic tank and cesspool systems near the middle and upper slough with sanitary sewers . BES analysis of water samples taken between 1995 and 2002 showed that by the end of this period DEQ water quality standards for Escherichia coli , the indicator organism for fecal contamination , were nearly always being met in the upper and middle sloughs and generally being met in the lower slough . Despite these and other improvements in water quality , the slough is not a safe source of edible fish . The Multnomah County Health Department and other agencies have advised people to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of fish and crayfish from the slough because they contain polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) and pesticides .

 Development since 1850 has greatly altered the places in the watershed where plants and animals can thrive . In a report published in 2005 , the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services ( BES ) , using data from an early General Land Office survey , compared the watershed of 1851 with that of 2003 . The study showed that all of the watershed provided plant and wildlife habitat in 1851 , but by 2003 only 33 percent provided habitat . In 1851 , water covered 10 percent of the watershed but that had been cut in half by 2003 . Marshes and other wetlands that had comprised 22 percent of the earlier watershed dwindled to 1 percent by 2003 , while the percentage of land devoted to industry , commerce , and homes rose from 0 to 34 . In addition , habitat remaining in 2003 was greatly disturbed , dominated by Himalayan blackberry and other invasive species and fragmented by roads . The riparian zone along the slough was generally narrow or nonexistent and devoid of trees and shrubs in places , including along the levees . 
 In 2002 the city , the MCDD , and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began a project to improve habitat by creating 7 miles ( 11 km ) of stream meanders and wetland terraces along the slough . Through its Watershed <unk> Program , begun in 1996 , the city worked with property owners to plant native vegetation and to remove invasive weeds . Through 2005 , participants had replanted more than 500 acres ( 200 ha ) along nearly 40 miles ( 64 km ) of riparian corridors in the slough watershed . Other strategies pursued by the city , Metro , and other interest groups include connecting separated habitats with a continuous riparian corridor , removing wildlife corridor barriers , restoring hydrological connections to the slough , and restoring the floodplain where feasible . 
 = = = Fish and wildlife = = = 
 Although reduced and altered , habitats in the watershed support a wide range of wildlife , some of which is found nowhere else in Portland . Many species that used the slough in 1850 still use it . This includes more than 150 species of birds , 26 species of fish of which 12 species are native several kinds of amphibians , western pond turtles , beaver , muskrat , river otter , and black @-@ tailed deer . Juvenile salmon enter the lower slough as well as Smith and Bybee Lakes . Coastal cutthroat trout inhabit Fairview Creek and Osborn Creek . Three species of native freshwater mussel live in the slough and in Smith and Bybee Lakes . Crayfish have been found throughout the slough . Bald eagles are among the resident birds , and great blue herons have established rookeries in the watershed . Migrants that visit the slough include more than a dozen species of ducks , geese , swans , and raptors , as well as neotropical shorebirds and songbirds . Invasive species adapted to the slough include the nutria , common carp , bullfrog , and European starling . 
 = = = Vegetation = = = 
 The slough watershed lies in the Portland / Vancouver Basin ecoregion , part of the Willamette Valley ecoregion designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) . Black cottonwood , red osier dogwood , willow , Oregon white oak , and Oregon ash grow in scattered locations throughout the watershed , while wapato and Columbia sedge thrive in a few places . In the slough itself , macrophytes and algae sometimes restrict water flow and reduce water quality . Golf courses and athletic fields near the slough consist mainly of non @-@ native grasses . Developed plots with houses or businesses often have deciduous street trees , grasses , occasional conifers , and a variety of native and non @-@ native shrubs . Invasive plants include Himalayan blackberry , English ivy , reed <unk> , purple loosestrife , and Japanese knotweed .

 At the upper end of the slough , the City of Fairview manages Lakeshore Park , 5 @.@ 2 acres ( 2 @.@ 1 ha ) on the south edge of Fairview Lake . Slightly further north is Blue Lake Regional Park , a 101 @-@ acre ( 41 ha ) recreational park with a 64 @-@ acre ( 26 ha ) lake , both managed by Metro . To the northeast is Chinook Landing Marine Park , also managed by Metro . At about 67 acres ( 27 ha ) , it is Oregon 's largest public boating park on the Columbia River . 
 Big Four Corners Wetlands , managed by the Portland Parks & Recreation Department ( PPR ) , includes about 165 acres ( 67 ha ) of wetlands and forests about 17 miles ( 27 km ) from the slough 's confluence with the Willamette River . Providing habitat for deer , coyotes , and river otter as well as birds and amphibians , it is the fourth largest natural area in the city . Further downstream , a consortium of interest groups is restoring a natural area of about 15 acres ( 6 @.@ 1 ha ) at Johnson Lake . Whitaker Ponds Nature Park , at about RM 10 ( RK 16 ) , is a 25 @-@ acre ( 10 ha ) site with a walking trail , canoe launch , garden , and wildflower meadow . West of Whitaker Ponds , the Columbia Children 's Arboretum , with every state tree , lies on a 29 @-@ acre ( 12 ha ) property managed by PPR . 
 Delta Park is a large municipal park complex that straddles Interstate 5 between the slough and the Columbia River at the former Vanport site . East Delta Park , covering about 85 acres ( 34 ha ) , has a sports complex and a street @-@ tree arboretum . Portland International Raceway , for car , motorcycle , and bicycle racing , occupies about 292 acres ( 118 ha ) of West Delta Park . Adjacent to the raceway is the Heron Lakes Golf Course , 340 acres ( 140 ha ) . The grounds include wetlands and interpretive signs about Vanport . Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area , a public park and nature reserve managed by Metro , lies just west of Delta Park . At about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 ha ) , it is one of the largest urban freshwater wetlands in the United States . Kelley Point Park covers 104 acres ( 42 ha ) at the tip of the peninsula between the Willamette and Columbia rivers .

 Next to Columbia River , long segments of the 40 Mile Loop skirt the north edge of the slough watershed , while other segments such as the north – south I @-@ 205 Bike Path cross it or , as in the case of the largely unfinished Columbia Slough Trail , run through it generally along an east – west axis . The 40 Mile Loop is a partly completed greenway trail around and through Portland and other parts of Multnomah County . Originally proposed by the Olmsted Brothers , architects involved in the planning for Portland 's Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905 , it has expanded to a projected 140 miles ( 230 km ) , encircling the city and connecting parks along the Columbia , Sandy , and Willamette rivers and Johnson Creek . The parks and other public spaces in the watershed have their own pedestrian paths , some of which are also bicycle paths that connect to the 40 Mile Loop . Many gaps lie between completed trail segments . 
 Along the east side of the slough watershed , the City of Gresham has opened a 1 @.@ 24 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 00 km ) segment of the Gresham @-@ Fairview Trail , a planned 5 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 4 km ) , north – south hiking and biking route between the Springwater Corridor along Johnson Creek and the 40 Mile Loop along the Columbia River . On the west side of the watershed , the Peninsula Crossing Trail connects Willamette Cove on the Willamette River in St. Johns with the 40 Mile Loop along the Columbia River . This 3 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) linear hiking and biking trail crosses the lower slough and passes between Smith Lake and Heron Lakes Golf Course . The trail is level and accessible by wheelchair . Amenities include a picnic area , seats carved from basalt , and art installations .

 Accessible to canoers and kayakers of all skill levels , the slough is essentially flat . A trip from source to mouth is possible via the main channel but requires portages around levees and other obstacles . BES estimates the time required for a canoe trip of roughly 18 miles ( 29 km ) along the main channel to be at least nine hours . Trips along the lower 8 @.@ 5 miles ( 13 @.@ 7 km ) must be timed with the tides to allow paddling with the current . Eight launch sites , including one just below Fairview Lake at the headwaters and another at Kelley Point Park near the mouth , have been established along the slough . 
 = London Necropolis Company = 
 The London Necropolis Company ( LNC ) , formally the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Company until 1927 , was a cemetery operator established by Act of Parliament in 1852 in reaction to the crisis caused by the closure of London 's graveyards in 1851 . The LNC intended to establish a single cemetery large enough to accommodate all of London 's future burials in perpetuity . The company 's founders recognised that the recently invented technology of the railway provided the ability to conduct burials a long distance from populated areas , mitigating concerns over public health risks from living near burial sites . Accordingly , the company bought a very large tract of land in Brookwood , Surrey , around 25 miles ( 40 km ) from London , and converted a portion of it into Brookwood Cemetery . A dedicated railway line , the London Necropolis Railway , linked the new cemetery to the city . 
 Financial mismanagement and internal disputes led to delays in the project . By the time Brookwood Cemetery opened in late 1854 , a number of other cemeteries had opened nearer to London or were in the process of opening . While some parishes in London did arrange for the LNC to handle the burials of their dead , many preferred to use nearer cemeteries . The LNC had anticipated handling between 10 @,@ 000 and 50 @,@ 000 burials per year , but the number never rose above 4 @,@ 100 per year , and in its first 150 years of operations only 231 @,@ 730 burials had been conducted . Buying the land for Brookwood Cemetery and building the cemetery and railway had been very expensive , and by the time the cemetery opened the LNC was already on the verge of bankruptcy . The LNC remained solvent by selling surplus parts of its land , but as the land had been chosen in the first place for its remoteness , sales were low . 
 From the 1880s the LNC began a more aggressive programme to maximise its income . The process for the sale of surplus land was improved , resulting in increased income . The LNC redeveloped its lands at Hook Heath , Woking into housing and a golf course , creating a new suburb of Woking and providing a steady income from rentals . After an 1884 ruling that cremation was lawful in England the LNC also took advantage of its proximity to Woking Crematorium by providing transport for bodies and mourners on its railway line and after 1910 by interring ashes in a dedicated columbarium . The LNC also provided the land for a number of significant military cemeteries and memorials at Brookwood after both of the World Wars . In 1941 London Necropolis railway station , the LNC 's London railway terminus , was badly damaged by bombing , and the London Necropolis Railway was abandoned . 
 Rising property prices in Surrey in the 1940s and 1950s made the LNC increasingly valuable , but also made it a target for property speculators . In 1959 a hostile takeover succeeded , and LNC 's independence came to an end . From 1959 to 1985 a succession of owners stripped the profitable parts of the business from the company , leaving a rump residual company operating the increasingly derelict cemetery . In 1985 what remained of the company came into the ownership of Ramadan Güney , who set about reviving what remained . Links were formed with London 's Muslim communities in an effort to encourage new burials , and a slow programme of clearing and restoring the derelict sections of the cemetery commenced . Although it was never as successful as planned , the LNC was very influential on both the funeral industry and the development of the area around Woking , and Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom . 
 = = Background = = 
 Since the conversion of London to Christianity in the early 7th century , the city 's dead had been buried in and around the local churches . With a limited amount of space for burials , the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials , and the remains of the previous occupants transferred to charnel houses for storage . From the 14th century onwards the charnel houses themselves were overwhelmed , and exhumed bones were scattered where they had been dug up or reburied in pits . Despite this practice , by the mid 17th century the city was running seriously short of burial space . A proposal by Christopher Wren to use the reconstruction following the 1666 Great Fire of London as an opportunity to cease burials in the churchyards and establish new cemeteries outside the city was approved by the King and Parliament but vetoed by the Corporation of London , and burials continued at the newly rebuilt churches . 
 In the first half of the 19th century the population of London more than doubled , from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851 . Despite this rapid growth in population , the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300 acres ( 0 @.@ 47 sq mi ; 1 @.@ 2 km2 ) , spread across around 200 small sites . The difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked on top of each other to fit the available space and covered with a layer of earth . In more crowded areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials , their contents being unearthed and scattered to free up space . In some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds , unearthing the previous burials , and fresh corpses crammed into the available space . Intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture , coffin wood was burned as household fuel , and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to the north of England to be sold as fertiliser . Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera , smallpox , measles and typhoid ; in 1842 the mean working life of a London professional man was 30 years and of a London labourer just 17 years . 
 Public health policy at this time was shaped by the miasma theory ( the belief that airborne particles released by decaying flesh were the primary factor in the spread of contagious illness ) , and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern . A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London 's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one . Commissioner and sanitation campaigner Edwin Chadwick testified that each year , 20 @,@ 000 adults and 30 @,@ 000 children were being buried in less than 218 acres ( 0 @.@ 34 sq mi ; 0 @.@ 88 km2 ) of already full burial grounds ; the Commission heard that one cemetery , Spa Fields in Clerkenwell , designed to hold 1 @,@ 000 bodies , contained 80 @,@ 000 graves , and that gravediggers throughout London were obliged to shred bodies in order to cram the remains into available grave space . In 1848 – 49 a cholera epidemic killed 14 @,@ 601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely . Bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial , and even relatively recent graves were exhumed to make way for new burials . 
 = = = Proposed solutions to the burial crisis = = = 
 In the wake of public concerns following the cholera epidemic and the findings of the Royal Commission , the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis ( Burials Act ) was passed in 1851 . Under the Burials Act , new burials were prohibited in what were then the built @-@ up areas of London . Seven large cemeteries had recently opened a short distance from London or were in the process of opening , and temporarily became London 's main burial grounds . A proposal by Francis Seymour Haden to ship the bodies of London 's dead to the Thames Estuary for use in land reclamation met with little approval , and the government sought alternative means to prevent the constantly increasing number of deaths in London from overwhelming the new cemeteries in the same manner in which it had overwhelmed the traditional burial grounds . 
 The new suburban cemeteries had a combined size of just 282 acres ( 0 @.@ 44 sq mi ; 1 @.@ 1 km2 ) , and the Board of Health did not consider any of them suitable for long @-@ term use . As a long term solution to the crisis , Edwin Chadwick proposed the closure of all existing burial grounds in the vicinity of London other than the privately owned Kensal Green Cemetery in west London . Kensal Green Cemetery was to be nationalised and greatly enlarged to provide a single burial ground for west London . A large tract of land on the Thames around 9 miles ( 14 km ) southeast of London in Abbey Wood ( on the site of present @-@ day Thamesmead ) was to become a single burial ground for east London . All bodies would be shipped by river and canal to the new cemeteries , bringing an end to burials in London itself . 
 The Treasury was sceptical that Chadwick 's scheme would ever be financially viable . It also met with widespread public concerns about the impact of monopoly control of the burial industry , and about the government taking control of an industry previously controlled by religious bodies and private entrepreneurs . The process of decomposition was still poorly understood and it was generally believed that 12 ⁄ 13 ( 92 % ) of a decaying corpse was dispersed as gas ; local authorities in the vicinity of the proposed new cemeteries were horrified at the prospect of an estimated 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 85 @,@ 000 m3 ) per year of miasma ( disease @-@ carrying vapour ) spreading from the cemeteries across surrounding areas . Although the Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 authorised Chadwick 's scheme to proceed , the Metropolitan Interment Amendment Act 1852 repealed the authorisation .

 An area of ground so distant as to be beyond any possible future extension of the Capital , sufficiently large to allow of its sub @-@ division , not only into spacious distinct portions for the burial of each sect of the Christian Public , but also , if desired and deemed expedient , into as many separate compartments as there are parishes within London and its suburbs … [ and ] a Mausoleum Church , with funeral chapels , private mausolea , vaults , and catacombs , large enough to contain , not only the thousands of coffins now lying within our numerous Metropolitan Churches , but also the coffins of all such dying in London , in this and future generations ... [ A ] grand and befitting gathering place for the metropolitan mortality of a mighty nation ; a last home and bed of rest where the ashes of the high and low , the mighty and the weak , the learned and the ignorant , the wicked and the good , the idle and the industrious , in one vast co @-@ mingled heap may repose together . 
 While the negotiations over the state taking control of burials were ongoing , an alternative proposal was being drawn up by Richard Broun and Richard Sprye . Broun and Sprye intended to use the emerging technology of mechanised land transport to provide a final solution to the problem of London 's dead . They envisaged buying a single very large tract of land around 23 miles ( 37 km ) from London in Brookwood near Woking , Surrey , to be called Brookwood Cemetery or the London Necropolis . At this distance , the land would be far beyond the maximum projected size of the city 's growth , greatly reducing any potential hazards from miasma . In the 18th century this land had been nicknamed " the Waste of Woking " , and with poor quality gravel soil it was of little use in farming and thus available very cheaply . The London and South Western Railway ( LSWR ) — which had connected London to Woking in 1838 — would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply . Broun envisaged dedicated coffin trains , each carrying 50 – 60 bodies , travelling from London to the new Necropolis in the early morning or late at night , and the coffins being stored on the cemetery site until the time of the funeral . Mourners would then be carried to the appropriate part of the cemetery by a dedicated passenger train during the day . 
 Broun calculated that a 1 @,@ 500 @-@ acre ( 2 @.@ 3 sq mi ; 6 @.@ 1 km2 ) site would accommodate a total of 5 @,@ 830 @,@ 500 individual graves in a single layer . The legislation authorising Brookwood Cemetery did not permit mass graves at the site , and burials were restricted to one family per grave . If the practice of only burying a single family in each grave were abandoned and the traditional practice for pauper burials of ten burials per grave were adopted , the site was capable of accommodating 28 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 bodies . Assuming 50 @,@ 000 deaths per year and presuming that families would often choose to share a grave , Broun calculated that even with the prohibition of mass graves it would take over 350 years to fill a single layer of the cemetery . Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London , Broun and Sprye argued that the railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries , all of which required a slow and expensive horse @-@ drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site . 
 = = = Opposition = = = 
 Shareholders in the LSWR were concerned at the impact the cemetery scheme would have on the normal operations of the railway . At a shareholders ' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted . The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators , other than promising them the use of one train each day . Charles Blomfield , Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes , arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service . Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train , and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives . Meanwhile , Henry Drummond , Member of Parliament for the West Surrey constituency which covered the Brookwood site , James Mangles , MP for the nearby constituency of Guildford , and labour reform campaigner Lord Ashley ( later Lord Shaftesbury ) lobbied against the proposal . Drummond considered the scheme a front for land speculation , believing that the promoters only intended to use 400 acres ( 0 @.@ 63 sq mi ; 1 @.@ 6 km2 ) for the cemetery and to develop the remaining 80 % for building ; Mangles felt that the people of Woking were not being fairly compensated for the loss of their historic rights to use the common lands ; Ashley felt that the Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 had been a victory for the campaign to end private profiteering from death and that the new scheme would reverse these gains , and was also concerned about the health implications of diseased bodies being transported to and stored at the London terminus in large numbers while awaiting trains to Brookwood . 
 = = Formation of the London Necropolis Company = = 
 Despite the opposition , on 30 June 1852 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Act 1852 was passed , giving the Brookwood scheme Parliamentary consent to proceed . The former Woking Common at Brookwood , owned by the Earl of Onslow , was chosen as the site for the new cemetery . To prevent the LSWR from exploiting its monopoly on access to the cemetery , the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic , but did not specify details of how the funeral trains were to operate . 
 By this time , Broun and Sprye had lost control of the scheme . On 1 April 1851 a group of trustees led by Poor Law Commissioner William Voules purchased the rights to the scheme from Broun and Sprye for £ 20 @,@ 000 ( about £ 1 @.@ 69 million in terms of 2016 consumer spending power ) and , once the Act of Parliament had been passed , founded the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Company on their own without regard to their agreement with the original promoters . These trustees proved inept , wasting large sums of money ; meanwhile Richard Broun lobbied vigorously against the " misrepresentations and ambiguous assertions " of the new trustees . With financiers sceptical of the scheme 's viability Voules and his trustees were unable to raise the funds to buy the proposed site from Lord Onslow . In early 1853 , amid widespread allegations of voting irregularities and with the company unable to pay promised dividends , a number of the directors resigned , including Voules , and the remaining public confidence in the scheme collapsed . 
 Broun 's scheme had envisaged the cemetery running along both sides of the LSWR main line and divided by religion , with separate private railway halts on the main line , each incorporating a chapel , to serve each religion 's section . The new consulting engineer to the company , William Cubitt , rejected this idea and recommended a single site to the south of the railway line , served by a private branch line through the cemetery . The company also considered Broun 's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic , arguing that relatives would not want the coffins to be shipped separately from the deceased 's family .

 In September 1853 a Committee of Enquiry into the mismanagement of the company recommended the expulsion of the four remaining trustees and the reform of the company under a new board of directors . This was unanimously approved by the shareholders , and work finally began on the scheme . A 2 @,@ 200 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 4 sq mi ; 8 @.@ 9 km2 ) tract of land stretching from Woking to Brookwood was purchased from Lord Onslow . The westernmost 400 acres ( 0 @.@ 62 sq mi ; 1 @.@ 6 km2 ) , at the Brookwood end , were designated the initial cemetery site , and a branch railway line was built from the LSWR main line into this section . A plot of land between Westminster Bridge Road and York Street ( now Leake Street ) was chosen as the site for the London railway terminus . Architect William Tite and engineer William Cubitt drew up a design for a station , which was approved in June 1854 , and completed in October 1854 . In July 1854 work began on the drainage of the marshlands designated as the initial cemetery site , and on the construction of the embankment carrying the railway branch into the cemetery . 
 With the ambition to become London 's sole burial site in perpetuity , the LNC were aware that if their plans were successful , their Necropolis would become a site of major national importance . As a consequence , the cemetery was designed with attractiveness in mind , in contrast to the squalid and congested London burial grounds and the newer suburban cemeteries which were already becoming crowded . The LNC aimed to create an atmosphere of perpetual spring in the cemetery , and chose the plants for the cemetery accordingly . It had already been noted that evergreen plants from North America thrived in the local soil . Robert Donald , the owner of an arboretum near Woking , was contracted to supply the trees and shrubs for the cemetery . The railway line through the cemetery and the major roads and paths within the cemetery were lined with giant sequoia trees , the first significant planting of these trees ( only introduced to Europe in 1853 ) in Britain . As well as the giant sequoias , the grounds were heavily planted with magnolia , rhododendron , coastal redwood , azalea , <unk> and <unk> , with the intention of creating perpetual greenery with large numbers of flowers and a strong floral scent throughout the cemetery . 
 On 7 November 1854 the new cemetery opened and the southern Anglican section was consecrated by Charles Sumner , Bishop of Winchester . At the time it was the largest cemetery in the world . On 13 November the first scheduled train left the new London Necropolis railway station for the cemetery , and the first burial ( that of the stillborn twins of a Mr and Mrs Hore of Ewer Street , Borough ) took place . 
 A very few years ago , the idea of founding a cemetery for the metropolis which should be more than 20 miles distant from it would have been looked upon as an absurdity . Yesterday , however , saw the practical embodiment of this idea … A short distance beyond the Woking station , the country , without varying from its general character of sterility and hardness of outline , becomes gently undulating and offers features which , with some assistance from art , might be made more than pleasing . Here is the London Necropolis , which certainly throws into the shade any previous attempts at extramural interments . 
 It was fitting enough that the largest city in the world should have , as it will now have , the largest cemetery in the world .

 As the Brookwood site had been intentionally chosen for its distance from London , at the time of its opening the only practical way to reach the cemetery was by railway . William Cubitt decided that the terrain of the initial cemetery site was best suited to a railway branch from the LSWR at the west of the cemetery , and work began on the earthworks and rails for the new branch in early September 1854 . The single @-@ track branch was completed in time for the opening two months later . The junction with the LSWR , known as Necropolis Junction , was west @-@ facing , meaning that trains to and from London were obliged to reverse in and out of the branch to the two stations in the cemetery . The poor quality gravel soil , which had been the initial reason for the site 's cheapness and its selection as the site for the cemetery , was poorly suited as a railway trackbed . The rails , and in particular the sleepers , deteriorated rapidly and needed constantly to be replaced .

 A site for the London terminus near Waterloo had been suggested by Richard Broun . Its proximity to the Thames meant that bodies could be cheaply transported to the terminus by water from much of London , while being situated near three major Thames bridges the area was easily accessed from both north and south of the river . The arches of the huge brick viaduct carrying the LSWR into Waterloo Bridge station ( now London Waterloo station ) were easily converted into mortuaries . Broun also felt that the journey out of London from Waterloo Bridge would be less distressing for mourners ; while most of the rail routes out of London ran through tunnels and deep cuttings or through densely populated areas , at this time the urban development of what is now south London had not taken place and the LSWR route ran almost entirely through parkland and countryside . In March 1854 the LNC purchased a plot of land between Westminster Bridge Road and York Street ( now Leake Street ) . Architect William Tite and engineer William Cubitt drew up a design for a station , which was approved in June 1854 and completed in October of that year . 
 As the station abutted the arches of the LSWR 's viaduct , it acted as an obstacle to any increase in the number of lines serving Waterloo station ( renamed from Waterloo Bridge station in 1886 ) . Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London , through which trains from Waterloo ran , led to congestion at the station and in 1896 the LSWR formally presented the LNC with a proposal to provide the LNC with a new station in return for the existing station . The LNC agreed to the proposals , in return for the LSWR granting the LNC control of the design of the new station and leasing the new station to the LNC for a token rent in perpetuity , providing new rolling stock , removing any limit on the number of passengers using the Necropolis service , and providing the free carriage of machinery and equipment to be used in the cemetery . Although the LSWR was extremely unhappy at what they considered excessive demands , in May 1899 the companies signed an agreement , in which the LSWR gave in to every LNC demand . In addition the LSWR paid £ 12 @,@ 000 compensation ( about £ 1 @.@ 22 million in terms of 2016 consumer spending power ) for the inconvenience of relocating the LNC station and offices , and agreed that mourners returning from the cemetery could travel on any LSWR train to Waterloo , Vauxhall or Clapham Junction . A site for the replacement terminus was bought by the LSWR in 1899 , south of the existing site and on the opposite side of Westminster Bridge Road . The new station was completed on 8 February 1902 , and the LSWR viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged Waterloo station , destroying all traces of the original LNC terminus .

 The two stations in the cemetery were very similar in design . North station served the Nonconformist section of the cemetery , and South station served the Anglican section . On William Cubitt 's advice the two stations in the cemetery were built as temporary structures , in the expectation that they would need to be rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer . Other than brick platform faces , chimneys and foundations , the stations were built entirely of wood . Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners , a first class and an ordinary refreshment room , and a set of apartments for LNC staff . To provide an attractive first view of the cemetery for visitors arriving at the stations , the areas around the stations and their associated chapels were planted with groves of bay , Cedar of Lebanon , rhododendron and Portuguese laurel . 
 At the time the cemetery opened , the nearest railway station other than those on the cemetery branch was Woking railway station , 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) away . As only one train per day ran from London to the cemetery stations and back , and even that ran only when funerals were due to take place , access to the cemetery was difficult for mourners and LNC staff . Although in the negotiations leading to the creation of the cemetery the LSWR had told the LNC that they planned to build a main line station near the cemetery , they had not done so . On 1 June 1864 the LSWR finally opened Brookwood railway station on their main line , immediately adjacent to the cemetery . A substantial commuter village grew around the northern ( i.e. non @-@ cemetery ) side of the new station .

 As the corpses brought to either of the reception @-@ houses by the funeral tender are now taken each one its separate way , followed by its mourning @-@ group , and by paths where privacy is unbroken , and none but soothing and religious influences around , — when amidst this scene , the clergyman or minister , <unk> by other duties , reads reverently the prayers for the dead , — when all which is this taking place tends to raise the dignity and self @-@ respect of human nature , and create a sublime ideal of the great mystery of the grave , we perceive by contrast , more and more , what the evils of city and suburban burials have been , and what an educative process lies within even this <unk> one of their reformation … 
 Hither the wealthy and respectable are removing the remains of relatives from the graves and vaults of the metropolis , and hither the Nonconformists are bringing the long @-@ interred dead from even the once @-@ sacred place of <unk> Fields … but it is a law that moral and social advantages permeate as surely down through the strata of society as water finds its level . In spite of little knowledge , in spite of ignorant opposition from those interested in a different state of things , the middle and working classes of the metropolis will not be slow in perceiving the advantages of extramural burial , conjointly with a management that frees them from extortion … 
 To merely provide decency of sepulchre was not , and is not , all . [ The LNC ] perceived that if it was to work out with any efficiency the problem of extramural burial , it must be its own undertaker , and provide a reception @-@ house , as well as railway transit . This it has done accordingly . 
 The London Necropolis Company offered three classes of funerals : 
 A first class funeral allowed its buyer to select the grave site of their choice anywhere in the cemetery ; at the time of opening prices began at £ 2 10s ( about £ 212 in 2016 terms ) for a basic 9 @-@ by @-@ 4 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m × 1 @.@ 2 m ) with no special coffin specifications . It was expected by the LNC that those using first class graves would erect a permanent memorial of some kind in due course following the funeral . 
 Second class funerals cost £ 1 ( about £ 85 in 2016 terms ) and allowed some control over the burial location . The right to erect a permanent memorial cost an additional 10 shillings ( about £ 42 in 2016 terms ) ; if a permanent memorial was not erected the LNC reserved the right to re @-@ use the grave in future . 
 Third class funerals were reserved for pauper funerals ; those buried at parish expense in the section of the cemetery designated for that parish . Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves ( other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave ) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased , third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site . ( The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial , but this practice was rare . ) Despite this , Brookwood 's pauper graves granted more dignity to the deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of the period , all of which other than Brookwood continued the practice of mass graves for the poor . 
 Brookwood was one of the few cemeteries to permit burials on Sundays , which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend funerals without the need to take a day off work . As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time , it also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason , to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance . 
 While the majority of burials conducted by the LNC ( around 80 % ) were pauper funerals on behalf of London parishes , the LNC also reached agreement with a number of societies , guilds , religious bodies and similar organisations . The LNC provided dedicated sections of the cemetery for these groups , on the basis that those who had lived or worked together in life could remain together after death . Although the LNC was never able to gain the domination of London 's funeral industry for which its founders had hoped , it was very successful at targeting specialist groups of artisans and trades , to the extent that it became nicknamed " the Westminster Abbey of the middle classes " . A large number of these dedicated plots were established , ranging from Chelsea Pensioners and the Ancient Order of Foresters to the Corps of Commissionaires and the LSWR . The Nonconformist cemetery also includes a <unk> burial ground established in 1862 , which as of 2011 remains the only Zoroastrian burial ground in Europe . Dedicated sections in the Anglican cemetery were also reserved for burials from those parishes which had made burial arrangements with the LNC . 
 Immediately after its foundation the LNC used existing firms of London undertakers to arrange funerals , but over time took over all aspects of the arrangements from coffin @-@ making to masonry . LNC funerals were intentionally kept as similar as possible to those of traditional undertakers , with the exception that a railway carriage was used in place of a hearse . On being commissioned to provide a funeral , invitations would be sent out either by the deceased 's family or from the LNC offices . These letters specified the waiting room to be used , the time of the train to Brookwood , and the expected return time to London . If the funeral was to be held in London , a traditional hearse and carriage would take the deceased to their parish church for the service , and then on to the London railway terminus ; if the funeral was to take place in the terminus or in Brookwood , the procession would come directly to the terminus . 
 = = = Funerals = = = 
 On arrival at the terminus the mourners would be led either to one of the dedicated first class waiting rooms ( for first and second class funerals ) or to the communal third class waiting room . The coffin would be discreetly unloaded from the hearse and sent to the platform level by lift . Those attending first and second class funerals would be permitted to watch the coffins being loaded onto the train if they so wished . ( After the relocation to the new London terminus in 1902 , some funeral services would be held in a Chapelle Ardente on platform level , for those cases where mourners were unable to make the journey to Brookwood . ) Each door of the waiting train would be labelled with the name of the deceased , to ensure all passengers travelled with the correct funeral party ; the names of the deceased being carried on the train would be called in turn , and that person 's mourners would board the train . 
 At the time the service was inaugurated , the LNC 's trains were divided both by class and by religion , with separate Anglican and Nonconformist sections of the train . This distinction applied to both living and dead passengers . Intended to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment rather than to provide different facilities , the carriages intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design , and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors . 
 At 11 @.@ 35 am ( 11 @.@ 20 am on Sundays ) the train would leave London for Brookwood , arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12 @.@ 25 pm ( 12 @.@ 20 pm on Sundays ) . 
 On arrival at North or South station coffins would usually be unloaded onto a hand @-@ drawn bier and pulled by LNC staff to the appropriate chapel . While this was taking place the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station . On arrival at the chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service ( third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel for all those being buried ) . For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC 's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave . 
 The return trains to London generally left South station at 2 @.@ 15 pm and Necropolis Junction at 2 @.@ 30 pm ; the return journey initially took around an hour owing to the need to stop to refill the engine with water , but following the construction of the water tower in the cemetery this fell to around 40 minutes . An 1854 agreement between the LNC and LSWR gave consent for the LNC to operate two or three funeral trains each day if demand warranted it , but traffic levels never rose to a sufficient level to activate this clause . 
 The train only ran if there was a coffin or passengers at the London terminus waiting to use it , and both the journey from London to Brookwood and the later return would be cancelled if nobody was due to leave London that morning . It would not run if there was only a single third or second class coffin to be carried , and in these cases the coffin and funeral party would be held until the next service . Generally the trains ran direct from London to the cemetery , other than occasional stops to take on water . Between 1890 and 1910 the trains also sometimes stopped at Vauxhall and Clapham Junction for the benefit of mourners from south west London who did not want to travel via Waterloo , but these intermediate stops were discontinued and never reinstated . After 1 October 1900 the Sunday trains were discontinued , and from 1902 the daily train service was ended and trains ran only as required . On some occasions where there were very large numbers of mourners the LSWR would provide special passenger trains from Waterloo to their own station at Brookwood to carry additional mourners to the vicinity of the cemetery . 
 As well as intending to conduct those burials which would previously have taken place in London 's now @-@ closed graveyards , the LNC also envisaged the physical relocation of the closed burial grounds to their Necropolis , to provide a final solution to the problems caused by burials in built @-@ up areas . The massive London civil engineering projects of the mid @-@ 19th century — the railways , the sewer system and from the 1860s the precursors to the London Underground — often necessitated the demolition of existing churchyards . The first major relocation took place in 1862 , when the construction of Charing Cross railway station and the routes into it necessitated the demolition of the burial ground of Cure 's College in Southwark . Around 5 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 3 @,@ 800 m3 ) of earth was displaced , uncovering at least 7 @,@ 950 bodies . These were packed into 220 large containers , each containing 26 adults plus children , and shipped on the London Necropolis Railway to Brookwood for reburial , along with at least some of the existing headstones from the cemetery , at a cost of around 3 shillings per body . At least 21 London burial grounds were relocated to Brookwood via the railway , along with numerous others relocated by road following the railway 's closure . The LNC 's exhumation and relocation business , split from the LNC in 1973 and renamed " Necropolis " , continued to operate until 2002 . 
 = = Developments and difficulties = = 
 The success of the LNC relied on taking over all , or at least a significant portion , of the burials of London 's dead . However , while the Metropolitan Interment Amendment Act 1852 had repealed Chadwick 's scheme for two very large cemeteries near London , it had also permitted London 's parishes to make their own arrangements for the burial of their dead . Each parish could make arrangements with the cemetery of its choosing , or use money from the rates to create their own cemeteries . The financial mismanagement and internal disputes within the LNC had delayed the opening of Brookwood Cemetery by 18 months , and during this period new cemeteries nearer London had opened or were nearing completion . While some parishes did choose Brookwood as their burial site , many preferred either to make arrangements with less distant cemeteries , or to buy land on the outskirts of London and open their own suburban cemeteries . Concerns over the financial irregularities and the viability of the scheme had led to only 15 @,@ 000 of the 25 @,@ 000 LNC shares being sold , severely limiting the company 's working capital and forcing it to take out large loans . Buying the land from Lord Onslow , compensating local residents for the loss of rights over Woking Common , draining and landscaping the portion to be used for the initial cemetery , and building the railway lines and stations were all expensive undertakings . With far fewer burial contracts with London parishes than had been anticipated , by the time Brookwood Cemetery opened in November 1854 the LNC was on the verge of bankruptcy . 
 Recognising their financial predicament , the LNC lobbied Parliament for a new Act of Parliament to allow the venture to survive . On 23 July 1855 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Amendment Act 1855 received Royal Assent . This Act released the LNC from those compulsory purchases of land which had been mandated by the 1852 Act but had not yet been completed , easing the immediate financial burden . It also allowed a ten @-@ year window for the LNC to sell certain parts of the land bought from Lord Onslow which were not required for the cemetery , to provide a source of income . 
 Although the 1855 Act permitted the LNC to sell land , this proved difficult . Of the 2 @,@ 200 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 4 sq mi ; 8 @.@ 9 km2 ) site , around 700 acres ( 1 @.@ 1 sq mi ; 2 @.@ 8 km2 ) were occupied by the initial Necropolis site and the adjacent reserve site , and a further 200 acres ( 0 @.@ 31 sq mi ; 0 @.@ 81 km2 ) retained their common land rights and could not be developed in any way , rendering them worthless to prospective buyers . While this left 1 @,@ 300 acres ( 2 @.@ 0 sq mi ; 5 @.@ 3 km2 ) theoretically able to be sold , the Brookwood site had been chosen for its remoteness and there were few prospective buyers . While 214 acres ( 0 @.@ 33 sq mi ; 0 @.@ 87 km2 ) were bought by the government as sites for prisons and a lunatic asylum , the LNC struggled to sell the remainder . By the time the ten @-@ year window for land sales expired in 1865 , only 346 acres ( 0 @.@ 54 sq mi ; 1 @.@ 4 km2 ) had been sold . 
 With the majority of the surplus lands still unsold , as the ten @-@ year window expired the LNC successfully petitioned for a further five @-@ year extension . The LNC was by this time in serious financial difficulties , and dependent on loans from its own directors to settle outstanding debts . The business had been established on the basis that the cemetery would handle between 10 @,@ 000 and 50 @,@ 000 burials per year , but the number never exceeded 4 @,@ 100 and over its first 20 years of operations averaged just 3 @,@ 200 . As the five @-@ year extension expired the financial difficulties remained , and under pressure from shareholders the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Amendment Act 1869 was passed . This removed all restrictions on land sales , other than within the existing cemetery and the adjacent reserve site . Despite the releasing of restrictions in the 1869 Act , land sales remained disappointing . By 1887 less than half the surplus land had been sold , much of it at very low prices . 
 = = = Cremation = = = 
 In 1878 the Cremation Society of Great Britain bought an isolated piece of the LNC 's Brookwood land and built Woking Crematorium on the site . The crematorium was completed in 1879 but Richard Cross , the Home Secretary , bowed to strong protests from local residents and threatened to prosecute if any cremations were conducted . As a consequence the crematorium was not used other than for the experimental incineration of livestock . The 1884 trial of William Price established that human cremation was not unlawful in England , and on 26 March 1885 the first human cremation took place at Woking . Although the LNC was hostile to the idea of cremation , Woking Crematorium was the only operational crematorium in the country . Since the Necropolis Railway provided the easiest way to transport bodies and mourners from London to the Woking area , transport to and from Woking Crematorium soon began to provide a significant source of revenue for the LNC . 
 Cremation remained unusual and very expensive ; the cost of a cremation at Woking was £ 6 , not including transport and funeral costs , more than twice the £ 2 10s cost of a first class burial at Brookwood . By 1891 only 177 people had been cremated at Woking . Cyril Tubbs recognised that a potential increase in cremations once the practice became accepted represented an opportunity for the LNC . In July 1891 he proposed that the LNC build its own crematorium and columbarium ( building for the storage of cremated remains ) within the cemetery , with the ultimate goal of taking over all funeral arrangements for the Cremation Society . The Cremation Society were keen to prevent a competitor to Woking Crematorium , and sought to cooperate with the LNC . The fares for the transport of mourners and coffins on the London Necropolis Railway had been fixed by Parliament in 1852 at 6s for a living first class passenger and £ 1 for a first class coffin ( in 1891 worth about £ 30 and £ 98 respectively in 2016 consumer terms ) . Rival firms of undertakers were not permitted to use the LNC 's trains to Brookwood Cemetery and had to pay the much more expensive LSWR fares to transport coffins and mourners from Waterloo to Woking , giving the LNC a significant advantage in carriage to the crematorium . While the LNC never built its own crematorium , in 1910 Lord Cadogan decided he no longer wanted to be interred in the mausoleum he had commissioned at Brookwood . This building , the largest mausoleum in the cemetery , was bought by the LNC , fitted with shelves and niches to hold urns , and used as a dedicated columbarium from then on . 
 = = = Cyril Tubbs = = = 
 In December 1887 the LNC appointed Cyril Tubbs to supervise the LNC estate . Tubbs was given a broad remit to " advance the company 's interests " , including buying and selling land , supervising the railway stations , advertising the cemetery and liaising with the LSWR . Tubbs set about restructuring the design of Brookwood Cemetery to make it more appealing to mourners and visitors . The cemetery was divided into numbered sections , separated by an expanded network of avenues . These avenues were all named , and signposts were erected along them , to allow visitors easily to find their way around the sprawling Brookwood site , and to locate particular graves ; the naming and numbering system devised by Tubbs has remained in use ever since . 
 Tubbs established a masonry works and showroom near the centre of the cemetery , allowing the LNC to provide grave markers without the difficulty of shipping them from London , and opened a LNC @-@ owned nursery in the grounds for the sale of plants and wreaths . This increased the practice of mourners planting flowers and shrubs around graves , which was in turn used by the LNC in their promotional material to promote Brookwood as a " Garden of Sleep " . In around 1904 the masonry works was expanded and equipped with a siding from the railway branch line , allowing the LNC to sell its gravestones and funerary art to cemeteries nationwide . 
 Tubbs also oversaw a restructuring of the ailing programme to sell the LNC 's surplus lands . The estate was partitioned into three sections , and separate estate agents appointed to oversee the disposal of each . Many of the lands near Woking railway station and around Brookwood were sold , at much higher prices than the LNC disposals had previously fetched . No suitable agent could be found to oversee the sale of the third portion of LNC land , Hook Heath , and as a consequence Tubbs kept it under LNC control and oversaw its development himself . Over the 1890s the site was subdivided into plots for large detached houses , and a golf course was built to attract residents and visitors . 
 In August 1914 , on the outbreak of the First World War , the LNC offered to donate to the War Office 1 acre ( 4 @,@ 000 m2 ) of land " for the free interment of soldiers and sailors who have returned from the front wounded and may subsequently die " . The offer was not taken up until 1917 , when a section of the cemetery was set aside as Brookwood Military Cemetery , used for the burials of service personnel who died in the London District . In 1921 this area was sold to the Imperial War Graves Commission ( later the Commonwealth War Graves Commission ) , and since then the military cemeteries have been administered and maintained by the IWGC / CWGC and its equivalents for other nations whose military are buried there . In September 1922 the LNC sold an area adjacent to the Military Cemetery to the US government . The LNC was hired by the US government to landscape this area and build a chapel , creating the American Military Cemetery ( later the Brookwood American Cemetery and Memorial ) , the only burial ground in Britain for US casualties of the First World War . Although built by the LNC , since 1923 the American Military Cemetery has been administered by the American Battle Monuments Commission . After the Second World War the military cemeteries were extended to include dedicated sections for many of the Allied nations , and in 1958 the Brookwood Memorial , commemorating 3 @,@ 500 Commonwealth casualties of the Second World War with no known grave , was dedicated at the site . Between them , the military cemeteries occupy around 37 acres ( 150 @,@ 000 m2 ) of the site . 
 = = Closure of the London Necropolis Railway = = 
 On 13 April 1927 Cyril Tubbs died , after almost 40 years as surveyor , general manager and later a director of the LNC . Shortly afterwards , during meetings of the LNC 's shareholders on 16 June and 14 July 1927 , the words " National Mausoleum " were formally dropped from the LNC 's name , the company being officially renamed the London Necropolis Company . On 28 December 1927 George Barratt , who had worked for the LNC for 63 years and been Superintendent of Brookwood Cemetery for 41 years , also died . Although the number of burials was gradually declining , it remained relatively steady . However , by this time mechanical hearses had begun to affect the numbers of people using the London Necropolis Railway . Trains still ran to the cemetery when there was demand , but the service which had previously operated almost every day was now generally only running around twice a week . By now the trees planted by the LNC in its early years of operations were mature , and Brookwood Cemetery was becoming a tourist attraction in its own right , often featuring in excursion guides of the 1920s and 1930s . 
 During the Second World War Waterloo station and the nearby Thames bridges were a significant target for bombing , and there were several near @-@ misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940 – 41 . Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line , the Necropolis station was undamaged during the early stages of the bombing campaign . During the night of 16 – 17 April 1941 , in one of the last major air raids on London , this good fortune came to an end . As bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area , the rolling stock parked in the Necropolis siding was burned , and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was badly damaged . Multiple incendiary devices and high explosive bombs struck the central section of the terminus building . While the LNC 's office building and the station platforms survived , the central section of the station was reduced to rubble . On 11 May 1941 the station was officially declared closed . 
 The Southern Railway ( SR ) , which had absorbed the LSWR in 1923 , offered the LNC the temporary use of Waterloo station to allow the Necropolis Railway service to be continued , but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling to and from the cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day , meaning those visiting the cemetery had little reason to choose the LNC 's irregular and infrequent trains to the cemetery stations over the SR 's fast and frequent services to Brookwood . The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which genuine mourners could still travel cheaply to the cemetery on the 11 @.@ 57 am service to Brookwood ( the SR service closest to the LNC 's traditional departure time ) , but the SR management ( themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage ) refused to entertain any compromise . In September 1945 , following the end of hostilities , the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway . Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition , the branch line from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus . With the soil of the cemetery causing the branch to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained , the branch line was in extremely poor condition . 
 Although Richard Broun had calculated that over its first century of operations the cemetery would have seen around five million burials at a rate of 50 @,@ 000 per year , at the time the last train ran on 11 April 1941 only 203 @,@ 041 people had been buried at Brookwood in almost 87 years of operations . Increased use of motorised road transport had damaged the profitability of the railway for the LNC , and faced with the costs of rebuilding the cemetery branch line , building a new London terminus and replacing the rolling stock damaged or destroyed in the air raid , the directors concluded that " past experience and present changed conditions made the running of the Necropolis private train obsolete " . In mid @-@ 1946 the LNC formally informed the SR that the Westminster Bridge Road terminus would not be reopened . 
 The decision prompted complicated negotiations with the SR over the future of the LNC facilities in London . In December 1946 the directors of the two companies finally reached agreement . The railway @-@ related portions of the LNC site ( the waiting rooms , the caretaker 's flat and the platforms themselves ) would pass into the direct ownership of the SR , while the remaining surviving portions of the site ( the office block on Westminster Bridge Road , the driveway and the ruined central portion of the site ) would pass to the LNC to use or dispose of as they saw fit . The LNC sold the site to the British Humane Association in May 1947 for £ 21 @,@ 000 ( about £ 741 @,@ 000 in terms of 2016 consumer spending power ) , and the offices of the LNC were transferred to the Superintendent 's Office at Brookwood . The SR continued to use the surviving sections of the track as occasional sidings into the 1950s , before clearing what remained of their section of the site . 
 While most of the LNC 's business was now operated by road , an agreement on 13 May 1946 allowed the LNC to make use of SR services from Waterloo to Brookwood station for funerals , subject to the condition that should the service be heavily used the SR ( British Railways after 1948 ) reserved the right to restrict the number of funeral parties on any given train . Although one of the LNC 's hearse carriages had survived the bombing it is unlikely that this was ever used , and coffins were carried in the luggage space of the SR 's coaches . Coffins would either be shipped to Brookwood ahead of the funeral party and transported by road to one of the mortuaries at the disused cemetery stations , or travel on the same SR train as the funeral party to Brookwood and be transported from Brookwood station to the burial site or chapel by road . 
 Although the LNC proposed to convert the cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery , this never took place . The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947 , and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath . The run @-@ around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings , before being dismantled on 30 November 1964 . After the closure of the branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks , and were renamed North Bar and South Bar . On the retirement in 1956 of a Mr and Mrs Dendy , who operated North Bar from 1948 to 1956 and lived in the station apartment , North station was abandoned , and demolished in the 1960s owing to dry rot . South Bar continued to operate as a refreshment kiosk .

 After 1945 cremation , up to that time an uncommon practice , became increasingly popular in Britain . In 1946 the LNC obtained consent to build their own crematorium on a section of the Nonconformist cemetery which had been set aside for pauper burials , but chose not to proceed . Instead , in 1945 the LNC began the construction of the Glades of Remembrance , a wooded area dedicated to the burial of cremated remains . These were dedicated by Henry Campbell , Bishop of Guildford in 1950 . Intentionally designed for informality , traditional gravestones and memorials were prohibited , and burials were marked only by small 2 @-@ to @-@ 3 @-@ inch ( 5 @.@ 1 to 7 @.@ 6 cm ) stones . 
 Although at its founding the LNC had hoped to handle 50 @,@ 000 burials per year and even without being granted a monopoly on London burials had planned for 10 @,@ 000 per year , Brookwood Cemetery was never as popular as hoped . At the time of the railway 's closure only 203 @,@ 041 burials had been conducted , and the rate was steadily falling ; on the LNC 's 150th anniversary in November 1994 , a total of 231 @,@ 730 burials had been conducted . Even with the unusually large individual 9 @-@ by @-@ 4 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m × 1 @.@ 2 m ) grave sites offered by the LNC for even the cheapest burials , the site had been planned to accommodate 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 burials , and much of the land was empty . 
 Despite the decline in burials from an already low level , rising land values in the post war years meant that the LNC was a valuable and successful company . In the 1940s it bought out a number of other firms of funeral directors , particularly those catering for the expanding and prosperous suburbs of south west London within easy reach of Brookwood by road . The LNC continued to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s on the matter of cheap fares for visitors to the cemetery , but were unable to come to any agreement . In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s 6d ( compared to the standard rate of 9s 4d ) for return tickets for same @-@ day travel from London to Brookwood and back . By this time most visitors to the cemetery were travelling by road . The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the fares would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to the railway , and the proposal was abandoned . 
 Owing to Henry Drummond 's concerns in 1852 that the LNC was a front for land speculation , the sale of LNC @-@ owned land for building had been expressly forbidden by the Act of Parliament establishing the LNC , and consequently much of the land not in use for burials remained undeveloped , aside from the land sold in the 1850s and 1860s , and the areas sold by Cyril Tubbs . 
 By the 1950s , with the area around Woking by this time heavily populated , rental income from the LNC 's land holdings was an extremely valuable asset , and in May 1955 the Alliance Property Company launched a hostile takeover bid with the aim of using the cemetery 's land for property development . The bid failed , but prompted the LNC to secure the passing of the London Necropolis Act 1956 , allowing the sale of all remaining surplus land . A new company , the Brookwood Estates Realisation Company , was founded to oversee the disposal of the remaining unsold lands as well as the cemetery reserve , finally formally recognising that Brookwood Cemetery would never expand beyond its original boundaries . 
 The former South station was near the <unk> road making it one of the most easily accessed parts of the cemetery once the railway had closed , and the land surrounding it was now redundant . As part of the London Necropolis Act 1956 the LNC obtained Parliamentary consent to convert the disused Anglican chapel of 1854 into a crematorium , using a newer chapel built by Cyril Tubbs in 1908 – 09 for funeral services and the station building for coffin storage and as a refreshment room for those attending cremations . Suffering cash flow problems and distracted by the hostile takeover bid , the LNC management never proceeded with the scheme . 
 Repeated takeover bids from various companies were unsuccessfully attempted in 1956 and 1957 , until in December 1957 Alliance Property announced that it controlled a majority of the shares of the Brookwood Estates Realisation Company . In January 1959 Alliance Property announced the successful takeover of the London Necropolis Company itself , bringing over a century of independence to an end . 
 = = = After the takeover = = = 
 Historically the LNC had invested much of its income from burials and fares , and used the dividends from these investments to pay for cemetery upkeep . Although Alliance Property kept the name " London Necropolis Company " for its funeral business , it was a property developer with no interest in the funeral industry , and saw little reason to spend large amounts maintaining the cemetery , proceeding with the proposed crematorium , or promoting new burials of bodies or cremated remains . The rising popularity of cremation meant the rate of burials was at a historic low , while the Victorian character of the cemetery had fallen out of fashion . The income from burials was insufficient to maintain the cemetery grounds , and the cemetery began to revert to wilderness . Over the course of the 1960s most undertaking work at Brookwood came to an end . 
 After Alliance Property 's land sales , the London Necropolis Company had been reduced to Brookwood Cemetery itself and Frederick W. Paine , a Kingston @-@ upon @-@ Thames firm of funeral directors which had been bought by the LNC in 1947 . In 1970 Alliance Property sold the LNC to Cornwall Property ( Holdings ) Ltd . The following year Cornwall Property sold it on to the Great Southern Group , the owners of Streatham Park Cemetery , South London Crematorium and a chain of funeral directors in central London . 
 The Great Southern Group dismantled much of what remained of the company . Frederick W. Paine was detached from the LNC , along with the specialist division overseeing the exhumation and relocation of existing burial grounds to allow property development on formerly consecrated sites . All that remained of the LNC was Brookwood Cemetery itself , by this time moribund and becoming heavily overgrown . Considered virtually worthless , Great Southern sold the LNC to property speculators Maximillian Investments in July 1973 for £ 400 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 As Alliance Property and the Great Southern Group had between them stripped all assets other than the cemetery itself and development within the cemetery was prohibited , the LNC had little apparent value . However , Maximilian Investments secured passage of the Brookwood Cemetery Act 1975 , authorising them to sell land within the operational area of the cemetery . The former Superintendent 's office housing the LNC 's offices , near the level crossing where the Necropolis Railway had passed between the northern and southern cemeteries , was sold for office development . Following the sale the offices of the LNC , renamed Brookwood Cemetery Ltd at this time , were moved into a small former caretaker 's lodge . With little storage space in the new makeshift offices , the majority of the LNC 's records were destroyed during the move . Tracts of land within the cemetery were sold to various religious groups and to wealthy families for use as private burial grounds , and a tract of unused land south of the Glades of Remembrance was sold to Woking Clay Pigeon Club . The masonry works remained operational until the early 1980s , although not under LNC management after the early 1960s , and were then converted into office buildings and named <unk> 's Court . 
 Although the Act of 1975 had specified that a portion of the profits from land sales be used to maintain the remaining cemetery , little restoration work was done and the cemetery continued to revert to wilderness . With the new owners of the land interested only in redeveloping those parts of the cemetery not currently in use , the cemetery itself sank further into neglect . 
 The last operators of the refreshment kiosk in the former South station retired in the late 1960s and from then on the station building was used as a cemetery storeroom . Around half the building was destroyed by fire in September 1972 . The building was popular with railway and architectural enthusiasts as a distinctive piece of Victorian railway architecture , but despite a lobbying campaign to preserve the surviving sections of the station the remaining buildings ( other than the platform itself ) were demolished shortly afterwards . By the time of its demolition the " temporary " structure was 118 years old . In 1982 as part of the programme of land sales the station site , the two derelict Anglican chapels and 5 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 m2 ) of land around it were sold to the St. Edward Brotherhood , an order of Russian Orthodox monks . The Brotherhood set about restoring the chapels for religious use . The original 1854 chapel is used as a visitor 's centre and living quarters for the monastery , while the larger Anglican chapel built by Cyril Tubbs in 1908 – 09 immediately north of the station is now the Russian Orthodox Church of St. Edward the Martyr , and houses the relics and shrine of Edward the Martyr , king of England from 975 – 978 AD . The main monastery has been built on the site of the former station building , while the platform itself remains intact and now marks the boundary of the monastic enclosure . 
 In March 1985 the company was bought by Ramadan Güney , whose family owned the cemetery until it was purchased by Woking Borough Council in December 2014 . The Guney family embarked on a programme of building links with London 's mosques to encourage new burials in the cemetery . Guney began a slow programme of clearing the overgrown sections of the cemetery and restoring significant memorials . The Guney family 's efforts to attract new custom have been successful , to the extent that some of the lands sold off in the 1970s have now been repurchased by the cemetery . In June 1989 the cemetery was designated a Conservation Area , and was subsequently declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest . In 1992 the Brookwood Cemetery Society was formed to improve awareness of the cemetery ; the Society holds open days , guided walks and other events , restores damaged memorials , and maintains and improves the signage within the <unk> is with these intentions that Woking Borough Council agreed at a Special Council Meeting on 24 November 2014 that it should secure the Cemetery by establishing Woking Necropolis and Mausoleum Limited , as a subsidiary within its <unk> Group of companies . 
 While it was never as successful as planned , the London Necropolis Company had a significant impact on the funeral industry , and the principles established by the LNC influenced the design of many other cemeteries worldwide . The village of Brookwood has grown on the northern ( non @-@ cemetery ) side of the LSWR railway line , focused on the 1864 railway station which remains heavily used both by commuters and by visitors to the cemetery . Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom and one of the largest in the world . Although not the world 's only dedicated funeral railway line , the London Necropolis Railway was the first , the longest lasting and by far the best known . While the growth of the part of Surrey around the cemetery was heavily influenced by the LNC , some iron columns in Newnham Terrace SW1 which once supported the Necropolis Railway viaduct and the LNC 's surviving office building at 121 Westminster Bridge Road are the only surviving London Necropolis Company structures in London itself . 
 = Milky Way = 
 The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System . Its name " milky " is derived from its appearance as a dim glowing band arching across the night sky whose individual stars cannot be distinguished by the naked eye . The term " Milky Way " is a translation of the Latin via lactea , from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος ( <unk> <unk> , " milky circle " ) . From Earth , the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk @-@ shaped structure is viewed from within . Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610 . Until the early 1920s , most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe . Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis , observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies — now estimated to number as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe . 
 The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy that has a diameter usually considered to be about 100 @,@ 000 – 120 @,@ 000 light @-@ years but may be 150 @,@ 000 – 180 @,@ 000 light @-@ years . The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100 – 400 billion stars , although this number may be as high as one trillion . There are likely at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way . The Solar System is located within the disk , about 27 @,@ 000 light @-@ years from the Galactic Center , on the inner edge of one of the spiral @-@ shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm . The stars in the inner ≈ 10 @,@ 000 light @-@ years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge . The very center is marked by an intense radio source , named Sagittarius A * , which is likely to be a supermassive black hole . 
 Stars and gases at a wide range of distances from the Galactic Center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per second . The constant rotation speed contradicts the laws of Keplerian dynamics and suggests that much of the mass of the Milky Way does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation . This mass has been termed " dark matter " . The rotational period is about 240 million years at the position of the Sun . The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference . The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus likely formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang . 
 The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies , which is a component of the Virgo Supercluster , which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster . 
 = = Appearance = = 
 The " Milky Way " can be seen as a hazy band of white light some 30 degrees wide arcing across the sky . Although all the individual naked @-@ eye stars in the entire sky are part of the Milky Way , the light in this band originates from the accumulation of unresolved stars and other material located in the direction of the galactic plane . Dark regions within the band , such as the Great Rift and the <unk> , are areas where light from distant stars is blocked by interstellar dust . The area of the sky obscured by the Milky Way is called the Zone of Avoidance . 
 The Milky Way has a relatively low surface brightness . Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon . The sky needs to be darker than about 20 @.@ 2 magnitude per square arcsecond in order for the Milky Way to be seen . It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately + 5 @.@ 1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at + 6 @.@ 1 . This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location , but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon . The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one third of Earth population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution . 
 As viewed from Earth , the visible region of the Milky Way 's Galactic plane occupies an area of the sky that includes 30 constellations . The center of the Galaxy lies in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius ; it is here that the Milky Way is brightest . From Sagittarius , the hazy band of white light appears to pass around to the Galactic anticenter in Auriga . The band then continues the rest of the way around the sky , back to Sagittarius . The band divides the night sky into two roughly equal hemispheres . 
 The Galactic plane is inclined by about 60 degrees to the ecliptic ( the plane of Earth 's orbit ) . Relative to the celestial equator , it passes as far north as the constellation of Cassiopeia and as far south as the constellation of Crux , indicating the high inclination of Earth ’ s equatorial plane and the plane of the ecliptic , relative to the Galactic plane . The north Galactic pole is situated at right ascension <unk> 49m , declination + 27 @.@ 4 ° ( <unk> ) near β <unk> Berenices , and the south Galactic pole is near α <unk> . Because of this high inclination , depending on the time of night and year , the arc of Milky Way may appear relatively low or relatively high in the sky . For observers from approximately 65 degrees north to 65 degrees south on Earth 's surface , the Milky Way passes directly overhead twice a day . 
 = = Size and mass = = 
 The Milky Way is the second @-@ largest galaxy in the Local Group , with its stellar disk approximately 100 @,@ 000 ly ( 30 kpc ) in diameter , and , on average , approximately 1 @,@ 000 ly ( 0 @.@ 3 kpc ) thick . As a guide to the relative physical scale of the Milky Way , if the Solar System out to Neptune were the size of a US quarter ( 25mm ) , the Milky Way would be approximately the size of the continental United States . A ring @-@ like filament of stars wrapping around the Milky Way may actually belong to the Milky Way itself , rippling above and below the relatively flat galactic plane . If so , that would mean a diameter of 150 @,@ 000 – 180 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 46 – 55 kpc ) . 
 Estimates of the mass of the Milky Way vary , depending upon the method and data used . At the low end of the estimate range , the mass of the Milky Way is 5 @.@ 8 × 1011 solar masses ( M ☉ ) , somewhat less than that of the Andromeda Galaxy . Measurements using the Very Long Baseline Array in 2009 found velocities as large as 254 km / s for stars at the outer edge of the Milky Way . Because the orbital velocity depends on the total mass inside the orbital radius , this suggests that the Milky Way is more massive , roughly equaling the mass of Andromeda Galaxy at 7 × 1011 M ☉ within 160 @,@ 000 ly ( 49 kpc ) of its center . In 2010 , a measurement of the radial velocity of halo stars finds that the mass enclosed within 80 kiloparsecs is 7 × 1011 M ☉ . According to a study published in 2014 , the mass of the entire Milky Way is estimated to be 8 @.@ 5 × 1011 M ☉ , which is about half the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy . 
 Most of the mass of the Milky Way appears to be dark matter , an unknown and invisible form of matter that interacts gravitationally with ordinary matter . A dark matter halo is spread out relatively uniformly to a distance beyond one hundred kiloparsecs from the Galactic Center . Mathematical models of the Milky Way suggest that its total mass is 1 – 1 @.@ 5 × 1012 M ☉ . More @-@ recent studies indicate a mass as large as 4 @.@ 5 × 1012 M ☉ and as small as 0 @.@ 8 × 1012 M ☉ . 
 The total mass of all the stars in the Milky Way is estimated to be between 4 @.@ 6 × 1010 M ☉ and 6 @.@ 43 × 1010 M ☉ . In addition to the stars , there is also interstellar gas , comprising 90 % hydrogen and 10 % helium by mass , with two thirds of the hydrogen found in the form of atomic form and the remaining one third as molecular hydrogen . The mass of this gas is equal to between 10 % and 15 % of the total mass of the galaxy 's stars . Interstellar dust accounts for an additional 1 % of the total mass of the gas . 
 = = Contents = = 
 The Milky Way contains between 200 and 400 billion stars and at least 100 billion planets . The exact figure depends on the number of very @-@ low @-@ mass stars , which are hard to detect , especially at distances of more than 300 ly ( 90 pc ) from the Sun . As a comparison , the neighboring Andromeda Galaxy contains an estimated one trillion ( 1012 ) stars . Filling the space between the stars is a disk of gas and dust called the interstellar medium . This disk has at least a comparable extent in radius to the stars , whereas the thickness of the gas layer ranges from hundreds of light years for the colder gas to thousands of light years for warmer gas . 
 The disk of stars in the Milky Way does not have a sharp edge beyond which there are no stars . Rather , the concentration of stars decreases with distance from the center of the Milky Way . For reasons that are not understood , beyond a radius of roughly 40 @,@ 000 ly ( 13 kpc ) from the center , the number of stars per cubic parsec drops much faster with radius . Surrounding the galactic disk is a spherical Galactic Halo of stars and globular clusters that extends further outward but is limited in size by the orbits of two Milky Way satellites , the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds , whose closest approach to the Galactic Center is about 180 @,@ 000 ly ( 55 kpc ) . At this distance or beyond , the orbits of most halo objects would be disrupted by the Magellanic Clouds . Hence , such objects would probably be ejected from the vicinity of the Milky Way . The integrated absolute visual magnitude of the Milky Way is estimated to be around − 20 @.@ 9 . 
 Both gravitational microlensing and planetary transit observations indicate that there may be at least as many planets bound to stars as there are stars in the Milky Way , and microlensing measurements indicate that there are more rogue planets not bound to host stars than there are stars . The Milky Way contains at least one planet per star , resulting in 100 – 400 billion planets , according to a January 2013 study of the five @-@ planet star system Kepler @-@ 32 with the Kepler space observatory . A different January 2013 analysis of Kepler data estimated that at least 17 billion Earth @-@ sized exoplanets reside in the Milky Way . On November 4 , 2013 , astronomers reported , based on Kepler space mission data , that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth @-@ sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun @-@ like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way . 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting Sun @-@ like stars . The nearest such planet may be 12 light @-@ years away , according to scientists . Such Earth @-@ sized planets may be more numerous than gas giants . Besides exoplanets , " <unk> " , comets beyond the Solar System , have also been detected and may be common in the Milky Way . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The Milky Way consists of a bar @-@ shaped core region surrounded by a disk of gas , dust and stars . The gas , dust and stars are organized in roughly logarithmic spiral arm structures ( see Spiral arms below ) . The mass distribution within the Milky Way closely resembles the type <unk> in the Hubble classification , which represents spiral galaxies with relatively loosely wound arms . Astronomers first began to suspect that the Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy , rather than an ordinary spiral galaxy , in the 1990s . Their suspicions were confirmed by the Spitzer Space Telescope observations in 2005 that showed the Milky Way 's central bar to be larger than previously thought . 
 = = = Galactic quadrants = = = 
 A galactic quadrant , or quadrant of the Milky Way , refers to one of four circular sectors in the division of the Milky Way . In actual astronomical practice , the delineation of the galactic quadrants is based upon the galactic coordinate system , which places the Sun as the origin of the mapping system . 
 Quadrants are described using ordinals — for example , " 1st galactic quadrant " , " second galactic quadrant " , or " third quadrant of the Milky Way " . Viewing from the north galactic pole with 0 degrees ( ° ) as the ray that runs starting from the Sun and through the Galactic Center , the quadrants are as follows : 
 1st galactic quadrant – 0 ° ≤ longitude ( ℓ ) ≤ 90 ° 
 2nd galactic quadrant – 90 ° ≤ ℓ ≤ 180 ° 
 3rd galactic quadrant – 180 ° ≤ ℓ ≤ 270 ° 
 4th galactic quadrant – 270 ° ≤ ℓ ≤ 360 ° ( 0 ° ) 
 = = = Galactic Center = = = 
 The Sun is 26 @,@ 000 – 28 @,@ 000 ly ( 8 @.@ 0 – 8 @.@ 6 kpc ) from the Galactic Center . This value is estimated using geometric @-@ based methods or by measuring selected astronomical objects that serve as standard candles , with different techniques yielding various values within this approximate range . In the inner few kpc ( around 10 @,@ 000 light @-@ years radius ) is a dense concentration of mostly old stars in a roughly spheroidal shape called the bulge . It has been proposed that the Milky Way lacks a bulge formed due to a collision and merger between previous galaxies and that instead has a <unk> formed by its central bar . 
 The Galactic Center is marked by an intense radio source named Sagittarius A * ( pronounced Sagittarius A @-@ star ) . The motion of material around the center indicates that Sagittarius A * harbors a massive , compact object . This concentration of mass is best explained as a supermassive black hole ( SMBH ) with an estimated mass of 4 @.@ 1 – 4 @.@ 5 million times the mass of the Sun . The rate of accretion of the SMBH is consistent with an inactive galactic nucleus , being estimated at around 1 × 10 − 5 M ☉ y − 1 . Observations indicate that there are SMBH located near the center of most normal galaxies . 
 The nature of the Milky Way 's bar is actively debated , with estimates for its half @-@ length and orientation spanning from 1 to 5 kpc ( 3 @,@ 000 – 16 @,@ 000 ly ) and 10 – 50 degrees relative to the line of sight from Earth to the Galactic Center . Certain authors advocate that the Milky Way features two distinct bars , one nestled within the other . However , RR <unk> variables do not trace a prominent Galactic bar . The bar may be surrounded by a ring called the " 5 @-@ kpc ring " that contains a large fraction of the molecular hydrogen present in the Milky Way , as well as most of the Milky Way 's star @-@ formation activity . Viewed from the Andromeda Galaxy , it would be the brightest feature of the Milky Way . X @-@ ray emission from the core is aligned with the massive stars surrounding the central bar and the Galactic ridge . 
 In 2010 , two gigantic spherical bubbles of high energy emission were detected to the north and the south of the Milky Way core , using data of the Fermi Gamma @-@ ray Space Telescope . The diameter of each of the bubbles is about 25 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 7 @.@ 7 kpc ) ; they stretch up to Grus and to Virgo on the night @-@ sky of the southern hemisphere . Subsequently , observations with the Parkes Telescope at radio frequencies identified polarized emission that is associated with the Fermi bubbles . These observations are best interpreted as a magnetized outflow driven by star formation in the central 640 ly ( 200 pc ) of the Milky Way . 
 Later , on January 5 , 2015 , NASA reported observing an X @-@ ray flare 400 times brighter than usual , a record @-@ breaker , from Sagittarius A * , a black hole in the center of the Milky Way . The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius A * , according to astronomers . 
 = = = Spiral arms = = = 
 Outside the gravitational influence of the Galactic bars , astronomers generally organize the structure of the interstellar medium and stars in the disk of the Milky Way into four spiral arms . Spiral arms typically contain a higher density of interstellar gas and dust than the Galactic average as well as a greater concentration of star formation , as traced by H II regions and molecular clouds . 
 The Milky Way 's spiral structure is uncertain and there is currently no consensus on the nature of the Milky Way 's spiral arms . Perfect logarithmic spiral patterns only crudely describe features near the Sun , because galaxies commonly have arms that branch , merge , twist unexpectedly , and feature a degree of irregularity . The possible scenario of the Sun within a spur / Local arm emphasizes that point and indicates that such features are probably not unique , and exist elsewhere in the Milky Way . 
 As in most spiral galaxies , each spiral arm can be described as a logarithmic spiral . Estimates of the pitch angle of the arms range from about 7 ° to 25 ° . There are thought to be four spiral arms that all start near the Milky Way 's center . These are named as follows , with the positions of the arms shown in the image at right : 
 Two spiral arms , the Scutum – Centaurus arm and the Carina – Sagittarius arm , have tangent points inside the Sun 's orbit about the center of the Milky Way . If these arms contain an overdensity of stars compared to the average density of stars in the Galactic disk , it would be detectable by counting the stars near the tangent point . Two surveys of near @-@ infrared light , which is sensitive primarily to red giants and not affected by dust extinction , detected the predicted overabundance in the Scutum – Centaurus arm but not in the Carina – Sagittarius arm : the Scutum @-@ Centaurus Arm contains approximately 30 % more red giants than would be expected in the absence of a spiral arm . In 2008 , Robert Benjamin of the University of Wisconsin – Whitewater used this observation to suggest that the Milky Way possesses only two major stellar arms : the Perseus arm and the Scutum – Centaurus arm . The rest of the arms contain excess gas but not excess old stars . In December 2013 , astronomers found that the distribution of young stars and star @-@ forming regions matches the four @-@ arm spiral description of the Milky Way . Thus , the Milky Way appears to have two spiral arms as traced by old stars and four spiral arms as traced by gas and young stars . The explanation for this apparent discrepancy is unclear . 
 The Near 3 kpc Arm ( also called Expanding 3 kpc Arm or simply 3 kpc Arm ) was discovered in the 1950s by astronomer van Woerden and collaborators through 21 @-@ centimeter radio measurements of HI ( atomic hydrogen ) . It was found to be expanding away from the central bulge at more than 50 km / s . It is located in the fourth galactic quadrant at a distance of about 5 @.@ 2 kpc from the Sun and 3 @.@ 3 kpc from the Galactic Center . The Far 3 kpc Arm was discovered in 2008 by astronomer Tom Dame ( Harvard @-@ Smithsonian CfA ) . It is located in the first galactic quadrant at a distance of 3 kpc ( about 10 @,@ 000 ly ) from the Galactic Center . 
 A simulation published in 2011 suggested that the Milky Way may have obtained its spiral arm structure as a result of repeated collisions with the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy . 
 It has been suggested that the Milky Way contains two different spiral patterns : an inner one , formed by the Sagittarius arm , that rotates fast and an outer one , formed by the Carina and Perseus arms , whose rotation velocity is slower and whose arms are tightly wound . In this scenario , suggested by numerical simulations of the dynamics of the different spiral arms , the outer pattern would form an outer <unk> and the two patterns would be connected by the Cygnus arm . 
 Outside of the major spiral arms is the Monoceros Ring ( or Outer Ring ) , a ring of gas and stars torn from other galaxies billions of years ago . However , several members of the scientific community recently restated their position affirming the Monoceros structure is nothing more than an over @-@ density produced by the flared and warped thick disk of the Milky Way . 
 = = = Halo = = = 
 The Galactic disk is surrounded by a spheroidal halo of old stars and globular clusters , of which 90 % lie within 100 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 30 kpc ) of the Galactic Center . However , a few globular clusters have been found farther , such as PAL 4 and <unk> at more than 200 @,@ 000 light @-@ years from the Galactic Center . About 40 % of the Milky Way 's clusters are on retrograde orbits , which means they move in the opposite direction from the Milky Way rotation . The globular clusters can follow rosette orbits about the Milky Way , in contrast to the elliptical orbit of a planet around a star . 
 Although the disk contains dust that obscures the view in some wavelengths , the halo component does not . Active star formation takes place in the disk ( especially in the spiral arms , which represent areas of high density ) , but does not take place in the halo , as there is little gas cool enough to collapse into stars . Open clusters are also located primarily in the disk . 
 Discoveries in the early 21st century have added dimension to the knowledge of the Milky Way 's structure . With the discovery that the disk of the Andromeda Galaxy ( M31 ) extends much further than previously thought , the possibility of the disk of the Milky Way extending further is apparent , and this is supported by evidence from the discovery of the Outer Arm extension of the Cygnus Arm and of a similar extension of the Scutum @-@ Centaurus Arm . With the discovery of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy came the discovery of a ribbon of galactic debris as the polar orbit of the dwarf and its interaction with the Milky Way tears it apart . Similarly , with the discovery of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy , it was found that a ring of galactic debris from its interaction with the Milky Way encircles the Galactic disk . 
 On January 9 , 2006 , Mario <unk> and others of Princeton University announced that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of the northern sky found a huge and diffuse structure ( spread out across an area around 5 @,@ 000 times the size of a full moon ) within the Milky Way that does not seem to fit within current models . The collection of stars rises close to perpendicular to the plane of the spiral arms of the Milky Way . The proposed likely interpretation is that a dwarf galaxy is merging with the Milky Way . This galaxy is tentatively named the Virgo Stellar Stream and is found in the direction of Virgo about 30 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 9 kpc ) away . 
 = = = = Gaseous halo = = = = 
 In addition to the stellar halo , the Chandra X @-@ ray Observatory , XMM @-@ Newton , and Suzaku have provided evidence that there is a gaseous halo with a large amount of hot gas . The halo extends for hundreds of thousand of light years , much further than the stellar halo and close to the distance of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds . The mass of this hot halo is nearly equivalent to the mass of the Milky Way itself . The temperature of this halo gas is between 1 million and 2 @.@ 5 million kelvin . 
 Observations of distant galaxies indicate that the Universe had about one @-@ sixth as much baryonic ( ordinary ) matter as dark matter when it was just a few billion years old . However , only about half of those baryons are accounted for in the modern Universe based on observations of nearby galaxies like the Milky Way . If the finding that the mass of the halo is comparable to the mass of the Milky Way is confirmed , it could be the identity of the missing baryons around the Milky Way . 
 = = = Sun ’ s location and neighborhood = = = 
 The Sun is near the inner rim of the Orion Arm , within the Local Fluff of the Local Bubble , and in the Gould Belt , at a distance of 8 @.@ 33 ± 0 @.@ 35 kiloparsecs ( 27 @,@ 200 ± 1 @,@ 100 ly ) from the Galactic Center . The Sun is currently 5 – 30 parsecs ( 16 – 98 ly ) from the central plane of the Galactic disk . The distance between the local arm and the next arm out , the Perseus Arm , is about 2 @,@ 000 parsecs ( 6 @,@ 500 ly ) . The Sun , and thus the Solar System , is located in the Milky Way 's galactic habitable zone . 
 There are about 208 stars brighter than absolute magnitude 8 @.@ 5 within a sphere with a radius of 15 parsecs ( 49 ly ) from the Sun , giving a density of one star per 69 cubic parsec , or one star per 2 @,@ 360 cubic light @-@ year ( from List of nearest bright stars ) . On the other hand , there are 64 known stars ( of any magnitude , not counting 4 brown dwarfs ) within 5 parsecs ( 16 ly ) of the Sun , giving a density of about one star per 8 @.@ 2 cubic parsec , or one per 284 cubic light @-@ year ( from List of nearest stars ) . This illustrates the fact that there are far more faint stars than bright stars : in the entire sky , there are about 500 stars brighter than apparent magnitude 4 but 15 @.@ 5 million stars brighter than apparent magnitude 14 . 
 The apex of the Sun 's way , or the solar apex , is the direction that the Sun travels through space in the Milky Way . The general direction of the Sun 's Galactic motion is towards the star Vega near the constellation of Hercules , at an angle of roughly 60 sky degrees to the direction of the Galactic Center . The Sun 's orbit about the Milky Way is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the Galactic spiral arms and non @-@ uniform mass distributions . In addition , the Sun oscillates up and down relative to the Galactic plane approximately 2 @.@ 7 times per orbit . This is very similar to how a simple harmonic oscillator works with no drag force ( damping ) term . These oscillations were until recently thought to coincide with mass lifeform extinction periods on Earth . However , a reanalysis of the effects of the Sun 's transit through the spiral structure based on CO data has failed to find a correlation . 
 It takes the Solar System about 240 million years to complete one orbit of the Milky Way ( a galactic year ) , so the Sun is thought to have completed 18 – 20 orbits during its lifetime and 1 / 1250 of a revolution since the origin of humans . The orbital speed of the Solar System about the center of the Milky Way is approximately 220 km / s or 0 @.@ 073 % of the speed of light . The Sun moves through the heliosphere at 84 @,@ 000 km / h ( 52 @,@ 000 mph ) . At this speed , it takes around 1 @,@ 400 years for the Solar System to travel a distance of 1 light @-@ year , or 8 days to travel 1 AU ( astronomical unit ) . The Solar System is headed in the direction of the zodiacal constellation Scorpius , which follows the ecliptic . 
 = = = Galactic rotation = = = 
 The stars and gas in the Milky Way rotate about its center differentially , meaning that the rotation period varies with location . As is typical for spiral galaxies , the orbital speed of most stars in the Milky Way does not depend strongly on their distance from the center . Away from the central bulge or outer rim , the typical stellar orbital speed is between 210 and 240 km / s . Hence the orbital period of the typical star is directly proportional only to the length of the path traveled . This is unlike the situation within the Solar System , where two @-@ body gravitational dynamics dominate and different orbits have significantly different velocities associated with them . The rotation curve ( shown in the figure ) describes this rotation . Toward the center of the Milky Way the orbit speeds are too low , whereas beyond 7 <unk> the speeds are too high to match what would be expected from the universal law of gravitation . 
 If the Milky Way contained only the mass observed in stars , gas , and other baryonic ( ordinary ) matter , the rotation speed would decrease with distance from the center . However , the observed curve is relatively flat , indicating that there is additional mass that cannot be detected directly with electromagnetic radiation . This inconsistency is attributed to dark matter . The rotation curve of the Milky Way agrees with the universal rotation curve of spiral galaxies , the best evidence for the existence of dark matter in galaxies . Alternatively , a minority of astronomers propose that a modification of the law of gravity may explain the observed rotation curve . 
 = = Formation = = 
 The Milky Way began as one or several small <unk> in the mass distribution in the Universe shortly after the Big Bang . Some of these <unk> were the seeds of globular clusters in which the oldest remaining stars in what is now the Milky Way formed . These stars and clusters now comprise the stellar halo of the Milky Way . Within a few billion years of the birth of the first stars , the mass of the Milky Way was large enough so that it was spinning relatively quickly . Due to conservation of angular momentum , this led the gaseous interstellar medium to collapse from a roughly spheroidal shape to a disk . Therefore , later generations of stars formed in this spiral disk . Most younger stars , including the Sun , are observed to be in the disk . 
 Since the first stars began to form , the Milky Way has grown through both galaxy mergers ( particularly early in the Milky Way 's growth ) and accretion of gas directly from the Galactic halo . The Milky Way is currently accreting material from two of its nearest satellite galaxies , the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds , through the Magellanic Stream . Direct accretion of gas is observed in high @-@ velocity clouds like the Smith Cloud . However , properties of the Milky Way such as stellar mass , angular momentum , and metallicity in its outermost regions suggest it has undergone no mergers with large galaxies in the last 10 billion years . This lack of recent major mergers is unusual among similar spiral galaxies ; its neighbour the Andromeda Galaxy appears to have a more typical history shaped by more recent mergers with relatively large galaxies . 
 According to recent studies , the Milky Way as well as Andromeda lie in what in the galaxy color – magnitude diagram is known as the green valley , a region populated by galaxies in transition from the blue cloud ( galaxies actively forming new stars ) to the red sequence ( galaxies that lack star formation ) . Star @-@ formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star @-@ forming gas in the interstellar medium . In simulated galaxies with similar properties , star formation will typically have been extinguished within about five billion years from now , even accounting for the expected , short @-@ term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between both the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy . In fact , measurements of other galaxies similar to the Milky Way suggest it is among the reddest and brightest spiral galaxies that are still forming new stars and it is just slightly bluer than the <unk> red sequence galaxies . 
 = = = Age and cosmological history = = = 
 Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the Milky Way , which thus set a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way . The ages of individual stars in the Milky Way can be estimated by measuring the abundance of long @-@ lived radioactive elements such as thorium @-@ 232 and uranium @-@ 238 , then comparing the results to estimates of their original abundance , a technique called nucleocosmochronology . These yield values of about 12 @.@ 5 ± 3 billion years for CS <unk> @-@ 001 and 13 @.@ 8 ± 4 billion years for BD + 17 ° <unk> . Once a white dwarf is formed , it begins to undergo radiative cooling and the surface temperature steadily drops . By measuring the temperatures of the coolest of these white dwarfs and comparing them to their expected initial temperature , an age estimate can be made . With this technique , the age of the globular cluster M4 was estimated as 12 @.@ 7 ± 0 @.@ 7 billion years . Age estimates of the oldest of these clusters gives a best fit estimate of 12 @.@ 6 billion years , and a 95 % confidence upper limit of 16 billion years . 
 Several individual stars have been found in the Milky Way 's halo with measured ages very close to the 13 @.@ 80 @-@ billion @-@ year age of the Universe . In 2007 , a star in the galactic halo , HE 1523 @-@ <unk> , was estimated to be about 13 @.@ 2 billion years old . As the oldest known object in the Milky Way at that time , this measurement placed a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way . This estimate was made using the UV @-@ Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the Very Large Telescope to measure the relative strengths of spectral lines caused by the presence of thorium and other elements created by the R @-@ process . The line strengths yield abundances of different elemental isotopes , from which an estimate of the age of the star can be derived using nucleocosmochronology . Another star , HD <unk> , is 14 @.@ 5 ± 0 @.@ 7 billion years old and thus formed at least 13 @.@ 8 billion years ago . 
 The age of stars in the galactic thin disk has also been estimated using nucleocosmochronology . Measurements of thin disk stars yield an estimate that the thin disk formed 8 @.@ 8 ± 1 @.@ 7 billion years ago . These measurements suggest there was a hiatus of almost 5 billion years between the formation of the galactic halo and the thin disk . Recently Misha Hayward and his team at the Paris Observatory , through studying the chemical signatures of thousands of stars , have suggested that stellar formation may have dropped by an order of magnitude between 10 and 8 billion years ago . They suggest that this seems to have occurred at the time of disk formation , suggesting that the disc and barred structure by stirring up the gas made it too hot to form new stars at the same rate as before . 
 Donald Lynden @-@ Bell at Cambridge University in 1976 showed that the satellite galaxies surrounding the Milky way are not randomly distributed , but seemed to be the result of a break @-@ up of some larger system producing a ring structure 500 @,@ 000 light years in diameter and 50 @,@ 000 light years wide . Close encounters between galaxies , like that expected in 4 billion years with Andromeda rips off huge tails of gas , which , over time can coalesce to form dwarf galaxies in a ring at right angles to the main disc . Pavel Kroupa , and his doctoral student <unk> at the University of Bonn , studying the alignment of globular clusters and the whispy tails of the breakup of dwarf galaxies found they too formed part of such rings of matter . In 2013 Rodrigo Ibata of the University of Strasbourg in France , has shown a similar ring structure exists around Andromeda Galaxy , as a part of a coherent rotating structure , suggesting the Milky Way and Andromeda had interacted in the past . But this is impossible even if we take account of the hidden dark matter haloes . A subtle change such as that suggested by the MOND model allows for an interaction between the two galaxies 7 – 11 billion years ago . Justin <unk> of the University of Pennsylvania has suggested that if Dark Matter can involve a superfluid Bose @-@ Einstein condensate it mimics the MOND model at certain states . 
 = = Environment = = 
 The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are a binary system of giant spiral galaxies belonging to a group of 50 closely bound galaxies known as the Local Group , itself being part of the Virgo Supercluster . The Virgo Supercluster forms part of a greater structure , called Laniakea . 
 Two smaller galaxies and a number of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group orbit the Milky Way . The largest of these is the Large Magellanic Cloud with a diameter of 14 @,@ 000 light @-@ years . It has a close companion , the Small Magellanic Cloud . The Magellanic Stream is a stream of neutral hydrogen gas extending from these two small galaxies across 100 ° of the sky . The stream is thought to have been dragged from the Magellanic Clouds in tidal interactions with the Milky Way . Some of the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way are Canis Major Dwarf ( the closest ) , Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy , Ursa Minor Dwarf , Sculptor Dwarf , Sextans Dwarf , Fornax Dwarf , and Leo I Dwarf . The smallest dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way are only 500 light @-@ years in diameter . These include Carina Dwarf , Draco Dwarf , and Leo II Dwarf . There may still be undetected dwarf galaxies that are dynamically bound to the Milky Way , which is supported by the detection of nine new satellites of the Milky Way in a relatively small patch of the night sky in 2015 . There are also some dwarf galaxies that have already been absorbed by the Milky Way , such as Omega Centauri . 
 In 2014 researchers reported that most satellite galaxies of the Milky Way actually lie in a huge disk , with almost all satellite galaxies moving in the same direction within this disk . This came as a surprise : according to standard cosmology , the galaxies should form in halos of dark matter , be widely distributed and should move in random directions . This discrepancy is still not fully explained . 
 In January 2006 , researchers reported that the heretofore unexplained warp in the disk of the Milky Way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple or vibration set up by the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as they orbit the Milky Way , causing vibrations when they pass through its edges . Previously , these two galaxies , at around 2 % of the mass of the Milky Way , were considered too small to influence the Milky Way . However , in a computer model , the movement of these two galaxies creates a dark matter wake that amplifies their influence on the larger Milky Way . 
 Current measurements suggest the Andromeda Galaxy is approaching us at 100 to 140 kilometers per second . In 3 to 4 billion years , there may be an Andromeda – Milky Way collision , depending on the importance of unknown lateral components to the galaxies ' relative motion . If they collide , the chance of individual stars colliding with each other is extremely low , but instead the two galaxies will merge to form a single elliptical galaxy or perhaps a large disk galaxy over the course of about a billion years . 
 = = Velocity = = 
 Although special relativity states that there is no " preferred " inertial frame of reference in space with which to compare the Milky Way , the Milky Way does have a velocity with respect to cosmological frames of reference . 
 One such frame of reference is the Hubble flow , the apparent motions of galaxy clusters due to the expansion of space . Individual galaxies , including the Milky Way , have peculiar velocities relative to the average flow . Thus , to compare the Milky Way to the Hubble flow , one must consider a volume large enough so that the expansion of the Universe dominates over local , random motions . A large enough volume means that the mean motion of galaxies within this volume is equal to the Hubble flow . Astronomers believe the Milky Way is moving at approximately 630 km per second with respect to this local co @-@ moving frame of reference . The Milky Way is moving in the general direction of the Great <unk> and other galaxy clusters , including the Shapley supercluster , behind it . The Local Group ( a cluster of gravitationally bound galaxies containing , among others , the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy ) is part of a supercluster called the Local Supercluster , centered near the Virgo Cluster : although they are moving away from each other at 967 km / s as part of the Hubble flow , this velocity is less than would be expected given the 16 @.@ 8 million pc distance due to the gravitational attraction between the Local Group and the Virgo Cluster . 
 Another reference frame is provided by the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) . The Milky Way is moving at 552 ± 6 km / s with respect to the photons of the CMB , toward 10 @.@ 5 right ascension , − 24 ° declination ( <unk> epoch , near the center of Hydra ) . This motion is observed by satellites such as the Cosmic Background Explorer ( COBE ) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) as a dipole contribution to the CMB , as photons in equilibrium in the CMB frame get blue @-@ shifted in the direction of the motion and red @-@ shifted in the opposite direction . 
 = = Etymology and mythology = = 
 In Babylonia , the Milky Way was said to be the tail of Tiamat , set in the sky by Marduk after he had slain the salt water goddess . It is believed this account , from the Enuma Elish had Marduk replace an earlier Sumerian story when Enlil of Nippur had slain the goddess . 
 In western culture the name " Milky Way " is derived from its appearance as a dim un @-@ resolved " milky " glowing band arching across the night sky . The term is a translation of the Classical Latin via lactea , in turn derived from the Hellenistic Greek γαλαξίας , short for γαλαξίας κύκλος ( <unk> <unk> , " milky circle " ) . The Ancient Greek γαλαξίας ( galaxias ) – from root <unk> , <unk> ( " milk " ) + <unk> ( forming adjectives ) – is also the root of " galaxy " , the name for our , and later all such , collections of stars . In Greek mythology it was supposedly made from the forceful suckling of Heracles , when Hera acted as a <unk> for the hero . 
 The Milky Way , or " milk circle " , was just one of 11 " circles " the Greeks identified in the sky , others being the zodiac , the meridian , the horizon , the equator , the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn , Arctic and Antarctic circles , and two <unk> circles passing through both poles . 
 = = Astronomical history = = 
 In Meteorologica ( DK 59 A80 ) , Aristotle ( 384 – 322 BC ) wrote that the Greek philosophers Anaxagoras ( c . 500 – 428 BC ) and Democritus ( 460 – 370 BC ) proposed that the Milky Way might consist of distant stars . However , Aristotle himself believed the Milky Way to be caused by " the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars which were large , numerous and close together " and that the " ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere , in the region of the world which is continuous with the heavenly motions . " The Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger ( c . 495 – 570 A.D. ) criticized this view , arguing that if the Milky Way were sublunary , it should appear different at different times and places on Earth , and that it should have parallax , which it does not . In his view , the Milky Way is celestial . This idea would be influential later in the Islamic world . 
 The Persian astronomer Abū Rayhān al @-@ Bīrūnī ( 973 – 1048 ) proposed that the Milky Way is " a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars " . The Andalusian astronomer <unk> ( d 1138 ) proposed the Milky Way to be made up of many stars but appears to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction in Earth 's atmosphere , citing his observation of a conjunction of Jupiter and Mars in 1106 or 1107 as evidence . Ibn <unk> Al @-@ <unk> ( 1292 – 1350 ) proposed that the Milky Way is " a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars " and that these stars are larger than planets . 
 According to Jamil <unk> , the Persian astronomer <unk> al @-@ Dīn al @-@ <unk> ( 1201 – 1274 ) in his <unk> writes : " The Milky Way , i.e. the Galaxy , is made up of a very large number of small , tightly clustered stars , which , on account of their concentration and smallness , seem to be cloudy patches . Because of this , it was likened to milk in color . " 
 Actual proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars . In a treatise in 1755 , Immanuel Kant , drawing on earlier work by Thomas Wright , speculated ( correctly ) that the Milky Way might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars , held together by gravitational forces akin to the Solar System but on much larger scales . The resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk . Kant also conjectured that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate " galaxies " themselves , similar to our own . Kant referred to both the Milky Way and the " extragalactic nebulae " as " island universes " , a term still current up to the 1930s . 
 The first attempt to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the Sun within it was carried out by William Herschel in 1785 by carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the visible sky . He produced a diagram of the shape of the Milky Way with the Solar System close to the center . 
 In 1845 , Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral @-@ shaped nebulae . He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae , lending credence to Kant 's earlier conjecture . 
 In 1917 , Heber Curtis had observed the nova S Andromedae within the Great Andromeda Nebula ( Messier object 31 ) . Searching the photographic record , he found 11 more novae . Curtis noticed that these novae were , on average , 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within the Milky Way . As a result , he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150 @,@ 000 parsecs . He became a proponent of the " island universes " hypothesis , which held that the spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies . In 1920 the Great Debate took place between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis , concerning the nature of the Milky Way , spiral nebulae , and the dimensions of the Universe . To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy , Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way , as well as the significant Doppler shift . 
 The controversy was conclusively settled by Edwin Hubble in the early 1920s using the Mount Wilson observatory 2 @.@ 5 m Hooker telescope . With the light @-@ gathering power of this new telescope he was able to produce astronomical photographs that resolved the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars . He was also able to identify some Cepheid variables that he could use as a benchmark to estimate the distance to the nebulae . He found that the Andromeda Nebula is 275 @,@ 000 parsecs from the Sun , far too distant to be part of the Milky Way . 
 = Grey 's Anatomy ( season 3 ) = 
 The third season of the American television medical drama Grey 's Anatomy , commenced airing on the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) on September 21 , 2006 , and concluded on May 17 , 2007 . The season was produced by Touchstone Television , in association with Shondaland Production Company and The Mark Gordon Company , the showrunner being Shonda Rhimes . Actors Ellen Pompeo , Sandra Oh , Katherine Heigl , Justin Chambers , and T.R. Knight reprised their roles as surgical interns Meredith Grey , Cristina Yang , Izzie Stevens , Alex Karev , and George O 'Malley , respectively , continuing their expansive storylines as focal points throughout the season . Previous main cast members Chandra Wilson , James Pickens , Jr . , Kate Walsh , Isaiah Washington , and Patrick Dempsey also returned , while previous guest stars Sara Ramirez and Eric Dane were promoted to series regulars , following the extension of their contracts . 
 The season followed the continuation of the surgical residency of five young interns , as they experience the demands of the competitive field of medicine , which becomes defining in their personal evolution . Although set in fictional Seattle Grace Hospital , located in Seattle , Washington , filming primarily occurred in Los Angeles , California . Whereas the first season mainly focused on the impact the surgical field has on the main characters , and the second one provided a detailed perspective on the physicians ' private lives , the third season deals with the tough challenges brought by the last phase of the surgeons ' internship , combining the professional motif emphasized in the first season , with the complex personal background used in the second . Through the season , several new storylines are introduced , including the arrival of Dane 's character , Dr. Mark Sloan , conceived and introduced as an antagonizing presence . 
 In a departure from the previous season , the third season aired in a new competitive time slot of 9 : 00 pm on Thursdays , competing against the heavily promoted and highly rated dramatic television series CSI : Crime Scene Investigation , which simultaneously aired on the CBS Network . Season three of Grey 's Anatomy contained 25 episodes , in addition to two clip shows that were produced to recap the previous events of the show , before the introduction of major new arcs . " Complications of the Heart " aired on the same night as the season premiere , recapping the last episodes of the second season with insights into future episodes in the third , while " Every Moment Counts " aired before the twentieth episode . The season also aired a two @-@ part episode arc , which primarily served as a backdoor pilot for a proposed spin @-@ off , Private Practice , focusing on the departure of Walsh 's character , Dr. Addison Montgomery . 
 The series ended its third season with an average of 19 @.@ 22 million viewers per episode and a 6 @.@ 8 / 35 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic , ranking eighth in the television season , outperformed by CSI . Television critics expressed a mainly negative outlook on the development of the series throughout the season , with the reviews ranging from mixed to unfavorable , as exaggeration and lack of realism have been highlighted as the main issues in the declining quality of the storylines . Despite the negative critical response , the performance of the cast members and the production technique of the crew received outstanding recognition through numerous awards and nominations . Earning major category nominations at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards and the 65th Golden Globe Awards , the season achieved the series ' highest number of recipients , with Heigl being the most awarded cast member . The series was ranked sixth in USA Today 's " best of television " list , following the conclusion of the season .

 This season is the last to be produced by ABC Studios under title of Touchstone Television , as the company 's decision to change its name occurred after the conclusion of the season . Shonda Rhimes returned as the series ' showrunner and executive producer . She also continued her position from the first two seasons as one of the most prominent members of the writing staff . Betsy Beers , Mark Gordon and Rob Corn also returned as executive producers , along with Mark Wilding , Peter Horton and Krista Vernoff , who have been in this position since the inception of the series . Allan Heinberg , however , joins the production team at the beginning of the third season as a co @-@ executive producer , before his promotion to an executive . Kent Hodder , Nancy Bordson and Steve Mulholland served as executive producers for four episodes during the season . Horton left the series at the conclusion of the season , whereas James D. Parriott , who previously served a writer and executive producer for the first two seasons , did not continue his work on the show during this season . Joan Rater and Tony Phelan continued to serve as co @-@ executive producers , with Rater being a supervising producer as well . Stacy McKee , who previously served as a producer and writer for the series , was promoted to co @-@ executive producer . 
 After having written three episodes for the first season and five for the second , Rhimes returned as a writer for six episodes , out of which one was written along with Marti Noxon . Krista Vernoff , Tony Phelan , Stacy McKee and Mark Wilding returned to the series as members of the writing staff , with Vernoff and Phelan writing three episodes and McKee and Wilding producing the script of two episodes . Gabrielle Stanton and Harry Werksman , Jr. worked together for the writing of one episode , after three episodes they have written for the series in the past . The season includes the first episode to be written by Debora Cahn , who would become one of the series ' main writers , as well as a consulting and supervisor producer . Other writers include Kip Koenig , Carolina <unk> , Eric Buchman , Joan Rater and Chris Van Dusen . Rob Corn returned to the series to direct three episodes for the season , after writing two episodes in the second season . Greg Yaitanes is credited for directing two episodes during the season , the only ones to have been directed by him in the series . Other prominent directors were Jeff Melman , Michael Grossman , Julie Anne Robinson and Adam Arkin , each directing two or more episodes during the season . Danny Lux continued his position as the main music composer for the series , while Herbert Davis and Walt Fraser served as the season 's cinematography directors . Susan Vaill and Edward Ornelas resumed their positions as editors , seeing David Greenspan , Matthew Ramsey and Avi Fisher being added to the team . Fisher , however , left the series at the conclusion of the season .

 The season was primarily filmed in Los Angeles , California . Fisher Plaza , which is the headquarters building for the media company Fisher Communications and Fisher 's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle , is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital , such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter 's helipad . This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle , which is directly across the street from Fisher Plaza , the Seattle Monorail , and other local landmarks . However , the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle , are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills , California . Most scenes are primarily taped in Los Feliz , Los Angeles , at the Prospect Studios , and the set occupies two stages , including the hospital pieces , but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle . Several props used are genuine medical supplies , including the MRI machine . Before the production of the season officially began , producer Shonda Rhimes stated that she was planning a major development in Ellen Pompeo 's character , Meredith Grey . 
 " There 's a spirit there that 's just very interesting to me . She was charming and there was something about her so intriguing to watch " , stated Rhimes in response to <unk> 's portrayal of her character . Executive producer Betsy Beers stated that the writing staff was going to focus on the balance between her vulnerability and her courage , also dealing with changes in the relationship with her friends . Pompeo noted that the uncertainty of her character 's fate is what helped her evolve into a more adaptable actor . Rhimes also disclosed that an episode with Ellis Grey 's unexpected lucidity and eventual death was in plans since the beginning of the series . Rhimes described how Pompeo got through the challenge of sending Meredith in the afterlife : " It was an exciting place to take her . Exciting to watch her find her way back . " In response to Izzie 's arc , Shonda Rhimes discussed the impact Denny Duquette 's death will have on her , noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism , which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine . In the aftermath of Denny 's death , Katherine Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor . Executive producer Betsy Beers explained , however , that Denny 's death served to make Izzie more mature , and Heigl affirmed that " At the beginning of the third season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was . She lost her optimism . She realizes now that life is difficult , but she still tries very hard to see the best in people . " 
 Creator Shonda Rhimes compared what she deemed the two " most iconic moments of the season " , describing how the season begins with Izzie lying in the prom dress on the bathroom , and ends with Cristina standing motionless in her wedding dress . Cast member Eric Dane described the impact his first scene in the season had on him , stating that it was a spectacular entrance : " It was a brand new towel , which had a hard time staying together . So every time I put it together and let my hands go , it was almost like throwing caution to the wind . " Cast member Sara Ramirez noted that one of the most significant scene in the season was when Izzie and George " have this beautiful moment when neither of them speaks , but they say so much and it was just so rich " , describing how their interaction during the scene determined everything that would be developed for their arc later . Betsy Beers , however , noted that the most " powerful " scene in the season saw Cristina Yang and Preston Burke in the on @-@ call room , talking about the future of their relationship : " It 's fascinating to see how their entire relationship changes and almost disintegrates in this one exchange " . Beers and Rhimes expressed their desire to introduce Patrick Dempsey 's passion of car racing in the series , although this ultimately did not occur during the season . " Patrick loved it . He 's always driving something new , always trying something out " , stated the series creator , regarding Dempsey 's response to the storyline . 
 Rhimes also described the difficulty she faced in finding an appropriate love interest for the character of Alex Karev : " We kept meeting with people and it wasn 't until we met Elizabeth Reaser and sat down with her , and in two seconds in realized that she was absolutely the one we 'd been looking for . " Reaser explained that when she was cast , there were no definite plans for the development of her character , and that only the intrigue of the ferry accident had been explained to her . She also deemed her character " frustrated and scared " . As for the make up process , Reaser stated : " The prosthetic changes your outlook on yourself . It can be very disorienting . It 's intense . " Beers , however , noted that the focus on Ava was mainly due to her inability to express her feelings through facial expressions , only communicating with her eyes and voice . Executive producer Rob Corn stated that his plan for the original arc was about Jane Doe 's inner life , struggling to get out of the situation she is trapped in . He stated that the main characteristics they had been looking for in the actress for the part were strength and vulnerability . He also called Reaser 's performance " heart @-@ wrenching and wonderful " . Betsy Beers , the show 's supervising executive producer , found Izzie to have been marked for life by Denny 's death , which matured her " in a very sobering way " , but played a major role in making her feel more confident . She also noted the undeniable connection between Izzie and Alex Karev , whose desire to do honorable things has been compared with his " cutting and sarcastic " personality . After Izzie 's continuous efforts to change Alex during their relationship in the previous season , Beers announced the possibility of a relationship between the two of them . She also contrasted the female leads on the show with women in film , explaining how the characters on television are shaped in unique ways .

 On February 21 , 2007 , The Wall Street Journal reported that ABC was pursuing a spin @-@ off medical drama television series for the series featuring Kate Walsh 's character , Addison Montgomery . Subsequent reports confirmed the decision , stating that an expanded two @-@ hour broadcast of Grey 's Anatomy would serve as a backdoor pilot for the proposed spin @-@ off . The cast was reportedly unhappy about the decision , as all hoped the spin @-@ off would have been given to them . Pompeo commented that she felt , as the star , she should have been consulted , and Heigl , disclosed that she had hoped for a spin @-@ off for Izzie . The backdoor pilot that aired on May 3 , 2007 , sees Addison take " a leave of absence " from Seattle Grace Hospital , to visit her best friend from Los Angeles , Naomi Bennett , a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist , in order to get pregnant . While in Los Angeles , she meets Bennett 's colleagues at the Oceanside Wellness Center and even becomes the clinic 's obstetrician @-@ gynecologist for the day . The two @-@ hour broadcast served as the twenty @-@ second and the twenty @-@ third episodes of the third season , and was directed by Michael Grossman , according to Variety . The cast included Amy Brenneman , Paul Adelstein , Tim Daly , Taye Diggs , Chris Lowell and Merrin Dungey . ABC officially picked up Private Practice for its 2007 lineup on May 11 , 2007 .

 The season received mixed to negative reviews , after two seasons that resulted in heavy critical acclaim . Following a positive outlook on the second season , Christopher Monfette of IGN Entertainment expressed disappointment during the third one , mainly due to the declining quality and lack of realism of the storylines . He noted a growing number of similarities between the season 's arcs and the ones that are developed in soap operas , by stating that " the line which separates primetime television from soap opera is oftentimes razor thin " and admitting that , despite his considering the series " the best drama " , he freely admits that it requires some inherent suspension of disbelief , after it " found itself mired in the annoying and absurd " . Whereas Monfette acknowledged that the fans would consider the problem to have been a simple case of lazy writing , he noted that over @-@ writing played a main role in the series becoming unexpectedly unrealistic . He also noted the senseless intrigues in the Derek / Meredith relationship , by stating that the season would not have achieved high ratings if a functional relationship had been introduced : " The season generally opts to stall out for its vast majority , providing Meredith with some bizarrely under @-@ developed sub @-@ plot about depression and giving Derek a season 's worth of reconsidering to do " . 
 Monfette criticized the romantic development of the characters throughout the season , by describing Cristina and Burke 's relationship as an excuse for the possibility of a wedding for Meredith , whereas Burke 's unfair behavior towards Cristina is thought to be manipulative , exposing her to his overly romantic notion of an ideal ceremony . The way the doubts regarding the success of their relationship were resolved in the season finale was described as " most obvious and least compelling . " IGN Entertainment was also critical of Alex Karev 's storyline , who is seen falling for a pregnant and badly injured Jane Doe , despite having always been " self @-@ obsessed " . Monfette once again noted the lack of realism in the improvement of Jane Doe 's condition , as she gives birth to her baby and undergoes reconstructive surgery in a short amount of time . However , her incapability and continuous struggle to remember who she is was considered to be " the most affecting and honest plotline of the season " , noting the nuanced and emotionally resonant scenes , which gave the show a " charmingly positive , feel @-@ good foundation " . Monfette considered Izzie 's affair with George as the season 's worst but most significant storyline , criticizing its being " force @-@ red , emotionally incorrect , a mismatch from the beginning and a narrative long @-@ shot " , which does not express love , but lust . He agreed that the essential problem of the season was its reluctance to move , leading to frustration after seeing " the entertaining familiar characters so weighed down by their most annoying of traits " . 
 In response to the season premiere , Oscar Dahl of <unk> noted the predictability of the series , but expressed hope in its further development , by stating that it has become " a medical chick flick , but a damn good one " with a big and attractive cast . He also praised the interaction between the characters , noting the " smart " dialogue that helps each character evolve . However , Dahl expressed disappointment in the over emotional scenes , describing them as " off @-@ putting " and " not believable " , while comparing them to real life interactions between people who emote in a more subtle manner than displayed on television . " Emotions ran high in the premiere and there was much crying " , stated Dahl , but noted that the dialogue , who he had previously been worried would be " too cutesy " , was not bothering , and rather realistic , noting how the show is " smartly written " . He also described the acting of Ellen Pompeo and Katherine Heigl as " worthy of attention " . 
 New York Post 's Robert Rorke reviewed the numerous characters with heavy romantic development , noting perpetual " merry @-@ go @-@ round of hookups , breakups and makeup sex " , while describing the lack of sentimental involvement of Katherine Heigl 's character in the first half of the season . However , he deemed Izzie Stevens " the hear and soul " of the " sex @-@ filled series " , due to the season mostly focusing on the events that come to define her as a person . Rorke named her the show 's heroine , and wrote that " Izzie is a welcome , calming presence , despite the devastation she experienced when she failed to save her patient and fiancé Denny Duquette " , considering her to have been more prominent than the title character , Meredith Grey , whose storyline received negative critiques : " She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas . But lately , she 's been a little dopey , with that endless McDreamy soliloquies . " He also noted Meredith 's decreasing importance in the ongoing arc , describing how Sandra Oh 's character development was vital to the success of the season , as he compared her " cutthroat exterior " with the emotional side of her personality that evolves throughout the season . New York Post compared Izzie , who is described as having achieved a depth , to Miranda Bailey , noting the maturity they have , which is uncharacteristic to the fellow interns . Robert Rorke positively reviewed Chandra Wilson 's performance by stating that she was " formidable " . 
 Prior to the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards , Stuart Levine of Variety reviewed the performances of the three cast members nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actress category . " The ladies of Grey 's Anatomy dominate the category , and it 'd be far from a stretch to say at least two of those women rose to high dramatics last season " , commented Levine , while praising Sandra Oh for her portrayal of Cristina Yang who endured a tumultuous seasoning relationship , seeing her trepidation at spending a life together with the man she loved . He regarded the appearances of Chandra Wilson as more subdued , though " by no means less well @-@ executed " . He deemed Miranda Bailey a rock , being the most level @-@ headed character on the show with a right thing to say in any situation . He expressed admiration towards Chandra Wilson , by describing her as being " flashy and over the top " , which he considers better than being consistently good . Considering Heigl 's chances of winning the Emmy , Levine assessed of her performance , by remarking the slight difficulty she has in reaching each emotional state Izzie Stevens has to go through : " Showrunner Shonda Rhimes puts a lot of pressure on Heigl to carry many intense storylines , and she 's up to the challenge . " However , he also noted that Izzie 's irrational actions during crisis situations may be bothering .
