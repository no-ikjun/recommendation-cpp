 Due to production of the fourth season being put on hold due to the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , the show runners wanted to hold the eight episodes that had been completed until they were able to make more of the season . ABC decided against this and announced that " The Beginning of the End " would be aired at the end of January 2008 , regardless of when the strike was to end . This was the first Lost episode to be aired on Thursday at 9 : 00 pm ET , a competitive and prestigious timeslot normally occupied by Grey 's Anatomy ; previous episodes had been aired on Wednesdays . Like the previous Lost season premieres , " The Beginning of the End " was scheduled for an outdoor premiere at Sunset on the Beach in Waikiki , Honolulu , where movies are regularly shown on a 30 @-@ foot ( 9 m ) screen free to the public , but it was cancelled due to the writers ' strike . The original television broadcast of the episode was immediately preceded by a clip @-@ show titled " Lost : Past , Present & Future " .

 Don Williams of BuddyTV dubbed " The Beginning of the End " " the most anticipated season premiere of the year " . It was watched by approximately 16 @.@ 137 million American viewers live or within six hours with a 6 @.@ 7 / 17 in the key adults 18 – 49 demographic , bringing in the best Nielsen ratings for Lost in seventeen episodes and ranking Lost eighth in the weekly charts . The episode was watched by a total of 17 @.@ 766 million viewers live or recorded and watched within seven days of broadcast and this number went toward the year @-@ end average . In Canada , " The Beginning of the End " was seen by 1 @.@ 855 million viewers , making Lost the sixth most watched program of the week . It brought in an audience almost double the size of that of the previous episode and greater than any third season episode , with the exception of the season premiere . The fourth season premiere was successful in the United Kingdom with 1 @.@ 1 million viewers . In Australia , Lost was the fifteenth most watched show of the night with 912 000 viewers , which was deemed disappointing by David Dale of The Sun @-@ Herald . 
 American critics were sent screener DVDs of " The Beginning of the End " and " Confirmed Dead " on January 28 , 2008 . Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore — a weighted average based on the impressions of a select twelve critical reviews — of 87 . Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that " returning with a heart @-@ stopping , perfectly pitched episode ... Lost is an oasis in a strike @-@ parched TV desert . " Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times described " The Beginning of the End " as an " emotion @-@ churning chemical dump right in the old brain stem — horror , hysteria , regret , adrenaline and what ... will happen next ? " Adam Buckman of the New York Post gave the episode four out of four stars . Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune " blissfully enjoyed every minute " and noted that " there aren 't any faults " . Diane Werts of Newsday raved the episode as " superb " and " insanely entertain [ ing ] " and concluded her review with " Lost seems to have found itself " . Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle declared that it and " Confirmed Dead " " are roller coasters of fast action and revelation [ that are ] good to see " . Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe pointed out that " Lost can still make the pulse race and the brain tingle ... [ and ] remains TV 's most gripping serial " . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger was unsure " if Lost is ever going to give satisfying answers to its many , many remaining mysteries ... but when it 's as scary and hilarious and moving and exciting as these two episodes , I 'm okay with that . " In less positive reviews , Rodney Ho of The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution called it " a satisfactory return episode with a fair share of drama and pathos ... [ that ] provides just enough revelations to keep fans hungry for more " and David Hinckley of the Daily News rated the episode with three stars out of a possible five . 
 Brian Lowry of Variety said that " Lost 's return goes down like a welcome tonic as scripted TV fades to black ... providing an unusually generous array of juicy moments for the large ( and , at times , neglected ) cast . " Mark Medley of the National Post called it " a brilliant season premiere " with multiple " jaw @-@ dropping moments " . Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly felt that the premiere was mind @-@ blowing and featured good acting by Garcia . Frazier Moore of the Associated Press wrote that " Lost is further upping the ante , and heightening the pressure on us as the show 's vast mythology continues to metastasize . " Kristin Dos Santos of E ! called it " so well written , produced , acted and directed it felt like a movie " . Michael Ausiello of TV Guide described it as " easily one of the best hours of TV so far this season . " Bruce Fretts of TV Guide responded well to Reddick 's performance . Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode 9 @.@ 1 / 10 , stating that it was " a great start to what promises to be an exciting ... season 4 . The momentum and pacing is on par with last season 's finale " . LTG of Television Without Pity graded it as an " A – " . Jon Lachonis of UGO gave the episode an " A + " , calling it " a crushingly emotional , action packed introduction ... [ which proves ] that ... Lost 's groundbreaking protean form still has plenty of blinding ways to dazzle and entertain in a way that is nonetheless unique unto itself . " Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV wrote that " the episode was pretty much a masterpiece " . Daniel of TMZ graded it as an " A " , saying that it was perfect and set up the rest of the season well . 
 = HMS Indefatigable ( R10 ) = 
 HMS Indefatigable was an Implacable @-@ class aircraft carrier built for the Royal Navy ( RN ) during World War II . She was completed in 1944 , and her aircraft made several attacks that year against the German battleship Tirpitz , inflicting only light damage ; they also raided targets in Norway . The ship was transferred to the British Pacific Fleet ( BPF ) at the end of the year and attacked Japanese @-@ controlled oil refineries in Sumatra in January 1945 before joining the American forces in March as they prepared to invade the island of Okinawa in Operation Iceberg . Indefatigable and the BPF joined the Americans in attacking the Japanese Home Islands in July and August . Following the end of hostilities she visited ports in Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . 
 After returning to the UK in early 1946 , Indefatigable was modified for transport duties , and ferried troops and civilians for the rest of the year before she was reduced to reserve . She was recommissioned in 1950 as a training ship for service with the Home Fleet Training Squadron , participating in exercises and making several port visits overseas . The Board of Admiralty decided that she was redundant in early 1954 and decommissioned her later that year . Indefatigable was sold for scrap the following year . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Implacable class were ordered under the 1938 Naval Programme by the Chamberlain government as part of the general rearmament begun in response to the rise of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy . The design originated as an improved version of the Illustrious @-@ class aircraft carriers and was intended to be 2 knots ( 3 @.@ 7 km / h ; 2 @.@ 3 mph ) faster and carry an additional dozen aircraft over the 30 @-@ knot ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) speed and 36 aircraft of the earlier ships . To remain within the 23 @,@ 000 long tons ( 23 @,@ 000 t ) limit allowed by the Second London Naval Treaty , these improvements could only be made by reducing armour protection . Indefatigable was 766 feet 6 inches ( 233 @.@ 6 m ) long overall and 730 feet ( 222 @.@ 5 m ) at the waterline . Her beam was 95 feet 9 inches ( 29 @.@ 2 m ) at the waterline , and she had a draught of 29 feet 4 inches ( 8 @.@ 9 m ) at deep load . The Implacable @-@ class ships were significantly overweight and displaced 32 @,@ 110 long tons ( 32 @,@ 630 t ) at deep load . The ships had metacentric heights of 4 @.@ 06 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) at light load and 6 @.@ 91 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) at deep load as completed . Indefatigable 's complement was approximately 2 @,@ 300 officers and enlisted men in 1945 . 
 The ships had four Parsons geared steam turbines , each driving one shaft , using steam supplied by eight Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 148 @,@ 000 shp ( 110 @,@ 000 kW ) , enough to give the Indefatigable @-@ class ships a maximum speed of 32 @.@ 5 knots ( 60 @.@ 2 km / h ; 37 @.@ 4 mph ) . On sea trials , Indefatigable reached speeds of 32 @.@ 06 knots ( 59 @.@ 38 km / h ; 36 @.@ 89 mph ) with 150 @,@ 935 shp ( 112 @,@ 552 kW ) . She carried a maximum of 4 @,@ 810 long tons ( 4 @,@ 890 t ) of fuel oil which gave her a range of 6 @,@ 900 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 800 km ; 7 @,@ 900 mi ) at 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . 
 The 760 @-@ foot ( 231 @.@ 6 m ) armoured flight deck had a maximum width of 102 feet ( 31 @.@ 1 m ) . A single hydraulic aircraft catapult was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck . The Implacable @-@ class carriers were equipped with two lifts on the centreline , the forward of which measured 45 by 33 feet ( 13 @.@ 7 by 10 @.@ 1 m ) and served only the upper hangar , and the aft lift ( 45 by 22 feet ( 13 @.@ 7 by 6 @.@ 7 m ) ) , which served both hangars . The upper hangar was 458 feet ( 139 @.@ 6 m ) long and the lower hangar was 208 feet ( 63 @.@ 4 m ) long ; both had a maximum width of 62 feet ( 18 @.@ 9 m ) . Each hangar had a height of only 14 feet which precluded storage of Lend @-@ Lease Vought F4U Corsair fighters as well as many post @-@ war aircraft and helicopters . Designed to stow 48 aircraft in their hangars , the use of a permanent deck park allowed the Implacable class to accommodate up to 81 aircraft . The additional crewmen , maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support these aircraft were housed in the lower hangar . The ships were provided with 94 @,@ 650 imperial gallons ( 430 @,@ 300 l ; 113 @,@ 670 US gal ) of aviation gasoline . 
 = = = Armament , electronics and protection = = = 
 The ship 's main armament consisted of sixteen quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 114 mm ) dual @-@ purpose guns in eight twin @-@ gun turrets , four in sponsons on each side of the hull . Unlike the Illustrious @-@ class ships , the roofs of the gun turrets were flat and flush with the flight deck . The gun had a maximum range of 20 @,@ 760 yards ( 18 @,@ 980 m ) . Indefatigable 's light anti @-@ aircraft defences included five octuple mounts for QF 2 @-@ pounder ( " pom @-@ pom " ) anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns , two on the flight deck forward of the island , one on the aft part of the island , and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull . A single quadruple 2 @-@ pounder mount was also fitted on the port side of the hull . The 2 @-@ pounder gun had a maximum range of 6 @,@ 800 yards ( 6 @,@ 200 m ) . The ship was also fitted with 55 Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon in 17 single and 19 twin @-@ gun mounts . These guns had a maximum range of 4 @,@ 800 yards ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) , but some were replaced by 40 mm Bofors AA guns when the ships were transferred to the Pacific Theatre as the 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) shell was unlikely to destroy a kamikaze before it hit the ship . The Bofors gun had a maximum range of 10 @,@ 750 yards ( 9 @,@ 830 m ) . By August 1945 , Indefatigable had 10 single Bofors guns , plus 14 twin and 12 single Oerlikon mounts . By April 1946 these had been reduced to 11 Bofors guns , 6 twin and 7 single Oerlikon guns . 
 The specifics of the Implacable @-@ class ships ' radar suite are not readily available . They were fitted with the Type 277 surface @-@ search / height @-@ finding radar on top of the bridge and a Type 293 target indicator radar on the foremast . Victorious , one of the Illustrious @-@ class ships upon which Indefatigable 's design was based , also carried Type 279 and Type 281B early @-@ warning radars . Type 282 and Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on the fire @-@ control directors . 
 The Implacable @-@ class ships had a flight deck protected by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of armour . The sides of the hangars were either 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) or 2 inches ( 51 mm ) . The ends of the hangars were protected by 2 @-@ inch bulkheads and the armour of the hangar deck ranged from 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 to 64 mm ) in thickness . The waterline armour belt was 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick , but only covered the central portion of the ship . The belt was closed by 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft . The underwater defence system was a layered system of liquid- and air @-@ filled compartments as used in the Illustrious class . The magazines for the 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns lay outside the armoured citadel and were protected by 2 to 3 @-@ inch roofs , 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch sides and 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @-@ inch ends .

 Indefatigable was laid down by John Brown & Co. at their shipyard in Clydebank on 3 November 1939 as Yard Number 565 . She was launched on 8 December 1942 by Victoria of Hesse , Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven . Captain Quentin Graham was appointed to command the ship in August 1943 . While fitting out , in order to confound the enemy , a ruse known as Operation Bijou , initiated by London Controlling Section , was launched whereby it was made known that Indefatigable had already entered service . Ultra decrypts revealed that the Japanese believed the deception , with operatives including Malcolm Muggeridge and Peter Fleming supplying disinformation for more than a year , sufficient to make the enemy believe the vessel had gone to the Far East and returned to the Clyde for a refit , by which time she was actually finished . 
 The ship was commissioned on 8 December 1943 and began sea trials , which revealed many problems that required rectification and delayed her formal completion until 3 May 1944 . While Indefatigable was still conducting builder 's trials , a de Havilland Mosquito landed aboard on 25 March , piloted by Lieutenant Eric Brown . This was the first landing by a twin @-@ engined aeroplane on a carrier . The ship was assigned to the Home Fleet and was working up over the next several months while the Fairey Fireflies of 1770 Squadron flew aboard on 18 May . The squadron was followed by the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 826 Squadron in June . 
 = = = Norwegian operations = = = 
 Indefatigable 's first mission was a brief sortie on 1 July 1944 to provide air cover for the ocean liner RMS Queen Elizabeth that was ferrying American troops to Britain . Upon her return , Indefatigable embarked the Supermarine Seafire fighters of 887 Squadron and the Barracudas of 820 Squadron , completing No. 9 Naval Torpedo @-@ Bomber Reconnaissance Wing , over the next week . Her first combat mission was an attack on the battleship Tirpitz in Kaafjord on 17 July with two other Home Fleet carriers ( Operation Mascot ) . She contributed 23 Barracudas and 12 Fireflies to the mission ; the former attacked the battleship while the Fireflies strafed the flak positions defending her . A smoke screen prevented most of the Barracudas from seeing their target and they failed to hit Tirpitz . One Barracuda was forced to ditch near the carrier and its crew was rescued by the destroyer Verulam . 
 894 Squadron , equipped with Seafires , landed aboard after the attack on 24 July to complete No. 24 Naval Fighter Wing . Indefatigable and several escort carriers attacked targets in Norway on 10 August , destroying 6 Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters and sinking a minesweeper . For Operation Goodwood , a series of attacks on Tirpitz , the Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters of 1840 Squadron replaced the Barracudas of 826 Squadron . The first mission took place on the morning of 22 August when Indefatigable launched 12 Barracudas , 11 Fireflies , 8 Hellcats , and 8 Seafires against the German battleship and nearby targets . A smoke screen again protected Tirpitz and no damage was inflicted ; two Seafires failed to return . Another attack was made later in the day without effect . A further attack could not be mounted until 24 August because of bad weather ; for this mission the carrier contributed 12 Barracudas , 11 Fireflies and 4 Seafires , all of which returned . Tirpitz was lightly damaged by two hits during this attack , one a 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bomb and the other a 1 @,@ 600 @-@ pound ( 730 kg ) armour @-@ piercing bomb . The latter penetrated the armoured deck but failed to explode and would probably have inflicted serious damage , possibly even sinking the ship , had it done so . A final attack was made five days later , again without effect . 887 Squadron sank seven seaplanes at their moorings at Banak during the operation .

 On 19 September 1944 , Indefatigable sortied from Scapa Flow to attack targets near Tromsø , but the operation was cancelled because of bad weather . The ship underwent a brief refit at her builder 's yard between 28 September and 8 November . She became the flagship of the 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron ( 1st ACS ) when Rear Admiral Sir Philip Vian hoisted his flag on 15 November . The following day , King George VI inspected the ship ; the ground crews later embarked for 820 , 887 , 894 and 1770 Squadrons . Their aircraft , 40 Seafires , 12 Fireflies , and 21 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers , followed on 19 November , and she sailed for the Far East to join the British Pacific Fleet . Indefatigable arrived at Colombo , Ceylon , on 10 December and Vian transferred his flag to Indomitable . 
 Together with Victorious and Indomitable , Indefatigable attacked an oil refinery at <unk> Brandan , Sumatra on 4 January 1945 ( Operation Lentil ) . She embarked six photoreconnaissance Hellcats of 888 Squadron for the attack ; her only contribution to the attack itself was the Fireflies of 1770 Squadron , which used RP @-@ 3 rocket projectiles on their targets . The squadron claimed to have shot down a Nakajima Ki @-@ 43 " Oscar " , for the loss of a Firefly that ran out of fuel and had to ditch next to the ship . After Indefatigable 's return , Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten , Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Command , addressed the crew on 11 January . En route to Sydney to prepare for operations in the Pacific , the BPF 's carriers attacked oil refineries near Palembang , Sumatra , on 24 and 29 January ( Operation Meridian ) . The ship 's Seafires lacked the range to reach the targets so they were retained on combat air patrols ( CAP ) over the fleet for both attacks . She contributed 10 of her Avengers and all of her Fireflies to the first attack , which destroyed most of the oil storage tanks and cut the refinery 's output by half for three months . Five days later , the BPF attacked a different refinery and 820 Squadron again contributed 10 Avengers to the attack while 1770 Squadron added 9 Fireflies . The latter squadron also flew 2 Fireflies on an armed reconnaissance mission over an airfield that lay between the carriers and their target . The attack was very successful at heavy cost , but the losses of Indefatigable 's squadrons are not available . Her Seafires shot down a Mitsubishi Ki @-@ 46 " Dinah " reconnaissance aircraft searching for the fleet and 5 Kawasaki Ki @-@ 48 " Lily " bombers that attacked at low level . 
 The BPF arrived in Sydney on 10 February ; the crews received leave and the ships got some maintenance before they sailed for the BPF 's advance base at Manus Island , in the Admiralty Islands , on 27 February . They arrived on 7 March and exercised together before sailing for Ulithi on 18 March . The BPF joined the American Fifth Fleet there two days later to participate in the preliminary operations for the invasion of Okinawa . The British role during the operation was to neutralise airfields on the Sakishima Islands , between Okinawa and Formosa , beginning on 26 March . Her Seafires were again retained to defend the fleet and only her Avengers and Fireflies attacked the airfields . Her Seafire squadrons lacked 13 of their authorised strength of 50 pilots and could not sustain the pace of the first day of operations , when they flew 72 sorties . After a break at the end of the month to refuel , Indefatigable became the first British carrier to be hit by a kamikaze the day after flying operations resumed , when one of the Japanese planes evaded the CAP and struck the base of the carrier 's island on 1 April . The bomb it carried did not detonate and this limited casualties to 21 men killed and 27 wounded . Damage to the ship was minimal and the flight deck was back in operation thirty minutes later . On 12 and 13 April , the BPF switched targets to airfields in northern Formosa . On the first day , a pair of Fireflies encountered five Mitsubishi Ki @-@ 51 " Sonia " dive bombers and shot down four of them . A flight of four Seafires on CAP spotted four Japanese fighters , three Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes and a Kawasaki Ki @-@ 61 " Tony " later that morning , and shot down one Zero . The BPF returned to the Sakishima Islands on 17 April before retiring to Leyte Gulf to rest and resupply . <unk> of Seafires to all causes was very heavy during the operation with 25 out of 40 lost or damaged beyond repair and only 5 replacements received . Their short range and lack of endurance was considered by Vian to be a severe handicap for the BPF , which returned to action on 4 May and again attacked targets in the Sakishima Islands . Its aircraft continued to do so until they flew their last missions of Operation Iceberg on 25 May . Statistics complied by the BPF staff showed that 61 Seafires were lost or damaged beyond repair during both phases of the operation due to deck @-@ landing accidents . 
 The BPF arrived back at Sydney on 5 June and sailed for Manus three weeks later . Indefatigable was forced to remain behind as she required repairs to her machinery . Her air group flew aboard on 7 July ( 1772 Squadron and its Fireflies replacing 1770 Squadron ) when she sailed for Manus . She reached the coast of Japan on 20 July and her aircraft began attacking targets near Osaka and in the Inland Sea four days later . Her Seafire squadrons had adapted larger external fuel tanks for their aircraft and they were no longer limited to CAP duty . The BPF 's aircraft crippled the escort carrier Kaiyo and sank numerous smaller ships on 24 July . After replenishing , airstrikes resumed on 28 and 30 July , the British sinking the escort Okinawa near Maizuru . A combination of bad weather , refuelling requirements and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima delayed the resumption of air operations until 9 August . During the day , Indefatigable 's aircraft attacked targets in northern Honshu and southern Hokkaido . The attacks were repeated the next day , sinking two warships and numerous small merchantmen and destroying numerous railroad locomotives and parked aircraft . 
 The BPF had been scheduled to withdraw after 10 August to prepare for Operation Olympic , the invasion of Kyushu scheduled for November , and the bulk of the force departed for Manus on 12 August . Indefatigable , however , had been chosen to remain as part of the Allied occupation force . The next day her aircraft attacked targets in the vicinity of Tokyo . Flight operations resumed on the morning of the 15th after an operational pause to refuel . The first airstrike was tasked to attack <unk> Air Field with four Fireflies and six Avengers , escorted by eight Seafires , but was forced to divert to its secondary target because of bad weather . En route they were attacked by a dozen Zeros in the last British air combat of the war . The Japanese fighters shot down one Seafire on their first pass and crippled an Avenger . The Seafires claimed four Zeros shot down , four others probably shot down , and another four damaged . An Avenger also claimed one Zero as damaged . A Yokosuka D4Y " Judy " dive bomber attacked the carrier after the ceasefire went into effect , but its two bombs missed . After the ceasefire , Indefatigable 's aircraft continued to fly CAP and flew reconnaissance missions looking for Allied prisoners of war , dropping supplies to them as they were located .

 On 17 August 1945 , Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser , commander of the BPF , came aboard and addressed the crew . Indefatigable continued flying operations until she entered Sagami Bay on 5 September . She departed three days later for Manus en route to Sydney . The ship arrived at Sydney on 18 September and began a leisurely refit that lasted until 15 November . On 1 November , Captain Ian MacIntyre relieved Graham as captain of the ship . She became Vian 's flagship on 22 November and sailed to New Zealand to show the flag . She arrived in Wellington on 27 November and was opened for public tours , during which time the Prime Minister , Peter Fraser , also visited . Indefatigable then sailed to Auckland , arriving on 12 December , and was again opened for tours . She returned to Sydney for the holidays and visited Melbourne on 22 January 1946 before departing for home nine days later . Vian transferred his flag to her sister ship Implacable that day and the ship stopped off at Fremantle and Cape Town en route . While Indefatigable was visiting the latter city , she was opened to the public , and the Governor @-@ General of South Africa toured the ship . 
 The carrier arrived at Portsmouth Dockyard on 16 March 1946 . Her hangars were modified to accommodate over 1 @,@ 900 passengers , including women , and she departed for Australia on 25 April carrying 782 RN personnel and 130 Australian war brides . Most of the RN personnel disembarked at Colombo and most of the war brides did the same at Fremantle . Indefatigable continued on to Sydney , where she embarked a complete naval hospital , with patients , and over 1 @,@ 000 RN officers and ratings . She departed on 9 June and arrived at Plymouth on 7 July . Her next voyage involved transporting a much smaller number of men to Malta and Colombo ; only 47 officers and 67 ratings , most of whom left the ship at Malta . When she arrived at Colombo on 15 August , she loaded a full complement of passengers from all three services to return to the UK . The ship arrived at Portsmouth on 9 September and her next voyage involved over 1 @,@ 200 RN personnel and civilians ferried to Malta , Colombo , and Singapore where almost 1 @,@ 300 personnel embarked . She returned to Portsmouth on 29 November and began a brief refit in preparation for her final trooping voyage . Indefatigable sailed empty for Norfolk , Virginia , where she loaded RN personnel before returning to Portsmouth on 21 November . The next month , she was placed in reserve and Captain MacIntyre retired on 7 January 1947 . 
 The Admiralty decided to recommission Indefatigable for use as a training ship in mid @-@ 1949 . Captain Henry Fancourt assumed command on 22 August to prepare for sea . The ship arrived at Devonport to begin the necessary modifications on 30 August and the following day Fancourt turned over command to the dockyard . Captain John Grindle was appointed to command on 24 March 1950 and the ship was recommissioned on 28 May . Two days later Captain Robert Sherbrooke , VC , relieved Grindle and Indefatigable began her sea trials on 28 June . She was inspected by Rear Admiral St John <unk> , Flag Officer Training Squadron , on 3 July and received her first trainees shortly afterwards . She participated in exercises with the Home Fleet and joined it in Gibraltar in September and October . On 12 March 1951 she sortied from Portland , flying <unk> 's flag , to exercise with the Home Fleet before beginning a brief refit at Devonport in May . Captain John Grant relieved Sherbrooke on 6 June and the ship was opened to visitors as part of the Festival of Britain on 17 July . Five days later the visitors were stranded aboard ship overnight when a storm came up and forced Indefatigable to put to sea . The seas moderated the next day and the visitors departed in safety . Rear Admiral Royer Dick hoisted his flag aboard the carrier in September until she began a short refit at Devonport in January 1952 . 
 Indefatigable joined Implacable for her annual winter visit to Gibraltar after completing her refit in February 1952 . Over the summer she exercised with the Home Fleet and visited the Danish port of Aarhus , where she was visited by Queen Alexandrine of Denmark in July . Captain Ralph Fisher assumed command on 30 January 1953 and took her to sea three weeks later for exercises with the Home Fleet and her annual visit to Gibraltar . She returned to Portland in late March and visited Bournemouth at the end of May . She joined her sister and several other carriers on 9 June to sail for Spithead for the Coronation Fleet Review of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June as one of a fleet of nine carriers . Indefatigable joined her sister for fleet exercises off the Scilly Isles and in the Bristol Channel in September and October before beginning her annual refit on 6 October . The Admiralty announced on 26 January 1954 that both ships would be replaced as training ships and reduced to reserve . This had no short @-@ term impact on their activities as they sailed for the Western Mediterranean on their annual winter cruise . The ship exercised with the Home Fleet and made a port visit to Casablanca , Morocco , before visiting Gibraltar . Captain Hugh Browne assumed command on 10 May after Fisher had been promoted . The ship welcomed home Queen Elizabeth II and her husband four days later as they returned from their tour of the Commonwealth . The following month , Indefatigable exercised with the Home Fleet in Scottish waters and visited Aarhus again . In August she began transferring her training duties to the carrier Ocean and arrived at Rosyth on 2 September to be paid off , a process that took until the following month to complete . She was towed to Gareloch in June 1955 where she was listed for disposal . Indefatigable was sold for scrap in September 1956 and subsequently broken up at Faslane .

 = Jesper Blomqvist = 
 Lars Jesper Blomqvist ( born 5 February 1974 ) is a Swedish former footballer who played as a left winger . 
 Most recently he was the playing assistant manager of Superettan side Hammarby from December 2009 to November 2010 . He played at IFK Göteborg , where he won four straight Allsvenskan league titles between 1993 and 1996 , and Manchester United , where he was part of the team that won the treble in 1999 , consisting of the Premier League , FA Cup and UEFA Champions League . He returned to Swedish football in 2003 with Djurgården , where he won his final Allsvenskan title , before initially retiring in 2005 . An injury crisis prompted a playing return for Enköping in 2008 . Blomqvist has made 30 international appearances for Sweden and helped them to third place at the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States .

 After an early spell at <unk> IK , Blomqvist signed for then recently formed Umeå FC in 1992 . In the spring portion of his first season for the club , he helped them to the Division 2 Norra Norrland title , promoting the club to Division 1 Norra for the autumn . At the time this was the second tier of Swedish football . Subsequently , he signed for IFK Göteborg on 11 September 1993 . Blomqvist played a part in the club 's Allsvenskan win that year . He scored eight goals in 24 league appearances en route to the league title in 1994 . Furthermore , he played a part in Sweden 's advance to the semi finals of the World Cup and scored in the club 's 3 – 1 win over Manchester United in the Champions League , knocking them out of the competition . This performance caught the eye of United manager Alex Ferguson and helped the team qualify for the quarter @-@ finals of the tournament . Another title followed in 1995 , with Blomqvist 's goal against Helsingborgs IF , when he performed a variant of the Pelé runaround move , voted goal of the season . In his last season for Göteborg , he played against former club Umeå , who had reached the Allsvenskan for the first time in their history . In 1996 , Blomqvist was voted Fan 's Player of the Year and Midfielder of the Year . At the end of the 1996 season , he signed for newly crowned Serie A champions Milan . 
 = = = Serie A = = = 
 In his first season of Italian football , Milan failed to win a trophy , and Blomqvist often sat on the bench . He nearly decided against going to Old Trafford because he did not want a repeat of this season . The defending champions had an equally disappointing season , finishing 11th in Serie A and failing to qualify for European football . Blomqvist was subsequently sold to Serie A runners up Parma in the summer of 1997 . Blomqvist enjoyed more regular football , although the club finished 6th in the league and missed out on the knockout stages of the Champions League . The Swede 's sole league goal for the club was scored in a 4 – 0 win over Napoli at Stadio San Paolo . 
 = = = Premier League = = = 
 Manchester United purchased Blomqvist as a backup to Ryan Giggs in 1998 , for a fee of £ 4 @.@ 4 million . He featured in enough games to win a Premier League winner 's medal in the 1999 season , scoring his only goal for the club in a 4 – 1 away win against Everton . He received an FA Cup winners medal despite being an unused substitute in the final . He did , however , start against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final . He came close to scoring before eventually being replaced by Teddy Sheringham , who later scored , equalising the match after Bayern 's early goal . United went on to win the match 2 – 1 . He lost his Champions League medal in the celebrations but found it again before leaving Barcelona . 
 Due to a serious knee injury , Blomqvist did not play football in the next two seasons , which resulted in Manchester United deciding not to renew his contract ( During his time out , due to this injury , he did media work for MUTV , United 's in @-@ house television channel , and presented his own cookery show called " Cooking With Jesper " ) . Nonetheless , Ferguson persuaded Everton manager Walter Smith to offer the Swedish international a short term contract at Goodison Park , from November 2001 until the end of the season . Blomqvist played on the wings alongside compatriot Niclas Alexandersson , and scored his first goal for Everton against Sunderland in January 2002 . Injury problems persisted , however , and new manager David Moyes allowed him to leave the club in June 2002 . He had a trial at Middlesbrough , but was unhappy with the club 's handling of the situation , labelling it " a bit unprofessional " . Instead he signed for Alan Curbishley 's Charlton Athletic on a free transfer , for whom he made three league appearances . 
 = = = Return to Sweden = = = 
 Again struggling with injury , Blomqvist returned to his native Sweden after only four games with Charlton . He signed on a short term deal with Djurgårdens IF . This proved unpopular among supporters of IFK Göteborg , who labelled him " Judas " . Göteborg fans considered the decision to join Djurgården instead of them a betrayal . Blomqvist played a part as the side became Swedish champions that year . Injury problems , however , restricted him to only nine league appearances . As during the stint with Manchester United , he remained at the club for another two seasons , before finally deciding to retire due to injury in 2005 . 
 Blomqvist joined <unk> SK as a coach in 2008 and went on to make a playing return in the Superettan , the second tier of Swedish football . Ironically , a shortage of players at the club due to injury forced Blomqvist 's playing return . The player shortage was highlighted when Blomqvist was sent off in his second game for the club . This resulted in a suspension for Blomqvist , and Enköping only having fifteen players available for the following match . On 15 September 2008 , he scored his first professional goal in five years in a 1 – 0 win against IK Sirius . In total , he made 10 Superettan appearances , but was unable to save Enköping from relegation to Division 1 for the 2009 season . He left Enköping after the season and later signed a contract with newly relegated Hammarby IF as assistant manager to Michael <unk> . 
 In 2010 Blomqvist played again , coming on as a substitute in the 85th minute for Hammarby against Trelleborg FF in the Swedish Cup , being one of very few coaches actually playing a game for their team . After a rough period at the club , he left Hammarby in a mutual consent in November 2010 . 
 In 2012 , Blomqvist effectively retired as a footballer by focusing on his civilian career . He did this by initiating studies in commerce . 
 = = International career = = 
 Blomqvist was part of the bronze medal @-@ winning Swedish national team at the 1994 FIFA World Cup . He gained his first international cap against Colombia in 1994 . His only World Cup match in the starting eleven came against Cameroon , although he also replaced Henrik Larsson in the second half of a draw against eventual champions Brazil . Each member of the squad was awarded a Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in recognition of their third place in the tournament . Blomqvist was also considered for the 2002 FIFA World Cup squad . In total , Blomqvist has made 30 appearances for his country , without scoring .

 Blomqvist was born and raised in <unk> , in the Umeå Municipality of Sweden . He currently resides in Sweden , although he has also purchased property in Croatia . After officially retiring in 2005 , he became a pundit ( football expert ) for Swedish television station TV4 . Blomqvist was the victim of an assault during a visit to his hometown Umeå in September 2006 , when he was struck twice across the face . His attacker was prosecuted for the incident .

 = Francium = 
 Francium is a chemical element with symbol Fr and atomic number 87 . It used to be known as eka @-@ caesium and actinium K. It is the second @-@ least electronegative element , behind only caesium . Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine , radium , and radon . As an alkali metal , it has one valence electron . 
 Bulk francium has never been viewed . Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column , it is assumed that francium would appear as a highly reflective metal , if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid . Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable , since the extreme heat of decay ( the half @-@ life of its longest @-@ lived isotope is only 22 minutes ) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element . 
 Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France ( from which the element takes its name ) in 1939 . It was the last element first discovered in nature , rather than by synthesis . Outside the laboratory , francium is extremely rare , with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores , where the isotope francium @-@ 223 continually forms and decays . As little as 20 – 30 g ( one ounce ) exists at any given time throughout the Earth 's crust ; the other isotopes ( except for francium @-@ 221 ) are entirely synthetic . The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300 @,@ 000 atoms . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Francium is the most unstable of the naturally occurring elements : its most stable isotope , francium @-@ 223 , has a half @-@ life of only 22 minutes . In contrast , astatine , the second @-@ least stable naturally occurring element , has a half @-@ life of 8 @.@ 5 hours . All isotopes of francium decay into astatine , radium , or radon . Francium is also less stable than all synthetic elements up to element 105 , dubnium . 
 Francium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties mostly resemble those of caesium . A heavy element with a single valence electron , it has the highest equivalent weight of any element . Liquid francium — if created — should have a surface tension of 0 @.@ <unk> N / m at its melting point . Francium 's melting point was calculated to be around 27 ° C ( 80 ° F , 300 K ) . The melting point is uncertain because of the element 's extreme rarity and radioactivity . Thus , the estimated boiling point value of 677 ° C ( 1250 ° F , 950 K ) is also uncertain . 
 Linus Pauling estimated the electronegativity of francium at 0 @.@ 7 on the Pauling scale , the same as caesium ; the value for caesium has since been refined to 0 @.@ 79 , but there are no experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium . Francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than caesium , 392 @.@ 811 ( 4 ) kJ / mol as opposed to 375 @.@ <unk> ( 2 ) kJ / mol for caesium , as would be expected from relativistic effects , and this would imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two . Francium should also have a higher electron affinity than caesium and the Fr − ion should be more polarizable than the Cs − ion . The <unk> molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole , unlike all known <unk> alkali metal molecules . Francium superoxide ( FrO2 ) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners ; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium – oxygen bonding . 
 Francium coprecipitates with several caesium salts , such as caesium perchlorate , which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate . This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium , by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of <unk> and Nelson . It will additionally <unk> with many other caesium salts , including the iodate , the <unk> , the tartrate ( also rubidium tartrate ) , the chloroplatinate , and the <unk> . It also coprecipitates with <unk> acid , and with perchloric acid , without another alkali metal as a carrier , which provides other methods of separation . Nearly all francium salts are water @-@ soluble . 
 = = Isotopes = = 
 There are 34 known isotopes of francium ranging in atomic mass from 199 to 232 . Francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers . Francium @-@ 223 and francium @-@ 221 are the only isotopes that occur in nature , though the former is far more common . 
 Francium @-@ 223 is the most stable isotope , with a half @-@ life of 21 @.@ 8 minutes , and it is highly unlikely that an isotope of francium with a longer half @-@ life will ever be discovered or synthesized . Francium @-@ 223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium @-@ 227 . Francium @-@ 223 then decays into radium @-@ 223 by beta decay ( 1149 keV decay energy ) , with a minor ( 0 @.@ 006 % ) alpha decay path to astatine @-@ 219 ( 5 @.@ 4 MeV decay energy ) . 
 Francium @-@ 221 has a half @-@ life of 4 @.@ 8 minutes . It is the ninth product of the neptunium decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium @-@ 225 . Francium @-@ 221 then decays into astatine @-@ 217 by alpha decay ( 6 @.@ 457 MeV decay energy ) . 
 The least stable ground state isotope is francium @-@ 215 , with a half @-@ life of 0 @.@ 12 <unk> . ( 9 @.@ 54 MeV alpha decay to astatine @-@ 211 ) : Its metastable isomer , francium @-@ <unk> , is less stable still , with a half @-@ life of only 3 @.@ 5 ns . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Due to its instability and rarity , there are no commercial applications for francium . It has been used for research purposes in the fields of chemistry and of atomic structure . Its use as a potential diagnostic aid for various cancers has also been explored , but this application has been deemed impractical . 
 Francium 's ability to be synthesized , trapped , and cooled , along with its relatively simple atomic structure have made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments . These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles . Studies on the light emitted by laser @-@ trapped francium @-@ 210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory . 
 = = History = = 
 As early as 1870 , chemists thought that there should be an alkali metal beyond caesium , with an atomic number of 87 . It was then referred to by the provisional name eka @-@ caesium . Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element , and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made . 
 = = = Erroneous and incomplete discoveries = = = 
 Soviet chemist D. K. <unk> was the first scientist to claim to have found eka @-@ caesium , or francium . In 1925 , he observed weak radioactivity in a sample of potassium , another alkali metal , and incorrectly concluded that eka @-@ caesium was contaminating the sample ( the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope , potassium @-@ 40 ) . He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka @-@ caesium , in which he named the element <unk> after his home country . Shortly thereafter , <unk> began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of Odessa , and he did not pursue the element further . 
 The following year , English chemists Gerald J. F. Druce and Frederick H. Loring analyzed X @-@ ray photographs of manganese ( II ) sulfate . They observed spectral lines which they presumed to be of eka @-@ caesium . They announced their discovery of element 87 and proposed the name <unk> , as it would be the heaviest alkali metal . 
 In 1930 , Fred Allison of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute claimed to have discovered element 87 when analyzing pollucite and lepidolite using his magneto @-@ optical machine . Allison requested that it be named <unk> after his home state of Virginia , along with the symbols Vi and Vm . In 1934 , H.G. MacPherson of UC Berkeley disproved the effectiveness of Allison 's device and the validity of this false discovery . 
 In 1936 , Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and his French colleague Yvette Cauchois also analyzed pollucite , this time using their high @-@ resolution X @-@ ray apparatus . They observed several weak emission lines , which they presumed to be those of element 87 . Hulubei and Cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name <unk> , along with the symbol Ml , after Moldavia , the Romanian province where Hulubei was born . In 1937 , Hulubei 's work was criticized by American physicist F. H. Hirsh Jr . , who rejected Hulubei 's research methods . Hirsh was certain that eka @-@ caesium would not be found in nature , and that Hulubei had instead observed mercury or bismuth X @-@ ray lines . Hulubei insisted that his X @-@ ray apparatus and methods were too accurate to make such a mistake . Because of this , Jean Baptiste Perrin , Nobel Prize winner and Hulubei 's mentor , endorsed <unk> as the true eka @-@ caesium over Marguerite Perey 's recently discovered francium . Perey took pains to be accurate and detailed in her criticism of Hulubei 's work , and finally she was credited as the sole discoverer of element 87 . All other previous purported discoveries of element 87 were ruled out due to francium 's very limited half @-@ life . 
 = = = Perey 's analysis = = = 
 Eka @-@ caesium was discovered in 1939 by Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris , when she purified a sample of actinium @-@ 227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 keV . Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 keV . Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product , one which was separated during purification , but emerged again out of the pure actinium @-@ 227 . Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium , radium , lead , bismuth , or thallium . The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal ( such as coprecipitating with caesium salts ) , which led Perey to believe that it was element 87 , caused by the alpha decay of actinium @-@ 227 . Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium @-@ 227 . Her first test put the alpha branching at 0 @.@ 6 % , a figure which she later revised to 1 % . 
 Perey named the new isotope actinium @-@ K ( it is now referred to as francium @-@ 223 ) and in 1946 , she proposed the name <unk> for her newly discovered element , as she believed it to be the most electropositive cation of the elements . Irène Joliot @-@ Curie , one of Perey 's supervisors , opposed the name due to its connotation of cat rather than cation . Perey then suggested francium , after France . This name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry in 1949 , becoming the second element after gallium to be named after France . It was assigned the symbol Fa , but this abbreviation was revised to the current Fr shortly thereafter . Francium was the last element discovered in nature , rather than synthesized , following rhenium in 1925 . Further research into francium 's structure was carried out by , among others , Sylvain Lieberman and his team at CERN in the 1970s and 1980s .

 <unk> is the result of the alpha decay of 227Ac and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals . In a given sample of uranium , there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1 × 1018 uranium atoms . It is also calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the Earth 's crust at any given time . 
 = = = Synthesis = = = 
 Francium can be synthesized in the nuclear reaction : 
 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5 n 
 This process , developed by Stony Brook Physics , yields francium isotopes with masses of 209 , 210 , and 211 , which are then isolated by the magneto @-@ optical trap ( MOT ) . The production rate of a particular isotope depends on the energy of the oxygen beam . An 18O beam from the Stony Brook <unk> creates 210Fr in the gold target with the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5n . The production required some time to develop and understand . It was critical to operate the gold target very close to its melting point and to make sure that its surface was very clean . The nuclear reaction embeds the francium atoms deep in the gold target , and they must be removed efficiently . The atoms quickly diffuse to the surface of the gold target and are released as ions , but this does not happen every time . The francium ions are guided by electrostatic lenses until they land in a surface of hot yttrium and become neutral again . The francium is then injected into a glass bulb . A magnetic field and laser beams cool and confine the atoms . Although the atoms remain in the trap for only about 20 seconds before escaping ( or decaying ) , a steady stream of fresh atoms replaces those lost , keeping the number of trapped atoms roughly constant for minutes or longer . Initially , about 1000 francium atoms were trapped in the experiment . This was gradually improved and the setup is capable of trapping over 300 @,@ 000 neutral atoms of francium a time . These are neutral metallic atoms in a gaseous unconsolidated state . Enough francium is trapped that a video camera can capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce . The atoms appear as a glowing sphere about 1 millimeter in diameter . This was the first time that anyone had ever seen francium . The researchers can now make extremely sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms , providing the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium . Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory . Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons , and bombarding thorium with protons , deuterons , or helium ions . Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh .

 James Dudley ( May 12 , 1910 – June 1 , 2004 ) was an American baseball player , professional wrestling manager , and professional wrestling executive . He played Negro league baseball for nine years but is best known for his time with the World Wide Wrestling Federation . Dudley was the first African @-@ American to run a major United States arena ( Turner 's Arena in Washington , D.C. ) . He worked with four generations of wrestling 's McMahon family and was particularly close with Vincent J. McMahon . At age 74 , he was put back on the company 's payroll to show appreciation for his work for the McMahons .

 Dudley was considered an " excellent athlete " and ran the 100 yard dash in under ten seconds on multiple occasions . Although he showed up for the trials for the 1924 United States Olympic team , he was not allowed to participate because African Americans were not permitted on the team . After playing semi @-@ professional baseball in Baltimore , Maryland , Dudley signed with the Baltimore Elite Giants at age 27 . Nicknamed " Big Train " , he played catcher but started out helping pitchers warm up in the bullpen . Playing alongside two other talented catchers , Roy Campanella and <unk> Clarke , Dudley 's playing time was limited . He remained with the Elite Giants until leaving professional baseball in 1945 . In total , he played about 60 games in the Negro leagues .

 James Dudley began working for Jess McMahon in the 1950s , when McMahon was a co @-@ owner of the Capitol Wrestling Corporation . When McMahon and his partners broke away from the National Wrestling Alliance to form the World Wide Wrestling Federation ( WWWF ) in 1963 , Dudley continued to work for McMahon . Dudley performed many different jobs , from carrying buckets of waters to counting ticket sales . Dudley was a close friend of Vincent J. McMahon and continued working for the family when the younger McMahon took over the business from his father ; in particular , he drove McMahon 's limousine and served as his bodyguard . He has said that he thought of McMahon as a father figure . McMahon later increased Dudley 's responsibilities with the company several times , and eventually assigned him to manage Turner 's Arena in Washington , D.C. , which made Dudley the first African @-@ American to hold such a position in the United States . His role required him to oversee several other events , including the Town and Country Jamboree television show . 
 Dudley also managed several wrestlers , including Bobo Brazil . Prior to Brazil 's matches , Dudley excited the crowds by waving a towel while running to the ring . Over time , Dudley 's role with the company diminished and he ceased working for them ; the company 's operations were moved to Connecticut , and Turner 's Arena was demolished . Shortly before McMahon 's death in 1984 , he told his son , Vincent K. McMahon , who had taken over control of the promotion ( then known as the WWF ) , " Whatever else you do , you take care of James Dudley . " After Vincent J. McMahon 's death , Dudley was put back on the company payroll at age 74 and subsequently received several gifts from Vincent K. McMahon to show appreciation for Dudley 's contributions to the company . Dudley has been described as an " important cog " in the company , and McMahon once stated that " had there been no James Dudley , the WWF possibly wouldn 't exist as it does today " . Dudley continued to feel a sense of loyalty to the McMahons and their promotion . Dudley was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1994 by Vincent K. McMahon . 
 Dudley 's final appearance with the company came during the January 4 , 2002 episode of SmackDown ! . According to the storyline , Stephanie McMahon was banned from the MCI Center . In an attempt to get past security , she pushed Dudley in a wheelchair but was still refused entrance . Following the scene , Dudley left the wheelchair , walked to his seat , and watched the show .

 = Mental status examination = 
 The mental status examination or mental state examination , abbreviated MSE , is an important part of the clinical assessment process in psychiatric practice . It is a structured way of observing and describing a patient 's current state of mind , under the domains of appearance , attitude , behavior , mood and affect , speech , thought process , thought content , perception , cognition , insight and judgment . There are some minor variations in the subdivision of the MSE and the sequence and names of MSE domains . 
 The purpose of the MSE is to obtain a comprehensive cross @-@ sectional description of the patient 's mental state , which , when combined with the biographical and historical information of the psychiatric history , allows the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis and formulation , which are required for coherent treatment planning . 
 The data are collected through a combination of direct and indirect means : unstructured observation while obtaining the biographical and social information , focused questions about current symptoms , and formalised psychological tests . 
 The MSE is not to be confused with the mini @-@ mental state examination ( MMSE ) , which is a brief neuro @-@ psychological screening test for dementia . 
 = = Theoretical foundations = = 
 The MSE derives from an approach to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive phenomenology which developed from the work of the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers . From Jaspers ' perspective it was assumed that the only way to comprehend a patient 's experience is through his or her own description ( through an approach of empathic and non @-@ theoretical enquiry ) , as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes the analyst might understand experiences or processes of which the patient is unaware , such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives . 
 In practice , the MSE is a blend of empathic descriptive phenomenology and empirical clinical observation . It has been argued that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry : current usage , as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient ( a synonym for signs and symptoms ) , is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient 's subjective experience . 
 = = Application = = 
 The mental status examination is a core skill of qualified ( mental ) health personnel . It is a key part of the initial psychiatric assessment in an out @-@ patient or psychiatric hospital setting . It is a systematic collection of data based on observation of the patient 's behavior while the patient is in the clinician 's view during the interview . The purpose is to obtain evidence of symptoms and signs of mental disorders , including danger to self and others , that are present at the time of the interview . Further , information on the patient 's insight , judgment , and capacity for abstract reasoning is used to inform decisions about treatment strategy and the choice of an appropriate treatment setting . It is carried out in the manner of an informal enquiry , using a combination of open and closed questions , supplemented by structured tests to assess cognition . The MSE can also be considered part of the comprehensive physical examination performed by physicians and nurses although it may be performed in a cursory and abbreviated way in non @-@ mental @-@ health settings . Information is usually recorded as free @-@ form text using the standard headings , but brief MSE checklists are available for use in emergency situations , for example by paramedics or emergency department staff . The information obtained in the MSE is used , together with the biographical and social information of the psychiatric history , to generate a diagnosis , a psychiatric formulation and a treatment plan . 
 = = Domains = = 
 = = = Appearance = = = 
 Clinicians assess the physical aspects such as the appearance of a patient , including apparent age , height , weight , and manner of dress and grooming . Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania , while unkempt , dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression . If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self @-@ care or ill @-@ health . Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture , body modifications , or clothing not typical of the patient 's gender , might give clues to personality . Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse , such as signs of malnutrition , nicotine stains , dental erosion , a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse , or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse . Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self @-@ neglect , or alcohol intoxication . Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder , physical illness , anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety . 
 = = = Attitude = = = 
 Attitude , also known as rapport , refers to the patient 's approach to the interview process and the quality of information obtained during the assessment . 
 = = = Behavior = = = 
 Abnormalities of behavior , also called abnormalities of activity , include observations of specific abnormal movements , as well as more general observations of the patient 's level of activity and arousal , and observations of the patient 's eye contact and gait . Abnormal movements , for example <unk> , athetoid or <unk> movements may indicate a neurological disorder . A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication . The patient may have tics ( involuntary but quasi @-@ purposeful movements or vocalizations ) which may be a symptom of Tourette 's syndrome . There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia , such as <unk> , catalepsy , waxy flexibility and <unk> ( or <unk> ) . <unk> ( repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging ) or mannerisms ( repetitive quasi @-@ purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait ) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism . More global behavioural abnormalities may be noted , such as an increase in arousal and movement ( described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity ) which might reflect mania or delirium . An inability to sit still might represent akathisia , a side effect of antipsychotic medication . Similarly a global decrease in arousal and movement ( described as psychomotor retardation , <unk> or stupor ) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson 's disease , dementia or delirium . The examiner would also comment on eye movements ( repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations ) , and the quality of eye contact ( which can provide clues to the patient 's emotional state ) . Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism . 
 = = = Mood and affect = = = 
 The distinction between mood and affect in the MSE is subject to some disagreement . For example , <unk> and Baker ( 1993 ) describe affect as " the external and dynamic manifestations of a person 's internal emotional state " and mood as " a person 's predominant internal state at any one time " , whereas Sims ( 1995 ) refers to affect as " differentiated specific feelings " and mood as " a more prolonged state or disposition " . This article will use the <unk> and Baker ( 1993 ) definitions , with mood regarded as a current subjective state as described by the patient , and affect as the examiner 's inferences of the quality of the patient 's emotional state based on objective observation . 
 Mood is described using the patient 's own words , and can also be described in summary terms such as neutral , <unk> , dysphoric , euphoric , angry , anxious or apathetic . <unk> individuals may be unable to describe their subjective mood state . An individual who is unable to experience any pleasure may be suffering from anhedonia . 
 Affect is described by labelling the apparent emotion conveyed by the person 's nonverbal behavior ( anxious , sad etc . ) , and also by using the parameters of appropriateness , intensity , range , reactivity and mobility . Affect may be described as appropriate or inappropriate to the current situation , and as congruent or incongruent with their thought content . For example , someone who shows a bland affect when describing a very distressing experience would be described as showing incongruent affect , which might suggest schizophrenia . The intensity of the affect may be described as normal , blunted affect , exaggerated , flat , heightened or overly dramatic . A flat or blunted affect is associated with schizophrenia , depression or post @-@ traumatic stress disorder ; heightened affect might suggest mania , and an overly dramatic or exaggerated affect might suggest certain personality disorders . Mobility refers to the extent to which affect changes during the interview : the affect may be described as mobile , constricted , fixed , immobile or labile . The person may show a full range of affect , in other words a wide range of emotional expression during the assessment , or may be described as having restricted affect . The affect may also be described as reactive , in other words changing flexibly and appropriately with the flow of conversation , or as unreactive . A bland lack of concern for one 's disability may be described as showing la belle <unk> , a feature of conversion disorder , which is historically termed " hysteria " in older texts . 
 = = = Speech = = = 
 The patient 's speech is assessed by observing the patient 's spontaneous speech , and also by using structured tests of specific language functions . This heading is concerned with the production of speech rather than the content of speech , which is addressed under thought form and thought content ( see below ) . When observing the patient 's spontaneous speech , the interviewer will note and comment on <unk> features such as the loudness , rhythm , prosody , intonation , pitch , phonation , articulation , quantity , rate , spontaneity and latency of speech . A structured assessment of speech includes an assessment of expressive language by asking the patient to name objects , repeat short sentences , or produce as many words as possible from a certain category in a set time . Simple language tests form part of the mini @-@ mental state examination . In practice , the structured assessment of receptive and expressive language is often reported under Cognition ( see below ) . 
 Language assessment will allow the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria , neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia , and specific language disorders such as stuttering , cluttering or mutism . People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in <unk> and pragmatic aspects of their speech . Echolalia ( repetition of another person 's words ) and <unk> ( repetition of the subject 's own words ) can be heard with patients with autism , schizophrenia or Alzheimer 's disease . A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms , which are made @-@ up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them . Speech assessment also contributes to assessment of mood , for example people with mania or anxiety may have rapid , loud and pressured speech ; on the other hand depressed patients will typically have a prolonged speech latency and speak in a slow , quiet and hesitant manner . 
 = = = Thought process = = = 
 Thought process in the MSE refers to the quantity , tempo ( rate of flow ) and form ( or logical coherence ) of thought . Thought process cannot be directly observed but can only be described by the patient , or inferred from a patient 's speech . Regarding the tempo of thought , some people may experience flight of ideas , when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent , although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient 's speech . Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking , in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations . Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought <unk> refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas . A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder , and might be described more specifically as thought blocking , fusion , loosening of associations , tangential thinking , derailment of thought , or knight 's move thinking . Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions , but remains focused on the broad topic . Flight of ideas is typical of mania . Conversely , patients with depression may have retarded or inhibited thinking . Poverty of thought is one of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia , and might also be a feature of severe depression or dementia . A patient with dementia might also experience thought <unk> . Formal thought disorder is a common feature of schizophrenia . Circumstantial thinking might be observed in anxiety disorders or certain kinds of personality disorders . 
 = = = Thought content = = = 
 A description of thought content would describe a patient 's delusions , overvalued ideas , obsessions , phobias and preoccupations . Abnormalities of thought content are established by exploring individuals ' thoughts in an open @-@ ended conversational manner with regard to their intensity , salience , the emotions associated with the thoughts , the extent to which the thoughts are experienced as one 's own and under one 's control , and the degree of belief or conviction associated with the thoughts . 
 A delusion can be defined as " a false , unshakeable idea or belief which is out of keeping with the patient 's educational , cultural and social background ... held with extraordinary conviction and subjective certainty " , and is a core feature of psychotic disorders . The patient 's delusions may be described as persecutory or paranoid delusions , delusions of reference , grandiose delusions , <unk> delusions , delusional jealousy or delusional misidentification . Delusions may be described as mood @-@ congruent ( the delusional content in keeping with the mood ) , typical of manic or depressive psychoses , or mood @-@ incongruent ( delusional content not in keeping with the mood ) which are more typical of schizophrenia . Delusions of control , or passivity experiences ( in which the individual has the experience of the mind or body being under the influence or control of some kind of external force or agency ) , are typical of schizophrenia . Examples of this include experiences of thought withdrawal , thought insertion , thought broadcasting , and somatic passivity . Schneiderian first rank symptoms are a set of delusions and hallucinations which have been said to be highly suggestive of a diagnosis of schizophrenia . Delusions of guilt , delusions of poverty , and nihilistic delusions ( belief that one has no mind or is already dead ) are typical of depressive psychoses . 
 An overvalued idea is a false belief that is held with conviction but not with delusional intensity . <unk> is an overvalued idea that one is suffering from an illness , <unk> is an overvalued idea that a part of one 's body is abnormal , and people with anorexia nervosa may have an overvalued idea of being overweight . 
 An obsession is an " undesired , unpleasant , intrusive thought that cannot be suppressed through the patient 's volition " , but unlike passivity experiences described above , they are not experienced as imposed from outside the patient 's mind . Obsessions are typically intrusive thoughts of violence , injury , dirt or sex , or obsessive ruminations on intellectual themes . A person can also describe obsessional doubt , with intrusive worries about whether they have made the wrong decision , or forgotten to do something , for example turn off the gas or lock the house . In obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder , the individual experiences obsessions with or without compulsions ( a sense of having to carry out certain ritualized and senseless actions against their wishes ) . 
 A phobia is " a dread of an object or situation that does not in reality pose any threat " , and is distinct from a delusion in that the patient is aware that the fear is irrational . A phobia is usually highly specific to certain situations and will usually be reported by the patient rather than being observed by the clinician in the assessment interview . 
 <unk> are thoughts which are not fixed , false or intrusive , but have an undue prominence in the person 's mind . Clinically significant preoccupations would include thoughts of suicide , homicidal thoughts , suspicious or fearful beliefs associated with certain personality disorders , depressive beliefs ( for example that one is unloved or a failure ) , or the cognitive distortions of anxiety and depression . The MSE contributes to clinical risk assessment by including a thorough exploration of any suicidal or hostile thought content . Assessment of suicide risk includes detailed questioning about the nature of the person 's suicidal thoughts , belief about death , reasons for living , and whether the person has made any specific plans to end his or her life . 
 = = = Perceptions = = = 
 A perception in this context is any sensory experience , and the three broad types of perceptual disturbance are hallucinations , pseudohallucinations and illusions . A hallucination is defined as a sensory perception in the absence of any external stimulus , and is experienced in external or objective space ( i.e. experienced by the subject as real ) . An illusion is defined as a false sensory perception in the presence of an external stimulus , in other words a distortion of a sensory experience , and may be recognized as such by the subject . A <unk> is experienced in internal or subjective space ( for example as " voices in my head " ) and is regarded as akin to fantasy . Other sensory abnormalities include a distortion of the patient 's sense of time , for example déjà vu , or a distortion of the sense of self ( depersonalization ) or sense of reality ( derealization ) . 
 Hallucinations can occur in any of the five senses , although auditory and visual hallucinations are encountered more frequently than tactile ( touch ) , olfactory ( smell ) or gustatory ( taste ) hallucinations . Auditory hallucinations are typical of psychoses : third @-@ person hallucinations ( i.e. voices talking about the patient ) and hearing one 's thoughts spoken aloud ( <unk> or <unk> de la pensée ) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia , whereas second @-@ person hallucinations ( voices talking to the patient ) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide , may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia . Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy , drug intoxication or drug withdrawal . Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations , as they are distortions of sensory experiences , and are not experienced as existing in objective reality . Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders . Déjà vu , derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders . 
 = = = Cognition = = = 
 This section of the MSE covers the patient 's level of alertness , orientation , attention , memory , visuospatial functioning , language functions and executive functions . Unlike other sections of the MSE , use is made of structured tests in addition to unstructured observation . <unk> is a global observation of level of consciousness i.e. awareness of , and responsiveness to the environment , and this might be described as alert , clouded , drowsy , or <unk> . Orientation is assessed by asking the patient where he or she is ( for example what building , town and state ) and what time it is ( time , day , date ) . 
 Attention and concentration are assessed by the serial sevens test ( or alternatively by spelling a five @-@ letter word backwards ) , and by testing digit span . Memory is assessed in terms of immediate registration ( repeating a set of words ) , short @-@ term memory ( recalling the set of words after an interval , or recalling a short paragraph ) , and long @-@ term memory ( recollection of well known historical or geographical facts ) . Visuospatial functioning can be assessed by the ability to copy a diagram , draw a clock face , or draw a map of the consulting room . Language is assessed through the ability to name objects , repeat phrases , and by observing the individual 's spontaneous speech and response to instructions . Executive functioning can be screened for by asking the " similarities " questions ( " what do x and y have in common ? " ) and by means of a verbal fluency task ( e.g. " list as many words as you can starting with the letter F , in one minute " ) . The mini @-@ mental state examination is a simple structured cognitive assessment which is in widespread use as a component of the MSE . 
 Mild impairment of attention and concentration may occur in any mental illness where people are anxious and distractible ( including psychotic states ) , but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross disturbance of brain functioning such as delirium , dementia or intoxication . Specific language abnormalities may be associated with pathology in Wernicke 's area or Broca 's area of the brain . In Korsakoff 's syndrome there is dramatic memory impairment with relative preservation of other cognitive functions . Visuospatial or constructional abnormalities here may be associated with parietal lobe pathology , and abnormalities in executive functioning tests may indicate frontal lobe pathology . This kind of brief cognitive testing is regarded as a screening process only , and any abnormalities are more carefully assessed using formal neuropsychological testing . 
 The MSE may include a brief neuropsychiatric examination in some situations . Frontal lobe pathology is suggested if the person cannot repetitively execute a motor sequence ( e.g. " paper @-@ scissors @-@ stone " ) . The posterior columns are assessed by the person 's ability to feel the vibrations of a tuning fork on the wrists and ankles . The parietal lobe can be assessed by the person 's ability to identify objects by touch alone and with eyes closed . A cerebellar disorder may be present if the person cannot stand with arms extended , feet touching and eyes closed without swaying ( Romberg 's sign ) ; if there is a tremor when the person reaches for an object ; or if he or she is unable to touch a fixed point , close the eyes and touch the same point again . Pathology in the basal ganglia may be indicated by rigidity and resistance to movement of the limbs , and by the presence of characteristic involuntary movements . A lesion in the posterior fossa can be detected by asking the patient to roll his or her eyes upwards ( <unk> 's syndrome ) . Focal neurological signs such as these might reflect the effects of some prescribed psychiatric medications , chronic drug or alcohol use , head injuries , tumors or other brain disorders . 
 = = = Insight = = = 
 The person 's understanding of his or her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem , and understanding of the treatment options . In this context , insight can be said to have three components : recognition that one has a mental illness , compliance with treatment , and the ability to re @-@ label unusual mental events ( such as delusions and hallucinations ) as pathological . As insight is on a continuum , the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent , but should report the patient 's explanatory account descriptively . 
 Impaired insight is characteristic of psychosis and dementia , and is an important consideration in treatment planning and in assessing the capacity to consent to treatment . 
 = = = Judgment = = = 
 Judgment refers to the patient 's capacity to make sound , reasoned and responsible decisions . Traditionally , the MSE included the use of standard hypothetical questions such as " what would you do if you found a stamped , addressed envelope lying in the street ? " ; however contemporary practice is to inquire about how the patient has responded or would respond to real @-@ life challenges and contingencies . Assessment would take into account the individual 's executive system capacity in terms of impulsiveness , social cognition , self @-@ awareness and planning ability . 
 Impaired judgment is not specific to any diagnosis but may be a prominent feature of disorders affecting the frontal lobe of the brain . If a person 's judgment is impaired due to mental illness , there might be implications for the person 's safety or the safety of others . 
 = = Cultural considerations = = 
 There are potential problems when the MSE is applied in a cross @-@ cultural context , when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds . For example , the patient 's culture might have different norms for appearance , behavior and display of emotions . Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs need to be distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots . Cognitive assessment must also take the patient 's language and educational background into account . <unk> 's racial bias is another potential <unk> . 
 = = Children = = 
 There are particular challenges in carrying out an MSE with young children and others with limited language such as people with intellectual impairment . The examiner would explore and clarify the individual 's use of words to describe mood , thought content or perceptions , as words may be used idiosyncratically with a different meaning from that assumed by the examiner . In this group , tools such as play materials , puppets , art materials or diagrams ( for instance with multiple choices of facial expressions depicting emotions ) may be used to facilitate recall and explanation of experiences . 
 = Women 's Appreciation = 
 " Women 's Appreciation " is the twenty @-@ second episode of the third season of the US version of The Office , and the third supersized episode of the season . In this episode , Phyllis is flashed in the parking lot , so Michael takes all the women to the mall for " women 's appreciation " , where the status of his relationship with Jan comes to light . Meanwhile , Pam makes a sketch supposedly of the man who flashed Phyllis , when it in fact resembles Dwight , who is unaware and posts the fliers throughout town . 
 The episode was written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg and directed by Tucker Gates . While the characters travel to Mall at Steamtown , a shopping center in Scranton , Pennsylvania , filming actually took place in Los Angeles . Cast members Jenna Fischer and Kate Flannery enjoyed the three @-@ day shoot outside the office , and the latter was able to perform her own driving stunts . While filming , the cast were often met with fans " in full force " yelling out Steve Carell 's name and taking pictures . Retailer Victoria 's Secret agreed to close their mall store to the public to allow for episode filming . 
 " Women 's Appreciation " first aired in the United States on May 3 , 2007 . It garnered an estimated 7 @.@ 0 million viewers , causing it to rank fourth in its timeslot . Television critics gave mixed reviews to the episode . Comedic elements , such as Pam 's prank on Dwight , were praised , but one reviewer felt that Michael 's relationship problems with Jan came out of nowhere . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 After finding out that Phyllis Lapin ( Phyllis Smith ) was flashed in the parking lot , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) holds a misguided seminar on women 's issues . He closes the meeting by offering to take the women to the Mall at Steamtown . Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) orders Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) to interview Phyllis and make a sketch of " the pervert " . Pam draws a picture of Dwight with a moustache and without glasses . Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) assists an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with the " predator 's " face . 
 At the mall , Michael relates his discomfort with his relationship with Jan Levinson ( Melora Hardin ) . All of the women point out reasons for them to break up , except for Karen Filippelli ( Rashida Jones ) , who suggests that maybe they are " just having a rough patch " , obviously alluding to her own unstable relationship with Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) . Pam shoots the idea down by stating that " maybe you 're just wrong for each other " . Karen visibly takes this statement personally . Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria 's Secret . Pam is visibly upset when she overhears Phyllis helping Karen pick out a sexy outfit for Jim . Pam buys a robe because she is " between boyfriends " but can cut the robe into new hand towels . Later , she takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer 's ( Kate Flannery ) car . At the office , Kevin Malone ( Brian Baumgartner ) sneaks into the women 's bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room . The other men soon join him . 
 Upon returning to the office , Michael calls Jan to end their relationship , unwisely doing so by leaving a voicemail message . Jan walks into his office to apologize in person for their earlier conversation , but when she receives Michael 's voicemail , she storms out of the office . The episode ends with Jim calling Dwight , informing him he has information about the predator . He says he saw him two minutes before in the women 's bathroom . Dwight dashes to the bathroom and examines the room , looks in the mirror where someone had etched a moustache similar to the predator 's . Dwight realizes the prank and curses Pam . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Women 's Appreciation " was written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg , while Tucker Gates served as the episode 's director . The cold open featuring Jim receiving a demerit from Dwight was initially intended for " Business School " , and the opening of " Product Recall " , which featured Jim and Dwight impersonating each other , was first intended for this episode before it was moved because of time constraints . Michael 's talking head scene about Jan 's safeword was meant to serve as a " place holder " until a better version could be shot , but was left in the episode because the writers forgot about it . While the characters travel to Mall at Steamtown , a shopping center in Scranton , Pennsylvania , episode filming actually took place near Los Angeles , where the series is normally shot . 
 Kate Flannery , who plays Meredith , called the episode one of her favorites to shoot because she " was stuck in a van with Mindy Kaling , Jenna Fischer , Angela Kinsey , Rashida Jones , Phyllis Smith and Steve Carell for two days . " Fischer agreed , calling it a " fun episode to shoot " due to having three days of filming with Carell and The Office women . Believing Meredith 's minivan was " another character " in the series , Flannery enjoyed being able to drive and act simultaneously . In a reflection of the character 's personality , the production crew added props such as bottles of alcohol , chips , crushed soda cans , garbage , and 14 air fresheners to the vehicle . The cast however soon developed headaches , leading to the air fresheners ' removal . Flannery was able to perform her own stunts for the episode , explaining that she " was nervous at first , but I think I really could be a demolition @-@ derby star . " 
 The cast enjoyed shooting at the mall , but were faced with fans " in full force . " Crowds followed them while shooting , holding up camera phones and yelling Carell 's name . Flannery said of the episode , " We shot some really fun stuff with Steve and the ladies just running around the mall . The food @-@ court scene was so much fun . Steve is an amazing actor . " Lingerie retailer Victoria 's Secret agreed to close their store to the public for filming . In the episode , Angela reveals that she wears large sizes of clothes purchased from American Girl , a doll store chain , but will not shop at children 's retailer Gap Kids because it is " too flashy . " In the DVD audio commentary , Kinsey remarked that after the episode broadcast , people would bring up American Girl Doll catalogs for her to sign . <unk> also yelled out Carell 's name during the scene where Pam changes a tire . 
 The Season Three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes . Notable cut scenes include Kelly learning that Phyllis got flashed , Bob Vance , Vance Refrigeration , calming down Phyllis , Andy trying to earn back Dwight 's favor by bonding over cold soups , Michael imagining himself as a woman , Dwight escorting the women to Meredith 's car , Michael choosing lingerie for Pam , and an alternate version of Michael 's concluding talking head . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The episode first broadcast in the United States on May 3 , 2007 on NBC in a special timeslot , airing behind an episode of My Name Is Earl . " Women 's Appreciation " was a " supersized " episode , as it aired for forty minutes . It attracted an estimated 7 @.@ 0 million viewers , and ranked fourth in its timeslot , behind episodes of Survivor : Fiji , Ugly Betty , and Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader ? . 
 The episode received mixed reviews from television critics . IGN writer Brian Zoromski called " Women 's Appreciation " a " fairly solid episode worthy of the super @-@ sized treatment , " and rated it 7 @.@ 9 out of 10 . He highlighted Pam 's prank as well as Michael 's attempt to break up with Jan via voicemail , calling the latter " easily the funniest moment in the episode , and perfectly played by both Steve Carell and Melora Hardin . " Zoromski did however criticize the series for abandoning plot points , such as the publicity fiasco from the previous episode . Give Me My Remote 's Kath Skerry called it a " hilarious episode , " and observed " I don ’ t think The Office has ever pushed the envelope in terms of sexual discussion as much as it did tonight . " 
 Jay Black from AOL TV disliked the episode 's awkward moments and thought Michael 's unhappiness with Jan came out of nowhere . Black did however praise Pam 's prank as well as Dwight himself , but concluded his review : " A surprisingly weak handling of character combined with fewer laugh @-@ out @-@ loud moments than I 'm used to forces me to give this episode 4 Creed number @-@ twos out of 7 . " Entertainment Weekly staff writer Abby West also critiqued " Women 's Appreciation " , explaining that it " felt exactly like a 30 @-@ minute episode stretched to fill 43 minutes . " She thought the episode " only came together " once the Office women performed an intervention for Michael . 
 = The Sleeping Girl of Turville = 
 Ellen Sadler ( May 15 , 1859 – after 1901 ) , sometimes called The Sleeping Girl of Turville , was a resident of Turville , a small village in Buckinghamshire in the United Kingdom . In 1871 , aged eleven , she purportedly fell asleep and did not wake for nine years . The case attracted international attention from newspapers , medical professionals and the public . 
 Born to a large , impoverished family of farm workers , Ellen was sent to work as a nursemaid at the age of eleven . Soon afterwards , she began suffering periods of drowsiness and was referred to a local hospital . After four months her condition was declared incurable , and she was sent home . Two days later , Ellen had a series of seizures and — her mother claimed — fell into a deep sleep from which she could not be roused . 
 Ellen became a tourist attraction for the village , and her family made considerable money from visitors ' donations . As the years progressed with no sign of Ellen 's waking , speculation grew that her illness was either a hoax or caused by her mother , an issue that was never resolved . In late 1880 , soon after her mother 's death , Ellen awoke . She later married and had at least five children . 
 = = Background = = 
 Ellen Sadler was born on May 15 , 1859 to Ann and William Sadler , who lived in the small village of Turville , Buckinghamshire . The <unk> were a large , impoverished family consisting mainly of farmhands ; Ellen , the youngest child , shared her home with her eleven siblings . Ellen 's father died while she was an infant ; Ann Sadler subsequently married Thomas Frewen . 
 = = Illness = = 
 = = = Initial symptoms = = = 
 In 1870 , aged eleven , Ellen began work as a nursemaid in nearby Marlow , but she began suffering periods of somnolence and her employment was terminated . She was subsequently attended by a local doctor , Henry Hayman <unk> , from nearby <unk> . Ellen had been suffering for 13 weeks from " glandular swellings " or an abscess on the back of her head , and symptoms consistent with a spinal disease . The family did not have much money , so the parish vicar , The Reverend Studholme , asked Hayman to secure Ellen 's admission to a local hospital , where her condition worsened . Ellen stayed at the hospital for 18 weeks before being " discharged as incurable " in March 1871 . 
 = = = Fall into unconsciousness = = = 
 According to Ellen 's mother , upon the girl 's return home on a rickety cart , she began to feel drowsy and had several seizures . Hayman states that it was two days after her discharge that the seizures occurred . He visited Ellen at her home , where he was told that the previous night , March 17 , Ellen had endured a series of such attacks , after which she turned to lie " on her left side , with her hand under her head , and the lower extremities drawn upwards " . It was in this position that — her mother maintained — Ellen remained for the duration of her sleep . Hayman visited Ellen many times over the next few years and he later said that he " never found her otherwise " . 
 Ellen became something of a tourist attraction for Turville . She was visited by journalists , medical professionals , religious personnel and the " plain curious " from across the country , many of whom donated money to Ellen 's family to be allowed to see her . Some paid to take cuts of Ellen 's hair , until the " supply " began to run out . A Bucks Free Press journalist recounted his visit : 
 Her breathing was regular and natural , the skin soft and the body warm , as in a healthy subject ; the pulse rather fast . The hands were small and thin , but the fingers quite flexible ; the body somewhat emaciated ; the feet and legs like those of a dead child , almost ice cold ... the aspect of her features was pleasant , more so than might be expected under the circumstances ... her eyes and cheeks were sunken , and the appearance was that of death ... but although there was no colour on her cheeks , the paleness was not that heavy hue which betokens death . 
 A correspondent from The Daily Telegraph visited Ellen about 22 months after she fell ill . He wrote : 
 The girl 's face is by no means cadaverous . There is flesh on the cheeks , which have a pinkish tint , and there is some colour in the thin lips . The eyes are calmly closed , as though in healthy sleep . I ventured to raise one of the lids and touch the eye beneath ... but there was not even a quivering of the eyelash . ... The girl 's [ hand ] was quite warm and moist , and the finger nails were neatly trimmed . The fingers are not the least bit stiffened ... It is not a skeleton hand , neither are any of the girl 's limbs so emaciated as , under the extraordinary circumstances alleged , might be expected . ... The child 's body is very thin as compared with her limbs . ... There is not much substance in her flesh , however ; it is soft and flabby ... [ Her feet were ] almost ice @-@ cold . ... As regards the child 's breathing , it is so feeble that it is almost impossible to detect it ; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek to her mouth , and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart . 
 By March 1873 , Ellen was believed to be suffering from starvation . At first , she had largely subsisted on port , tea and milk , given three times per day . After about 15 months — while her mother was attempting to administer arrowroot — Ellen 's jaw locked closed . Subsequently , according to Hayman , she was fed " wine , gruel and other things " using the " spout of a toy teapot inserted between two broken teeth " . The Daily Telegraph journalist expanded on Ellen 's feeding : " The feeding implements stand on a little table by the side of the stump bedstead , and , at first sight , give you the idea that they are toys placed there to attract her attention should she , by a merciful termination of her trance , presently awake to life . The toys in question are two tiny ' teapots ' , each not much larger than a full @-@ sized walnut and holding four small <unk> . One of these is filled with port wine , and the other with milk ... this quantity of liquid nourishment ... cannot weigh more than half an ounce ... " At this time , it was considered " manifestly out of the question to think of moving her " . How the family dealt with Ellen 's passing of urine and faeces is unclear , but in 1880 , Hayman said that Ann Frewen told him that no bowel movements had occurred for five years , and that approximately every four days " a somewhat large amount would pass from the bladder " . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Some visitors were sceptical of Ellen 's illness and attempted to uncover the alleged ruse through methods such as stabbing her with pins , to no effect . The Bucks Free Press journalist was suspicious of Ann 's practice of making visitors wait before seeing Ellen . Some neighbours were also " deeply sceptical " , as Ellen 's family was making a " healthy profit " from her illness . During summers , the family was taking as much as £ 2 per week ( £ 180 as of 2016 ) . Others said they sometimes saw Ellen sitting by her window at night . Ann consented to " fair tests " , but further suspicions were raised because medical personnel were not allowed to remain for too long , and Ann did not want Ellen to be moved to a hospital . Nor was Ellen listed as an invalid during the 1871 census . Hayman said that Ann was reluctant to allow handling of her daughter by medical personnel because they often concealed sharp objects with which to " test [ Ellen 's ] powers of feeling " . Her parents had also " strenuously opposed " Hayman 's recommendation to run an electric current through Ellen 's sleeping body . 
 Much speculation appeared in the press as to the cause of Ellen 's illness ; some linked the case to that of Sarah Jacob , a girl from Wales who , her parents claimed , was able to survive without nourishment , through divine intervention . Sarah died of starvation in 1869 , and her parents were subsequently convicted of manslaughter . A journalist for The Observer commented , " It is to be hoped that [ Sarah 's case ] is known in the obscure village of Turville , where — we are asked to believe — a fresh case of miraculous trance has taken place . ... [ Ellen 's case ] very much ... incites suspicion of deliberate imposture . " One correspondent to The Times wrote , " It is by widespread publicity that such cases are multiplied , and it is difficult to overstate the harm thus done . These impostures exist through a morbid love of sympathy on the part of the children , or from the gains that accrue to the parents . Once begun , they soon pass into real disease . " Another said the " ridiculous mystery " could be resolved if only Ellen were transferred , over her mother 's continued objections , to a London hospital , a sentiment echoed by many . Claims that Ellen was suffering from a form of catalepsy — a condition at the time considered " so rare that not one physician in a thousand has so much as seen a single case of it " — were also disregarded as unlikely , as was any thought of religious ecstasy . 
 Nevertheless , Hayman affirmed , " every effort [ had ] been made to discover the deception , if any , but without effect . " The Home Secretary and local Magistrate corresponded about the case but the law was powerless to interfere , because despite accepting donations , Ellen 's family never asked for money outright , and she " was not represented as a ' fasting girl ' " , as Sarah Jacob had been . The Daily Telegraph journalist said , " [ Ann Frewen ] ' s manner is that of a perfectly honest woman who would be too glad if her child could be restored to consciousness . " He spoke to neighbours , none of whom indicated anything other than trust in Ellen 's parents and Hayman , and claimed that the family was receiving no money from Ellen 's illness , although the latter point is contradicted by Hayman and others . The journalist concluded , " I have no medical knowledge , and [ am ] unqualified to give an opinion beyond what is justified by close observation of the ordinary kind . I went to Turville prepared to find an imposture . I have returned — puzzled . "

 Ann Frewen died in May 1880 . The inquest into her death was held at the nearby Bull and Butcher public house , presided over by the county coroner , Frederick Charsley . Part of the inquest 's remit was to consider the matter of Ellen 's subsequent care . Thomas Frewen was reported as being " quite evasive " when the coroner asked him how Ellen was fed , and although Hayman testified to reaffirm his stance that Ellen 's illness was genuine , Reverend Studholme was less certain . However , he could not offer any evidence to this effect , even though he had made several unannounced visits to Ellen 's home . Charsley concluded that Thomas could not look after Ellen , as his job left him absent from their home all day , and that the other members of the household would be too busy with its upkeep . Therefore , he turned Ellen 's care over to her married sisters , Elizabeth Stacey and Grace Blackall , both of whom lived in Turville . The cause of Ann 's death was found to be oedema of the heart , from which she had been suffering for many years . 
 Five months later , Ellen awoke ; by November , she had " fully recovered " . By this time , Ellen was twenty @-@ one and claimed to remember nothing of the previous nine years . She otherwise suffered few long @-@ term effects , save for slightly stunted growth and a " weak eye " . 
 = = Later life and legacy = = 
 In 1886 , Ellen married Mark Blackall in nearby Fawley . In the censuses of 1891 and 1901 , the pair are listed as living in Barkham and Caversham , respectively . They had five children : Ann ( b . 1888 ) , Elizabeth or Mable ( b . 1889 ) , Gladys ( b . 1890 ) , Sydney ( b . 1896 ) and Gertrude ( b . 1898 ) . Ellen and Mark appear in the 1911 census together with Sydney and Gertrude , all living in Lower Caversham . The census also records that they had six children of which one had died . The case of Ellen Sadler has remained a part of local folklore , spawning tales of witchcraft and rumours of royal attention in Turville . The Sadler family home became known as " Sleepy Cottage " , and was used for filming of the BBC situation comedy The Vicar of Dibley . No clear cause has ever been ascribed for Ellen 's condition ; modern diagnoses might include narcolepsy , or deliberate drugging , and the possibility that it was a hoax cannot be discounted . An embellished account of the story can be found in the 1973 collection , Witchcraft in the Thames Valley by Tony Barham .

 Greaves Motorsport is a British racing team , currently competing in the European Le Mans Series and the 24 Hours of Le Mans . 
 In 2006 , Greaves Motorsport , founded and run by Tim Greaves , entered the Le Mans Series ( LMS ) for the first time , running a Radical SR9 in conjunction with Radical , and competing under the Bruichladdich Radical banner . After four years of running Radicals in both the LMS and the 24 Hours of Le Mans , the team , now known as Team Bruichladdich , purchased a Ginetta @-@ Zytek <unk> / 2 in 2010 to replace the old Radical SR9 . In 2011 , the team became known as Greaves Motorsport , and they switched to the new Zytek Z11SN , winning the LMP2 category of both the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Le Mans Series . For 2012 , they entered the new European Le Mans Series ( ELMS ) and FIA World Endurance Championship ( WEC ) , finishing third in the LMP2 category of the ELMS , and fifth in the WEC .

 In 2006 , it was announced that Greaves Motorsport would be running the works Radical team in the Le Mans Series ( LMS ) , with Tim Greaves and Stuart Moseley driving a LMP2 @-@ class Radical SR9 @-@ AER under the Bruichladdich Radical banner . The team entered the 1000 km of Nürburgring , and finished fifteenth overall , fifth in class . Ben Devlin joined the team for the following round , the 1000 km of Donington , but the team retired after 151 laps . Following this race , the team entered Greaves , Moseley , Ben Devlin and Colin McRae in the inaugural round of the Radical World Cup . McRae 's weekend proved unsuccessful , as he retired from the first race , and finished eleventh in the second . Having returned to the LMS , the team retired from the season 's final race , the 1000 km of Jarama , after 27 laps . Following this , Moseley and Michael <unk> were entered in the American Le Mans Series season finale at Laguna Seca , where they finished 22nd , and fifth in class . 
 In 2007 , Bruichladdich Radical competed in the entire LMS season . Having retired at the opening event , the 1000 km of Monza , the team took a ninth place overall finish and third in class at the 1000 km of Valencia ; in the latter race , Greaves and Moseley were joined by Robin Liddell . Following this event , the team participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time , however , Tim Greaves crashed out after 90 minutes , forcing the team to withdraw . The following LMS race , which was the 1000 km of Nürburgring , was little more successful ; Greaves and Moseley finished 35th , and ninth in class , after a starter motor problem had cost the team around 30 minutes . A retirement at the 1000 km of Spa followed , due to engine failure after 81 laps , before the season finale , the 1000 km of Silverstone saw the team take 14th overall and seventh in class ; Jacob Greaves filling the third driver 's slot for the team . The team finished joint @-@ eighth in the LMP2 team 's standings ; level with Team LNT and Kruse Motorsport on eight points . 
 = = = 2008 – 2009 = = = 
 Bruichladdich Radical remained in the Le Mans Series in 2008 , but had an all @-@ new driver line @-@ up of Jens Petersen , Jan @-@ Dirk <unk> and Marc <unk> . The season opener , which was the 1000 km of Catalunya , saw the team finish 15th overall , and seventh in class . However , the rest of the season was unsuccessful , as the team did not finish above 30th overall in any of the remaining LMS races , or the 24 Hours of Le Mans ; although 30th at the 1000 km of Spa equated to seventh in class , due to attrition . As a result , the team slipped to joint @-@ eleventh in class , with four points . 
 For 2009 , Pierre Bruneau joined the team , and as a result , the team became known as the Bruichladdich @-@ Bruneau Team , with the team continuing to use the AER @-@ engined Radical SR9 . The opening round of the season , which was the 1000 km of Catalunya , saw Bruneau , partnered by Moseley and Nigel <unk> , finishing tenth overall , and fourth in the LM P2 category . At the 1000 km of Spa , Tim Greaves and Jonathon Coleman replaced Moseley and <unk> , but the team were disqualified from the event for an unspecified technical infringement . <unk> partnered Greaves and Bruneau at the 24 Hours of Le Mans , but retired from the race after just over fourteen and a half hours , having completed 91 laps . At the 1000 km of Algarve , Greaves and Bruneau were partnered by Francesco Sini , but could only finish 25th overall , and tenth in class . Michael <unk> replaced Greaves at the 1000 km of Nürburgring , but the team retired after 114 laps . Greaves returned for the 1000 km of Silverstone , the season finale ; the team finished 16th overall , and sixth in class . The team were classified seventh in the LM P2 standings , with eight points . 
 = = = 2010 – 2011 = = = 
 In 2010 , the team ended their association with Radical , and replaced the SR9 with a LM P2 class Ginetta @-@ Zytek <unk> / 2 ; Tim Greaves , Karim Ojjeh and Thor @-@ Christian Ebbesvik were named as the team 's regular drivers , resulting in the team being known as Team Bruichladdich . The team 's first race with the car came at the LMS opener , the 8 Hours of Castellet , and they finished twelfth overall , fifth in class . The 1000 km of Spa proved to be less successful ; the team suffered a blown engine during qualifying , and Ebbesvik crashed out of the race after 15 laps . For the 24 Hours of Le Mans , Gary Chalandon replaced Ebbesvik , and the team finished tenth overall , fifth in the LM P2 class . Next up was the 1000 km of Algarve , and Ebbesvik returned to the team ; fifth overall , and second in class , for their first class podium of the season . The 1000 km of Hungaroring saw another fifth place overall , although mechanical difficulties with the LM P1 @-@ class cars meant that this also equated to fifth in class . The season finale , which was the 1000 km of Silverstone , saw the team end the season with a 19th overall , and eighth in class . The team finished the season ranked fifth in the LMP2 Team 's Championship , with 46 points . 
 In 2011 , the team changed their name to Greaves Motorsport , and were the first team to use the new LM P2 @-@ class Zytek Z11SN @-@ Nissan . With Ojjeh , Chalandon and Tom Kimber @-@ Smith driving the car , the team won the LM P2 class and came third overall at the 6 Hours of Castellet , which was the first round of the season . Although the team struggled at the 1000 km of Spa , finishing 37th overall , and eighth in class , the team won the LM P2 category of the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time , and finished eighth overall ; Chalandon was replaced by Olivier Lombard from this event onwards . Another eighth place overall , and class victory followed , at the 6 Hours of Imola ; the team then won the LM P2 class for the third race in a row at the 6 Hours of Silverstone , this time finishing tenth overall . The team finished the season with a fourth overall , and second in class , at the 6 Hours of Estoril ; this meant that the team won the LM P2 Championship , with Kimber @-@ Smith and Ojjeh being crowned as the LM P2 Driver 's Champions . 
 = = = 2012 – 2013 = = = 
 In 2012 , Greaves Motorsport entered both the European Le Mans Series ( ELMS ) and the new FIA World Endurance Championship ( WEC ) . Kimber @-@ Smith , Alex Brundle and Lucas Ordóñez were hired for the ELMS , whilst Elton Julian , Christian Zugel and Ricardo González were hired for the WEC . The team 's first event of the season came at the 12 Hours of Sebring , which formed part of the WEC and the American Le Mans Series ( ALMS ) ; the team finished seventh of the WEC runners , and fourth in the LMP2 category . The team then entered the opening round of the ELMS , which was the 6 Hours of Castellet ; the team finished fourth overall , and in the LM P2 class . The next event the team entered was the 6 Hours of Spa @-@ Francorchamps , part of the WEC ; the team finished 16th overall , and seventh in the LM P2 class . For the 24 Hours of Le Mans , Greaves Motorsport entered two cars ; Zugel , Julian and González in the No. 41 car , and Alex Brundle , Martin Brundle and Ordóñez in the No. 42 car . The No. 41 car finished 12th overall , and fifth in class , whilst the No. 42 car finished 15th overall , and eighth in class . Next , the team returned to the ELMS , competing in the 6 Hours of Donington , finishing seventh overall and in the LM P2 class . The team then entered both cars in the 6 Hours of Silverstone , with the same drivers that had competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans ; the No. 42 car finished 12th overall , and fifth in the LM P2 category , whilst the No. 41 car finished 20th overall , and 13th in class . Greaves Motorsport reverted to a single @-@ car entry for the 6 Hours of São Paulo round of the WEC , with Roberto González replacing his brother Ricardo ( whom had been selected to drive for Level 5 Motorsports instead ) ; the team finished eleventh overall , and fourth in the LM P2 class . Ricardo González returned to the team for the 6 Hours of Bahrain , and the team finished twelfth overall , seventh in the LMP2 category . The 6 Hours of Fuji was the team 's next race , and they finished 14th overall , and seventh in class . Greaves Motorsport then entered the final race of the ELMS season , which was the Petit Le Mans ( also part of the ALMS ) ; Alex Brundle , Kimber @-@ Smith and Alex Buncombe were selected to drive , and they finished 32nd overall , fifth in the P2 class . The team finished the 2012 season by competing in the 6 Hours of Shanghai , which was part of the WEC ; they finished 15th overall , and eighth in class . In the WEC , Greaves Motorsport were classified fifth in the LM P2 trophy , with 99 points ; whilst in the ELMS , they were classified third in the LM P2 standings , with 48 points . 
 In 2013 , Greaves Motorsport once again entered both the ELMS and the WEC . Chris Dyson and Michael <unk> were hired for the first round of the ELMS , whilst Dyson and <unk> were joined by Kimber @-@ Smith for the WEC . The team started the 2013 season by entering the opening round of the ELMS , which was the 3 Hours of Silverstone on 13 April ; the team retired after 23 laps . They then entered the 6 Hours of Silverstone , which was part of the WEC and held the following day ; this time , the team finished eleventh overall , and fifth in class . The next event the team entered was the 6 Hours of Spa @-@ Francorchamps , which was part of the WEC ; however , the team withdrew from the event after Dyson crashed heavily in qualifying , leaving the car too damaged to race . The team then returned to the ELMS , and entered the 3 Hours of Imola ; Kimber @-@ Smith and David <unk> Hansson were selected to drive , and they finished fifth overall , and in class . For the 24 Hours of Le Mans , Greaves Motorsport once again entered two cars ; Kimber @-@ Smith , Alexander Rossi and Eric Lux in the No. 41 car , whilst Ordóñez , Michael Krumm and Jann <unk> drove the No. 42 car . As Greaves Motorsport had signed a deal with Caterham , the No. 41 car was entered under the Caterham Motorsport banner . In the race , the No. 42 car proved to be the quicker of the two ; Krumm , <unk> and Ordóñez finished ninth overall , and third in the LM P2 class , whilst the Caterham Motorsport car finished 23rd overall , and tenth in the LM P2 class . Although the team initially entered the Caterham @-@ backed car in the 3 Hours of Red Bull Ring , part of the ELMS , they were forced to withdraw after they were unable to find any drivers to run ; this was the first time the team had withdrawn from an ELMS event since their first race in the series , back in 2006 . Zugel and Jeannette were partnered by Björn Wirdheim for the 6 Hours of São Paulo , which was part of the WEC ; although they were running third at one point of the race , they eventually finished seventh overall , and fourth in the LM P2 category . The team then attempted to return to the ELMS , by entering the 3 Hours of Hungaroring , but did not register any drivers or attend the event . Zugel , Dyson and Kimber @-@ Smith drove in the 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas , part of the WEC , and took fifth in the LM P2 category , and ninth overall . For the 6 Hours of Fuji , Greaves Motorsport announced a partnership with local Super GT team Gainer , which resulted in Gainer 's Katsuyuki <unk> partnering Björn Wirdheim and Masayuki Ueda ; the combined effort was entered under the " Gainer International " banner . The race was halted at around the three @-@ hour mark due to torrential rain , and the team were classified sixth overall , and third in class . The 6 Hours of Shanghai saw Greaves Motorsport hand Mark Shulzhitskiy his WEC debut , driving alongside Lux and Wirdheim ; the trio took another fifth place in class for the team , and ninth overall . The final round of the WEC season , which was the 6 Hours of Bahrain , saw Wolfgang <unk> make his debut in the series with Greaves Motorsport ; he was partnered by fellow debutant Jon Lancaster and <unk> . Despite the team 's inexperience , they were able to finish third in the LM P2 class , and fifth overall . The team finished the year classified fifth in the LM P2 category of the WEC , with 81 points , and ninth in the ELMS , with ten points . 
 = = = 2014 – 2015 = = = 
 In 2014 , Greaves Motorsport returned to the ELMS , once again campaigning two Zytek <unk> . After the team 's failure to secure a guaranteed spot at the 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans , Caterham withdrew their backing of Greaves Motorsport . At the 4 Hours of Silverstone , the team fielded three ELMS and LM P2 category débutantes ; Matt McMurry , James Littlejohn , and Tony Wells . It was to be a successful début for all three drivers ; McMurry , partnered by Dyson and Kimber @-@ Smith , finished fourth , whilst Littlejohn and Wells were partnered by James Walker and finished sixth . Littlejohn had actually lead the race at one point , and both he and McMurry were nominated for " Driver of the Day " by Radio Le Mans . For the 4 Hours of Imola , Greaves entered one car , driven by Kimber @-@ Smith and McMurry ; for the second race in succession , they finished fourth . Greaves Motorsport had two entries at the 24 Hours of Le Mans ; the # 41 car , which was driven by James Winslow , Alessandro Latif and Michael <unk> under their own name , and the # 42 car , which was driven by McMurry ( who became the youngest ever competitor at the event ) , Dyson and Kimber @-@ Smith under the Caterham Racing banner . Although the # 41 car was forced to retire due to suspension damage after <unk> crashed , the # 42 car was able to finish tenth in class , and 25th overall . Greaves Motorsport then returned to the ELMS for the 4 Hours of Red Bull Ring , where Luciano Bacheta and Mark Shulzhitskiy drove one car , and Kimber @-@ Smith , Mark Patterson and McMurry drove the other ; the two entries finished fourth and sixth respectively . The next race , which was the 4 Hours of Castellet , proved to be a mixed bag ; whilst Shulzhitskiy and Bacheta were able to challenge for the lead before eventually finishing fifth , the car of McMurry and Johnny Mowlem crashed out of the race at the first corner . At the final race of the season , which was the 4 Hours of Estoril , the team had another mixed race ; Shulzhitskiy and Bacheta were running third before an incident whilst lapping GT cars led to their eventual retirement , whilst McMurry , Miguel <unk> and James Fletcher took seventh place . Greaves Motorsport finished the season fourth in the LM P2 Team 's standings , tied with Morand Racing on 68 points . 
 On 16 December 2014 , it was announced that Greaves Motorsport would be competing in the LM P2 class of both the ELMS and the FIA WEC for the 2015 season , subject to their application 's approval , with Gibson Technology 's updated version of the Zytek Z11SN , renamed as the Gibson <unk> . 
 = High Virgo = 
 The High Virgo , also known as Weapons System 199C ( WS @-@ 199C ) , was a prototype air @-@ launched ballistic missile ( ALBM ) jointly developed by Lockheed and the Convair division of General Dynamics during the late 1950s . The missile proved moderately successful and aided in the development of the later GAM @-@ 87 Skybolt ALBM ; in addition , it was used in early test of anti @-@ satellite weapons . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 As part of the WS @-@ 199 project to develop new strategic weapons for the United States Air Force 's Strategic Air Command , the Lockheed Corporation and the Convair division of General Dynamics proposed the development of an air @-@ launched ballistic missile , to be carried by the Convair B @-@ 58 Hustler supersonic medium bomber . In early 1958 the two companies were awarded a contract for development of the weapon , designated WS @-@ 199C and given the code @-@ name " High Virgo " . While the project was intended to be strictly a research @-@ and @-@ development exercise , it was planned that the weapon would be quickly capable of being developed into an operational system if required . 
 The High Virgo missile was a single @-@ stage weapon , powered by a solid @-@ fueled Thiokol TX @-@ 20 rocket , and was equipped an advanced inertial guidance system derived from that of the AGM @-@ 28 Hound Dog cruise missile . Four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided directional control . The missile was developed by Lockheed , utilising components developed for several existing missiles in order to reduce the cost of the project , and also to reduce the development time required , while Convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of the missile from the prototype B @-@ 58 , the pylon replacing the aircraft 's normal weapons pod . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 Four test flights of the High Virgo missile were conducted ; due to development problems , the first two did not include the inertial guidance system , instead being fitted with a simple autopilot guiding the weapon on a pre @-@ programmed course . Launched from its B @-@ 58 carrier aircraft at high altitude and supersonic speed , the initial flight , conducted on September 5 , 1958 , was a failure when the missile 's controls malfunctioned ; the second test , three months later , proved more successful , with the missile flying over a range of nearly 200 miles ( 320 km ) . The third flight test , the following June , utilized the inertial guidance system for the first time ; it , too , was a successful flight . 
 = = = Anti @-@ satellite test = = = 
 The fourth High Virgo missile was utilized in a test mission intended to demonstrate the capability of the missile for use as a " satellite interceptor " , or anti @-@ satellite missile ( ASAT ) . the missile , modified with cameras to record the results of the test , was initially targeted at the Explorer 4 satellite , but due to errors in calculating the satellite 's orbit Explorer 5 was targeted instead . 
 The ASAT test mission , the final flight of the High Virgo missile , was conducted on September 22 , 1959 ; less than a minute after the launch of the missile from its B @-@ 58 carrier aircraft at Mach 2 , the telemetry signal was lost . No data was recovered from the test , and the camera data , intended to be recovered afterward , was not located ; therefore the test was inconclusive . 
 No further test firings of High Virgo were conducted , the research project having been concluded . However the Air Force was already undertaking work on what would become the GAM @-@ 87 Skybolt missile , which incorporated lessons learned from the WS @-@ 199 project in its construction .

 = Pelagic stingray = 
 The pelagic stingray ( Pteroplatytrygon violacea ) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae , and the sole member of its genus . It is characterized by the wedge @-@ like shape of its pectoral fin disc , which is much wider than long , as well as by the pointed teeth in both sexes , whip @-@ like tail with extremely long tail spine , and uniform violet to blue @-@ green coloration . It generally reaches 59 cm ( 23 in ) in width . The pelagic stingray has a worldwide distribution in waters warmer than 19 ° C ( 66 ° F ) , and migrates seasonally to spend the summer closer to the continental shelf and at higher latitudes . The only stingray that almost exclusively inhabits the open ocean , this species is typically found in surface waters down to a depth of 100 m ( 330 ft ) . As a consequence of its midwater habits , its swimming style has evolved to feature more of a flapping motion of the pectoral fins , as opposed to the disc margin undulations used by other , bottom @-@ dwelling stingrays . 
 The diet of the pelagic stingray consists of free @-@ swimming invertebrates and bony fishes . It is an active hunter , using its pectoral fins to trap and move food to its mouth , and has been known to take advantage of seasonal feeding opportunities such as spawning squid . Like other stingrays , it is aplacental viviparous , meaning that the embryos are sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) . With a short gestation period of 2 – 4 months , females may bear two litters of 4 – 13 pups per year . Birthing generally occurs in warm water near the equator , with the exception of the Mediterranean Sea , with the timing varying between regions . Rarely encountered except by fishery workers , the pelagic stingray can inflict a severe , even fatal wound with its tail spine . This species is caught as bycatch throughout its range ; it is of little economic value and usually discarded , often with high mortality . However , there is evidence that its numbers are increasing , perhaps owing to the heavy fishing of its natural predators and competitors ( e.g. , sharks ) . Along with the pelagic stingray 's global distribution and prolific life history , this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) to assess it as of Least Concern . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The pelagic stingray was originally described by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in the 1832 third volume of <unk> della fauna <unk> per le quattro <unk> degli <unk> <unk> . He named it Trygon violacea , from the Latin viola ( " purple " ) , and designated two specimens collected off Italy as the species syntypes . The genus Trygon has since been synonymized with Dasyatis . In 1910 , American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler placed the pelagic stingray in the newly created subgenus Pteroplatytrygon , from the Greek pteron ( " fin " ) , <unk> ( " broad " ) , and trygon ( " stingray " ) . Later authors elevated <unk> to the rank of full genus , though some taxonomists dispute whether this species is distinct enough to warrant separation from Dasyatis . 
 Lisa Rosenberger 's 2001 phylogenetic analysis , based on morphology , found that the pelagic stingray is one of the more basal members of its family , being the sister taxon to a clade that contains <unk> , Dasyatis , and Indo @-@ Pacific Himantura species . Other common names for the pelagic stingray include the blue stingray and the violet stingray . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The distribution of the pelagic stingray extends nearly worldwide in tropical to warm @-@ temperate pelagic waters , between the latitudes of 52 ° N and 50 ° S. In the western Atlantic , it has been reported from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to North Carolina , the northern Gulf of Mexico , and the Lesser Antilles , Brazil and Uruguay . In the eastern Atlantic , this species has been recorded from the North Sea to Madeira , including the Mediterranean Sea , as well as around Cape Verde , in the Gulf of Guinea and off South Africa . In the Pacific , it is known from Japan to Australia and New Zealand in the west , British Columbia to Chile in the west , and around many oceanic islands including Hawaii , the Galápagos , and Easter Island . There have been no reports of this species from much of the Indian Ocean , but it is known to be common in the southwestern portion and around Indonesia . 
 Unique amongst stingrays in inhabiting the open ocean rather than the sea floor , the pelagic stingray is generally found from the surface to a depth of 100 m ( 330 ft ) over deep water . It has also been caught at a depth of 330 – 381 m ( 1 @,@ 083 – 1 @,@ 250 ft ) over the Kyushu @-@ Palau Ridge , indicating that it at least occasionally approaches the bottom . This species prefers water temperatures above 19 ° C ( 66 ° F ) , and will die if the temperature drops to 15 ° C ( 59 ° F ) . 
 The pelagic stingray performs seasonal migrations following warm water masses . In the northwestern Atlantic , it is found in or near the Gulf Stream from December to April , and moves north of the Stream to gather near the continental shelf from July to September . A similar migration seems to occur in the Mediterranean , though the specifics are unknown . In the Pacific , this species apparently spends the winter in oceanic waters near the equator and move into higher latitudes and towards the coast in spring . Two Pacific populations are known : one migrates from near Central America to California , and the other from the central Pacific to as far as Japan and British Columbia . Off southeastern Brazil , pelagic stingrays are displaced towards the coast by upwellings of cold water in late spring and summer ; in some years they may even be pushed into inshore waters less than 45 m ( 148 ft ) deep . 
 = = Description = = 
 The pelagic stingray has a very thick , distinctively wedge @-@ shaped pectoral fin disc one @-@ third wider than long , with broadly curved leading margins , rather angular outer corners , and nearly straight trailing margins . The snout is short with a rounded tip . The eyes are minute and , unlike in other stingrays , do not protrude above the body ; the spiracles ( paired respiratory openings ) follow immediate behind . There is a short but broad curtain of skin between the nostrils , with a weakly fringed rear margin . The mouth is small and gently arched , with deep furrows at the corners and a tiny projection at the center of the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw . There are anywhere from 0 to 15 forked papillae ( nipple @-@ like structures ) in a row across the floor of the mouth . There are 25 – 34 upper tooth rows and 25 – 31 lower tooth rows ; the teeth of both sexes have single , pointed cusps , but those of adult males are longer and sharper than those of adult females . The margins of the pelvic fins are nearly straight in front and become rounded at the tips and in back . 
 The whip @-@ like tail measures up to twice as long as the disc ; it is thick at the base and tapers significantly to the extremely long , serrated spine placed approximately one @-@ third to halfway along its length . Two spines may be present if a replacement grows in before the original drops off . Posterior to the spine origin , there is a low ventral fin fold that does not reach to the spine tip . Young rays are completely smooth @-@ skinned ; with age small prickles appear over the center of the back , as well as a row of small thorns along the midline from between the eyes to the origin of the spine . This species is a plain dark purple to blue @-@ green above , extending onto the tail fold , and a slightly lighter shade below . When captured and handled , it exudes a thick black mucus that covers its body . The pelagic stingray typically grows to 1 @.@ 3 m ( 4 @.@ 3 ft ) long and 59 cm ( 23 in ) across . The largest individuals on record are from a captive rearing experiment conducted from 1995 to 2000 , in which a male reached 68 cm ( 27 in ) across and 12 kg ( 26 lb ) , and a female 94 cm ( 37 in ) across and 49 kg ( 108 lb ) . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 In adopting a midwater lifestyle , the pelagic stingray exhibits several characteristics different from those of its bottom @-@ dwelling relatives . While most stingrays propel themselves by undulating their disc margins , this species swims by oscillating ( flapping ) its pectoral fins in a manner approaching the " underwater flying " employed by eagle rays . <unk> fin motions generate lift , thus improving cruising efficiency in open water at a cost to maneuverability . The pelagic stingray is adept at swimming backwards , which may compensate for the lower fine control offered by its swimming mode . 
 Vision seems to be more important to the pelagic ray in finding food than in other stingrays . Compared to other members of its family , this species has less than one @-@ third the density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside . The ampullae also cover a smaller area , though not as small as in eagle rays , and are more evenly distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces . This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV / cm at a distance of up to 30 cm ( 12 in ) , and may be able to pick up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water . The lateral line of the pelagic stingray , a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents , remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface . However , this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli . 
 Pelagic stingrays may segregate by sex , vertically in that males are found in deeper water than females , and perhaps horizontally as well . Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards ocean sunfish ( Mola mola ) , biting and harassing them , particularly if they are hungry . This species is preyed upon by oceanic whitetip sharks ( Carcharhinus longimanus ) , great white sharks ( Carcharodon carcharias ) , toothed whales , and other large , ocean @-@ going carnivores . Its all @-@ around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat . The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent , causing it to be avoided by other fishes . Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium <unk> , A. <unk> , and A. <unk> , Rhinebothrium <unk> and R. <unk> , and <unk> uarnak , and the monogenean Entobdella diadema . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The pelagic stingray is an active predator that captures prey by wrapping its pectoral fins around it , before manipulating it to the mouth . It is the only stingray in which both sexes have pointed teeth , for grasping and cutting into slippery prey . A wide variety of organisms are represented in its diet : crustaceans including amphipods , krill , and larval crabs , molluscs including squid , octopus , and pteropods , bony fishes including herring , mackerel , sea horses and filefish , comb jellies and medusae , and polychaete worms . Off California , pelagic stingrays hunt large mating aggregations of squid that form from November to April . Off Brazil , this species follows groups of Atlantic <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) towards the coast in January and February , with both predators seeking small schooling fishes . Juvenile rays consume 6 – 7 % of their body weight in food per day , which declines to just above 1 % in adults . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Like other stingrays , the pelagic stingray is aplacental viviparous : the developing embryos are at first nourished by yolk , which is later supplanted by histotroph ( " uterine milk " , containing proteins , lipids , and mucus ) ; the mother delivers the histotroph through numerous thread @-@ like extensions of the uterine epithelium called " trophonemata " , which feed into the enlarged spiracles of the embryo . Females have only one functional ovary and uterus , on the left , and may produce two litters per year . Mating occurs from March to June in the northwestern Atlantic , and in late spring in the southwestern Atlantic . Females are capable of storing sperm internally for more than a year , allowing them to wait for favorable environmental conditions in which to gestate their young . When first passed into the uterus , a batch of fertilized eggs are contained in a single membraneous capsule tapered at both ends . Shortly after , the capsule ruptures to release the eggs , and is expelled from the uterus . The gestation period may be the shortest of any shark or ray , lasting only 2 – 4 months , during which time the embryos increase a hundredfold in mass 
 In the Pacific , females give birth in winter from November to March in a nursery area near Central America , prior to their northward migration . Similarly , in the northwestern Atlantic , birthing seems to occur in winter when the females are in warm southerly waters , possibly off the West Indies . However , records also exist of two possibly anomalous females that were pregnant much earlier in the year and would given birth in August or September , before their southward migration . In the southwestern Atlantic , birthing occurs in summer around January , again in warmer water towards the equator . As opposed to other regions , in the Mediterranean females give birth in summer before moving to warmer waters . The litter size ranges from 4 to 13 ( average six ) , and does not increase with the size of the female . Newborns measure 15 – 25 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 – 9 @.@ 8 in ) across . Rays in captivity , with ample food , grow at an average annual rate of 8 @.@ 1 cm ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) ( disc width ) , while rays in the wild grow at an average annual rate of only 1 @.@ 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 63 in ) . The food intake and growth rate of adults are highest in January – February and July – August , and lowest in March – April and October – November . Males reach sexual maturity at 37 – 50 cm ( 15 – 20 in ) across and two years of age , and females at 39 – 50 cm ( 15 – 20 in ) and three years of age . This species may live up to 10 – 12 years . One of the most prolific rays , its intrinsic population growth rate is up to 31 % a year . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The pelagic stingray is not aggressive and rarely encountered because of its habitat preferences , but its very long tail spine demands extreme caution be exercised in handling it . It has been responsible for two known fatalities : a worker on a tuna <unk> who was impaled by a captured ray , and another fishery worker who succumbed to tetanus days after being stung . This species has been kept in public aquariums for almost a century . 
 The meat and cartilage of the pelagic stingray are sometimes utilized , for example in Indonesia , but for the most part this species is considered worthless and discarded when caught . Susceptible to longlines , gillnets , purse seines , and bottom trawls , it is captured incidentally in large numbers throughout its range . Rays caught on longlines suffer high mortality , as fishers are wary of being stung and remove the rays from the hooks by smashing them against the side of the boat , causing severe damage to the mouth and jaws . The extent of this bycatch has yet to be quantified . Regardless , surveys in the Pacific suggest that pelagic stingray numbers have increased since the 1950s , possibly due to commercial fisheries depleting the dominant predators in the ecosystem , such as sharks and tuna . The lack of population declines , coupled with its wide distribution and high reproductive rate , has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) to list this species under Least Concern . Recent research has been conducted into reducing pelagic stingray bycatch on longlines by switching to larger and / or " C " -shaped hooks . 
 = Russian monitor Rusalka = 
 Rusalka ( Russian : <unk> , Mermaid ) , was one of two Charodeika @-@ class monitors built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1860s . She served for her entire career with the Baltic Fleet . Aside from hitting an uncharted rock not long after she was completed in 1869 , she had an uneventful career . Rusalka sank in a storm in 1893 with the loss of all hands in the Gulf of Finland . A memorial was built in Reval ( modern Tallinn ) to commemorate her loss almost a decade later . Her wreck was rediscovered in 2003 , bow @-@ down in the mud , which has prompted a new theory regarding her loss . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Rusalka was 206 feet ( 62 @.@ 8 m ) long at the waterline . She had a beam of 42 feet ( 12 @.@ 8 m ) and a maximum draft of 12 feet 7 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . The ship was designed to displace 1 @,@ 882 long tons ( 1 @,@ 912 t ) , but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced 2 @,@ 100 long tons ( 2 @,@ 100 t ) . Her crew numbered 13 officers and 171 crewmen in 1877 . 
 The ship had two simple horizontal direct @-@ acting steam engines , each driving a single propeller . The engines were designed to produce a total of 900 indicated horsepower ( 670 kW ) using steam provided by two coal @-@ fired rectangular fire @-@ tube boilers , but only achieved 705 ihp ( 526 kW ) and a speed of approximately 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) during her sea trials . She carried a maximum of 250 long tons ( 254 t ) of coal for her boilers . 
 Rusalka was initially armed with a pair of nine @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) rifled Model 1867 guns in the forward gun turret and a pair of fifteen @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) smoothbore Rodman guns in the aft turret . The Rodman guns were replaced by a pair of Obukhov 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) rifled guns in 1871 and all of the nine @-@ inch guns were replaced in their turn by longer , more powerful nine @-@ inch Obukhov guns in 1878 – 79 . No light guns for use against torpedo boats are known to have been fitted aboard the ship before the 1870s when she received 3 four @-@ pounder 3 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 86 mm ) guns mounted on the turret tops as well as a variety of smaller guns that included 45 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) Engström quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) Nordenfelt guns , single @-@ barreled QF 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns and QF 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss revolving cannon . 
 The ship had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick amidships and thinned to 3 @.@ 75 inches ( 95 mm ) at the bow and 3 @.@ 25 inches ( 83 mm ) at the stern . The armor was backed by 12 to 18 inches ( 300 to 460 mm ) of teak . The circular turrets were protected by armor 5 @.@ 5 inches ( 140 mm ) thick and the walls of the ship 's oval conning tower were also 4 @.@ 5 inches thick . Her deck was 1 inch ( 25 mm ) thick amidships , but reduced to 0 @.@ 25 – 0 @.@ 5 inches ( 6 @.@ 4 – 12 @.@ 7 mm ) at the ends of the ship . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 Rusalka , named after the mythological creature , was ordered on 25 January 1865 and construction began on 10 June at the Admiralty Shipyard , Saint Petersburg , although the formal keel @-@ laying was not until 6 June 1866 . She was launched on 12 September 1867 and completed in 1869 at the cost of 762 @,@ 000 rubles . Construction was considerably delayed by late deliveries of drawings , material , and the death of her original builder . The ship struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast in June 1869 and damaged her bottom plating badly enough that she had to be run aground to prevent her from sinking . Rusalka served her entire career with the Baltic Fleet and was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870 . The ship had her boilers replaced in 1878 and 1891 and she was reclassified as a coast @-@ defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 . 
 = = = Sinking = = = 
 Rusalka , under the command of Captain 2nd Rank V. Kh . <unk> sailed from Reval harbor at 08 : 30 on 7 September 1893 , bound for Helsingfors ( Helsinki ) . She was escorted by the gunboat <unk> ( Russian : <unk> , Cloud ) under Captain 2nd Rank N. M. <unk> . Several hours after their departure the weather deteriorated into a storm , with gale force winds and rain ; <unk> lost her charge from sight around noon , but sailed on and arrived safely at Helsingfors . 
 No trace of the monitor was found until the corpse of a sailor in a dinghy and a few <unk> washed ashore on the Finnish island of <unk> . Extensive searches of the sea bottom also failed to locate the ship . In January 1894 a commission appointed to investigate convened and reprimanded Rear Admiral P. S. <unk> , commander of the detachment , for letting Rusalka go to sea in bad weather as well as <unk> for losing contact with the monitor . The commission concluded that the ship 's steering gear failed or that water had entered the ship and caused her to lose power . Either would have caused Rusalka to turn parallel to the waves where her superstructure would have been demolished and extensive flooding would have soon overwhelmed her small reserve of buoyancy . Whatever the cause , Rusalka obviously broached and sank with the loss of all 177 members of her crew .

 On 7 September 1902 , the ninth anniversary of the loss of the ship , a monument to Rusalka was erected in Tallinn . Sculpted by Amandus Adamson , it takes the form of a bronze angel standing on a granite pedestal .

 The wreck of Rusalka was claimed to have been found by divers of the Soviet EPRON salvage agency in 1932 , but they made no attempt to salvage it . EPRON 's location does not match that of the ship as discovered in 2003 . 
 In spring 2003 , a joint project was launched by the Estonian Maritime Museum and the commercial diving company <unk> <unk> with the aim of finding Rusalka which had sunk 110 years earlier . On 22 July 2003 the wreck of Rusalka was located in the Gulf of Finland , 25 kilometers ( 16 mi ) south of Helsinki , by the museum 's research vessel Mare . Two days later , deep divers Kaido <unk> and <unk> <unk> more precisely located and <unk> the wreck . Most unusually , the wreck is in a near @-@ vertical position ; following her sinking , the vessel plunged , bow first , 74 meters ( 243 ft ) directly downward into the muddy bottom of the gulf , and is buried in the bottom to almost half her length . The divers found the stern of the lost vessel rising 33 meters ( 108 ft ) above the sea bed and her rudder turned to starboard . 
 The wreck is generally intact although draped with snagged fishing nets . The aft turret , however , has fallen out off the ship . The vertical position of the wreck has inspired a new theory of her loss by nautical archaeologist <unk> <unk> . He believes that Rusalka was taking on water forward , perhaps from a leak or through ventilation hatches and was bow @-@ heavy when her captain decided to make a turn , possibly to return to Reval , and the ship capsized during the turn with her engines still running . Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into the muddy sea bottom . 
 = Ron " Pigpen " McKernan = 
 Ronald Charles McKernan ( September 8 , 1945 – March 8 , 1973 ) , known as Pigpen , was an American singer and musician . He was a founding member of the San Francisco band the Grateful Dead and played in the group from 1965 to 1972 . 
 McKernan grew up heavily influenced by African @-@ American music , particularly the blues , and enjoyed listening to his father 's collection of records and taught himself how to play harmonica and piano . He began socializing around the San Francisco Bay Area , becoming friends with Jerry Garcia . After the pair had played in various folk and jug bands , McKernan suggested they form an electric group , which became the Grateful Dead . He was the band 's original frontman as well as playing harmonica and electric organ , but Garcia and bassist Phil Lesh 's influences on the band became increasingly stronger as they embraced psychedelic rock . McKernan struggled to keep up , causing the group to hire keyboardist Tom Constanten , with McKernan 's contributions essentially limited to vocals , harmonica and percussion from November 1968 to January 1970 . He continued to be a frontman in concert for some numbers , including covers of Bobby Bland 's " Turn On Your Love Light " and the Rascals ' " Good Lovin ' " . 
 Unlike the other members of the Grateful Dead , McKernan avoided psychedelic drugs , preferring to drink alcohol ( namely whiskey and wine ) . By 1971 , his health had been affected by alcoholism and liver damage and doctors advised him to stop touring . Following a four @-@ month hiatus , he resumed touring with the group in December 1971 but was forced to retire from touring altogether in June 1972 . McKernan was found dead of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage on March 8 , 1973 , aged 27 and is buried at Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 Ronald Charles McKernan was born on September 8 , 1945 , in San Bruno , California . He came from Irish ancestry , and his father , Phil McKernan , was an R & B and blues disc jockey , who had been one of the first white DJs on <unk> , a black radio station . Ronald grew up with African American friends and enjoyed black music and culture . As a youth , he taught himself blues piano , guitar and harmonica and developed a biker culture image . McKernan moved to Palo Alto , California with his family , where he became friends with musician Jerry Garcia at the age of 14 . He built up a substantial collection of old blues 78s from labels such as Kent Records and Chess Records . 
 McKernan began spending time around coffeehouses and music stores , and worked at Dana Morgan 's Music Store in Palo Alto with Garcia . One night Garcia invited McKernan on stage to play harmonica and sing the blues . Garcia was impressed and McKernan became the blues singer in local jam sessions . He was initially nicknamed " Blue Ron " before settling on " Pigpen " . <unk> Adrian Room has suggested McKernan was given the name due to his untidy and unclean habits while band biographies say he got the nickname owing to his similarity to Pig @-@ Pen , the permanently dirty character in the comic @-@ strip Peanuts . 
 = = = Grateful Dead = = = 
 McKernan was a participant in the predecessor groups leading to the formation of the Grateful Dead , beginning with the Zodiacs and Mother McCree 's Uptown Jug Champions . Guitarist Bob Weir and drummer Bill Kreutzmann were added and the band evolved into the Warlocks . Around 1965 , McKernan urged the rest of the Warlocks to switch to electric instruments . Bassist Phil Lesh joined soon after , and they became the Grateful Dead . The group were keen to involve McKernan in the band , as he was the group 's original leader and was considered the best singer and frontman . 
 The Dead 's early sets centred around blues and R & B covers chosen by McKernan . By the end of 1966 , Garcia had improved his musical skills and wanted to assert himself more as a leader and musical director , changing the band 's direction and reducing McKernan 's contributions . In 1967 , drummer Mickey Hart joined the Grateful Dead , followed by classically trained keyboardist Tom Constanten in 1968 , further changing the group 's style . Constanten often replaced McKernan on keyboards in the studio , as McKernan found it difficult to adapt to the new material that Garcia and Lesh composed for the band . 
 In October 1968 , McKernan and Weir were nearly fired from the band after Garcia and Lesh believed their playing was holding the band back from lengthy and experimental jamming . Garcia delegated the task of firing them to Rock Scully , who said that McKernan " took it hard . " Weir promised to improve , but McKernan was more stubborn . According to Garcia biographer Blair Jackson , McKernan missed three Dead shows before vowing not to " be lazy " any more and rejoining , while Kreutzmann objected to replacing McKernan and said the event never happened . Following his discharge from the United States Air Force in November 1968 , Constanten officially joined the band , having only worked in the studio while on leave up to that point . Road manager Jon McIntire commented that " Pigpen was relegated to the congas at that point and it was really humiliating and he was really hurt , but he couldn 't show it , couldn 't talk about it . " He began to take Hammond organ lessons and learned how to use the various drawbars and controls . 
 After Constanten 's departure in January 1970 over musical and lifestyle differences , McKernan nominally resumed keyboard duties . He contributed instrumentation to only two tracks ( " Black Peter " and " Easy Wind , " the latter as lead vocalist ) on Workingman 's Dead ( 1970 ) , the band 's breakthrough studio release . Consequently , the group 's next studio album ( 1970 's American Beauty ) served as a showcase for session keyboardists Howard Wales and Ned <unk> , while the 1971 live album Grateful Dead featured three overdubbed organ parts from Merl Saunders in addition to McKernan 's contributions on " Big Railroad Blues " , " The Other One " , and " Me & Bobby McGee " . While Garcia expressed frustration at McKernan 's missed rehearsals and his inability to keep up with new material , Lesh was more forgiving , opining that " it was okay for Pigpen to lay out ... we kept wanting Pigpen to be there because he was ' one of us . ' " 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 While in the Grateful Dead , McKernan sang and played blues @-@ influenced organ and harmonica . He initially played a Vox Continental organ , but later switched to a Hammond . McKernan sang lead on several standards he wanted the Dead to cover , such as Otis Redding 's " Pain in My Heart " and Wilson Pickett 's " In the Midnight Hour , " with the latter serving as one of the band 's main improvisatory vehicles from 1966 to 1968 . Unlike fellow vocalists Garcia and Weir , he sang lead without playing any instrument except harmonica and actively interacted with the audience , occasionally walking out into the crowd . During the band 's first year when they played straightforward blues , McKernan performed the majority of lead vocals , attracting an early audience that came specifically to see him sing and play harmonica . He took on early management duties in the band , ensuring they would be paid and promoted properly for gigs . 
 Though McKernan 's garage rock style was appropriate for their early recordings , it was less suited to the group 's later psychedelic and jamming styles . He went from contributing to every song and singing lead on all of side two of 1968 's Anthem of the Sun to little more than sporadic appearances on the following year 's <unk> . He continued to front the band for long stretches during their live performances and suggested new material for the Dead 's concert repertoire , including Redding 's " Hard to Handle " and James Brown 's " It 's a Man 's Man 's Man 's World . " 
 McKernan achieved a new prominence in 1969 covering " Turn On Your Love Light " ; initially introduced in 1967 , the song gradually evolved into the band 's show @-@ stopping finale , often taking fifteen to thirty minutes to complete . He improvised lyrics over the band 's accompaniment , using phrases he had heard from African American friends , such as " rider " ( slang for " lover " ) , " she 's got box @-@ black <unk> " ( referring to female underwear ) and " boar hog 's eye " . When the Grateful Dead appeared at Woodstock , the band 's set ( which was marred by technical problems and general chaos and described as one of their worst shows ) ended with " Turn On Your Love Light " . Even as his instrumental contributions waned , McKernan 's vocal performances remained an integral part of the band 's live set ; by early 1971 , the band 's cover of The Rascals ' " Good Lovin ' " ( initially covered by the group in 1966 featured at shows at the Fillmore East later released as Ladies and Gentlemen ... the Grateful Dead ) began to emerge as a secondary showcase of his improvisatory talents alongside " Love Light . " 
 McKernan was not a prolific songwriter , preferring to concentrate on blues covers and improvised lyrics . He composed the infrequently performed " Operator " for 1970 's American Beauty . Several new songs emerged from a creatively fecund period coinciding with his health problems in 1971 , most notably " Mr. Charlie , " a collaboration with Dead lyricist Robert Hunter . The song appeared on the live album Europe ' 72 , his last with the group . 
 Tony Sclafani has compared McKernan 's role in the band , initially strong and pivotal but gradually declining , to that of Brian Jones in the Rolling Stones , particularly since both men were primarily influenced by the blues over rock ' n ' roll and died aged 27 . These comparisons are not entirely accurate as McKernan was always encouraged to sing material live and left the group due to ill health , while Jones was fired . 
 After McKernan 's death , a number of recordings were found in his apartment , which have appeared as the bootleg recording " The Apartment Tapes " . This included two songs recorded in 1964 with future Jefferson Airplane guitarist Jorma Kaukonen . On the bootleg , McKernan played acoustic guitar and piano , instruments he seldom used with the Dead . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 McKernan was close friends with American singer @-@ songwriter Janis Joplin due to common musical influences and lifestyles , particularly a shared love of alcohol over other drugs ; a poster from the early 1970s showed them together at 710 Ashbury . Joplin joined McKernan on stage at the Fillmore West on June 7 , 1969 , with the Grateful Dead to sing his signature " Turn On Your Love Light , " reprising this duet on July 16 , 1970 , at the Euphoria Ballroom in San Rafael , California . 
 McKernan was good friends with fellow band member Tom Constanten , based on their mutual aversion to psychedelics . He eventually served as best man at Constanten 's wedding . While his bandmates and friends were using cannabis , LSD , and other hallucinogenic drugs , McKernan preferred alcoholic beverages such as Thunderbird and Southern Comfort . Ironically , McKernan was arrested and fined after the cannabis bust on November 9 , 1967 , at 710 Ashbury Street , the Dead 's communal home , even though he did not use the drug . The event was covered in the first issue of Rolling Stone , where the reporter noted McKernan had a substantial rifle collection and McKernan 's picture appeared on a contemporary report in the San Francisco Chronicle . Because neither took illegal drugs , McKernan and Constanten were the only members of the band not arrested on the January 31 , 1970 , bust that inspired the lyrics of the band 's song " Truckin ' " . 
 In the early years of the Grateful Dead , McKernan was easily recognisable by his biker image , making him a minor celebrity . In 1969 , the band 's record company , Warner Bros. Records ran a " Pigpen Look @-@ Alike Contest " . 
 = = Health and death = = 
 McKernan 's alcohol abuse had begun to affect his health by his mid twenties . By the early 1970s , he also began to experience symptoms of congenital biliary cirrhosis , a rare autoimmune disease which was unrelated to his use of alcohol . After being hospitalized in August 1971 , doctors requested that he stop touring indefinitely . Pianist Keith Godchaux was subsequently hired and remained a regular member of the Grateful Dead until 1979 . McKernan rejoined the band in December 1971 to supplement Godchaux on harmonica , percussion , and organ . Manager Rock Scully alleged that McKernan passed out in front of his Hammond organ at one show during this period . After their Europe ' 72 tour , his health had deteriorated to the point where he could no longer continue playing live . He made his final concert appearance on June 17 , 1972 , at the Hollywood Bowl , in Los Angeles , California . He subsequently broke off all personal relationships with the band , explaining " I don 't want you around when I die . " 
 On March 8 , 1973 , aged 27 he was found dead of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage at his home in Corte Madera , California by his landlady . Though his contributions to the band had slowly diminished over the years , the other members were devastated at his death . McKernan was buried at the Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto , California . Garcia spoke at his funeral , saying " After Pigpen 's death we all knew this was the end of the original Grateful Dead " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Despite his outward image , friends and band biographers have described McKernan as a quiet , kind and introspective person . Hart later said " Pigpen was the musician in the Grateful Dead . " Kreutzmann said McKernan was " the sweetest guy anybody had ever met . " 
 Weir later became influenced by McKernan 's ability to work a crowd and improvise lyrics . He took over de facto frontman duties in concert and began to reintroduce material originally chosen by McKernan into the Dead 's live set after his death . Weir began singing " Good Lovin ' " with the Dead in 1973 , and the group recorded the song on 1978 's Shakedown Street . " Turn On Your Love Light " was revived in 1981 , with Weir singing lead . He also revived the 1960s standard " Big Boy Pete " , originally sung by McKernan , as a one @-@ off in 1985 . Jimmy Reed 's " Big Boss Man " , covered by the group on Grateful Dead ( Skull and Roses ) with McKernan singing lead , was revived by Garcia and performed occasionally through the 1980s and 90s . 
 " He 's Gone " , originally appearing on the live album Europe ' 72 subsequently became a eulogy to McKernan by his former bandmates . Hunter said " it became an anthem for Pigpen " .

 = Everard Calthrop = 
 Everard Richard Calthrop ( 3 March 1857 – 30 March 1927 ) was a British railway engineer and inventor . Calthrop was a notable promoter and builder of narrow gauge railways , especially of 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) narrow gauge , and was especially prominent in India . His most notable achievement was the Barsi Light Railway ; however he is best known in his home country for the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway . Calthrop has been described as a " railway genius " . Later in life he took an interest in aviation , patenting some early designs for parachutes . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Calthrop was born on 3 March 1857 , the eldest son of farmer Everard Calthrop . He had six brothers , one of whom was Sir Guy Calthrop , general manager of the London & North Western Railway . The family lived at Deeping Fen , Lincolnshire , where Calthrop was born , and later at Sutton in the Isle of Ely . Calthrop was educated at Uppingham School . 
 Calthrop started work with Robert Stephenson & Co and then was apprenticed to the London & North Western Railway at Crewe in 1874 . In 1879 he joined the Great Western Railway , where he rose to assistant manager of the Carriage and Wagon Works . In 1882 he went to India to join the Great Indian Peninsula Railway as a locomotive inspector . 
 Once in India , Calthrop came to see narrow gauge railways as a way to help develop the country . This led him to chairing a Government committee to investigate light railways throughout India . He then published a pamphlet entitled A System of Standard Details as applied to the Construction of Rolling Stock in India . As a result of this pamphlet , the Indian Government adopted systems of uniformity of gauge and equipment throughout the country , and eventually adopted 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) gauge as the standard narrow gauge throughout the country . 
 Calthrop requested leave in 1886 to investigate proposals for independent <unk> . He identified two schemes of particular interest , a 5 @-@ mile ( 8 km ) tramway connecting the Hindu religious centre of Nasik with the railway , and a 21 @-@ mile ( 34 km ) <unk> to the town of Barsi . The Great Indian Peninsula Railway approved both schemes , and Calthrop undertook a survey of both lines . In 1887 he registered the Indian Railways Feeder Lines Company in London to promote the construction of feeders to the railway . The Great Indian Peninsula Railway suggested that he either return to his duties as a locomotive inspector , or , with their support , resign to further promote branch lines . His health was failing , and so in 1889 Calthrop resigned from the Great Indian Peninsula Railway . Working as a consultant he then supervised the construction of the 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) gauge horse @-@ powered Nasik Tramway , using his previous survey . 
 = = Move to Liverpool = = 
 Returning to the United Kingdom in 1892 Calthrop established a railway engineering consulting practice in Liverpool , where three of his brothers had started a <unk> company . Soon Calthrop had entered into a partnership with them and spent much of the next two years designing equipment for feed production . He took out a number of patents relating to the equipment and to refrigerated transport . 
 While Calthrop was resident in Liverpool the Chamber of Commerce was concerned future expansion was being limited by the railway companies that linked that city with Manchester , and invited proposals for alternative methods for moving goods . Calthrop proposed a system of narrow gauge railways linking the two cities , running along streets directly serving factories . His proposal was highly commended , but the proposed street running precluded its adoption . 
 Calthrop was also interested in road transport . He was a member of the Self @-@ Propelled Traffic Association and in May 1898 was a judge at their trials for " motor vehicles for heavy traffic " , held in Liverpool . The winner was a Thornycroft 4 @-@ ton steam wagon . Later he was a foundation member of the Royal Automobile Club . 
 = = Development of narrow gauge concepts and the Barsi Light Railway = = 
 During his time in India Calthrop developed his ideas on the construction of narrow gauge railways . He surmised that the axle load on the axles of all rolling stock , including locomotives , could be equal , allowing a maximum loading of goods wagons . He settled on a loading of 5 long tons ( 5 @.@ 1 t ; 5 @.@ 6 short tons ) per axle , which was light enough to allow railway lines to be built with 30 pounds per yard ( 14 @.@ 9 kilograms per metre ) rail . It also allowed the loading of one 20 long tons ( 20 @.@ 3 t ; 22 @.@ 4 short tons ) capacity 4 @-@ wheel standard gauge wagon to be carried on a single bogie narrow gauge wagon . Further , he argued that using a track gauge of 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) gave the greatest capacity as a percentage of capital cost . He estimated a 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) gauge railway could be built to four times the length of a standard gauge railway for the same capital cost . 
 Calthrop had been engaged in negotiations with the Indian government for concessions to build a railway from Barsi Road to Barsi since 1887 . In 1895 negotiations reached a satisfactory conclusion , and Calthrop formed a new company to build the Barsi Light Railway , and employed himself as consulting engineer . The railway became a showcase for his ideas . Five 0 @-@ 8 @-@ 4T locomotives , with even distribution of axle load , were constructed to Calthrop 's specification by Kitson & Co . The goods rolling stock was constructed on common 25 by 7 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m × 2 @.@ 1 m ) pressed steel underframes , reducing tare weight and maximising potential wagon loads . Calthrop recognised the importance of railways in warfare , and designed the rolling stock to facilitate the movement of troops and equipment . Rolling stock rode on pressed @-@ steel Fox bogies , using the Timmis system of double coiled springs . The line was constructed with rail inclination , then a new idea , which involves tilting the rail a few degrees to make its surface more nearly parallel with that of the tyre . Inclination is now applied universally to railways . The rolling stock could accept 100 @-@ foot ( 30 @.@ 48 m ) radius curves . 
 Prior to shipment of the rolling stock to India , Calthrop and the Leeds Forge Company , manufacturer of the rolling stock , conducted tests on a specially built test track located at <unk> , near Leeds . The line was opened for inspection by railway officials and journalists , and a number of reports were published in the technical railway press . 
 The Barsi Light Railway opened in 1897 , and was extended on a number of occasions until it reached a total length of 202 miles ( 325 km ) in 1927 . The example of the Barsi Light Railway is regarded as having revolutionised the narrow gauge railway system of Indian subcontinent , and the railway was immensely successful , establishing Calthrop as one of the leading figures in the field . Calthrop remained Consulting Engineer until he retired due to ill health two years prior to his death . The Barsi Light Railway continued to be operated as a privately owned railway until 1954 when it was purchased by the Indian government , and continued to operate as a narrow gauge railway until conversion to broad gauge began in the late 1990s as part of Indian Railways conversion program for all metre and narrow gauge lines .

 The Barbados Railway opened in 1883 as a 3 ft 6 in ( 1 @,@ 067 mm ) gauge railway from Bridgetown to St Andrew , Barbados . By 1897 the railway and its rolling stock was in very poor condition . Further much of the railway had been constructed with rail too light for the railway 's locomotives . A new company was established in 1898 to rebuild and operate the railway , and Calthrop was engaged as consulting engineer . Calthrop arranged for the railway to be rebuilt in 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) gauge , and had Baldwin Locomotive Works build four new locomotives , two 2 @-@ 8 @-@ 2T 's , an 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0T and an 0 @-@ 6 @-@ 0T .

 Calthrop appeared at the Light Railway Inquiry for the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway on 3 – 4 August 1897 and spoke particularly on the proposed open level crossings and the use of transporter wagons . Calthrop claimed it only took 3 minutes to transfer wagons , based on his experience on the Barsi Light Railway . However the Order was not made until 8 September 1899 and in early 1900 the proprietors reached agreement with the Cambrian Railways to build the line . Their engineer , Alfred J. Collins , took charge of the engineering requirements , with consequent conservative 4 @-@ wheel wagons and other provisions .

 In 1898 Calthrop corresponded with the government of the colony of Victoria , Australia , regarding proposals for the construction of narrow gauge lines in that colony . Subsequently on his advice the gauge of the railways as built was changed from 2 ft ( 610 mm ) to 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) .

 Calthrop was appointed to advise on engineering matters for this 750 mm ( 2 ft 5 1 ⁄ 2 in ) gauge Egyptian light railway , construction of which began in 1898 . The railway comprised seven , mostly roadside , branch lines with a total length of 97 miles ( 156 km ) . The <unk> Light Railway served an irrigation district south of Cairo , centred on the provincial capital of Medinet @-@ el @-@ Fayum . Calthrop used pictures of rolling stock from the railway to illustrate a chapter he wrote for the book Pioneer Irrigation and Light Railways .

 The Cleobury Mortimer and Ditton Priors Light Railway was a 12 @.@ 3 @-@ mile ( 19 @.@ 8 km ) long standard gauge branch line linking the Great Western Railway at Cleobury Mortimer in Shropshire with mineral deposits in the Clee Hills . Calthrop was appointed Consulting Engineer in 1900 , responsible for surveying the route and preparing the construction plans . 
 = = = Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway = = = 
 In the United Kingdom Calthrop is most associated with the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway . The line had been promoted under the Light Railways Act , and the initial plan was to build a railway of 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) gauge to be powered by electricity . Under the influence of one of the Light Railway Commissioners the company directors commissioned a report on the proposed line from Calthrop in mid @-@ 1900 . In early December the railway 's engineer died , and on 19 December 1900 the Directors sat down to consider both a replacement and Calthrop 's report . Calthrop proposed specifications for the line which would result in substantial savings in construction costs , and so he was offered the position of engineer , which he promptly accepted . 
 Calthrop constructed the line for £ 35 @,@ 944 , £ 11 @,@ 000 less than the original estimate . He had Kitson & Co construct two 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 4T locomotives , similar in outline but smaller than the Barsi Light Railway locomotives . Goods rolling stock included four coaches , two bogie open wagons and one bogie van , once again similar to Barsi stock . He also introduced four transporter wagons , designed to transport standard gauge wagons . Each station on route had a short section of standard gauge track where the wagons could be placed . The use of transporter wagons eliminated transshipment , and removed the need for large numbers of goods wagons . 
 = = = Matheran Light Railway = = = 
 The Matheran Light Railway is a mountain railway near Mumbai , India , and opened in 1905 . Unusually for a railway for which <unk> was consulting engineer , it was of 2 ft ( 610 mm ) gauge , with tight curves and 1 in 20 ( 5 % ) grades . Calthrop designed a 0 @-@ 6 @-@ 0T with Klein @-@ Linder articulated coupled axles to provide a flexible wheelbase , and four were supplied by Orenstein & Koppel . Calthrop 's firm also supplied the wagon stock and the points and crossings for the railway .

 In 1910 Calthrop was engaged as consulting engineer by the promoters of a new railway between <unk> and <unk> in Burma , later known as the Arakan Light Railway . Calthrop had the proposed gauge changed from 2 ft ( 610 mm ) narrow gauge to 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) narrow gauge . For this railway Calthrop had built two 0 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 + 0 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 Garratt locomotives , to which he had attached plates reading " <unk> 's System of Narrow Gauge Mountain Railways " . Calthrop was an early adopter of the Garratt type , this being the ninth order for <unk> taken by Beyer @-@ Peacock , and the smallest Garratt design ever built by them . 
 = = Patents for parachutes = = 
 Calthrop was a close personal friend of Charles Rolls , of Rolls @-@ Royce fame . Rolls was a pioneer aviator , being the first man to fly across the English Channel in both directions . On 12 July 1910 Calthrop accompanied him to the Bournemouth International Aviation Meeting , and was present when Rolls died after he lost control of his biplane and crashed . That and a similar , non @-@ fatal , accident involving his son Tev , led Calthrop to believe that a parachute could be used to save pilots in similar circumstances . 
 In 1913 he patented his first parachute . As World War I progressed he continued to develop his parachute . In 1915 he offered it to the Royal Flying Corps , and successful tests were completed at the time . An unofficial report offered the opinion that parachutes " might impair the fighting spirit of pilots " and the offer was rejected . Calthrop was encouraged to remain quiet about his invention , but faced with increasing losses of pilots he publicised the parachute in 1917 . Despite a campaign by some pilots , the Royal Flying Corps declined to introduce parachutes during World War One , although air forces of most other nations did so . 
 <unk> " Guardian Angel " parachute received much praise and was used during the war to drop agents behind enemy lines . In October 1918 an article on use of parachutes stated that the " Guardian Angel " was one of the best known and that " balloonists can take their perilous leap , when attacked by a Hun scout , with real confidence in a safe landing " . By 1918 it was known that the Germans were fully aware of Calthrop 's work , and supplied their pilots with a similar design . However when the Royal Air Force finally adopted parachutes after the war , they chose an American design . 
 In 1916 Calthrop also patented an ejector seat for aircraft using compressed air . 
 = = Private life = = 
 During his time in India , Calthrop made occasional trips back to Britain . On one such trip he married Isabel Mary Earle , the daughter of the Reverend Walter Earle , a friend of his parents . The wedding took place on 19 November 1890 at the Bilton Parish Church , Rugby . They had four children , Everard Earle ( Tev , b . 1892 ) , Keith de Suffield ( b . 1894 ) , Isabelle Iris ( b . 1895 ) , and Betty Marion ( b . 1899 ) . Tev joined the army and became a Colonel in the Royal Engineers , while Keith , after a stint in the Royal Engineers went on to become Assistant General Manager and Mechanical Engineer of the Barsi Light Railway , a post he held until 1932 . 
 Calthrop had a great interest in breeding Arabian horses . Following the long @-@ term rental of a villa in Goldings Road , Loughton , Essex , he purchased a permanent home , Goldings , at Clays Lane in Loughton , with stables and 40 acres ( 160 @,@ 000 m2 ) of grounds . It was here that he bred his horses and developed his theories of horse training . Calthrop rejected the cruel methods of breaking horses common in that era , and practiced gentle methods . Such was his concern for his horses that he had them humanely destroyed rather than have them commandeered by the British army at the start of the First World War . After the war he was able to return to his horses , and wrote an authoritative book , The Horse , as Comrade and Friend , published in 1920 . Calthrop was a prominent member of the Arab Horse Society , and received commendations for his stallion , Fitz , at its first show in 1919 . 
 Developing and promoting his parachute had left Calthrop drained , both financially and physically . Failing health forced him to resign his position as consulting engineer for the Barsi Railway in 1925 , although he remained a director . Calthrop died at his Paddington , London , home on 30 March 1927 , in the company of his son , Tev . He was seventy years old . 
 Calthrop is commemorated by a blue plaque on Goldings , unveiled in June 2008 .

 " Winter Is Coming " is the first episode of the HBO medieval fantasy television series Game of Thrones . It was written by the show creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss , in a faithful adaptation of the first chapters of George R. R. Martin 's book A Game of Thrones . The episode was directed by Tim Van Patten , redoing the work done by director Thomas McCarthy in an unaired pilot . 
 As the first episode of the series , it introduces the setting and the main characters of the show . The episode centers on the Stark family , and how its lord , Eddard Stark , gets involved in the court politics after the king chooses Eddard to replace his recently deceased chief administrator ( " Hand of the King " ) . The episode received largely positive reviews , and was seen initially by 2 @.@ 2 million viewers . A week before the episode first aired , HBO made the first 15 minutes available as an Internet preview . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode begins the process of interweaving action happening in multiple separate locations within and around the fictional continent of Westeros . Most of the action takes place in and around Winterfell where Lord Eddard Stark ( Sean Bean ) is the feudal overlord of the northern reaches of the kingdom . Outside of Westeros is a land across the Narrow Sea where the two surviving members of House Targaryen , previous rulers of Westeros , live in exile . 
 = = = Beyond the Wall = = = 
 The episode opens with three rangers of the Night 's Watch - Ser <unk> Royce ( Rob <unk> ) , Will ( Bronson Webb ) and Gared ( Dermot Keaney ) - scouting beyond the Wall , a massive barrier of ice at the north end of the kingdom . After finding the mutilated corpses of some wildlings ( tribal humans who live north of the Wall ) , the rangers are confronted by White Walkers ( demonic creatures ) and undead wildlings . Two of the rangers are killed by the White Walkers , while the third , Will , is for some reason left alive . Fearing for his life , Will deserts the Night 's Watch . 
 = = = In King 's Landing = = = 
 Queen Cersei ( Lena Headey ) , and her twin brother , Jaime Lannister ( Nikolaj Coster @-@ Waldau ) , are watching as the dead body of Jon Arryn , The Hand of The King ( John Standing ) is tended to by the Silent Sisters . They discuss whether he revealed any dangerous information regarding the two of them to anyone before his death . Jaime assures his sister that if Arryn had spoken to anyone , they would already have been executed . 
 = = = In the North = = = 
 After the opening sequence , the Starks of Winterfell are introduced , including Lord Eddard " Ned " Stark , his wife , Lady Catelyn " Cat " Stark ( Michelle Fairley ) and his five children : their heir Robb ( Richard Madden ) , their elder daughter Sansa ( Sophie Turner ) , younger daughter Arya ( Maisie Williams ) , ten @-@ year @-@ old son Bran ( Isaac Hempstead @-@ Wright ) and youngest son , <unk> ( Art Parkinson ) . Also introduced are Ned 's illegitimate son Jon Snow ( Kit Harington ) and hostage / ward Theon Greyjoy ( Alfie Allen ) , who , like Robb , are older teenagers . 
 Ned is informed that a deserter of the Night 's Watch , Will , has been captured . Members of the Night 's Watch are sworn never to desert their posts , upon penalty of death . Ned takes his sons to witness Will 's execution . Will faces death bravely , admitting that he deserted the Wall after being attacked , but stands by his statement that he saw White Walkers . Ned himself passes sentence and beheads him . When Bran asks his father about the ranger 's talk of White Walkers , Ned dismisses it as a madman 's ravings , insisting that the Walkers have been considered extinct for thousands of years . 
 Upon their return , the Starks find a dead stag , sigil ( seal ) of House Baratheon . A bit farther they find a dead dire wolf and her surviving pups . Noting that the dire wolf is the sigil of the Stark family and there are as many pups as the Stark children ( even an albino runt for Jon ) , they take the pups in as companions . 
 Back at Winterfell , Catelyn informs her husband of a letter announcing the death of Lord Arryn , Eddard 's old mentor and Catelyn 's brother @-@ in @-@ law . An additional message , brought by a raven , reports that the king himself is coming to Winterfell . Winterfell receives the royal court , including King Robert Baratheon ( Mark Addy ) ; his wife Queen Cersei ; their three children : the heir Prince Joffrey ( Jack Gleeson ) , Princess <unk> ( Aimee Richardson ) and the youngest Prince <unk> ( Callum <unk> ) ; as well as Cersei 's twin brother , Jaime Lannister , a member of the Kingsguard ; and their younger brother , Tyrion Lannister ( Peter Dinklage ) , a dwarf known as " The Imp . " As Robert pays his respects to <unk> Stark , his late fiancée and Ned 's sister , Robert confides to his old friend that he doesn 't trust anyone around him . He decides to name Ned as the new Hand of the King , and to solidify the alliance between the two families , he suggests that Ned 's daughter , Sansa , be betrothed to his son , Joffrey . 
 At night , Catelyn receives a troubling message from her sister , Lord Arryn 's widow . She suspects her husband Jon was murdered by the king 's in @-@ laws , the powerful Lannisters . Ned , who at first was reluctant to accept the position of Hand of the King , does so in order to protect his old friend . Bran , who enjoys climbing the walls of Winterfell , climbs an abandoned tower where he stumbles on Queen Cersei and Jaime having sex . To keep the incestuous relationship a secret , Jaime shoves Bran out of the high window .

 Exiled prince Viserys Targaryen ( Harry Lloyd ) plots to overthrow King Robert and reclaim his father 's throne . To this end , he brokers a marriage between his sister Daenerys ( Emilia Clarke ) and a powerful warlord Khal Drogo ( Jason Momoa ) , leader of a nomadic horde of Dothraki . 
 Daenerys voices her fear of the barbarian lord , but her brother tells her to marry him . During the wedding ceremony , Daenerys is given two wedding gifts . The first is a collection of books from the Seven Kingdoms , given by Ser Jorah Mormont ( Iain Glen ) , an exiled knight loyal to the Targaryens . The second gift is a chest containing three petrified dragon eggs , given by Magister Illyrio <unk> ( Roger Allam ) , the man who helped arrange the marriage .

 A number of Hollywood studios had contacted George R.R. Martin about possible adaption of his book series A Song of Ice and Fire into a film , however Martin expressed the opinion the books could not be made into a film as too much would have to be cut from the books , but thought it could be made into a television series . In January 2006 , David Benioff spoke to Martin 's literary agent about the books he represented for possible adaption , and the agent sent the first four books of A Song of Fire and Ice to David Benioff . Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first book in the series , A Game of Thrones , called D. B. Weiss and said : " Maybe I ’ m crazy , but I haven ’ t had this much fun reading anything in about 20 years . So take a look because I think it might make a great HBO series . " Weiss , who then read the first book in two days , was very enthusiastic about a possible television project based on the books . They arranged a meeting with George RR Martin , who asked them if they knew who Jon Snow ’ s real mother might be , and was satisfied with their answer . 
 In March 2006 , a few weeks after meeting Martin , Benioff and Weiss pitched the show to Showtime and Carolyn Strauss of HBO , who accepted their proposal . HBO acquired the rights to the novels to turn them into a television series , with Benioff and Weiss as writers and executive producers of the series . The series went into development in January 2007 . The series would begin with the 1996 first book of A Song of Fire and Ice , " A Game of Thrones " , with the intention that each novel in the series would form the basis for a season 's worth of episodes . However , Benioff and Weiss had to resubmit a proposal after Carolyn Strauss stepped down as president of HBO in 2008 . The first and second drafts of the pilot script , written by Benioff and Weiss , were submitted in August 2007 and June 2008 respectively . While HBO found both drafts to their liking , a pilot was not ordered until November 2008 . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Scripted by the show creators David Benioff and D. B.

Changes in the adaptation include the sequence of events in the prologue ( in the books it is Gared and not Will who survives and is beheaded by Eddard afterwards ) , new scenes showing the Lannister twins ' perspective , and Daenerys ' wedding night showing Drogo not waiting for her to consent to sex . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Tom McCarthy was chosen to direct the pilot episode , shot between 24 October and 19 November 2009 on location in Northern Ireland , Scotland and Morocco . However , the pilot was deemed unsatisfactory and had to be reshot . 
 The new pilot episode was filmed in 2010 by new director Tim Van Patten , and several actors appearing in the original pilot did not return for the series . <unk> Merchant was replaced as Daenerys Targaryen by Emilia Clarke , and Jennifer Ehle was replaced as Catelyn Stark by Michelle Fairley . Additionally , Ian McNeice was replaced as Magister Illyrio by Roger Allam , Richard Ridings as Gared by Dermot Keaney , and Jamie Campbell Bower as Ser <unk> Royce by Rob <unk> . 
 Another difference is that the original pilot featured scenes shot in Scotland and scenes in Pentos were shot in Morocco , but in the aired series , Winterfell was filmed in a combination of locations in Northern Ireland , while scenes from Pentos were from Malta . The Doune Castle in Scotland was originally used to recreate Winterfell , and its great hall was used for some interior shots . Some scenes survived , but as it was not practical to return to Scotland for the reshoot , an exact replica of Doune 's Great Hall was recreated in the soundstage in Belfast for the series . Castle Ward in Northern Ireland was used in the reshoot to film King Robert 's entourage entry into Winterfell castle . A car park stood in for the Winterfell castle 's courtyard and a wine cellar for the Stark family crypt . The <unk> Forest Park was used for the opening scene of the encounter with the White Walkers . 
 All the scenes shot in Morocco were reshot in Malta . The original pilot reused the sets of Kingdom of Heaven in Morocco to stand in for Pentos and the site of Drogo and Daenerys ' wedding . In Malta , the Verdala Palace , the 16th century summer palace of the president of Malta , was used for the exterior scenes at Illyrio 's mansion . The Azure Window was used as the backdrop for the wedding . Filming at the Azure Window however caused some controversy when a protected ecosystem was damaged by a subcontractor . 
 In the sex scene , the then @-@ pregnant Lena Headey was substituted by a body double ; the production hid her pregnancy for the rest of the season . In the scene in which the Starks encounter a stag killed by a dire wolf as they return from the execution , an actual animal was used rather than a prop . As the stag had been dead for two days , it stank so much that the actors had to take much care not to let it show on their faces . Some scenes filmed were never aired , for the example a flashback to the death of Eddard Stark 's brother , and the death of Jon Arryn . 
 = = = The original pilot = = = 
 The original pilot from 2009 was poorly received in a private viewing with friends , one of whom , Craig Mazin , said to Benioff and Weiss , " You guys have a massive problem " , and said " change everything " when asked for ideas . Weiss said of the viewing : " Watching them watch the pilot was a deeply humiliating , painful experience , because these are very smart individuals , and it just clearly wasn ’ t working for any of them on a very basic level . " For example , it was never established that the two major characters , Jaime and Cersei Lannister were in fact brother and sister , a major plot point . 
 HBO did not make a decision for four months after the pilot was delivered . In March 2010 , HBO 's decision to greenlight the series including the pilot was announced , with the production of the series scheduled to start June 2010 . HBO however demanded extensive reshoot of the pilot , and wanted all the scenes from Morocco scrapped . A cameo appearance by George RR Martin as a <unk> nobleman at Daenerys ' wedding filmed in Morocco was therefore also cut . In all 90 percent of the pilot was re @-@ shot in 2010 , with some cast changes and a different director . 
 = = = Aired episode = = = 
 The original pilot remained unaired , although some footage from the original pilot was used in the first aired episode . This includes Sansa 's scenes with Catelyn ( Michelle Fairley 's footage as Catelyn was inserted over Jennifer Ehle 's performance ) , Will 's ride through the woods ( retained though also portrayed by a different actor ) , most of the feast at Winterfell , and Ned and Robert 's scene in the crypt . That scene is one of a few to be filmed on 35 mm film , and consequently slight film grain can be seen in the HD version of the episode .

 The critical response to the first episode of the series was positive . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 10 reviews of the episode and judged 100 % of them to be positive . The website 's critical consensus reads , " ' Winter is Coming ' is an introduction to a wonderfully bleak journey that honors its source material with stellar execution and an impressive cast . " James Poniewozik from Time considered it an " epic win , " and Jace Lacob from The Daily Beast deemed it " unforgettable . " HitFix 's Alan Sepinwall wrote that while it was too early to say if Game of Thrones belonged to the HBO pantheon with shows like The Sopranos or The Wire , it had many things in common with those shows . IGN 's Matt Fowler wrote that the pilot " effortlessly takes us along , faithfully , through the book , but it also manages to capture the majestically morbid spirit of Martin 's pages and turn them into thrilling television . " 
 Much praise was given to the production values and the acting : Scott Meslow from The Atlantic states that " the show 's immense cast is almost universally strong , and the fantasy land of Westeros feels lived @-@ in , and looks terrific . " Alan Sepinwall also qualifies the casting as " really exceptional , " and states that the show is " feast for the eyes , " with all the different locations having their own memorable looks . The opening sequence , with an aerial view of the world where the series takes place with the different settings emerging from it , was also acclaimed . 
 On April 19 , less than two days after the initial airing , HBO announced that the series had been renewed for a second season . In a press teleconference , HBO executives announced their satisfaction with initial ratings , which they compared favorably to True Blood .

 Clarence Edgar ( Mick ) Harvey , ( born 17 March 1921 at Newcastle , New South Wales ) , is a former first @-@ class cricketer and Australian Test cricket umpire . He was the brother of Test batsmen Merv and Neil Harvey . 
 Harvey made his first @-@ class debut in 1948 – 49 , playing in the first three matches of the season for Victoria as an opening batsman . However , he was unproductive , scoring only 91 runs at a batting average of 15 @.@ 16 , and was dropped . He moved to Queensland the following season in search of more opportunities and was selected in one match . 
 Harvey had his best first @-@ class season in 1950 – 51 , scoring 490 runs at 37 @.@ 69 , including his maiden first @-@ class century against a full @-@ strength New South Wales team with several Test bowlers . However , he struggled the following season and was dropped , and did not play a single first @-@ class match in 1952 – 53 . Recalled the following season , he overcame a slow start to score two centuries later in the summer to end with 421 runs at 38 @.@ 27 for the summer . After a poor season , Harvey was dropped late in the 1955 – 56 season . 
 Harvey was dropped after two matches in 1956 – 57 , ending his first @-@ class career . After his playing career was over , Harvey took up umpiring , and made his first @-@ class debut in 1974 – 75 . He became a regular official over the next few seasons and then broke into international umpiring in 1978 – 79 . In that summer , Harvey stood in two One Day Internationals ( ODIs ) and one Test . The following season he made his final appearances at international level , presiding over another Test and four ODIs . His last season of top @-@ level domestic umpiring was in 1981 – 82 during which he officiated in two matches . He finished his career having presided over 31 first @-@ class and 13 List A matches . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Mick 's father Horace " Horry " Harvey moved to Broken Hill , New South Wales where he worked for BHP driving horse @-@ drawn trailers . In 1914 , he married Elsie May Bitmead and their first two children , daughter Rita and son Merv , were born in the mining town . The family relocated to Newcastle , a mining town and harbour in New South Wales , where Clarence Edgar Harvey — always known as Mick , as he was born on Saint Patrick ’ s Day — and Harold were born . In 1926 , the Harveys shifted to the inner @-@ Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy , a staunchly working @-@ class , industrial area . During their relocation , Ray was born in Sydney . Horace secured a job at the confectionery company Life Savers ( Australasia ) Ltd , located next door to their house at 198 Argyle Street . The 19th century two @-@ storey house was owned by the firm and was used as lodgings for the workers ’ families . It no longer exists , having been demolished to make way for a textile factory . The two youngest sons Neil and Brian were born in Fitzroy . The Cornish @-@ descended Horry raised his family as strict Methodists , disallowing gambling , alcohol , tobacco and profanity in his household . An ardent cricketer , he encouraged his children to play sport . He himself played for the Rita Social Club after moving to Fitzroy . 
 As recreational facilities and grass ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy , the boys took to playing cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their terraced house . Here they played cricket with a tennis ball , home made cricket bat and a kerosene tin for a wicket . They were usually joined by other local children , two of whom became elite sportsmen : Allan Ruthven ( an Australian rules footballer ) and Harold Shillinglaw ( both an Australian rules footballer and first @-@ class cricketer ) — the group also played Australian rules football , kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper . Much of the batting skill displayed by the Harvey brothers has been attributed to these games played on the unpredictable bounce of the bumpy laneway . The surface also had a V @-@ shaped slope inwards towards the centre of the lane , causing balls to deviate sideways after bouncing . As the laneway meant that the playing area was long and narrow , the young boys also had to learn to play the ball straight in accordance with orthodox cricket technique . The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard using a marble instead of a ball that sharpened their reflexes , and a miniature bat . All were right @-@ handed batsmen with the exception of Neil . 
 All of the children attended the nearby George Street State School and , one by one , the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens . The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year . The successful student would then be given access to all of the club 's facilities . All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal . At Fitzroy , they came under the influence of former Victorian all @-@ rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club ’ s veteran captain Joe Plant . The Harveys had no formal coaching , and their father , although a regular presence at the club , chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed . Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat , allowing them to formulate their own style and technique . According to the Harvey brothers , it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted , in contrast to their reserved father . The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty , and according to them , their parents never showed favouritism . 
 During the winter , they played baseball for Fitzroy , often competing in matches played as curtain raisers to the elite Australian rules football competition , the Victorian Football League . Saturday night entertainment for the family typically consisted of dinner after the day ’ s cricket matches for Fitzroy , and Plant , Liddicut and other cricket club personnel were often invited . Under the influence of Plant and Liddicut , the boys were taught to adopt an aggressive approach , using fast feet movement to attack spin bowling in particular . 
 = = World War II and first @-@ class debut = = 
 A printer by trade , Harvey first played in the Fitzroy First XI in 1938 – 39 . Mick opened the batting with Merv , and in 1942 – 43 , when Neil broke into the First XI , the family occupied the first four batting positions for the team ; Merv and Mick opened and Ray and Neil came in after them . During World War II , Harvey enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force at Fitzroy on 4 March 1943 and was a member of the 39th Infantry Battalion and went on to serve in Kokoda . He was discharged on 29 March 1946 with the rank of private . He resumed cricket with Fitzroy at the war ’ s end and made enough runs to be selected for Victoria ’ s first three Sheffield Shield matches of the 1948 – 49 season . Playing as an opening batsman , he made 10 and 13 on debut against Queensland , and was trapped leg before wicket ( lbw ) in both innings in an eight @-@ wicket win . In the next match against New South Wales , who boasted Australia ’ s new ball opening bowlers Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller , Harvey made 19 and 33 in a drawn match . In the subsequent match against South Australia , he made 4 and 12 , again being trapped lbw in both innings . The 1948 – 49 season was purely domestic with no touring Test team , so all of Australia ’ s international representatives were available for the whole season . Having scored only 91 runs at a batting average of 15 @.@ 16 , Harvey was dropped from the team . He did not play alongside Ray , who was dropped , and Merv , who had retired . It was Harvey 's last season for Fitzroy , and in 90 first @-@ grade matches , he scored 2 @,@ 601 runs at an average of 30 @.@ 24 . 
 = = Move to Queensland = = 
 At the time , Queensland were the least successful team in the Sheffield Shield , and Harvey moved north to Brisbane the following season to try to get more opportunities to play Sheffield Shield cricket . Harvey joined the Toombul grade club , and made his first @-@ class debut for Queensland against Victoria late in the season , although none of his brothers played for Victoria in this match ; Merv had already retired , Neil was representing Australia , and Ray had been dropped . In his only match for the summer , he scored 1 and 13 and took two catches in each innings as an opener . He was dropped after the match . 
 In 1950 – 51 , his most prolific first @-@ class season , he hit 490 runs at 37 @.@ 69 for Queensland . The season started with consecutive matches against a full @-@ strength New South Wales , who had an attack including Lindwall , Miller , Alan Walker and Alan Davidson . In the first match , in Brisbane , Harvey made 40 and 19 batting at No. 7 before being dismissed by Davidson and Lindwall respectively . The visitors won by an innings . 
 In the return match at the Sydney Cricket Ground , Harvey was promoted to bat at No. 3 . He made 38 in the first innings before being dismissed by Walker . Harvey broke through for his maiden first @-@ class century in the second innings , scoring an unbeaten 100 . Queensland declared at 4 / 237 as soon as he reached his milestone , only to see the hosts reach the victory target of 225 with all ten wickets intact . 
 Harvey played against an international outfit for the first time in the following match against the touring England cricket team , but made only three in his solitary innings . However , he continued to score consistently , making a half @-@ century in each of the next three matches . From the third of these matches — against South Australia — onwards , he generally opened the batting for Queensland . On his first innings back as an opener , he narrowly missed a century , being dismissed for 95 by Geff Noblet . However , it was enough for the Queenslanders to take a 162 @-@ run first innings lead in a low @-@ scoring match in which only one team surpassed 240 once , and set up an eight @-@ wicket victory , the only time his state won a match for the season . Harvey ’ s performance tapered away in the last two matches of the season . He made only 0 and 2 in the last match against Victoria , and 48 runs in his last four innings . 
 Harvey started the 1951 – 52 season poorly , scoring 9 and 5 against a full @-@ strength New South Wales team . In the following match , he made 90 in the first innings as Queensland defeated the touring West Indies by ten wickets . Harvey was sidelined for six weeks before returning in late December against Victoria . He struggled in this match and the next against New South Wales , scoring 9 , 20 , 9 and 3 . In the next match , he made 46 in the first innings before managing only five in the second , against South Australia . Nor did Queensland have success in these three matches . They were one wicket away from victory in the first match when time ran out , and lost the other two . Harvey was dropped for the remainder of the season , ending with 196 runs at 21 @.@ 77 . 
 Harvey was overlooked for Queensland selection for the whole 1952 – 53 season . He was recalled at the start of the 1953 – 54 campaign and made 26 and 20 in the first match against New South Wales , failing to convert his starts into big scores . He was retained despite making 15 and 0 in the next match against Victoria , but scored only 1 in the first innings of the match against South Australia starting on Christmas Day . Victoria were set 329 for victory , and having made only 62 runs in five innings for the season so far , he was the mainstay of the innings , scoring 102 , but his team were all out for 245 . 
 The century saw Harvey retained in the side and started a productive second half of the season . He made 2 and 58 in the next match starting on New Year ’ s Day , against New South Wales . Harvey then made 84 in the only innings of a drawn match against Victoria , before scoring 111 in an innings win against Western Australia . It was the first time in over two years that Harvey had played in a victorious Queensland side . He made only 2 in the final match of the season against South Australia to end with 421 runs at 38 @.@ 27 for the summer . 
 = = Decline = = 
 Harvey continued his good form at the start of the 1954 – 55 season , scoring 90 and 9 in the opening match against New South Wales . He then made 49 and 9 against the touring England cricket team of Len Hutton . In the Christmas match against South Australia , Harvey failed to capitalise on his starts , making 31 and 35 as Queensland won by 34 runs . The following week , he made only 0 and 3 not out in the New Year ’ s match against New South Wales . He finished the truncated season with only 16 in the following match against Victoria , ending the summer with 242 runs at 30 @.@ 25 . 
 Harvey had a poor season in 1955 – 56 . He scored only 37 runs in six completed innings in the first three matches . In the next match against Western Australia , he made only 8 in the first innings but scored 70 not out in the second innings as his team ’ s run @-@ chase petered away to a draw , and he retained his position in the team . He then made 17 and 28 in the next match against South Australia , run out in the latter innings after making a start . After making 10 and 20 in the next match against New South Wales , he was dropped for the remainder of the season , having made only 190 runs at 17 @.@ 27 for the season . 
 Recalled at the start of the 1956 – 57 season , Harvey made 40 and 28 in his first match of the summer against New South Wales , but after scoring only 2 and 2 not out against Western Australia in the next match , he was dropped for the final time . 
 Noted for his sound defence , he was a patient and dogged batsman , in contrast to the exciting styles of brothers Merv , Ray and Neil . According to Neil , Mick had a weakness against spin bowling . Harvey was a rare bowler during his first @-@ class career . He bowled only five overs in total , delivering one over in five different matches . He never took a wicket . Altogether , he made 1 @,@ 716 first @-@ class runs ( mostly as an opener ) in 37 matches at an average of 27 @.@ 23 . Harvey was also a regular choice for the Queensland baseball team during his career . His daughter Pauline Harvey @-@ Short represented Australia at softball , before becoming a sports administrator . She is a fellow of the Australian Council for Health , Physical Education and Recreation , and was a founding member of <unk> Queensland in 1993 , serving as the chair of the board from 2007 until 2010 . Her daughter Kirby Short plays cricket for the Queensland women 's team . 
 = = Umpiring career = = 
 After his retirement as a player , Harvey took up umpiring . His initial first @-@ class match was in 1974 – 75 , when he officiated in Queensland ’ s home match against Victoria late in the season ; at the time the host team provided both umpires . The following year , he was selected for four first @-@ class matches , one of which was against the touring West Indies . He also officiated in his first List A match , presiding over the final of Australia 's domestic limited @-@ overs tournament , which Queensland hosted against Western Australia . The following two seasons were similar ; Harvey stood in four first @-@ class matches including one against a touring international team , and one List A match , both of which were quarter @-@ finals . 
 In 1978 – 79 , Harvey ’ s appointments increased . Harvey stood in all of Queensland 's five home Shield matches , as well as their match against the touring Englishmen . He stood in one List A match involving Queensland and was then rewarded with his international debut in the second ODI between Australia and England at the SCG , before presiding over the next ODI at the MCG . At the end of the season , Harvey was selected for the first of his two Tests . The first , played by Australia against Pakistan at the MCG in March 1979 was dramatic . During the run @-@ chase , the Australians were stunned by a spell of 7 wickets for 1 run by Sarfraz Nawaz , just when they looked like winning . Sarfraz ended with 9 / 86 — the other wicket was run out — as Australia collapsed from 3 / 305 to 310 all out to lose by 71 runs . Harvey ’ s partner was Robin <unk> . 
 Harvey ’ s other Test match was between Australia and the West Indies at the MCG during the Christmas @-@ New Year period of 1979 – 80 . It was won by the visitors by 10 wickets , with a bowling attack of Andy Roberts , Michael Holding , Colin Croft , and Joel Garner proving too powerful for their hosts . Harvey ’ s colleague was Tony <unk> . Harvey also stood in four ODIs played during the inaugural World Series Cup that season , which involved England , Australia and the West Indies . He presided in three of the round @-@ robin matches , the third of which was between the two visiting teams at the Gabba . It was the only time that Harvey umpired a match at his adopted home ground . He later presided over the first match of the finals series , between the West Indies and England at the MCG . This was his sixth and final appointment at ODI level . Harvey also officiated three Shield matches , Queensland ’ s tour match against England and one of their domestic one @-@ dayers during the season . 
 The following season , Harvey presided over four of the five home Shield matches , a tour match by India , and a domestic one @-@ dayer , but was overlooked for an international fixture . Harvey ’ s final fixtures were during the 1981 – 82 season . He officiated in two matches hosted by Queensland in November , a Shield match and a one @-@ dayer , both against Queensland . Altogether , he umpired 31 first @-@ class and 13 List A matches in his career . He continued to umpire interstate matches at youth level until 1988 and stood in six finals the first grade of Queensland 's local competition . 
 = Schizophrenia = 
 Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand what is real . Common symptoms include false beliefs , unclear or confused thinking , hearing voices , reduced social engagement and emotional expression , and a lack of motivation . People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety disorders , major depressive illness , or substance use disorder . Symptoms typically come on gradually , begin in young adulthood , and last a long time . 
 The causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors . Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city , cannabis use , certain infections , parental age , and poor nutrition during pregnancy . Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants . Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the person 's reported experiences . During diagnosis a person 's culture must also be taken into account . As of 2013 there is no objective test . Schizophrenia does not imply a " split personality " or " multiple personality disorder " — a condition with which it has been confused with in public perception . 
 The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication along with counselling , job training , and social rehabilitation . It is unclear if typical or atypical antipsychotics are better . In those who do not improve with other antipsychotics , clozapine may be used . In more serious cases — where there is risk to self or others — involuntary hospitalization may be necessary , although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were . 
 About 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 7 % of people are affected by schizophrenia during their lifetime . In 2013 there was estimated to be 23 @.@ 6 million cases globally . Males are more often affected than females . About 20 % of people do well and a few recover completely . Social problems , such as long @-@ term unemployment , poverty , and homelessness are common . The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty @-@ five years less than the average . This is the result of increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate ( about 5 % ) . In 2013 an estimated 16 @,@ 000 people died from behavior related to , or caused by , schizophrenia . 
 = = Symptoms = = 
 Individuals with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations ( most reported are hearing voices ) , delusions ( often bizarre or persecutory in nature ) , and disorganized thinking and speech . The last may range from loss of train of thought , to sentences only loosely connected in meaning , to speech that is not understandable known as word salad . Social withdrawal , sloppiness of dress and hygiene , and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia . There is often an observable pattern of emotional difficulty , for example lack of responsiveness . Impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia , as are symptoms of paranoia . Social isolation commonly occurs . Difficulties in working and long @-@ term memory , attention , executive functioning , and speed of processing also commonly occur . In one uncommon subtype , the person may be largely mute , remain motionless in bizarre postures , or exhibit purposeless agitation , all signs of catatonia . About 30 to 50 percent of people with schizophrenia fail to accept that they have an illness or comply with their recommended treatment . Treatment may have some effect on insight . People with schizophrenia often find facial emotion perception to be difficult . 
 People with schizophrenia may have a high rate of irritable bowel syndrome but they often do not mention it unless specifically asked . 
 = = = Positive and negative = = = 
 Schizophrenia is often described in terms of positive and negative ( or deficit ) symptoms . Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience , but are present in people with schizophrenia . They can include delusions , disordered thoughts and speech , and tactile , auditory , visual , olfactory and gustatory hallucinations , typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis . Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme . Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication . 
 Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes , and are less responsive to medication . They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion , poverty of speech , inability to experience pleasure , lack of desire to form relationships , and lack of motivation . Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life , functional ability , and the burden on others than do positive symptoms . People with greater negative symptoms often have a history of poor adjustment before the onset of illness , and response to medication is often limited . 
 = = = Cognitive dysfunction = = = 
 Deficits in cognitive abilities are widely recognized as a core feature of schizophrenia . The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be , the quality of occupational performance , and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment . The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia has been reported to be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms . The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas : working memory , long @-@ term memory , verbal declarative memory , semantic processing , episodic memory , attention , learning ( particularly verbal learning ) . Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia , and are not accounted for by deficit in attention . Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode ( process information relating to meaning ) , which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long @-@ term memory . When given a list of words , healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently ( known as the Pollyanna principle ) ; however , individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations , suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words . These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent . First @-@ degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high @-@ risk individuals also show a degree of deficit in cognitive abilities , and specifically in working memory . A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence , or as early as childhood . The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients , or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables . 
 Although the evidence that cognitive deficits remain stable over time is reliable and abundant , much of the research in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory . Efforts to improve learning ability in individuals with schizophrenia using a high- versus low @-@ reward condition and an instruction @-@ absent or instruction @-@ present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance , highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance . Training individuals with schizophrenia to alter their thinking , attention , and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks , engaging in cognitive rehearsal , giving self @-@ instructions , giving coping statements to the self to handle failure , and providing self @-@ reinforcement for success , significantly improves performance on recall tasks . This type of training , known as self @-@ instructional ( SI ) training , produced benefits such as lower number of nonsense <unk> and improved recall while distracted . 
 = = = Onset = = = 
 Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia , critical years in a young adult 's social and vocational development . In 40 % of men and 23 % of women diagnosed with schizophrenia , the condition manifested itself before the age of 19 . To minimize the developmental disruption associated with schizophrenia , much work has recently been done to identify and treat the prodromal ( pre @-@ onset ) phase of the illness , which has been detected up to 30 months before the onset of symptoms . Those who go on to develop schizophrenia may experience transient or self @-@ limiting psychotic symptoms and the non @-@ specific symptoms of social withdrawal , irritability , dysphoria , and clumsiness during the prodromal phase . 
 = = Causes = = 
 A combination of genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of schizophrenia . People with a family history of schizophrenia who have a transient psychosis have a 20 – 40 % chance of being diagnosed one year later . 
 = = = Genetic = = = 
 Estimates of heritability vary because of the difficulty in separating genetic and environmental influences ; averages of 0 @.@ 80 have been given . The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first @-@ degree relative with the disease ( risk is 6 @.@ 5 % ) ; more than 40 % of <unk> twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected . If one parent is affected the risk is about 13 % and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50 % . 
 Many genes are believed to be involved in schizophrenia , each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression . Many possible candidates have been proposed , including specific copy number variations , <unk> , and histone protein loci . A number of genome @-@ wide associations such as zinc finger protein <unk> have also been linked . There appears to be overlap in the genetics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . Evidence is emerging that the genetic architecture of schizophrenia involved both common and rare risk variation . 
 Assuming a hereditary basis , one question from evolutionary psychology is why genes that increase the likelihood of psychosis evolved , assuming the condition would have been maladaptive from an evolutionary point of view . One idea is that genes are involved in the evolution of language and human nature , but to date such ideas remain little more than hypothetical in nature . 
 = = = Environment = = = 
 Environmental factors associated with the development of schizophrenia include the living environment , drug use , and prenatal stressors . 
 Parenting style seems to have no major effect , although people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents . Childhood trauma , death of a parent , and being bullied or abused increase the risk of psychosis . Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two , even after taking into account drug use , ethnic group , and size of social group . Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity , racial discrimination , family dysfunction , unemployment , and poor housing conditions . 
 It has been hypothesised that in some people , development of schizophrenia is related to intestinal tract dysfunction such as seen with non @-@ celiac gluten sensitivity or abnormalities in the intestinal flora . A subgroup of persons with schizophrenia present an immune response to gluten different from that found in people with celiac , with elevated levels of certain serum biomarkers of gluten sensitivity such as anti @-@ gliadin IgG or anti @-@ gliadin IgA antibodies . 
 = = = = Substance use = = = = 
 About half of those with schizophrenia use drugs or alcohol excessively . Amphetamine , cocaine , and to a lesser extent alcohol , can result in a transient stimulant psychosis or alcohol @-@ related psychosis that presents very similarly to schizophrenia . Although it is not generally believed to be a cause of the illness , people with schizophrenia use nicotine at much higher rates than the general population . 
 Alcohol abuse can occasionally cause the development of a chronic , substance @-@ induced psychotic disorder via a kindling mechanism . Alcohol use is not associated with an earlier onset of psychosis . 
 Cannabis can be a contributory factor in schizophrenia , potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk . The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or may be related to preexisting psychopathology . Early exposure is strongly associated with an increased risk . The size of the increased risk is not clear , but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis . Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses . 
 Other drugs may be used only as coping mechanisms by individuals who have schizophrenia , to deal with depression , anxiety , boredom , and loneliness . 
 = = = = Developmental factors = = = = 
 Factors such as hypoxia and infection , or stress and malnutrition in the mother during fetal development , may result in a slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life . People diagnosed with schizophrenia are more likely to have been born in winter or spring ( at least in the northern hemisphere ) , which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposures in utero . The increased risk is about five to eight percent . Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that may increase the risk include Toxoplasma <unk> and Chlamydia . 
 = = Mechanisms = = 
 A number of attempts have been made to explain the link between altered brain function and schizophrenia . One of the most common is the dopamine hypothesis , which attributes psychosis to the mind 's faulty interpretation of the misfiring of dopaminergic neurons . 
 = = = Psychological = = = 
 Many psychological mechanisms have been implicated in the development and maintenance of schizophrenia . Cognitive biases have been identified in those with the diagnosis or those at risk , especially when under stress or in confusing situations . Some cognitive features may reflect global neurocognitive deficits such as memory loss , while others may be related to particular issues and experiences . 
 Despite a demonstrated appearance of blunted affect , recent findings indicate that many individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia are emotionally responsive , particularly to stressful or negative stimuli , and that such sensitivity may cause vulnerability to symptoms or to the disorder . Some evidence suggests that the content of delusional beliefs and psychotic experiences can reflect emotional causes of the disorder , and that how a person interprets such experiences can influence symptomatology . The use of " safety behaviors " ( acts such as gestures or the use of words in specific contexts ) to avoid or neutralize imagined threats may actually contribute to the chronicity of delusions . Further evidence for the role of psychological mechanisms comes from the effects of psychotherapies on symptoms of schizophrenia . 
 = = = Neurological = = = 
 Schizophrenia is associated with subtle differences in brain structures , found in forty to fifty percent of cases , and in brain chemistry during acute psychotic states . Studies using neuropsychological tests and brain imaging technologies such as fMRI and PET to examine functional differences in brain activity have shown that differences seem to occur most commonly in the frontal lobes , hippocampus and temporal lobes . Reductions in brain volume , smaller than those found in Alzheimer 's disease , have been reported in areas of the frontal cortex and temporal lobes . It is uncertain whether these volumetric changes are progressive or exist prior to the onset of the disease . These differences have been linked to the neurocognitive deficits often associated with schizophrenia . Because neural circuits are altered , it has alternatively been suggested that schizophrenia should be thought of as a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders . There has been debate on whether treatment with antipsychotics can itself cause reduction of brain volume . 
 Particular attention has been paid to the function of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain . This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that <unk> drugs , which block dopamine function , could reduce psychotic symptoms . It is also supported by the fact that amphetamines , which trigger the release of dopamine , may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia . The influential dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that excessive activation of D2 receptors was the cause of ( the positive symptoms of ) schizophrenia . Although postulated for about 20 years based on the D2 blockade effect common to all antipsychotics , it was not until the mid @-@ 1990s that PET and <unk> imaging studies provided supporting evidence . The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be simplistic , partly because newer antipsychotic medication ( atypical antipsychotic medication ) can be just as effective as older medication ( typical antipsychotic medication ) , but also affects serotonin function and may have slightly less of a dopamine blocking effect . 
 Interest has also focused on the neurotransmitter glutamate and the reduced function of the NMDA glutamate receptor in schizophrenia , largely because of the abnormally low levels of glutamate receptors found in the postmortem brains of those diagnosed with schizophrenia , and the discovery that glutamate @-@ blocking drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine can mimic the symptoms and cognitive problems associated with the condition . Reduced glutamate function is linked to poor performance on tests requiring frontal lobe and hippocampal function , and glutamate can affect dopamine function , both of which have been implicated in schizophrenia ; this has suggested an important mediating ( and possibly causal ) role of glutamate pathways in the condition . But positive symptoms fail to respond to glutamatergic medication . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the American Psychiatric Association 's fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM 5 ) , or the World Health Organization 's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ( ICD @-@ 10 ) . These criteria use the self @-@ reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior , followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional . Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity before a diagnosis is made . As of 2013 there is no objective test . 
 = = = Criteria = = = 
 In 2013 , the American Psychiatric Association released the fifth edition of the DSM ( DSM @-@ 5 ) . To be diagnosed with schizophrenia , two diagnostic criteria have to be met over much of the time of a period of at least one month , with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months . The person had to be suffering from delusions , hallucinations , or disorganized speech . A second symptom could be negative symptoms , or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour . The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM ( DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR ) , but DSM @-@ 5 makes a number of changes . 
 <unk> classifications – such as catatonic and paranoid schizophrenia – are removed . These were retained in previous revisions largely for reasons of tradition , but had subsequently proved to be of little worth . 
 Catatonia is no longer so strongly associated with schizophrenia . 
 In describing a person 's schizophrenia , it is recommended that a better distinction be made between the current state of the condition and its historical progress , to achieve a clearer overall characterization . 
 Special treatment of Schneider 's first @-@ rank symptoms is no longer recommended . 
 <unk> disorder is better defined to demarcate it more cleanly from schizophrenia . 
 An assessment covering eight domains of psychopathology – such as whether hallucination or mania is experienced – is recommended to help clinical decision @-@ making . 
 The ICD @-@ 10 criteria are typically used in European countries , while the DSM criteria are used in the United States and to varying degrees around the world , and are prevailing in research studies . The ICD @-@ 10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian first @-@ rank symptoms . In practice , agreement between the two systems is high . 
 If signs of disturbance are present for more than a month but less than six months , the diagnosis of <unk> disorder is applied . Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder , and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified , while schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms . If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance , then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition . Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present . 
 = = = Subtypes = = = 
 With the publication of DSM @-@ 5 , the APA removed all sub @-@ classifications of schizophrenia . The five sub @-@ classifications included in DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR were : 
 Paranoid type : Delusions or auditory hallucinations are present , but thought disorder , disorganized behavior , or affective flattening are not . Delusions are persecutory and / or grandiose , but in addition to these , other themes such as jealousy , religiosity , or <unk> may also be present . ( DSM code 295 @.@ 3 / ICD code <unk> ) 
 Disorganized type : Named hebephrenic schizophrenia in the ICD . Where thought disorder and flat affect are present together . ( DSM code 295 @.@ 1 / ICD code <unk> ) 
 Catatonic type : The subject may be almost immobile or exhibit agitated , purposeless movement . Symptoms can include catatonic stupor and waxy flexibility . ( DSM code 295 @.@ 2 / ICD code <unk> ) 
 <unk> type : Psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid , disorganized , or catatonic types have not been met . ( DSM code 295 @.@ 9 / ICD code <unk> ) 
 Residual type : Where positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only . ( DSM code 295 @.@ 6 / ICD code <unk> ) 
 The ICD @-@ 10 defines two additional subtypes : 
 Post @-@ schizophrenic depression : A depressive episode arising in the aftermath of a schizophrenic illness where some low @-@ level schizophrenic symptoms may still be present . ( ICD code <unk> ) 
 Simple schizophrenia : Insidious and progressive development of prominent negative symptoms with no history of psychotic episodes . ( ICD code <unk> ) 
 Sluggish schizophrenia is in the Russian version of the ICD @-@ 10 . " Sluggish schizophrenia " is in the category of " <unk> " disorder in section <unk> of chapter V. 
 = = = Differential diagnosis = = = 
 Psychotic symptoms may be present in several other mental disorders , including bipolar disorder , borderline personality disorder , drug intoxication and drug @-@ induced psychosis . Delusions ( " non @-@ bizarre " ) are also present in delusional disorder , and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder , avoidant personality disorder and <unk> personality disorder . <unk> personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia . Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder ( OCD ) considerably more often than could be explained by chance , although it can be difficult to distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia . A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time . It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such . 
 A more general medical and neurological examination may be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia @-@ like symptoms , such as metabolic disturbance , systemic infection , syphilis , HIV infection , epilepsy , limbic encephalitis , and brain lesions . Stroke , multiple sclerosis , hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism and dementias such as Alzheimer 's disease , Huntington 's disease , frontotemporal dementia and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia @-@ like psychotic symptoms . It may be necessary to rule out a delirium , which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations , acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness , and indicates an underlying medical illness . Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication . In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder . There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia . While there is some evidence that early intervention in those with a psychotic episode may improve short @-@ term outcomes , there is little benefit from these measures after five years . Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the prodrome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended . Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group , by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) . Another preventative measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder , including cannabis , cocaine , and amphetamines . 
 = = Management = = 
 The primary treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications , often in combination with psychological and social supports . Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or ( if mental health legislation allows it ) involuntarily . Long @-@ term hospitalization is uncommon since <unk> beginning in the 1950s , although it still occurs . Community support services including drop @-@ in centers , visits by members of a community mental health team , supported employment and support groups are common . Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has a positive effect on the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia . 
 = = = Medication = = = 
 The first @-@ line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication , which can reduce the positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days . Antipsychotics , however , fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction . In those on antipsychotics , continued use decreases the risk of relapse . There is little evidence regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years . 
 The choice of which antipsychotic to use is based on benefits , risks , and costs . It is debatable whether , as a class , typical or atypical antipsychotics are better . <unk> , olanzapine , risperidone and clozapine may be more effective but are associated with greater side effects . Typical antipsychotics have equal drop @-@ out and symptom relapse rates to <unk> when used at low to moderate dosages . There is a good response in 40 – 50 % , a partial response in 30 – 40 % , and treatment resistance ( failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two or three different antipsychotics ) in 20 % of people . <unk> is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs ( " treatment @-@ resistant " or " refractory " schizophrenia ) , but it has the potentially serious side effect of <unk> ( lowered white blood cell count ) in less than 4 % of people . 
 Most people on antipsychotics have side effects . People on typical antipsychotics tend to have a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects while some <unk> are associated with considerable weight gain , diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome ; this is most pronounced with olanzapine , while risperidone and <unk> are also associated with weight gain . <unk> has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol . It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or <unk> dyskinesia , a rare but serious neurological disorder . 
 For people who are unwilling or unable to take medication regularly , long @-@ acting depot preparations of antipsychotics may be used to achieve control . They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications . When used in combination with psychosocial interventions they may improve long @-@ term adherence to treatment . The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year . 
 = = = Psychosocial = = = 
 A number of psychosocial interventions may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia including : family therapy , assertive community treatment , supported employment , cognitive remediation , skills training , token economic interventions , and psychosocial interventions for substance use and weight management . Family therapy or education , which addresses the whole family system of an individual , may reduce relapses and hospitalizations . Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive @-@ behavioral therapy ( CBT ) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal . Art or drama therapy have not been well @-@ researched . Music therapy has been shown to improve mental state and social functioning when paired with regular care . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Schizophrenia has great human and economic costs . It results in a decreased life expectancy by 10 – 25 years . This is primarily because of its association with obesity , poor diet , sedentary lifestyles , and smoking , with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role . Antipsychotic medications may also increase the risk . These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s . 
 Schizophrenia is a major cause of disability , with active psychosis ranked as the third @-@ most @-@ disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness . Approximately three @-@ fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16 @.@ 7 million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition . Some people do recover completely and others function well in society . Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support . About 85 % are unemployed . In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long @-@ term outcome occurs in 42 % , an intermediate outcome in 35 % and a poor outcome in 27 % . Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world . These conclusions , however , have been questioned . 
 There is a higher than average suicide rate associated with schizophrenia . This has been cited at 10 % , but a more recent analysis revises the estimate to 4 @.@ 9 % , most often occurring in the period following onset or first hospital admission . Several times more ( 20 to 40 % ) attempt suicide at least once . There are a variety of risk factors , including male gender , depression , and a high intelligence quotient . 
 Schizophrenia and smoking have shown a strong association in studies world @-@ wide . Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia , with estimates ranging from 80 to 90 % being regular smokers , as compared to 20 % of the general population . Those who smoke tend to smoke heavily , and additionally smoke cigarettes with high nicotine content . Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning . Among people with schizophrenia use of cannabis is also common . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Schizophrenia affects around 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 7 % of people at some point in their life , or 24 million people worldwide as of 2011 . It occurs 1 @.@ 4 times more frequently in males than females and typically appears earlier in men — the peak ages of onset are 25 years for males and 27 years for females . Onset in childhood is much rarer , as is onset in middle or old age . 
 Despite the prior belief that schizophrenia occurs at similar rates worldwide , its frequency varies across the world , within countries , and at the local and neighborhood level . This variation has been estimated to be fivefold . It causes approximately one percent of worldwide disability adjusted life years and resulted in 20 @,@ 000 deaths in 2010 . The rate of schizophrenia varies up to threefold depending on how it is defined . 
 In 2000 , the World Health Organization found the percentage of people affected and the number of new cases that develop each year is roughly similar around the world , with age @-@ standardized prevalence per 100 @,@ 000 ranging from 343 in Africa to 544 in Japan and Oceania for men , and from 378 in Africa to 527 in Southeastern Europe for women . About 1 @.@ 1 % of adults have schizophrenia in the United States . 
 = = History = = 
 In the early 20th century , the psychiatrist Kurt Schneider listed the forms of psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders . These are called first @-@ rank symptoms or Schneider 's first @-@ rank symptoms . They include delusions of being controlled by an external force , the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one 's conscious mind , the belief that one 's thoughts are being broadcast to other people , and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one 's thoughts or actions or that have a conversation with other hallucinated voices . Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria , the specificity of first @-@ rank symptoms has been questioned . A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider 's claims , and suggested that first @-@ rank symptoms should be de @-@ emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems . 
 The history of schizophrenia is complex and does not lend itself easily to a linear narrative . Accounts of a schizophrenia @-@ like syndrome are thought to be rare in historical records before the 19th century , although reports of irrational , unintelligible , or uncontrolled behavior were common . A detailed case report in 1797 concerning James Tilly Matthews , and accounts by Philippe Pinel published in 1809 , are often regarded as the earliest cases of the illness in the medical and psychiatric literature . The Latinized term dementia praecox was first used by German <unk> Heinrich Schule in 1886 and then in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder ( <unk> ) . In 1893 Emil Kraepelin borrowed the term from Schule and Pick and in 1899 introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder ( termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression ) . Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was probably caused by a long @-@ term , smouldering systemic or " whole body " disease process that affected many organs and peripheral nerves in the body but which affected the brain after puberty in a final decisive cascade . His use of the term " praecox " distinguished it from other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer 's disease which typically occur later in life . It is sometimes argued that the use of the term <unk> <unk> in 1852 by the French physician Bénédict Morel constitutes the medical discovery of schizophrenia . However , this account ignores the fact that there is little to connect Morel 's descriptive use of the term and the independent development of the dementia praecox disease concept at the end of the nineteenth century . 
 The word schizophrenia — which translates roughly as " splitting of the mind " and comes from the Greek roots <unk> ( <unk> , " to split " ) and <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> , " mind " ) — was coined by Eugen Bleuler in 1908 and was intended to describe the separation of function between personality , thinking , memory , and perception . American and British interpretations of Bleuler led to the claim that he described its main symptoms as four A 's : flattened affect , autism , impaired association of ideas , and ambivalence . Bleuler realized that the illness was not a dementia , as some of his patients improved rather than deteriorated , and thus proposed the term schizophrenia instead . Treatment was revolutionized in the mid @-@ 1950s with the development and introduction of chlorpromazine . 
 In the early 1970s , the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were the subject of a number of controversies which eventually led to the operational criteria used today . It became clear after the 1971 US – UK Diagnostic Study that schizophrenia was diagnosed to a far greater extent in America than in Europe . This was partly due to looser diagnostic criteria in the US , which used the DSM @-@ II manual , contrasting with Europe and its ICD @-@ 9 . David <unk> 's 1972 study , published in the journal Science under the title " On being sane in insane places " , concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the US was often subjective and unreliable . These were some of the factors leading to the revision not only of the diagnosis of schizophrenia , but the revision of the whole DSM manual , resulting in the publication of the DSM @-@ III in 1980 . 
 The term schizophrenia is commonly misunderstood to mean that affected persons have a " split personality " . Although some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may hear voices and may experience the voices as distinct personalities , schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct , multiple personalities ; the confusion arises in part due to the literal interpretation of Bleuler 's term " schizophrenia " ( Bleuler originally associated schizophrenia with dissociation , and included split personality in his category of schizophrenia ) . <unk> identity disorder ( having a " split personality " ) was also often misdiagnosed as schizophrenia based on the loose criteria in the DSM @-@ II . The first known misuse of the term to mean " split personality " was in an article by the poet T. S. Eliot in 1933 . Other scholars have traced earlier roots . Rather , the term means a " splitting of mental functions " , reflecting the presentation of the illness . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 In 2002 , the term for schizophrenia in Japan was changed from <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ byō ( <unk> , lit . " mind @-@ split disease " ) to <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ shō ( <unk> , lit . " integration disorder " ) to reduce stigma . The new name was inspired by the <unk> model ; it increased the percentage of people who were informed of the diagnosis from 37 to 70 % over three years . A similar change was made in South Korea in 2012 . A professor of psychiatry , Jim van Os , has proposed changing the English term to " psychosis spectrum syndrome " . 
 In the United States , the cost of schizophrenia — including direct costs ( outpatient , inpatient , drugs , and long @-@ term care ) and non @-@ health care costs ( law enforcement , reduced workplace productivity , and unemployment ) — was estimated to be $ 62 @.@ 7 billion in 2002 . The book and film A Beautiful Mind chronicles the life of John Forbes Nash , a Nobel Prize – winning mathematician who was diagnosed with schizophrenia . 
 = = = Violence = = = 
 Individuals with severe mental illness , including schizophrenia , are at a significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non @-@ violent crime . Schizophrenia has been associated with a higher rate of violent acts , although this is primarily due to higher rates of drug use . Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse , and parallel the overall rate in a region . What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial , but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors . 
 Media coverage relating to violent acts by individuals with schizophrenia reinforces public perception of an association between schizophrenia and violence . In a large , representative sample from a 1999 study , 12 @.@ 8 % of Americans believed that individuals with schizophrenia were " very likely " to do something violent against others , and 48 @.@ 1 % said that they were " somewhat likely " to . Over 74 % said that people with schizophrenia were either " not very able " or " not able at all " to make decisions concerning their treatment , and 70 @.@ 2 % said the same of money @-@ management decisions . The perception of individuals with psychosis as violent has more than doubled in prevalence since the 1950s , according to one meta @-@ analysis .

There have been trials on drugs with anti @-@ inflammatory activity , based on the premise that inflammation might play a role in the pathology of schizophrenia . 
 = County Route 115 ( Tompkins County , New York ) = 
 County Route 115 ( CR 115 ) is a northwest – southeast county highway located mostly within the town of Caroline in Tompkins County , New York , in the United States . It extends for 12 @.@ 8 miles ( 20 @.@ 6 km ) from the Tioga County line south of the hamlet of Speedsville to an intersection with New York State Route 79 ( NY 79 ) just north of the Caroline town line in the town of Dryden . The highway continues into Tioga County as CR 33 . The portion of CR 115 north of the hamlet of Guide Board Corners was originally designated as New York State Route 330 and maintained by the state of New York . NY 330 existed from the early 1930s to 1980 , when ownership and maintenance of the highway was transferred to Tompkins County . 
 = = Route description = = 
 CR 115 begins at the Tioga County line in the town of Caroline , where it connects to Tioga County 's CR 33 . The county highway passes a mountain to the west and the Owego River 's west branch to the east as it heads northward . It crosses Boyer Creek as 76 Road and enters the hamlet of Speedsville , a small community located on top of a mountain . Here , CR 115 turns to the northwest to run along the base of a valley surrounding Boyer Creek . The creek reaches its source at an intersection with <unk> Road ; however , CR 115 continues northwestward to serve the hamlet of Caroline Center . 
 Outside of Caroline Center , CR 115 heads northwestward through a small valley to the community of Guide Board Corners . In the center of the hamlet , CR 115 turns north off 76 Road to follow Central Chapel Road . The highway emerges from the valley 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of Guide Board Corners , at which point it meets CR 114 , a connector to NY 79 , and curves westward as Valley Road . CR 115 parallels the Sixmile Creek into the hamlet of Brooktondale , where it changes names once more to become Brooktondale Road . From Brooktondale , the route heads northwest alongside Sixmile Creek into the town of Dryden , where it ends at an intersection with NY 79 .

 In the early 19th century , construction commenced on a highway connecting the Catskill Turnpike ( modern NY 79 ) to the hamlet of Speedsville near the Tioga County line . It began at Boiceville ( known today as West Slaterville ) and passed through the communities of Guide Board Corners and Caroline Center on its way to Speedsville . The roadway was built by community labor during the summers of 1804 through 1808 and was named " 76 Road " . According to the Bicentennial history of the Town of Caroline , the name refers to the Revolutionary War : 
 The first bee for cutting the road through was held near Augustine Boyer 's on 4 July 1804 . It was opened and dedicated ... by the settlers on July 4 , 1808 . Mr. Boyer was requested to name the road . He replied that he would name it the " ' 76 Road " . Mr. Boyer explained that he had spent seven days obtaining the services of the commissioners and surveyors to lay out the road , and these days were representative of the seven years of the Revolutionary struggle , and since the day was 4 July , and the spirit of ' 76 was in the air , and other spirits in their bottles , he would give the name of " ' 76 Road " in honor of the spirit of cooperation and dedication that the people had in working together on the project , and to honor the memory of those who worked together in laying the foundations of our country in 1776 . 
 In the early 1910s , the state of New York upgraded a local highway connecting the Catskill Turnpike near the hamlet of <unk> to Brookton ( now Brooktondale ) . It was added to the state highway system on November 4 , 1914 . The state also intended on improving an extension of the roadway east to 76 Road and 76 Road itself from the modern junction of Boiceville , Valley , and Central Chapel Roads south to Speedsville ; however , construction advanced no farther southeastward than Guide Board Corners . The Brookton – Guide Board Corners highway was added to the state highway system on February 8 , 1921 .

 The <unk> – Guide Board Corners state highway was designated as NY 330 c . 1931 . The NY 330 designation was removed on January 24 , 1980 , and ownership and maintenance of its former routing was transferred from the state of New York to Tompkins County on April 1 , 1980 , as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . By 1994 , NY 330 's former routing was designated as part of CR 115 , which continued south from Guide Board Corners to Speedsville via 76 Road . 
 In late June 2006 , the Tompkins County Highway Division temporarily closed off 76 Road ( CR 115 ) from Central Chapel Road to Caroline Center due to underground damage caused by heavy rains . Vehicular traffic weighing more than 5 short tons ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) was detoured at Speedsville to follow West Creek Road to NY 79 while traffic weighing less than 5 tons was directed onto Buffalo Hill Road at Caroline Center .

 = Capybara = 
 The capybara ( Hydrochoerus <unk> ) is a large rodent of the genus Hydrochoerus of which the only other extant member is the lesser capybara ( Hydrochoerus <unk> ) . The capybara is the largest rodent in the world . Close relatives are guinea pigs and rock cavies , and it is more distantly related to the agouti , chinchillas , and the coypu . Native to South America , the capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests and lives near bodies of water . It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals , but usually lives in groups of 10 – 20 individuals . The capybara is not a threatened species and is hunted for its meat and hide and also for a grease from its thick fatty skin which is used in the pharmaceutical trade . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Its common name is derived from Tupi ka <unk> , a complex agglutination of <unk> ( leaf ) + <unk> ( slender ) + ú ( eat ) + ara ( a suffix for agent nouns ) , meaning " one who eats slender leaves " , or " grass @-@ eater " . The scientific name , both <unk> and <unk> , comes from Greek <unk> ( <unk> 
 = water ) + <unk> ( <unk> = 
 pig , hog ) . 
 = = Classification and phylogeny = = 
 The capybara and the lesser capybara belong to the subfamily <unk> along with the rock cavies . The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family <unk> . Since 2002 , molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and <unk> supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae . Paleontological classifications have yet to incorporate this new taxonomy and continue to use <unk> for all capybaras , while using <unk> for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives , such as <unk> . The taxonomy of fossil <unk> is also in a state of flux . In recent years , the diversity of fossil <unk> has been substantially reduced . This is largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual . In one instance , material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species , <unk> <unk> . 
 = = Description = = 
 The capybara has a heavy , barrel @-@ shaped body and short head , with reddish @-@ brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish @-@ brown underneath . Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin , an unusual trait among rodents . The animal lacks under hair , and guard hair differs little from over hair . Adult capybaras grow to 106 to 134 cm ( 3 @.@ 48 to 4 @.@ 40 ft ) in length , stand 50 to 62 cm ( 20 to 24 in ) tall at the withers , and typically weigh 35 to 66 kg ( 77 to 146 lb ) , with an average in the Venezuelan llanos of 48 @.@ 9 kg ( 108 lb ) . The top recorded weights are 91 kg ( 201 lb ) for a wild female from Brazil and 73 @.@ 5 kg ( 162 lb ) for a wild male from Uruguay . The dental formula is 1 @.@ 0 @.@ 1 @.@ 31 @.@ 0 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 . Capybaras have slightly webbed feet and vestigial tails . Their hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs ; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet . Their muzzles are blunt , with nostrils , and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads . Females are slightly heavier than males .

 Capybaras are semi @-@ aquatic mammals found throughout almost all countries of South America ( except Chile ) . They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water , such as lakes , rivers , swamps , ponds , and marshes , as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in tropical forest . Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches . They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares ( 25 acres ) in high @-@ density populations . 
 Many escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world . Sightings are fairly common in Florida , although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed . In 2011 , one was spotted in the Central Coast of California . 
 = = = Diet and predation = = = 
 Capybaras are herbivores , grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants , as well as fruit and tree bark . They are very selective feeders and will feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it . They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season , as fewer plants are available . While they eat grass during the wet season , they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season . Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter and therefore are not consumed at that time . The capybara 's jaw hinge is not perpendicular and they thus chew food by grinding back @-@ and @-@ forth rather than side @-@ to @-@ side . Capybaras are <unk> , meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora , to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet , and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food . They may also regurgitate food to <unk> again , similar to cud @-@ chewing by a cow . As is the case with other rodents , the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses ; their cheek teeth also grow continuously . 
 Like its cousin the guinea pig , the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize vitamin C , and capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of scurvy . 
 They can have a life span of 8 – 10 years on average , but live less than four years in the wild , as they are " a favourite food of jaguar , puma , ocelot , eagle and caiman " . The capybara is also the preferred prey of the anaconda . 
 = = Social organization = = 
 Capybaras are gregarious . While they sometimes live solitarily , they are more commonly found in groups that average 10 – 20 individuals , with two to four adult males , four to seven adult females , and the remainder juveniles . Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season when the animals gather around available water sources . Males establish social bonds , dominance , or , general group census . They can make dog @-@ like barks when threatened or when females are herding young . 
 Capybaras have two types of scent glands ; a <unk> , located on the snout , and anal glands . Both sexes have these glands , but males have much larger <unk> and use their anal glands more frequently . The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs . A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects like plants . These hairs have a longer @-@ lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras . Capybara scent @-@ mark by rubbing their <unk> on an object , or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands . Capybara can spread their scent further by urinating ; however , females usually mark without urinating and scent @-@ mark less frequently than males overall . Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in estrus . In addition to objects , males will also scent @-@ mark females . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 When in estrus , the female 's scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit . In addition , a female will alert males she is in estrus by whistling though her nose . During mating , the female has the advantage and mating choice . Capybaras mate only in water , and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male , she will either submerge or leave the water . Dominant males are highly protective of the females , but they usually cannot prevent all the subordinates from copulating . The larger the group , the harder it is for the male to watch all the females . Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate , but subordinate males , as a class , are responsible for more matings than each dominant male . The lifespan of the capybara 's sperm is longer than that of other rodents . 
 Capybara gestation is 130 – 150 days , and usually produces a litter of four capybara babies , but may produce between one and eight in a single litter . Birth is on land and the female will rejoin the group within a few hours of delivering the newborn capybaras , which will join the group as soon as they are mobile . Within a week , the young can eat grass , but will continue to suckle — from any female in the group — until weaned at about 16 weeks . The young will form a group within the main group . Alloparenting has been observed in this species . Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso , Brazil .
