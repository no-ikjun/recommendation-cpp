 Count Nikita Moiseevich Zotov ( Russian : <unk> <unk> <unk> , tr . Nikita Moiseevich Zotov ; IPA : [ nʲ <unk> <unk> <unk> ͡ ɕ ' <unk> ] ) ( 1644 – December 1717 ) was a childhood tutor and lifelong friend of Russian Tsar Peter the Great . Historians disagree on the quality of Zotov 's tutoring . Robert K. Massie , for example , praises his efforts , but Lindsey Hughes criticizes the education that he gave to the future tsar . 
 Not much is known about Zotov 's life aside from his connection to Peter . Zotov left Moscow for a diplomatic mission to Crimea in 1680 and returned to Moscow before 1683 . He became part of the " Jolly Company " , a group of several dozen of Peter 's friends that eventually became The All @-@ Joking , All @-@ Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters . Zotov was mockingly appointed " Prince @-@ Pope " of the Synod , and regularly led them in games and celebrations . He accompanied Peter on many important occasions , such as the Azov campaigns and the torture of the Streltsy after their uprising . Zotov held a number of state posts , including from 1701 a leading position in the Tsar 's personal secretariat . Three years before his death , Zotov married a woman 50 years his junior . He died in December 1717 of unknown causes .

 Alexis I , Tsar of Russia , married twice in his lifetime , first to Maria <unk> and then to Natalia Naryshkina after Maria 's death . Peter I was born to Natalia Naryshkina on 30 May 1672 . After the death of Tsar Alexis on 8 February 1676 , Peter 's half @-@ brother and godfather Feodor , the " semi @-@ invalid eldest surviving son of Maria <unk> " , became the Tsar of Russia . Ivan Miloslavsky , Feodor 's uncle , returned to Moscow from virtual exile as Governor of Astrakhan to become Chief Minister . His family had not been in power for some time as a result of Tsar Alexis ' remarriage . As a result , Ivan Miloslavsky hated the Naryshkin family , which included Peter , Natalia Naryshkina , and Natalia 's foster father , <unk> Matveyev . When a new ruling family took over , the previous ruling family was usually banished to a ceremonial position somewhere far from Moscow . Instead , Ivan Miloslavsky tried to arrest the <unk> , but Feodor would only permit him to exile <unk> Matveyev . Feodor was fond of his half @-@ brother Peter and Peter 's mother , and both were allowed to remain in the Kremlin in private apartments . 
 Most 17th @-@ century Muscovites received little education , and there were low levels of literacy even among the nobility , education for whom typically consisted of a little reading , writing , and a small amount of history and geography . Religious scholars were usually the exception to this rule and were often also taught grammar , mathematics , and foreign languages . Two of Tsar Alexis ' children — Feodor , and his sister <unk> Sophia — received a thorough education from the religious scholars of Kiev , and could speak Latin and Polish . 
 At the age of three , in 1674 or 1675 , Peter received a primer from Tsar Alexis to help him learn the alphabet ; two years later , Tsar Feodor suggested to Peter 's mother that he begin his studies . Estimates of the exact year when Peter 's tutoring began range widely ; numerous authors refer to a starting date as early as 1677 , and as late as 1683 , though multiple references specifically identify 12 March 1677 as the beginning of Peter 's tutoring . Nikita Zotov , a former church clerk , or " Duma secretary " from the tax @-@ collection department of the governmental bureaucracy , was chosen to teach Peter to read and write . 
 = = = Appointment and instruction = = = 
 Zotov was not a religious scholar , but he knew the Bible well — an important qualification for Tsaritsa Natalia . Although he did not expect it , he was well rewarded before he had even started his work , receiving from Feodor and the Tsaritsa , as well as Patriarch Joachim , gifts including a set of apartments , two new sets of clothing , and 100 rubles . He was also raised to the rank of a minor nobleman . Zotov was deeply humbled and overwhelmed by the Tsaritsa 's request , and was enthralled at the prospect of teaching Peter . Zotov and Peter quickly became good friends , and Zotov remained close to Peter until the former 's death . 
 Peter 's first lesson began the morning after Zotov was appointed . After the books were sprinkled with holy water , Zotov began his instruction ; first in the alphabet , and then the Prayer Book . He taught the Bible , from which Peter learned long passages that he could still recite from memory forty years later . Zotov also taught his student to sing , and in his later years Peter often spontaneously accompanied choirs at church services . Although initially tasked only to teach reading and writing , Zotov found Peter to be intellectually curious , and interested in all that he could impart . Peter asked for lessons on Russian history , battles , and heroes . At Zotov 's request , the Tsaritsa ordered engravings of " foreign cities and palaces , sailing ships , weapons and historical events " to be brought from the Ordnance Office . Zotov placed them in the study room , along with a somewhat accurate globe for the time , to divert Peter when he became bored with his studies . Other informal " makeshift " tutors ( foreign and domestic ) and servants , were brought in for rowdy outdoor games with live ammunition . They were also to instruct Peter in other subjects such as royal and military history , blacksmithing , carpentry , joinery , printing , and , unusually for Russian nobility at the time , sailing and shipbuilding . 
 = = = Impact = = = 
 Zotov became one of Peter 's first friends , and the two remained close throughout Zotov 's life . Lindsey Hughes , a 20th @-@ century historian , has criticized Zotov for giving Peter an education that did not teach what a future tsar ought to know . Her contemporary , Robert K. Massie , has argued that the education was the best possible one for a curious boy like Peter , because it was unlikely that he would ever become tsar , as his half @-@ brother , Ivan V , was before him in the line of succession . According to Massie , although Zotov may have not taught Peter at the highest possible level , he delivered " the best education for a mind like Peter 's " , as it " stimulated [ Peter 's ] curiosity " and allowed him to become " in large part , a self @-@ taught man " . Zotov 's closeness to the Tsar later became a source of worry to others in government , many of whom — including even the powerful Menshikov — feared his influence . 
 In 1680 , Zotov embarked on a three @-@ year diplomatic mission to the Crimea ; sources disagree on whether this was before or after he tutored Peter . When Peter left the Kremlin to spend his childhood at <unk> , two years after Zotov 's departure , his memories of the tutors who had taught his siblings , Feodor and Sophia , were so negative that he cut himself off from traditional academic subjects for a time . He later resumed his studies under <unk> <unk> and Zotov after the latter 's return from the Crimea . Although Peter sought to learn of nature and military matters rather than literature or theology , he nevertheless learned a great deal of the latter from his tutors . Zotov ( and later his sons ) later worked with Peter to translate books about fortification from a Western European language into Russian . Peter did not learn , or forgot , a great deal about mathematics , a subject that he had to learn properly in his late teens for use in siege warfare and fortification . In later years , Peter regretted his lack of a fuller education , and sought to give his daughters Anne and Elizabeth educations equivalent of any European princess . 
 = = Prince @-@ Pope of Drunken Synod = = 
 In 1692 , Peter , who by then was Tsar of Russia , organized himself and several dozen of his friends into The All @-@ Joking , All @-@ Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters , a " synod " that parodied religion . Although he had a reputation for sobriety and fasting , Zotov was appointed the " Prince @-@ Pope " of the Synod because of that very fact . He was sometimes even referred to as Patriarch Bacchus . Peter forced him to participate in the parties even when Zotov claimed sickness and exhaustion . 
 However , Zotov soon grew to be a key participant in the mocking celebrations . After first drinking to everyone 's health , he " blessed " the group with the Sign of the Cross , using two long Dutch pipes . On holidays , the games were played on the streets of Moscow , and at Christmas , the Jolly Company rode around the city singing on sleighs , with Zotov at their head , on a sleigh pulled by twelve bald men . Zotov wore a highly unusual costume — his outfit was adorned with playing cards ; he wore a tin hat ; and he sat upon a barrel . During the first week of Lent , a procession of " penitents " followed Zotov through the city on donkeys , oxen , and sleighs pulled by goats , pigs , and bears . 
 = = High office = = 
 In 1695 and 1696 , Peter the Great mounted two campaigns against the Turkish garrison of Azov . Though the campaign in 1695 was ultimately unsuccessful , the 1696 one succeeded . The Russians surrounded the city with both men and ships and breached the wall , causing the Pasha of Azov to " surrender under honorable conditions " . The people of Moscow were amazed by the news of the surrender ; not since the reign of Peter 's father Alexis had a Russian army been victorious . Peter delayed his return home to allow Andrew <unk> , another member of the All @-@ Joking Company , time to set up a victory parade through the capital . The army returned home on 10 October , but instead of a traditional Orthodox reception , the army marched through an arch seemingly supported by Hercules and Mars . Contrary to the custom for a tsar , Peter did not ride at the head of the procession , but instead allowed it to be led by 18 horsemen leading carriages carrying Zotov and the war hero Fedor Golovin . 
 While on a tour of Europe in 1698 , Peter learned that the Streltsy had rebelled , and immediately rushed home from Vienna . After defeating the rebellious regiments , Peter angrily ordered the torture of those who had incited the Streltsy to rebel . For almost a month and a half , men from Peter 's Jolly Company , including Fyodor <unk> , Boris Golitsyn , and Zotov , led the torture in secret . 
 In 1701 , Zotov was made the head of the Tsar 's newly created Privy Council , a committee akin to the defunct Duma . In 1710 , Peter made Zotov a count , and a year later when Peter set up the Governing Senate , he appointed Zotov to oversee the Senate . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Nikita Zotov was twice married , and had three sons from his first marriage . One was Vasily Zotov ( d . 1729 ) , who was educated outside of Russia and became the Revisor @-@ General of <unk> ( Inspector General of Decrees ) in November 1715 . As Inspector General , it was Vasily 's job to preside over the Senate , enforce its decrees , and report absent senators to Peter . Vasily had little political power however , and so was unable to fulfill his role in opposition to the wishes of some of the most powerful men in the Russian empire . The second son was Ivan Zotov ( 1687 – 1723 ) , who lived and studied in France , where he worked as a translator . The third son , Konon Zotov ( 1690 – 30 December 1742 ) , studied in England , and served in various positions in the Russian Navy and in the Russian judicial system . 
 According to Robert K. Massie and Lindsey Hughes , Peter told Zotov in October 1713 that he intended to have him marry a second time , to Anna <unk> , a widow 50 years Zotov 's junior , despite Zotov 's wish to spend his final years in a monastery . However , the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary and Sergey Solovyov say that Zotov came up with the idea to marry <unk> in 1714 , and that his plan to become a monk was merely a joke . 
 The wedding was described by Friedrich Christian Weber , the ambassador of Hanover , as " solemnized by the court in masks " . Guests were instructed to pre @-@ register in groups of three with their costumes so as not to look too similar to other guests . Witnesses described the event , which took place on 27 and 28 January 1715 , and which had been prepared for three months , as a " world turned upside @-@ down " . The Jolly Company dressed in ridiculous regalia , and many people behaved exactly opposite to the norm ; " invitations to the guests were delivered by <unk> , the <unk> were cripples , the runners were fat men with gout , the priest was allegedly one hundred years old " ( and blind ) . Hughes notes that the event may have been a " variation on the Western charivari or shaming ceremonies " , through which the Tsar could demonstrate how much power he had over his subjects ' lives . During the wedding , the Drunken Synod routinely sang carols in the streets of Moscow and demanded money , which became a New Year tax for the wealthy . 
 = = Death = = 
 Nikita Zotov died in December 1717 of unknown causes . Peter wasted no time in moving on , at least publicly ; he replaced Zotov as " Prince @-@ Pope " with Peter Buturlin by " electing " him on 28 December 1717 , and appointing him on 10 January 1718 . Peter even ordered that Zotov 's widow be married to Buturlin in the fall of 1721 . There was a disagreement between Konon Zotov and his stepmother over the division of Nikita Zotov 's estate ; Konon tried to declare Nikita 's second marriage illegitimate , to avoid having to give any money to his stepmother 's family . 
 = Synthpop = 
 Synthpop ( also known as electropop and technopop ) is a genre of popular music that first became prominent in the late 1970s which features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument . It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock , electronic , art rock , disco , and particularly the " Krautrock " of bands like Kraftwerk . It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post @-@ punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late @-@ 1970s to the mid @-@ 1980s . 
 Early synthpop pioneers included Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra and British bands Ultravox and The Human League ; the latter largely used monophonic synthesizers to produce music with a simple and austere sound . After the breakthrough of Gary Numan and his band Tubeway Army in the British Singles Chart in 1979 , large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer @-@ based sound in the early 1980s , including Soft Cell , Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Depeche Mode in the United Kingdom , while in Japan , Yellow Magic Orchestra 's success opened the way for synthpop bands such as P @-@ Model , Plastics , and <unk> . The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers , the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats , led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synthpop . This , its adoption by the style @-@ conscious acts from the New Romantic movement , together with the rise of MTV , led to success for large numbers of British synthpop acts , including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet , in the United States . 
 In the late 1980s , duos such as Erasure and Pet Shop Boys adopted a sound that was highly successful on the US dance charts , but by the end of the decade synthpop had largely been abandoned . Interest began to be revived in the indietronica and electroclash movements in the late 1990s and , in the first decade of the 21st century , it enjoyed a widespread revival with commercial success for acts including La Roux , Lady Gaga , Kesha , Owl City , M83 and Chvrches . 
 The genre has received criticism for alleged lack of emotion and musicianship ; prominent artists have spoken out against detractors who believed that synthesizers themselves composed and played the songs . Some artists like Depeche Mode , who helped popularise the genre , were criticised for gender bending . Synthpop helped to establish the place of the synthesizer as a major element of pop and rock music , directly influenced subsequent genres including house music and Detroit techno , and has indirectly influenced many other genres and individual recordings . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Synthpop was defined by its primary use of synthesizers , drum machines and sequencers , sometimes using them to replace all other instruments . Borthwick and Moy have described the genre as diverse but " ... characterised by a broad set of values that eschewed rock playing styles , rhythms and structures " , which were replaced by " synthetic textures " and " robotic rigidity " , often defined by the limitations of the new technology , including monophonic synthesizers ( only able to play one note at a time ) . Many synthpop musicians had limited musical skills , relying on the technology to produce or reproduce the music . The result was often minimalist , with grooves that were " typically woven together from simple repeated riffs often with no harmonic ' progression ' to speak of " . Early synthpop has been described as " eerie , sterile , and vaguely menacing " , using droning electronics with little change in inflection . Common lyrical themes of synthpop songs were isolation , urban anomie , and feelings of being emotionally cold and hollow . 
 In its second phase in the 1980s , the introduction of dance beats and more conventional rock instrumentation made the music warmer and catchier and contained within the conventions of three @-@ minute pop . Synthesizers were increasingly used to imitate the conventional and clichéd sound of orchestras and horns . Thin , treble @-@ dominant , synthesized melodies and simple drum programmes gave way to thick , and compressed production , and a more conventional drum sound . Lyrics were generally more optimistic , dealing with more traditional subject matter for pop music such as romance , escapism and aspiration . According to music writer Simon Reynolds , the hallmark of 1980s synthpop was its " emotional , at times operatic singers " such as Marc Almond , Alison Moyet and Annie Lennox . Because synthesizers removed the need for large groups of musicians , these singers were often part of a duo where their partner played all the instrumentation . 
 Although synthpop in part arose from punk rock , it abandoned punk 's emphasis on authenticity and often pursued a deliberate artificiality , drawing on the critically derided forms such as disco and glam rock . It owed relatively little to the foundations of early popular music in jazz , folk music or the blues , and instead of looking to America , in its early stages , it consciously focused on European and particularly Eastern European influences , which were reflected in band names like Spandau Ballet and songs like Ultravox 's " Vienna " . Later synthpop saw a shift to a style more influenced by other genres , such as soul music .

 = = = Precursors = = = 
 Electronic musical synthesizers that could be used practically in a recording studio became available in the mid @-@ 1960s , around the same time as rock music began to emerge as a distinct musical genre . The Mellotron , an electro @-@ mechanical , polyphonic sample @-@ playback keyboard was overtaken by the Moog synthesizer , created by Robert Moog in 1964 , which produced completely electronically generated sounds . The portable Mini @-@ moog , which allowed much easier use , particularly in live performance was widely adopted by progressive rock musicians such as Richard Wright of Pink Floyd and Rick Wakeman of Yes . Instrumental prog rock was particularly significant in continental Europe , allowing bands like Kraftwerk , Tangerine Dream , Can and Faust to circumvent the language barrier . Their synthesizer @-@ heavy " Kraut rock " , along with the work of Brian Eno ( for a time the keyboard player with Roxy Music ) , would be a major influence on subsequent synth rock . 
 In 1971 the British movie A Clockwork Orange was released with a synth soundtrack by American Wendy Carlos . It was the first time many in the United Kingdom had heard electronic music . Philip Oakey of the Human League and Richard H. Kirk of Cabaret Voltaire , as well as music journalist Simon Reynolds , have cited the soundtrack as an inspiration . Electronic music made occasional moves into the mainstream , with jazz musician Stan Free , under the pseudonym Hot Butter , having a top 10 hit in the United States and United Kingdom in 1972 , with a cover of the 1969 Gershon Kingsley song " Popcorn " using a Moog synthesizer , which is recognised as a forerunner to synthpop and disco . 
 The mid @-@ 1970s saw the rise of electronic art musicians such as Jean Michel Jarre , Vangelis , and Tomita . Tomita 's album Electric Samurai : Switched on Rock ( 1972 ) featured electronic renditions of contemporary rock and pop songs , while utilizing speech synthesis and analog music sequencers . In 1975 , Kraftwerk played their first British show and inspired concert attendees Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark to throw away their guitars and become a synth act . Kraftwerk had its first hit UK record later in the year with " Autobahn " , which reached number 11 in the British Singles Chart . The group was described by the BBC Four program Synth Britannia as the key to synthpop 's future rise there . Italy 's Giorgio Moroder paired up with Donna Summer in 1977 to release the electronic disco song " I Feel Love " , and its programmed beats would be a major influence on the later synthpop sound . David Bowie 's Berlin Trilogy , comprising the albums Low ( 1977 ) , " Heroes " ( 1977 ) , and Lodger ( 1979 ) , all featuring Brian Eno , would also be highly influential . 
 = = = Origins ( 1977 – 80 ) = = = 
 Early guitar @-@ based punk rock that came to prominence in the period 1976 – 77 was initially hostile to the " inauthentic " sound of the synthesizer , but many new wave and post @-@ punk bands that emerged from the movement began to adopt it as a major part of their sound . British punk and New wave clubs were open to what was then considered an " alternative " sound . The do it yourself attitude of punk broke down the progressive rock era 's norm of needing years of experience before getting up on stage to play synthesizers . The American duo Suicide , who arose from the post @-@ punk scene in New York , utilised drum machines and synthesizers in a hybrid between electronics and post @-@ punk on their eponymous 1977 album . 
 The Cat Stevens album <unk> , released in April 1977 , updated his pop rock style with the extensive use of synthesizers , giving it a more synthpop style ; " Was Dog a Doughnut " in particular was an early techno @-@ pop fusion track , which made early use of a music sequencer . <unk> reached No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart , while the song " ( Remember the Days of the ) Old <unk> " was a top 40 hit . That same month , The Beach Boys released their album Love You , performed almost entirely by bandleader Brian Wilson with Moog and ARP synthesizers , and with arrangements somewhat inspired by Wendy Carlos 's Switched @-@ On Bach ( 1968 ) . Although it was highly praised by some critics and musicians ( including Patti Smith and Lester Bangs ) , the album met with poor commercial reception . The album has been considered revolutionary in its use of synthesizers , while others described Wilson 's extensive use of the Moog synthesizer as a " loopy funhouse ambience " and an early example of synthpop . In July 1977 , Donna Summer released " I Feel Love " , written and produced by Giorgio Moroder , pioneering the Hi @-@ NRG genre , and influencing later synthpop acts such as Divine and Dead or Alive . Around this time , Ultravox member Warren Cann purchased a Roland TR @-@ 77 drum machine , which was first featured in their October 1977 single release " Hiroshima Mon Amour " . 
 Be @-@ Bop Deluxe released Drastic Plastic in February 1978 , leading off with the single " Electrical Language " with Bill Nelson on guitar synthesizer and Andy Clark on synthesizers . Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra ( <unk> ) with their self @-@ titled album ( 1978 ) and Solid State Survivor ( 1979 ) , developed a " fun @-@ loving and breezy " sound , with a strong emphasis on melody . They introduced the TR @-@ 808 rhythm machine to popular music , and the band would be a major influence on early British synthpop acts . 1978 also saw the release of UK band The Human League 's début single " Being Boiled " , and in the US Devo began moving towards a more electronic sound . At this point synthpop gained some critical attention , but made little impact on the commercial charts . 
 British punk @-@ influenced band Tubeway Army , intended their debut album to be guitar driven . In 1978 , Gary Numan , a member of the group , found a minimoog left behind in the studio by another band , and started experimenting with it . This led to a change in the album 's sound to electronic new wave . Numan later described his work on this album as a guitarist playing keyboards , who turned " punk songs into electronic songs " . A single from the album , " Are Friends Electric ? " , topped the UK charts in the summer of 1979 . The discovery that synthesizers could be employed in a different manner from that used in progressive rock or disco , prompted Numan to go solo . On his futuristic album The Pleasure Principle ( 1979 ) , he played only synths , but retained a bass guitarist and a drummer for the rhythm section . A single from the album , " Cars " topped the charts . 
 Giorgio Moroder collaborated with the band Sparks on their album No. 1 In Heaven ( 1979 ) . That same year in Japan , the synthpop band P @-@ Model made its debut with the album In a Model Room . Other Japanese synthpop groups emerging around the same time included the Plastics and <unk> . This zeitgeist of revolution in electronic music performance and recording / production was encapsulated by then would @-@ be record producer Trevor Horn of The Buggles in the international hit " Video Killed the Radio Star " ( 1979 ) . 
 1980 also saw the release of where " Video Killed the Radio Star " came from , the Buggles ' debut album The Age of Plastic , which some writers have labeled as the first landmark of another electropop era , as well as what for many is the defining album of Devo 's career , the overtly synthpop Freedom of Choice . 
 = = = Commercial success ( 1981 – 85 ) = = = 
 The emergence of synthpop has been described as " perhaps the single most significant event in melodic music since Mersey @-@ beat " . By the 1980s synthesizers had become much cheaper and easier to use . After the definition of MIDI in 1982 and the development of digital audio , the creation of purely electronic sounds and their manipulation became much simpler . Synthesizers came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s , particularly through their adoption by bands of the New Romantic movement . 
 The New Romantic scene had developed in the London nightclubs Billy 's and The Blitz and was associated with bands such as Duran Duran , Visage , and Spandau Ballet . They adopted an elaborate visual style that combined elements of glam rock , science fiction and romanticism . Duran Duran have been credited with incorporating dance beats into synthpop to produce a catchier and warmer sound , which provided them with a series of hit singles . They would soon be followed into the British charts by a large number of bands utilising synthesizers to create catchy three @-@ minute pop songs . A new line @-@ up for the Human League along with a new producer and a more commercial sound led to the album Dare ( 1981 ) , which produced a series of hit singles . These included " Don 't You Want Me " , which reached number one in the UK at the end of 1981 . 
 Synthpop reached its commercial peak in the UK in the winter of 1981 – 2 , with bands such as Soft Cell , Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark , Japan , Ultravox , Depeche Mode and even Kraftwerk , enjoying top ten hits . In early 1982 synthesizers were so dominant that the Musicians Union attempted to limit their use . By the end of 1982 , these acts had been joined in the charts by synth @-@ based singles from Thomas Dolby , Blancmange , and Tears for Fears . The proliferation of acts led to an anti @-@ synth backlash , with groups including Spandau Ballet , Human League , Soft Cell and ABC incorporating more conventional influences and instruments into their sounds . 
 In the US , where synthpop is considered a subgenre of new wave and was described as " technopop " by the press at the time , the genre became popular due to the cable music channel MTV , which reached the media capitals of New York City and Los Angeles in 1982 . It made heavy use of style @-@ conscious New Romantic synthpop acts , with " I Ran ( So Far Away ) " ( 1982 ) by A Flock of Seagulls generally considered the first hit by a British act to enter the Billboard Top Ten as a result of exposure through video . The switch to a " new music " format in US radio stations was also significant in the success of British bands . The success of synthpop and other British acts would be seen as a Second British Invasion . Synthpop was taken up across the world , with international hits for acts including Men Without Hats and Trans X from Canada , Telex from Belgium , Peter Schilling , Sandra , Modern Talking , Propaganda and Alphaville from Germany , and Yello from Switzerland . 
 In the mid @-@ 1980s , key artists included solo performer Howard Jones , who S.T. Erlewine has stated to have " merged the technology @-@ intensive sound of new wave with the cheery optimism of hippies and late- ' 60s pop " , ( although with notable exceptions including the lyrics of " What Is Love ? " – " Does anybody love anybody anyway ? " ) and Nik Kershaw , whose " well @-@ craft synthpop " incorporated guitars and other more traditional pop influences that particularly appealed to a teen audience . Pursuing a more dance @-@ orientated sound were Bronski Beat whose album The Age of Consent ( 1984 ) , dealing with issues of homophobia and alienation , reached the top 20 in the UK and top 40 in the US. and Thompson Twins , whose popularity peaked in 1984 with the album Into The Gap , which reached No.1 in the UK and the US top ten and spawned several top ten singles . Initially dismissed in the music press as a " teeny bop sensation " were Norwegian band a @-@ ha , whose use of guitars and real drums produced an accessible form of synthpop , which , along with a MTV friendly video , took single " Take On Me " ( 1985 ) to number two in the UK and number one in the US . 
 = = = Declining popularity ( 1986 – 2000 ) = = = 
 Synthpop continued into the late 1980s , with a format that moved closer to dance music , including the work of acts such as British duos Pet Shop Boys , Erasure and The Communards . The Communards ' major hits were covers of disco classics " Don 't Leave Me This Way " ( 1986 ) and " Never Can Say Goodbye " ( 1987 ) . After adding other elements to their sound , and with the help of a gay audience , several synthpop acts had success on the US dance charts . Among these were American acts Information Society who had two top 10 singles in 1988 , Anything Box , and Red Flag . British band When In Rome scored a hit with their debut single " The Promise " . Several German synthpop acts of the late 1980s included Camouflage , Cetu <unk> , <unk> and Celebrate the Nun . Canadian duo Kon Kan had major success with their debut single , " I Beg Your Pardon " . 
 An American backlash against European synthpop has been seen as beginning in the mid @-@ 1980s with the rise of heartland rock and roots rock . In the UK the arrival of indie rock bands , particularly The Smiths , has been seen as marking the end of synth @-@ driven new wave and the beginning of the guitar @-@ based music that would dominate rock into the 1990s . By 1991 , in the United States synthpop was losing its commercial viability as alternative radio stations were responding to the popularity of grunge rock . Exceptions that continued to pursue forms of synthpop or rock in the 1990s were Savage Garden , The Rentals , and The Moog Cookbook . Electronic music was also explored from the early 1990s by indietronica bands like Stereolab and Disco Inferno , who mixed a variety of indie and synthesizer sounds .

 <unk> began to take off in the new millennium as the new digital technology developed , with acts such as Broadcast from the UK , Justice from France , Lali Puna from Germany , and Ratatat and The Postal Service from the US , mixing a variety of indie sounds with electronic music , largely produced on small independent labels . Similarly , the electroclash subgenre began in New York at the end of the 1990s , combining synthpop , techno , punk and performance art . It was pioneered by I @-@ F with their track " Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass " ( 1998 ) , and pursued by artists including Felix da Housecat , Peaches , Chicks on Speed , and Fischerspooner . It gained international attention at the beginning of the new millennium and spread to scenes in London and Berlin , but rapidly faded as a recognizable genre as acts began to experiment with a variety of forms of music . 
 In the new millennium , renewed interest in electronic music and nostalgia for the 1980s led to the beginnings of a synthpop revival , with acts including Adult and Fischerspooner . In 2003 – 04 it began to move into the mainstream with Ladytron , the Postal Service , Cut Copy , the Bravery and The Killers all producing records that incorporated vintage synthesizer sounds and styles that contrasted with the dominant genres of post @-@ grunge and nu metal . In particular , The Killers enjoyed considerable airplay and exposure and their debut album Hot Fuss ( 2004 ) reached the top ten of the Billboard 200 . The Killers , the Bravery and the Stills all left their synthpop sound behind after their debut albums and began to explore classic 1970s rock , but the style was picked up by a large number of performers , particularly female solo artists . Following the breakthrough success of Lady Gaga with her single " Just Dance " ( 2008 ) , the British and other media proclaimed a new era of female synthpop stars , citing artists such as Roisin Murphy , Little Boots , La Roux , and Ladyhawke . Male acts that emerged in the same period include Calvin Harris , Empire of the Sun , Frankmusik , Hurts , Kaskade , LMFAO , and Owl City , whose single " Fireflies " ( 2009 ) topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart . In 2009 , an underground subgenre with direct stylistic origins to Synthpop became popular , <unk> . It sprouted new stars in the independent music scene like Washed Out , Neon Indian , and Toro Y Moi . 
 American singer @-@ songwriter Kesha has also been described as a synthpop artist , with her synthesized debut single " Tik Tok " topping the Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks in 2010 . She also used the genre on her comeback single " Die Young " . Mainstream female recording artists who have had success in the genre in the 2010s are Madonna , Katy Perry , Jessie J , Christina Aguilera , and Beyonce . 
 In Japan , girl @-@ group Perfume , along with producer Yasutaka Nakata of capsule , produced technopop music combining 1980s synthpop with chiptunes and electro house from 2003 . Their breakthrough came in 2008 with the album Game , which led to a renewed interest in technopop within mainstream Japanese pop music . Other Japanese female technopop artists soon followed , including Aira Mitsuki , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Sweet Vacation . Model @-@ singer Kyary Pamyu Pamyu also shared the same success as Perfume 's under Nakata 's production with the album Pamyu Pamyu Revolution in 2012 , which topped electronic charts on iTunes as well as the Japanese Albums chart . Much like Japan , Korean pop music has also become dominated by synthpop , particularly with girl groups such as Girls ' Generation and Wonder Girls . Other 2010s synthpop acts include Chvrches , M83 and The <unk> 
 = = Criticism = = 
 Synthpop has received considerable criticism and even prompted hostility among musicians and in the press . It has been described as " anaemic " and " soulless " . Synthpop 's early steps , and Gary Numan in particular , were also disparaged in the British music press of the late 1970s and early 1980s for their German influences and characterised by journalist Mick Farren as the " Adolf Hitler Memorial Space Patrol " . In 1983 , Morrissey of The Smiths stated that " there was nothing more repellent than the synthesizer " . During the decade , objections were raised to the quality of compositions and the limited musicianship of artists . Gary Numan observed " hostility " and " a lot of ignorance " toward synthpop , with detractors erroneously believing that " machines did it " . 
 Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark frontman Andy McCluskey recalled a great many people " who thought that the equipment wrote the song for you " , and asserted : " Believe me , if there was a button on a synth or a drum machine that said ' hit single ' , I would have pressed it as often as anybody else would have – but there isn 't . It was all written by real human beings , and it was all played by hand " . 
 According to Simon Reynolds , in some quarters synthesizers were seen as instruments for " effete poseurs " , in contrast to the phallic guitar . The association of synthpop with an alternative sexuality was reinforced by the images projected by synthpop stars , who were seen as gender bending , including Phil Oakey 's asymmetric hair and use of eyeliner , Marc Almond 's " <unk> " leather jacket , skirt wearing by figures including Martin Gore of Depeche Mode and the early " dominatrix " image of Annie Lennox of the Eurythmics . In the US this led to British synthpop artists being characterised as " English haircut bands " or " art fag " music . Although some audiences were overtly hostile to synthpop , it achieved an appeal among those alienated from the dominant heterosexuality of mainstream rock culture , particularly among gay and female audiences . 
 = = Influence = = 
 By the mid @-@ 1980s , synthpop had helped establish the synthesizer as a primary instrument in mainstream pop music . It also influenced the sound of many mainstream rock acts , such as Bruce Springsteen , ZZ Top and Van Halen . It was a major influence on house music , which grew out of the post @-@ disco dance club culture of the early 1980s as some DJs attempted to make the less pop @-@ oriented music that also incorporated influences from Latin soul , dub , rap music , and jazz . 
 Musicians such as Juan Atkins , using names including Model 500 , Infinity and as part of <unk> , developed a style of electronic dance music influenced by synthpop and funk that led to the emergence of Detroit techno in the mid @-@ 1980s . The continued influence of 1980s synthpop could be seen in various incarnations of 1990s dance music including trance . Hip hop artists such as Mobb Deep have sampled 1980s synthpop songs . Popular artists such as Rihanna , UK stars Jay Sean and Taio Cruz , as well as British pop star Lily Allen on her second album , have also embraced the genre .

 Interstate 8 ( I @-@ 8 ) is an Interstate Highway in the southwestern United States . It runs from the southern edge of Mission Bay at Sunset Cliffs Boulevard , in San Diego , California , almost at the Pacific Ocean , to the junction with I @-@ 10 , just southeast of Casa Grande , Arizona . In California , the freeway travels through the San Diego metropolitan area as the Ocean Beach Freeway and the Mission Valley Freeway before traversing the Cuyamaca Mountains and providing access through the Imperial Valley , including the city of El Centro . Crossing the Colorado River into Arizona , I @-@ 8 continues through the city of Yuma across the Sonoran Desert to Casa Grande , in between the cities of Phoenix and Tucson . 
 The first route over the Cuyamaca Mountains was dedicated in 1912 , and a plank road served as the first road across the Imperial Valley to Yuma ; east of there , the Gila Trail continued east to Gila Bend . These were later replaced by U.S. Route 80 ( US 80 ) across California and part of Arizona , and Arizona State Route 84 ( SR 84 ) between Gila Bend and Casa Grande . The US 80 freeway through San Diego was largely complete by the time it was renumbered as I @-@ 8 in the 1964 state highway renumbering ; east of San Diego , the US 80 roadway was slowly replaced by I @-@ 8 as construction progressed in the Imperial Valley . The Arizona portion of the road was built starting in the 1960s . Several controversies erupted during the construction process ; questionable labor practices in Imperial County led to the federal conviction of mobster Jimmy Fratianno , and the Arizona government was found to have mismanaged financial resources by the U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee . 
 The route was completed in 1975 through California , and by 1977 through Arizona , though the bridge over the Colorado River was not completed until 1978 . Since then , the freeway through San Diego has been widened due to increasing congestion , and another portion in Imperial County had to be rebuilt following Tropical Storm Kathleen . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 8 is part of the National Highway System , a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . The freeway from the eastern junction with California State Route 98 ( SR 98 ) to the eastern end is designated as part of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail auto tour route , promoted by the National Park Service . 
 = = = San Diego to Arizona border = = = 
 The freeway begins at the intersection of Sunset Cliffs Boulevard and Nimitz Boulevard in San Diego . For its first few miles , it parallels the San Diego River floodway . Near Old Town San Diego , I @-@ 8 intersects with I @-@ 5 as well as with Rosecrans Avenue , the former routing of SR 209 . As the freeway enters Mission Valley , it continues eastward , bisecting the area known as " Hotel Circle " that has several hotels . I @-@ 8 then has interchanges with SR 163 , I @-@ 805 , and I @-@ 15 and its continuation , SR 15 , before making a small bend to the north . In La Mesa , the route intersects SR 125 . I @-@ 8 continues into El Cajon , where it intersects with SR 67 before it ascends into the mountains and the Cleveland National Forest , traveling through towns such as Alpine and Pine Valley , and passing near the Viejas Casino . A U.S. border patrol interior checkpoint was constructed in 1995 near Alpine , for westbound traffic on I @-@ 8 ; however , this resulted in smugglers driving the wrong way on I @-@ 8 at high speeds in order to avoid the checkpoint , causing several accidents , even after concrete barriers were installed . The freeway intersects with SR 79 in the national forest before passing through the La Posta and Campo Indian reservations . In Boulevard , I @-@ 8 has an interchange with the eastern end of SR 94 . 
 I @-@ 8 straddles the San Diego — Imperial county line for a few miles before turning east . At the Mountain Springs / In Ko Pah grade , the freeway is routed down two separate canyons , as it descends 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) in 11 miles ( 18 km ) . In places , the median is over 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) wide . This portion of the road is known for high winds through the canyons that have made driving difficult , sometimes resulting in closure of the freeway ; in 1966 , the California Highway Patrol estimated that winds blew at speeds of up to 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) . The route enters the Imperial Valley , where it intersects with SR 98 , a highway leading to Calexico , and passes near the Desert View Tower . I @-@ 8 then goes through Coyote Wells before entering the city of El Centro several miles later . 
 In El Centro , I @-@ 8 intersects with SR 86 and SR 111 , both north – south routes which connect to I @-@ 10 in the Coachella Valley , north of the Salton Sea . SR 115 and SR 98 end at I @-@ 8 east of El Centro . The route also has the lowest above @-@ ground elevation of any Interstate at 52 feet ( 16 m ) below sea level near El Centro . The freeway then traverses the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area and intersects with SR 186 leading south to Baja California Norte , Mexico . I @-@ 8 runs parallel to the All @-@ American Canal across the desert for roughly 55 miles ( 89 km ) . At points in eastern Imperial County , the Mexican border is less than half a mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) south of the Interstate . I @-@ 8 then passes through Felicity and Winterhaven before crossing the Colorado River on a bridge into Yuma , Arizona . 
 I @-@ 8 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System from I @-@ 5 to the western junction of SR 98 , though it is not an official state scenic highway . It is officially known as the Border Friendship Route from San Diego to the Arizona state line . The Interstate is also signed as the Ocean Beach Freeway west of I @-@ 5 , and as the Kumeyaay Highway , after the local Native American tribe , for the entire length within San Diego County . Between Old Town and El Cajon , I @-@ 8 is called the Mission Valley Freeway . In 2013 , I @-@ 8 had an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) of 11 @,@ 400 between Bonds Corner Road and SR 115 , and 234 @,@ 000 between I @-@ 805 and I @-@ 15 , the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway in California . 
 = = = Yuma to Casa Grande = = = 
 I @-@ 8 enters Arizona from California at the Colorado River bridge at Yuma . It initially heads south through Yuma until the interchange with US 95 , where the freeway begins to turn to the east and passes through eastern Yuma and Fortuna Foothills , briefly paralleling US 95 . West of <unk> , the highway takes a northeasterly course , paralleling the Gila River and passing to the south of Roll . Through this part of Arizona , I @-@ 8 passes along the northern edge of the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range and to the south of the Yuma Proving Ground . It keeps a northeastern heading , passing through the community of <unk> , until it reaches Gila Bend . There , the freeway intersects SR 85 heading north to Phoenix and south to the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument . 
 After leaving Gila Bend , I @-@ 8 takes a southeastern course as it passes through the Sonoran Desert National Monument . Exiting the national monument grounds , the highway continues on an easterly bearing to a junction with SR 84 , a highway that parallels I @-@ 8 to the north and goes through Casa Grande , while I @-@ 8 passes to the south of both Stanfield and Casa Grande . I @-@ 8 reaches its eastern terminus southeast of Casa Grande Mountain Park at an interchange with I @-@ 10 , which continues south to Tucson , and north to Phoenix . 
 The combination of SR 85 between I @-@ 10 and I @-@ 8 as well as I @-@ 8 between SR 85 and I @-@ 10 in Casa Grande has been promoted as a bypass of the Phoenix area for long @-@ distance travelers on I @-@ 10 . In 2013 , I @-@ 8 had an AADT of 5 @,@ 100 between Butterfield Trail and Freeman Road , and 41 @,@ 400 between SR 280 and Araby Road east of Yuma , the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway in Arizona . In the early 2010s , I @-@ 8 from Casa Grande to Gila Bend was sometimes used for smuggling both drugs and humans .

 The I @-@ 8 designation was accepted as a chargeable Interstate by the American Association of State Highway Officials in 1957 , and was added to the state highway system in 1964 by the California State Legislature ; the US 80 designation was removed at that time .

 The freeway that would become I @-@ 8 was constructed in the mid @-@ 20th century through the San Diego area . The section west of I @-@ 5 was originally part of SR 109 , and was added to I @-@ 8 in 1972 . In later years , Caltrans made efforts to widen the freeway as congestion increased . 
 = = = = Initial construction = = = = 
 Much of Alvarado Canyon Road from San Diego to La Mesa was originally built between 1947 and 1950 , a bypass of the old US 80 routing along El Cajon Boulevard and La Mesa Boulevard . Work began to convert the original US 80 divided highway into a freeway in 1960 , and the freeway was complete west of El Cajon by April 1962 . Priority was given to planning US 80 in 1962 by the California Chamber of Commerce . In 1964 , I @-@ 8 was officially designated by the California State Legislature , and the US 80 designation was removed . By 1965 , I @-@ 8 from Fairmount Avenue to El Cajon Boulevard was one of the first freeway stretches in the county to have a center barrier installed in the median . 
 The Ocean Beach Freeway section west of I @-@ 5 was authorized as Route 286 in 1959 . In 1962 , four alternate routes were proposed for this part of the freeway , and for Rosecrans Street . Route 286 was renumbered to SR 109 in the 1964 renumbering . Plans for the Old Town interchange between I @-@ 5 ( formerly US 101 ) , I @-@ 8 ( formerly US 80 ) , SR 209 ( Rosecrans Street ) , and SR 109 date from 1962 , although several concerns had to be taken into account , including the preservation of historical Old Town and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction . The goal was to begin the process in 1966 , and complete the interchange in 1969 . There were concerns about a $ 3 million shortfall in funding ( about $ 40 million in 2015 dollars ) during May 1966 , which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project . This was projected to be the final highway project before I @-@ 5 was completed in San Diego County . 
 The building phase started on September 22 , 1966 , on the interchange that was to replace the intersection of Pacific Highway and Rosecrans Street . The cost of the interchange was projected to be $ 10 @.@ 86 million ( about $ 140 million in 2015 dollars ) . SR 109 was planned to follow Camino del Rio up to the Frontier traffic circle , where the city of San Diego would resume construction ; both SR 109 and SR 209 were to be built in the future . The eight @-@ lane freeway was projected to relieve traffic in the Frontier Street area coming from the San Diego Sports Arena . Bidding for the SR 109 contract was to begin in 1968 , after the City Council endorsed the route in December 1967 . Completion of both the interchange and SR 109 was planned for early 1969 . An interchange was planned at Midway Drive , and the western end of the freeway was to be at Sunset Cliffs and Nimitz boulevards . The cost of the SR 109 project was estimated to be $ 2 @.@ 3 million ( about $ 27 million in 2015 dollars ) . 
 The ramp from south I @-@ 5 to Camino del Rio opened in February 1968 , and a second ramp from southbound I @-@ 5 to eastbound I @-@ 8 opened in August 1968 , with the remainder of the project to be completed in summer 1969 . The groundbreaking for the Ocean Beach Freeway took place on September 23 , 1968 , with the estimated completion to take place within 15 months . However , rain in February 1969 delayed many construction projects across the county , including the SR 109 extension . The entire project was completed in September , with the road scheduled to open in October . The routing of SR 109 was officially added to I @-@ 8 in 1972 .

 Even before the freeway was complete in California , bidding began in 1964 on widening I @-@ 8 from six to eight lanes between near Fairmount Avenue and Spring Street , in San Diego and La Mesa . Three years later , a contract was granted for the widening of the Fairmount Avenue to Ward Road stretch , adding two lanes to the freeway . In 1974 , the San Diego City Council reached an agreement with state officials to improve I @-@ 8 from east of Pacific Highway to Texas Street , over the objections of Councilman Floyd Morrow , who objected to solving traffic issues by continuing to expand freeways . The cost was estimated to be $ 8 million ( about $ 62 million in 2015 dollars ) . 
 The La Mesa City Council asked the state to modify the interchange with SR 125 in 1974 ; the original interchange did not allow for access to SR 125 from I @-@ 8 east or to I @-@ 8 west from SR 125 . Widening of the portion from SR 125 to El Cajon Boulevard to five lanes in each direction was under way in October . By 1981 , the environmental impact report had been completed , and the $ 50 million ( about $ 200 million in 2015 dollars ) project to add ramps and widen I @-@ 8 was awaiting clearance from the Federal Highway Administration . Additional ramps to SR 67 were nearing completion in May 1985 , and were completed to I @-@ 15 north in October . In 1986 , the project revamping the SR 125 interchange was under way , at a cost of $ 80 million ( about $ 234 million in 2015 dollars ) ; it would add two more lanes to I @-@ 8 from Jackson Drive to Fuerte Drive , and allow for SR 125 to be extended north past I @-@ 8 . 
 By 1977 , traffic had reached 172 @,@ 300 vehicles a day , which had increased by nearly 10 percent over the previous year . It was hoped that the construction of SR 52 would help to reduce the congestion . A revised Mission Gorge Road eastbound exit opened in 1979 , merging with traffic from I @-@ 15 . Traffic reached 212 @,@ 000 vehicles a day by February 1981 , and Caltrans declared I @-@ 8 east of I @-@ 805 the busiest highway in the region . In 1987 , Caltrans determined that I @-@ 8 west between College Avenue and Waring Road had the highest ratio of cars to number of lanes worldwide , at 2400 cars per hour . Plans to add another lane to I @-@ 8 west from College Avenue to I @-@ 15 began in March 1992 . 
 Caltrans proposed the installation of a metered traffic signal on I @-@ 8 west in Lakeside during 1987 , in order to improve traffic flow in the mornings by inserting a short delay before entering San Diego should the rate exceed 2 @,@ 000 vehicles per hour . However , the state put its plans on hold shortly thereafter , following several concerns from the public , and from state senator Jim Ellis .

 A stagecoach road existed into the 19th century that passed through the mountains east of San Diego . Before the freeway was constructed , the automobile road through the mountains east of San Diego was narrow and wound through the mountains ; it was officially dedicated in 1912 . This trip was known to take up to four hours , and frequently resulted in the radiator boiling over , flat tires , or broken fan belts ; inclement weather would result in cars becoming mired in the mud . The road was paved in 1926 , and was open by 1927 ; remnants of this road were still present in the late twentieth century . Another road was built in the early 1930s , to remove curves and widen the lanes . This was a two @-@ lane road that still had many switchbacks , with one popularly known as " Dead Man 's Curve " . Construction of I @-@ 8 took place atop much of the roadbed of the highway from the early 1930s . The delay in extending a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California , according to the San Diego Union .

 Completion of the freeway was the second highest priority according to the Highway Development Association in May 1963 , after the I @-@ 5 freeway . Bidding began on the portion from Broadway in El Cajon to Harritt Road in September 1963 . This section of the freeway was to parallel US 80 to the south up to Lakeview Road , and then to the north . This portion of the freeway was scheduled to be complete by May 1965 . By January 1965 , I @-@ 8 had been completed from I @-@ 5 east to an interchange with Lake Jennings Park Road , just south of the latter 's intersection with the southern terminus of Harritt Road . The part of the freeway from west of Harritt Road to west of Alpine was up for bidding in October 1964 , and the Highway Commission set aside $ 2 @.@ 1 million ( about $ 33 million in 2015 dollars ) for this 1 @.@ 6 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 2 @.@ 6 km ) stretch in February 1965 . A contract for $ 1 @.@ 42 million ( about $ 21 million in 2015 dollars ) was issued in August 1965 . The entire six @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) stretch from Lake Jennings Road to Harbinson Canyon Road was under construction by September 1965 and was scheduled to be complete by the next year . 
 In the Mountain Springs pass between San Diego and Imperial counties , the eastbound lanes traverse the pass on the former roadbed of US 80 near Myers Creek . The westbound lanes were placed on a different routing through Devil 's Canyon that had been constructed by November 1963 . A contract for paving the 9 @.@ 7 miles ( 15 @.@ 6 km ) from the San Diego – Imperial county line to SR 98 , including the eastbound lanes , was given to the Isbell Construction Company for $ 3 @.@ 69 million ( about $ 61 million in 2015 dollars ) in May 1963 . This portion was completed in May 1965 " through some of the most rugged , hottest sections of San Diego and Imperial counties , " according to the San Diego Union . Construction ran into difficulties following concerns regarding potential landslides . The westbound lanes were built first , and temporarily contained both directions of traffic while the old highway was converted into the eastbound lanes . The Los Angeles Times described the stretch east of Mountain Springs as follows : " Through it the freeway engineers have hacked two separate roadways night even in sight of each other , but so overpowering in the sheer magnitude of the cuts through the mountains that it is almost impossible to believe human beings could have so overpowered hostile nature ... " While using nuclear explosions to conduct blasting operations in the Laguna Mountains was considered as a possibility , the proposal was not considered to be practical at the time . Two cables and a hook were used to move girders into place ; this was the first use of a cable in Southern California road construction . 
 The portion from Boulevard to near the Imperial County line was included in the California Highway Commission budget for 1965 – 1966 . A 6 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 10 @.@ 8 km ) extension from Mountain Springs west to what was then known as Road J @-@ 35 was given $ 3 @.@ 3 million ( about $ 48 million in 2015 dollars ) in funding by the Highway Commission in May 1965 . The 10 @-@ mile ( 16 km ) section in between this one and the Mountain Springs pass section was in planning by that September , and was scheduled to begin the building phase shortly thereafter , with the section extending west of Boulevard to follow . That section , from Crestwood to Boulevard , was to begin construction soon after the $ 3 million ( about $ 40 million in 2015 dollars ) contract was given out in January 1966 . The coming of the freeway from both west and east of Jacumba was projected to be a significant event in the history of the town . Cafes and gas stations went out of business once the freeway bypassed the town ; however , many retired adults relocated into the town since the high traffic levels were gone . The labeling of the town Boulevard as Manzanita on I @-@ 8 signs raised controversy and forced the Division of Highways to obscure the name on the signs until the issue was resolved . 
 Construction continued with the issuing of a $ 6 @.@ 55 million contract ( about $ 84 million in 2015 dollars ) to widen a 5 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 2 km ) section of I @-@ 8 through Alpine , from Harbinson Canyon to east of West Victoria Drive , and to begin construction in April or May 1967 , to be completed in 1969 . This would leave only a 30 @-@ mile ( 48 km ) stretch of I @-@ 8 that was not at freeway standards . As the process continued , concerns about increased smog from the additional traffic were raised in October 1967 . A 3 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 0 km ) section to the east of Alpine was scheduled to have bidding opened in November of that year , and was to be finished in 1968 ; this would produce a continuous freeway from San Diego to the eastern terminus of this route . Both of these projects were underway by May 1968 . An additional contract was given out for $ 7 @.@ 8 million ( about $ 93 million in 2015 dollars ) in August to continue the freeway east from Alpine Street to Japatul Valley Road ; this would bring the freeway near Descanso Junction . Roughly 5 @.@ 5 million cubic yards of dirt and rock were to be generated by all three of these construction projects , since half of a mountain would have to be removed with a million pounds of dynamite . The third project was built near the site of an abandoned attempt to build a tunnel for the old highway after World War II , which proved to be too expensive . 
 By mid @-@ February 1969 , one segment of the freeway running through Alpine was nearing completion and was scheduled to open on February 21 ; another section was scheduled to open in April . However , although dirt and rocks were transported on a conveyor belt across US 80 to become part of an embankment for the Sweetwater River bridge , the grading of the mountain near Viejas Grade and the Sweetwater River had not been completed on the final link . The historic Ellis Grade radiator stop was to be removed and replaced with one at Vista Point . On April 19 , 1969 , the part 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) east of Alpine opened to traffic . All of the Alpine part of I @-@ 8 opened on May 22 , 1969 , after a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony ; yet the Viejas Grade segment was now projected to be completed by 1972 . The bridge over the Sweetwater River was under construction by 1970 , and the entire segment cost $ 22 @.@ 1 million ( about $ 235 million in 2015 dollars ) . By May , this segment was estimated to be completed in the later part of that year . The leveling of the grade resulted in the second highest fill in the state at 360 feet ( 110 m ) .

 The final portion of I @-@ 8 in California , between Japatul Valley Road and west of Boulevard , was prioritized in the 1969 – 1970 state budget . Due to financial concerns , it was announced in September 1968 that the target date for completing the Interstate Highway System would be extended until 1974 , from 1972 . The missing portion of I @-@ 8 was expected to cost $ 45 million and be constructed in three parts , with one part being started each year . The segments between Japatul Valley Road and west of Laguna Junction , and from La Posta Road to west of Boulevard , were delayed for an entire year at the end of 1969 due to a nationwide effort to fight inflation by reducing spending . A 6 @.@ 6 @-@ mile ( 10 @.@ 6 km ) segment from Buckman Springs to Crestwood received funding in May 1970 , which would leave only an 8 @-@ mile ( 13 km ) stretch of the freeway uncompleted when built . The drive time from San Diego to El Centro had been reduced to two hours , according to the California Division of Highways . By August 1970 , the remainder of the freeway had been funded , with the part from <unk> Valley Road to Laguna Junction costing $ 22 million ( about $ 234 million in 2015 dollars ) , and the Laguna Junction to Crestwood portion costing $ 15 million ( about $ 159 million in 2015 dollars ) . 
 In May 1971 , El Centro Mayor Alex Gay requested that passing lanes be added to the remaining two @-@ lane part of I @-@ 8 in between El Centro and San Diego due to the frequent traffic jams in between Japatul Valley and Crestwood . At this time , this was the only missing link through the mountains . Bidding took place on the $ 16 @.@ 5 million ( about $ 164 million in 2015 dollars ) La Posta Road to Crestwood Road and the <unk> Valley Road to Sunrise Highway portions in November 1971 . As part of this series of projects , the highest concrete bridge in the state at the time was to be built at 430 feet ( 130 m ) over Pine Valley Creek on the segment between Japatul Valley Road and Sunrise Highway . The contract came in at $ 22 @.@ 6 million ( about $ 206 million in 2015 dollars ) , over $ 5 million ( about $ 46 million in 2015 dollars ) beyond budget due to the difficulty of the bridge construction . All three of the projects to complete I @-@ 8 were projected to be complete by mid @-@ 1974 . However , in March 1972 , it was announced that the La Posta Road portion of the project would be delayed due to budget troubles . 
 By the beginning of 1974 , the new projected completion date for I @-@ 8 was mid @-@ 1975 , with 22 miles ( 35 km ) of two @-@ lane highway remaining . The Pine Valley Creek bridge and the segment extending from <unk> Valley Road to Pine Valley was dedicated on November 24 , 1974 , and was scheduled to open on November 26 ; this left 8 miles ( 13 km ) of freeway to be constructed . The final stretch of I @-@ 8 in California , from Sunrise Highway to La Posta Road , was completed in May 1975 . 
 The Buckman Springs rest area opened in January 1979 in eastern San Diego County . In 1987 , the first 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) speed limit sign was posted east of El Cajon , the first one in the state ; the speed limit on all I @-@ 8 east of El Cajon , except for the Mountain Springs Grade portion , was raised similarly . By 1996 the limit increased to the present 70 .

 The highway through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together . The Ocean @-@ to @-@ Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915 . Following this , US 80 was built through the valley as the main east – west route . Plans for a new freeway across the southernmost reaches of California date from before 1950 . The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956 , at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 2 million , and was in use until 1978 , when the I @-@ 8 bridge was built . In 1957 , the City of El Centro expressed a desire for the new freeway to replace US 80 to be routed along the southern limits of the city . Caltrans engineer Jacob Dekema stated at the time that the four @-@ lane freeway would not be constructed on the US 80 routing due to possible expansion of the Naval Air Facility El Centro . 
 In October 1964 , the portion of I @-@ 8 between Imperial Avenue in El Centro to SR 111 appeared in the state budget . By December , a route for the part of I @-@ 8 just west of the Colorado River was being examined by the California Highway Commission . Construction was underway on the stretch from Seeley to SR 111 by June 1966 , and the entire portion through the county was planned for completion by 1968 . This 12 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 19 @.@ 6 km ) portion , extending west to Drew Road , was planned for completion by early 1967 , at a cost of $ 200 million ( about $ 2 @.@ 57 billion in 2015 dollars ) ; however , by then the date for completion of the freeway had slipped to 1972 . The state ordered the building of the portion from west of Coyote Wells to just east of Drew Road in September 1967 . The next year , Dekema indicated that the goal was to have I @-@ 8 completed by 1973 , citing a deadline in order to have the federal government pay for up to ninety percent of the costs ; the other freeways in the region were to be delayed because of this . 
 In early 1970 , the portion of the freeway from west of Ogilby Road to east of Algodones Road was under construction , and projections were to have this portion completed by later that year . This $ 5 @.@ 2 million ( about $ 55 million in 2015 dollars ) project also included resurfacing the freeway that had already been built through the Colorado Desert Sandhills ; this part of the freeway had been built between 1961 and 1965 . By this time , it was estimated that the drive from San Diego to El Centro now took two hours , as opposed to the three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours required two decades earlier , and the two days required in the pioneer era . This part of the freeway was opened in July 1970 . As the freeway was constructed through the valley , it caused a break in many north – south roads . These breaks were located where access to the part of the road on the other side of the freeway was cut off . Plans were put in place to build frontage roads to improve access through the region . 
 The 16 @-@ mile ( 26 km ) portion of I @-@ 8 bypassing Holtville began construction in December 1969 , and was nearing completion in May 1971 , to result in a continuous freeway that connected two existing segments from Crestwood in San Diego County to just west of Winterhaven . It was estimated that the bypass would save travelers 20 minutes of travel time through the Imperial Valley . The cost of this project was $ 11 @.@ 2 million ( about $ 124 million in 2015 dollars ) . However , Holtville residents raised concerns about SR 115 providing the only access to the eastern part of the city , notably the narrow and curved portion leading from the freeway into town . Work on the Holtville portion began at 3 : 30 a.m. daily during the summer in order to avoid the desert heat . In addition to this , construction of the Highline Canal overpass involved a 120 @-@ foot ( 37 m ) steel span that was prefabricated and made of girders that were hoisted into position by barges . The <unk> Construction Company attempted to set the world record for laying the most concrete in a day , aided by the level terrain , but failed to do so after the concrete mixer malfunctioned . That same year , bids for an Arizona plant inspection station near Winterhaven , next to the California agricultural inspection station , were submitted . 
 The last 6 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 10 @.@ 5 km ) part of the California portion , from near Algodones Road to west of the Arizona state line , was to enter the bidding phase in early 1972 . I @-@ 8 was scheduled to be completed in the summer of 1975 between San Diego and Yuma , although there would be a break in the freeway around Yuma ; this occurred by October 1975 . At the time the California portion was completed , it was the preferred route to Phoenix from some areas of Los Angeles , since I @-@ 10 had not been completed . 
 The missing portion of the highway was the new bridge over the Colorado River , which was built at a cost of $ 7 @.@ 4 million ( about $ 53 million in 2015 dollars ) . In June 1975 , there were concerns regarding the state delaying new construction projects due to financial concerns , and the effects this would have on the bridge . The bid for the project was awarded to Novo @-@ <unk> Construction in October 1975 , as one of the final projects before the construction freeze . The new bridge , which replaced the old US 80 bridge , was dedicated on August 18 , 1978 ; this completed I @-@ 8 from San Diego to Casa Grande . The Arizona Department of Transportation and the City of Yuma assisted in the planning process . By the time the California portion of the freeway was complete , the average cost was $ 1 million per mile ( about $ 5 million in 2015 dollars ) . The bridge opened on September 20 , 1978 . The State of California was responsible for the bridge erection , even though the State of Arizona owned half of the bridge . 
 = = = = Fratianno allegations = = = = 
 Jimmy Fratianno was associated with Frank Bompensiero , the San Diego mafia leader , in a criminal lawsuit involving the Fratianno Trucking Company and the Miles and Sons Trucking Company in 1966 ; he was known to law enforcement as " the Mafia 's West Coast executioner , " with up to 16 deaths that he was potentially responsible for . Both companies were awarded the contracts to transport dirt during the construction of I @-@ 8 in El Centro . Drivers were coerced to agree to buy the trucks , although the Fratianno Company still retained the ownership ; they also had portions of their wages withheld from them . Following this , the drivers were loaned money from Leo <unk> , another mafia leader . An investigation in early 1966 after complaints from the drivers led to state charges against the two firms as well as five people in August . There were concerns that John <unk> , the state director of public works , had a conflict of interest with Fratianno and did not enforce the law ; however , both Transportation Administrator Robert Bradford ( upon a request for investigation from then- ( and now ) Governor Jerry Brown ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation found that there was no conflict of interest . 
 The truck drivers were given $ 36 @,@ 000 ( about $ 463 thousand in 2015 dollars ) in back pay from the state government . Fratianno and Bompensiero were charged with fraud , as well as state labor and public utility code violations . While charges were dropped against Bompensiero , Fratianno was found guilty . The Imperial County Supervisors estimated that $ 25 @,@ 000 ( about $ 6 @.@ 04 million in 2015 dollars ) in damage to county roads took place due to overloaded trucks . The federal government fined him $ 10 @,@ 000 ( about $ 119 thousand in 2015 dollars ) , which he never paid , and placed him on probation for three years ; he was imprisoned when he did not pay , but was released in September 1969 . His ex @-@ wife , Jewell , as well as the company , were fined $ 4 @,@ 014 ( about $ 40 @,@ 000 in 2015 dollars ) individually for their responsibility in the matter . For the state charges , he was sentenced in 1969 to one to three years in prison , after pleading guilty to the charges . He was incarcerated in Chico State Prison following a parole violation until 1973 . 
 = = = = Storm damage = = = = 
 Following Tropical Storm Kathleen in September 1976 , a flood eroded 400 pieces of the roadway from westbound I @-@ 8 near Ocotillo , resulting in the construction of a detour . The freeway reopened to traffic in February 1978 after the damage was repaired and a new bridge was built , at a cost of $ 1 million ( about $ 5 million in 2015 dollars ) . But in 1982 , the freeway was closed again near Ocotillo due to flooding following another storm .

 Between Yuma and Gila Bend , I @-@ 8 runs alongside the routes of both the Gila Trail and the Butterfield Overland Mail Company line . The latter was a stagecoach line that went between Tipton , Missouri and San Francisco , with several stations in between , and was used to transport passengers across the country at five miles per hour ( 8 @.@ 0 km / h ) between 1858 and 1861 . In later years , the Southern Pacific Railroad was constructed , paralleling the Gila River east of Fortuna ; by 1877 , the tracks were complete to Yuma . The next year , work continued , and by 1880 , the tracks were extended to Tucson from Yuma . 
 This portion of the route of I @-@ 8 was originally part of the proposed state system of highways in 1921 . By 1926 , this section became part of the cross @-@ country highway US 80 . The route was not paved at this time , but was a gravel road along the entire corridor . By 1928 , the portion of I @-@ 8 between Gila Bend and Casa Grande was designated as SR 84 . A small portion of the highway was paved near Yuma and SR 84 was under construction by the next year . SR 84 was completed by 1930 , but not paved , and the segment of US 80 between Aztec and Sentinel had been paved . 
 Paving of SR 84 had commenced by 1934 , with the portion of the highway in Maricopa County being paved . A group of San Diego citizens raised concerns about the road from Yuma to Gila Bend not being paved in 1934 , due to the impact that this would have on tourism in San Diego , and made a request to the federal government to have it paved . The entire future corridor of I @-@ 8 had been paved from Yuma to Casa Grande by 1935 . Drivers were told to bring spare fan belts , radiator hoses , and additional drinking water for the journey traversing the desert . A " <unk> Association " began in 1952 to promote SR 84 as a route to bypass Phoenix on the way to San Diego . 
 With the coming of the Interstate Highways , the corridor was to be upgraded to Interstate standards . In late 1958 , a group of motel owners whose properties were located on SR 84 strongly objected to any routing of I @-@ 8 that would not go through the city of Casa Grande . Motel owners in Yuma proposed their own alternative in 1961 to the four routings of I @-@ 8 through the city that had been proposed , raising concerns about losing revenue from tourism . In January 1962 , the alternatives were narrowed down to two , with one of them being the route supported by the motel owners . However , nearby school officials expressed concerns regarding that route , because 1200 students would no longer be able to walk to school if the freeway was constructed along that route . Later that year , a new route had been proposed , along the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks and the Colorado River . By 1963 , work was in progress , with portions of the highway between Mohawk and Gila Bend , and between Gila Bend and near Stanfield upgraded . Other merchants objected to the routing , and met with the Yuma County Board of Supervisors to raise their concerns following the final approval of the route in 1964 . A new park was to be built east of the Colorado River crossing , just opposite downtown ; city officials hoped that this would give an improved look to the town as drivers first arrived . 
 Nevertheless , there was controversy over the work in Arizona as well . In 1964 , a U.S. House of Representatives investigation discovered that poor management and lack of efficiency were prevalent in four of the projects constructing the I @-@ 8 freeway . The Arizona Highway Department was specifically cited in the report for not taking into account protecting government interests when selecting labor for the projects . Several errors were discovered , and one of them , adding too much clay to the gravel mixture , cost the state of Arizona $ 26 @,@ 278 ( about $ 435 thousand in 2015 dollars ) to fix . By that year , construction had begun on the freeway west of Casa Grande , while the rest of the Arizona routing was in the design stages . 
 In 1965 , a $ 1 @.@ 46 million ( about $ 21 million in 2015 dollars ) contract was granted to build the 5 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 2 km ) portion from near Araby Road east through Fortuna Wash . Two years later , it was estimated that construction would be complete by 1969 , except for the Colorado River bridge . The highway was in progress through the Telegraph Pass east of Yuma , and the portions from Avenue 9 @-@ E to 4 @-@ E , from there to 4th Street in Yuma , and to the river were estimated to cost $ 9 @.@ 69 million ( about $ 125 million in 2015 dollars ) in total . Following local complaints , Francis Turner , the executive director of the federal Bureau of Public Roads , agreed to look at constructing an interchange at <unk> Road in Casa Grande again , after an earlier decline to do so . Work began on the Casa Grande part of the freeway in March 1968 , at a cost of $ 3 million ( about $ 36 million in 2015 dollars ) . That year , many gas station , motel , and restaurant owners noticed a drop in business , possibly due to concerns regarding construction traffic due to I @-@ 8 ; however , they hoped for increased business following completion of the freeway . The Yuma County Chamber of Commerce made plans to promote tourism in the town following the completion of I @-@ 8 by late 1968 . 
 Bidding on the last portion of the freeway to be completed in Casa Grande , from Midway Road to I @-@ 10 , was to begin in January 1969 . By November , the freeway east of Yuma was under construction , at a cost of $ 3 @.@ 7 million ( about $ 41 million in 2015 dollars ) . On June 15 , 1970 , eastbound traffic began on I @-@ 8 in Casa Grande , with an exit at both <unk> and Thorton roads , with westbound traffic soon to follow . Businesses did not notice much change with the opening of the eastbound lanes . In 1971 , I @-@ 8 was nearly complete , including a new alignment east of Yuma built parallel and to the south of the original US 80 alignment . A new alignment was also built to the south of the SR 84 alignment at the eastern end of the highway from southwest of Stanfield to the eastern terminus at I @-@ 10 southeast of Casa Grande . The only portions of I @-@ 8 not completed at this time were the Gila Bend bypass and the western end near Yuma . The portion east of 16th Street in Yuma was completed in June 1972 ; the Arizona State Highway Commission authorized the $ 1 @.@ 6 million ( about $ 28 million in 2015 dollars ) contract to construct the six @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) portion through Gila Bend in August . Some Yuma businesses had noticed a decrease in revenue at this time ; the Arizona Highway Department agreed to modify some signs to eliminate any confusion . The part of I @-@ 8 between 16th and 4th streets was under construction in 1976 , which was the only incomplete part of the freeway , along with the bridge over the Colorado River . The water treatment plant in Yuma was to be moved due to the potential of an accident with a vehicle carrying hazardous materials flying off the bridge and contaminating the water supply . The freeway in both states was completed with the opening of the bridge on September 20 , 1978 . 
 As the Interstate was completed , the highways that it replaced were removed from the state highway system . In 1973 , the SR 84 designation was removed from the highway from Gila Bend to the split where I @-@ 8 followed a new alignment southwest of Stanfield . In 1977 , the US 80 designation was removed from this stretch in favor of I @-@ 8 .

 = Stamford Canal = 
 Stamford Canal , now disused , is one of the earliest post @-@ Roman canals in England . It opened in 1670 , around 100 years before the start of the Industrial Revolution which brought about the " golden age " for canals in Britain . Parts of the route can be traced on the ground , though only one lock survives intact . It was part of the Welland Navigation in Lincolnshire . First authorised in 1571 , during the reign of Elizabeth I , construction did not start until 1664 , under powers granted in 1620 and ratified by James I. It ran for 9 @.@ 5 miles ( 15 @.@ 3 km ) from Stamford to Market Deeping and had 12 locks , two of which were on the river section at Deeping St James . No plans of its construction survive , although one of the locks was documented by a visiting water engineer in 1699 . It contributed to the wealth of Stamford , allowing barley to be transported to the town for malting . 
 Plans to link it westwards to the Oakham Canal , northwards to the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain and southwards to the River Nene in 1809 came to nothing , and it closed in 1863 , soon after the arrival of the Midland Railway in the area . Although Stamford Corporation attempted to sell it after closure , its ownership was disputed , and they were unable to do so . Its course and some of its structures can still be traced in the landscape . These include warehouses at the terminus in Stamford , and a weir which regulated water levels on the River Gwash , which it crossed on the level . 
 = = History = = 
 The River Welland was one of the earlier on which improvements , in this case to allow navigation to Stamford , were authorised by an act of Parliament . The act was granted in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in 1571 , and the preamble explained how Stamford had prospered as a result of the river , but also stated that mills built between Stamford and Deeping had resulted in it no longer being navigable , as they had diverted the water . Powers were granted to restore the river using either the old channel or the new one , although it is not clear exactly what was meant by this . There is no evidence that any work was carried out under the terms of the act . 
 However , the powers were revived in 1620 , when Stamford Corporation was given permission by the Commission of Sewers to build a new artificial cut , which would run from the eastern edge of Stamford near Hudd 's Mill , to Market Deeping , where it would rejoin the river . The corporation estimated that it would cost £ 2 @,@ 000 to carry out the work , and the act enabled them to charge tolls for its use , set initially at three pence ( 1 @.@ 25 p ) per lock , which could be charged once the work was completed . The decision was ratified in 1623 by a grant of James I , and the corporation expected to have the work completed by 1627 . However , they were unable to find a suitable contractor to carry out the work , and failed to reach agreement on terms with David Cecil in 1636 , and two other potential contractors after that . Nothing happened until 1664 , when an Alderman from Stamford called Daniel Wigmore took the job . He built the cut and 12 locks , which included the High Lock and the Low Lock on the river at Deeping St James , at a cost of £ 5 @,@ 000 . In return for his expenditure , he was given the lease of the tolls for the next 80 years , for which he paid a rent of one shilling ( five pence ) . The cut was the longest canal with locks in the country , when it was opened in 1670 . Its construction preceded the ' canal age ' by around 100 years , making it one of England 's earliest post @-@ Roman canals . 
 There are no known contemporary documents describing the design or methods of construction of the canal and nothing about its opening . However , a report from 1632 on alterations to the river noted that 600 men were involved in the work , so presumably there was sufficient labour locally for such tasks . Wigmore probably used handbills at local inns to recruit his workers , since there were no newspapers to carry advertisements . The work would have been done using pickaxes , shovels and wheelbarrows . The excavated ditch was then lined with blue clay to make it watertight . Excavations for a sewer in 1974 and work on a rubbish tip in 1979 revealed the layers of blue clay , and there were clay pits near Stamford , which supported a pottery industry , although their precise location is unknown . 
 The canal enabled goods to reach Stamford from The Wash , which was 34 miles ( 55 km ) away , by way of Spalding and Crowland . The lower 24 @.@ 4 miles ( 39 @.@ 3 km ) used the course of the Welland , after which the two river locks and weirs at Deeping St James were encountered . Beyond Market Deeping , the course consisted of an artificial cut with 10 more locks , by which it reached the eastern edge of Stamford , after which it rejoined the river to reach the town wharf . The length of the cut was 6 @.@ 5 miles ( 10 @.@ 5 km ) , although the length of the canal is usually quoted as 9 @.@ 5 miles ( 15 @.@ 3 km ) , to include the improved river sections at both ends . Just below Stamford , the canal crossed the River Gwash on the level . There was a weir on a bypass channel and a sluice on the main river channel , which enabled the river levels to be controlled , so that barges could cross . 
 = = = Operation = = = 
 Trade thrived , for Richard <unk> recorded the prosperous Stamford malt trade in 1673 , which depended on barley being carried by boat . With the death of Daniel Wigmore , his son @-@ in @-@ law Charles Halford became the owner of the toll rights . In 1695 , he was receiving between £ 400 and £ 500 per year , most of it derived from the carriage of sea coal . The trade amounted to 3 @,@ 000 chaldrons that year , and he tried to get the tax on sea coal , which Parliament had approved , reversed . He did not succeed , and failed again in 1706 , by which time he stated that the tax had decreased the amount of coal carried to just 500 chaldrons . Besides coal , the canal carried malt and agricultural produce , groceries , timber , slate and stone . Boats used on the canal were small lighters , 35 feet ( 11 m ) long by around 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) wide , capable of carrying from seven to fourteen tons , and normally worked in trains of four vessels . 
 Although there are no known records from the time the canal was constructed , the lock at Hudd 's Mill was documented by Thomas <unk> in 1699 . <unk> was a water engineer , and made notes and drawings when he visited it , during a journey from London to York . The lock chamber was 86 feet ( 26 @.@ 2 m ) long and 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) wide . The gates were hung on stone piers , but the banks between them were of earth . The gates were conventional ' V ' gates , similar to modern ones , which included some sort of paddle , but did not include balance beams . Instead , a chain or rope was attached to the mid @-@ stream edge of the gate and to the bank . While this would have made opening the gates possible , it is not obvious how they were shut . The measurements match those of the surviving structures , with the exception of <unk> 's lock , which appears to only be 56 feet ( 17 m ) long . There is no visible evidence that it was shortened at some point , nor any obvious reason why it would have been built shorter than all the others . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 When the Melton Mowbray Navigation was being planned in 1785 , there were discussions of a link to Oakham , which eventually became the Oakham Canal , and onwards to Stamford . The idea of a canal from Stamford to Oakham , 11 miles ( 18 km ) due west , was revived in 1809 , with plans for a 7 @-@ mile ( 11 km ) link from Stamford to the Nene at Peterborough , and a connection from near Market Deeping northwards to the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain , from where Boston could be reached . A bill for this , together with one for a rival scheme to link Stamford to the Grand Junction Canal , which also included a connection to the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain , were put before Parliament in 1811 , but neither met with any success . The idea was raised again in 1815 and 1828 , but no further action was taken . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 With the arrival of the railways , river trade declined . The Midland Railway reached Peterborough in 1846 , and opened their line to Melton Mowbray , passing through Stamford , in 1848 . Carriage of coal on the canal stopped , as the railways brought cheaper coal from the Midlands . The locks quickly deteriorated , and there were problems with leakage . By April 1863 , all traffic had ceased , and Stamford Corporation tried to sell the line at auction , but failed because their ownership of it was disputed . 
 Since its closure , the canal has largely disappeared but some parts are still viewable on maps and on the ground . The foundations of the two river locks are visible in the Deepings . 
 The River Welland is currently only navigable to Crowland but plans for the Fens Waterways Link include a new link from above Crowland to above the Dog in a <unk> sluice on the River Nene . There are currently no plans to restore navigation to Stamford . The Dog in a <unk> sluice near Peterborough was built in 1937 ; the Nene is tidal below it .

 Stamford Wharf was the upper limit of navigation , and was situated below Town Bridge , which carries the <unk> road over the river at Stamford . There were buildings associated with the canal on both sides of the river , including a large warehouse next to the bridge , parts of which date from 1671 , and which is Grade II listed . Barges followed the river down past the ruins of St Leonard 's Priory , established in 1090 by the Benedictines , to <unk> Mill , where the cut began , on the north side of the mill . <unk> Mill Lock was almost at the start of the cut . The canal flowed initially to the east , but turned to the north east to cross the River Gwash at right angles . It then entered Uffington Park , where the remains of the weir that regulated river levels at the crossing can still be seen . The Gwash now has much less flow than it did when the canal was active , since the construction of the reservoir at Rutland Water further upstream . The earthworks of the canal continue through the park . 
 The route of the canal is just to the north of the river , and a public footpath follows it through Uffington Park until it reaches the Uffington to Barnack road . The adjacent bridge over the River Welland has three arches and dates from the seventeenth century but the canal bridge has been filled in to protect its structure . There were three locks in open countryside on this section before the canal reached Tallington where Tallington Village Lock was located just to the north of St Lawrence Church , parts of which date from the 12th to 15th centuries , with later additions . Remains of bridge piers were uncovered during archaeological excavations carried out in 1998 when a water pipeline running from Tallington to West Deeping was installed . No details of the bridge have survived , but the levels suggest that it was probably a movable bridge . The canal then passed close to Tallington Mill , a water mill dating from around 1700 , to reach Horse Holmes Lock . A railway line crossed the tail of the lock , but after the demise of the canal , the line was widened , and the lock is thought to be buried beneath the embankment . 
 The canal then looped around the northern edge of Horse Marsh to reach West Deeping , where there was another lock . There are visible remains of this lock , indicating that it had stone piers at both ends to support the gates , with turf sides between them . It then crossed King Street . An enclosure map dating from 1810 shows that the road crossed the canal by a ford , but that there was also a footbridge to allow pedestrians to cross the canal without getting wet . From West Deeping to Market Deeping , the canal was close to the northern bank of the northern river channel . There were two more locks in open countryside , and another at the western edge of the town , after which the cut rejoined the river . The final two locks were built on the River Welland , <unk> Lock in Deeping St James , and Low Lock to the south @-@ east of the village .

 = Marietta @-@ class monitor = 
 The Marietta class monitors were a pair of ironclad river monitors laid down in the summer of 1862 for the United States Navy during the American Civil War . Construction was slow , partially for lack of labor , and the ships were not completed until December 1865 , after the war was over . However the navy did not accept them until 1866 and immediately laid them up . They were sold in 1873 without ever having been commissioned . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Marietta @-@ class monitors were part of a large program of armored ships ordered after the Battle of Hampton Roads caused the navy to favor monitors over the previous casemate ironclads of the City class . They were built to gain control of the Mississippi River and its many tributaries . 
 The original plans for the Marietta @-@ class ships resembled the river monitor USS Ozark in many ways . The gun turret was at the bow and they had a deckhouse aft . There were also twin smokestacks similar to the Mississippi River steamboat designs . The original plans also called for a forward , pyramidal pilothouse , similar to the one on USS Monitor , however it is believed that the pilothouse was moved to the top of the turret before construction was completed . The Marietta class ships were 177 feet ( 53 @.@ 9 m ) long overall . They had a beam of 50 feet ( 15 @.@ 2 m ) and a draft of 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) . They displaced 479 long tons ( 487 t ) . The ships had four steam boilers powering two western steamboat @-@ type engines that drove a single propeller . The Marietta @-@ class ships had a maximum speed of 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) and they carried a maximum of 150 long tons ( 150 t ) of coal . 
 The ships ' main armament consisted of two smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) Dahlgren guns mounted in a single gun turret . Each gun weighed approximately 16 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 300 kg ) . They could fire a 136 @-@ pound ( 61 @.@ 7 kg ) shell up to a range of 3 @,@ 650 yards ( 3 @,@ 340 m ) at an elevation of 15 ° . The turret and the pilothouse were protected by 6 inches ( 152 mm ) of wrought iron armor while the deck and hull had 1 @.@ 25 inches ( 32 mm ) of armor .

 The contract for the two ships was awarded to Tomlinson and <unk> Co. on 16 May 1862 . Construction was at their yard in Pittsburgh , PA . Progress was slow , delayed by labor shortages and changes by the navy . The US government allocated $ 188 @,@ 000 each for the construction of the Marietta and Sandusky , but the final cost rose to $ 235 @,@ 039 after charges for extra work .

 = Benedict Arnold 's expedition to Quebec = 
 In September 1775 , early in the American Revolutionary War , Colonel Benedict Arnold led a force of 1 @,@ 100 Continental Army troops on an expedition from Cambridge , Massachusetts to the gates of Quebec City . Part of a two @-@ pronged invasion of the British Province of Quebec , his expedition passed through the wilderness of what is now Maine . The other expedition , led by Richard Montgomery , invaded Quebec from Lake Champlain . 
 Unanticipated problems beset the expedition as soon as it left the last significant colonial outposts in Maine . The portages up the Kennebec River proved grueling , and the boats frequently leaked , ruining gunpowder and spoiling food supplies . More than a third of the men turned back before reaching the height of land between the Kennebec and Chaudière rivers . The areas on either side of the height of land were swampy tangles of lakes and streams , and the traversal was made more difficult by bad weather and inaccurate maps . Many of the troops lacked experience handling boats in white water , which led to the destruction of more boats and supplies in the descent to the Saint Lawrence River via the fast @-@ flowing Chaudière . 
 By the time Arnold reached the French settlements above the Saint Lawrence River in November , his force was reduced to 600 starving men . They had traveled about 350 miles ( 560 km ) through poorly charted wilderness , twice the distance they had expected to cover . Assisted by the local French @-@ speaking Canadiens , Arnold 's troops crossed the Saint Lawrence on November 13 and 14 and attempted to put Quebec City under siege . Failing in this , they withdrew to Point @-@ aux @-@ Trembles until Montgomery arrived to lead an unsuccessful attack on the city . Arnold was rewarded for his effort in leading the expedition with a promotion to brigadier general . 
 Arnold 's route through northern Maine has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Arnold Trail to Quebec , and some geographic features in the area bear names of expedition participants . 
 = = Background = = 
 On May 10 , 1775 , shortly after the American Revolutionary War began , Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen led an expedition that captured Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain in the British Province of New York . Allen and Arnold were aware that Quebec was lightly defended ; there were only about 600 regular troops in the entire province . Arnold , who had done business in the province before the war , also had intelligence that the French @-@ speaking Canadiens would be favorably disposed toward a colonial force . 
 Arnold and Allen each made arguments to the Second Continental Congress that Quebec could and should be taken from the British , pointing out that the British could use Quebec as a staging area for attacks down Lake Champlain and into the Hudson River valley . Congress did not want to alarm the people of Quebec , and rejected these arguments . In July 1775 , amid concerns that the British might use Quebec as a base for military movements into New York , they changed their position , and authorized an invasion of Quebec via Lake Champlain , assigning the task to Major General Philip Schuyler of New York . 
 = = Planning = = 
 Arnold , who had hoped to lead the invasion , decided to pursue a different approach to Quebec . He went to Cambridge , Massachusetts in early August 1775 , and approached George Washington with the idea of a second eastern invasion force aimed at Quebec City . Washington approved of the idea in principle , but sent a message to General Schuyler on August 20 to ensure his support of the endeavor , since the two forces would need to coordinate their efforts . 
 Arnold 's plan called for the expedition to sail from Newburyport , Massachusetts along the coast and then up the Kennebec River to Fort Western ( now Augusta , Maine ) . From there , they would use shallow @-@ draft river boats called bateaux to continue up the Kennebec River , cross the height of land to Lake Mégantic , and descend the Chaudière River to Quebec . Arnold expected to cover the 180 miles ( 290 km ) from Fort Western to Quebec in 20 days , despite the fact that little was known about the route . Arnold had acquired a map ( copy pictured at left ) and journal made by British military engineer John Montresor in 1760 and 1761 , but Montresor 's descriptions of the route were not very detailed , and Arnold did not know that the map contained some inaccuracies or that some details had been deliberately removed or obscured . 
 Washington introduced Arnold to Reuben Colburn , a boat builder from <unk> , Maine , who was in Cambridge at the time . Colburn offered his services , and Arnold requested detailed information about the route , including potential British naval threats , Indian sentiment , useful supply opportunities , and an estimate of how long it would take to construct bateaux sufficient for the contemplated force . Colburn left for Maine on August 21 to fulfill these requests . Colburn asked Samuel Goodwin , the local surveyor in <unk> , to provide maps for Arnold . Goodwin , who was known to have Loyalist sympathies , provided maps that were inaccurate in the routes , distances and other important features they described . 
 On September 2 , Washington received a letter from General Schuyler in reply to his August 20 message . Schuyler agreed with the suggested plan , and Washington and Arnold immediately began to raise troops and place orders for supplies . 
 = = Recruitment and preparations for departure = = 
 Because there had been little direct action at Boston after the Battle of Bunker Hill in June , many units stationed in the American camps besieging the town were bored with garrison life and eager for action . Arnold selected a force of 750 men from the large number who expressed interest in the proposed expedition . Most of these were divided into two battalions : one commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Roger Enos and the other by Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Greene . The rest were placed in a third battalion under Daniel Morgan that included three companies — 250 men — of Continental riflemen from Virginia and the Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment . These frontiersmen , from the Virginia and Pennsylvania wilderness , were better suited to wilderness combat than to a siege , and had been causing trouble since arriving outside Boston . The entire force numbered about 1 @,@ 100 . Among the volunteers were other men who rose to later prominence during and after the war , including Aaron Burr , Return J. Meigs , Henry Dearborn , and John Joseph Henry . 
 Washington and Arnold were concerned about Indian support for ( or opposition to ) the effort , as well as the reception Arnold 's forces might receive from the Canadians once they arrived near the Saint Lawrence River . On August 30 , Washington wrote to General Schuyler of a meeting he held with an Abenaki chief , " [ The chief ] says the Indians of Canada in general , and also the French , are greatly in our favor , and determined not to act against us . " Four Abenakis accompanied the expedition as scouts and guides . 
 = = Cambridge to Fort Western = = 
 On September 2 , as soon as General Schuyler 's agreement with the expedition was known , Arnold wrote a letter to Nathaniel Tracy , a merchant of his acquaintance in Newburyport . He asked Tracy to acquire sufficient shipping to transport the expedition to Maine without drawing attention to Royal Navy ships patrolling the area . The sea voyage was viewed by both Arnold and Washington as the most dangerous part of the expedition , because British patrols were highly effective at interfering with colonial shipping at the time . 
 The expedition began its departure from Cambridge on September 11 , marching to Newburyport . The first units to leave were composed largely of men from that area , to whom Arnold had given extra time so that they would be able to see their families once more before the expedition left Newburyport . The last troops marched off on September 13 ; Arnold rode from Cambridge to Newburyport on September 15 after making final purchases of supplies . 
 <unk> and fog delayed the departure of the expedition from Newburyport until September 19 . In twelve hours , they reached the mouth of the Kennebec River . They spent the next two days negotiating the island channels near its mouth and sailing up the river . Arriving in <unk> on the 22nd , they spent the next few days at Reuben Colburn 's house , organizing supplies and preparing the boats they would use for the rest of the expedition . Arnold inspected Colburn 's hastily constructed bateaux , finding them , in a portent of troubles to come , to be " very badly built " , and " smaller than the directions given " . Colburn and his crew spent the next three days building additional bateaux . 
 Arnold 's troop movements did not escape British notice . General Thomas Gage in Boston was aware that Arnold 's troops were " gone to Canada and by way of Newburyport " , but he believed the target to be Nova Scotia , which was at the time virtually undefended . Francis Legge , the governor of Nova Scotia , declared martial law , and on October 17 sent a message to England laden with rumors about American actions that turned out to be false . Admiral Samuel Graves eventually received intelligence about Arnold 's activities , reporting on October 18 that the American troops " went up the Kennebec River , and ' tis generally believed are for Quebec " . 
 = = Scouting = = 
 As the troop transports arrived , Arnold dispatched some of the men in the already @-@ constructed bateaux up the Kennebec River 10 miles ( 16 km ) to Fort Western , and the others by foot on a track leading to Fort Halifax , 45 miles ( 72 km ) up the Kennebec . While waiting for the bateaux to be completed , Arnold received word from scouts Colburn had sent out to reconnoiter the proposed route . Their reports included rumors of a large Mohawk force near the southernmost French settlements on the Chaudière River . The source of these rumors was <unk> , a Norridgewock Indian believed to be spying for Quebec 's governor , General Guy Carleton ; Arnold discounted the reports . 
 Arnold and most of the force had reached Fort Western by September 23 . The next day , Arnold sent two small parties up the Kennebec . One , under Pennsylvania Lieutenant Archibald Steele , was ordered to scout as far as Lake Mégantic to gather intelligence . The second , under Lieutenant Church , was to survey the route as far as the Dead River , at a place known to the local Indians as the Great Carrying Place , so that Arnold might better estimate how far the column would need to travel each day . 
 = = Early troubles = = 
 The full expedition set out from Fort Western on September 25 . Morgan 's riflemen led the way , blazing trails when necessary . Colburn and a crew of <unk> came in the rear , to repair bateaux as needed . Morgan 's group traveled relatively lightly , as they would be working to make the trail , while the last group , commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Enos , carried the bulk of the supplies . The expedition arrived at its first target , Fort Halifax , a decaying relic of the French and Indian War , on the second day . There was a rough track from Fort Western , so some of the men and supplies had moved overland rather than in the bateaux that had to be portaged around the falls above Fort Western to begin the trip . Arnold , rather than traveling in a heavy <unk> , traveled in a lighter canoe so that he might move more rapidly among the troops along the travel route . 
 Arnold reached Norridgewock Falls , location of the last settlements on the Kennebec , on October 2 . Even at this early date , problems were apparent . The bateaux were leaking , resulting in spoiled food and a continual need for repairs . The men were constantly wet , due not only to the leakage but also the frequent need to pull the heavy boats upstream . As temperatures began to drop below freezing , colds and dysentery set in , reducing the effectiveness of the force . 
 The portage around Norridgewock Falls , a distance of about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , was accomplished with the assistance of oxen provided by the local settlers , but it took almost a week to complete ; Arnold did not depart from there until October 9 . Colburn 's crew devoted some of this time to making repairs on the bateaux . Most of the expedition reached the Great Carrying Place on October 11 , and Arnold arrived the next day . This stretch of the trek was complicated by heavy rains , rendering the portages difficult due to extremely muddy conditions . 
 = = The Great Carrying Place = = 
 The Great Carrying Place was a portage of roughly 12 miles ( 19 km ) , bypassing an unnavigable section of the Dead River , the tributary of the Kennebec that the expedition was to follow . The portage included a rise in elevation of about 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 305 m ) to the high points of the carry , with three ponds along the way . Lieutenant Church , the leader of the survey team , described the route as a " bad road but capable of being made good " , an assessment that turned out to be somewhat optimistic . 
 The vanguard of the main body , led by Daniel Morgan , met Lieutenant Steele 's advance scouting party en route to the first pond . This party had successfully scouted the route to the height of land above the Dead River , but the men were near starvation . Their supplies had been depleted , and they were largely subsisting on a protein @-@ rich diet of fish , moose , and duck . Most of the men continued to supplement their meager supplies with the local wildlife as the expedition continued . 
 Church , in his description of the route , had failed to account for the heavy rains and the generally boggy conditions between the first and second ponds . Rain and snow slowed the long portage , and the expedition had its first casualty when a falling tree killed one of the party . Some of the men who drank the brackish waters along the way became violently ill , forcing Arnold to order construction of a shelter at the second pond as cover for the sick , and to send some men back to Fort Halifax for supplies that had been cached there . 
 The first two battalions finally reached the Dead River on October 13 , and Arnold arrived three days later . At this point , Arnold wrote a number of letters informing Washington and Montgomery of his progress . Several letters intended for Montgomery were intercepted and turned over to Quebec 's Lieutenant Governor Hector Theophilus de Cramahé , giving Quebec its first notice that the expedition was on its way . Arnold also dispatched the survey team again , this time to mark the trail all the way to Lake Mégantic . 
 = = Ascending the Dead River = = 
 Progress up the Dead River was extremely slow . Contrary to its name , which supposedly described the speed of its currents , the river was flowing rapidly enough that the men had trouble rowing and poling against the current . The leaky boats spoiled more of the food , forcing Arnold to put everyone on half rations . Then , on October 19 , the skies opened , and the river began to rise in the pouring rain . Early on October 22 , the men awoke to discover that the river had risen to the level of their camp , and they had to scramble to even higher ground for safety . When the sun rose they were surrounded by water . 
 After spending most of that day drying out , the expedition set off on October 23 . Precious time was lost when some of the men mistakenly left the Dead River and ascended one of its branches , having been fooled by the high water . Soon after , seven bateaux overturned , spoiling the remaining food stores . This accident compelled Arnold to consider turning back . He called together his nearby officers for a council of war . Arnold explained that although the situation was grim , he thought that the expedition should continue . The officers agreed , and decided to pick an advance party that would proceed as rapidly as possible to French settlements on the Chaudière , and work to bring supplies back . The sick and infirm were to retreat to American settlements in Maine . 
 Further back on the route , Lieutenant Colonel Greene and his men were starving . They had little flour , and were consuming candle wax and shoe leather to supplement their minimal rations . On October 24 , Greene attempted to catch up with Arnold , but was unable to do so because Arnold had moved too far ahead . When he returned to camp , Lieutenant Colonel Enos had arrived , and they held their own council . Enos 's captains were united in wanting to turn back despite Arnold 's most recent orders , which were to press ahead . In the council , Enos cast a tie @-@ breaking vote in favor of continuing , but in a meeting with his captains after the council , announced that because they were insistent on returning , he was acceding to their decision , and would return . After giving Greene 's men some of his supplies , Enos and 450 men turned back . 
 = = Lake Mégantic = = 
 The impact of the inaccurate maps was felt when the expedition reached the height of land . Portions of the advance party became lost in swampy bogs ( the area surrounding Spider Lake on the topographic map shown above ) that were not on those maps , resulting in delays reaching Lake Mégantic . Although this part of the party crossed the height of land on October 25 , it was not until two days later that they reached the lake . On October 28 , the advance party descended the upper Chaudière , destroying three of their bateaux when they turned over and crashed into rocks above some falls on the river . The next day they encountered several Penobscot Indians , who confirmed that they were not far from <unk> , the southernmost French settlement on the Chaudière . 
 Arnold , when he reached Lake Mégantic , sent a man back to the two remaining battalions with instructions on how to navigate the swampy lands above the lake . However , the way Arnold described the route included information from the incorrect maps that he had not seen on the route . As a result , some elements of the expedition spent two days lost in swamps before the majority finally reached the falls on the upper Chaudière on October 31 . Along the way , Captain Henry Dearborn 's dog was eaten , an event recorded in his diary : " [ They ate ] every part of him , not excepting his entrails ; and after finishing their meal , they collected the bones and carried them to be pounded up , and to make broth for another meal . " 
 = = Arrival at Quebec = = 
 Arnold first made contact with the local population on October 30 . Sympathetic to his plight , they supplied provisions and cared for the sick ; some were well paid for their aid , while others refused payment . Arnold distributed copies of a letter written by Washington asking the habitants to assist the expedition , and Arnold added promises to respect the persons , property , and religion of the locals . Jacques Parent , a Canadien from Pointe @-@ Levi , notified Arnold that Lieutenant Governor Cramahé had ordered the destruction of all boats on the southern banks of the Saint Lawrence after receiving the intercepted communications . 
 On November 9 the expedition finally reached the Saint Lawrence at Pointe @-@ Levi , across the river from Quebec . Arnold had about 600 of his original 1 @,@ 100 men , and the journey had turned out to be 350 miles ( 560 km ) , not the 180 that Arnold and Washington had thought it would be . From John Halstead , a New Jersey @-@ born businessman who operated a mill near Pointe @-@ Levi , Arnold learned of the arrest of his courier and the interception of some of his letters . Halstead 's mill became the organizing point for the crossing of the Saint Lawrence . Some of Arnold 's men purchased canoes from the habitants and the local Saint Francis Indians , and then transported them from the Chaudière to the mill site . The forces crossed the Saint Lawrence on the night of November 13 – 14 after three days of bad weather , likely crossing the mile @-@ wide river between the positions of HMS Hunter and HMS Lizard , two Royal Navy ships that were guarding the river against such a crossing . 
 The city of Quebec was then defended by about 150 men of the Royal Highland Emigrants under Lieutenant Colonel Allen Maclean , supported by about 500 poorly organized local militia and 400 marines from the two warships . When Arnold and his troops finally reached the Plains of Abraham on November 14 , Arnold sent a negotiator with a white flag to demand their surrender , to no avail . The Americans , with no cannons or other field artillery , and barely fit for action , faced a fortified city . After hearing rumors of a planned sortie from the city , Arnold decided on November 19 to withdraw to Pointe @-@ aux @-@ Trembles to wait for Montgomery , who had recently captured Montreal . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 When Montgomery arrived at Pointe @-@ aux @-@ Trembles on December 3 , the combined force returned to the city and began a siege , finally assaulting it on December 31 . The battle was a devastating loss for the Americans ; Montgomery was killed , Arnold was wounded , and Daniel Morgan was captured along with more than 350 men . Arnold did not learn until after the battle that he had been promoted to brigadier general for his role in leading the expedition . 
 The invasion ended with a retreat back to Fort Ticonderoga , Montgomery 's starting point , during the spring and summer of 1776 . Arnold , who commanded the army 's rear guard in the later stages of the retreat , was able to delay the British advance sufficiently to prevent them from attempting to reach the Hudson River in 1776 . 
 Enos and his detachment arrived back in Cambridge late in November . Enos was court @-@ martialed , charged with " quitting his commanding officer without leave " . He was acquitted , and returned to service as Lieutenant Colonel of the 16th Connecticut Regiment . 
 John Sullivan , the court @-@ martial President , made public a written statement in support of Enos ' conduct , and other officers also issued a public circular to support Enos , including William Heath , John Stark , Joseph Reed , and James Reed . 
 Enos subsequently moved to Vermont , where he served in the militia as Colonel , Brigadier General and Major General , including commanding troops on the Vermont side of Lake Champlain during the Saratoga campaign to deter John Burgoyne from <unk> into Vermont . 
 Reuben Colburn was never paid for his work , despite promises made by Arnold and Washington ; the expedition ruined him financially . 
 Henry Dearborn settled on the Kennebec River after the war , and represented the area in the U. S. Congress before Thomas Jefferson appointed him Secretary of War . Private Simon Fobes , who kept one of the many journals of the expedition , was captured in the Battle of Quebec . He and two others escaped captivity in August 1776 and retraced the trek in the opposite direction , once again with meager resources . They benefited from better weather and equipment the expedition had abandoned along the way . Fobes reached his home near Worcester , Massachusetts at the end of September , and eventually rejoined the army . Captain Simeon Thayer kept a journal which was published by the Rhode Island Historical Society in 1867 as The invasion of Canada in 1775 . After being captured at Quebec , Thayer was exchanged on July 1 , 1777 and returned to the Continental Army with the rank of major . He distinguished himself during the Siege of Fort Mifflin in November 1777 and briefly assumed command after the post 's commandant was wounded .

 A number of geographic features along the route of the expedition bear names related to the expedition . East Carry Pond , Middle Carry Pond , and West Carry Pond , are all on the route of the portage at the Great Carrying Place , which is in the Carrying Place Town Township [ sic ] of Maine . Arnold Pond is the last pond on the Dead River before crossing the height of land . Mount Bigelow in Maine was named for Major Timothy Bigelow , one of Arnold 's officers . 
 The wilderness portion of the route through Maine , roughly from Augusta to the Quebec border , was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 as the " Arnold Trail to Quebec " . The Major Reuben Colburn House , which served as Arnold 's headquarters , is now a state historic site administered by the non @-@ profit Arnold Expedition Historical Society , and is also listed on the National Register . Both Fort Western and Fort Halifax are National Historic Landmarks , primarily for their age and their role in earlier conflicts . 
 An historical marker in Danvers , Massachusetts commemorates Arnold 's expedition , placed by the Massachusetts Society , Sons of the American Revolution . There is also an historical marker in Moscow , Maine placed in 1916 by the Kennebec chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution , and two at Skowhegan Island in Maine placed in 1912 and 2000 by the Eunice Farnsworth Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution . In Eustis , Maine , on the western shore of Flagstaff Lake stands a marker commemorating the expedition . The lake was created in the 20th century by damming the Dead River , inundating part of the expedition route . Mount Bigelow , whose first recorded ascent was by Timothy Bigelow , stands just south of the lake . 
 = Star Trek : First Contact = 
 Star Trek : First Contact is a 1996 American science fiction film released by Paramount Pictures . It is the eighth feature film in the Star Trek film franchise , and the second film in the series to star the cast of the television series Star Trek : The Next Generation . In the film 's plot , the crew of the USS Enterprise @-@ E travel back in time to the 21st century to save their future after the cybernetic Borg conquered Earth by changing the timeline . 
 After the release of the seventh film , Star Trek Generations ( 1994 ) , Paramount tasked writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore with developing a sequel . Braga and Moore wanted to feature the Borg in the plot , while producer Rick Berman wanted a story involving time travel . The writers combined the two ideas ; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance , but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid @-@ 21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too kitsch . After two better known directors turned down the job , cast member Jonathan Frakes was chosen to direct to make sure the task fell to someone who understood Star Trek . It was Frakes ' first theatrical film . 
 The script required the creation of new starship designs , including a new USS Enterprise . Production designer Herman Zimmerman and illustrator John Eaves collaborated to make a sleeker ship than its predecessor . Principal photography began with weeks of location shooting in Arizona and California before production moved to new sets for the ship @-@ based scenes . The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside @-@ out ; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series . Effects company Industrial Light & Magic rushed to complete the film 's special effects in less than five months . Traditional optical effects techniques were supplemented with computer @-@ generated imagery . Jerry Goldsmith and his son Joel collaborated to produce the film 's score . 
 First Contact was the highest @-@ grossing film on its opening weekend , making $ 30 @.@ 7 million . The film made $ 92 million in the United States and an additional $ 54 million in other territories , for a worldwide total of $ 146 million . Critical reception was mostly positive ; critics including Roger Ebert considered it one of the best Star Trek films . The Borg and the special effects were lauded , while characterization was less evenly received . First Contact was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Makeup and won three Saturn Awards . The film has been released on videotape , LaserDisc , DVD and Blu @-@ ray home video formats . Scholarly analysis of the film has focused on Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard 's parallels to Herman Melville 's Ahab and the nature of the Borg . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard wakes from a nightmare in which he relived his assimilation by the cybernetic Borg six years earlier ( shown in the television episode " The Best of Both Worlds " ) . Starfleet informs him of a new Borg attack against Earth , but orders the USS Enterprise @-@ E to patrol the Romulan Neutral Zone so as not to introduce an " unstable element " to the fight . Learning that the fleet is losing the battle , the Enterprise crew disobeys orders and heads for Earth , where a single , damaged Borg Cube opposes a group of Starfleet vessels . The Enterprise arrives in time to save the crew of the USS Defiant which is being commanded by Lieutenant Commander Worf . After Picard hears Borg communications in his mind , he orders the fleet to concentrate its firepower on a seemingly non @-@ vital section of the Borg ship . The Cube is destroyed after launching a smaller sphere ship towards the planet . 
 The Borg sphere generates and enters a temporal vortex . As the Enterprise is enveloped in the vortex , the crew briefly glimpses an Earth populated entirely by Borg . Picard realizes that the Borg have used time travel to change history , and orders the Enterprise to follow . The Enterprise arrives in the past , on April 4 , 2063 , the day before humanity 's first encounter with alien life after Zefram Cochrane 's historic warp flight . The Borg sphere fires on the planet ; the Enterprise crew then destroy the sphere and , realizing that the Borg were trying to prevent first contact , send an away team to the Montana missile complex where Cochrane is building his ship , the Phoenix , to look for survivors . Picard sends Cochrane 's assistant Lily Sloane to the Enterprise for medical attention , then returns to the ship and leaves Commander William Riker on Earth to make sure the Phoenix 's flight proceeds as planned . The Enterprise crew sees Cochrane as a legend , but the real man is reluctant to assume his historical role . 
 Borg survivors invade the Enterprise , and begin to assimilate its crew and modify the ship , planning to use it to attack and conquer Earth . Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with corrosive coolant used in the warp core , but the android Data is captured and meets the queen of the Borg Collective , who gains his trust by giving part of him human skin . A frightened Sloane seizes the captain but he gains her trust , and they escape the Borg @-@ infested area of the ship by using the holodeck . Picard , Worf , and the ship 's navigator , Lieutenant Hawk , stop the Borg from calling reinforcements with the deflector dish , but Hawk is assimilated . As the Borg continue to assimilate , Worf suggests destroying the ship , but Picard angrily calls him a coward and vows to continue the fight . Sloane confronts the captain and , reminding him of Moby @-@ Dick 's Captain Ahab , makes him realize he 's acting irrationally . Picard activates the ship 's self @-@ destruct mechanism , orders the crew to abandon ship , and then apologizes to Worf . While the crew heads to escape pods , Picard remains aboard to rescue Data . 
 As Cochrane , Riker , and engineer Geordi La Forge prepare to activate the warp drive on the Phoenix , Picard confronts the Borg Queen and discovers she has grafted human skin onto Data , giving him an array of new sensations . She has presented this modification as a gift to the android , hoping to obtain his encryption codes to the Enterprise computer . Although Picard offers himself in Data 's place , the android refuses to leave . He deactivates the self @-@ destruct sequence and fires torpedoes at the Phoenix , but they miss and the Queen realizes Data betrayed her . Data ruptures a coolant tank , and the corrosive substance fatally dissolves the Borg 's biological components . Cochrane completes his warp flight , and that night , April 5 , 2063 , the crew watches as Vulcans , attracted by the Phoenix warp flight , land and greet Cochrane . Having repaired history , the Enterprise crew returns to the 24th century . 
 = = Cast = = 
 First Contact is the first film in the Star Trek film series in which none of the main cast of Star Trek : The Original Series appear ; instead , the main cast of Star Trek : The Next Generation fill the main roles . Patrick Stewart plays Jean @-@ Luc Picard , the captain of the USS Enterprise @-@ E who is haunted by his time as a member of the Borg Collective . Stewart was one of the few cast members who had an important role in developing the script , offering suggestions and comments . Picard 's character was changed from the " angst @-@ ridden character [ viewers have ] seen before " , to an action hero type . Stewart noted that Picard was more physically active in the film compared with his usual depiction . 
 Other Enterprise crewmembers include the ship 's first officer William Riker , played by director Jonathan Frakes . Frakes said he did not have much difficulty directing and acting at the same time , having done so on the television series . Brent Spiner portrays the android Data ; rumors before the film 's release suggested that since Data 's skin had been largely removed at the end of the story , it would allow another actor to assume the role . LeVar Burton plays Geordi La Forge , the ship 's chief engineer . La Forge is a blind character , and for the television series and previous film had worn a special visor to see . Burton lobbied for many years to have his character 's visor replaced so that people could see his eyes , since the " air filter " he wore prevented the audience from seeing his eyes and limited his acting ability . Moore finally agreed , giving the character ocular implants that were never explained in the film , beyond showing they were artificial . Gates McFadden plays Beverly Crusher , the ship 's doctor . McFadden considered Star Trek women finally on par with the men : " We 've come a long way since Majel Barrett was stuck in the sick bay as Nurse Chapel in the [ 1960s ] and made to dye her hair blond . " Crusher was instrumental in helping Picard set the auto @-@ destruct sequence , to prevent the Borg from completely assimilating the Enterprise and Earth . Ship 's counselor Deanna Troi is portrayed by Marina Sirtis . The actress missed working on the television show , and was acutely aware that expectations and stakes for First Contact were high : " we were scared that people thought we couldn 't cut it without the original cast " , she said . Other Starfleet members included former Enterprise chief of security , and commander of the USS Defiant , Worf ( Michael Dorn ) . The Defiant is badly damaged in the battle with the Borg but is left salvageable . An early screenplay draft called for the Defiant to be destroyed , but Deep Space Nine executive producer Ira Steven Behr objected to the destruction of his show 's ship and so the idea was dropped . Neal McDonough plays Sean Hawk , the Enterprise helmsman who aids in the defense of the ship until he is assimilated and killed . McDonough was cavalier about his role as an expendable " redshirt " , saying that since one of the characters in the deflector dish battle had to die , " that would be me " . 
 James Cromwell was cast as Zefram Cochrane , the pilot and creator of Earth 's first warp capable vessel . The character of Zefram Cochrane had first appeared in the Original Series episode " Metamorphosis " , played by Glenn Corbett . Cromwell 's Cochrane is much older and has no real resemblance to Corbett , which did not bother the writers . They wanted to portray Cochrane as a character going through a major transition ; he starts out as a cynical , selfish drunk who is changed by the characters he meets over the course of the film . Although the character was written with Cromwell in mind , Tom Hanks , a big fan of Star Trek , was approached for the role by Paramount first , but he had already committed to the film That Thing You Do ! and had to reject the part . Frakes commented that it would have been a mistake to cast Hanks as Cochrane due to him being so well known . Cromwell had a long previous association with Star Trek , having played characters in The Next Generation episodes " The Hunted " and " Birthright " , as well as a role in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . " [ Cromwell ] actually came in and read for the part " , Frakes said . " He nailed it . " Cromwell described his method of portraying Cochrane as always playing himself . Part of the actor 's interest in the film was his involvement in Steven M. Greer 's Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence , which offers training for first contact scenarios . In this film , Cromwell 's Cochrane became the first character to use the phrase " star trek " in the history of the franchise ( " You 're all astronauts , on some kind of star trek . " ) 
 Alfre Woodard plays Lily Sloane , Cochrane 's assistant . When Frakes first moved to Los Angeles , Woodard was one of the first people he met . During a conversation at a barbecue , Woodard said she would become Frakes ' godmother , as he did not have one . Through this relationship , Frakes was able to cast Woodard in the film ; he considered it a coup to land an Academy Award @-@ nominated actress . Woodard considered Lily to be the character most like herself out of all the roles she has played . 
 The Borg Queen is portrayed by Alice Krige . Casting for the part took time , as the actress needed to be sexy , dangerous and mysterious . Frakes cast Krige after finding that she had all of the mentioned qualities , and being impressed by her performance in Ghost Story ; the director considers her the sexiest Star Trek villain of all time . Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role ; her costume was too tight , causing blisters , and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time . Krige would later reprise her role as the Borg Queen in the Star Trek : Voyager series finale " Endgame " . 
 The ominous voice of the Borg , which delivered the now @-@ iconic film line , " Resistance is futile " , was performed by Jeff <unk> . 
 The film also features minor roles for many of The Next Generation 's recurring characters ; Dwight Schultz reprised his role of Lieutenant Reginald Barclay , while Patti <unk> briefly appeared as Nurse Alyssa Ogawa . Whoopi Goldberg was not asked to return as Guinan , a wise bartender whose homeworld was destroyed by the Borg . Goldberg only learned about the decision through the newspapers . " What can I say ? I wanted to do it because I didn 't think you could do anything about the Borg without [ my character ] " , she said , " but apparently you can , so they don 't need me . " Michael Horton appears as a bloodied and stoic Starfleet defender ; his character would be given the name of Daniels in the next Star Trek film . 
 The third draft of the script added cameos by two actors from the sister television series Star Trek : Voyager . Robert Picardo appears as the Enterprise 's Emergency Medical Hologram ; Picardo played the holographic Doctor on Voyager . His line " I 'm a doctor , not a door stop " , is an allusion to the Star Trek original series character Dr. Leonard McCoy . Picardo 's fellow Voyager actor Ethan Phillips , who played Neelix , cameos as a nightclub Maitre d ' in the holodeck scene . Phillips recalled that the producers wanted the fans to be left guessing whether he was the person who played Neelix or not , as he did not appear in the credits ; " It was just kind of a goofy thing to do . " During production there were incorrect rumors that Avery Brooks would reprise his role as Star Trek : Deep Space Nine captain Benjamin Sisko . As with many Star Trek productions , new , disposable redshirt characters are killed off over the course of the plot .

 In February 1995 , two months after the release of Star Trek : Generations , Paramount decided to produce another Star Trek feature for a winter holiday 1996 release . Paramount wanted writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore , who had written the Generations script and a number of Next Generation episodes , to pen the screenplay . Producer Rick Berman told Braga and Moore that he wanted them to think about doing a story involving time travel . Braga and Moore , meanwhile , wanted to use the Borg . " Right on the spot , we said maybe we can do both , the Borg and time travel , " Moore recalled . The Borg had not been seen in full force since the fourth season episode of The Next Generation , " The Best of Both Worlds " , and had never been heavily featured in the series due to budget constraints and the fear that they would lose their scare factor . " The Borg were really liked by the fans , and we liked them , " Moore said . " They were fearsome . They were unstoppable . Perfect foils for a feature story . " 
 In deciding to combine the two story ideas , the writers decided that the time travel element could play out as the Borg attempt to prevent humanity from ever reaching space and becoming a threat . " Our goals at that point were to create a story that was wonderful and a script that was [ ... ] producible within the budget confines of a Star Trek film " , said Berman . One major question was identifying the time period to which the Borg would travel . Berman 's suggestion was the Renaissance ; the Borg would attempt to prevent the dawn of modern European civilization . The first story draft , titled Star Trek : Renaissance , had the crew of the Enterprise track the Borg to their hive in a castle dungeon . The film would have featured sword fights alongside phasers in 15th @-@ century Europe , while Data became Leonardo da Vinci 's apprentice . Moore was afraid that it risked becoming campy and over @-@ the @-@ top , while Stewart refused to wear tights . Braga , meanwhile , wanted to see the " birth of Star Trek " , when the Vulcans and humans first met ; " that , to me , is what made the time travel story fresh " , he said . 
 With the idea of Star Trek 's genesis in mind , the central story became Cochrane 's warp drive test and humanity 's first contact . Drawing on clues from previous Star Trek episodes , Cochrane was placed in mid @-@ 21st century Montana , where humans recover from a devastating world war . In the first script with this setting , the Borg attack Cochrane 's lab , leaving the scientist comatose ; Picard assumes Cochrane 's place to continue the warp test and restore history . In this draft Picard has a love interest in the local photographer Ruby , while Riker leads the fight against the Borg on the Enterprise . Another draft included John de Lancie 's omnipotent character Q. Looking at the early scripts , the trio knew that serious work was needed . " It just didn 't make sense [ ... ] that Picard , the one guy who has a history with the Borg , never meets them , " Braga recalled . Riker and Picard 's roles were swapped , and the planetside story was shortened and told differently . Braga and Moore focused the new arc on Cochrane himself , making the ideal future of Star Trek come from a flawed man . The idea of Borg fighting among period costumes coalesced into a " Dixon Hill " holographic novel sequence on the holodeck . The second draft , titled Star Trek : Resurrection , was judged complete enough that the production team used it to plan expenses . The film was given a budget of $ 45 million , " considerably more " than Generations ' $ 35 million price tag ; this allowed the production to plan a larger amount of action and special effects . 
 Braga and Moore intended the film to be easily accessible to any moviegoer and work as a stand @-@ alone story , yet still satisfy the devoted Star Trek fans . Since much of Picard 's role made a direct reference to his time as a Borg in The Next Generation episodes " The Best of Both Worlds " , the opening dream sequence was added to explain what happened to him in the show . The pair discarded an opening which would have established what the main characters had been doing since the last film in favor of quickly setting the story . While the writers tried to preserve the idea of the Borg as a mindless collective in the original draft , Paramount head Jonathan Dolgen felt that the script was not dramatic enough . He suggested adding an individual Borg villain with whom the characters could interact , which led to the creation of the Borg Queen . 
 Cast member Frakes was chosen to direct . Frakes had not been the first choice for director ; Ridley Scott and John McTiernan reportedly turned down the project . Stewart met a potential candidate and concluded that " they didn 't know Star Trek " . It was decided to stay with someone who understood the " gestalt of Star Trek " , and Frakes was given the job . Frakes reported to work every day at 6 : 30 am . A major concern during the production was security — the script to Generations had been leaked online , and stronger measures were taken to prevent a similar occurrence . Some script pages were distributed on red paper to foil attempted photocopies or faxes ; " We had real trouble reading them , " Frakes noted . 
 Frakes had directed multiple episodes of The Next Generation , Deep Space Nine and Voyager , but First Contact was his first feature film . Whereas Frakes had seven days of preparation followed by seven days of shooting for a given television episode , the director was given a ten @-@ week preparation period before twelve weeks of filming , and had to get used to shooting for a 2 @.@ 35 : 1 anamorphic ratio instead of the television standard 1 @.@ 33 : 1 . In preparation , he watched Jaws , Close Encounters of the Third Kind , 2001 : A Space Odyssey and the works of James Cameron and Ridley Scott . 
 Throughout multiple script revisions a number of titles were considered , including Star Trek : Borg , Star Trek : Destinies , Star Trek : Future Generations and Star Trek : Generations II . The planned title of Resurrection was scrapped when Fox announced the title of the fourth Alien film ; the movie was rebranded First Contact on May 3 , 1996 . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 First Contact was the first Star Trek film to make significant use of computer @-@ generated starship models , though physical miniatures were still used for the most important vessels . With the Enterprise @-@ D destroyed during the events of Generations , the task of creating a new starship fell to veteran Star Trek production designer Herman Zimmerman . The script 's only guide on the appearance of the vessel was the line " the new Enterprise sleekly comes out of the nebula " . Working with illustrator John Eaves , the designers conceived the new Sovereign Class Enterprise @-@ E as " leaner , sleeker , and mean enough to answer any Borg threat you can imagine " . Braga and Moore intended it to be more muscular and <unk> . Eaves looked at the structure of previous Enterprise iterations , and designed a more streamlined , capable war vessel than the Enterprise @-@ D , reducing the neck area of the ship and lengthening the nacelles . Eaves produced 30 to 40 sketches before he found a final design he liked and began making minor changes . Working from blueprints created by Paramount 's Rick Sternbach , the model shop at effects house Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) fabricated a 10 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 2 m ) miniature over a five @-@ month period . Hull patterns were carved out of wood , then cast and assembled over an aluminum armature . The model 's panels were painted in an alternating matte and gloss scheme to add texture . The crew had multiple difficulties in prepping the miniature for filming ; while the model shop originally wanted to save time by casting windows using a clear fiberglass , the material came out tacky . ILM instead cut the windows using a laser . Slides of the sets were added behind the window frames to make the interior seem more dimensional when the camera tracked past the ship . 
 In previous films , Starfleet 's range of capital ships had been predominantly represented by the Constitution class Enterprise and just five other ship classes : the Miranda class from Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan ( represented by the USS Reliant ) , the Excelsior and the Oberth class Grissom from Star Trek III : The Search for Spock , and the Galaxy and Nebula classes from The Next Generation . ILM supervisor John Knoll insisted that First Contact 's space battle prove the breadth of Starfleet 's ship configurations . " Starfleet would probably throw everything it could at the Borg , including ships we 've never seen before " , he reasoned . " And since we figured a lot of the background action in the space battle would need to be done with computer @-@ generated ships that needed to be built from scratch anyway , I realized there was no reason not to do some new designs . " Alex Jaeger was appointed visual effects art director to the film and assigned the task of creating four new starships . Paramount wanted ships that would look different from a distance , so the director devised multiple hull profiles . Knoll and Jaeger had decided that the ships had to obey certain Star Trek ship precedents , with a saucer @-@ like primary hull and elongated warp nacelles in pairs . The Akira class featured the traditional saucer section and nacelles combined with a catamaran @-@ style double hull ; the Norway class was based on the USS Voyager ; the Saber class was a smaller ship with nacelles trailing off the tips of its saucer section ; and the <unk> class featured twin nacelles trailing off the saucer and connected by an engineering section in the rear . Each design was modeled as a three @-@ dimensional digital wire @-@ frame model for use in the film . 
 The film also required a number of smaller non @-@ Starfleet designs . The warp ship Phoenix was conceived as fitting inside an old nuclear missile , meaning that the ship 's nacelles had to fold into a space of less than 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) . Eaves made sure to emphasize the mechanical aspect of the ship , to suggest it was a highly experimental and untested technology . The Phoenix 's cockpit labels came from McDonnell @-@ Douglas space shuttle manuals . Eaves considered the Vulcan ship a " fun " vessel to design . Only two major Vulcan ships had been previously seen in Star Trek , including a courier vessel from The Motion Picture . Since the two @-@ engine ship format had been seen many times , the artists decided to step away from the traditional ship layout , creating a more artistic than functional design . The ship incorporated elements of a starfish and a crab . Because of budget constraints , the full ship was realized as a computer @-@ generated design . Only a boomerang @-@ shaped landing foot was fabricated for the actors to interact with . 
 The Enterprise interior sets were mostly new designs . The bridge was designed to be comfortable @-@ looking , with warm colors . Among the new additions was a larger holographic viewscreen that would operate only when activated , leaving a plain wall when disabled . New flatscreen computer monitors were used for displays , using less space and giving the bridge a cleaner look . The new monitors also allowed for video playback that could simulate interaction with the actors . The designers created a larger and less spartan ready room , retaining elements from the television series ; Zimmerman added a set of golden three @-@ dimensional Enterprise models to a glass case in the corner . The observation lounge was similar to the design in the Enterprise @-@ D ; the set itself was re @-@ used from the television show , the only such set not to be struck following the filming of Generations , though it was expanded and underwent a color change . Engineering was simulated with a large , three @-@ story set , corridors , a lobby , and the largest warp core in the franchise to date . For its Borg @-@ corrupted state , the engineering section was outfitted with Borg drone alcoves , conduits and Data 's " assimilation table " where he is interrogated by the Queen . Some existing sets were used to save money ; sickbay was a redress of the same location from Voyager , while the USS Defiant scenes used Deep Space Nine 's standing set . Some set designs took inspiration from the Alien film series , Star Wars and 2001 : A Space Odyssey . 
 The spacewalk scene on the Enterprise exterior was one of the most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film . The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated . Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated , and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant 's faces could be seen . When the actors first put the helmets on , the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe ; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill , and shooting was discontinued . The set for the ship 's outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount 's largest sound stage , surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences . The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full @-@ sized replica of the Enterprise dish , so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15 percent . 
 = = = Costumes and makeup = = = 
 The Starfleet uniforms were redesigned for the film by longtime Star Trek costumer Bob Blackman to give a more militaristic feel , with grey padded shoulders & department coloured undershirts . Since Blackman was also handling the costumes for the television series , non @-@ Starfleet design clothes were delegated to Deborah Everton , a newcomer to Star Trek who was responsible for more than 800 costumes during production . Everton was tasked with updating the Borg 's costumes to something new , but reminiscent of the television series . The bulky suits were made sleeker and outfitted with fiber optic lights . The time @-@ travel aspect of the story also required period costumes for the mid 21st century and the 1940s " Dixon Hill " nightclub holodeck recreation . Everton enjoyed designing Woodard 's costumes because the character went through many changes during the course of the film , switching from a utilitarian vest and pants in many shots to a glamorous dress during the holodeck scene . 
 Everton and makeup designers Michael Westmore , Scott Wheeler , and Jake Garber wanted to upgrade the pasty white look the Borg had retained since The Next Generation 's second season , born out of a need for budget @-@ conscious television design . " I wanted it to look like they were [ assimilated or " Borgified " ] from the inside out rather than the outside in , " Everton said . Each Borg had a slightly different design , and Westmore designed a new one each day to make it appear that there was an army of Borg ; in reality , between eight and twelve actors filled all the roles as the costumes and makeup were so expensive to produce . Background Borg were simulated by half @-@ finished mannequins . Westmore reasoned that since the Borg had traveled the galaxy , they would have assimilated other races besides humans . In the television series , much of the Borg 's faces had been covered by helmets , but for First Contact the makeup artist removed the head coverings and designed assimilated versions of familiar Star Trek aliens such as Klingons , <unk> , Romulans , Bajorans , and Cardassians . Each drone received an electronic eyepiece . The blinking lights in each eye were programmed by Westmore 's son to repeat a production member 's name in Morse code . 
 The makeup time for the Borg expanded from the single hour needed for television to five hours , in addition to the 30 minutes necessary to get into costume and 90 minutes to remove the makeup at the end of the day . While Westmore estimated that a fully staffed production would have around 50 makeup artists , First Contact had to make do with fewer than ten people involved in preparation , and at most 20 artists a day . Despite the long hours , Westmore 's teams began to be more creative with the prosthetics even as they decreased their preparation times . " They were using two tubes , and then they were using three tubes , and then they were sticking tubes in the ears and up the nose , " Westmore explained . " And we were using a very gooey caramel coloring , maybe using a little bit of it , but by the time we got to the end of the movie we had the stuff dripping down the side of [ the Borg 's ] faces — it looked like they were leaking oil ! So , at the very end [ of the film ] , they 're more ferocious . " 
 The Borg Queen was a challenge because she had to be unique among Borg but still retain human qualities ; Westmore was conscious of avoiding comparisons to films like Alien . The final appearance involved pale gray skin and an elongated , oval head , with coils of wire rather than hair . Krige recalled the first day she had her makeup applied : " I saw everyone cringing . I thought , great ; they made this , and they 've scared themselves ! " Frakes noted that the Queen ended up being alluring in a disturbing way , despite her evil behavior and appearance . Zimmerman , Everton and Westmore combined their efforts to design and create the Borgified sections of the Enterprise to build tension and to make the audience feel that " [ they are being fed ] the Borg " .

 Principal photography took a more leisurely pace than on The Next Generation because of a less hectic schedule ; only four pages of script had to be filmed each day , as opposed to eight on the television series . First Contact saw the introduction of cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti to the Star Trek franchise ; Frakes hired him out of admiration for some of his previous work on films such as Poltergeist and Strange Days . Leonetti was unfamiliar with the Star Trek mythos when Frakes approached him ; to prepare for the assignment , he studied the previous four films in the franchise , each with a different cinematographer — The Voyage Home ( Donald Peterman ) , The Final Frontier ( Andrew Laszlo ) , The Undiscovered Country ( Hiro Narita ) , and Generations ( John Alonzo ) . The cameraman also spent several days at the sets of Voyager and Deep Space Nine to observe filming . 
 Leonetti devised multiple lighting methods for the Enterprise interiors for ship standard operations , " Red alert " status , and emergency power . He reasoned that since the ship was being taken over by a foreign entity , it required more dramatic lighting and framing . While much of the footage was shot at 50 – 70 mm focal lengths using anamorphic lenses , 14 mm spherical lenses were used for Borg 's @-@ eye @-@ view shots . Leonetti preferred shooting with long lenses to provide a more claustrophobic feel , but made sure the length did not flatten the image . Handheld cameras were used for battle sequences so that viewers were brought into the action and the camera could follow the movements of the actors . The Borg scenes were received positively by test screening audiences , so once the rest of the film had been completed , a Borg assimilation scene of the Enterprise crew was added in using some of the money left in the budget to add action . 
 Since so many new sets had to be created , the production commenced filming with location photography . Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum , south of Tucson , Arizona — the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenix 's booster and command module . The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch , but the small size created difficulties . Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added , and electricians and grips donned rock @-@ climbing harnesses to move down the shaft and attach the lights . To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance , Leonetti chose to offset the missile 's metallic surface with complementary colors . Using different @-@ colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was ; to complete the effect , shots from the Phoenix 's nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30 mm lens to lengthen the missile . 
 After the completion of the Phoenix shots , the crew moved to two weeks of nighttime shooting in the Angeles National Forest . Zimmerman created a village of fourteen huts to stand in for Montana ; the cast enjoyed the scenes as a chance to escape their uniforms and wear " normal " clothes . The last location shoot was at an art deco restaurant in Los Angeles ' Union Station , which stood in for the Dixon Hill <unk> ; Frakes wanted a sharp contrast with the dark , mechanical Borg scenes . While the cinematographer wanted to shoot the scene in black and white , Paramount executives deemed the test footage " too experimental " and the idea was dropped . The site made using high @-@ wattage lights impractical , so Leonetti opted to use dimmer master lights near the ceiling and took advantage of a large window to shine diffused lights through . To give the scene a black @-@ and @-@ white feel , Leonetti made sure to use light without any coloration . " I like creating separation with lighting as opposed to using color , " he explained . " You can 't always rely on color because the actor might start to melt into the background . " By separating the backlights , Leonetti made sure that the principal actors stood out of the backdrop . The shoot used a ten @-@ piece orchestra , 15 stuntmen , and 120 extras to fill the seats . Among the nightclub patrons were Braga , Moore , and the film 's stunt coordinator , Ronnie Rondell . 
 After location shooting was completed , shooting on the new Engineering set began May 3 . The set lasted less than a day in its pristine condition before it was " Borgified " . Filming then proceeded to the bridge . During normal operation scenes , Leonetti chose to cast <unk> on the principals ; this required the ceiling of the set to be removed and lighting grids to be situated around the sides . These lights were then directed towards the actors ' faces at 90 @-@ degree angles . The set was lined with window paneling backed by red lights , which would blink intermittently during red @-@ alert status . These lights were supplemented by what Leonetti called " interactive light " ; these were off @-@ stage , red @-@ gelled lights that cast flashing rims on the bridge set and heads of the crew . For the Borg intrusion , the lighting originated solely from instrument panels and red @-@ alert displays . The fill light on these scenes was reduced so that the cast would pass through dark spots on the bridge and interiors out of the limited range of these sources . Small 30 and 50 watt lights were used to throw localized shafts of light onto the sets . 
 Next came the action sequences and the battle for the Enterprise , a phase the filmmakers dubbed " Borg Hell " . Frakes directed the Borg scenes similar to a horror film , creating as much suspense as possible . To balance these elements he added more comedic elements to the Earth scenes , intended to momentarily relieve the audience of tension before building it up again . Leonetti reconfigured the lighting to reflect the takeover of the ship interiors . " When the ship gets Borgified , everything is changed into more of a squared @-@ off , robotic look with sharp edges but rounded images , " he explained . To give the corridor walls more shape , Leonetti lit them from underneath . Since the halls were so small and the ceilings would be visible in many of the shots , special attention was paid to hiding the light fixtures . 
 For the live @-@ action spacewalk scenes , visual @-@ effects supervisor Moore spent two weeks of bluescreen photography at the deflector set . Frakes regarded filming the scene to be the most tedious in the film because of the amount of preparation it took for each day 's shoot . Since the rest of the Enterprise @-@ E , as well as the backdrop of Earth , were to be added later in post @-@ production , it became confusing to coordinate shots . Moore used a laptop with digital reproductions of the set to orient the crew and help Frakes understand what the finished shot would look like . A one @-@ armed actor portrayed the Borg whose arm Worf slices off to accurately portray the effect intended , and the actors ' shoes were fitted with lead weights to remind the actors they were to move slowly as if actually wearing gravity boots . McDonough recalled that he joined Stewart and Dorn in asking whether they could do the shots without the 10 @-@ to @-@ 15 @-@ pound ( 4 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 8 kg ) weights , as " they hired us because we are actors " , but the production insisted on using them . 
 The last scene filmed was the film 's first , Picard 's Borg nightmare . One camera shot begins inside the iris of Picard 's eyeball and pulls back to reveal the captain aboard a massive Borg ship . The shot continues to pull back and reveal the exterior of a Borg ship . The scene was inspired by a New York City production of Sweeney Todd , the Demon Barber of Fleet Street in which the stage surrounded the audience , giving a sense of realism . The shot was filmed as three separate elements merged with digital effects . The crew used a 50 @-@ mm lens to make it easier for the effects team to dissolve the closeup shots with the other elements . Starting from Stewart 's eye , the camera pulled back 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) , requiring the key light to increase in intensity up to 1000 <unk> so that there was enough depth to keep the eye sharp . The surface of the stage proved too uneven to accomplish the smooth dolly pullback required by the effects team , who needed a steady shot to blend a computer @-@ generated version of Picard 's eye with the pullback . The 135 @-@ foot ( 41 m ) dolly track was raised off the stage floor and layered with pieces of double @-@ thick birch plywood , chosen for its smooth finish . The entire set for the scene was 100 feet ( 30 m ) wide and 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) high ; gaps left by the dolly reveal were filled in later digitally . Principal photography finished on July 2 , 1996 , two days over schedule but still under budget .

 The majority of First Contact 's effects were handled by Industrial Light and Magic under the direction of John Knoll . Smaller effects sequences , such as phaser fire , computer graphics , and transporter effects , were delegated to a team led by visual @-@ effects supervisor David Takemura . Accustomed to directing episodes for the television series , Frakes was frequently reminded by effects artist Terry Frazee to " think big , blow everything up " . Most of the effects sequences were planned using low @-@ resolution computer @-@ generated animatics . These rough animated storyboards established length , action and composition , allowing the producers and director to ascertain how the sequences would play out before they were shot . 
 First Contact was the last film to feature a physical model of the Enterprise . For the ship 's dramatic introduction , the effects team combined motion control shots of the Enterprise model with a computer @-@ generated background . Sequence supervisor Dennis Turner , who had created Generations ' energy ribbon and specialized in creating natural phenomena , was charged with creating the star cluster , modeled after the Eagle Nebula . The nebular columns and solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry , with surface shaders applied to make the edges of the nebula glow . A particle render that ILM had devised for the earlier tornado film Twister was used to create a turbulent look within the nebula . Once the shots of the Enterprise had been captured , Turner inserted the ship into the computer @-@ generated background and altered its position until the images matched up . 
 The opening beauty pass of the new Enterprise was the responsibility of visual @-@ effects cinematographer Marty Rosenberg , who handled all the other miniatures , explosions , and some live @-@ action bluescreen elements . Rosenberg had previously shot some of the Enterprise @-@ D effects for Generations , but had to adjust his techniques for the new model ; the cinematographer used a 50 mm lens instead of the 35 mm used for Generations because the smaller lens made the new Enterprise 's dish appear stretched out . Knoll decided to shoot the model from above and below as much as possible ; side views made the ship appear too flat and elongated . Rosenberg preferred motion @-@ control passes of ships over computer @-@ generated versions , as it was much easier to capture a high level of detail with physical models rather than trying to recreate it by computer graphics . 
 For the Borg battle , Knoll insisted on closeup shots that were near the alien vessel , necessitating a physical model . ILM layered their 30 @-@ inch ( 76 cm ) model with an additional five inches of etched brass over a glowing neon lightbox for internal illumination . To make the Borg vessel appear even larger than it was , Knoll made sure that an edge of it was facing the camera like the prow of a ship and that the Cube broke the edges of the frame . To give the Cube greater depth and texture , Rosenberg shot the vessel with harsher light . " I created this really odd , raking three @-@ quarter backlight coming from the right or left side , which I balanced out with nets and a couple of little lights . I wanted it to look scary and mysterious , so it was lit like a point , and we always had the camera <unk> to it ; we never just had it coming straight at us , " he said . Small lights attached to the Cube 's surface helped to create visual interest and convey scale ; the model was deliberately shot with a slow , determined pacing to contrast with the Federation ships engaged in battle with the Borg . The impact of Federation weaponry on the Borg Cube was simulated using a 60 @-@ inch ( 150 cm ) model of the Cube . The model had specific areas which could be blown up multiple times without damaging the miniature . For the final explosion of the Cube , Rosenberg shot ten 30 @-@ inch ( 76 cm ) Cube miniatures with explosive @-@ packed lightweight skins . The Cubes were suspended from pipes sixty feet above the camera on the ground . Safety glass was placed over the lens to prevent damage , while the camera was covered with plywood to protect it from bits of plastic that rained down after each explosion . The smaller Borg sphere was a 12 @-@ inch ( 30 cm ) model that was shot separately from the Cube and digitally added in post @-@ production . The time @-@ travel vortex the Sphere creates was simulated with a rocket re @-@ entry effect ; <unk> forms in front of the ship , then streams backwards at high speed . Interactive lighting was played across the computer @-@ generated Enterprise model for when the ship is caught in the time vortex . 
 The miniature Enterprise was again used for the spacewalk sequence . Even on the large model , it was hard to make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close @-@ up shots . To make the pullback shot work , the camera had to be within one @-@ eighth of an inch from the model . Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close @-@ up , but even then the focus was barely adequate . To compensate , the crew used a wider @-@ angle lens and shot at the highest f @-@ stop they could . The live @-@ action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added . Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM 's parking lot at night . 
 ILM was tasked with imagining what the immediate assimilation of an Enterprise crewmember would look like . Jaeger came up with a set of cables that sprang from the Borg 's knuckles and buried themselves in the crewmember 's neck . <unk> tubes would course through the victim 's body and mechanical devices break the skin . The entire transformation was created using computer @-@ generated imagery . The wormlike geometry was animated over the actor 's face , then blended in with the addition of a skin texture over the animation . The gradual change in skin tone was simulated with shaders . 
 Frakes considered the entrance of the Borg Queen — where her head , shoulders , and steel spine are lowered by cables and attached to her body — as the " signature visual effect in the film " . The scene was difficult to execute , taking ILM five months to finish . Jaeger devised a rig that would lower the actress on the set , and applied a prosthetic spine over a blue suit so that ILM could remove Krige 's lower body . This strategy enabled the filmmakers to incorporate as many live @-@ action elements as possible without resorting to further digital effects . To make the prosthetics appear at the proper angle when her lower body was removed , Krige extended her neck forward so it appeared in line with the spine . Knoll did not want it to seem that the Queen was on a hard , mechanical rig ; " we wanted her to have the appropriate ' float ' , " he explained . Using separate motion control passes on the set , Knoll shot the lower of the upper torso and the secondary sequence with Krige 's entire body . A digital version of the Borg body suit was used for the lowering sequence , at which point the image was morphed back to the real shot of Krige 's body . The animated claws of the suit were created digitally as well using a detailed model . As reference to the animators , the shot required Krige to realistically portray " the strange pain or satisfaction of being reconnected to her body " .

 Film composer Jerry Goldsmith scored First Contact , his third Star Trek feature . Goldsmith wrote a sweeping main title which begins with Alexander Courage 's classic Star Trek fanfare . Instead of composing a menacing theme to underscore the Borg , Goldsmith wrote a pastoral theme linked to humanity 's hopeful first contact . The theme uses a four @-@ note motif used in Goldsmith 's Star Trek V : The Final Frontier score , which is used in First Contact as a friendship theme and general thematic link . A menacing march with touches of synthesizers was used to represent the Borg . In addition to composing new music , Goldsmith used music from his previous Star Trek scores , including his theme from The Motion Picture . The Klingon theme from the same film is used to represent Worf . 
 Because of delays with Paramount 's The Ghost and the Darkness , the already @-@ short four @-@ week production schedule was cut to just three weeks . While Berman was concerned about the move , Goldsmith hired his son , Joel , to assist . The young composer provided additional music for the film , writing three cues based on his father 's motifs and a total of 22 minutes of music . Joel used variations of his father 's Borg music and the Klingon theme as Worf fights hand @-@ to @-@ hand ( Joel said that he and his father decided to use the theme for Worf separately ) . When the Borg invade sickbay and the medical hologram distracts them , Joel wrote what critic Jeff Bond termed " almost <unk> " material of tuning strings and clarinet , but the cue was unused . While Joel composed many of the film 's action cues , his father contributed to the spacewalk and Phoenix flight sequences . During the fight on the deflector dish , Goldsmith used low @-@ register electronics punctuated by stabs of violent , dissonant strings . 
 In a break with Star Trek film tradition , the soundtrack incorporated two licensed songs : Roy Orbison 's " Ooby Dooby " and Steppenwolf 's " Magic Carpet Ride " . GNP Crescendo president Neil Norman explained that the decision to include the tracks was controversial , but said that " Frakes did the most amazing job of integrating those songs into the story that we had to use them " . 
 GNP released the First Contact soundtrack on December 2 , 1996 . The album contained 51 minutes of music , with 35 minutes of Jerry Goldsmith 's score , 10 minutes of additional music by Joel Goldsmith , " Ooby Dooby " and " Magic Carpet Ride " . The compact disc shipped with CD @-@ ROM features only accessible if played on a personal computer , including interviews with Berman , Frakes , and Goldsmith . 
 On April 2 , 2012 GNP Crescendo Records announced a limited @-@ edition collector ’ s CD featuring the complete score by Jerry Goldsmith ( with additional music by Joel Goldsmith ) , newly remastered by recording engineer Bruce Botnick , with an accompanying 16 @-@ page booklet including informative notes by Jeff Bond and John Takis . The expanded album [ <unk> <unk> ] runs 79 minutes and includes three tracks of alternates . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Frakes believes that the main themes of First Contact — and Star Trek as a whole — are loyalty , friendship , honesty and mutual respect . This is evident in the film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship with the rest of the crew . The film makes a direct comparison between Picard 's hatred of the Borg and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville 's novel Moby @-@ Dick . The moment marks a turning point in the film as Picard changes his mind , symbolized by his putting down his gun . A similar Moby @-@ Dick reference was made in Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , and although Braga and Moore did not want to repeat it , they decided it worked so well they could not leave it out . 
 In First Contact , the individually inscrutable and faceless Borg fulfill the role of the equally unreadable titular white whale in Melville 's work . Picard , like Ahab , has been hurt by his nemesis , and author Elizabeth Hinds said it makes sense that Picard should " opt for the perverse alternative of remaining on board ship to fight " the Borg rather than take the only sensible option left , to destroy the ship . Several lines in the film refer to the 21st @-@ century dwellers being primitive , with the people of the 24th century having evolved to a more utopian society . In the end it is Lily ( the 21st @-@ century woman ) who shows Picard ( the 24th @-@ century man ) that his quest for revenge is the primitive behavior that humans had evolved to not use . Lily 's words cause Picard to reconsider , and he quotes Ahab 's words of vengeance , recognizing the death wish embedded therein . 
 The nature of the Borg , specifically as seen in First Contact , has been the subject of critical discussion . Author Joanna Zylinska notes that while other alien species are tolerated by humanity in Star Trek , the Borg are viewed differently because of their cybernetic alterations and the loss of personal freedom and autonomy . Members of the crew who are assimilated into the Collective are subsequently viewed as " polluted by technology " and less than human . Zylinska draws comparisons between the technological distinction of humanity and machine in Star Trek and the work of artists such as <unk> . Oliver <unk> drew parallels between the Borg 's combination of many into an artificial One and Thomas Hobbes 's concept of the Leviathan . The nature of perilous first contact between species , as represented by films such as Independence Day , Aliens and First Contact , is a marriage of classic fears of national invasion and the loss of personal identity .

 1996 marked the 30th anniversary of the Star Trek franchise . First Contact was heavily marketed , to an extent not seen since the release of Star Trek : The Motion Picture in 1979 . Several novelizations of the film were written for different age groups . Playmates Toys produced six- and nine @-@ inch action figures in addition to ship models and a phaser . Two " making of " television specials premiered on HBO and the Sci @-@ Fi Channel , as well as being promoted during a 30th @-@ anniversary television special on UPN . The theatrical trailer to the film was included on a Best of Star Trek music compilation , released at the same time as the First Contact soundtrack . Simon & Schuster Interactive developed a Borg @-@ themed video game for Macintosh and Windows personal computers . The game , Star Trek : Borg , functioned as an interactive movie with scenes filmed at the same time as First Contact 's production . Paramount heavily marketed the film on the internet via a First Contact web site , which averaged 4 @.@ 4 million hits a week during the film 's opening run , the largest amount of traffic ever on a motion @-@ picture site . 
 The film premiered on November 18 , 1996 , at Mann 's Chinese Theater in Hollywood , Los Angeles . The main cast save Spiner were in attendance , as were Moore , Braga , Jerry Goldsmith , and producer Marty Hornstein . Other Star Trek actors present included DeForest Kelley , René Auberjonois , Avery Brooks , Colm Meaney , Armin Shimerman , Terry Farrell , Kate Mulgrew , Roxann Dawson , Jennifer Lien , Robert Duncan McNeill , Ethan Phillips , Tim Russ , Garrett Wang and Robert Picardo . After the screening , 1 @,@ 500 guests crossed the street to the Hollywood Colonnade , where the interiors had been dressed to match settings from the film : the holodeck nightclub , part of the bridge , a " star room " , the Borg hive and the " crash ' n ' burn lounge " . The film received a royal premiere in the United Kingdom , with the first screening attended by Charles , Prince of Wales .

 First Contact garnered positive reviews on release . Ryan Gilbey of The Independent considered the film wise to dispense with the cast of The Original Series : " For the first time , a Star Trek movie actually looks like something more ambitious than an extended TV show , " he wrote . Conversely , critic Bob Thompson felt that First Contact was more in the spirit of the 1960s television series than any previous installment . The Globe and Mail 's Elizabeth <unk> said that First Contact succeeded in improving on the " stilted " previous entry in the series , and that it featured a renewed interest in storytelling . Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote , " First Contact does everything you 'd want a Star Trek film to do , and it does it with cheerfulness and style . " Adrian Martin of The Age noted that the film was geared towards pleasing fans : " Strangers to this fanciful world first delineated by Gene Roddenberry will just have to struggle to comprehend as best they can , " he wrote , but " cult @-@ followers will be in heaven " . The New York Times ' Janet Maslin said that the " film 's convoluted plot will <unk> all but hard @-@ core devotees " of the series , while Variety 's Joe Leydon wrote that the film did not require intimate knowledge of the series and that fans and non @-@ fans alike would enjoy the film . While Renzetti considered the lack of old characters from the previous seven movies a welcome change , Maslin said that without the original stars , " The series now lacks [ ... ] much of its earlier determination . It has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative than it used to be , something the <unk> is never less likely to enjoy . " Conversely , Roger Ebert called First Contact one of the best Star Trek films , and James Berardinelli found the film the most entertaining Star Trek feature in a decade ; " It has single @-@ handedly revived the Star Trek movie series , at least from a creative point of view , " he wrote . 
 The film 's acting met with mixed reception . Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly appreciated that guest stars Woodard and Cromwell were used in " inventive contrast " to their better @-@ known images , as a " serious dramatic actress " and " dancing farmer in Babe " , respectively . Lloyd Rose of The Washington Post felt that while Woodard and Cromwell managed to " take care of themselves " , Frakes ' direction of other actors was not inspired ; Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times opined that only Cromwell received a choice role in the film , " so he steals the show by default " . A couple of reviews noted that Data 's interactions with the Borg Queen were among the most interesting parts of the film ; critic John Griffin credited Spiner 's work as providing " ambivalent frisson " to the feature . Empire magazine 's Adam Smith wrote that some characters , particularly Troi and Crusher , were lost or ignored , and that the rapid pacing of the film left no time for those unfamiliar with the series to know or care about the characters . Likewise , Emily Carlisle of the BBC praised Woodard 's , Spiner 's , and Stewart 's performances , but felt the film focused more on action than characterization . Stewart , whom Thompson and Renzetti considered overshadowed by William Shatner in the previous film , received praise from Richard Corliss of Time : " As Patrick Stewart delivers [ a ] line with a majestic ferocity worthy of a Royal Shakespeare Company alumnus , the audience gapes in awe at a special effect more imposing than any ILM digital doodle . Here is real acting ! In a Star Trek film ! " 
 The special effects were generally praised . Jay Carr of The Boston Globe said that First Contact successfully updated Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry 's concept with more elaborate effects and action . Thompson 's assessment mirrored Carr 's ; he agreed that the film managed to convey much of the original 1960s television show , and contained enough " special effects wonders and interstellar gunplay " to sate all types of viewers . Ebert wrote that while previous films had often looked " clunky " in the effects department , First Contact benefited from the latest in effects technology . A dissenting opinion was offered by Scott , who wrote that aside from the key effects sequences , Frakes " aims to distract <unk> from the distinctly cheap @-@ looking remainder " . 
 Critics reacted favorably to the Borg , describing them as akin to creatures from Hellraiser . Renzetti credited them with breathing " new life " into the crew of the Enterprise while simultaneously trying to kill them . The Borg Queen received special attention for her combination of horror and seduction ; Ebert wrote that while the Queen " looks like no notion of sexy I have ever heard of " , he was inspired " to keep an open mind " . Carr said , " She proves that women with filmy blue skin , lots of external tubing and bad teeth can be sleekly seductive . "

 = Ian Meckiff = 
 Ian Meckiff ( born 6 January 1935 ) is a former cricketer who represented Australia in 18 Tests between 1957 and 1963 . A left @-@ arm fast bowler , he is best known for two matters that were unrelated to his skill as a player : He was the batsman run out by Joe Solomon in 1960 , causing the first Tied Test in cricket history ; and in December 1963 , his career was sensationally ended when he was called for throwing in the First Test against South Africa by Australian umpire Col Egar . During the late 1950s and early 1960s , there had been a media frenzy about the perceived prevalence of illegal bowling actions in world cricket . The controversy and speculation that dogged Meckiff in the years preceding his final match caused sections of the cricket community to believe that he had been made a scapegoat by the Australian cricket authorities to prove their intent to stamp out throwing . 
 With an unconventional front @-@ on bowling action , Meckiff progressed through the district cricket ranks at South Melbourne Cricket Club , making his first @-@ class debut for Victoria in 1956 – 57 . After a productive first season , Meckiff was named in a new @-@ look Australian team for the 1957 – 58 tour of South Africa . This was the result of a generational change in the Australian Test team after a decline in performances in the 1950s . The shift saw Meckiff open the bowling in his debut Test , where he performed strongly to take eight wickets . Generating his pace from an unusual bent @-@ arm action which involved a flick of the wrist , Meckiff reached his peak in the Second Test of the 1958 – 59 season against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . He took 6 / 38 in the second innings as England were dismissed for 87 , setting up an Australian victory . His achievement was engulfed by controversy , as English media and former players accused him of throwing Australia to victory . 
 The controversy over Meckiff 's action persisted as throwing was in the spotlight in England , where it was regarded as a growing problem . The issue prompted numerous international discussions and meetings on amending the throwing law and the interpretation thereof . An expected confrontation with English umpires in 1961 was averted when the bowler suffered multiple injuries in the preceding Australian summer and was omitted from the team to tour England , but Meckiff had two strong seasons in domestic cricket that forced the Australian selectors to recall him for the Tests against South Africa in 1963 – 64 . The Victorian 's recall had occurred despite his being no @-@ balled for throwing in two separate Sheffield Shield matches in the previous season . In his first over of the Test , Meckiff was no @-@ balled four times by umpire Egar . Australian captain Richie Benaud chose to not bowl his paceman again , and Meckiff retired from all cricket at the end of the match . The throwing controversy provoked heavy debate among cricket commentators , players and umpires , past and present ; some praised Egar 's no @-@ ball call while others condemned the umpire and felt that the paceman had bowled in the same way as he had always done . Others felt that Meckiff had been set up so that he would be no @-@ balled in an " execution " or " sacrifice " to prove Australia 's resolve against throwing . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Meckiff was the second of three children born to Vera and Walter Meckiff ; he had an older brother Don and a younger sister Margaret . Growing up in the south @-@ eastern Melbourne suburb of Mentone , the children went to Mentone Primary School before progressing to <unk> @-@ Chelsea High School , where both brothers became prefects . All of the children represented their high school for sport — Don and Ian in athletics , swimming , football and cricket ; and Margaret in softball . The brothers played for Mentone Cricket Club in the Federal District Cricket Association , Ian as a left @-@ arm unorthodox spinner . He routinely dominated the opposition batsmen in the competition , taking 200 wickets at a bowling average of only 4 @.@ 50 during his career with Mentone . He began playing in Mentone 's under @-@ 16 team at the age of 11 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Having failed as a spin bowler in a trial at Richmond in 1950 , Meckiff switched to fast bowling in 1951 – 52 when he began his district career in Victorian Premier Cricket with South Melbourne . He started in the Fourth XI after his brother had to withdraw from a match . The following summer , aged 17 , Meckiff was in the senior team and played in South Melbourne 's first championship @-@ winning side in his debut season in the First XI , although his club career was sometimes interrupted by national service in the reserves . After receiving requests from cricket administrators , the military authorities scheduled the leave of young players for weekends , so that the impact on their careers would be minimised . At the time , Australia lacked bowlers of great pace , so a teammate advised Meckiff to bowl as fast as he could , without regard for accuracy — a plan he successfully adopted . 
 Meckiff made his first @-@ class debut for Victoria in 1956 – 57 against Western Australia . Coming in to bat with his state 's score at 8 wickets for 77 ( 8 / 77 ) , he made 19 not out to help them reach 131 , before taking three wickets for 45 runs ( 3 / 45 ) to restrict Western Australia to a 34 @-@ run first innings lead . His first wicket was future Australian captain Bob Simpson for a duck , and he followed up by removing Test batsmen Barry Shepherd and Ken Meuleman . Meckiff made 11 in the second innings and took 0 / 40 as Victoria lost by four wickets . 
 Meckiff 's most prominent showing in his debut season was in the Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales during the Christmas period of 1956 . At the time , the two states were by far the strongest in Australia ; in the past decade , the teams had 18 of the 20 top @-@ two Shield placings between them , and New South Wales were in the process of winning nine consecutive titles . The arch @-@ rivals were at full strength as no international matches were held during the season . 
 Coming in at 7 / 173 , Meckiff top @-@ scored with 55 — his only first @-@ class 50 — as Victoria batted first and made a late recovery to end with 244 . Meckiff took 3 / 65 , including the wickets of Test players Bill Watson and Richie Benaud as New South Wales responded with 281 . In the Victorian second innings Meckiff managed only 8 as Victoria left their opponents a target of 161 runs for victory . The paceman took 4 / 56 and claimed the final wicket , removing Test opener Jim Burke caught for 8 as New South Wales mustered 160 , causing the match to end in the first tie in Shield history . Burke had returned to bat after being injured earlier in the innings , while New South Wales captain Ian Craig , who had been ill , hauled himself out of bed in an attempt to salvage the match after his team had fallen to 7 / 70 . Meckiff 's other victims in the final innings included Test players Alan Davidson and Johnny Martin . 
 Strong showings for Victoria earned Meckiff selection in Neil Harvey 's XI for the one @-@ off match against Ray Lindwall 's XI at the start of January 1957 . These annual fixtures were used as trials for the leading players vying for national selection . Lindwall 's men batted first and made 428 ; Meckiff was the most successful bowler , taking 6 / 75 while his fellow @-@ bowlers struggled to make inroads into the opposition batsmen . His first wicket was Test batsman Ken Mackay for 99 , and he followed this by removing Bob Simpson , Norm O 'Neill and Graeme Hole in the middle @-@ order . Meckiff followed his productive bowling with 47 runs in a tail @-@ wagging performance , adding 71 for the eighth wicket with Wally Grout as Harvey 's men responded with 419 . The Victorian took 0 / 18 in the second innings as Lindwall 's team fell for 188 to leave Harvey 's XI with a victory target of 198 , which was achieved with seven wickets in hand . 
 Meckiff had performed strongly in his debut first @-@ class season , ending with 27 wickets at an average of 23 @.@ 66 . He was the ninth @-@ highest wicket @-@ taker for the Australian summer and his average was superior to all eight bowlers who took more wickets . At season 's end , he was rewarded with selection for Australia 's non @-@ Test tour of New Zealand in February and March 1957 . The hosts had Test status at the time , but Australia refused to ratify games against their trans @-@ Tasman neighbours as Test matches , citing the weakness of the New Zealand team . 
 The tour represented a changing of the guard in Australian cricket following the tour of England and the Indian subcontinent in 1956 , with the bowling line @-@ up heavily overhauled due to advancing age , injury and loss of form . Australia had lost three Ashes series in a row , and captain Ian Johnson and his deputy Keith Miller retired upon their return home . Johnson was Australia 's first @-@ choice spinner while Miller and the 35 @-@ year @-@ old Ray Lindwall had formed Australia 's new ball pairing for the previous decade . In addition , the fast bowling all rounder Ron Archer suffered a long @-@ term knee injury during the 1956 tour , while paceman Pat Crawford played only one first @-@ class match in 1956 – 57 after his marriage broke down . In the wake of Australia 's decline in the past five years , the selectors turned to youth in an attempt to rebuild the side , resting several established Test representatives from the side . Ian Craig was installed as the nation 's youngest ever captain at the age of 22 , having previously played only six Tests without securing a regular position in the team . 
 The New Zealand campaign was a chance for the younger players to establish themselves in the national team . Meckiff took 2 / 46 and 3 / 25 in his first @-@ class debut for Australia , an innings win over Otago . He played in the first match against New Zealand , but after taking 0 / 41 in a drawn encounter , he was dropped for the second game . The paceman forced his way back into the team for the third match after claiming 4 / 12 and 5 / 48 to help to set up an innings victory over Auckland . 
 In the final match , New Zealand batted first and Meckiff played a leading role in Australia 's victory , taking 4 / 28 from 27 @.@ 2 overs to help dismiss the hosts for 198 . The fast bowler was not required to bat as the tourists replied with 8 / 350 declared . He took 2 / 17 in the second innings as the home team fell for 161 before Craig 's men sealed the series with a 10 @-@ wicket win . Meckiff ended the tour with 20 first @-@ class wickets at 10 @.@ 85 , placing him top of the tour bowling averages . 
 = = Test debut = = 
 The following season , when the team for the 1957 – 58 South African tour was announced , Lindwall 's name was omitted , despite his 212 Test wickets , second only to Clarrie Grimmett among Australian bowlers . Meckiff was selected for the tour as part of Australia 's generational change , after a single season in first @-@ class cricket , and the squad departed for South Africa in October . On the tour , in five first @-@ class matches ahead of the Tests he took 12 wickets , at 26 @.@ 25 . 
 Meckiff was one of four Australians to make their debuts in the First Test , which was played on a batsman @-@ friendly surface in Johannesburg over the Christmas holiday period . Under some pressure due to Australia 's decision to discard Lindwall and invest in new talent , he opened the bowling alongside Alan Davidson , who up to that point had taken only 16 wickets at 34 @.@ 06 in 12 Tests . The match began badly for Australia 's inexperienced attack as the South African openers Jackie McGlew and Trevor Goddard put on an opening stand of 176 . Meckiff claimed his maiden Test wicket , and Australia 's first breakthrough , when he bowled Goddard for 90 . He then removed McGlew for 108 and later dismissed Russell Endean and Roy McLean for 50 apiece . South Africa amassed 470 , and Meckiff had the best figures , taking 5 / 125 in the hosts ' first innings , all five being specialist batsmen . When the tourists batted , Meckiff came in at 8 / 313 and held up his end as centurion Richie Benaud did the majority of the scoring in their 42 @-@ run partnership . The debutant ended with 11 in his first Test outing with the bat as Craig 's team ended on 368 . Meckiff took 3 / 52 in the South African second innings , including McGlew for the second time , as the match ended in a draw . This fine start to the Victorian 's international career was halted in the Second Test at Cape Town , where he broke down with injury early in the first innings and took no further part in an Australian innings victory . He did not take a wicket . 
 Meckiff missed the Third Test in Durban and spent a month on the sidelines , before returning against a combined team from Orange Free State and Border at the end of January . He took 6 / 29 in the first innings , his best return of the tour , and earned a recall for the final two Tests of the five @-@ match series . He was not as effective as he was on debut , taking two and one wickets for the matches respectively , and scoring 26 runs in his only innings of the Fourth Test . Overall , the Victorian paceman had made a steady start to his international career , with 11 Test wickets at an average of 32 @.@ 09 , and 56 runs at 18 @.@ 66 . In the entire tour , he took 33 first @-@ class wickets at 23 @.@ 09 . However , there was a hint of the controversy that was to end his career six years later . A year after the series , the South African Test umpire Bill Marais said he was prepared to no @-@ ball Meckiff and his team @-@ mate Jim Burke for throwing . There were reports that Craig had been tipped off about Marais 's intentions and therefore operated the two bowlers exclusively from the end at which Marais was not officiating . 
 = = Career peak and start of throwing controversy = = 
 The Victorian paceman 's international career peaked in 1958 – 59 during the English tour of Australia . He started the season with a match for Victoria against the tourists , taking 4 / 69 and 1 / 16 in a losing effort . His wickets included English Test batsmen Peter Richardson ( twice ) , Arthur Milton and Raman <unk> Row . 
 The Test team was now under the leadership of Benaud — Craig had been forced to withdraw from cricket due to hepatitis ; Meckiff retained his place in the side . Prior to the Tests , English all @-@ rounder Trevor Bailey privately described Meckiff as " the worst bowler ever to represent Australia " , and felt he posed little threat to the visitors . However this proved to be questionable . The Benaud era started well for Australia and Meckiff , with a comfortable eight @-@ wicket victory in the First Test in Brisbane . The paceman took 3 / 33 and 2 / 30 , removing Milton , Colin Cowdrey and captain Peter May early on the first day to help Australia take the initiative after the tourists had batted first . The match also marked the start of behind @-@ the @-@ scenes rumblings about the bowler 's action . 
 Meckiff 's career peaked at the Second Test , which began on New Year 's Eve , 1958 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . It was his first international fixture in front of his home crowd , and also marked the start of his career @-@ long public problem with accusations of throwing . The match was dominated by the Victorian and his left @-@ arm pace partner Davidson ; the pair took 18 of the 20 English wickets to fall . England 's first innings was headlined by Davidson 's 6 / 64 ; Meckiff took 3 / 69 , including the wicket of England captain May for 113 with a swinging ball , which breached the batsman 's defence and crashed into the stumps . This ended a century partnership with Cowdrey , and triggered a collapse that saw England be dismissed for 259 , the last six English wickets falling for 49 runs . Meckiff rated the ball as the best of his career . He made a duck as the hosts replied with 308 to take a 49 @-@ run lead . It was in England 's second innings that Australia 's left @-@ arm pacemen were at their most potent ; apart from one over from Benaud the pair bowled unchanged to dismiss England for 87 in the 32nd over , Meckiff taking 6 / 38 . Backed a by a vocal home crowd , the Victorian dismissed opener Richardson for three , before removing Bailey , Tom Graveney and Cowdrey in quick succession . He followed this by removing the English skipper for a second time to leave England at 7 / 71 . This set up a comfortable Australian victory as they reached their target of 39 with the loss of two wickets . The Australian pace duo were aided by a series of difficult , diving catches . The pair combined forces when Davidson caught May , and then Graveney , in the leg trap behind square from the bowling of his fellow left @-@ armer , who called the reflex catches " absolutely unbelievable " . Meckiff described the hometown atmosphere as " electrifying " , and attributed his performance to the crowd support . 
 The match ended on the eve of Meckiff 's 24th birthday , but Australian celebrations were marred by English journalists , who levelled accusations of throwing against him and some of his colleagues . The evening edition of the Melbourne Herald carried a column by former English spinner Johnny Wardle , accusing Meckiff of " throwing England out " . Wardle 's piece was written <unk> , as a series of sentences starting with " I accuse " . This was followed by more anti @-@ Meckiff comments in the English press , including one that dubbed the bowler " the greatest ogre of international cricket since Larwood " . The Evening News proclaimed : " Meckiff 's throwing was devastating " and The Star said : " at least two of his wickets were obtained by deliveries which looked to be thrown " . Former England spinner Ian Peebles asserted that Meckiff and Gordon Rorke threw " the greater number of balls they deliver " , while former English paceman Alf Gover claimed that none of the left @-@ armer 's deliveries were legal ; it was " ridiculous that a player of his action should be the agent of England 's destruction " . According to Australian writer Jack Pollard , such headlines relegated the Cold War , which usually occupied the front pages , to the interior of the English newspapers . 
 By contrast to the strident condemnation of Meckiff in the English press , Australian opinion was mixed . The former Test opener and leading commentator Jack Fingleton said : " when he [ Meckiff ] delivered to Bailey , his fastest ball looked most suspect " and that the left @-@ armer should have been called for throwing . Fingleton claimed to know of five former Australian Test cricketers who felt that Meckiff threw , but only named the 1930s paceman Ernie McCormick . Former Australian player Tommy Andrews claimed : " if they stop throwing in Australia , cricket will die " . Former Australian captain Ian Johnson argued that if Meckiff were to be cited for an illegal action for jerking his wrist , then leading English bowlers such as Trueman , Brian Statham and Tony Lock , who played against Australia during the season , should also be sanctioned . As with Meckiff , Lock was under scrutiny at the time and later tried to change his bowling action but the new style coincided with a downturn in results . Johnson also noted that any successful spinner would be called for throwing if the law were enforced strictly because of their flicking of the wrist and fingers during the delivery of the ball , as they could not otherwise extract spin . In 1993 , Robert Coleman , the historian of the Victorian Cricket Association , decried the anti @-@ Meckiff campaign as " Fleet Street bleating " , and said : " there have been no more hysterical outbursts on the subject [ of throwing ] than occurred during England 's 1958 – 59 tour " . Writing decades after the event , Pollard said " Meckiff , in fact , went to the crease with a beautifully relaxed approach , paused momentarily with his arm absolutely straight , and then let the ball go with a blurred swing of the arm that was impossible to follow from 60 yards away , even with the aid of good binoculars . " 
 Journalists who wrote books about the 1958 – 59 season made thinly veiled references to the controversy in the names of their work . Fingleton 's account on the series was entitled Four <unk> to Australia , while E. N. Wellings labelled his tome The Ashes Thrown Away , and accused Meckiff , along with Burke , Rorke and Keith Slater of throwing for Australia in the Tests . An Australian television debate program featured an entire session where English journalists Wellings and Crawford White discussed the throwing issue with former Australian Test cricketers Keith Miller and Sid Barnes . 
 In the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground Meckiff took one wicket — Bailey — in the first innings , before breaking down with an injury in the second . This ruled him out of the Fourth Test , and he missed a month of cricket before returning for the final Test in Melbourne in mid February , where he removed specialist batsmen May and Ted Dexter . On the field it had been a successful series for the Victorian ; he had taken 17 wickets at 17 @.@ 17 , as Australia claimed the series 4 – 0 . These efforts placed him top of the Test bowling averages for the series . When Lindwall was recalled for the Fourth Test in place of the injured Meckiff he was reported to have said " I 'm the last of the straight @-@ arm bowlers " . The veteran paceman played alongside Meckiff in later matches , including the Fifth Test . Meckiff was also prominent in the two Shield matches against New South Wales , when both teams were at full strength . In the first contest he had match figures of 5 / 129 , his victims including Test teammates Burke , O 'Neill and Davidson ( twice ) , but his efforts were unable to prevent defeat . In the return fixture , Meckiff took a total of 7 / 162 ; five of his victims were Australian Test batsmen . Victoria held the upper hand , and were 45 runs short of victory in the second innings when time ran out . 
 Within the wider cricket community there was a steady crescendo of comment condemning the prevalence of bowlers with suspect actions . Prior to the alteration of the bowling law by the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1960 , the law stated : 
 For a delivery to be fair , the ball must be bowled , not thrown or jerked ; if either umpire be not entirely satisfied of the absolute fairness of a delivery in this respect , he shall call and signal no @-@ ball instantly upon delivery . 
 = = = Reaction by players and officials = = = 
 In contrast to the heated debate in the media , players and administrators refrained from publicly questioning or condemning Meckiff . Neither the England captain May nor manager Freddie Brown raised any concerns about Meckiff 's action after the Test . However , it was later revealed that Brown had wanted to lodge an official complaint with the Australian Board of Control , but May had refused , fearing accusations of sour grapes . Years later , Richardson and some of his fellow batsmen accused the Australian fast bowler of throwing them out , while England paceman Fred Trueman said : " Meckiff 's action was totally illegal and that he should never have been allowed to play " . Richardson 's off spinning team @-@ mate Jim Laker likened Meckiff 's and Burke 's arm actions to those of dart @-@ throwers . 
 Benaud said he was " completely satisfied that [ Meckiff 's ] delivery was fair and legitimate " , while the selection panel of Don Bradman , Dudley Seddon and Jack Ryder continued to pick the paceman , implying that they regarded his action as legal . Bill Dowling , the chairman of the Australian Board of Control , denounced the media attention on suspect bowling actions as excessive and " magnified out of all proportion " . 
 Off the field , the throwing controversy was beginning to affect Meckiff adversely . In his 1961 autobiography , prophetically titled Thrown Out , he said the accusations took a deep personal toll on him and his family , and prompted him to shun the public . He became known by the derisive nickname " Chucker " and was credited on the front cover of his autobiography as " Ian ' Chucker ' Meckiff " . Meckiff reported that from the Melbourne Test onwards , his son was verbally abused by classmates ; Meckiff 's parents were persistently told their son bowled illegally . He added that doctors believed his anxiety was contributing to stomach ailments . At the time , players were not allowed to talk to the media during the season , and Meckiff was upset because he could not rebut his accusers while they were free to attack him . He denied ever throwing , but admitted he may have been open to suspicion after bowling 15 to 20 overs in a day 's play , as his body would begin to fall away in the delivery stride due to fatigue . He had a permanently bent bowling arm ; he generated his pace from his wrist action , and asserted that his thin wrists gave the impression that his whole arm was bending .

 In 1959 – 60 , the season started with a Test trial between the <unk> of Lindwall and Benaud . Meckiff claimed a match total of 4 / 90 for Lindwall 's men and was selected for the Test tour of Pakistan and India . Before the team departed , Meckiff demonstrated his new bowling action , which used a rigid left arm during the run @-@ up , before swinging the arm over during the delivery stride . Over the next two years , sceptics and sporting opponents mostly regarded his action as fair , and said so in public . He was not called for throwing in either India or Pakistan , meaning that he had played in five nations without being sanctioned . 
 Meckiff was wicketless in Australia 's win in the First Test against Pakistan on a matting wicket in Dacca ( now in Bangladesh ) . In the first innings of the Second Test in Lahore , he took three wickets , including that of opposition captain Hanif Mohammad ; the match was Australia 's last Test win on Pakistani soil for 39 years . Before the Third Test , he helped the tourists beat the President 's XI in a low @-@ scoring game in which none of the four innings totalled over 140 . Meckiff claimed four wickets in the match , and was batting ( he scored two not out ) when Australia reached their victory target with three wickets in hand . He missed the drawn Third Test in Karachi . 
 In the next leg of the tour , Meckiff returned to the Australian side for the First Test against India in Delhi . After claiming 1 / 52 in the first innings , he compiled his Test best score of 45 not out . He came in to bat with his team 's score at 8 / 402 and helped Lindsay Kline and Rorke push Australia 's score to 468 , a first innings lead of 333 . Meckiff was unable to capture a wicket in the Indian second innings as Benaud 's men won by an innings and 117 runs . He bowled with little success in the Second Test in Kanpur , taking 1 / 52 in a spin @-@ dominated match in which <unk> Patel claimed 14 wickets to bowl India to their first @-@ ever Test win over Australia . Meckiff was unbeaten on 14 when India secured the final wicket . In his first two Tests on Indian soil , Meckiff 's only victim had been Chandu Borde , whom he dismissed twice . 
 Meckiff 's most successful Test during the Indian tour was the drawn third match at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay , where he captured 4 / 79 and 3 / 67 . In the Indian first innings , after removing opener Nari Contractor for 108 , Meckiff captured four of the next five wickets as India collapsed from 3 / 199 to 8 / 246 — they were eventually all out for 289 . In the second innings he secured three quick wickets as the hosts slumped from 0 / 99 to 4 / 116 before a recovery which prevented their defeat . Meckiff continued to hold the upper hand over Borde , dismissing him in both innings . The Victorian bowler had little success in the final two Tests , taking only three wickets as Australia won the series 2 – 1 . He ended the subcontinental tour with 15 wickets at 35 @.@ 73 , and scored 70 runs at 23 @.@ 33 . He had particular success against Borde , dismissing him five times in as many Tests . Meckiff returned to Australia in time to play his solitary Sheffield Shield match for the 1959 – 60 season , taking the only ten @-@ wicket match haul of his career . He took 5 / 41 and 5 / 84 to set up an easy win over Western Australia . His first innings effort helped dismiss Western Australia for 141 , and Victoria replied with 431 to move into a match @-@ winning position . He also helped South Melbourne to another district title , taking 9 / 51 — including a hat @-@ trick — in the last match of the regular season against Fitzroy . This victory allowed South Melbourne to climb from seventh to fourth in the table and become the last qualifier for the semi @-@ finals . They subsequently won their semi @-@ final and the grand final to secure the title . 
 = = Alterations to the throwing law = = 
 In 1960 , at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference in London , cricket 's " throwing law " was changed to forbid the straightening of the arm at the instant of the ball 's delivery . The Australian Board of Control were so concerned about the controversy and its possible impact on the Australian game that they sent Board chairman Dowling and Board member Sir Donald Bradman to the meeting , rather than the customary Britain @-@ based representative . Despite the agreed change in the law , because of conflicting interpretations in different countries a compromise was agreed , which specified an amnesty during the forthcoming 1961 Australian tour to England . It was agreed that on the tour , umpires would privately report any concerns about bowling actions to the teams concerned , for them to remedy . After the tour , umpires would " call " bowlers whenever they felt the new law to have been breached . 
 On his return to Australia Dowling angrily accused the English cricket community of pre @-@ judging Meckiff . Dowling said the strident press attacks on Meckiff had amounted to intimidation of umpires through the media , and claimed that some administrators had privately told him that the Australian paceman would be called if he toured England . The president of the Marylebone Cricket Club , Sir Hubert Ashton , said he hoped Australia would not choose Meckiff for their 1961 tour . 
 = = Tied Test against the West Indies , 1960 – 61 = = 
 The Victorian was not called during the 1960 – 61 Australian season , but his performances were ineffective and he was repeatedly hampered by injuries . In particular , a strained achilles tendon restricted his speed and penetration , particularly in the lead @-@ up to the opening Test . Meckiff played in the First and the Third Tests , taking two wickets at 117 @.@ 00 and scoring 12 runs at 6 @.@ 00 ; he was unable to complete either match , sustaining injuries during the second innings of both fixtures . These fitness problems resulted in his omission for the three other Tests . During the summer , Meckiff 's bowling was passed by Col Egar , who later ended his career . He noted that the umpire had told him there was little point in changing his action . 
 Meckiff took match figures of 4 / 90 as Victoria started the season with a nine @-@ wicket win over South Australia , but he managed only 2 / 122 as his state lost by an innings to the touring West Indies in the next fixture . The paceman removed Rohan Kanhai , who made 252 of the visitors ' 493 , and captain Frank Worrell , who contributed 82 . During the heavy defeat , Meckiff equal top @-@ scored with 24 not out in the first innings , as the hosts struggled against the mysterious spin of Sonny Ramadhin . Despite his unpenetrative performance with the ball , the paceman was retained for the First Test in Brisbane . The Caribbean team batted first and attacked Meckiff , taking more than seven runs per over from his bowling . The paceman ended with 1 / 129 from 18 overs as the visitors amassed 453 ; his only wicket was that of Gary Sobers for 132 . The West Indian batsman had been particularly severe on Meckiff and was ironically dismissed by " the day 's worst ball " — a leg side full toss that he hit to mid @-@ on . In the second innings , Meckiff broke down after only four overs , but came out to bat on 14 December , late in Australia 's climactic run @-@ chase , for which he was often remembered . At the end of a dramatic final day , Australia needed seven runs from the final over for victory , and they had three wickets in hand . The home side had seemed destined for a win after Davidson and Benaud had fought back with a century stand for the seventh wicket in the final session . Both were well set and had passed 50 , but the tourists halted Australia 's momentum by running out Davidson with a direct hit from the last ball of the previous over . Benaud was caught behind on the second ball of the final over attempting a hook and Meckiff came to the crease to join Wally Grout . Five runs were needed from six balls with two wickets in hand . 
 The injured paceman blocked the first ball he faced — the third of the over — and ran a bye after missing the next . The West Indian wicket @-@ keeper tried to run Meckiff out , but missed the stumps at the non @-@ striker 's end with the batsman many metres out of his ground . Grout top @-@ edged the following ball straight up into the air , but the two fielders who converged beneath it collided and dropped the catch , allowing the Australians to take another run . The hosts thus needed three runs from the last three balls . Meckiff faced the sixth ball ; it was a half volley and he lofted it over square leg . The ball looked as though it would reach the boundary for a match @-@ winning four runs ; however , after landing close to the fence , it stopped rolling a metre short on the slow outfield . Grout attempted a third run , which would have won the match , but an accurate long throw saw him run out . The last man Lindsay Kline came in for the final two balls , with scores level , and the Australian pair agreed to run under all circumstances . Meckiff backed up significantly in anticipation of a quick single , and set off for the winning run after his partner hit the ball to square leg . However , he was run out by roughly a metre when Joe Solomon directly hit the stumps from side on , causing the first tie in Test history . Umpire Col Hoy said of his decision to give Meckiff out : " God , it was easy . He was miles out . " The entire stadium — players and spectators alike — invaded the ground in excitement , but nobody was sure of the exact scores . It was only later that they realised the match was the first Tied Test ; Meckiff initially thought Australia had lost and blamed himself for the result . 
 After missing the Australian victory in the Second Test due to injury , Meckiff returned for the Third Test and he was again attacked , taking 1 / 74 from 13 overs in the first innings , his sole victim being Conrad Hunte . He then broke down after five overs in the second innings . Davidson also left the field with injury and the tourists took advantage ; they attacked the remaining bowlers , levelling the series 1 – 1 . The Victorian did not recover in time for the rest of the Tests . 
 <unk> hampered by ankle and back injuries , Meckiff aggregated only 19 first @-@ class wickets at 40 for the summer . His best innings performance was 4 / 39 against Queensland and he was unable to claim more than five wickets in any single match . In one match against arch @-@ rivals New South Wales , the Victorian took a total of 5 / 155 , all of his wickets being Test batsmen . Meckiff was not selected for the Ashes tour . His lack of form saved the Australian selectors the difficult choice of whether to omit him because of his action and avoid a potential run @-@ in with umpires in England . Critics claimed that his new bowling action adopted in 1959 – 60 had made him legitimate but reduced his pace and effectiveness . 
 = = No @-@ balled in the Sheffield Shield , 1962 – 63 = = 
 The throwing controversy subsided during the 1961 English season , and the 1961 – 62 Australian season was purely domestic , with no touring international teams . As a result , there were no pressing diplomacy imperatives involving throwing . Meckiff was Victoria 's leading bowler with 28 wickets at 27 @.@ 14 in eight matches and was not called . His best performance was 5 / 53 in the first innings of the match against Queensland at the MCG , which ended in defeat for the home team . Despite healthy results for the season overall , the paceman struggled and took match figures of 2 / 136 and 3 / 112 as Victoria lost both their matches against the dominant New South Wales XI , who won their ninth successive Shield . At the end of the season , Meckiff was part of an International XI that toured New Zealand and played against the hosts ' national team and against teams from India and Pakistan . He had little success , taking four wickets at 53 @.@ 00 in three matches . 
 In 1962 – 63 , Meckiff was again under the spotlight when Ted Dexter 's Englishmen toured Australia . He topped the bowling averages for the Australian first @-@ class season with 58 wickets at 19 @.@ 86 from ten matches , as Victoria won the Sheffield Shield , ending New South Wales ' run of titles . Meckiff and Alan Connolly formed an effective pace pairing , helping Victoria to win four of its eight Shield games , and take first innings points in two others . 
 Meckiff was hoping to regain his Test place , and started his 1962 – 63 campaign in a Sheffield Shield match against South Australia . After Victoria made 174 , the paceman took 4 / 65 to dismiss South Australia for 141 in the first innings . In the second innings he took 3 / 76 to help seal a win . He continued his early season form in taking match figures of 7 / 179 against Western Australia , but was unable to prevent defeat . Despite these performances , Meckiff was overlooked for the First Test . He had another chance to vie for national selection when Victoria played England after the opening Test , and took match figures of 4 / 90 as the tourists completed a five @-@ wicket victory . He dismissed Ray Illingworth , Geoff <unk> and Alan Smith as Victoria took a four @-@ run first innings lead , but the hosts collapsed in their second innings and Dexter 's men reached their target of 180 with five wickets in hand . 
 Victoria then played the first of their two matches for the season against their arch @-@ rivals New South Wales , just before the Second Test . Meckiff took 3 / 33 , removing Grahame Thomas , Benaud and Martin as Victoria dismissed the reigning champions for 132 . He contributed 32 runs at the end of the Victorian first innings reply , helping to extend his team 's first @-@ innings lead to 135 runs . In the New South Wales second innings Meckiff took 3 / 73 , removing Test players Simpson , Davidson and Benaud , to leave his team with a target of 95 runs to win , which they reached with eight wickets in hand . 
 Despite this effort , he was not selected for the Second Test . His season was then marred when he was called for throwing for the first time in any competition . In January 1963 , Victoria played South Australia at the Adelaide Oval . After Victoria had made 218 , Meckiff removed both openers — Les Favell and Ken Cunningham — for the cost of 19 runs before Jack <unk> no @-@ balled the fourth ball of his fourth over . He continued to bowl ; his remaining deliveries were deemed legal by the umpires , and he ended with 5 / 84 in South Australia 's reply of 8 / 408 declared . The hosts had a target of only 108 in the second innings for victory , but Meckiff removed Favell , Cunningham and Neil <unk> with the new ball to destabilise the run @-@ chase . He ended with 3 / 25 as the South Australians stumbled to 7 / 86 and held on for a draw . 
 Meckiff took a total of 3 / 50 in a seven @-@ wicket defeat of Western Australia before the return match against New South Wales , in which Victoria were 34 runs short of victory with seven wickets in hand when time ran out , Meckiff 's match figures being 6 / 121 . He had a final chance to push for Test selection in the second of his state 's two matches against England . The tourists batted first and made 375 ; Meckiff took 5 / 93 , dismissing <unk> , Peter Parfitt , Fred Titmus , David Allen and top @-@ scorer Tom Graveney , who had made 185 . He took 2 / 47 in the English second innings , removing Barry Knight and Ken Barrington . England set Victoria 287 for victory , and the hosts faced defeat before Meckiff batted late in the order to score 38 and help his side to a draw with one wicket in hand . Despite this continued run of prolific wicket @-@ taking and his success against England , Meckiff was overlooked for the Fifth Test . In his absence , Australia struggled to make inroads into the English batting , and the series ended 1 – 1 . 
 Victoria 's season ended with consecutive matches against Queensland . In the first , Meckiff took a total of 5 / 88 as his side completed an innings victory at home . In the final match in Brisbane , his slower ball was no @-@ balled in his fifth over of the second innings by umpire Bill <unk> . Meckiff bowled 14 further overs without incident and ended the innings with 4 / 74 . Victoria drew the match and sealed their Sheffield Shield victory . Meckiff had been the state 's leading wicket @-@ taker and one of the key figures in their triumph , but his bowling action was the main talking point at the end of the match . 
 = = Test no @-@ ball = = 
 Meckiff 's performances as the leading wicket @-@ taker during the 1962 – 63 season meant that he could not be justifiably denied national selection on grounds of productivity , so the matter of his legitimacy had to be resolved . Meanwhile , the retirement of pace spearhead Davidson left a vacancy in the Australian team ahead of the 1963 – 64 home Test series against South Africa . In the opening Shield matches of the season in Melbourne , Meckiff took match figures of 5 / 102 and 6 / 107 against South and Western Australia respectively . His wickets included Test batsmen Les Favell , Garry Sobers , Keith Slater and Barry Shepherd . In the latter match he took the first five wickets in the innings to reduce Western Australia to 5 / 54 . Despite his contributions , Victoria were unable to secure victories against either of their opponents . However , as a result of these strong personal performances , Meckiff was selected for the First Test in Brisbane . 
 At the start of the season , the Australian Board of Control had issued a directive calling on the umpires to " get tough " in enforcing the laws of cricket , and asked the state associations to " back the umpires to the fullest extent " . In the lead @-@ up to the Test , Meckiff was the centre of media attention , and one report described him as cricket 's " bogey man " . The South Africans were reportedly stunned by Meckiff 's selection , giving the impression that they considered him an illegitimate bowler . Reaction in England was also hostile , ahead of Australia 's forthcoming tour in the English summer of 1964 . Colin Ingleby @-@ Mackenzie wrote in the News of the World : " there is no room in cricket for throwers . Let us hope that ... the Australian selectors realise this ... otherwise the throwing war will be waged in earnest " . 
 The Brisbane Test was dubbed " Meckiff 's Test " by the Australian media ; speculation abounded that the bowler was being chosen so he could be no @-@ balled as a public relations effort to promote Australia 's anti @-@ throwing credentials . Keith Miller described the left @-@ armer 's selection as having " peppered this once drab @-@ looking series into a curry hot @-@ pot , with all the excitement and trimmings of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller " . Miller further predicted that the umpires Egar and Lou Rowan would be having sleepless nights and predicted that the selectors would be biting their fingernails , adding that he hoped Meckiff was not being used as a scapegoat for the anti @-@ throwing movement . Former Test leg spinner Bill O 'Reilly — a correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald — described the selection as " one of the most fantastic somersaults in cricket policies in our time " . As a close friend of the fast bowler , umpire Egar was in a difficult situation ; the duo had won a pairs lawn bowling competition just a few months earlier . Nevertheless , the paceman and umpire socialised freely at the pre @-@ match function . 
 = = = Incident = = = 
 In the Test match , which began on 6 December 1963 , Australia batted first ; Meckiff contributed seven runs before being bowled by Peter Pollock . On the second day , after the Australian innings ended on 435 , South Africa began to bat just after the luncheon interval . Bowling from the Stanley Street End , Graham McKenzie conceded 13 runs from the first over . Meckiff took the ball for the second over , bowling from the Vulture Street End to South African captain Trevor Goddard . At the same time , the South African manager Ken Viljoen set up a camera square of the wicket among the spectators and began filming the left @-@ armer 's bowling action . Meckiff was no @-@ balled four times by Egar — who was standing at square leg — in what would be his only over of the match . After the Victorian bowled a gentle " <unk> " as his first ball ( and escaped a front @-@ foot no @-@ ball call ) , " the drama began " . Egar ruled the second , third , fifth and ninth balls to be throws , and therefore illegitimate . After the third and fifth balls — the latter a full toss that Goddard hit for four — Benaud came over to consult his fast bowler . After the ninth ball , Meckiff and Benaud had another meeting , and the remaining three balls were deemed to be fair . In the meantime , the crowd roared loudly , heckling Egar and supporting the beleaguered bowler . Meckiff had previously been passed in five countries , having played Tests in four of these nations . Egar had cleared his bowling on five previous occasions , in three Shield matches and two Tests ; the Victorian had bowled 119 @.@ 1 overs in these games without incident . Egar later said " My only judgement was what I saw at the time " . Benaud removed his paceman from the attack and Meckiff did not bowl again in the match , later saying he could not remember the over because he was absorbed by a feeling of complete deflation . 
 Meckiff conceded eight runs — Goddard 's boundary and the four no @-@ balls — from his solitary over and the tourists were eventually out for 346 . Meckiff did not bat in the second innings of the weather @-@ interrupted match ; Australia declared at 1 / 144 before South Africa reached 1 / 13 when the match ended as a draw . After his single over , Meckiff 's participation in the match was limited to his fielding , during which he caught Goddard from the bowling of Benaud in the South African first innings . He retired from all forms of cricket at the end of the game , but continued to proclaim that his bowling action was fair . 
 Barry Gibbs , the secretary of the Queensland Cricket Association and the manager of the Australian team , called the " humiliation " of Meckiff " without a doubt the most dramatic and emotion @-@ charged " sporting moment he had witnessed . Egar 's actions also ignited " one of the most emotional crowd displays in Test history " , as the public backed the paceman . During Meckiff 's over , the crowd expressed strong disapproval of the umpire 's calls . Half an hour before the close of the day 's play , proceedings were suspended for two minutes as the crowd repeatedly chanted " We want Meckiff " . When play ended , spectators stormed the field and carried the fast bowler off the arena on their shoulders , hailing him as a hero . They returned to the field and formed two lanes , booing Egar from the ground . After this incident , the Queensland Police escorted the umpire to and from the match venue . The police presence at the ground was increased because of fears the crowd might attack Egar or Benaud . During the Second Test , which was held in Meckiff 's home town of Melbourne , Egar was given a police escort throughout the match after receiving death threats . 
 = = = Reaction = = = 
 During a rest day after the second day 's play the media dissected the events of the previous afternoon . The majority of reporters believed all of Meckiff 's deliveries had been bowled with an identical action . Louis Duffus of the Johannesburg Star expressed " sympathy for Meckiff as well as admiration for Egar . " The South African writer Charles Fortune said that Meckiff 's action was " not according to the laws of cricket " although he would not call the Australian bowler a " <unk> " . England captain Dexter implicitly accused Meckiff of throwing , saying : " One courageous Australian umpire has brought it to a timely end " . 
 Team manager Gibbs reported that at the end of the first day 's play the Australian dressing room was stunned into silence . Egar asked Benaud for permission to enter , and after the Australian captain allowed him in , the umpire sat quietly for a period before speaking to some other players and then to Meckiff . The pair were close friends , and shook hands before putting their arms around one another 's shoulders . The condemned bowler did not take Egar 's judgment personally and did not have hard feelings about the incident . Egar claimed to be " the second most upset person in the world " , and later added that he thought Meckiff 's first ball was suspect . He said that he could have called more deliveries , but was worried whether the over would ever end . 
 When asked why he had not asked Meckiff to bowl at the other end to gauge the judgment of the other umpire , Lou Rowan , Benaud replied " over the years I have always accepted the umpire 's decision " . The Australian captain was criticised for being acquiescent , and one of his predecessors Lindsay Hassett believed Meckiff should have been used at reduced speed . Rowan later indicated his concurrence with Egar , writing in his book The Umpire 's Story , " There is nothing I can now say that will alter the opinions already expressed that his [ Meckiff 's ] delivery was unfair " . For his part , Meckiff said : " the game is bigger than the individual " and he backed Benaud 's decision because doing otherwise " could only have added fuel to the controversy " . 
 Retired Test umpires Col Hoy and Les Townsend were watching at the ground when Meckiff was called . The day after the incident , both asserted that they would not have no @-@ balled the paceman . Hoy said he had never had any problem with the bowler 's action during matches in which he officiated . He described Meckiff 's action as " slightly different " but attributed this to an accentuated wrist action used in an attempt to get more life out of dead pitches , rather than his elbow . Townsend watched the paceman through binoculars and deemed all of his 12 deliveries to be identical . Townsend regarded Meckiff 's arm action as " peculiar " but felt he did not throw . Former Test spinners Ian Johnson and Doug Ring said Meckiff 's action was fair . 
 After his retirement , Meckiff agreed to put his name to a series of ghost @-@ written articles about the no @-@ ball incident . He said that Egar 's calls " hit him like a dagger in the back " , but described the umpire as " a fair and just man who acted according to his convictions " . 
 = = = Allegations of a conspiracy = = = 
 Sections of the cricket community believed Meckiff was no @-@ balled to prove that Australia was serious about dealing with the wave of complaints regarding suspected throwing in the 1950s and 1960s . Leading cricket historian David Frith wrote : " Meckiff was a popular Australian , and won much sympathy among those who believed him innocent or to have been victimised in a ' clean @-@ up campaign ' . " A dinner hosted by Don Bradman at his Adelaide home in January 1963 for visiting state captains was later cited to suggest that Meckiff may have been a sacrificial offering . At the dinner , attended by Bill Lawry of Victoria , Barry Shepherd , Ken Mackay and Benaud , Bradman had showed frame @-@ by @-@ frame slow motion film of Meckiff and other suspect Australian bowlers , which purportedly depicted incriminating actions . This indicated Bradman 's doubts over Meckiff 's legitimacy , yet Bradman was one of the selectors who agreed to the bowler 's inclusion in the Brisbane Test team . 
 Many members of the Australian media alleged a conspiracy against Meckiff . Ian McDonald of Melbourne 's Sporting Globe said the bowler 's action had not changed in the previous eight years and stated : " the whole affair smacks of a set @-@ up " . Sydney 's Mirror labelled the paceman " the most obvious fall @-@ guy in Australian cricket history " . On the third morning of the match , former first @-@ class cricketer Percy Beames , writing for Melbourne 's The Age , claimed Meckiff had been used as a " sacrificial goat " and called for the selectors ' resignation . Keith Miller wrote a column calling for Bradman 's and Jack Ryder 's removal from the selection panel , noting that they had watched Meckiff 's performance against Western Australia which prompted his Test selection . Miller felt that if the selectors deemed the bowler illegitimate , then they should not have allowed him to be " executed " by the umpires . Jack Pollard said : " there is little doubt Meckiff was sacrificed to end the long @-@ running controversy and the way it was done irked many cricket @-@ lovers . " Cricketer @-@ turned @-@ journalist Dick Whitington asserted that Benaud was aware his fast bowler had been set up , claiming that the Australian captain knew of Bradman 's views on Meckiff 's action . Whitington further cited the fact that Egar and Bradman had travelled from Adelaide to the Brisbane Test together as evidence of a plot . Others saw Bradman 's tea @-@ time conversation with Benaud after the no @-@ balling as proof of a conspiracy . Benaud repudiated allegations claiming he was involved in a set @-@ up . 
 Former Australian captain Hassett hinted at a conspiracy when he stated that , as the selectors must have considered Meckiff to be legitimate , then 
 If the selectors are right , Egar is wrong , and if he is incapable of interpreting the laws correctly , he should not stand in first @-@ class cricket . On the other hand if the selectors as a body threw Meckiff into this arena merely to be tested by the opinion of a single umpire , they are very much guilty of passing the buck , and of exposing both the bowler and the umpire to extreme embarrassment . 
 The records of the Australian Board of Control attest to board member Clem Jones 's protestations against Meckiff 's inclusion when the selectors ' proposed team list was submitted for approval . Jones cited the bowler 's questionable action but the Chairman Ewart Macmillan rejected his objection as unconstitutional . Two other board members attempted to overrule the chairman , but their motion was defeated . 
 More than 40 years after the Meckiff incident , Jones was sure the bowler 's fate had been predetermined . He said " They 'd decided to do it a week before the game , so the poor bloke had no hope ... I was chairman of the umpires selection committee . " Jones remained convinced of Bradman 's intention to have Meckiff called for throwing , something Bradman flatly denied . Gibbs remains suspicious of the motives for selecting Meckiff . He pointed out that although the pitch was conducive to spin bowling , Australia chose five specialist batsmen , two spinners and three fast bowlers . Gibbs speculated that the selection of an extra fast bowler — the most common strategy is to use four bowlers and six batsmen — instead of another batsman betrayed fears that Meckiff would be unable to complete the match . Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate 's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy , saying " I wasn 't amazed [ by Egar 's call ] ... There was a good reason for that which I can 't disclose and won 't disclose . " Tom <unk> , who made his Test debut for Australia in Meckiff 's last match , hinted at the same . He recalled Rowan 's words at the pre @-@ match function : " It 's going to be a very interesting game " . 
 = = Outside cricket = = 
 After finishing high school , Meckiff worked as a hardware salesman and lived in Mentone until he married and moved to Beaumaris . The couple had a son . After his retirement , the former paceman worked in advertising , and as a cricket commentator . As of 2001 , he was a senior executive with Boyer Sports Media and frequently worked with cricket administrators . However , he refused to play the sport — even at social level — after the incident in Brisbane . 
 Meckiff played Australian rules football for Mentone in the Federal League , helping them win the premiership in 1956 . He received offers to play in the Victorian Football League , the top @-@ tier competition at the time , but declined contracts so he could pursue his cricket career . Meckiff also played golf in pennant competition and captained the Victoria Golf Club . 
 In retirement , the throwing issue continued to dog the former paceman . Former Australian captain and teammate Simpson wrote a book titled Captain 's Story in which he assailed various cricketers — Meckiff chief among them — for throwing . Meckiff sued for libel in a five @-@ year case , which ended with an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement and apology from Simpson . Despite this , Meckiff has continued to socialise with people involved in his last Test , including Simpson , Egar , Gibbs , Rowan and Peter van der <unk> , South Africa 's vice @-@ captain . He says that he never brings up the topic of the no @-@ ball with them . Victorian and Test teammate Lawry rated Meckiff " along with Graham McKenzie , Brian Booth , Peter Burge and one or two others as really nature 's gentlemen " and said his exit was " one of the saddest [ days ] of [ Lawry 's ] life " . Lawry credited his fellow Victorian for being dignified despite the torment and said the bowler was a " pretty fair example of the old expression that good guys run last " . Connolly said " ' <unk> ' was one of the nicest guys . It was to his great credit that he wasn 't soured by the whole incident . " 
 = Black dogfish = 
 The black dogfish ( Centroscyllium fabricii ) is a species of dogfish shark in the family Etmopteridae . It is common over the outer continental shelf and continental slope at depths of 180 – 2 @,@ 250 m ( 590 – 7 @,@ 380 ft ) . Females generally inhabit deeper water than males , and depending on the region , smaller sharks may occur at different depths than larger ones . This species is distributed widely in the Atlantic Ocean , from Greenland and Iceland to Virginia and West Africa in the north , and off southwestern Africa and Argentina in the south . The largest member of its family , the black dogfish , typically measures 60 – 75 cm ( 24 – 30 in ) long . It has a stocky , dark brown body that is darker below than above , and bears scattered , minute bioluminescent organs . Its two dorsal fins are preceded by stout spines , and the anal fin is absent . 
 Active and schooling , the black dogfish is an opportunistic predator and scavenger that mainly consumes bony fishes , crustaceans , and cephalopods . It is aplacental viviparous , with females producing litters of four to 40 pups that are sustained to term by a yolk sac . There is no well @-@ defined breeding season , and mating and birthing take place year @-@ round . The black dogfish contributes significantly to the bycatch of deep @-@ sea commercial fisheries operating in the North Atlantic ; it is of little commercial value and is usually discarded . As large portions of its range see little deepwater fishing activity and its northwestern Atlantic population seems to be stable , the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species under Least Concern overall . It has been assessed as Near Threatened in the northeastern Atlantic , where its numbers may have declined from heavy fishing pressure . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The first known specimen of the black dogfish was collected near <unk> in Greenland and described by Danish zoologist Johannes Reinhardt in his 1825 <unk> <unk> . Reinhardt gave it the name <unk> fabricii in honor of missionary and naturalist Otto Fabricius , who pioneered the study of Greenlandic fishes . German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle , in their 1839 – 41 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen , created the new genus Centroscyllium for this species . 
 According to the IUCN , further taxonomic investigation is required to confirm the black dogfish in the North Atlantic and the southeastern Atlantic represent the same species . A 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues , based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA , found the black dogfish is the sister species of the whitefin dogfish ( C. <unk> ) , and the two are , in turn , sister to the clade formed by the granular dogfish ( C. <unk> ) and combtooth dogfish ( C. nigrum ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The black dogfish is a common species , with a wide but discontinuous distribution in the temperate waters of the Atlantic Ocean ; its range abuts , but does not extend into , the Arctic Ocean . In the northeast , it occurs from Iceland to Sierra Leone , including the Faroe Islands , southern Norway , and the Rockall Trough and Porcupine Seabight off Ireland . In the northwest , it is found from southern Greenland and Baffin Island to Virginia , being particularly abundant in the Laurentian Channel , and may occur further south to the Gulf of Mexico off Alabama . In the southeast , it is found off Namibia and South Africa as far as Cape Agulhas . In the southwest , it has been recorded from the Beagle Channel at the southern tip of Argentina . 
 Inhabiting the outer continental shelf and continental slope , the black dogfish is found mostly near the bottom in water 180 – 2 @,@ 250 m ( 590 – 7 @,@ 380 ft ) deep . It is most common at depths of 800 – 1 @,@ 200 m ( 2 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 900 ft ) off Iceland , 1 @,@ 250 – 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 100 – 4 @,@ 920 ft ) in the Rockall Trough , 500 – 1 @,@ 300 m ( 1 @,@ 600 – 4 @,@ 300 ft ) off Greenland , 350 – 500 m ( 1 @,@ 150 – 1 @,@ 640 ft ) off northern Canada , and below 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) off southern Africa . The species may venture closer to the surface in the northern extreme of its range , particularly during the dark , cold winter months . Depth segregation by sex has been documented in the North Atlantic , with females outnumbering males at depths greater than 1 km ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) . Depth segregation by size varies by region : larger sharks are generally found in deeper water off western Greenland , in shallower water off western Iceland , and without pattern with respect to depth off eastern Iceland . The black dogfish prefers water temperatures of 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 ° C ( 38 @.@ 3 – 40 @.@ 1 ° F ) , though off northern Canada , it is most abundant in water of 5 – 6 @.@ 5 ° C ( 41 @.@ 0 – 43 @.@ 7 ° F ) ; it can tolerate temperatures down to 1 ° C ( 34 ° F ) . There is some evidence that this species conducts seasonal migrations , spending winter and spring in shallower water . Sharks off northern Canada perform development @-@ related movements ( see below ) not observed off western Greenland , suggesting the presence of two distinct stocks in the northwestern Atlantic . 
 = = Description = = 
 Adult black dogfish typically measure 60 – 75 cm ( 24 – 30 in ) in length and can reach 1 @.@ 1 m ( 3 @.@ 6 ft ) , making it the largest member of its family . Females attain a larger ultimate size than males . The shark has a rather stocky and laterally compressed body , with a moderately long , thick , and flattened snout that forms a very broad arch at the front . The sizable , horizontally oval eyes are a reflective green in life and lack nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) ; they are followed a short distance behind by much smaller spiracles ( accessory <unk> openings ) . The nostrils are anteriorly placed and preceded by short flaps of skin . The mouth is wide and evenly arched , with thin lips and short but deep furrows around the corners . There are around 34 tooth rows in either side of both jaws ; each tooth has three ( occasionally up to five ) slender cusps , with the central one the longest . 
 Both dorsal fins are immediately preceded by stout , grooved spines , with the second much longer than the first . The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin , with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins . The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double the area of the first , with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases . The pectoral fins are small and rounded . The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin , with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins . The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising less than a quarter of the total length ; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared @-@ off tip , while the lower lobe is indistinct . The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles ; each one is recurved and thorn @-@ like , rising from an irregular star @-@ shaped base . This species is a plain dark brown above , darkening to almost black below , with white dorsal fin spines . Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal , pectoral , and pelvic fins . Minute , luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The black dogfish forms shoals or schools that tend to be larger during the winter and spring . Though fairly active , its swimming muscles exhibit lower activity of glycolytic enzymes and higher activity of creatine <unk> compared to the shallow @-@ water spiny dogfish ( Squalus acanthias ) , suggesting a lesser capacity for bursts of speed . The lipid @-@ filled liver comprises about one @-@ fifth of its total weight and functions in maintaining neutral buoyancy . Potential predators of the black dogfish are larger sharks and bony fishes . It is one of several deep @-@ sea sharks parasitized by the barnacle <unk> <unk> , which attaches in front of the second dorsal fin and impairs the reproductive development of its host . Other known parasites of this species include the fluke Otodistomum <unk> , the copepods <unk> fabricii and <unk> <unk> , and the protozoans <unk> <unk> and Trypanosoma <unk> . 
 Apparently opportunistic in feeding habits , the black dogfish typically hunts in open water , but also scavenges off the bottom . The bulk of its diet consists of a variety of bony fishes , including rattails , whitings , rockfishes , lanternfishes , and barracudinas , as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp , and cephalopods . Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages , while crustaceans become less important . Infrequently , polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten . In the northwestern Atlantic , Greenland halibut ( <unk> <unk> ) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species , particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Reproduction in the black dogfish occurs year @-@ round , with no well @-@ defined seasonal pattern . This species is aplacental viviparous , in which the developing embryos are retained inside the uterus and are sustained to term solely by yolk . Mature females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteruses . <unk> eggs are ovulated into the uterus at a diameter of 3 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 8 in ) , though a few may be retained in the ovary ; the eggs are not enclosed in a capsule . The external yolk sac is fully resorbed when the embryo is close to term , with the remaining yolk having been transferred to an internal yolk sac attached to the intestine . The internal yolk sac serves to provision the newborn shark until it learns to feed . The litter size ranges from four to 40 . Newborns measure 13 – 19 cm ( 5 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 5 in ) long . 
 Various authors have reported the size at maturity as between 46 and 63 cm ( 18 and 25 in ) for males and 51 and 70 cm ( 20 and 28 in ) for females , reflecting differences between geographical areas . Off northern Canada , females give birth in the portion of the Laurentian Channel less than 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) deep . As the young grow , they migrate into the deeper parts of the Channel , and eventually a long distance northward over the Grand Banks or the Labrador Shelf , to the deep continental slope . This movement pattern has not been observed in black dogfish inhabiting adjacent waters off western Greenland . A number of anomalous hermaphroditic specimens have been documented . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The black dogfish is harmless to humans and of little commercial value . Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep @-@ sea trawl , gillnet , and longline fisheries operating throughout the North Atlantic , including the Icelandic Greenland halibut fishery , the French mixed @-@ species trawl fishery , and the Canadian Greenland halibut , crab , redfish , monkfish , and witch fisheries . Captured sharks are usually discarded , though in recent years this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal . Reported catches by European countries , of which France made the largest contribution , have followed a declining trend from 486 tons in 2001 to 35 tons in 2006 . The average catch by Canadian fisheries was 68 tons per year from 1996 to 2005 . The black dogfish occurs mostly too deep for fisheries off southern Africa ; in the remainder of its range , little information is available on fishery impact . 
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the black dogfish under Least Concern worldwide ; it is minimally affected by fishing activity across many parts of its range , while its population in the northwestern Atlantic presently seems to be stable and may have increased from 1978 to 1995 . By contrast , the intensity of deepwater fisheries in the northeastern Atlantic has led the IUCN to give this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened . The reproductive characteristics of the black dogfish , such as a large female maturation size , may render it susceptible to overfishing , though it is more fecund than other deep @-@ sea dogfish sharks . In the northeastern Atlantic , catches of this species are managed as part of the total allowable catch for deep @-@ sea sharks set by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ( <unk> ) . 
 = Box lacrosse = 
 Box lacrosse , also known as indoor lacrosse and sometimes shortened to <unk> or simply box , is an indoor version of lacrosse played mostly in North America . The game originated in Canada , where it is the most popular version of the game played in contrast to the traditional field lacrosse game . It is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each , and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered . The playing area is called a box , in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse . The object of the game is to use a long handled racket , known as a lacrosse stick , to catch , carry , and pass the ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling a solid rubber lacrosse ball into an opponent 's goal . 
 At the highest level , box lacrosse is represented by the Senior A divisions of the Canadian Lacrosse Association ( Western Lacrosse Association of the British Columbia Lacrosse Association and Major Series Lacrosse of the Ontario Lacrosse Association ) , and the National Lacrosse League ( NLL ) . 
 While there are thirty @-@ one total members of the Federation of International Lacrosse ( FIL ) , only fifteen have competed in international box lacrosse competition . Only Canada , Iroquois Nationals and the United States have finished in the top three places at the ILF World Indoor Lacrosse Championships . 
 = = History = = 
 Lacrosse is a traditional Indigenous people 's game which was first encountered by Europeans when French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley witnessed the game in the 1630s . Lacrosse for centuries was seen as a key element of cultural identity and spiritual healing to Native Americans . It originated as a field game and was adopted first by Canadian , American , and English athletes as a field game , eventually settling on a 10 v 10 format . 
 Box lacrosse is a modern version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s . The roots of indoor lacrosse are obscure , but its invention has been attributed to one Paddy Brennan , a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal , who , being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls going out of bounds in the field game , experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s . 
 Joseph Cattarinich and Leo Dandurand , owners of the National Hockey League 's Montreal Canadiens in the 1920s , led the participating ice hockey arena owners to introduce the new sport . In the 1930s , 6 v 6 indoor lacrosse came to be played in the summer in unused hockey rinks . Canadians adopted the new version of the sport quickly . Eventually it became the more popular version of the sport in Canada , supplanting field lacrosse . This form was also adopted as the primary version of the game played on Native American reservations in the US and Canada by Iroquois and other Native peoples . , It is the only sport in which the American indigenous people are sanctioned to compete internationally , participating as the Iroquois Nationals . However , many field lacrosse enthusiasts viewed the new version of the sport with negativity . 
 The first professional box lacrosse games were held in 1931 . That summer the arena owners formed the International Lacrosse League featuring four teams : the Montreal Canadiens , Montreal Maroons , Toronto Maple Leafs , and Cornwall Colts . The league only lasted two seasons . In the wake of the original International Lacrosse League opened the American Box Lacrosse League featuring six teams : two in New York City , and one each in Brooklyn , Toronto , Boston , and Baltimore . The league played to small crowds on outdoor fields such as Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park , before closing midway through its inaugural season . Lacrosse was officially declared Canada 's National Summer Sport with the passage of the National Sports Act ( Bill C @-@ 212 ) on May 12 , 1994 . 
 The first box lacrosse match conducted in Australia came about as part of a fund raising appeal for the Queen Victoria Hospital in Melbourne . The Victorian Lacrosse Association was approached by the appeal committee to stage a lacrosse match as part of a multi sport carnival at the Plaza ( Wattle Path Palais ) ballroom at St Kilda on 1 July 1931 . After a lightning six @-@ a @-@ side ( outdoor ) tournament format was successfully carried out a few weeks prior , it was decided to play six @-@ a @-@ side for this exhibition game between MCC and a composite team from other clubs , with players wearing rubber shoes and using a softer ball for the match . Newspaper articles at the time suggest that the sport may have even been created in Australia , with P J Lally of the famous Canadian lacrosse stick manufacturing company requesting a copy of the rules of the game from the VLA Secretary . By 1933 , box lacrosse matches were being played in Adelaide , Brisbane , and Perth . This new version of the game however did not overtake the traditional version of lacrosse in popularity in Australia as happened in Canada . 
 The Canadian Lacrosse Association began sponsoring box lacrosse . In 1932 , the Mann Cup , the most prestigious lacrosse trophy in Canada , was contended for under box lacrosse rules for the first time . Previously , the national senior men 's lacrosse championship , awarded since 1901 , was competed for under field lacrosse rules . The Mann Cup is an annual tournament that presents the champion of the Western Lacrosse Association and Major Series Lacrosse in a best of seven national championship . A few years later , in 1937 , the Minto Cup , began being awarded under box lacrosse rules to the junior men 's champions . Currently the Canadian Lacrosse Association oversees the Mann Cup , the Minto Cup , the Presidents Cup ( Senior B national championship ) the Founders Cup ( Junior B national championship ) all under box lacrosse rules . 
 Briefly in 1939 , a professional box lacrosse league started up in California , called the Pacific Coast Lacrosse Association . This four team league also folded shortly after opening . Professional box lacrosse did not return to the United States again until 1968 when the Coquitlam Adanacs franchise played one Western Lacrosse Association season in Portland , Oregon . 
 A new professional indoor lacrosse league was created in the 1970s with the formation of the original National Lacrosse League . This league opened in 1974 with teams in Montreal , Toronto , Rochester , Syracuse , Philadelphia , and Maryland . For the 1975 season , Rochester moved to Boston , Syracuse moved to Quebec City , and Toronto moved to Long Island . Thus , by its second year , the original NLL was playing in all major league arenas : the Colisée de Québec , the Montreal Forum , the Boston Garden , Nassau Coliseum , the Spectrum , and the Capital Centre . When the two wealthier ' 75 NLL franchises , Philadelphia and Maryland , finished out of the playoffs , and with Montreal losing access to the fabled Montreal Forum in the upcoming season due to the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games , the league folded after two seasons due to financial uncertainty . 
 The rebirth of professional box lacrosse in the United States came on March 13 , 1986 , with the formation of the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League , which was incorporated by Russ Cline and Chris Fritz . The league originated with four teams : the Philadelphia Wings , New Jersey Saints , Washington Wave , and Baltimore Thunder , and unlike box lacrosse generally , was played during the winter . The league rebranded itself as the Major Indoor Lacrosse League ( <unk> ) immediately after its second season , and in 1998 renamed itself again , this time to the NLL . In 1998 , the NLL entered into the Canadian market for the first time with the Ontario Raiders . Although 5 of the league 's 9 teams are based in American cities , more than two @-@ thirds of the players are Canadian . 
 = = Rules = = 
 = = = Players , equipment and officials = = = 
 During play , a team consists of six players : a goalkeeper and five " runners " . A runner is any non @-@ goalkeeper position player , including forwards , transition players , and defenders . When the sport originated teams played with six runners . However , in 1953 the sixth runner , a position called rover , was eliminated . Team rosters are typically a total of as many players as a team can carry . The goalkeeper can be replaced by another runner ( often when a penalty has been signaled by the referee or at the end of a quarter ) . 
 A player 's lacrosse stick must be between 40 inches ( 1 @.@ 0 m ) and 46 inches ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) in length ( youth levels may use shorter sticks ) . In most box lacrosse leagues , the use of a traditional wooden stick is allowed . However , almost no lacrosse players use wooden sticks anymore , preferring aluminum or another metal , and a plastic head . In the NLL , wooden lacrosse sticks are not allowed . Besides a lacrosse stick , each player must also wear a certain amount of protective equipment , including a lacrosse helmet with facemask , lacrosse gloves , arm and shoulder pads , and back / kidney pads ( rib pads , optional in some leagues ) . 
 In some box leagues , especially the NLL , the five " runners " wear helmets specifically designed for box lacrosse . These helmets consist of a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse face mask attached instead of a hockey cage . Players who use these helmets often cite that they are lighter than field lacrosse helmets as the primary advantage . 
 During a typical game the number of officials can range from one to three , depending on the league and level of play . In most games there are at least two referees : a lead official and a trail official . In NLL games there are three officials per game . 
 = = = = Goaltender = = = = 
 The goaltender 's responsibility is to prevent the opposition from scoring goals by directly defending the net . Box lacrosse goaltenders equipment includes upper body gear ( measuring no more than 3 inches ( 7 @.@ 6 cm ) up and 5 inches ( 13 cm ) out off the shoulder — much larger than similar gear for field lacrosse or ice hockey goaltenders ) , large shin guards that must measure no more than 11 inches ( 28 cm ) at the knee , 9 inches ( 23 cm ) at the top of the shin and 7 inches ( 18 cm ) at the ankle , and a field lacrosse helmet or ice hockey goalie mask according to the rules set by the CLA for the 2012 season . 
 The 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) to 9 feet 3 inches ( 2 @.@ 82 m ) diameter area surrounding the net is called the " crease " . Players except for the goaltender may not enter the crease while playing the ball . Punishments for crease infractions include a change of possession , resetting of the time @-@ clock , or a possible two @-@ minute penalty depending on the infraction . Opposing players may not make contact with the goaltender while he is in the crease . Once he leaves the crease , however , he loses all goaltender privileges . 
 Even as box lacrosse grows in the United States , the American goalkeeper is a rarity . The skills required to be a successful field lacrosse goaltender and a successful box lacrosse goaltender are very different and do not lend well to one another . 
 = = = = Defenders = = = = 
 A defender is a player position whose primary responsibility is to prevent the opposing team from scoring . Unlike in field lacrosse where some defensive players carry " long poles " ( a lacrosse stick with a 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) shaft or handle ) , all box lacrosse defenders play with a maximum 46 inches ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) long stick . Defensive tactics include cross checking ( where a player uses the shaft of his stick to push the opposition player off balance ) , body checking ( where a player makes contact with the opposition player in order to slow him down ) , and stick checking ( where a player makes contact with the opposition player 's stick in order to knock the ball loose ) . 
 = = = = Transition = = = = 
 A transition player is a player whose responsibility is primarily to play during defensive situations with an offensive mindset . The goal of this player is to create <unk> and scoring opportunities . 
 = = = = Forwards = = = = 
 A forward is a player position on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive . Typically , a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other , and will primarily play on that side of the floor . Some players , known as <unk> , do not focus on one side or the other . These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender . 
 = = = Playing area = = = 
 The playing area of box lacrosse is typically an ice hockey rink during the summer months . The playing surface is usually the concrete floor underneath the melted ice . Generally the playing area is 180 feet ( 55 m ) to 200 feet ( 61 m ) in length and 80 feet ( 24 m ) to 90 feet ( 27 m ) in width . The NLL plays on artificial turf placed on top of the ice . Some leagues , and teams that have dedicated box lacrosse arenas ( such as the Iroquois ) , have outfitted their playing surface with artificial turf similar to the NLL . 
 Box lacrosse goal dimensions are traditionally 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) wide by 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) tall . In the NLL , the dimensions are slightly larger at 4 feet 9 inches ( 1 @.@ 45 m ) wide by 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) tall . These nets are significantly smaller than field lacrosse nets which measure 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) wide by 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) tall . 
 = = = Duration and tie @-@ breaking methods = = = 
 A traditional game played under the rules of the Canadian Lacrosse Association consists of three periods of 20 minutes each ( similar to ice hockey ) , with the teams changing ends each period . The NLL plays four 15 @-@ minute quarters rather than three periods . If the game is tied at the end of regulation play , a 5 @-@ minute overtime ( 15 in NLL ) can be played . Overtime may or may not be sudden victory , depending on the league . 
 = = = Ball in and out of play = = = 
 Each period , and after each goal scored , play is restarted with a face @-@ off . If a ball travels over the boards and outside of the playing area , play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball . 
 During play , teams may substitute players in and out freely . Sometimes this is referred to as " on the fly " substitution . Substitution must occur within the designated exchange area in front of the players bench in order to be legal . The sport utilizes a shot clock and the attacking team must take a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball . In additional , players must advance the ball from their own defensive end to the offensive half of the floor within 10 seconds ( 8 in NLL ) . 
 = = = Penalties = = = 
 For most penalties , the offending player is sent to the penalty box and his team has to play without him and with one less player for a short amount of time . Most penalties last for two minutes unless a major penalty has been assessed . The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing shorthanded while the other team is on the power play . 
 A two @-@ minute minor penalty is often called for lesser infractions such as slashing , tripping , elbowing , roughing , too many players , illegal equipment , holding , or interference . Five @-@ minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent , as well as for fighting . Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires , or the opposition scores a goal ( or three goals for the instance of a major penalty ) . 
 At the officials ' discretion a ten @-@ minute misconduct penalty may be assessed . These are served in full by the penalized player , but his team may immediately substitute another player on the playing area unless a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct ( a " two @-@ and @-@ ten " or " five @-@ and @-@ ten " ) . In that case , the team designates another player to serve the minor or major ; both players go to the penalty box , but only the designee may not be replaced , and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes . In addition , game misconducts are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent . A player who receives a game misconduct is ejected and may not return to play . Receiving two major penalties in a game will result in a game misconduct . 
 A penalty shot , where a player from the non @-@ offending team is given an attempt to score a goal without opposition from any defending players except the goaltender , may be awarded under certain circumstances . By rule , teams must have at least three runners in play . If a team commits a third penalty resulting in a " three man down " situation a penalty shot is awarded in favor of having the offending player serve in the penalty box . A penalty shot may also be awarded , at the referee 's discretion , if a defensive player causes a foul to prevent a goal ( by throwing his stick , holding , tripping , or by deliberately displacing the goal , or a defensive player intentionally falls and covers a ball in his own team 's crease ) . In the NLL , a penalty shot is awarded against any team taking a too @-@ many @-@ men penalty in the final two minutes of the game or overtime .

 Similar to fighting in ice hockey , fighting is tolerated in professional box lacrosse . Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection , but incur a five @-@ minute major penalty . In CLA ( Canadian Lacrosse Association ) play , players are assessed a five @-@ minute major penalty plus a game misconduct . Fighting in youth or club level box lacrosse is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions . In 1990 , when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league , fighting was specifically targeted as unacceptable . Violators were ejected from the game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three game suspension . 
 = = International competition = = 
 Box lacrosse is the most popular version of the sport in the Czech Republic . It is also played to a marginal degree in Australia , primarily by players who have played field lacrosse . Club level box lacrosse leagues in the United States have increased the number of players exposed to the sport , including the : Baltimore Indoor Lacrosse League , the Philadelphia Box Lacrosse Association , and the Metro Area Box Lacrosse League . 
 The first ever world championship of box lacrosse , " The Nations in 1980 " , was staged in several arenas in British Columbia , Canada in July 1980 involving teams representing the United States , Australia , Canada East , Canada West and the Iroquois Nationals . Canada West ( Coquitlam Adanacs ) defeated the Iroquois in the nationally televised world championship game from Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver . This was the first time in history that Indigenous peoples of the Americas people represented themselves in an athletic world championship competition . In a spirited contest at the other end of the bracket , the USA defeated Australia for bragging rights . 
 The second international box lacrosse tournament was held in 2003 , with the inaugural World Indoor Lacrosse Championships . The competitors were national teams from Australia , Canada , the Czech Republic , the Iroquois Nation , Scotland , and the United States . 
 The 2007 Championships had eight nations participating , the previous competitors plus England and Ireland . 
 The 2015 <unk> was hosted by the Onondaga Nation which marks the first time an international sporting event has been held on indigenous land . 13 teams competed in the championship : Australia , Canada , Czech Republic , England , Finland , Germany , Haudenosaunee , Ireland , Israel , Serbia , Switzerland , Turkey , United States . 
 Canada , Iroquois Nationals and the United States have won gold , silver , and bronze respectively in each of the World Indoor Lacrosse Championships held . Canada has yet to lose a international game in Box Lacrosse . 
 Other international tournaments have been played . Annually , the European Lacrosse Federation holds the Aleš <unk> Memorial tournament in Prague . This is the largest European box lacrosse tournament . In 2002 and 2004 , the Heritage Cup was played between the United States and Canada featuring mostly players that were members of NLL teams .

 Historically , box lacrosse has been exclusively a men 's sport . Women who played the sport of lacrosse typically played the more genteel women 's field lacrosse version . Recently , Ontario , Alberta , Minneapolis , Nova Scotia and British Columbia have established girls ' and women 's box lacrosse leagues . 
 During the 2003 NLL season , goaltender Ginny <unk> appeared in two preseason and one regular season game to become the only woman to make an appearance in the NLL . 
 = Hermann Göring = 
 Hermann Wilhelm Göring ( or Goering ; German : [ <unk> ] ; 12 January 1893 – 15 October 1946 ) was a German politician , military leader , and leading member of the Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) . A veteran World War I fighter pilot ace , he was a recipient of the coveted Pour le Mérite , also known as the " Blue Max " . He was the last commander of Jagdgeschwader 1 , the fighter wing once led by Manfred von Richthofen . 
 A member of the NSDAP from its earliest days , Göring was wounded in 1923 during the failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch . He became addicted to morphine after being treated with the drug for his injuries . After helping Adolf Hitler take power in 1933 , he became the second @-@ most powerful man in Germany . He founded the Gestapo in 1933 , and later gave command of it to Heinrich Himmler . Göring was appointed commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Luftwaffe ( air force ) in 1935 , a position he held until the final days of World War II . By 1940 , he was at the peak of his power and influence ; as minister in charge of the Four Year Plan , he was responsible for much of the functioning of the German economy in the build @-@ up to World War II . Hitler promoted him to the rank of Reichsmarschall , a rank senior to all other Wehrmacht commanders , and in 1941 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices . 
 Göring 's standing with Hitler was reduced by the beginning of 1943 , when the Luftwaffe failed to stop the Allied bombing of German cities and was unable to resupply German forces trapped in the Battle of Stalingrad . Göring largely withdrew from the military and political scene and focused on the acquisition of property and artwork , much of which was taken from Jewish victims of the Holocaust . Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide , Göring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to assume control of the Reich . Considering it an act of treason , Hitler removed Göring from all his positions , expelled him from the party , and ordered his arrest . 
 After World War II , Göring was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials . He was sentenced to death by hanging , but committed suicide by ingesting cyanide the night before the sentence was to be carried out . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Göring was born on 12 January 1893 at the Marienbad Sanatorium in Rosenheim , Bavaria . His father , Heinrich Ernst Göring ( 31 October 1839 – 7 December 1913 ) , a former cavalry officer , had been the first Governor @-@ General of the German protectorate of South @-@ West Africa , ( modern @-@ day Namibia ) . Heinrich had five children from a previous marriage . Göring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich 's second wife , Franziska <unk> ( 1859 – 15 July 1943 ) , a Bavarian peasant . Göring 's elder siblings were Karl , Olga , and Paula ; his younger brother was Albert . At the time that Göring was born , his father was serving as consul general in Haiti , and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth . She left the six @-@ week @-@ old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years , when she and Heinrich returned to Germany . 
 Göring 's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein , a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa . Epenstein provided the Göring family , who were surviving on Heinrich 's pension , first with a family home in Berlin @-@ <unk> , then in a small castle called Veldenstein , near Nuremberg . Göring 's mother became Epenstein 's mistress around this time , and remained so for some fifteen years . Epenstein acquired the minor title of Ritter von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown . 
 Interested in a career as a soldier from a very early age , Göring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a Boer uniform his father had given him . He was sent to boarding school at age eleven , where the food was poor and discipline was harsh . He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home , and then took to his bed , feigning illness , until he was told he would not have to return . He continued to enjoy war games , pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying Teutonic legends and sagas . He became a mountain climber , scaling peaks in Germany , at the Mont Blanc massif , and in the Austrian Alps . At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at Berlin Lichterfelde , from which he graduated with distinction ( During the Nuremberg war @-@ crimes trials In 1946 , psychologist Gustave Gilbert measured him as having an intelligence quotient ( IQ ) of 138 . ) Göring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment ( 112th Infantry ) of the Prussian army in 1912 . The next year his mother had a falling @-@ out with Epenstein . The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to Munich ; Göring 's father died shortly afterwards . When World War I began in August 1914 , Göring was stationed at Mulhouse with his regiment . 
 = = World War I = = 
 During the first year of World War I , Göring served with his infantry regiment in the area of Mülhausen , a garrison town less than 2 km from the French frontier . He was hospitalized with rheumatism , a result of the damp of trench warfare . While he was recovering , his friend Bruno Loerzer convinced him to transfer to what would become , by October 1916 , the Luftstreitkräfte ( " air combat force " ) of the German army , but his request was turned down . Later that year , Göring flew as Loerzer 's observer in <unk> Abteilung 25 ( FFA 25 ) – Göring had informally transferred himself . He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks ' confinement to barracks , but the sentence was never carried out . By the time it was supposed to be imposed , Göring 's association with Loerzer had been made official . They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the Crown Prince 's Fifth Army . They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions , for which the Crown Prince invested both Göring and Loerzer with the Iron Cross , first class . 
 After completing the pilot 's training course , Göring was assigned to Jagdstaffel 5 . Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat , he took nearly a year to recover . He then was transferred to Jagdstaffel 26 , commanded by Loerzer , in February 1917 . He steadily scored air victories until May , when he was assigned to command Jagdstaffel 27 . Serving with <unk> 5 , 26 , and 27 , he continued to win victories . In addition to his Iron Crosses ( 1st and 2nd Class ) , he received the <unk> Lion with swords , the Friedrich Order , the House Order of Hohenzollern with swords third class , and finally , in May 1918 , the coveted Pour le Mérite . According to Hermann Dahlmann , who knew both men , Göring had Loerzer lobby for the award . He finished the war with 22 victories . A thorough post @-@ war examination of Allied loss records showed that only two of his claimed victories were doubtful . Three were possible and 17 were certain , or highly likely . 
 On 7 July 1918 , following the death of Wilhelm Reinhard , successor to Manfred von Richthofen , Göring was made commander of the famed " Flying Circus " , Jagdgeschwader 1 . His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron . 
 In the last days of the war , Göring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron , first to <unk> airdrome , then to Darmstadt . At one point , he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies ; he refused . Many of his pilots intentionally crash @-@ landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands . 
 Like many other German veterans , Göring was a proponent of the Stab @-@ in @-@ the @-@ back legend , the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war , but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership : Marxists , Jews , and especially the Republicans , who had overthrown the German monarchy . 
 = = After World War I = = 
 Göring remained in aviation after the war . He tried barnstorming and briefly worked at Fokker . After spending most of 1919 living in Denmark , he moved to Sweden and joined Svensk <unk> , a Swedish airline . Göring was often hired for private flights . During the winter of 1920 – 1921 , he was hired by Count Eric von Rosen to fly him to his castle from Stockholm . Invited to spend the night , Göring may at this time have first seen the swastika emblem , which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge . 
 This was also the first time that Göring saw his future wife ; the count introduced his sister @-@ in @-@ law , Baroness Carin von <unk> ( née <unk> von Fock ) . Estranged from her husband of ten years , she had an eight @-@ year @-@ old son . Göring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm . They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921 , when Göring left for Munich to take political science at the university . Carin obtained a divorce , followed Göring to Munich , and married him on 3 February 1922 . Their first home together was a hunting lodge at <unk> in the Bavarian Alps , near <unk> , some 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) from Munich . After Göring met Adolf Hitler and joined the Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) in 1922 , they moved to <unk> , a suburb of Munich . 
 = = Early Nazi career = = 
 Göring joined the Nazi Party in 1923 after hearing a speech by Hitler . He was given command of the Sturmabteilung ( SA ) as the <unk> SA @-@ Führer in 1923 . He was later appointed an SA @-@ Gruppenführer ( Lieutenant General ) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945 . At this time , Carin — who liked Hitler — often played hostess to meetings of leading Nazis , including her husband , Hitler , Rudolf Hess , Alfred Rosenberg , and Ernst Röhm . Hitler later recalled his early association with Göring : 
 I liked him . I made him the head of my SA . He is the only one of its heads that ran the SA properly . I gave him a dishevelled rabble . In a very short time he had organised a division of 11 @,@ 000 men . 
 Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass meetings and rallies in Munich and elsewhere during the early 1920s , attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power . Inspired by Benito Mussolini 's March on Rome , the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8 – 9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch . Göring , who was with Hitler heading up the march to the War Ministry , was shot in the leg . Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed ; many top Nazis , including Hitler , were arrested . With Carin 's help , Göring was smuggled to Innsbruck , where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain . He remained in hospital until 24 December . This was the beginning of his morphine addiction , which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg . Meanwhile , the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man . The <unk> — acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad — moved from Austria to Venice . In May 1924 they visited Rome , via Florence and Siena . Göring met Mussolini , who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler , who was by then in prison . 
 Personal problems continued to multiply . By 1925 , Carin 's mother was ill . The <unk> — with difficulty — raised the money in the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria , Czechoslovakia , Poland , and Danzig ( now Gdańsk ) . Göring had become a violent morphine addict ; Carin 's family were shocked by his deterioration . Carin , who was ill with epilepsy and a weak heart , had to allow the doctors to take charge of Göring ; her son was taken by his father . Göring was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in <unk> asylum on 1 September 1925 . He was violent to the point where he had to be confined to a straitjacket , but his psychiatrist felt he was sane ; the condition was caused solely by the morphine . <unk> off the drug , he left the facility briefly , but had to return for further treatment . He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry . Hitler , who had written Mein Kampf while in prison , had been released in December 1924 . Carin Göring , ill with epilepsy and tuberculosis , died of heart failure on 17 October 1931 . 
 Meanwhile , the NSDAP was in a period of rebuilding and waiting . The economy had recovered , which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to agitate for change . The SA was reorganised , but with Franz Pfeffer von Salomon as its head rather than Göring , and the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) was founded in 1925 , initially as a bodyguard for Hitler . Membership in the party increased from 27 @,@ 000 in 1925 to 108 @,@ 000 in 1928 and 178 @,@ 000 in 1929 . In the May 1928 elections the party only obtained twelve seats out of an available 491 . Göring was elected as a representative from Bavaria . The Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy , and in the next election , the NSDAP won 6 @,@ 409 @,@ 600 votes and 107 seats in the Reichstag . In May 1931 , Hitler sent Göring on a mission to the Vatican , where he met the future Pope Pius XII . 
 In the July 1932 election , the Nazis won 230 seats to become far and away the largest party in the Reichstag . Per longstanding tradition , the Nazis were thus entitled to select the President of the Reichstag , and were able to elect Göring for the post . 
 = = Reichstag fire = = 
 The Reichstag fire occurred on the night of 27 February 1933 . Göring was one of the first to arrive on the scene . Marinus van der Lubbe — a communist radical — was arrested and claimed sole responsibility for the fire . Göring immediately called for a crackdown on communists . 
 The Nazis took advantage of the fire to advance their own political aims . The Reichstag Fire Decree , passed the next day on Hitler 's urging , suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial . Activities of the German Communist Party were suppressed , and some 4 @,@ 000 communist party members were arrested . Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot , but Rudolf Diels , head of the Prussian political police , ignored the order . Some researchers , including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock , are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire . 
 At the Nuremberg trials , General Franz Halder testified that Göring admitted responsibility for starting the fire . He said that , at a luncheon held on Hitler 's birthday in 1942 , Göring said , " The only one who really knows about the Reichstag is I , because I set it on fire ! " In his own Nuremberg testimony , Göring denied this story . 
 = = Second marriage = = 
 During the early 1930s , Göring was often in the company of Emmy <unk> , an actress from Hamburg . They were married on 10 April 1935 in Berlin ; the wedding was celebrated on a huge scale . A large reception was held the night before at the Berlin Opera House . Fighter aircraft flew overhead on the night of the reception and the day of the ceremony . Göring 's daughter , Edda , was born on 2 June 1938 . 
 = = Nazi potentate = = 
 When Hitler was named chancellor of Germany in January 1933 , Göring was appointed as minister without portfolio , Minister of the Interior for Prussia , and Reich Commissioner of Aviation . Wilhelm Frick was named Reich Interior Minister . Frick and head of the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) Heinrich Himmler hoped to create a unified police force for all of Germany , but Göring on 30 November 1933 established a Prussian police force , with Rudolf Diels at its head . The force was called the Geheime Staatspolizei , or Gestapo . Göring , thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA , handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934 . By this time , the SA numbered over two million men . 
 Hitler was deeply concerned that Ernst Röhm , the chief of the SA , was planning a coup . Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA . Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934 . Enraged , Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership . Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide ; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees — numbering in the thousands — and determined who else should be shot . At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July , which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives . Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal , but claimed a plot had been underway to overthrow the Reich . A retroactive law was passed making the action legal . Any criticism was met with arrests . 
 One of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , which had been in place since the end of World War I , stated that Germany was not allowed to maintain an air force . After the 1926 signing of the Kellogg – Briand Pact , police aircraft were permitted . Göring was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933 . Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty , and in 1935 the existence of the Luftwaffe was formally acknowledged , with Göring as Reich Aviation Minister . 
 During a cabinet meeting in September 1936 , Göring and Hitler announced that the German rearmament programme must be sped up . On 18 October , Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan to undertake this task . Göring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella . He bypassed the economics ministry in his policy @-@ making decisions , to the chagrin of Hjalmar Schacht , the minister in charge . Huge expenditures were made on rearmament , in spite of growing deficits . Schacht resigned on 8 December 1937 , and Walther Funk took over the position , as well as control of the Reichsbank . In this way , both of these institutions were brought under Göring 's control under the auspices of the Four Year Plan . In July 1937 , the <unk> Hermann Göring was established under state ownership – though led by Göring – with the aim of boosting steel production beyond the level which private enterprise could economically provide . 
 In 1938 , Göring was involved in the Blomberg – Fritsch Affair , which led to the resignations of the War Minister , Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg , and the army commander , General Werner von Fritsch . Göring had acted as witness at Blomberg 's wedding to Margarethe <unk> , a 26 @-@ year @-@ old typist , on 12 January 1938 . Information received from the police showed that the young bride was a prostitute . Göring felt obligated to tell Hitler , but also saw this event as an opportunity to dispose of the field marshal . Blomberg was forced to resign . Göring did not want Fritsch to be appointed to that position and thus be his superior . Several days later , Heydrich revealed a file on Fritsch that contained allegations of homosexual activity and blackmail . The charges were later proven to be false , but Fritsch had lost Hitler 's trust and was forced to resign . Hitler used the dismissals as an opportunity to reshuffle the leadership of the military . Göring asked for the post of War Minister , but was turned down ; he was appointed to the rank of field marshal . Hitler took over as supreme commander of the armed forces and created subordinate posts to head the three main branches of service . 
 As minister in charge of the Four Year Plan , Göring became concerned with the lack of natural resources in Germany , and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich . The province of Styria had rich iron ore deposits , and the country as a whole was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful . Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria , his native country . He met on 12 February 1938 with Austrian chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg , threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming . The Nazi party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base , and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March . When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite , Göring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state Wilhelm <unk> to demand Schuschnigg 's resignation , threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members . Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the plebiscite was cancelled . By 5 : 30 the next morning , German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria , meeting no resistance . 
 Although Joachim von Ribbentrop had been named Foreign Minister in February 1938 , Göring continued to involve himself in foreign affairs . That July , he contacted the British government with the idea that he should make an official visit to discuss Germany 's intentions for Czechoslovakia . Neville Chamberlain was in favour of a meeting , and there was talk of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany . In February 1938 , Göring visited Warsaw to quell rumours about the upcoming invasion of Poland . He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well , discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia . At the Nuremberg Rally that September , Göring and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered . Chamberlain met with Hitler in a series of meetings that led to the signing of the Munich Agreement ( 29 September 1938 ) , which turned over control of the Sudetenland to Germany .

 Göring and other senior officers were concerned that Germany was not yet ready for war , but Hitler insisted on pushing ahead as soon as possible . The invasion of Poland , the opening action of World War II , began at dawn on 1 September 1939 . Later in the day , speaking to the Reichstag , Hitler designated Göring as his successor as Führer of all Germany , " If anything should befall me . " Big German victories followed one after the other in quick succession . With the help of the Luftwaffe , the Polish Air Force was defeated within a week . The Fallschirmjäger seized vital airfields in Norway and captured Fort Eben @-@ Emael in Belgium . Göring 's Luftwaffe played critical roles in the Battles of the Netherlands , Belgium and France in the spring , 1940 . 
 After the Fall of France , Hitler awarded Göring the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross for his successful leadership . During the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony , Hitler promoted Göring to the rank of Reichsmarschall des <unk> <unk> ( Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich ) , a special rank which made him senior to all field marshals in the military , including the Luftwaffe . As a result of his promotion , he was then the top ranking soldier of all Germany until the end of the war . Göring had already received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross on 30 September 1939 as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe . 
 The UK had declared war on Germany immediately after the invasion of Poland . In July 1940 , Hitler began preparations for an invasion of Britain . As part of the plan , the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) had to be neutralized . Bombing raids commenced on British air installations and on cities and centres of industry . Göring had by then already announced in a radio speech , " Wenn auch nur ein <unk> <unk> unser <unk> <unk> , will ich Meier <unk> ! " ( " If as much as a single enemy aircraft flies over German soil , my name is Meier ! " ) , something that would return to haunt him , when the RAF began bombing German cities on 11 May 1940 . Though he was confident the Luftwaffe could defeat the RAF within days , Göring , like Admiral Erich Raeder , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Kriegsmarine ( Navy ) , was pessimistic about the chance of success of the planned invasion ( codenamed Operation Sea Lion ) . Göring hoped that a victory in the air would be enough to force peace without an invasion . The campaign failed , and Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940 . After their defeat in the Battle of Britain , the Luftwaffe attempted to defeat Britain via strategic bombing . On 12 October 1940 Hitler cancelled Sea Lion due to the onset of winter . By the end of the year , it was clear that British morale was not being shaken by the Blitz , though the bombings continued through May 1941 . 
 = = = Decline on all fronts = = = 
 In spite of the Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact , signed in 1939 , Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa — the invasion of the Soviet Union — on 22 June 1941 . Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage , destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft in the first month of fighting . Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas , and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment . But , by July , the Germans had only 1 @,@ 000 planes remaining in operation , and their troop losses were over 213 @,@ 000 men . The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front ; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow . After the long , but successful , Battle of Smolensk , Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev . The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves ; historian Russel <unk> considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive , which was resumed in October 1941 with the Battle of Moscow . Poor weather conditions , fuel shortages , a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe , and overstretched supply lines were also factors . Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid @-@ January 1942 ; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the French invasion of Russia in 1812 . 
 Hitler decided that the summer 1942 campaign would be concentrated in the south ; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the Caucasus . The Battle of Stalingrad , a major turning point of the war , began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe . The Sixth Army entered the city , but because of its location on the front line , it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies . When the Sixth Army was surrounded by the end of November in Operation Uranus , Göring promised that the Luftwaffe would be able to deliver a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day . On the basis of these assurances , Hitler demanded that there be no retreat ; they were to fight to the last man . Though some airlifts were able to get through , the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day . The remnants of the German Sixth Army — some 91 @,@ 000 men out of an army of 285 @,@ 000 — surrendered in early February 1943 ; only 5 @,@ 000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again .

 Meanwhile , the strength of the American and British bomber fleets had increased . Based in Britain , they began operations against German targets . The first thousand @-@ bomber raid was staged on Cologne on 30 May 1942 . Air raids continued on targets further from Britain after auxiliary fuel tanks were installed on American fighter aircraft . Göring refused to believe reports that American fighters had been shot down as far east as Aachen in winter 1943 . His reputation began to decline . 
 The American P @-@ 51 Mustang , with a range of 1 @,@ 800 miles ( 2 @,@ 900 km ) , began to accompany the bombers in large numbers to and from the target area in early 1944 . From that point onwards , the Luftwaffe began to suffer casualties in aircrews it could not sufficiently replace . By targeting oil refineries and rail communications , Allied bombers crippled the German war effort by late 1944 . German civilians blamed Göring for his failure to protect the homeland . Hitler began excluding him from conferences , but continued him in his positions at the head of the Luftwaffe and as plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan . As he lost Hitler 's trust , Göring began to spend more time at his various residences . On D @-@ Day ( 6 June 1944 ) , the Luftwaffe only had some 300 fighters and a small number of bombers in the area of the landings ; the Allies had a total strength of 11 @,@ 000 aircraft .

 As the Soviets approached Berlin , Hitler 's efforts to organize the defence of the city became ever more meaningless and futile . His last birthday , celebrated at the Führerbunker in Berlin on 20 April 1945 , was the occasion for leave @-@ taking for many top Nazis , Göring included . By this time , Carinhall had been evacuated , the building destroyed , and its art treasures moved to Berchtesgaden and elsewhere . Göring arrived at his estate at Obersalzberg on 22 April , the same day that Hitler , in a lengthy diatribe against his generals , first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide . He also stated that Göring was in a better position to negotiate a peace settlement . In 1941 — a week after the start of the Soviet invasion — Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death . 
 OKW operations chief Alfred Jodl was present for Hitler 's rant , and notified Göring 's chief of staff , Karl Koller , at a meeting a few hours later . Sensing its implications , Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify Göring , who feared being accused of treason if he tried to take power . On the other hand , if he did nothing , he feared being accused of dereliction of duty . After some hesitation , Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler 's successor . It not only placed Göring first in the line of succession , but also stated that , if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action , Göring had complete authority to act on Hitler 's behalf as his deputy . After conferring with Koller and Hans Lammers , the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery , Göring concluded that , by remaining in Berlin to face certain death , Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing . All agreed that Göring therefore had a clear duty to take power in Hitler 's stead . He was also motivated by fears that his rival , Martin Bormann , would seize power upon Hitler 's death and would have him killed as a traitor . With this in mind , Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany , stressing that he would be acting as Hitler 's deputy . He added that , if Hitler did not reply by 22 : 00 that night ( 23 April ) , he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action , and would assume leadership of the Reich . 
 The telegram was intercepted by Bormann , who convinced Hitler that Göring was a traitor and that the telegram was a demand to resign or be overthrown . Hitler sent a reply to Göring — prepared with Bormann 's help — informing him that , unless he resigned immediately , he would be executed for high treason . Soon afterward , Hitler removed Göring from all of his offices and ordered Göring , his staff and Lammers placed under house arrest at Obersalzberg . Bormann made an announcement over the radio that Göring had resigned for health reasons . 
 By 26 April , the complex at Obersalzberg was under attack by the Allies , so Göring was moved to his castle at <unk> . In his last will and testament , Hitler expelled Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor . He then appointed Karl Dönitz , the Navy 's commander @-@ in @-@ chief , as president of the Reich and commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the armed forces . Hitler and his wife , Eva Braun , committed suicide on 30 April 1945 , a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding . Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit , and he made his way to the American lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Russians . He was taken into custody near <unk> on 6 May by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the United States Army . This move likely saved Göring 's life ; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen . 
 = = Trial and death = = 
 Göring was flown to Camp Ashcan , a temporary prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp housed in the Palace Hotel at Mondorf @-@ les @-@ Bains , Luxembourg . Here he was weaned off <unk> ( a mild morphine derivative ) — he had been taking the equivalent of three or four grains ( 260 to 320 mg ) of morphine a day — and was put on a strict diet ; he lost 60 pounds ( 27 kg ) . His IQ was tested while in custody and found to be 138 . Top Nazi officials were transferred in September to Nuremberg , which was to be the location of a series of military tribunals beginning in November . 
 Göring was the second @-@ highest @-@ ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg , behind Reich President ( former Admiral ) Karl Dönitz . The prosecution levelled an indictment of four charges , including a charge of conspiracy ; waging a war of aggression ; war crimes , including the plundering and removal to Germany of works of art and other property ; and crimes against humanity , including the disappearance of political and other opponents under the Nacht und Nebel ( Night and Fog ) decree ; the torture and ill @-@ treatment of prisoners of war ; and the murder and enslavement of civilians , including what was at the time estimated to be 5 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 Jews . Not permitted to present a lengthy statement , Göring declared himself to be " in the sense of the indictment not guilty " . The trial lasted 218 days ; the prosecution presented their case from November through March , and Göring 's defence — the first to be presented — lasted from 8 to 22 March . The sentences were read out on 30 September 1946 . Göring , forced to remain silent while seated in the dock , communicated his opinions about the proceedings using gestures , shaking his head , or laughing . He constantly took notes and whispered with the other defendants , and tried to control the erratic behaviour of Hess , who was seated beside him . During breaks in the proceedings , Göring tried to dominate the other defendants , and he was eventually placed in solitary confinement when he attempted to influence their testimony . 
 Captain Gustave Gilbert , a German @-@ speaking American intelligence officer and psychologist , interviewed Göring and the others in prison during the trial . Gilbert kept a journal , which he later published as Nuremberg Diary . Here he describes Göring on the evening of 18 April 1946 , as the trials were halted for a three @-@ day Easter recess : 
 Sweating in his cell in the evening , Göring was defensive and deflated and not very happy over the turn the trial was taking . He said that he had no control over the actions or the defense of the others , and that he had never been anti @-@ Semitic himself , had not believed these atrocities , and that several Jews had offered to testify on his behalf . 
 On several occasions over the course of the trial , the prosecution showed films of the concentration camps and other atrocities . Everyone present , including Göring , found the contents of the films shocking ; he said that the films must have been faked . Witnesses , including Paul Koerner and Erhard Milch , tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate . Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders ; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one 's family . When testifying on his own behalf , Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler , and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps , which were under Himmler 's control . He gave evasive , convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war . He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich , attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war . During cross @-@ examination , chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after Kristallnacht , a major pogrom in November 1938 . At the meeting , Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom . Later , David Maxwell @-@ Fyfe proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the Stalag Luft III murders — the shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from Stalag Luft III — in time to have prevented the killings . He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the Hungarian Jews . 
 Göring was found guilty on all four counts and was sentenced to death by hanging . The judgment stated : 
 There is nothing to be said in mitigation . For Göring was often , indeed almost always , the moving force , second only to his leader . He was the leading war aggressor , both as political and as military leader ; he was the director of the slave labour programme and the creator of the oppressive programme against the Jews and other races , at home and abroad . All of these crimes he has frankly admitted . On some specific cases there may be conflict of testimony , but in terms of the broad outline , his own admissions are more than sufficiently wide to be conclusive of his guilt . His guilt is unique in its enormity . The record discloses no excuses for this man . 
 Göring made an appeal asking to be shot as a soldier instead of hanged as a common criminal , but the court refused . Defying the sentence imposed by his captors , he committed suicide with a potassium cyanide capsule the night before he was to be hanged . 
 One theory as to how Göring obtained the poison holds that U.S. Army Lieutenant Jack G. <unk> , who was stationed at the Nuremberg Trials , retrieved the capsules from their hiding place among Göring 's personal effects that had been confiscated by the Army and handed them over to the prisoner , after being bribed by Göring , who gave him his gold watch , pen , and cigarette case . In 2005 , former U.S. Army Private Herbert Lee Stivers , who served in the 1st Infantry Division 's 26th Infantry Regiment — the honour guard for the Nuremberg Trials — claimed he gave Göring " medicine " hidden inside a fountain pen that a German woman had asked him to smuggle into the prison . Stivers later said that he did not know what was in the pill until after Göring 's suicide . 
 Göring 's body , as those of the other executed men , was displayed at the execution ground for the witnesses of the executions . The bodies were cremated at <unk> ( Munich ) and the ashes were scattered in the Isar River . 
 = = Personal properties = = 
 The confiscation of Jewish property gave Göring the opportunity to amass a personal fortune . Some properties he seized himself or acquired for a nominal price . In other cases , he collected bribes for allowing others to steal Jewish property . He took kickbacks from industrialists for favourable decisions as Four Year Plan director , and money for supplying arms to the Spanish Republicans in the Spanish Civil War via <unk> in Greece ( although Germany was supporting Franco and the Nationalists ) . 
 Göring was appointed Reich Master of the Hunt in 1933 and Master of the German Forests in 1934 . He instituted reforms to the forestry laws and acted to protect endangered species . Around this time he became interested in <unk> Forest , where he set aside 100 @,@ 000 acres ( 400 km2 ) as a state park , which is still extant . There he built an elaborate hunting lodge , Carinhall , in memory of his first wife , Carin . By 1934 , her body had been transported to the site and placed in a vault on the estate . The main lodge had a large art gallery where Göring displayed works that had been plundered from private collections and museums around Europe from 1939 onward . Göring worked closely with the <unk> Reichsleiter Rosenberg ( Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce ) , an organisation tasked with the looting of artwork and cultural material from Jewish collections , libraries , and museums throughout Europe . Headed by Alfred Rosenberg , the task force set up a collection centre and headquarters in Paris . Some 26 @,@ 000 railroad cars full of art treasures , furniture , and other looted items were sent to Germany from France alone . Göring repeatedly visited the Paris headquarters to review the incoming stolen goods and to select items to be sent on a special train to Carinhall and his other homes . The estimated value of his collection — numbering some 1 @,@ 500 pieces — was $ 200 million . 
 Göring was known for his extravagant tastes and garish clothing . He had various special uniforms made for the many posts he held ; his Reichsmarschall uniform included a jewel @-@ encrusted baton . Hans @-@ Ulrich Rudel , the top Stuka pilot of the war , recalled twice meeting Göring dressed in outlandish costumes : first , a medieval hunting costume , practicing archery with his doctor ; and second , dressed in a red toga fastened with a golden clasp , smoking an unusually large pipe . Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano once noted Göring wearing a fur coat that looked like what " a high grade prostitute wears to the opera " . He threw lavish housewarming parties each time a round of construction was completed at Carinhall , and changed costumes several times throughout the evenings . 
 Göring was noted for his patronage of music , especially opera . He entertained frequently and sumptuously , and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself . Armaments minister Albert Speer recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars , Dutch cigars , and valuable artwork . For his birthday in 1944 , Speer gave Göring an oversize marble bust of Hitler . As a member of the Prussian Council of State , Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council 's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked . Field Marshal Erhard Milch told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry 's general fund . For his birthday in 1940 , Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted Collar of Annunziata . The award reduced him to tears . 
 The design of the Reichsmarschall standard , on a light blue field , featured a gold German eagle grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons overlaid with a swastika . The reverse side of the flag had the <unk> des Eisernen Kreuzes ( " Grand Cross of the Iron Cross " ) surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles . The flag was carried by a personal standard @-@ bearer at all public occasions . 
 Though he liked to be called " der Eiserne " ( the Iron Man ) , the once dashing and muscular fighter pilot had become corpulent . He was one of the few Nazi leaders who did not take offense at hearing jokes about himself , " no matter how rude " , taking them as a sign of popularity . Germans joked about his ego , saying that he would wear an admiral 's uniform to take a bath , and his obesity , joking that " he sits down on his stomach " . One joke claimed that he had sent a wire to Hitler after his visit to the Vatican : " Mission accomplished . Pope <unk> . Tiara and pontifical vestments are a perfect fit . " 
 = = Complicity in the Holocaust = = 
 Goebbels and Himmler were far more antisemitic than Göring , who mainly adopted that attitude because party politics required him to do so . His own deputy , Erhard Milch , had a Jewish parent . But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 , and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews . He required the registration of all Jewish property as part of the Four Year Plan , and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German @-@ owned insurance companies . He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks . 
 At the same meeting , options for the disposition of the Jews and their property were discussed . Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate , and their property would be seized in a programme of Aryanization . Compensation for seized property would be low , if any was given at all . Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial , proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews . He told Gilbert that he would never have supported the anti @-@ Jewish measures if he had known what was going to happen . " I only thought we would eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government , " he claimed . 
 In July 1941 , Göring issued a memo to Reinhard Heydrich ordering him to organise the practical details of a solution to the " Jewish Question " . By the time that this letter was written , many Jews and others had already been killed in Poland , Russia , and elsewhere . At the Wannsee Conference , held six months later , Heydrich formally announced that genocide of the Jews of Europe was now official Reich policy . Göring did not attend the conference , but he was present at other meetings where the number of people killed was discussed .

 Göring 's younger brother Albert despised Nazism , and offered active resistance to the regime , including helping prisoners escape from concentration camps .

 = Episode 2 ( Twin Peaks ) = 
 " Episode 2 " , also known as " Zen , or the Skill to Catch a Killer " , is the third episode of the first season of the American mystery television series Twin Peaks . The episode was written by series creators David Lynch and Mark Frost , and directed by Lynch . It features series regulars Kyle MacLachlan , Michael Ontkean , Ray Wise and Richard Beymer ; and introduces Michael J. Anderson as The Man from Another Place , Miguel Ferrer as Albert Rosenfield and David Patrick Kelly as Jerry Horne . 
 Twin Peaks centers on the investigation into the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer ( Sheryl Lee ) , in the small rural town in Washington state after which the series is named . In this episode , Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Dale Cooper ( MacLachlan ) tells Sheriff Truman ( Ontkean ) and his deputies about a unique method of narrowing down the suspects in Palmer 's death . Meanwhile , Cooper 's cynical colleague Albert Rosenfield ( Ferrer ) arrives in town , and Cooper has a strange dream that elevates the murder investigation to a new level . 
 " Episode 2 " was first broadcast on April 19 , 1990 , on the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) network , and was watched by an audience of 19 @.@ 2 million households in the United States , equating to roughly 21 percent of the available audience . " Episode 2 " has been well @-@ received since its initial broadcast , and is regarded by critics as a ground @-@ breaking television episode . It has since influenced , and been parodied by , several subsequent television series . Academic readings of the episode have highlighted its depiction of heuristic , a priori knowledge , and the sexual undertones of several characters ' actions .

 The small fictional town of Twin Peaks , Washington , has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer ( Sheryl Lee ) and the attempted murder of her classmate Ronette Pulaski ( Phoebe Augustine ) . Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent Dale Cooper ( Kyle MacLachlan ) has come to the town to investigate , and initial suspicion has fallen upon Palmer 's boyfriend Bobby Briggs ( Dana Ashbrook ) and the man with whom she was cheating on Briggs , James Hurley ( James Marshall ) . However , other inhabitants of the town have their own suspicions : the violent , drug @-@ dealing truck driver Leo Johnson ( Eric Da Re ) is seen as a possible suspect .

 The Horne family — Ben ( Richard Beymer ) , Audrey ( Sherilyn Fenn ) , and Johnny ( Robert Bauer ) — are eating dinner when they are interrupted by Ben 's brother Jerry ( David Patrick Kelly ) . The brothers share brie and butter <unk> while Ben tells Jerry of Laura Palmer 's murder and the failing of the <unk> project . They decide to visit One Eyed Jacks , a casino and brothel across the Canadian border , where Ben wins a coin flip to determine who will be the first to sleep with the newest prostitute . 
 Bobby Briggs and Mike Nelson ( Gary Hershberger ) drive into the woods to pick up a hidden delivery of cocaine , but are ambushed by Leo Johnson , who demands the $ 10 @,@ 000 the pair owe him . Leo also hints that he suspects someone has been sleeping with his wife Shelly ( Mädchen Amick ) , then scares the pair off . When Bobby visits Shelly at her home the next day , he discovers that Leo has beaten her . 
 Dale Cooper receives a phone call from Hawk ( Michael Horse ) about a one @-@ armed man seen at Ronette Pulaski 's hospital bed . The next morning , Cooper gathers together Sheriff Truman ( Michael Ontkean ) , Deputies Hawk and Brennan ( Harry Goaz ) , and Lucy Moran ( Kimmy Robertson ) in a forest clearing to demonstrate his unusual approach to eliminating suspects from their investigation . As each suspect 's name is read from a list , Cooper throws a stone at a bottle placed 60 feet 6 inches ( 18 @.@ 44 m ) away . Each time he hits the bottle with a stone , he considers the previous name read out to be of interest to the case . The method points his suspicion at Leo Johnson and psychiatrist Lawrence Jacoby ( Russ Tamblyn ) . Dale 's fellow FBI agent Albert Rosenfield ( Miguel Ferrer ) arrives later , while Truman and Cooper review evidence , and immediately causes friction between himself and Truman . 
 James Hurley and Donna Hayward ( Lara Flynn Boyle ) discuss their new relationship , and kiss passionately on Donna 's sofa . Elsewhere , Leland Palmer ( Ray Wise ) , still mourning Laura 's death , dances in his living room , sobbing and holding a portrait of Laura as he does so . He breaks open the picture 's frame , cutting his hands , as his wife Sarah ( Grace Zabriskie ) screams at him to stop . 
 Cooper retires to bed at his hotel room , and experiences a strange dream featuring the one @-@ armed man , who identifies himself as MIKE , and BOB , who vows to " kill again " . Cooper then dreams he is in a room hung with red curtains . The Man from Another Place ( Michael J. Anderson ) and Laura Palmer speak to him in a jarring and disjointed manner , before Laura leans over to whisper in his ear . Cooper wakes up , telephones Harry , and declares that he knows who the murderer is .

 " Episode 2 " was the second episode of the series to have been directed by series creator David Lynch , who had also helmed " Pilot " , and would direct a further four episodes during Twin Peaks ' run . The episode was written by both Lynch and co @-@ creator Mark Frost ; the pair had co @-@ written the prior two episodes . Frost would pen a further eight scripts for the series after " Episode 2 " , while Lynch would write just one episode — the second season opening installment , " Episode 8 " . 
 " Episode 2 " introduces the character of The Man from Another Place , played by Michael J. Anderson . The Red Room seen in the episode 's final scene was created from scratch by Lynch for the European release of " Pilot " , and was not originally intended to be a part of the American series . Lynch was so pleased with the result that he decided to incorporate it into the regular series . The Red Room would later be revealed as a waiting room for the Black Lodge , a mystical dimension bordering the town of Twin Peaks . Lynch claims to have conceived most of the sequence while leaning against his car on a cold night while its chassis was hot , and free @-@ associating ideas . The director first met Anderson in 1987 while continuing work on Ronnie Rocket , a planned film project about " electricity and a three @-@ foot guy with red hair " which was ultimately scrapped . He thought of Anderson immediately upon conceiving the Black Lodge . 
 Miguel Ferrer , who made his first appearance as Albert Rosenfield in this episode , had met Lynch while working on another film project that was also never made . Lynch remembered Ferrer when casting Twin Peaks , and sent him the scripts for both " Episode 1 " and " Episode 2 " . Ferrer found the scripts difficult to understand until Frost gave him a recording of " Pilot " , which cleared up the actor 's confusion . 
 Dialogue heard in the dream sequence uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech . This was achieved by recording the actors ' line phonetically reversed , and playing this audio backwards . David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971 , and had originally planned to use it in his 1977 debut feature , Eraserhead , before it finally found use in this episode . Describing the process of learning his lines backwards , Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front , and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result . The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect . The actors were required to perform their movements backwards , as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely . 
 Frank Byers , the episode 's director of photography , has stated that the chief inspiration for his choice to use wide @-@ angle lenses and soft lighting throughout the episode was the 1958 Orson Welles film Touch of Evil . Byers also eschewed the use of additional lighting beyond that which he felt was necessary , and chose to work mainly with the natural light of the location or set in question , and to light the scene from the floor when additional light was needed . The location used for One Eyed Jacks appeared in only one other episode of the series after its appearance here , with footage for both filmed on the same day . When the setting was revisited in the series ' second season , a set was built to represent another part of the building instead . The female cast members were deliberately lit with soft lighting from a close range , as this helped to create a " veneer of innocence and comfort " . 
 Kimmy Robertson — who plays sheriff 's office receptionist Lucy Moran — has described Lynch 's directorial style as hypnotic , finding that his question @-@ and @-@ answer approach of discussing scenes with the cast was unique among directors she had worked with . Robertson also noted that during the filming of Cooper 's stone @-@ throwing , Lynch " sat [ the cast ] down and told Kyle he was going to hit the bottle ... Kyle hit it , and everybody freaked out . It was like David used the power of the universe " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Scenes in " Episode 2 " — especially the rock @-@ throwing scene in the forest — have been cited as introducing a spiritual side to the character of Dale Cooper , which would also be expounded in the later " Episode 16 " . Simon Riches , in an essay included in The Philosophy of David Lynch , has noted that the Red Room dream sequence is an example of the difficulty in rationalizing a priori knowledge — the " lack of empirical evidence that ... a faculty of intuition exists " in the mind is here represented by the " <unk> " , dreamlike Red Room . Cooper 's heuristic approach " pointedly avoids the routine deductive apparati of logic , clues or muscle " . The fact that the series ' protagonist embraces this intuitive manner of deduction sets Twin Peaks " at odds with the naturalistic trend in analytic philosophy " . This dreamlike approach is a hallmark of Lynch , who , according to Greg Olson in his book Beautiful Dark , " has always identified himself as an artist first , a man fascinated by spiritual realms who 's committed to expressing his inner life " . 
 The episode 's reliance on surrealism has also been seen as symptomatic of " a broader move away from social realism within television drama " . The episode makes use of strong color cues and unusual camera angles — in particular , the brown color palette and low @-@ angle shots used to represent the character of Leland Palmer have been described by Helen Wheatley , author of Gothic Television , as creating " a mood of domestic terror " , which serves to cue the audience to his eventual outing as his daughter 's killer . Palmer 's dance while holding his daughter 's picture has been seen as " a time @-@ honored metaphor for marriage " , an " incestuous <unk> " which hints towards his abusive past . Both incest and violent sexuality would become recurring themes for the series , examples of which include Palmer 's later murder and possible molestation of his niece Maddy and Benjamin Horne 's unwitting brush with incest with his masked daughter in the One @-@ Eyed Jacks brothel . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 " Episode 2 " first aired on the ABC Network on April 19 , 1990 . The initial broadcast was viewed by 12 @.@ 1 million households in the United States — which represented 21 percent of the available audience and 13 @.@ 1 percent of all households in the country . This represented a drop in viewing figures from the previous episode , " Episode 1 " , which was seen by 14 @.@ 9 million households , or 27 percent of the available audience . The broadcast inspired several complaints about the sexual overtones of the scene in which the characters of Ben and Jerry Horne eat baguette sandwiches . 
 The episode has been well @-@ received critically . Writing for The Boston Globe , Gail Caldwell compared Lynch and Frost 's script for the episode to the works of mid @-@ 20th century American writers Sherwood Anderson , Flannery O 'Connor and Truman Capote , describing it as an " excavation of the fear and madness poised behind an ordinary small @-@ town veneer " . Caldwell also praised Lynch 's direction , finding that several of the episode 's " nerve @-@ wracking " scenes lasted just the right amount of time to be effective , and noting that " the line between confronting the abyss and exploiting it is one Lynch walks again and again " . Writing for The A.V. Club , Keith Phipps rated the episode an A , calling it " one of the most peculiar hours of television ever to air on a network " . He praised the episode 's portrayal of the Black Lodge , called the dream sequence " some of the most disquieting filmmaking Lynch has ever done " , and described its depiction as " a weirdly All @-@ American [ sic ] supernatural system " that seems " completely terrifying " . Fellow A.V. Club writer Noel Murray felt that the episode pushed " into previously unexplored television territory " , and that the climactic Black Lodge dream sequence came to be seen as " the signature moment in the entirety of Twin Peaks " . Den of Geek 's <unk> <unk> has called the episode " truly groundbreaking TV material " , noting the use of " surreal imagery with its roots in psychoanalysis " . 
 Writing for AllMovie , Andrea LeVasseur rated the episode four out of five stars , called it " memorable and pivotal " , and described the Red Room dream as " unforgettable " . Jen Chaney , writing for The Washington Post , has called the episode " the best in the series " . Chaney described it , and the dream sequence specifically , as having " turned Twin Peaks into a water @-@ cooler phenomenon " , and noted that it may have inspired later series such as The Sopranos and Lost to " feel comfortable taking risks with their audience " . The Washington Post 's Tom Shales has described the dream sequence as " the scene that separated the men from the boys " , noting that it further polarized the series ' audience , attracting loyal viewers and putting off others . The sequence , and the episode as a whole , attracted negative criticism from The Boston Globe 's Ed Siegel , who felt that the series " lost its magic " by this point . Siegel added that " anyone with less than a semester 's worth of either <unk> 101 or <unk> 102 can come up with dancing dwarves , one @-@ armed men , psychic detectives , psycho killers , llamas in the waiting room and hints of incest and necrophilia " , and felt that a reliance on surrealism made Lynch seem to be a " one trick pony " . 
 The episode 's ending was parodied in " Who Shot Mr. Burns ? " , a 1995 two @-@ part episode of The Simpsons , in which Dale Cooper and The Man from Another Place were replaced by the characters of Chief Wiggum and Lisa Simpson , respectively . The backwards speech and unexplained shadow moving across a wall were included in the parody , which takes place in a detailed recreation of the Black Lodge . 
 = Hurricane Barbara ( 2013 ) = 
 Hurricane Barbara was the easternmost landfalling Pacific hurricane on record . As the first hurricane of the 2013 Pacific hurricane season , Barbara developed from a low @-@ pressure area while located southeast of Mexico on May 28 . It headed slowly north @-@ northeastward and strengthened into a tropical storm early on the following day . After recurving to the northeast , Barbara intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on May 29 and made landfall in Chiapas at peak intensity with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and a barometric pressure estimated at 983 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 03 inHg ) . When the hurricane made landfall , it was the second earliest landfalling hurricane in the basin since reliable records began in 1966 . Barbara then moved across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and dissipated within the mountainous terrain of Sierra Madre de Chiapas on May 30 . 
 The precursor of Hurricane Barbara brought light to moderate rainfall to El Salvador . Many homes were damaged , roads were flooded , and several trees were downed . One fatality was reported in the country . Landslides caused by rainfall in Guatemala forced 30 people to flee their homes . In Mexico , tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in <unk> of the storm . Many shelters opened in Chiapas , Oaxaca and Guatemala while schools and ports were temporarily closed during the storm . Torrential rains and power outages were reported in the area . In the state of Chiapas alone , 2 @,@ 000 houses were damaged . About 57 @,@ 000 people were left homeless . Significant impact to agriculture was also reported , with 10 @,@ 000 ha ( 25 @,@ 000 acres ) of crops destroyed . Overall , Barbara caused 5 fatalities and at least $ 1 million ( 2013 USD ) in damage .

That day , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather about 150 mi ( 240 km ) southwest of the Costa Rican coastline . At that time , this system was associated with a monsoon trough embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone . Despite being disorganized , gradual development of this system was anticipated by the NHC . On May 25 , a broad low pressure area formed southwest of Nicaragua , after the tropical wave interacted with an eastward @-@ moving Kelvin wave . Convection soon became organized around the newly formed low , and the NHC noted that the formation of a tropical cyclone within the subsequent 48 hours was likely . The NHC estimated that Tropical Depression Two @-@ E developed at 1200 UTC on May 28 about 125 mi ( 205 km ) south @-@ southeast of Puerto Ángel , Oaxaca . 
 With warm water temperatures of over 86 ° F ( 30 ° C ) and low wind shear , the newly formed tropical depression was able to quickly intensify . It developed a well @-@ defined center with concentrated deep convection . Continued organization prompted the NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Barbara at 0000 UTC on May 29 . Post @-@ analysis indicated that Barbara intensified into a tropical storm six hours earlier than originally assessed . Barbara began exhibiting an eye @-@ like feature , and intensity estimates using the Dvorak Technique reached 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . At this time , Barbara had begun to recurve to the northeast , within a gap of the subtropical ridge . By midnight , the eye @-@ like feature developed into a central dense overcast ( CDO ) , embedded within the deep convection . The rainbands of Barbara wrapped around much of the circulation , and radar imagery indicated the eyewall was consistently becoming better defined . Thereafter , the storm entered a phase of intensification as it began to accelerate towards the Chiapan coastline . 
 Barbara strengthened into a hurricane around 1800 UTC on May 29 while located about 65 mi ( 105 km ) east @-@ southeast of Salina Cruz , Mexico . At its peak intensity as it was making landfall , it had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and a barometric pressure estimated at 983 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 03 inHg ) . With this intensity , Barbara made landfall on the coast of <unk> , Chiapas at approximately 1950 UTC . This marked both the easternmost and second earliest landfalling hurricane in the basin since reliable records began in 1966 . As Barbara moved inland within the Isthmus of Tehuantepec , rapid dissipation occurred . The cloud tops warmed and Barbara degenerated into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on May 30 . This was followed by a downgrade to tropical depression nine hours later as Barbara 's low @-@ level circulation was disrupted by the mountainous terrain . Very early on May 31 , the surface circulation of Barbara soon dissipated about 25 mi ( 40 km ) north @-@ northwest of Coatzacoalcos , Mexico , prior to emerging into the Gulf of Mexico .

 Immediately after developing into a tropical cyclone on May 28 , a tropical storm warning was issued by the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional along the coast of southern Mexico spanning from Lagunas de Chacahua National Park in Oaxaca to Boca de Pijijiapan , Chiapas . When the storm threatened to become a hurricane , a hurricane warning was declared for this region at 1025 UTC on May 29 . In Campeche , a blue ( minimal ) alert was issued . In Guatemala , a " preventive " alert was issued ; Barbara was similar to Hurricane Mitch and Tropical Storm Agatha ( both which devastated the nation ) and thus had the potential to produce flash floods . A yellow alert ( moderate risk ) was declared for central and southern Oaxaca and western Chiapas . For the southeastern and eastern part of Oaxaca and southwestern and central @-@ western Chiapas , a red ( high risk ) alert was issued . 
 Many shelters were opened adjacent to rivers . In Chiapas , 122 shelters opened , having a grand capacity of 300 @,@ 000 people though only 147 people used these shelters . In these shelters , officials set up 57 health centers . In Oaxaca , shelters were set up in 20 towns and hamlets . In all , coastal residents and marine interests were advised to take extreme caution in the states of Chiapas , Oaxaca , and Guerrero . In addition , classes were suspended in Oaxaca . Both large and small boats were anchored in Playa Manzanillo , to prevent being sunk by strong winds and rough seas , and water sports were suspended in Acapulco . Ports in Chiapas were also closed because of the storm .

 The precursor disturbance brought light to moderate rainfall to El Salvador . Many homes were damaged , roads were flooded , and several trees were downed . A 44 @-@ year @-@ old woman died when a tree fell on her . Strong winds and high waves damaged four homes in Barrio Playa , in the municipality of <unk> . As a result , shelters were opened , though only seven people sought refuge in them . This same disturbance brought landslides to Guatemala ; consequently , 30 people moved to shelters .

 Starting early on May 29 , the outer rainbands of Tropical Storm Barbara brought torrential rains to several states and power outages to Oaxaca , Chiapas , Guerrero , and Veracruz . Rainfall in the country peaked at 19 in ( 470 mm ) . In Ocosingo , 10 in ( 220 @.@ 5 mm ) fell in a 24 ‑ hour period . Upon making landfall , Barbara struck a largely undeveloped stretch of coastal lagoons , containing small fishing villages . In Acapulco , however , torrential rains caused severe flooding on roads leading to resorts , while damaging some highways . In all , considerable damage was reported . 
 Four people were killed in Oaxaca . A 61 @-@ year @-@ old American drowned offshore from rough seas . A 26 @-@ year @-@ old man died from drowning after attempting to cross a river . The third death was a 60 @-@ year @-@ old man in Salina Cruz . Furthermore , 14 fishermen went missing off the coast of <unk> two of which were quickly found alive . Within a few days following Barbara , eight of the remaining missing had been found alive . Of the four fishermen still unaccounted for , one was presumed to have died . The towns of Tonala and Arriaga were the worst affected by the hurricane , where dozens of trees , poles , billboards and roofs were damaged due to strong winds . Many restaurants were also destroyed because of high waves . Several homes were flooded . Many homes were destroyed , leaving many homeless . Throughout the rest of Chiapas , however , damage was minor . Statewide , 50 people were evacuated and 2 @,@ 000 homes were damaged . Throughout the region , 57 @,@ 000 people were homeless and 10 @,@ 000 ha ( 25 @,@ 000 acres ) of crops were destroyed . Approximately 3 @,@ 500 ha ( 8 @,@ 600 acres ) of mango crops , accounting for a total yield of 22 @,@ 751 @.@ 88 t ( 50 @,@ 159 @,@ 300 lb ) of mangoes , were destroyed , with losses estimated at 10 – 15 million pesos ( $ 750 @,@ 000 – $ 1 @.@ 1 million USD ) . 
 Following the storm , which affected 19 @,@ 000 people , 16 medical centers were opened , containing a combined 127 doctors and 318 nurses to provide medical care to devastated municipalities . A state of emergency was declared for 36 municipalities in Chiapas and for 5 municipalities in Oaxaca .

It was met with critical acclaim , ran for eight months , and saw Taylor receive two Tony Award nominations . 
 He also had numerous television roles , appearing in The Simpsons , Twin Peaks , Ally McBeal and L.A. Law . His performance in the latter , as a singer who performed the American national anthem " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " at baseball games , led him to perform the anthem at several real @-@ life sporting events .

 Taylor , a " barrel @-@ chested bass @-@ baritone " , had an extensive career in musical theater . Upon graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts , Taylor was unable to read sheet music and could " barely " play the piano , but found work as a singer . In 1977 he played the Cowardly Lion in a national touring production of The Wiz . Taylor subsequently played Great Big Baby in the 1978 Broadway production Eubie ! and Caiaphas in a performance of Jesus Christ Superstar . 
 He voiced Audrey II , the " street @-@ smart , funky , conniving " talking killer plant which is an " anthropomorphic cross between a Venus flytrap and an avocado " , in the original off @-@ Broadway production of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken 's " black @-@ comedy musical " Little Shop of Horrors from 1982 . Audrey II was played by four increasingly large puppets , operated by Martin P. Robinson , while Taylor sat in a box at the back of the stage to voice the role , standing to perform his musical numbers . The two kept in close proximity to ensure " that voice and action are always synchronized " and " developed a rapport " which was " the only thing that allow [ ed ] the character to really bloom . " Taylor disliked sitting in the box as it left him feeling disconnected from the audience . The part was his break and was described by Jesse McKinley of The New York Times as " a role Mr. Taylor 's booming voice was made for ... [ he ] soon put his stamp on Audrey 's signature line : ' Feed me , feed me ! ' " Members of the public often used the line when they saw Taylor . Little Shop of Horrors was performed over 2000 times before it closed in 1987 . At the 1983 Drama Desk Awards , Taylor won the award for Outstanding Special Effects for his performance , which he shared with Robinson . 
 In the 1984 Broadway production of The Three Musketeers at The Broadway Theatre , Taylor played Porthos , one of the three title characters . After fifteen preview performances , the show ran just nine times before closing . Frank Rich wrote that the musketeers were " professionally played " by Taylor and his co @-@ stars Brent Spiner and Chuck Wagner but felt the three had " little dialogue and often seem like interchangeable stand @-@ ins for the Three Stooges . " A similar view was held by William B. Collins of the Philadelphia Inquirer who said they " speak as in one voice and behave like comedians who have been stranded without good material . " 
 = = = = It Ain 't Nothin ' But the Blues = = = = 
 Taylor created and starred in the musical revue It Ain 't Nothin ' But the Blues , which charted the history of blues music from its African origin to American success . He conceived the original idea for the show when he played blues musician Rufus Payne in a 1987 production of Lost Highway , a play about singer Hank Williams at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts in Denver , Colorado . He proposed the idea to director Randal Myler who eventually accepted it in 1994 . Taylor co @-@ wrote the revue with Myler , Lita <unk> , Charles Bevel and Dan <unk> , and also served as its associate producer . Taylor was the revue 's lead singer and acted as its narrator ; his numbers included " I 'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man " , " The Thrill is Gone " , " Blues Man " and " Let the Good Times Roll " . It was initially performed as a 45 @-@ minute production at 25 local high schools . Because of their positive reception , the show was expanded to two hours and 50 songs , with three people being added to the original cast of four , and was regularly performed at the Denver Center . 
 Taylor described the performance as " very cordial " , with the audience close to performers , and that " one show is never the same as the next because of the songs , of what they are . Blues is about how you feel today . One day , you 're down ; another day is real happy and giddy . We 're all laughing . Randy 's direction captures that . It 's always so personal , bringing the audience into the piece . " As well as African music , the revue includes " country , gospel , the old blues , Appalachian music , " featuring music by Patsy Cline , Brenda Lee , Mahalia Jackson , Jimmy Rogers , Nina Simone and Muddy Waters . 
 In 1995 , the revue ran for a month at the Cleveland Play House , in conjunction with the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum , before touring at other regional theaters . It played at the Crossroads Theatre in New Jersey for seven weeks in November 1998 and opened off @-@ Broadway at New York 's New Victory Theater in March 1999 , presented by Crossroads Theatre , in association with San Diego Repertory Theatre and Alabama Shakespeare Festival . It was met with critical and audience acclaim and the following month moved to Broadway to the Vivian Beaumont Theater . New York Times critic Lawrence Van Gelder wrote that the show had a " cornucopia of splendidly interpreted song , " and " is a potent blend of visual eloquence and historical sweep that engages the eye and touches the heart while its songs soothe the ear , occasionally work mischief on the funny bone , and always raise the spirits . " 
 A week after opening at the Beaumont , the show received four Tony Award nominations , with Taylor being nominated for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical and Best Book of a Musical . The cast 's performance on the live Tony Awards show on CBS was bumped due to limited time , sparking controversy , costing the show potential revenue , and damaging its prospects for survival . The cast performed two days later on the CBS talkshow Late Show with David Letterman , while media attention and radio coverage of the Tony snub boosted the show 's takings for the following two weeks . This did not last and did not " build a long @-@ lasting audience like the Tonys could " , leading to dwindling attendance . A large word @-@ of @-@ mouth networking campaign to advertise the performance was set up by the producers and the show moved to the Ambassador Theatre , where the box office takes began to break even . The show closed in January 2000 after a total run of eight months on Broadway . 
 For the rest of the year , It Ain 't Nothin ' But the Blues again toured at regional theaters , running in Atlanta , San Diego , and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. , and returning to New York in August 2000 at the B.B. King Blues Club and Grill for a month @-@ long run . Jim <unk> of The Press @-@ Enterprise , in a review of one of the San Diego performances , praised Taylor , saying he " has the lung power to simply take over any show , especially his own " and " shows surprising grace and athleticism as well as the kind of leonine masculinity that certain big men ( Orson Welles , Babe Ruth ) possess " . <unk> also praised the writing , calling it " a superb job not only of selecting the songs , but in choosing arrangements that blow away all the cobwebs history has laid on many of them . " 
 It Ain 't Nothin ' But the Blues was the longest @-@ running show Taylor appeared in , as well as his final Broadway appearance . Taylor planned an IMAX film version of the production ; and nine years after his death , it was revived by the New Haarlem Arts Theater at the Aaron Davis Hall on the City College of New York campus .

 Taylor had numerous television roles . He voiced jazz musician " Bleeding Gums " Murphy on The Simpsons , appearing in the first season episode " Moaning Lisa " ( 1990 ) and returning for the character 's death in the season six episode " ' Round Springfield " ( 1995 ) . He was one of the first people to guest star on the show . Taylor was supposed to reprise his role in the season two episode " Dancin ' Homer " , but was in New York and unable to record his part . Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said the role gave Taylor " television immortality " . He also reprised the role on a recording of Billie Holiday 's song " God Bless the Child " on the 1990 The Simpsons ' album The Simpsons Sing the Blues . He appeared as a Klingon chef in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , and played wrestling instructor Coach Wingate in Twin Peaks . He received an in memoriam at the end of " Sweets and Sour Marge , " with an image of the Bleeding Gums Murphy character and the text " Ron Taylor 1952 @-@ 2002 " ( season 13 , episode 9 ) . This was the first episode after his death and unrelated to the episode topic of " big sugar . " Other television roles included guest spots on NYPD Blue , ER , Profiler , Family Matters , Home Improvement and Ally McBeal . Taylor also had a recurring part in the 2000 series City of Angels , and played a blues singer in a two @-@ part episode of Matlock , a role that was written for him . He also appeared in more than 20 films . These included Trading Places , Amos & Andrew , A Rage in Harlem ( as Hank ) , The Mighty Quinn and Rush Hour 2 . 
 After a 1991 appearance on the series L.A. Law , on which he played a singer sacked by a baseball team for " embellish [ ing ] " his performances of the American national anthem " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " , Taylor received several invitations to sing it before sports events , although never expected anything to happen when he had taken the part . He sang it before the Major League Baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and Detroit Tigers on July 1 , 1991 . His rendition did not mimic that of his character : " the song is self @-@ explanatory . I 'm just going to sing the song straightforwardly and that 's that . " Taylor received travel and accommodation expenses but no other payment for his performance . He also sang for a Los Angeles Kings National Hockey League game , and on August 5 , 1995 he sang the anthem before the MLB match between the Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox . 
 Taylor was part of the blues group The <unk> Bros and performed across the United States . He also sang with Billy Joel , Bruce Springsteen , Etta James , Slash and Sheila E ..

 Taylor met <unk> Sharpe in 1977 during the production of The Wiz where she was the understudy for Dorothy . They married in 1980 and had a son , <unk> . In his spare time , Taylor often helped teach vulnerable young people through a variety of projects , including at the George Street Playhouse in New Jersey . He noted " things have come out of the air for me ... I 'm grateful ; that 's why I work with kids . I 've had a blessing in my career , to have gone as far as I 've gone . " A 1995 piece in The Plain Dealer described Taylor as " A jolly giant of a man , he looks like a natural force – a mountain , perhaps , who can tell great stories . " Taylor was a Christian . 
 Taylor suffered a small stroke in 1999 ; he was able to perform again in It Ain 't Nothin ' But the Blues 73 days later . He died of a heart attack aged 49 , on January 16 , 2002 , at his home in Los Angeles , California . His funeral took place on January 28 at the New Christ Memorial Church of God and Christ .

 = History of Aston Villa F.C. ( 1874 – 1961 ) = 
 The history of Aston Villa Football Club between 1874 and 1961 covers their time from the club 's foundation , through the first two major periods of success ( the late 1880s , and the early 1900s ) and the club 's League Cup success . 
 Aston Villa Football Club were formed in March 1874 , by four members of the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel ( known as early as 1867 as Aston Villa Wesleyan Chapel ) in Handsworth . The four founders were Jack Hughes , Frederick Matthews , Walter Price and William Scattergood . The first match was against the local Aston Brook St Mary 's Rugby team . As a condition of the match , the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under rugby rules and the second half under football rules . The club were soon playing the modern version of football though and the club won its first FA Cup in 1887 . Aston Villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in 1888 with one of the club 's directors , William McGregor being the league 's founder . Aston Villa emerged as the most successful English club of the Victorian era . By the end of Villa 's " Golden Age " at the start of the First World War , the club had won the League Championship six times and the FA Cup five times . 
 Aston Villa won their sixth FA Cup in 1920 . For the remainder of the inter @-@ war years though , Villa were on a slow decline that would lead to them being relegated to the Second Division in 1936 for the first time in their history . They returned to the top @-@ tier of English football by the outbreak of the Second World War . As with many clubs , the war brought much change to Villa Park and remainder of the 1940s were spent rebuilding the team . By 1957 , Villa were a Cup winning side once again with the clubs seventh FA Cup win . Even though Villa won the inaugural League Cup in 1960 , the club were to enter into a very unsuccessful period . The 1960s saw much change at Villa Park . By the end of the 1960s , Villa were languishing in the Second Division and fan pressure led to the resignation of the Board and the introduction of Doug Ellis as Villa Chairman . 
 = = Formation by Villa Cross Cricketers = = 
 Club folklore has it that Aston Villa Football Club was formed by four players from the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel cricket team . It is said that they " met in 1874 under a gas @-@ light in Heathfield Road " to set about forming a new club . They were looking for something to keep them occupied during the winter . The club 's official history states that they chose football after witnessing an " impromptu game on a meadow off Heathfield Road " . The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes , Frederick Matthews , Walter Price and William Scattergood . Their first match was played against the local Aston Brook St Mary 's Rugby team on Wilson Road , Aston . As a condition of the match , the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under rugby rules , and the second half under football rules . The game was a scoreless draw at half time but Jack Hughes scored a goal in the second half to ensure that Villa won their first ever game . Villa moved to their first official home , Wellington Road in Perry Barr , in 1876 after their captain , George Ramsay , noted that in order to progress , Villa would need to move into an enclosed ground to be able to collect gate money . The site was taken on a three @-@ year lease at a rent of £ 7 @,@ 10 shillings for the first year , rising to £ 15 and £ 20 in subsequent years . By the late 1870s , Villa were improving greatly and by 1880 , Villa won their first senior honour when they won the Birmingham Senior Cup under the captaincy of Scotsman Ramsay . 
 = = Rise to prominence = = 
 The club won its first FA Cup in 1887 , under the captaincy of another Scotsman , Archie Hunter . They beat West Bromwich Albion 2 – 0 in the final held at The Oval . Up until 1885 , football had remained an amateur sport . It turned professional in 1885 , when the FA legalized professional football , but with a national wage limit . However , the Scottish draper and director of Aston Villa , William McGregor had become frustrated with watching his team in one @-@ sided friendly matches and low attendances for all games but FA Cup ties . He saw that in order to keep interest in the game alive , the top teams needed to play each other in a league much like American baseball teams did . McGregor wrote to the twelve leading clubs in England proposing the formation of a league . The reason the Football League was never called the English League is because McGregor intended that Scottish and Welsh teams would eventually join . In the end , some Welsh teams joined , most notably Cardiff City , but Scottish teams did not . Aston Villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in 1888 . Villa 's first League game came on 8 September 1888 , when they drew 1 – 1 Wolverhampton Wanderers as Tom Green scored the club 's first League goal . Villa finished runners @-@ up to Preston North End in that inaugural season . 
 = = Victorian and Edwardian eras = = 
 It did not take long for Villa to lift their first League Championship trophy , and this was achieved in 1893 – 94 . Villa were soon attracting large crowds ; the club could regularly expect 25 @,@ 000 people to attend home games . This was at a time when the FA Cup Final would attract only about 20 @,@ 000 . With poor spectator facilities and an uneven pitch , the Wellington Road ground was increasingly unsuitable , and in 1897 Villa 's financial secretary Frederick Rinder negotiated the purchase of their current home ground , the Aston Lower Grounds . In the 1899 @-@ 1900 season Billy Garraty became the top goalscorer in world football scoring 27 goals in just 33 league games and a total 30 goals in 39 league and cup games . The name of Villa Park was not used until about 1900 . It came about through fan usage and no official declaration was made that listed the name as Villa Park . The ground was not purchased outright until 1911 . 
 Villa began the 20th century as champions but the gap that distinguished them from their competitors was diminishing . Football in England was becoming more competitive as more teams formed . Villa did remain a significant force in the game though . Despite a run of four victories at the start of the 1900 – 01 season , Villa finished fourth from bottom . In the 1902 – 03 season Villa won 12 of their last 15 games to finish only one point behind champions Sheffield Wednesday . In 1905 , Villa won the FA Cup with a then record crowd of 101 @,@ 117 watching the match at Crystal Palace , where Villa beat Newcastle United 2 – 0 . In the same season , Villa finished fourth and this helped to boost the coffers at the club . After the success of 1905 , Villa went through a barren patch and it was not until the 1909 – 10 season that Villa threatened to regain the title . In that season , they beat the reigning champions Manchester United 7 – 1 . Villa won the championship for the first time in 10 years to take a then record , sixth title . The 1910 – 11 season was very close and the title was decided on the last day of the season when Villa lost to Liverpool and Manchester United beat Sunderland to take the title . The following season , Villa finished sixth . Yet in 1913 , Villa won the FA Cup for a then record @-@ equalling fifth time . By the end of what was to be called Villa 's golden era , when the First World War began , the club had won the League Championship six times and the FA Cup five times . This included the League and Cup Double in 1896 – 97 , a feat which would not be repeated for more than 60 years .
