 = Foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong = 
 Foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong ( Chinese : <unk> ) are domestic workers employed by Hongkongers , typically families . About three percent of Hong Kong 's population , an overwhelming majority are women . In 2013 , there were 320 @,@ 000 foreign domestic helpers in the territory ; of these , 48 percent were from the Philippines , 49 @.@ 4 percent from Indonesia and 1 @.@ 3 percent from Thailand . Required by law to live in their employer 's residence , they perform household tasks such as cooking , serving , cleaning , dishwashing and child care . 
 Since October 2003 the employment of domestic workers has been subject to the unpopular Employees ' Retraining Levy , totalling HK $ 9 @,@ 600 for a two @-@ year contract . It has not been applied since 16 July 2008 , and has since been abolished . Whether foreign workers should be able to apply for Hong Kong residency is the subject of debate , and a high @-@ profile court battle for residency by a foreign worker failed . 
 The condition of foreign domestic workers is being increasingly scrutinised by human @-@ rights groups and criticised as tantamount to modern slavery . Documented cases of worker abuse , including the successful prosecution of an employer for subjecting Erwiana Sulistyaningsih to grievous bodily harm , assault , criminal intimidation and unpaid wages , are increasing in number . In March 2016 , an NGO , Justice Centre , reported its findings that one domestic worker in six in Hong Kong were deemed to have been forced into labour . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 In Hong Kong Cantonese , <unk> ( maid ) and <unk> ( foreign servant ) are neutral , socially @-@ acceptable words for foreign domestic helpers . Fei <unk> ( <unk> , Filipino servant ) referred to foreign domestic helpers , regardless of origin , at a time when most were from the Philippines . The slang term bun <unk> ( <unk> , Pinoy girl ) is widely used by local residents . 
 In Chinese @-@ language government documentation , foreign domestic helpers are referred to as <unk> ( domestic workers ) " of foreign nationality " ( <unk> ) or " recruited from abroad " ( <unk> ) . Although the government uses words with the same meanings in English @-@ language documentation , it substitutes the term " domestic helper " for " domestic worker " . Director of the Bethune House shelter for domestic workers <unk> Antonio has criticised the term " helper " , saying that the migrants do dirty jobs ; calling them " helpers " strips them of the dignity accorded workers and implies that they can be mistreated , like slaves . 
 = = History = = 
 Faced with a poor economy in 1974 , Filipino President , Ferdinand Marcos implemented a labour code which began his country 's export of labour in the form of overseas workers . The Philippine government encouraged this labour export to reduce the unemployment rate and enrich its treasury with the workers ' remittances . The economy of the Philippines became increasingly dependent on labour export ; in 1978 labour @-@ export recruiting agencies were privatised , and became a cornerstone of the economy . 
 Increasing labour export from the Philippines coincided with the economic rise of Hong Kong during the late 1970s and early 1980s . When the People 's Republic of China implemented wide @-@ reaching economic reform in the late 1970s and initiated trade with other countries , Hong Kong became mainland China 's biggest investor . Labour @-@ intensive Hong Kong industries moved to the mainland , and high @-@ profit service industries in the territory ( such as design , marketing and finance ) expanded dramatically . To deal with the resulting labour shortage and increase in labour costs , the female labour force was mobilised . Two @-@ income families sought help to manage their households , creating a demand for domestic workers . Female participation in the workforce increased , from 47 @.@ 5 percent in 1982 to 54 @.@ 7 percent in 2013 . Families began hiring foreign domestic workers from the Philippines , with the number of workers steadily increasing during the 1980s and 1990s . 
 = = Prevalence and demographics = = 
 Singapore , Hong Kong and Taiwan are considered attractive destinations by those seeking employment as domestic workers . According to Quartz , Hong Kong has one of the highest densities of foreign domestic workers in the world and its pay scale is a benchmark for other jurisdictions . Since the mid @-@ 1970s , when the foreign @-@ domestic @-@ helper policy was initiated , the number of workers has increased to around 300 @,@ 000 . At the end of 2013 , there was an average of one foreign domestic worker for every eight households overall ; in households with children , the average is one for every three . Foreign domestic helpers are about 10 percent of the working population . In December 2014 the number of migrant workers employed as helpers was over 330 @,@ 000 , 4 @.@ 6 percent of the total population ; the vast majority were female . 
 Before the 1980s and increased prosperity on the mainland , Chinese domestic workers were dominant . Until the 1990s , workers then came primarily from the Philippines ; the percentage is now shifting from Philippine workers to Indonesian and other nationalities . During the 1990s Indonesia and Thailand followed the Filipino model of labour export to deal with domestic economic crises , and Hong Kong families began hiring workers from those countries as well . The Indonesians provided competition , since those workers were often prepared to accept half the minimum wage . 
 According to the Immigration Department , in 1998 there were 140 @,@ 357 Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong and 31 @,@ 762 from Indonesia . In 2005 , official figures indicated 223 @,@ 394 " foreign domestic helpers " in the territory ; 53 @.@ 11 percent were from the Philippines , 43 @.@ 15 percent from Indonesia and 2 @.@ 05 percent from Thailand . In 2010 , the respective numbers were 136 @,@ 723 from the Philippines ( 48 percent ) , 140 @,@ 720 from Indonesia ( 49 @.@ 4 percent ) , 3 @,@ 744 from Thailand ( 1 @.@ 3 percent ) , 893 Sri Lankans , 568 Nepalese and 2 @,@ 253 of other nationalities . Vietnamese are not permitted to work in Hong Kong as domestic workers for what authorities call " security reasons " linked to ( according to one lawmaker ) historical problems with Vietnamese refugees . 
 Attempts to import workers from Myanmar and Bangladesh have failed . Indonesian president Joko Widodo has reportedly said that he considers the export of domestic labour a national embarrassment , pledging that his government will end the practice . In February 2015 there were 331 @,@ 989 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong , of which 166 @,@ 743 were from the Philippines – an increase of 7 @,@ 000 from the previous year , with the number of Indonesians remaining static . 
 = = Recruitment = = 
 Foreign domestic workers are recruited primarily by a large number of specialised agencies , with local firms connected to correspondents in the workers ' home countries . Agencies are paid by employers and workers , and are regulated according to the Employment Ordinance and Employment Agency Regulations . Local agencies dealing with workers from the Philippines are accredited by the Philippine consulate . To hire an Indonesian worker , an employer must use an agent ; there is no similar requirement for Filipino workers . Although agency fees are regulated by law to 10 percent of one month 's salary , some agencies in the workers ' countries charge commissions and " training " fees which take several months to pay off . The Philippine government outlawed commissions in 2006 , and employment agencies may only charge fees . 
 = = Employment regulations = = 
 The government of Hong Kong has drawn up rules and regulations concerning the employment , labour and conditions of stay of foreign domestic helpers . Since 2003 , all foreign domestic helpers are required by law to be live @-@ in . An employer and employee are required to enter into a standard , two @-@ year contract specifically for the employment of foreign domestic helpers . Employer regulations include : 
 Household income of at least HK $ 15 @,@ 000 ( US $ 1 @,@ 920 ) per month for each foreign domestic helper employed 
 A levy of HK $ 9 @,@ 600 for employing a foreign domestic helper , for the duration of a 2 @-@ year contract ( abolished 31 July 2013 ) 
 Free medical treatment for the foreign domestic helper 
 A monthly salary of no less than the minimum allowable wage set by the government 
 Helpers ' rights and obligations include : 
 To perform only the domestic duties outlined in the employment contract 
 To not accept other employment during the effective period of the contract 
 To work and live in the employer 's place of residence , and to be provided with suitable living accommodation with reasonable privacy 
 One rest day ( a continuous period of not less than 24 hours ) every week 
 = = = Minimum allowable wage = = = 
 Foreign domestic workers ' wages are subject to a statutory minimum , a breach of which is <unk> under the Employment Ordinance . An employer convicted of paying less than the minimum allowable wage ( MAW ) is subject to a maximum fine of HK $ 350 @,@ 000 and three years ' imprisonment . 
 Helpers ' minimum wages are inflation @-@ adjusted annually for contracts about to be signed , and apply for the duration of the contract . They were reduced by HK $ 190 ( five percent ) in 1999 . In April 2003 , another deflationary period , the government announced a HK $ 400 reduction in pay ( to HK $ 3 @,@ 270 ) " due to the steady drop in a basket of economic indicators since 1999 . " The minimum allowable wage was raised by HK $ 80 , to HK $ 3 @,@ 480 per month , for contracts signed on or after 6 June 2007 . Another HK $ 100 cost @-@ of @-@ living adjustment took effect for all employment contracts signed on or after 10 July 2008 , increasing the minimum wage to HK $ 3 @,@ 580 per month . The minimum allowable wage was reset to HK $ 3 @,@ 740 per month on 2 June 2011 , and raised to HK $ 3 @,@ 920 per month for contracts signed from 20 September 2012 onwards . 
 The MAW has been criticised by workers ' and welfare groups for making <unk> second @-@ class citizens . The statutory minimum wage does not apply to them ; although the MAW is HK $ 3 @,@ 920 , a local worker working a 48 @-@ hour week would earn HK $ 6 @,@ 240 if paid at the minimum hourly wage of HK $ 30 ( as of 30 March 2015 ) . The International Domestic Workers Federation has complained that the MAW rose by only 3 @.@ 9 percent ( or HK $ 150 ) from 1998 to 2012 , failing to keep pace with Hong Kong 's median monthly income ( which rose over 15 percent during the same period ) . Since Hong Kong is a benchmark market for Asian migrant workers , there is pressure to keep wages low . Wages were also held in check by competition from Indonesian workers , who began arriving in large numbers during the 1990s . Since then , workers from other Asian countries ( such as Bangladesh and Nepal ) may be willing to work for less than the MAW . 
 = = = Employees ' Retraining Levy = = = 
 During a recession in October 2003 , the Hong Kong government imposed a HK $ 400 monthly Employees ' Retraining Levy for hiring a foreign domestic helper under the Employees Retraining Ordinance . The tax , proposed by the Liberal Party in 2002 to tackle a fiscal deficit , was introduced by Donald Tsang as part of the government 's population policy when he was Chief Secretary for Administration . Although Tsang called foreign and local domestic workers two distinct labour markets , he said : " Employers of foreign domestic helpers should play a role in helping Hong Kong in ... upgrading the local workforce . " 
 According to Government Policy Support and Strategic Planning , the levy would be used to retrain the local workforce and improve their employment opportunities . The government said that the extension of the levy to domestic helpers would remove the disparity between imported and local workers . According to The Standard , it was hoped that fewer foreign maids would be employed in Hong Kong . The Senate of the Philippines disagreed with the Hong Kong government , denounced the levy as " discriminatory " and hinted that it would take the issue to the International Labour Organization . Senate president Franklin Drilon said that a tax on domestic workers countered Hong Kong 's free @-@ market principles and would damage its reputation for openness to foreign trade , investment and services . 
 Earlier that year the minimum wage for foreign domestic helpers was lowered by the same amount , although the government said the reduction in the minimum wage and imposition of the levy were " unrelated " ; lawyers for the government called the moves an " unfortunate coincidence " . The measure was expected to bring HK $ 150 million annually into government coffers . 
 Thousands of workers , fearing that the financial burden would be passed to them , protested the measures . The government , defending the measures as necessary in Hong Kong 's changing economy , said that foreign domestic workers were still better paid than their counterparts in other Asian countries ; according to James Tien , the monthly wage of Filipina maids in Singapore was about HK $ 1 @,@ 400 and $ 1 @,@ 130 in Malaysia . 
 In 2004 a legal challenge was mounted , asserting that the levy on employers was unlawful as a discriminatory tax . In January 2005 High Court Justice Michael Hartmann ruled that since the levy was instituted by law it was not a tax , but a fee for the privilege of employing non @-@ local workers ( who would not otherwise be permitted to work in Hong Kong ) . In 2007 the Liberal Party urged the government to abolish the Employees ' Retraining Levy as a part of its District @-@ Council election platform , saying that the HK $ 3 @.@ 26 billion fund should be used as originally intended : to retrain employees . In an August 2008 South China Morning Post column , Chris Yeung called the case for retaining the levy increasingly morally and financially weak : " Middle class people feel a sense of injustice about the levy " . According to Regina Ip , the levy had lost its raison d 'être . In 2013 the government abolished the levy in the Chief Executive 's policy address , effective 31 July . 
 = = Levy waiver controversy = = 
 As part of " extraordinary measures for extraordinary times " ( totalling HK $ 11 billion ) announced by Donald Tsang on 16 July 2008 , the levy would be temporarily waived at an estimated cost of HK $ 2 billion . In the Chinese press , the measures were mockingly called <unk> ( handing out candy ) . 
 The levy would be waived for a two @-@ year period on all helpers ' employment contracts signed on or after 1 September 2008 , and would not apply to existing contracts . The Immigration Department said it would not reimburse levies , which are prepaid <unk> . The announcement resulted in confusion and uncertainty for workers . Before Tsang 's October policy address , Chris Yeung called the waiver a " gimmick dressed up as an economic relief initiative , designed to boost the administration 's popularity " . 
 Maids ' representatives said that when the waiver was announced , the guidelines were unclear and had no implementation date . Employers deferred contracts or dismissed workers pending confirmation of the effective date , leaving them in limbo . They protested the uncertainty , demanding an increase in their minimum wage to HK $ 4 @,@ 000 . Employers reportedly began terminating their helpers ' contracts , stoking fears of mass terminations . On 20 July Secretary for Labour and Welfare Matthew Cheung announced that the waiver commencement date would be moved up by one month , and the Immigration Department temporarily relaxed its 14 @-@ day re @-@ employment requirement for helpers whose contracts had expired . 
 On 30 July the Executive Council approved the suspension of the levy for two years , from 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2010 . After widespread criticism , the government said that maids with advanced contract renewals would not be required to leave Hong Kong ; employers would benefit from the waiver by renewing contracts within the two @-@ year period . According to the government , some employers could benefit from the waiver for up to four years . The effect of turning a two @-@ year moratorium into four @-@ year suspension was denounced by newspapers across the political spectrum , and the levy itself was called " farcical " in a South China Morning Post editorial . Stephen Vines wrote : " The plan for a two @-@ year suspension of the levy ... provides an almost perfect example of government dysfunction and arrogance " , and Albert Cheng said that the controversy exposed " worst side of our government bureaucracy " . Columnist Frank Ching criticised senior officials for living in ivory towers , and said that there would have been no disruption if the government had suspended payment immediately and repaid those who had prepaid . Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor called for the levy 's permanent abolition , saying that the temporary two @-@ year waiver was discriminatory and criticising the confusion and inconvenience caused to employers by the Immigration Department because the policy had not been thought through .

 On the morning of 1 August the Immigration Department issued 2 @,@ 180 passes to workers and agents to collect visas and submit applications to work in Hong Kong , promising to handle all applications submitted . Offices opened one hour earlier than usual , added staff and extended their hours to guarantee that all 2 @,@ 180 cases would be processed . The Philippine consulate also expected a large workload as a result of the rehiring provisions . Chinese newspapers published articles calculating how households could maximise their benefits under the waiver rules . Street protests on 3 August decried the waiver 's unfairness and its burden on the Immigration Department . According to one protester , the waiver would teach households how to use legal loopholes . 
 The West Kowloon Immigration office in Yau Ma Tei processed 5 @,@ 000 advance contract renewals and 7 @,@ 400 regular renewals in August 2008 . Despite the availability of online booking for slots at its five branch offices , the daily quota on the number of applications being processed resulted in overnight queues . Positions in the waiting line were illegally sold for up to HK $ 120 . 
 = = = = Legislative Council debate = = = = 
 The government was required to move an amendment in the Legislative Council ( LegCo ) to suspend the levy in accordance with the Executive Council decision . Faced with calls to abolish the levy , the government was adamantly opposed ; according to the Secretary for Labour and Welfare , the HK $ 5 billion fund would only support the Employment Retraining Board for four or five years if the levy was permanently waived . 
 Regina Ip began a campaign to abolish the levy , and tabled an amendment at LegCo . The government said that it would attempt to rule it out of order on the grounds that it would breach rule 31 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedures , which prohibit amendments impacting government revenue . Ip compared this stance with a 2005 High Court decision that the Employees ' Retraining Levy was not a tax . According to the government , a bill to abolish the levy would breach Article 74 of Hong Kong Basic Law and it would take Article 74 to the central government for interpretation . Legislators and commentators called this proposal a " nuclear bomb " , and a University of Hong Kong academic said that reinterpretation would be a " totally disproportionate ... route to resolve this dispute . " 
 Under pressure from legislators , the government ( through the Executive Council ) agreed to extend the levy 's suspension from two to five years . The amendment for the five @-@ year suspension , one of several proposed amendments to the Employees Retraining Ordinance Notice 2008 , was tabled by the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong and would apply to first @-@ time and renewed contracts and visas issued between 1 August 2008 and 31 July 2013 . 
 = = Grievances = = 
 Foreign domestic workers and their supporters , including activists and employers , have periodically staged rallies protesting what they perceive as discriminatory treatment on the part of the Hong Kong government . Grievances include discrimination , the minimum wage and the two @-@ week stay limit at the end of a domestic worker 's employment contract . According to the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor ( <unk> ) , foreign domestic helpers face discrimination from the Hong Kong government and their employers . 
 A 2013 Amnesty International report on Indonesian migrant domestic workers , " Exploited For Profit , Failed By Governments – Indonesian Migrant Domestic Workers <unk> To Hong Kong " , suggested that they may be the victims of serious human- and labour @-@ rights violations in Hong Kong and some regulations make the problem worse . Abuses noted by AI include confiscation of travel documents , lack of privacy , pay below the Minimum Allowable Wage and being " on call " at all hours . Many are subjected to physical and verbal abuse by their employers , and are forced to work seven days a week . 
 = = = Systemic exploitation = = = 
 Many migrant workers have little education , little knowledge of the law and their rights , and leave home to support their families . They fall victim to agents ( official and unofficial ) , unscrupulous officials and a lack of legal protection at home and in their host countries . The debts they incur to secure employment overseas may lock them in a cycle of abuse and exploitation . 
 There is criticism in the Philippines that the country is one of the biggest human traffickers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations . In the Manila Standard , Alejandro Del Rosario criticised the government for continuing its 1960s policy of labour export instead of focussing on domestic production and job creation ( allowing the program to expand , contributing to the brain drain ) . Amnesty International suggests that a lack of oversight allows criminal syndicates to profit from foreign workers , who are often unaware of their legal rights in their host country . AI 's 2013 report alleges that many Indonesians are victims of forced human trafficking , and criticises the Indonesian and Hong Kong governments for having " failed to take adequate action to enforce domestic legislation in their own territories which could have protected migrant workers from trafficking , exploitation and forced labour ... In particular , they have not properly monitored , regulated or punished recruitment and placement agencies who are not complying with the law . " 
 In 2014 and 2015 several incidents involving worker mistreatment surfaced , indicating that employment agencies often neglect workers ' rights or are complicit in the cycle of abuse ; there have also been many instances of failure to provide service to employers . According to media reports , between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies . Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided , to the extent that it was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers ' experience . The 2015 death of Elis <unk> , awaiting her work visa before beginning employment , exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations ; <unk> was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point . Worker protections against illegal fees , unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate . 
 = = = Right of abode = = = 
 Under the Immigration Ordinance a foreigner may be eligible to apply for permanent residency after having " ordinarily resided " in Hong Kong for seven continuous years , and thus enjoy the right of abode in Hong Kong . However , the definition of " ordinary residency " excludes ( amongst other groups ) those who lived in the territory as foreign domestic helpers ; this effectively denied foreign workers the rights of permanent residents ( including the right to vote ) , even if they had lived in Hong Kong for many years . Since 1997 , section 2 ( 4 ) of the Immigration Ordinance has stated that " a person shall not be treated as ordinarily resident in Hong Kong while employed as a domestic helper who is from outside Hong Kong " . In 2011 , the issue of foreign workers applying for Hong Kong residency was debated ; since one million families live under the poverty line in the territory , some political parties argued that Hong Kong has insufficient welfare funding to support 300 @,@ 000 foreign workers if they can apply for public housing and social @-@ welfare benefits . The Court of First Instance found in <unk> v Commissioner of Registration that this definition of " ordinarily resident " contravenes Article 24 of the Basic Law . The latter stipulates , " Persons not of Chinese nationality who have entered Hong Kong with valid travel documents , have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years and have taken Hong Kong as their place of permanent residence before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region " , feeding speculation that domestic helpers could obtain the right of abode . An appeal was made to the Court of Appeal of the High Court , which overturned the judgment of the Court of First Instance . The plaintiffs then appealed to the Court of Final Appeal , which ruled against them in a unanimous judgment . 
 = = = Two @-@ week rule = = = 
 The government requires foreign domestic helpers to leave Hong Kong within two weeks of the termination of their employment contract , unless they find another employer ( the two @-@ week rule ) . According to Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor , this is a form of discrimination against foreign domestic helpers ( who are almost all Southeast Asian ) ; this limitation is not enforced for other foreign workers . The two @-@ week rule has been condemned by two United Nations committees : the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . 
 According to human @-@ rights groups , the two @-@ week rule may pressure workers to remain with abusive employers . In 2005 , the UN Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights urged the government to " review the existing ' two @-@ week rule ' ... and to improv [ e ] the legal protection and benefits for foreign domestic workers so that they are in line with those afforded to local workers , particularly with regard to wages and retirement benefits . " The following year , the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women called on the government to " repeal the ' two @-@ week rule ' and to implement a more flexible policy regarding foreign domestic workers . It also calls upon the state party to strengthen its control of employment agencies and to provide migrant workers with easily accessible avenues of redress against abuse by employers and permit them to stay in the country while seeking redress . " The two @-@ week and live @-@ in rules were criticised by the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2013 . 
 = = = Abuse by employers = = = 
 Although the Hong Kong government has enacted legislation which nominally protects migrant workers , recourse is time @-@ consuming and the costs considerable . The legal process can take up to 15 months to reach the District Court or Labour Tribunal , during which workers have no income . 
 Welfare groups have expressed concerns about the treatment of this segment of the Hong Kong workforce , and the 2014 Erwiana Sulistyaningsih abuse case ( which attracted international news headlines ) focused on the plight of foreign workers in the territory . Thousands took to the streets , demanding justice for Sulistyaningsih . Although the government calls her case an isolated one , welfare groups say that many workers are victims of " modern @-@ day slavery " and abuse by employers . Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor reported that a substantial percentage of workers are mistreated by their employers ; of 2 @,@ 500 workers interviewed , at least 25 percent said they had experienced violations of their contract ( including pay less than the MAW and being denied their mandatory weekly day of rest and statutory holidays ) . More than 25 percent had also experienced physical and verbal abuse , including a " significant incidence " of sexual abuse . According to Caritas Hong Kong , their Asian Migrant Worker Social Service Project helpline received over four thousand calls from workers and 53 workers received assistance to remain in Hong Kong and pursue their claims . According to <unk> House executive director <unk> Antonio , the shelter dealt with 7 @,@ 000 cases of alleged abuse in the first three @-@ quarters of 2013 ( compared with 3 @,@ 000 for all of 2012 ) . 
 Contributing factors include " artificially low wages " and the live @-@ in requirement . Many workers accumulate six to twelve months ' debt to intermediaries for commissions , although these commissions are limited by law to 10 percent of the first month 's pay . The ease with which foreign workers may be deported and the difficulty of finding employment abroad deters them from reporting violations or discrimination .

 Filipino workers have protested Philippine government targeting of overseas Filipino workers , and a 1982 protest opposed Executive Order No. 857 ( EO @-@ 857 ) implemented by Ferdinand Marcos . According to the order , overseas contract workers were required to remit 50 to 70 percent of their total earnings through authorised government channels only . Migrant @-@ worker groups say that overseas Filipino workers must pay up to <unk> ( $ 3 @,@ 400 ) in government and recruiting @-@ agency fees before they can leave the country . In 2007 , the Philippine government proposed a law requiring workers to submit to a " competency training and assessment program " which would cost them <unk> to <unk> ( US $ 215 to US $ 320 ) – about half their average monthly salary ( typically US $ 450 ) . According to the Philippine Department of Labor and Employment , the policy would help protect domestic overseas workers from abuse by employers . Government agencies receive a total of about <unk> billion ( $ 470 million ) a year from foreign workers in police clearances , National Bureau of Investigation and passport fees , membership in the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration , local health insurance and Philippine Overseas Employment Agency and Home Development Mutual Fund fees . Although charges by Indonesian agencies for dormitory housing , lessons in Cantonese , housework and Chinese cuisine were capped at about HK $ 14 @,@ 000 by the government in 2012 , interest is excluded from the cap . In 2012 , Bloomberg reporters suggested that many agencies contract with workers to convert sums owed before their arrival in Hong Kong into " advances " from moneylenders ( bypassing Hong Kong law ) .

 According to Time , the two @-@ week rule and live @-@ in requirement protect Hong Kong employers of foreign workers . The government argues that the two @-@ week rule is needed to maintain immigration control , preventing job @-@ hopping and imported workers working illegally after their contracts end . " However , it does not preclude the workers concerned from working in Hong Kong again after returning to their place of domicile . " The government implies that in the absence of these rules , workers can easily leave unsatisfactory employers ( creating the disruption of having to find a new employee and incurring an additional fees for a new contract ) . In early 2014 , the government further impeded labour mobility by no longer renewing the visas of workers who change employers more than three times in a year . 
 Hong Kong regards the Erwiana Sulistyaningsih case as isolated , and its labour minister pledged to increase regulation , enforcement and employment @-@ agency inspections . It has conducted several raids on migrant workers accused of not living at their employer 's residence . However , Robert Godden of Amnesty Asia @-@ Pacific said : " The specifics , many of the factors leading to the abuse [ of Erwiana ] , can be applied to thousands of migrant domestic workers : underpayment , restrictions on movement ; you can see that she was heavily indebted by the illegal recruitment fees charged by the agency , and you can see that she didn 't know how to access justice . " In 2014 , the Labour Department prosecuted an employer who allegedly abused Rowena <unk> during her nine @-@ month employment . 
 In March 2016 , an NGO , Justice Centre , reported its findings that deemed one domestic worker in six in Hong Kong to have been forced into labour . It criticised the government for being in denial that Hong Kong is a source , destination and transit area for human trafficking and forced labour , and said Hong Kong lags behind other countries in having a comprehensive set of laws and policies to tackle forced labour or trafficking .

 Yamato ( <unk> ) was the lead ship of the Yamato class of Imperial Japanese Navy World War II battleships .

Neither ship survived the war . 
 Named after the ancient Japanese Yamato Province , Yamato was designed to counter the numerically superior battleship fleet of the United States , Japan 's main rival in the Pacific . She was laid down in 1937 and formally commissioned a week after the Pearl Harbor attack in late 1941 . Throughout 1942 , she served as the flagship of the Japanese Combined Fleet , and in June 1942 Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto directed the fleet from her bridge during the Battle of Midway , a disastrous defeat for Japan . Musashi took over as the Combined Fleet flagship in early 1943 , and Yamato spent the rest of the year , and much of 1944 , moving between the major Japanese naval bases of Truk and Kure in response to American threats . Although present at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944 , she played no part in the battle . 
 The only time Yamato fired her main guns at enemy surface targets was in October 1944 , when she was sent to engage American forces invading the Philippines during the Battle of Leyte Gulf . On the verge of success , the Japanese force turned back , believing they were engaging an entire US carrier fleet rather than the light escort carrier group that was all that stood between the battleship and the vulnerable troop transports . 
 During 1944 , the balance of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan , and by early 1945 , its fleet was much depleted and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands . In a desperate attempt to slow the Allied advance , Yamato was dispatched on a one @-@ way mission to Okinawa in April 1945 , with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed protecting the island . The task force was spotted south of Kyushu by US submarines and aircraft , and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier @-@ based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 During the 1930s the Japanese government adopted an ultranationalist militancy with a view to greatly expand the Japanese Empire . Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934 , renouncing its treaty obligations . After withdrawing from the Washington Naval Treaty , which limited the size and power of capital ships , the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new Yamato class of heavy battleships . Their planners recognized Japan would be unable to compete with the output of U.S. naval shipyards should war break out , so the 70 @,@ 000 ton vessels of the Yamato class were designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy battleships at the same time . 
 The keel of Yamato , the lead ship of the class , was laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal , Hiroshima , on 4 November 1937 , in a dockyard that had to be adapted to accommodate her enormous hull . The dock was deepened by one meter , and gantry cranes capable of lifting up to 350 tonnes were installed . Extreme secrecy was maintained throughout construction , a canopy even being erected over part of the drydock to screen the ship from view . Yamato was launched on 8 August 1940 , with Captain ( later Vice @-@ Admiral ) <unk> <unk> in command . A great effort was made in Japan to ensure that the ships were built in extreme secrecy to prevent American intelligence officials from learning of their existence and specifications . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Yamato 's main battery consisted of nine 46 cm ( 18 @.@ 1 in ) 45 Caliber Type 94 naval guns — the largest caliber of naval artillery ever fitted to a warship , although the shells were not as heavy as those fired by the British 18 @-@ inch naval guns of World War I. Each gun was 21 @.@ 13 metres ( 69 @.@ 3 ft ) long , weighed 147 @.@ 3 tonnes ( 162 @.@ 4 short tons ) , and was capable of firing high @-@ explosive or armor @-@ piercing shells 42 kilometres ( 26 mi ) . Her secondary battery comprised twelve 155 @-@ millimetre ( 6 @.@ 1 in ) guns mounted in four triple turrets ( one forward , one aft , two midships ) , and twelve 127 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) guns in six twin mounts ( three on each side amidships ) . These turrets had been taken off the Mogami @-@ class cruisers when those vessels were converted to a main armament of 20 @.@ 3 @-@ centimetre ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) guns . In addition , Yamato carried twenty @-@ four 25 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) anti @-@ aircraft guns , primarily mounted amidships . When refitted in 1944 and 1945 for naval engagements in the South Pacific , the secondary battery configuration was changed to six 155 mm guns and twenty @-@ four 127 mm guns , and the number of 25 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns was increased to 162 .

 = = = Trials and initial operations = = = 
 During October or November 1941 Yamato underwent sea trials , reaching her maximum possible speed of 27 @.@ 4 knots ( 50 @.@ 7 km / h ; 31 @.@ 5 mph ) . As war loomed , priority was given to accelerating military construction . On 16 December , months ahead of schedule , the battleship was formally commissioned at Kure , in a ceremony more austere than usual , as the Japanese were still intent on concealing the ship 's characteristics . The same day , under Captain ( later Vice @-@ Admiral ) <unk> Takayanagi , she joined fellow battleships Nagato and Mutsu in the 1st Battleship Division . 
 On 12 February 1942 , Yamato became the flagship of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto 's Combined Fleet . A veteran of Japan 's crushing victory over Russia at the Battle of Tsushima in the Russo @-@ Japanese War , the Pearl Harbor victor was planning a decisive engagement with the United States Navy at Midway Island . After participating in war games Yamato departed Hiroshima Bay on 27 May for duty with Yamamoto 's main battleship group . US codebreakers were aware of Yamamoto 's intentions and the Battle of Midway proved disastrous for Japan 's carrier force , with four fleet carriers and 332 aircraft destroyed . Yamamoto exercised overall command from Yamato 's bridge , but his <unk> had widely dispersed his forces to lure the Americans into a trap , and the battleship group was too far away to take part in the engagement . On 5 June , Yamamoto ordered the remaining ships to return to Japan , so Yamato withdrew with the main battleship force to Hashirajima before making her way back to Kure . 
 Yamato left Kure for Truk on 17 August 1942 . After 11 days at sea , she was sighted by the American submarine USS Flying Fish , which fired four torpedoes ( all of which missed ) ; Yamato arrived safely at Truk later that day . She remained here throughout the Guadalcanal Campaign because of a lack of 460 mm ammunition suitable for shore bombardment , uncharted seas around Guadalcanal , and her high fuel consumption . Before the year 's end , Captain ( later Rear Admiral ) Chiaki Matsuda was assigned to command Yamato . 
 On 11 February 1943 , Yamato was replaced by her sister ship Musashi as flagship of the Combined Fleet . Dubbed " Hotel Yamato " by the Japanese cruiser and destroyer crews stationed in the South Pacific , the battleship spent only a single day away from Truk between her arrival in August 1942 and her departure on 8 May 1943 . On that day , she set sail for Yokosuka and from there for Kure , arriving on 14 May . She spent nine days in dry dock for inspection and general repairs , and after sailing to Japan 's western Inland Sea she was again dry @-@ docked in late July for significant refitting and upgrades . On 16 August , Yamato began her return to Truk , where she joined a large task force formed in response to American raids on the Tarawa and Makin atolls . She sortied in late September with Nagato , three carriers , and smaller warships to intercept US Task Force 15 , and again a month later with six battleships , three carriers , and eleven cruisers . Intelligence had reported that the United States Naval Base at Pearl Harbor was nearly empty of ships , which the Japanese interpreted to mean that an American naval force would strike at Wake Island . But there were no radar contacts for six days , and the fleet returned to Truk , arriving on 26 October . 
 Yamato escorted Transport Operation BO @-@ 1 from Truk to Yokosuka during 12 – 17 December . Subsequently , because of their extensive storage capacity and thick armor protection , Yamato and Musashi were pressed into service as transport vessels . On 25 December , while ferrying troops and equipment — which were wanted as reinforcements for the garrisons at Kavieng and the Admiralty Islands — from Yokosuka to Truk , Yamato and her task group were intercepted by the American submarine Skate about 180 miles ( 290 km ) out at sea . Skate fired a spread of four torpedoes at Yamato ; one struck the battleship 's starboard side toward the stern . A hole 5 metres ( 16 ft ) below the top of her anti @-@ torpedo bulge and measuring some 25 metres ( 82 ft ) across was ripped open in the hull , and a joint between the upper and lower armored belts failed , causing the rear turret 's upper magazine to flood . Yamato took on about 3 @,@ 000 tons of water , but reached Truk later that day . The repair ship Akashi effected temporary repairs on the battleship , and Yamato departed on 10 January for Kure . 
 On 16 January 1944 , Yamato arrived at Kure for repairs of the torpedo damage and was dry @-@ docked until 3 February . During this time , armor plate sloped at 45 ° was fitted in the area of damage to her hull . It had been proposed that 5 @,@ 000 long tons ( 5 @,@ 100 t ) of steel be used to bolster the ship 's defense against flooding from torpedo hits outside the armored citadel , but this was rejected out of hand because the additional weight would have increased Yamato 's displacement and draft by too much . While Yamato was dry @-@ docked , Captain <unk> Morishita — former captain of the battleship Haruna — assumed command . On 25 February , Yamato and Musashi were reassigned from the 1st Battleship Division to the Second Fleet . 
 Yamato was again dry @-@ docked at Kure for further upgrades to all her radar and anti @-@ aircraft systems from 25 February to 18 March 1944 . Each of the two beam @-@ mounted 6 @.@ 1 inch ( 155 @-@ mm ) triple turrets was removed and replaced by three pairs of 5 @-@ inch ( 127 @-@ mm ) AA guns in double mounts . In addition , 8 triple and 26 single 25mm AA mounts were added at this time , increasing the total number of 127 mm and 25 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns to 24 and 162 , respectively . Shelters were also added on the upper deck for the increased AA crews . A Type 13 air search and Type 22 , Mod 4 , surface search / gunnery control radar were installed and the main mast was altered . Her radar suite was also upgraded to include infrared identification systems and aircraft search and gunnery control radars . She left the dry dock on 18 March and went through several trials beginning on 11 April . Yamato left Kure on 21 April and embarked soldiers and materiel the following day at Okinoshima for a mission to Manila , reaching the Philippines on 28 April . She then moved on to Malaya to join Vice @-@ Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa 's Mobile Fleet at Lingga ; this force arrived at Tawi Tawi on 14 May . 
 = = = Battle of the Philippine Sea = = = 
 In early June , Yamato and Musashi were again requisitioned as troop transports , this time to reinforce the garrison and naval defenses of the island of Biak as part of Operation Kon . The mission was cancelled when word reached Ozawa 's headquarters of American carrier attacks on the Mariana Islands . Instead , the Imperial Japanese Navy reorganized , concentrating the majority of its remaining fighting strength in the hope of achieving a decisive success against the Americans . By this time though , the entire Japanese navy was inferior in numbers and experience to the U.S. Pacific Fleet . From 19 to 23 June 1944 , Yamato escorted forces of Ozawa 's Mobile Fleet during the Battle of the Philippine Sea , dubbed by American pilots " The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot " . The Japanese lost three aircraft carriers and 426 aircraft ; Yamato 's only significant contribution was mistakenly opening fire on returning Japanese aircraft . 
 Following the battle , Yamato withdrew with the Mobile Fleet to the Hashirajima staging area near Kure to refuel and rearm . With Musashi she left the fleet on 24 June for the short journey to Kure , where she received five more triple 25 mm anti @-@ aircraft mounts . The opportunity was taken to put in place " emergency buoyancy keeping procedures . " These resulted in the removal of almost every flammable item from the battleship , including linoleum , bedding , and mattresses . In place of the latter , men slept on planks which could be used to repair damage . Flammable paints received a new silicon based overcoat , and additional portable pumps and fire fighting apparatus were installed . Leaving Japan on 8 July , Yamato — accompanied by the battleships Musashi , Kongō , Nagato , and eleven cruisers and destroyers — sailed south . Yamato and Musashi headed for the Lingga Islands , arriving on 16 – 17 July . By this stage of the war , Japan 's tanker fleet had been much reduced by marauding American submarines , so major fleet units were stationed in the East Indies to be near the source of their fuel supply . The battleships remained at the islands for the next three months . 
 = = = Battle of Leyte Gulf = = = 
 Between 22 and 25 October 1944 , as part of Admiral Takeo Kurita 's Center Force ( also known as Force A or First Striking Force ) , Yamato took part in one of the largest naval engagements in history — the Battle of Leyte Gulf . In response to the American invasion of the Philippines , Operation Shō @-@ Gō called for a number of Japanese groups to converge on the island of Leyte , where American troops were landing . On 18 October , Yamato was given a coating of black camouflage in preparation for her nighttime transit of the San Bernardino Strait ; the main ingredient was soot taken from her smokestack . While en route to Leyte , the force was attacked in Palawan Passage on 23 October by the submarines USS Darter and Dace , which sank two Takao @-@ class heavy cruisers including Kurita 's flagship , Atago , and damaged a third . Kurita survived the loss of Atago and transferred his flag to Yamato . 
 = = = = Battle of the Sibuyan Sea = = = = 
 The following day the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea hurt the Center Force badly with the loss of three more heavy cruisers , eliminating a substantial part of the fleet 's anti @-@ aircraft defence . During the course of the day , American carrier aircraft sortied a total of 259 times . Aircraft from the USS Essex struck Yamato with two armor @-@ piercing bombs and scored one near miss ; Yamato suffered moderate damage and took on about 3 @,@ 370 tonnes ( 3 @,@ 320 long tons ) of water , but remained battleworthy . However , her sister ship Musashi became the focus of the American attacks and eventually sank after being hit with 17 bombs and 19 torpedoes . 
 = = = = Battle off Samar = = = = 
 Unknown to the Japanese admiral , the main American defensive force with Admiral William Halsey , Jr. departed Leyte on the evening of 24 October . Convinced that Kurita 's Center Force had been turned back , Halsey took his powerful 3rd Fleet in pursuit of the Japanese Northern Force , a decoy group composed of one fleet aircraft carrier ( Zuikaku ) , three light carriers , two Ise @-@ class hybrid battleship @-@ carriers , and their escorts . The deception was a success , drawing away five fleet carriers and five light carriers with more than 600 aircraft among them , six fast battleships , eight cruisers , and over 40 destroyers . During the hours of darkness , Kurita 's force navigated the San Bernardino Strait and shortly after dawn , in the Battle off Samar , attacked an American formation that had remained in the area to provide close support for the invading troops . Known as " Taffy 3 " , this small group comprised six escort carriers , three destroyers , and four destroyer escorts . In the initial stages of this battle , Yamato engaged enemy surface targets for the only time in her career , hitting several American ships . After Yamato confirmed primary battery hits on the escort carrier USS Gambier Bay , a spread of torpedoes heading for Yamato was spotted ; the battleship was forced to steer away from the fighting to avoid them and was unable to rejoin the battle . Although armed only with torpedoes and 5 inch guns and under attack by large caliber cannons , the light American surface combatants , supported by FM @-@ 2 Wildcats and TBM Avengers from Taffy 3 's escort carriers , attacked so ferociously that Kurita believed his ships were engaging a full American task force of fleet carriers . A mistaken report that he was facing six fleet carriers , three cruisers , and two destroyers led Kurita to order his task force to turn and disengage . Yamato emerged from the battle without serious damage ; only three near misses from bombs and seventeen casualties from strafing were suffered during the battle itself , while carrier strikes during the retreat caused light damage to the ship and injured or killed 21 crewmen . Three more heavy cruisers and one light cruiser were subsequently lost . The Centre Force sank one American escort carrier ( CVE ) , two destroyers , and a destroyer escort . A second CVE was lost by kamikaze attack after the surface engagement . 
 Following the engagement , Yamato and the remnants of Kurita 's force returned to Brunei . On 15 November 1944 , the 1st Battleship Division was disbanded and Yamato became the flagship of the Second Fleet . On 21 November , while transiting the East China Sea in a withdrawal to Kure Naval Base , Yamato 's battle group was attacked by the submarine USS Sealion . The battleship Kongō and destroyer Urakaze were lost . Yamato was immediately drydocked for repairs and anti @-@ aircraft upgrades on reaching Kure , where several of the battleship 's older anti @-@ aircraft guns were replaced . On 25 November , Captain <unk> Kōsaku was named Yamato 's commander . 
 = = = Operation Ten @-@ Go = = = 
 On 1 January 1945 , Yamato , Haruna and Nagato were transferred to the newly reactivated 1st Battleship Division . Yamato left drydock two days later for Japan 's Inland Sea . This reassignment was brief ; the 1st Battleship Division was deactivated once again on 10 February and Yamato was allotted to the 1st Carrier Division . On 19 March , American carrier aircraft from Enterprise , Yorktown and Intrepid raided Kure . Although 16 warships were hit , Yamato sustained only minor damage from a number of near misses and from one bomb that struck her bridge . The intervention of a squadron of Kawanishi <unk> " Shiden " fighters ( named " George " by the Allies ) flown by veteran Japanese fighter instructors prevented the raid from doing too much damage to the base and assembled ships , while Yamato 's ability to maneuver — albeit slowly — in the <unk> Channel benefited her . 
 As the final step before their planned invasion of the Japanese mainland , Allied forces invaded Okinawa on 1 April . The Imperial Japanese Navy 's response was to organise a mission codenamed Operation Ten @-@ Go that would see the commitment of much of Japan 's remaining surface strength . Yamato and nine escorts ( the cruiser Yahagi and eight destroyers ) would sail to Okinawa and , in concert with kamikaze and Okinawa @-@ based army units , attack the Allied forces assembled on and around Okinawa . Yamato would then be beached to act as an unsinkable gun emplacement and continue to fight until destroyed . In preparation for the mission , Yamato had taken on a full stock of ammunition on 29 March . According to the Japanese plan , the ships were supposed to take aboard only enough fuel for a one way voyage to Okinawa , but additional fuel amounting to 60 percent of capacity was issued on the authority of local base commanders . Designated the " Surface Special Attack Force " , the ships left Tokuyama at 15 : 20 on 6 April . 
 Unfortunately for the Japanese , the Allies had intercepted and decoded their radio transmissions , learning the particulars of Operation Ten @-@ Go . Further confirmation of Japanese intentions came around 20 : 00 when the Surface Special Attack Force , navigating the Bungo Strait , was spotted by the American submarines <unk> and <unk> . Both reported Yamato 's position to the main American carrier strike force , but neither could attack because of the speed of the Japanese ships — 22 knots ( 25 mph ; 41 km / h ) — and their extreme zigzagging . 
 The Allied forces around Okinawa began to brace for an assault . Admiral Raymond Spruance ordered six battleships already engaged in shore bombardment in the sector to prepare for surface action against Yamato . These orders were countermanded in favor of strikes from Admiral Marc Mitscher 's aircraft carriers , but as a contingency the battleships together with seven cruisers and twenty one destroyers were sent to interdict the Japanese force before it could reach the vulnerable transports and landing craft . 
 Yamato 's crew were at general quarters and ready for anti @-@ aircraft action by dawn on 7 April . The first Allied aircraft made contact with the Surface Special Attack Force at 08 : 23 ; two flying boats arrived soon thereafter , and for the next five hours , Yamato fired Common Type 3 or Beehive ( 3 Shiki tsûjôdan ) shells at the Allied seaplanes , but could not prevent them from shadowing the force . Yamato obtained her first radar contact with aircraft at 10 : 00 ; an hour later , American F6F Hellcat fighters appeared overhead to deal with any Japanese aircraft that might appear . None did . 
 At about 12 : 30 , 280 bomber and torpedo bomber aircraft arrived over the Japanese force . Asashimo , which had earlier fallen out of formation due to engine trouble , was caught and sunk by a detachment of aircraft from San Jacinto . The Surface Special Attack Force increased speed to 24 knots ( 28 mph ; 44 km / h ) , and following standard Japanese anti @-@ aircraft defensive measures , the destroyers began circling Yamato . The first aircraft swooped in to attack at 12 : 37 . Yahagi turned and raced away at 35 knots ( 40 mph ; 65 km / h ) in an attempt to draw off some of the attackers ; it drew off only an insignificant number . Yamato was not hit for four minutes , but at 12 : 41 two bombs obliterated two of her triple 25 mm anti @-@ aircraft mounts and blew a hole in the deck . A third bomb then destroyed her radar room and the starboard aft 127 mm mount . At 12 : 46 , another two bombs struck the battleship 's port side , one slightly ahead of the aft 155 mm centreline turret and the other right on top of the gun . These caused a great deal of damage to the turret and its magazines ; only one man survived . At 12 : 45 a single torpedo struck Yamato far forward on her port side , sending extreme shocks throughout the ship . Because many of the ship 's survivors were later killed by strafing or were trapped when Yamato sank , the details are uncertain , but authors Garzke and Dulin record that little damage was caused . Shortly afterward , up to three more torpedoes struck Yamato . Two impacts , on the port side near the engine room and on one of the boiler rooms , are confirmed ; the third is disputed but is regarded by Garzke and Dulin as probable because it would explain the reported flooding in Yamato 's auxiliary steering room . The attack ended around 12 : 47 , leaving the battleship listing 5 – 6 ° to port ; counterflooding — deliberately flooding compartments on the other side of the ship — reduced the list to 1 ° . One boiler room had been disabled , slightly reducing Yamato 's top speed , and strafing had incapacitated many of the gun crews who manned Yamato 's unprotected 25 mm anti @-@ aircraft weapons , sharply curtailing their effectiveness . 
 The second attack started just before 13 : 00 . In a coordinated strike , dive bombers flew high overhead to begin their runs while torpedo bombers approached from all directions at just above sea level . Overwhelmed by the number of targets , the battleship 's anti @-@ aircraft guns were less than effective , and the Japanese tried desperate measures to break up the attack . Yamato 's main guns were loaded with Beehive shells fused to explode one second after firing — a mere 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) from the ship — but this had little effect . Three or four torpedoes struck the battleship on the port side , and one to starboard . Three hits , close together on the port side , are confirmed : one struck a fireroom that had been hit earlier , one impacted a different fireroom , and the third hit the hull adjacent to a previously damaged outboard engine room , increasing the water that had already been flowing into that space and possibly causing flooding in nearby locations . The fourth , unconfirmed , hit may have struck aft of the third ; Garzke and Dulin believe this would explain the rapid flooding that reportedly occurred in that location . This attack left Yamato in a perilous position , listing 15 – 18 ° to port . Counterflooding all of the remaining starboard void spaces lessened this to 10 ° , but further correction would have required either repairs or flooding the starboard engine and fire rooms . Although the battleship was in no danger of sinking at this point , the list meant that the main battery was unable to fire and her maximum speed was limited to 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 The third and most damaging attack developed at about 13 : 40 . At least four bombs hit the ship 's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25 mm anti @-@ aircraft gun crews . Many near misses drove in her outer plating , partially compromising her defense against torpedoes . Most serious were four more torpedo impacts . Three exploded on the port side , increasing water intake into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fireroom and the steering gear room . With the auxiliary steering room already underwater , the ship lost all maneuverability and became stuck in a starboard turn . The fourth torpedo most likely hit the starboard outer engine room which , along with three other rooms on the starboard side , was in the process of being <unk> to reduce the port list . The torpedo strike greatly increased the rate of water intake , trapping many crewmen before they could escape . 
 At 14 : 02 , the order was belatedly given to abandon ship . By this time , Yamato 's speed had dropped to 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) and her list was steadily increasing . Fires were raging out of control in some sections of the ship and alarms had begun to sound on the bridge warning of critical temperatures in the forward main battery magazines . Normal practice would have been to flood the magazines , preventing any explosion , but the pumping stations that should have performed this task had been rendered unusable by previous flooding . 
 At 14 : 05 , Yahagi sank , the victim of twelve bombs and seven torpedoes . At the same time , a final flight of torpedo bombers attacked Yamato from her starboard side . Her list was now such that the torpedoes — set to a depth of 6 @.@ 1 m ( 20 ft ) — struck the bottom of her hull . The battleship continued her inexorable roll to port . By 14 : 20 , the power went out and her remaining 25 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns began to drop into the sea . Three minutes later , Yamato capsized . Her main 46 cm turrets fell off , and as she rolled suction was created that drew swimming crewmen back toward the ship . When the roll reached approximately 120 ° , one of the two bow magazines detonated in a tremendous explosion . The resulting mushroom cloud — over 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) high — was seen 160 kilometres ( 99 mi ) away on Kyūshū . Yamato sank rapidly , losing an estimated 3 @,@ 055 of her 3 @,@ 332 crew , including fleet commander Vice @-@ Admiral Seiichi Itō . The few survivors were recovered by the four surviving destroyers , which withdrew to Japan . 
 From the first attack at 12 : 37 to the explosion at 14 : 23 , Yamato was hit by at least eleven torpedoes and six bombs . There may have been two more torpedo and bomb hits , but this is not confirmed . 
 = = Wreck discovery = = 
 Because of the often confused circumstances and incomplete information regarding their sinkings , few wrecks of Japanese capital ships have been discovered and identified . Drawing on US wartime records , an expedition to the South China Sea in 1982 produced some results , but the wreckage discovered could not be clearly identified . A second expedition returned to the site two years later , and the team 's photographic and video records were later confirmed by one of the battleship 's designers , Shigeru Makino to show the Yamato 's last resting place . The wreck lies 290 kilometres ( 180 mi ) southwest of Kyushu under 340 metres ( 1 @,@ 120 ft ) of water in two main pieces ; a bow section comprising the front two thirds of the ship , and a separate stern section . 
 On 16 July 2015 , a group of Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers began meetings to study the feasibility of raising the ship from the ocean floor and recovering the remains of crewmembers entombed in the wreckage . The group said that it plans to request government funds to research the technical feasibility of recovering the ship . 
 = = Cultural significance = = 
 From the time of their construction , Yamato and her sister Musashi carried significant weight in Japanese culture . The battleships represented the epitome of Imperial Japanese naval engineering , and because of their size , speed , and power , visibly embodied Japan 's determination and readiness to defend its interests against the Western Powers and the United States in particular . Shigeru Fukudome , chief of the Operations Section of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff , described the ships as " symbols of naval power that provided to officers and men alike a profound sense of confidence in their navy . " Yamato 's symbolic might was such that some Japanese citizens held the belief that their country could never fall as long as the ship was able to fight . 
 Decades after the war , Yamato was memorialised in various forms by the Japanese . Historically , the word " Yamato " was used as a poetic name for Japan ; thus , her name became a metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire . In April 1968 , a memorial tower was erected on Cape <unk> in Japan 's Kagoshima Prefecture to commemorate the lives lost in Operation Ten @-@ Go . In October 1974 , <unk> Matsumoto created a new television series , Space Battleship Yamato , about rebuilding the battleship as a starship and its interstellar quest to save Earth . The series was a huge success , spawning five feature films and two more TV series ; as post @-@ war Japanese tried to redefine the purpose of their lives , Yamato became a symbol of heroism and of their desire to regain a sense of masculinity after their country 's defeat in the war . Brought to the United States as Star Blazers , the animated series proved popular and established a foundation for anime in the North American entertainment market . The motif in Space Battleship Yamato was repeated in Silent Service , a popular manga and anime that explores issues of nuclear weapons and the Japan @-@ US relationship . The crew of the main plot device , a nuclear @-@ powered super submarine , mutinied and renamed their vessel Yamato , in allusion to the World War II battleship and the ideals she symbolises . 
 In 2005 , the Yamato Museum was opened near the site of the former Kure shipyards . Although intended to educate on the maritime history of post Meiji @-@ era Japan , the museum gives special attention to its namesake ; the battleship is a common theme among several of its exhibits , which includes a section dedicated to Matsumoto 's animated series . The centrepiece of the museum , occupying a large section of the first floor , is a 26 @.@ 3 @-@ metre long model of Yamato ( 1 : 10 scale ) . 
 Later that year , Toei released a 143 @-@ minute movie , Yamato , based on a book by Jun Henmi , to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II ; Tamiya released special editions of scale models of the battleship in conjunction with the film 's release . Based on a book of the same name , the film is a tale about the sailors aboard the doomed battleship and the concepts of honour and duty . The film was shown on more than 290 screens across the country and was a commercial success , taking in a record 5 @.@ 11 billion yen at the domestic box office .

 Ciara originally planned to release Fantasy Ride in the form of three discs , each representing a particular sound . The third disc " Kingdom of Dance " , which featured dance @-@ oriented music , was set to include " Work " . In an August 2008 interview for Billboard , Ciara regarded the song as energetic and great to listen to while exercising : " you 're going to sweat up a storm in the club . " " Work " and " High Price " were at one point in contention to serve as the album 's lead single , but " Go Girl " was selected instead . " Work " was released worldwide on July 24 , 2009 , as the fifth and final single of Fantasy Ride . On August 21 , 2009 , B @-@ side track " Fit of Love " appeared on the German CD single release of " Work " . The single was digitally released in the United States on December 8 , 2009 . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Work " is an electropop and dance song with elements of house in its production . The fast @-@ paced song features dance and hip hop beats , and uses hand claps and synth bleeps as its backdrop . Andrew Rennie of Canadian magazine Now described the instrumentation as " kick drum @-@ heavy " , and Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it a " frenetic club track " . Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that Ciara " nimbly navigates synth bleats and burps and a shake @-@ and @-@ shimmy beat " . The song opens with lines by Elliott as she raps " When the song come on in the club , turn it up , turn it up , turn it up . " Ciara then opens the first verse , singing " The dance train is coming back again . Extravaganza , you should run and tell a friend . " The hook consists of the repeated remarks " Work ! Work ! " Digital Spy 's David Balls regarded the line " You better shake that thang [ sic ] like a donkey ! " as " thought @-@ provoking " .

 Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe named " Work " the album 's best track and praised Elliott 's addition . Rodman wrote that Ciara " takes her own advice to ' put some snap into it ' . " About.com writer Bill Lamb named it one of the album 's best , and wrote that it " lands somewhere between Ciara 's contemporary classic ' 1 , 2 Step ' and Missy Elliott 's own ' Lose Control ' . " Andrew Rennie of Now considered it the album 's strongest track and noted Ciara and Elliott 's " trademark chemistry " . IGN 's Finn White wrote that the song " will make all the bad girls sweat on the dance floor " . In his review of Fantasy Ride , <unk> Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote that " Love Sex Magic " is a " dance @-@ floor corker " , and noted that " Work " is " similarly club @-@ ready " , referring both songs to as " ultra @-@ catchy " . Regarding " Work " , Tarradell wrote , " The rapid @-@ fire ' work , work , work ' refrain will bond to your head as if with Krazy Glue . " Writing for Metro Weekly , Doug Rule called the song an " instant classic " and referred it to as a " sequel of sorts to Elliott 's marvelous 2002 hit ' Work It ' . " A writer from Rap @-@ Up named the song one of the album 's top tracks . 
 David Balls of Digital Spy rated " Work " three stars out of five , writing that it " bears all the ingredients of a smash , but lacks the killer blow to leave you gasping for air . " Balls also noted that Ciara tends to rely on guest artists to guarantee a hit . The Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra called the song a " blast of energy " , but observed that it is " too reminiscent of past Ciara / Elliott hits " . Guerra said that " A little variation would have made for a more dynamic tune . " Andy Kellman of Allmusic was more critical and called the song an " over @-@ stuffed dancefloor mess that does not benefit from Missy Elliott 's hoarse <unk> " . Jordan Sargent of PopMatters considered the song a letdown due to Ciara 's " lifeless " vocal delivery . Dan Gennoe of Yahoo ! UK & Ireland referred to the song as " an underwhelming twitch which Missy surely wouldn 't have had anywhere near one of her own albums . "

 The music video for " Work " was directed by Melina Matsoukas , who previously directed the clip for Ciara 's single " Go Girl " ( 2008 ) . A preview premiered in early June 2009 and promotional photos were later released . The full video premiered in the United Kingdom on June 23 , 2009 at 7 pm on 4Music , and was later broadcast on Channel 4 , at midnight . The following day , the video was added to Ciara 's official profile on Bebo . 
 The video commences with shots of a construction site , where Ciara arrives in a large construction vehicle . Elliott raps her opening verse from the top of a pile of large tires while Ciara makes her debut in a gray jumpsuit with square aviator sunglasses . She soon appears in a slender black leotard and walks seductively along a construction walkway . Ciara and her dancers move to a dune in front of the site , where they perform a group choreography . The dancers wear white tops , torn blue jeans , construction belts and goggles . The second verse features an intense dance and switches halfway through to Ciara in a turquoise PVC dress and black strap stilettos , dancing in front of a pile of tires . She and her dancers return to the dune and dance to Elliott 's words . The video ends in the sand dune as Ciara and her dancers slowly drop to the ground and then get back up .

 Chitty @-@ Chitty @-@ Bang @-@ Bang : The Magical Car is a children 's novel written by Ian Fleming for his son Caspar , with illustrations by John Burningham . It was initially published in three volumes , the first of which was released on 22 October 1964 by Jonathan Cape in London . 
 Fleming , better known as the creator of James Bond , took his inspiration for the subject from a series of aero @-@ engined racing cars called " Chitty Bang Bang " , built by Count Louis Zborowski in the early 1920s at Higham Park . Fleming had known Higham Park as a guest of its later owner , Walter Wigham , chairman of Robert Fleming & Co . 
 Chitty @-@ Chitty @-@ Bang @-@ Bang was loosely adapted as a 1968 film of the same name with a screenplay by Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes ; a subsequent novelisation was also published . The film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli , co @-@ producer of the James Bond film series . The story was also adapted as a stage musical under the same name . In April 2011 a BBC Radio 4 Extra adaptation was broadcast with Imogen Stubbs as the voice of Chitty . Three sequels to Fleming 's book have been published , all written by Frank Cottrell Boyce . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Commander Caractacus Pott is an inventor who buys and renovates an old car after gaining money from inventing and selling whistle @-@ like sweets to Lord <unk> , the wealthy owner of a local confectionery factory . The car , a " Paragon Panther " , was the sole production of the Paragon motor @-@ car company before it went bankrupt . It is a four @-@ seat touring car with an enormous bonnet . After the restoration is complete , the car is named for the noises made by its starter motor and the characteristic two loud backfires it makes when it starts . 
 At first Chitty @-@ Chitty @-@ Bang @-@ Bang is just a big and powerful car , but as the book progresses the car surprises the family by beginning to exhibit independent actions . This first happens while the family is caught in a traffic jam on their way to the beach for a picnic . The car suddenly instructs Commander Pott to pull a switch which causes Chitty @-@ Chitty @-@ Bang @-@ Bang to sprout wings and take flight over the stopped cars on the road . Commander Pott flies them to Goodwin Sands in the English Channel where the family picnics , swims , and sleeps . While the family naps , the tide comes in threatening to drown them . Chitty @-@ Chitty @-@ Bang @-@ Bang wakes them just in time with a hiss of steam . At the car 's direction , Commander Pott pulls another switch which causes it to transform into a hovercraft @-@ like vehicle . They make for the French coast and land on a beach near Calais . They explore along the beach and find a cave <unk> with some devices intended to scare off intruders . At the back of the cave is a store of armaments and explosives . The family detonates the cache of explosives and flees the cave . 
 The gangsters / gun @-@ runners who own the ammunition dump arrive and block the road in front of Chitty @-@ Chitty @-@ Bang @-@ Bang . The gangsters threaten the family , but Commander Pott throws the switch which transforms the car into an aeroplane and they take off , leaving the gangsters in helpless fury . The Potts stay overnight in a hotel in Calais . While the family sleeps , the gangsters break into the children 's room and kidnap them and drive off towards Paris . Chitty tracks the gangsters ' route , wakes Commander and Mrs. Pott , and they drive off in pursuit . 
 The gangsters are planning to rob a famous chocolate shop in Paris using the children as decoys . The Pott children overhear this and manage to warn the shop owner , Monsieur Bon @-@ Bon . Chitty arrives in time to prevent the gangsters from fleeing . The police arrive and the gangsters are taken away . As a reward Monsieur Bon @-@ Bon 's wife shares the secret recipe of her world famous fudge with the Potts and the two families become good friends .

 By 1961 Fleming had published nine James Bond books . The most recent of these was Thunderball , a novel Fleming initially published under his own name , but which was the subject of a legal action by its co @-@ authors , Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham . In March 1961 , McClory read an advance copy of the book and he and Whittingham immediately petitioned the High Court in London for an injunction to stop publication . The case was heard on 24 March 1961 and allowed the book to be published , although the door was left open for McClory to pursue further action at a later date . He did so and , on 19 November 1963 , the case of McClory v Fleming was heard at the Chancery Division of the High Court . The proceedings lasted three weeks , during which time Fleming was unwell , suffering a heart attack as the case progressed . 
 Two weeks after the case , during the weekly Tuesday staff conference at his employers , The Sunday Times , Fleming suffered a serious , second heart attack that necessitated convalescence , which he undertook at the Dudley Hotel in Hove . While there , one of Fleming 's friends , Duff Dunbar , gave him a copy of Beatrix Potter 's The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin to read and suggested that he took the time to write up the bedtime story that Fleming used to tell his son Caspar each evening . Fleming attacked the project with gusto and wrote to his publisher , Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape , joking that " There is not a moment , even on the edge of the tomb , when I am not slaving for you " . 
 As he wrote the novel , Fleming used aspects of his life to flesh out the details , much as he did with many of his Bond stories . Thus , in the novel , one of the children was called Jemima , after the daughter of his previous employer , Hugo Pitman ; the advice Pott gave to his children also echoed that of Fleming : " Never say ' no ' to adventures . Always say ' yes ' , otherwise you 'll lead a very dull life . " 
 Chitty @-@ Chitty @-@ Bang @-@ Bang the car was based on a composite of two cars : Fleming 's own Standard Tourer , which he had driven in Switzerland in the late 1920s , and Chitty Bang Bang , a chain @-@ driven customised Mercedes with a 23 @-@ litre 6 @-@ cylinder Maybach aero @-@ engine . Fleming had seen the car 's owner , Count Louis Zborowski race at the Brooklands race track . The origin of the name “ Chitty Bang Bang ” is disputed , but may also have been inspired by early aeronautical engineer Letitia Chitty . Like Zborowski , Fleming names his car because of the noise it made — and the noise a car made was important to Fleming . 
 In May 1961 Fleming sent his publisher the manuscripts for the first two volumes of Chitty @-@ Chitty @-@ Bang @-@ Bang . To illustrate the book , Fleming suggested the Daily Mail cartoonist Trog — the pseudonym of Wally Fawkes — as he admired the artist 's work . While undertaking the preliminary drawings for the book , Trog tried to make the fudge recipe included in the book and found it was not particularly good : the editors at Jonathan Cape spent a day making up batches from different recipes to find a better one to use . Although Fawkes completed preliminary drawings for the project , the Daily Mail refused to allow him to complete the work as many of Fleming 's works were serialised in its rival , the Daily Express . Other early illustrative sketches were produced by artist Haro Hodson and motor engineer Amherst Villiers . After Trog was forced to withdraw from the project , Cape commissioned John Burningham , who had recently won the 1963 Kate Greenaway Medal for his book <unk> : The Adventures of a Goose with No Feathers . 
 Fleming did not live to see Chitty @-@ Chitty @-@ Bang @-@ Bang published : he suffered a further heart attack on 11 August 1964 and died in the early morning of the following day — his son Caspar 's twelfth birthday — in Canterbury , Kent . The book was published two months after his death .

 Alexander Muir , in the Daily Mirror , considered that the first two volumes of Chitty @-@ Chitty @-@ Bang @-@ Bang , " would make wonderful Christmas presents for everybody 's young ones " , declaring that they were " thrilling cliff @-@ hanger adventures " .

The style is avuncular , the writing down too evident . " 
 The reviewer for The Times noted that " junior Bonds @-@ men ... can cut their teeth on " the novel . Concerning volume one of the book , The Sunday Times reviewer Oscar <unk> wrote that " Fleming was right in judging the children 's market ripe for the ... cliff hanger " and praised his " avuncular and knowledgeable storytelling " , which was matched by Burningham 's illustrations .

 = Lundy = 
 Lundy is the largest island in the Bristol Channel . It lies 12 miles ( 19 km ) off the coast of Devon , England , about a third of the distance across the channel from Devon , England to South Wales . Lundy gives its name to a British sea area and is one of the islands of England . Lundy has been designated by Natural England as national character area 159 , one of England 's natural regions . 
 In 2007 , Lundy had a resident population of 28 people , including volunteers . These include a warden , ranger , island manager and farmer , as well as bar and house @-@ keeping staff . Most live in and around the village at the south of the island . Most visitors are day @-@ trippers , although there are 23 holiday properties and a camp site for staying visitors , mostly also around the south of the island . 
 In a 2005 opinion poll of Radio Times readers , Lundy was named as Britain 's tenth greatest natural wonder . The entire island has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and it was England 's first statutory Marine Nature reserve , and the first Marine Conservation Zone , because of its unique flora and fauna . It is managed by the Landmark Trust on behalf of the National Trust . 
 = = History = = 
 The name Lundy is believed to come from the old Norse word for " puffin island " ( <unk> ) , <unk> being the Old Norse word for a puffin and ey , an island , although an alternative explanation has been suggested with Lund referring to a copse , or wooded area . 
 Lundy has evidence of visitation or occupation from the Neolithic period onward , with Mesolithic flintwork , Bronze Age burial mounds , four inscribed gravestones from the early medieval period , and an early medieval monastery ( possibly dedicated to St Elen or St Helen ) . 
 = = = Beacon Hill Cemetery = = = 
 Beacon Hill Cemetery was excavated by Charles Thomas in 1969 . The cemetery contains four inscribed stones , dated to the 5th or 6th century AD . The site was originally enclosed by a curvilinear bank and ditch , which is still visible in the south west corner . However , the other walls were moved when the Old Light was constructed in 1819 . Celtic Christian enclosures of this type were common in Western Britain and are known as <unk> in Welsh and <unk> in Cornish . There are surviving examples in <unk> , in Cornwall ; <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in Wales ; and Stowford , <unk> , Lydford and Instow , in Devon . 
 Thomas proposed a five @-@ stage sequence of site usage : ( 1 ) An area of round huts and fields . These huts may have fallen into disuse before the construction of the cemetery . ( 2 ) The construction of the focal grave , an 11 by 8 ft ( 3 @.@ 4 by 2 @.@ 4 m ) rectangular stone enclosure containing a single cist grave . The interior of the enclosure was filled with small granite pieces . Two more cist graves located to the west of the enclosure may also date from this time . ( 3 ) Perhaps 100 years later , the focal grave was opened and the infill removed . The body may have been moved to a church at this time . ( 4 ) & ( 5 ) Two further stages of cist grave construction around the focal grave . 
 23 cist graves were found during this excavation . Considering that the excavation only uncovered a small area of the cemetery , there may be as many as 100 graves .

 Lundy was granted to the Knights Templar by Henry II in 1160 . The Templars were a major international maritime force at this time , with interests in North Devon , and almost certainly an important port at Bideford or on the River Taw in Barnstaple . This was probably because of the increasing threat posed by the Norse sea raiders ; however , it is unclear whether they ever took possession of the island . Ownership was disputed by the Marisco family who may have already been on the island during King Stephen 's reign . The <unk> were fined , and the island was cut off from necessary supplies . Evidence of the Templars ' weak hold on the island came when King John , on his accession in 1199 , confirmed the earlier grant . 
 = = = Marisco family = = = 
 In 1235 William de Marisco was implicated in the murder of Henry Clement , a messenger of Henry III . Three years later , an attempt was made to kill Henry III by a man who later confessed to being an agent of the Marisco family . William de Marisco fled to Lundy where he lived as a virtual king . He built a stronghold in the area now known as Bulls ' Paradise with 9 feet ( 3 m ) thick walls . In 1242 , Henry III sent troops to the island . They scaled the island 's cliff and captured William de Marisco and 16 of his " subjects " . Henry III built the castle ( sometimes referred to as the Marisco Castle ) in an attempt to establish the rule of law on the island and its surrounding waters . At some point in the 13th century the monks of the Cistercian order at Cleeve Abbey held the rectory of the island . 
 = = = Piracy = = = 
 Over the next few centuries , the island was hard to govern . Trouble followed as both English and foreign pirates and privateers – including other members of the Marisco family – took control of the island for short periods . Ships were forced to navigate close to Lundy because of the dangerous shingle banks in the fast flowing River Severn and Bristol Channel , with its tidal range of 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) , one of the greatest in the world . This made the island a profitable location from which to prey on passing Bristol @-@ bound merchant ships bringing back valuable goods from overseas . 
 In 1627 Barbary Pirates from the Republic of Salé occupied Lundy for five years . The North African invaders , under the command of Dutch renegade Jan Janszoon , flew an Ottoman flag over the island . Some captured Europeans were held on Lundy before being sent to Algiers as slaves . From 1628 to 1634 the island was plagued by pirate ships of French , Basque , English and Spanish origin . These incursions were eventually ended by Sir John Penington , but in the 1660s and as late as the 1700s the island still fell prey to French privateers . 
 = = = Civil war = = = 
 In the English Civil War , Thomas Bushell held Lundy for King Charles I , rebuilding Marisco Castle and garrisoning the island at his own expense . He was a friend of Francis Bacon , a strong supporter of the Royalist cause and an expert on mining and coining . It was the last Royalist territory held between the first and second civil wars . After receiving permission from Charles I , Bushell surrendered the island on 24 February 1647 to Richard Fiennes , representing General Fairfax . In 1656 , the island was acquired by Lord Saye and Sele . 
 = = = 18th and 19th centuries = = = 
 The late 18th and early 19th centuries were years of lawlessness on Lundy , particularly during the ownership of Thomas Benson ( 1708 @-@ 1772 ) , a Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1747 and Sheriff of Devon , who notoriously used the island for housing convicts whom he was supposed to be deporting . Benson leased Lundy from its owner , John Leveson @-@ Gower , 1st Earl Gower ( 1694 – 1754 ) ( who was an heir of the Grenville family of Bideford and of Stowe , Kilkhampton in Cornwall ) , at a rent of £ 60 per annum and contracted with the Government to transport a shipload of convicts to Virginia , but diverted the ship to Lundy to use the convicts as his personal slaves . Later Benson was involved in an insurance swindle . He purchased and insured the ship Nightingale and loaded it with a valuable cargo of pewter and linen . Having cleared the port on the mainland , the ship put into Lundy , where the cargo was removed and stored in a cave built by the convicts , before setting sail again . Some days afterwards , when a homeward @-@ bound vessel was sighted , the Nightingale was set on fire and scuttled . The crew were taken off the stricken ship by the other ship , which landed them safely at Clovelly . 
 Sir Vere Hunt , 1st Baronet of Curragh , purchased the island from John Cleveland in 1802 for £ 5 @,@ 270 ( £ 424 @,@ 400 today ) . Sir Vere Hunt planted in the island a small , self @-@ contained Irish colony with its own constitution and divorce laws , coinage and stamps . The tenants came from Sir Vere Hunt 's Irish estate and they experienced agricultural difficulties while on the island . This led Sir Vere Hunt to seek someone who would take the island off his hands , failing in his attempt to sell the island to the British Government as a base for troops . After the 1st Baronet 's death his son , Sir Aubrey ( Hunt ) de Vere , 2nd Baronet , also had great difficulty in securing any profit from the property . In the 1820s John <unk> agreed to purchase the island for £ 4 @,@ 500 but then refused to complete sale as he felt that the 2nd Baronet could not make out a good title in respect of the sale terms , namely that the island was free from tithes and taxes . 
 William Hudson Heaven purchased Lundy in 1834 , as a summer retreat and for the shooting , at a cost of 9 @,@ 400 guineas ( £ 9 @,@ 870 , or £ 855 @,@ 500 today ) . He claimed it to be a " free island " , and successfully resisted the jurisdiction of the mainland magistrates . Lundy was in consequence sometimes referred to as " the kingdom of Heaven " . It belongs in fact to the county of Devon , and has always been part of the hundred of Braunton . Many of the buildings on the island today , including St. Helena 's Church , designed by the architect John Norton , and Millcombe House ( originally known simply as the Villa ) , date from the Heaven period . The Georgian @-@ style villa was built in 1836 . However , the expense of building the road from the beach ( no financial assistance being provided by Trinity House , despite their regular use of the road following the construction of the lighthouses ) , the villa and the general cost of running the island had a ruinous effect on the family 's finances , which had been damaged by reduced profits from their sugar plantations in Jamaica . 
 In 1957 a message in a bottle from one of the seamen of the HMS Caledonia was washed ashore between Babbacombe and <unk> in Devon . The letter , dated 15 August 1843 read : " Dear Brother , Please e God i be with y against Michaelmas . Prepare y search Lundy for y Jenny ivories . <unk> William , Odessa " . The bottle and letter are on display at the <unk> Hotel at Fairy Cross , in Devon , England . The Jenny was a three @-@ masted schooner reputed to be carrying ivory and gold dust that was wrecked on Lundy ( at a place thereafter called Jenny 's Cove ) on 20 February 1797 . The ivory was apparently recovered some years later but the leather bags supposed to contain gold dust were never found .

 William Heaven was succeeded by his son the Reverend Hudson Grosset Heaven who , thanks to a legacy from Sarah Langworthy ( née Heaven ) , was able to fulfill his life 's ambition of building a stone church on the island . St Helen 's was completed in 1896 , and stands today as a lasting memorial to the Heaven period . It has been designated by English Heritage a Grade II listed building . He is said to have been able to afford either a church or a new harbour . His choice of the church was not however in the best financial interests of the island . The unavailability of the money for re @-@ establishing the family 's financial soundness , coupled with disastrous investment and speculation in the early 20th century , caused severe financial hardship . 
 Hudson Heaven died in 1916 , and was succeeded by his nephew , Walter Charles Hudson Heaven . With the outbreak of the First World War , matters deteriorated seriously , and in 1918 the family sold Lundy to Augustus Langham Christie . In 1924 , the Christie family sold the island along with the mail contract and the MV <unk> to Martin Coles Harman , who proclaimed himself a king . Harman issued two coins of Half Puffin and One Puffin denominations in 1929 , nominally equivalent to the British halfpenny and penny , resulting in his prosecution under the United Kingdom 's Coinage Act of 1870 . The House of Lords found him guilty in 1931 , and he was fined £ 5 with fifteen guineas ( £ 5 + £ 15 @.@ 75 ) expenses . The coins were withdrawn and became collectors ' items . In 1965 a " fantasy " restrike four @-@ coin set , a few in gold , was issued to commemorate 40 years since Harman purchased the island . Harman 's son , John Pennington Harman was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross during the Battle of Kohima , India in 1944 . There is a memorial to him at the VC Quarry on Lundy . Martin Coles Harman died in 1954 . 
 Residents did not pay taxes to the United Kingdom and had to pass through customs when they travelled to and from Lundy Island . Although the island was ruled as a virtual fiefdom , its owner never claimed to be independent of the United Kingdom , in contrast to later territorial " <unk> " . 
 Following the death of Harman 's son Albion in 1968 , Lundy was put up for sale in 1969 . Jack Hayward , a British millionaire , purchased the island for £ 150 @,@ 000 ( £ 2 @,@ 227 @,@ 000 today ) and gave it to the National Trust , who leased it to the Landmark Trust . The Landmark Trust has managed the island since then , deriving its income from arranging day trips , letting out holiday cottages and from donations . In May 2015 a sculpture by Antony Gormley was erected on Lundy . It is one of five life @-@ sized sculptures , Land , placed near the centre and at four compass points of the UK in a commission by the Landmark Trust , to celebrate its 50th anniversary . The others are at <unk> ( Warwickshire ) , Saddell Bay ( Scotland ) , the Martello Tower ( Aldeburgh , Suffolk ) , and Clavell Tower ( Kimmeridge Bay , Dorset ) . 
 The island is visited by over 20 @,@ 000 day @-@ trippers a year , but during September 2007 had to be closed for several weeks owing to an outbreak of Norovirus . 
 = = = = Wreck of Battleship Montagu = = = = 
 A naval footnote in the history of Lundy was the wreck of the Royal Navy battleship HMS Montagu . Steaming in heavy fog , she ran hard aground near Shutter Rock on the island 's southwest corner at about 2 : 00 a.m. on 30 May 1906 . Thinking they were aground at Hartland Point on the English mainland , a landing party went ashore for help , only finding out where they were after encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island 's north light . 
 Strenuous efforts by the Royal Navy to salvage the badly damaged battleship during the summer of 1906 failed , and in 1907 it was decided to give up and sell her for scrap . Montagu was scrapped at the scene over the next fifteen years . Diving clubs still visit the site , where armour plate and live 12 @-@ inch ( 305 @-@ millimetre ) shells remain on the seabed .

 During the Second World War two German Heinkel He 111 bombers crash landed on the island in 1941 . The first was on 3 March , when all the crew survived and were taken prisoner . The second was on 1 April when the pilot was killed and the other crew members were taken prisoner . The second plane had bombed a British ship and one engine was damaged by anti aircraft fire , forcing it to crash land . A few remains can be found on the crash site . Reportedly to avoid reprisals the crew concocted a story that they were on a reconnaissance mission . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The island of Lundy is 3 miles ( 5 km ) long from north to south by a little over 0 @.@ 6 miles ( 1 km ) wide , with an area of 1 @,@ 100 acres ( 450 ha ) . The highest point on Lundy is Beacon Hill , 469 feet ( 143 m ) above sea level , . A few yards off the northeastern coast is Seal 's Rock which is so called after the seals which rest on and inhabit the islet . It is less than 55 yards ( 50 m ) wide . Near the jetty is a small pocket beach . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 The island is primarily composed of granite of 50 ± 3 to 54 ± 2 million years ( from the Eocene epoch ) , with slate at the southern end ; the plateau soil is mainly loam , with some peat . Among the igneous dykes cutting the granite are a small number composed of a unique <unk> . This was given the name <unk> in 1914 , although the term – never precisely defined – has since fallen into disuse . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Lundy island lies on the borderline where the North Atlantic Ocean and the Bristol Channel meet , so it has quite a mild climate . Lundy has cool , wet winters and mild , wet summers . It is often windy . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Flora = = = 
 There is one endemic plant species , the Lundy cabbage ( Coincya wrightii ) , a species of primitive brassica . 
 By the 1980s the eastern side of the island had become overgrown by rhododendrons ( Rhododendron ponticum ) which had spread from a few specimens planted in the garden of Millcombe House in Victorian times , but eradication of this non @-@ native plant has been undertaken by volunteers over the past fifteen years in an operation known on the island as " <unk> @-@ bashing " . The vegetation on the plateau is mainly dry heath , with an area of waved Calluna heath towards the northern end of the island , which is also rich in lichens , such as <unk> <unk> and several species of Cladonia and <unk> . Other areas are either a dry heath / acidic grassland mosaic , characterised by heaths and western gorse ( Ulex gallii ) , or semi @-@ improved acidic grassland in which Yorkshire fog ( Holcus lanatus ) is abundant . <unk> ( Thrift ) ( Holcus / Armeria ) communities occur mainly on the western side , and some patches of bracken ( Pteridium aquilinum ) on the eastern side . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 = = = = Terrestrial invertebrates = = = = 
 Two invertebrate taxa are endemic to Lundy , with both feeding on the endemic Lundy cabbage ( Coincya wrightii ) . These are the Lundy cabbage flea beetle ( Psylliodes luridipennis ) , a species of leaf beetle ( family Chrysomelidae ) and the Lundy cabbage weevil ( Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes ) , a variety of true weevil ( family Curculionidae ) . In addition , the Lundy cabbage is the main host of a flightless form of Psylliodes napi ( another species of flea beetle ) and a wide variety of other invertebrate species which are not endemic to the island . Another resident invertebrate of note is <unk> affinis , the only British species of <unk> spider . 
 = = = = Birds = = = = 
 The number of puffins ( Fratercula arctica ) , which may have given the island its name , declined in the late 20th and early 21st centuries , with the 2005 breeding population estimated to be only two or three pairs , as a consequence of depredations by brown and black rats ( Rattus rattus ) ( which have now been eliminated ) and possibly also as a result of commercial fishing for sand eels , the puffins ' principal prey . Since 2005 , the breeding numbers have been slowly increasing . Adults were seen taking fish into four burrows in 2007 , and six burrows in 2008 . 
 As an isolated island on major migration routes , Lundy has a rich bird life and is a popular site for birdwatching . Large numbers of black @-@ legged kittiwake ( <unk> tridactyla ) nest on the cliffs , as do razorbill ( Alca torda ) , guillemot ( Uria aalge ) , herring gull ( Larus argentatus ) , lesser black @-@ backed gull ( Larus fuscus ) , fulmar ( <unk> glacialis ) , shag ( <unk> <unk> ) , oystercatcher ( Haematopus <unk> ) , skylark ( Alauda arvensis ) , meadow pipit ( Anthus pratensis ) , common blackbird ( Turdus merula ) , robin ( Erithacus rubecula ) and linnet ( Carduelis <unk> ) . There are also smaller populations of peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus ) and raven ( Corvus corax ) . 
 Lundy has attracted many vagrant birds , in particular species from North America . The island 's bird list totals 317 species . This has included the following species , each of which represents the sole British record : Ancient murrelet , eastern <unk> and eastern <unk> . Records of <unk> lark , American robin and common yellowthroat were also firsts for Britain ( American robin has also occurred two further times on Lundy ) . <unk> in 1987 and 1997 were Britain 's second and fourth records , a Rüppell 's warbler in 1979 was Britain 's second , an eastern Bonelli 's warbler in 2004 was Britain 's fourth , and a black @-@ faced bunting in 2001 Britain 's third . 
 Other British Birds rarities that have been sighted ( single records unless otherwise indicated ) are : Little bittern , glossy ibis , gyrfalcon ( 3 records ) , little and Baillon 's crakes , collared pratincole , semipalmated ( 5 records ) , least ( 2 records ) , white @-@ rumped and Baird 's ( 2 records ) sandpipers , Wilson 's phalarope , laughing gull , bridled tern , Pallas 's sandgrouse , great spotted , black @-@ billed and yellow @-@ billed ( 3 records ) cuckoos , European roller , olive @-@ backed pipit , citrine wagtail , Alpine accentor , thrush nightingale , red @-@ flanked <unk> , black @-@ eared ( 2 records ) and desert wheatears , White 's , Swainson 's ( 3 records ) , and grey @-@ cheeked ( 2 records ) thrushes , Sardinian ( 2 records ) , Arctic ( 3 records ) , Radde 's and western Bonelli 's warblers , <unk> and lesser grey shrikes , red @-@ eyed vireo ( 7 records ) , two @-@ barred crossbill , yellow @-@ rumped and blackpoll warblers , yellow @-@ breasted ( 2 records ) and black @-@ headed ( 3 records ) buntings , rose @-@ breasted grosbeak ( 2 records ) , <unk> and Baltimore oriole ( 2 records ) . 
 = = = = Mammals = = = = 
 Lundy is home to an unusual range of mammals , almost all introduced , including a distinct breed of wild pony , the Lundy pony . Until recently , Lundy and the Shiant Isles in the Hebrides were the only two places in the UK where the black rat ( Rattus rattus ) could be found regularly . In the rest of the United Kingdom they have largely been replaced by brown rats except for occasional sightings in port towns and the Thames Estuary . It has since been eradicated on the island , in order to protect the nesting seabirds . Other species which have made the island their home include the grey seal ( Halichoerus grypus ) , Sika deer ( Cervus <unk> ) , pygmy shrew ( Sorex minutus ) and feral goats ( Capra aegagrus hircus ) . Unusually , 20 % of the rabbits ( <unk> ) on the island are melanistic compared with 4 % which is typical in the UK . In mid @-@ 2006 the rabbit population was devastated by myxomatosis , leaving only 60 pairs from the previous 15 – 20 @,@ 000 individuals . Soay sheep ( Ovis aries ) on the island have been shown to vary their behaviours according to nutritional requirements , the distribution of food and the risk of predation . 
 = = = = Marine habitat = = = = 
 In 1971 a proposal was made by the Lundy Field Society to establish a marine reserve , and the survey was led by Dr Keith Hiscock , supported by a team of students from Bangor University . Provision for the establishment of statutory Marine Nature Reserves was included in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 , and on 21 November 1986 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced the designation of a statutory reserve at Lundy . 
 There is an outstanding variety of marine habitats and wildlife , and a large number of rare and unusual species in the waters around Lundy , including some species of seaweed , branching sponges , sea fans and cup corals . 
 In 2003 the first statutory No Take Zone ( NTZ ) for marine nature conservation in the UK was set up in the waters to the east of Lundy island . In 2008 this was declared as having been successful in several ways including the increasing size and number of lobsters within the reserve , and potential benefits for other marine wildlife . However , the no take zone has received a mixed reaction from local fishermen . 
 On 12 January 2010 the island became Britain 's first Marine Conservation Zone designated under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 , designed to help to preserve important habitats and species .

 = = = To the island = = = 
 There are two ways to get to Lundy , depending on the time of year . In the summer months ( April to October ) visitors are carried on the Landmark Trust 's own vessel , MS Oldenburg , which sails from both Bideford and Ilfracombe . <unk> are usually three days a week , on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays , with additional sailings on Wednesdays during July and August . The voyage takes on average two hours , depending on ports , tides and weather . The Oldenburg was first registered in Bremen , Germany in 1958 and has been sailing to Lundy since her engine was replaced in 1985 . 
 In the winter months ( November to March ) , the Oldenburg is out of service , and the island is served by a scheduled helicopter service from Hartland Point . The helicopter operates on Mondays and Fridays , with flights between 12 noon and 2 pm . The heliport is a field at the top of Hartland Point , not far from the Beacon . 
 A grass runway of 435 by 30 yards ( 398 by 27 m ) is available , allowing access to small STOL aircraft skilfully piloted . 
 Properly equipped and experienced canoeists can kayak to the island from Hartland Point or Lee Bay . This takes 4 to 6 hours depending on wind and tides . 
 Entrance to Lundy is free for anyone arriving by scheduled transport . Visitors arriving by non @-@ scheduled transport are charged an entrance fee , currently ( May 2016 ) £ 6 @.@ 00 , and there is an additional charge payable by those using light aircraft . Anyone arriving on Lundy by non @-@ scheduled transport is also charged an additional fee for transporting luggage to the top of the island .

 In 2007 , Derek Green , Lundy 's general manager , launched an appeal to raise £ 250 @,@ 000 to save the mile @-@ long Beach Road , which had been damaged by heavy rain and high seas . The road was built in the first half of the 19th century to provide people and goods with safe access to the top of the island , 120 metres ( 394 ft ) above the only jetty . The fund @-@ raising was completed on 10 March 2009 . 
 = = = Lighthouses = = = 
 Foundations for a lighthouse on Lundy were laid in 1787 , but the first lighthouse ( now known as the Old Light ) was not built until Trinity House obtained a 999 @-@ year lease in 1819 . The 97 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) granite tower , on the summit of Chapel Hill , was designed by Daniel Asher Alexander , and built by Joseph Nelson at a cost of £ 36 @,@ 000 . Because the site , Beacon Hill , is 469 feet ( 143 m ) above sea level , the highest base for a lighthouse in Britain , the light was often obscured by fog . To counter this problem , the Fog Signal Battery was built about 1861 . 
 The lighthouse had two lights ; the lower a fixed white light and the upper a quick flashing white light , showing every 60 seconds . However , this quick revolution gave the impression it was a fixed light with no flashes detectable . This may have contributed to the grounding , at Cefn <unk> , of the La Jeune Emma , bound from Martinique to Cherbourg in 1828 . 13 of the 19 on board drowned , including Adeline Coquelin , the 12 @-@ year @-@ old niece of Napoleon Bonaparte 's divorced wife Joséphine de Beauharnais . 
 Owing to the ongoing complaints about the difficulty of sighting the light in fog , the lighthouse was abandoned in 1897 when the North and South Lundy lighthouses were built . The Old Light and the associated keepers ' houses are kept open by the Landmark Trust . 
 The current North Lundy and South Lundy lighthouses were built in 1897 at the extremities of the island to replace the old lighthouse . Both lighthouses are painted white and are run and maintained by Trinity House . 
 The North lighthouse is 56 feet ( 17 m ) tall , slightly taller than the south one , and has a focal plane of 157 ft ( 48 m ) . It produces a quick white flash every 15 seconds , and was originally lit by a 75 mm ( 3 in ) petroleum vapour burner . Oil was lifted up from a small quay using a sled and winch , and then transported using a small railway ( again winch @-@ powered ) . The remains of this can be still seen , but it was abandoned in 1971 and the lighthouse now uses a discharge bulb fed from the island 's main supply . The northern light was modernised in 1991 and converted to solar power , since when the light has been mounted on top of the old fog horn building rather than in the tower . 
 The South lighthouse has a focal length of 174 feet ( 53 m ) and a quick white flash every 5 seconds . It can be seen as a small white dot from Hartland Point , 11 miles to the south east . It was automated and converted to solar power in 1994 . The old fresnel lens has been in use since 2001 in Dungeness Lighthouse . 
 = = Electricity supply = = 
 There is a small power station comprising three Cummins B and C series diesel engines , offering an approx 150 <unk> 3 phase supply to most of the island buildings . Waste heat from the engine jackets is used for a district heating pipe . There are also plans to collect the waste heat from the engine exhaust heat gases to feed into the district heat network to improve the efficiency further . The Power is normally switched off between 0000 and 0630 
 = = Staying on the island = = 
 Lundy has 23 holiday properties , sleeping between one and 14 people . These include a lighthouse , a castle and a Victorian mansion . Many of the buildings are constructed from the island 's granite . 
 The island also has a campsite , at the south of the island in the field next to the shop . It has hot and cold running water , with showers and toilets , in an adjacent building . 
 The island is popular with rock climbers , having the UK 's longest continuous slab climb , " The Devil 's Slide . " 
 = = Administration = = 
 The island is an unparished area of Torridge district of the English county of Devon . It forms part of the ward of Clovelly Bay . It is part of the constituency electing the Member of Parliament for Torridge and West Devon and the South West England constituency for the European Parliament . 
 = = = Stamps = = = 
 Owing to a decline in population and lack of interest in the mail contract , the GPO ended its presence on Lundy at the end of 1927 . For the next two years Harman handled the mail to and from the island without charge . On 1 November 1929 , he decided to offset the expense by issuing two postage stamps ( ½ puffin in pink and 1 puffin in blue ) . One puffin is equivalent to one English penny . The printing of Puffin stamps continues to this day and they are available at face value from the Lundy Post Office . One used to have to stick Lundy stamps on the back of the envelope ; but Royal Mail now allows their use on the front of the envelope , but placed on the left side , with the right side reserved for the Royal Mail postage stamp or stamps . Lundy stamps are cancelled by a circular Lundy <unk> . The face value of the Lundy Island stamps covers the cost of postage of letters and postcards from the island to the Bideford Post Office on the mainland for onward delivery to their final destination anywhere in the world . The Lundy Post Office gets a bulk rate discount for mailing letters and postcards from Bideford . Lundy stamps are a type of postage stamp known to <unk> as " local carriage labels " or " local stamps " . Issues of increasing value were made over the years , including air mail , featuring a variety of people . Many are now highly sought @-@ after by collectors . The market value of the early issues has risen substantially over the years . For the many thousands of annual visitors Lundy stamps have become part of the collection of the many British Local Posts collectors . The first catalogues of these stamps included Gerald Rosen 's 1970 Catalogue of British Local Stamps . Later specialist catalogues include Stamps of Lundy Island by Stanley Newman , first published in 1984 , Phillips Modern British Locals CD Catalogue , published since 2003 , and Labbe 's Specialised Guide to Lundy Island Stamps , published since 2005 and now in its 11th Edition . Labbe 's Guide is considered the gold standard of Lundy catalogues owing to its extensive approach to varieties , errors , specialised items and " fantasy " issues . There is a comprehensive collection of these stamps in the Chinchen Collection , donated by Barry Chinchen to the British Library Philatelic Collections in 1977 and now held by the British Library . This is also the home of the Landmark Trust Lundy Island Philatelic Archive which includes artwork , texts and essays as well as <unk> devices and issued stamps .

 = Colorado State Highway 82 = 
 State Highway 82 ( SH 82 ) is an 85 @.@ 3 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 137 @.@ 3 km ) state highway in the U.S. state of Colorado . Its western half provides the principal transportation artery of the Roaring Fork Valley on the Colorado Western Slope , beginning at Interstate 70 ( I @-@ 70 ) and U.S. Highway 6 ( US 6 ) Glenwood Springs southeast past Carbondale , Basalt and Aspen . From there it continues up the valley to cross the Continental Divide at Independence Pass . On the Eastern Slope , it follows Lake Creek past some of Colorado 's highest mountains to Twin Lakes Reservoir , where it ends at US 24 south of Leadville . 
 At 12 @,@ 095 feet ( 3 @,@ 687 m ) above sea level , the traverse of Independence Pass is the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in North America , and the highest paved through road on Colorado 's state highway network . The pass is closed during the winter months , isolating Aspen from the east and making Highway 82 the only way to reach the popular ski resort town by road . A private foundation has worked with the Colorado Department of Transportation ( CDOT ) , which maintains the road , to undo environmental damage to the alpine tundra created when a disused stagecoach route built across the pass during the Colorado Silver Boom of the 1880s became Highway 82 in the early 20th century . 
 West of Aspen the highway follows the route of an early Colorado Midland Railroad route from the city to Glenwood Springs . Paved during the 1930s , this road has been gradually expanded to four lanes over the course of the 20th and early 21st centuries . The increased traffic resulting from Aspen 's economic rebirth as a resort town has required high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes , bypasses and the replacement of at least one old bridge . More improvements are planned for both Aspen and Glenwood Springs . 
 = = Route description = = 
 From its western terminus to Aspen , Highway 82 is a four @-@ lane road , frequently divided . As it leaves Aspen , it narrows to two lanes and remains that way to its eastern terminus . Two sets of gates on either side of Independence Pass allow the road to be closed in winter . 
 = = = Glenwood Springs to Carbondale = = = 
 Highway 82 begins at Exit 116 from I @-@ 70 in Glenwood Springs , just 300 ft ( 100 m ) east of the Roaring Fork 's confluence with the Colorado River . It follows Laurel Street north for one block , then turns east on Sixth Street for another block , after which it turns south on Grand Avenue . From there it crosses both I @-@ 70 and the Colorado River on a viaduct past the train station into downtown Glenwood Springs . 
 It continues south through blocks of small @-@ scale dense urban development to 14th Street . Glenwood Springs High School is on the west just past the intersection heralds the end of downtown . For two blocks the land around the road becomes a commercial strip with large parking lots . At Hyland Park on the east just afterwards , the land across the road is devoted to larger houses on larger lots . Strip development resumes on the west side south of 19th Street , two blocks west of Valley View Hospital . At 23rd Street , Highway 82 turns southeast to follow South Glen Avenue , paralleling the adjacent Rio Grande rail trail . Development along the highway becomes predominantly commercial , and south of 27th Street a continuous strip begins on the east side as the valley narrows . After passing Rosebud Cemetery on the west side , Highway 82 turns more to the southeast and draws alongside the Roaring Fork as it reaches the city limits . 
 Following the river 's bend , the road returns to its southern heading as most development focuses around Glenwood Springs Municipal Airport on the opposite bank . At its next easterly turn , the landscape around the road becomes more rural , with farms and golf courses appearing . The terrain remains generally level , at about 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) above sea level . 
 A mile south of the airport , at a signalized intersection with Old State Route 82 , the road divides . Highway 82 turns eastward again , returning to its southerly heading after another mile when Spring Valley Road turns off to the Glenwood Springs campus of Colorado Mountain College in the mountains to the north . A half @-@ mile ( 1 km ) beyond that junction , at the headquarters of the Garfield County Road and Bridge District , the highway begins a long stretch with a southerly heading . 
 After two miles , the road bends to the southeast amidst a valley with occasional subdivisions . Two more miles down the highway , at a rest area , Highway 82 turns east as it enters the city of Carbondale across the river . A mile from the rest area , a traffic signal controls the intersection with State Highway 133 , the only other state highway to intersect 82 for its entire length . From Carbondale , Highway 133 leads south to Redstone and McClure Pass along the valley of a tributary of the Roaring Fork , the Crystal River . To the south the 12 @,@ 953 @-@ foot ( 3 @,@ 948 m ) Mount <unk> dominates the view . 
 = = = Carbondale to Aspen = = = 
 A mile east of Highway 133 , the valley floor widens , filled with farms and subdivisions as the road gently trends to the south . Five miles ( 8 km ) east of Carbondale , Highway 82 crosses into Eagle County . Subdivisions begin to increase in the surrounding valley and the road soon turns to the south again as it passes a built @-@ up area and then crosses the Roaring Fork . A mile and a half after that Highway 82 crosses the Roaring Fork and then enters Pitkin County at the small unincorporated community of Emma . 
 Basalt is one mile due east . The intersection with Basalt Avenue , the main route into that town from Highway 82 , has a signal . Between Glenwood Springs and Basalt , Highway 82 climbs 600 feet ( 180 m ) in elevation . As it alternately tracks southeast and south over the next 16 miles ( 26 km ) towards Aspen , it begins to climb more noticeably and the valley narrows . Development becomes less dense , with many small ranches located aside the road and along the river . Three miles ( 5 km ) south of Basalt , after another crossing of the Roaring Fork , the right lanes in both directions are marked with diamonds indicating they are high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes during peak hours . The median is soon replaced with a guardrail , then a brief retaining wall where the eastbound roadway is slightly elevated . 
 The ascent continues near Woody Creek . As Aspen – Pitkin County Airport appears on the west of the road , three miles ( 5 km ) south of Woody Creek , the roadways merge as development around the highway increases . 
 Beyond the airport , Highway 82 turns due south . It bends to the southeast to cross the new Maroon Creek Bridge , with the original , listed on the National Register of Historic Places , immediately to its south . At this point , with a golf course on the north side , the Aspen city limit begins to follow the road , and by the time it goes through a roundabout and passes the Holden / <unk> Mining and Ranching Museum to the south it is fully in the city of Aspen . Another stream crossing , Castle Creek , brings the highway into the developed portion of the city . 
 = = = Aspen to Independence Pass = = = 
 From Basalt , Highway 82 has climbed 1 @,@ 300 feet ( 400 m ) . It levels out at Aspen , entering the city 's residential West End along West Hallam Street . A block east of Castle Creek , it turns south on North Seventh Street ; the intersection 's southwest corner has been rounded to smooth the traffic flow , leaving a triangular traffic island in the middle of the road . Two blocks further south , at another intersection with a rounded corner , SH 82 turns east to follow West Main Street across Aspen . 
 Five blocks east , at Garmisch Street , it becomes East Main Street . The buildings gradually change from residential to commercial , and at Mill Street Highway 82 passes one of Aspen 's major landmarks , the Hotel Jerome , also listed on the National Register . Two blocks further is another listed landmark , the Pitkin County Courthouse , between Galena and Hunter streets . 
 After the Spring Street intersection another two blocks past the courthouse , Main Street curves to the south , narrowing in the process . It is now a two @-@ lane road . Two blocks to the south , SH 82 turns east again to follow East Cooper Avenue , crossing the Roaring Fork again after another two blocks . The highway curves southward , leaving Aspen three @-@ quarters of a mile ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) further east . 
 The valley narrows into a canyon as the road begins to climb again , closely hugging the north wall . Four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) east of the city , just past <unk> Lake Road , it passes the gates where the road is closed in wintertime . Past this point development along the road abates as most of the land alongside the road is part of White River National Forest . On the north side of the road are some of Aspen 's more popular climbing cliffs ; on the south side are many small parking areas for trailheads , campgrounds and popular swimming holes along the Roaring Fork like Devil 's Punchbowl . 
 There are several short sections where past rockslides have forced the road to narrow to one lane . Access is controlled via traffic lights . The remaining log cabins and other structures of the ghost town of Independence , also listed on the National Register , are visible in the valley below at 13 @.@ 5 miles ( 21 @.@ 7 km ) east of Aspen . 
 Shortly afterwards , Highway 82 crosses the Roaring Fork for the last time , a few miles below its source at Independence Lake . The road then turns along the canyon 's headwall to the south . After a switchback to the north , it climbs above tree @-@ line and into the high @-@ elevation alpine tundra landscape of Independence Pass , 19 miles ( 31 km ) from Aspen . 
 = = = Independence Pass to Twin Lakes = = = 
 The road levels out to a parking area on the south side . A U.S. Forest Service sign indicates the Continental Divide and gives the elevation as 12 @,@ 095 feet ( 3 @,@ 687 m ) . The Divide also marks the Lake County line . A paved path leads to a scenic overlook with views to Mount Elbert ( 14 @,@ 440 feet ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) ) and La Plata Peak ( 14 @,@ 336 feet ( 4 @,@ 370 m ) ) , respectively the highest and fifth @-@ highest peaks in Colorado and the Rocky Mountains . An old road leads south along the ridge to summits to the south . 
 Beyond the pass , the road descends through three more long switchbacks to the floor of the Lake Creek valley . From there it heads south at first but quickly curving to the east . As it assumes that heading it passes the other set of gates , just west of the very small settlement of Everett , near where Lake Creek 's North Fork joins the main stream . 
 From there the road heads east for the next four miles , passing trailheads for both of the <unk> on either side and other San Isabel National Forest facilities . Just before the creek widens and empties into Twin Lakes Reservoir , the road curves quickly to the south and then heads more to the northeast along the lake shore . A mile past that bend Highway 82 reaches the small community of Twin Lakes , also listed on the National Register as a historic district as an early tourist town . 
 The highway continues northeast for another mile beyond Twin Lakes and then turns east , with a continuous view of the lakes on the south . Shortly past this turn , the Colorado Trail crosses the road and then runs closely parallel to it along the south side . Forest Service roads go down that direction to access points along the lake . After another mile , Highway 82 turns southeast for its next mile . Below the lakes ' outlet , it crosses Lake Creek for the last time and then ends at US 24 18 miles ( 29 km ) from Independence Pass and just below the confluence of the creek and the Arkansas River . Leadville is 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the north ; in the opposite direction it is 21 miles ( 34 km ) to Buena Vista . 
 = = Independence Pass closures and restrictions = = 
 Because of the high altitude of Independence Pass , winter weather there begins well before the season itself starts . The snow falls deep through the season , and remains so throughout the spring . The Colorado Department of Transportation ( CDOT ) therefore closes the gates at both ends of the 24 @-@ mile ( 39 km ) stretch of Highway 82 leading over the pass during those months . Typically it is closed by November 7 or the first significant winter snowfall , if that comes earlier . The pass is usually reopened just before Memorial Day weekend at the end of May after CDOT has cleared the snowpack and repaired the road . Some years when the snowfall has been lighter , the reopening has occurred several weeks earlier . 
 The narrow roadway , switchbacks , steep 6 % grades and steep , sometimes unguarded dropoffs on either approach to the pass have also led CDOT to impose 10 mph ( 16 km / h ) speed limits at the turns . Some types of vehicles are banned from the pass year @-@ round . Oversized and overweight vehicles are prohibited , as well as any vehicle or vehicle combinations longer than 35 feet ( 11 m ) . As a practical matter this excludes tractor trailers , buses and recreational vehicles . 
 Some truck drivers have used the pass despite the prohibition . They are generally either unaware of the restriction and following routes plotted by their GPS devices , or aware of it and willing to risk the fine for the sake of the time and distance saved . The resulting accidents have forced the closure of the pass . CDOT has put in larger signs advising drivers of the ban and worked with GPS device manufacturers so their software notes the restriction . Aspen officials have suggested the fines be increased as well . 
 Independence Pass is popular with bicyclists , and since 2011 it has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge around Colorado . Racers cross the pass during a 131 @-@ mile ( 211 km ) stage from Gunnison to Aspen . The highway is closed for the race from its western terminus to the end of the stage . 
 = = History = = 
 Both halves of the road trace their origins to the early days of Aspen 's settlement in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom . Prospectors who had missed out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west , drawn by reports of vast untapped silver deposits in the Roaring Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide . They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass , in defiance of an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people .

 The future eastern half of Highway 82 came first , as a rough path over Independence Pass that soon reached Aspen . A private company improved it into a toll road for stagecoaches , open year @-@ round . The city 's rapid growth fostered a race to make the first rail connection , which displaced the toll road as the primary route to Aspen within a decade . Later , the railroad 's right @-@ of @-@ way would serve as the basis for the highway . 
 = = = = Stage road over Independence Pass = = = = 
 On July 4 , 1879 , the settlement of Independence was established just west of the pass , taking its name from the Independence Day holiday , and soon lending it to the pass among other natural features in the area . Independence 's gold deposits were quickly opened by miners . By the following year the Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company had improved the path through the pass , which followed a route close to Highway 82 's present alignment , to the point that horses could make the trip . 
 The company 's goal was to continue down the valley and connect to some existing mining camps such as Ashcroft . Miners had preferred to take a longer route there from Leadville , via Cottonwood and Taylor passes to the south . A viable route over Independence Pass would shorten that journey by 40 miles ( 64 km ) . 
 Settlement continued to follow the river down the valley . At the confluence with Castle Creek , the valley widened and offered a flood plain conducive to the development of a town . The slopes of the surrounding mountains proved to have the silver deposits the prospectors had anticipated , and very soon the mining camp became a small city , named Aspen after the trees that filled the surrounding forests . It grew rapidly , becoming the seat of the newly created Pitkin County , named after the governor its earliest settlers had disobeyed by coming there . 
 With more and more people coming to Aspen , a better road from the east was needed . An early investor in the city , B. Clark Wheeler , put up the money needed to improve the path over the pass to a stage road . It opened in November 1881 , just as winter was beginning . The tolls , 25 cents for saddle horses and twice that for stages ( $ 6 and $ 12 in modern dollars respectively ) were primarily spent hiring a large crew of men who kept the pass clear in winter with <unk> . They were able to keep the road through the pass open during its first five winters . In deep enough snow passengers switched to sleighs ; in summer , dogs ran in advance to warn oncoming traffic through the pass itself as the stages took the switchbacks at full speed . It usually took a stage 10 – 25 hours and five changes of horses to reach Aspen from Twin Lakes . 
 = = = = Rail routes from Glenwood Springs = = = = 
 The road over the pass was barely capable of handling the massive amounts of silver ore coming out of Aspen 's mines . At first they had to be taken to Leadville by mule train to be smelted . Plants were built in the city soon afterwards , but it was still difficult and expensive to transport the silver obtained . The market was growing in the wake of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act , which required the U.S. government to buy the metal on a regular basis . 
 A railroad link to Aspen was therefore likely to be highly profitable , and two railroads , the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western , hoped to be the first . In the early 1880s , however , neither seemed able to do so . The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything . The Rio Grande was building , but too quickly , forcing it into receivership . Financially cautious from its recent troubles , it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president 's enthusiasm for the project . 
 New leadership at both companies started the race to Aspen . James John Hagerman joined the Midland in 1885 , refreshing the company coffers with his mining fortune . A year later the railroad had laid 250 miles ( 400 km ) of track from Colorado Springs to Leadville and crossed the Continental Divide via the Hagerman Tunnel , then the world 's highest . It got to Glenwood Springs and began working its way up the valley to Aspen . 
 David Moffat became the Rio Grande 's president in 1885 and persuaded the company 's other executives to go ahead with the Aspen connection . To overcome the Midland 's lead , they built a narrow @-@ gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork , today the route of the Rio Grande Trail . Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing , which was causing complications for the Midland , saved considerable time , and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887 . Working through the winter , the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later . 
 = = = 1889 – 1926 : Abandonment and reuse as state highway = = = 
 The opening of the rail connections was a death blow to the stage road . Gold production in Independence had declined sharply after 1884 , and many of the town 's early settlers had moved down the valley to Aspen . With the corresponding reduction in stage traffic and tolls , the Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company could not afford to keep the road clear over the winter of 1886 . Two years later , after the railroads began service , the company folded and abandoned the road . Independence itself met the same fate a decade later when its remaining population decamped to Aspen during the severe winter of 1899 , leaving its buildings standing as a ghost town ( one remaining resident lingered until 1920 ) . 
 On the other side of Aspen , the railroads initially enjoyed great success . The Rio Grande line was upgraded to standard gauge in 1890 , and for the next several years both it and the Midland were at capacity . But when the Panic of 1893 began , Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act , instantly collapsing the silver market . Many Aspen mines closed , and miners left the city for new boomtowns like Cripple Creek . The ensuing decades saw a steady decline in Aspen 's population , a period referred to as the " quiet years " of the city 's history . 
 There was still enough mining to keep the railroads busy , but not for long . In 1897 the Midland went bankrupt . It continued operating , and a new company formed under the same name to take over . In 1919 Smuggler Mine , the city 's largest and oldest , shut down most of its operations and several others closed . The second Midland again succumbed to bankruptcy ; there was no second resurrection . Its tracks and right @-@ of @-@ way , including the bridges , were abandoned . 
 They soon reverted to state ownership . The Colorado Highway Commission used them to realize plans it had made a decade earlier , when it first designated the future Highway 82 through the Roaring Fork Valley . With the Midland 's tracks unused , it now had a graded route that could easily be adapted for highway purposes . 
 = = = 1927 – 1961 : Conversion to highway = = = 
 Before developing the route west of Aspen , the state turned its attention the other way . In 1927 it rebuilt the old stage road over Independence Pass to Twin Lakes and designated it part of Highway 82 , closing it in winters to avoid the maintenance costs . Most of it followed the original route ; however in some places it deviated . The largest section of the original remains three miles ( 5 km ) below the pass on the east approach . The foundation of the gatekeeper 's house remains , as well as some of the original toll gate . 
 During the Depression , the state sought to ease unemployment through public works projects as an economic stimulus . It applied this to the new Highway 82 . First it converted the Maroon Creek Bridge for automotive traffic by widening it with a timber deck , which was then paved and supported with outriggers . In 1937 , four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale was paved ; the remainder of the road to Aspen was oiled the following year . 
 It had been the hope that the improvements in the valley 's road transportation would benefit the remaining mines . While the ranchers were able to get their products to market faster , the new road would catalyze Aspen 's economic revival in an industry that had not existed when the Depression began : recreational downhill skiing . As Highway 82 was being improved , skiing enthusiasts from both the U.S. and Central Europe were cutting trails and building a primitive ski lift on the mountain south of town . The 1940 census recorded an increase in Aspen 's population , the first in a half @-@ century . 
 Further development was halted during the war years afterward , although the Tenth Mountain Division , which trained at nearby Camp Hale , came to appreciate Aspen and its skiing . Many of them came back to Aspen after the war , helping to expand and staff the ski resort . Coincidentally , Walter Paepcke , head of the Container Corporation of America , visited Aspen with his wife Elizabeth in the late 1940s , and found it an ideal place to establish a music festival they were planning . He invested heavily in the city 's redevelopment , and people began coming to Aspen again to live , work and play . While the Rio Grande 's trains still ran , many new visitors and arrivals preferred to drive . 
 = = = 1962 – 2000 : Expansion = = = 
 By 1960 the population of Pitkin County had increased by 44 % , the second @-@ fastest growth rate on the Western Slope . The Aspen Skiing Company built two additional resorts , Buttermilk and Snowmass , to the west , contributing to traffic on the highway . In 1962 the Colorado Department of Highways , began a 12 @-@ year project to expand Highway 82 to four lanes between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale . The Maroon Creek Bridge was widened in 1963 to handle its increased traffic . 
 On the east , the road over Independence Pass was paved in 1967 . The Rio Grande discontinued passenger train service to Aspen in 1969 . It was soon replaced the next year , when the completion of Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon connected the western terminus of Highway 82 to the larger Interstate Highway System . 
 In the 1980s , it became apparent that four lanes at the western end was not enough . Several safety improvement areas were identified and projects implemented . In 1988 the Basalt Bypass relocated the highway off its original alignment through that town ( currently Two Rivers Road ) , to a new two @-@ lane road to the south of it that crossed the Roaring Fork to the east of the town . 
 At the end of the decade , the Independence Pass Foundation ( IPF ) was formally incorporated in Aspen . Its founder , environmental activist Bob Lewis , had been organizing efforts to revegetate the slopes alongside Highway 82 going up to the pass , in order to repair damage that had been done the road 's construction . In cooperation with the Highway Department , the U.S. Forest Service and the county , the IPF rebuilt a curve along the road near the Weller Lake trailhead that year . 
 Safety improvements continued in the 1990s . A five @-@ mile ( 8 km ) stretch just west of Aspen was resurfaced in 1991 . A special skid @-@ resistant treatment was added to the areas that receive no sun in the winter due to shade from Shale Bluffs . The next year , in 1992 , three two @-@ year projects began expanding Highway 82 to four lanes between Carbondale and Basalt , including the new bypass . An old truss bridge near Wingo Junction was replaced in 1995 ; it was followed over the remainder of the decade by widening most of the remaining sections between Basalt and Aspen . At the Maroon Creek Bridge outside Aspen , a pedestrian bridge was built to the north to take foot traffic off the older bridge in an effort to relieve congestion . 
 The high @-@ occupancy vehicle ( HOV ) lanes were designated in 1998 . When they opened , they were the first anywhere in a rural area of Colorado . In a departure from the usual practice , the diamonds were painted in the right lanes rather than the left , so that Roaring Fork Transportation Authority ( <unk> ) buses could get to and from their stops more easily . 
 East of Aspen , the IPF began holding its annual Ride for the Pass bicycle race fundraiser in 1994 . The race has been held almost every year since on the weekend before CDOT opens the pass . It follows a 9 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 15 @.@ 3 km ) course from the gate to Independence . Two years after the first one the IPF began the project Lewis had always envisioned for it — restoring the Top Cut , the 1 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) section just below the pass on the east , where the environmental damage , especially erosion , had always been most evident . 
 = = = 2000 – present : Four continuous lanes = = = 
 In the new century CDOT began the projects that would complete the four @-@ lane expansion . It took one year to finish the expansion from Aspen Airport Business Center to Buttermilk . Three years later , in 2004 , the section in Snowmass Canyon was expanded to four lanes at a cost of $ 100 million . 
 Highway 82 was now a four @-@ lane road all the way from Glenwood Springs to Aspen . But that traffic still had to narrow to two lanes to cross the Maroon Creek Bridge at the latter city 's western boundary . The old bridge , listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985 , was functionally obsolete and structurally deficient . Cracks and other damage were forcing temporary closures of the bridge to trucks . Over 100 years old by that point , the oldest bridge in use on a Colorado highway , it could not be expanded any further . 
 A 1990 CDOT design proposal for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition . In 2004 the city of Aspen and the town of Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge . CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year . Construction of the segmental concrete box @-@ girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below , a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter . 
 The new bridge cost $ 14 million and was opened in the middle of 2008 . The old bridge remains in place next to it as a pedestrian walkway and historic landmark . The National Segmental Bridge Institute recognized CDOT and the new bridge with a Bridge Award for Excellence in 2010 .

 With the widening of the highway to four lanes between Glenwood Springs and Aspen complete , CDOT has turned its attention to the ends of that corridor . 
 = = = Entrance to Aspen = = = 
 By the 21st century , Highway 82 had grown to four lanes . It was easier for traffic to get to Aspen but did not resolve the congestion that developed when it got there . Since the 1970s various plans to alleviate the congestion had been put forth , some involving ballot initiatives decided by the voters of the city and / or county . In 1998 CDOT and the Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) , after considering all the proposals and taking public input , released a Record of Decision . The preferred alternative combined highway and intersection improvements , mass transit and incremental transportation management . 
 Some of the recommended improvements , such as the roundabout , replacement Maroon Creek Bridge , and improvements to the intersections along Highway 82 between the city and the airport , have been implemented . Right @-@ of @-@ way easements have been acquired for a new two @-@ lane parkway , as authorized by voters , that would cross the Holden / <unk> property via a 400 @-@ foot ( 120 m ) cut and cover tunnel to reconnect to the existing highway at Main and Seventh streets . City voters also authorized light rail for that route . 
 If built , the light rail would have as its western terminus a maintenance facility across Highway 82 from the airport . It would include a stop at Buttermilk and parallel the highway , using the old Maroon Creek Bridge , until it reached Monarch Street downtown . There it would turn south to its eastern terminus at <unk> Park . If there is not sufficient support or funding for the light rail , it could be built as bus lanes at first . 
 Proposed transportation management strategies are aimed at keeping traffic into Aspen at the baseline 1993 level through 2015 . There are three levels . The first would be when that baseline is equalled or slightly exceeded . It would consist of promoting ride sharing and more extensive transit use , among other informational measures . At Level 2 , when traffic reaches a few percentage points above that level , more transit service would be added , and parking rates raised slightly to reduce headways . Level 3 would be implemented when traffic levels had exceeded the baseline by 5 – 10 % , and would use more forceful measures such as steeper increases in parking fees , deliberately limiting the number of spaces available , and making some parts of downtown Aspen car @-@ free zones . 
 = = = Grand Avenue Bridge = = = 
 The current bridge along Grand Avenue over the Colorado River and I @-@ 70 just east of the highway 's western terminus dates to 1953 . It was built as a two @-@ lane bridge with shoulders ; expansion since then has added a second lane in either direction . By the early 21st century it , like the Maroon Creek Bridge , was carrying more traffic than it had ever been expected to and was in poor structural condition . 
 In the early 2000s CDOT began considering plans for a replacement bridge . The major issue was whether a new bridge should be built along the same alignment as the existing bridge , or instead curve westward to make a more direct connection with the interstate 's Exit 116 . After a public hearing in August 2012 , the agency announced that the latter seemed to be overwhelmingly preferred . It remained to decide whether to have a signalized intersection or a roundabout at the intersection of Sixth Street and Laurel Avenue . 
 Some residents of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely , as it did in Basalt . They contend that a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to Grand and make downtown less attractive to those who would like to shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations down the valley . The bypass , they claim , is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less . They have lobbied Glenwood Springs ' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT to reconsider the bypass .

 = Ngô Đình Cẩn = 
 Ngô Đình Cẩn ( 1911 – 9 May 1964 ) was a younger brother and confidant of South Vietnam 's first president , Ngô Đình Diệm , and an important member of the Diệm government . Diệm put Cẩn in charge of central Vietnam , stretching from Phan Thiết in the south to the border at the 17th parallel , with Cẩn ruling the region as a virtual dictator . Based in the former imperial capital of Huế , Cẩn operated private armies and secret police that controlled the central region and earned himself a reputation as the most oppressive of the Ngô brothers . 
 In his youth , Cẩn was a follower of the nationalist Phan Bội Châu . In the late 1940s and early 1950s , he worked to organise support for Diệm as various Vietnamese groups and international powers sought to stamp their authority over Vietnam . Cẩn , who succeeded in eliminating alternative nationalist opposition in central Vietnam , became the warlord of the region when his brother became president of the southern half of the partitioned nation in 1955 . He became notorious for his involvement in smuggling and corruption , as well as his autocratic rule . Cẩn was regarded as an effective leader against the Viet Cong communist insurgency , which was much weaker in central Vietnam than in other parts of South Vietnam . His Popular Force militia was regarded by US officials in central Vietnam as a successful counter to the communists . 
 Cẩn 's influence began to wane after his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was appointed the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế . Thục overshadowed Cẩn and aggressively promoted Catholicism , which led to the banning of the Buddhist flag in 1963 during Vesak , the celebration of the birthday of Gautama Buddha . Cẩn 's forces opened fire on a crowd who were protesting the ban , killing nine and precipitating the Buddhist crisis . Ongoing demonstrations intensified throughout the summer as the regime responded with increased brutality , sparking the toppling of the Diem regime in a November 1963 coup . Cẩn had been offered asylum by the US Department of State , but ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr. had CIA agent Lucien Conein arrest the fallen Ngô in Saigon . Cẩn was turned over to the military junta , which tried and executed him in 1964 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Cẩn was the fifth of six sons born to Ngô Đình Khả , who was a mandarin in the imperial court of Emperor Thành Thái , who was ruling under French control . 
 Khả retired from the court in protest at French interference , taking up farming . Cẩn 's first and third brothers — Ngô Đình Khôi and Diệm — rose to become provincial governors under French rule . Diệm , like his father , resigned in protest in 1933 , while Khôi was assassinated in 1945 by Hồ Chí Minh 's cadres . The second brother , Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục , was appointed as the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế . A fourth brother Ngô Đình Nhu became the family 's chief political strategist , while the youngest , Ngô Đình <unk> was a diplomat when the family held power in South Vietnam . Of the Ngô brothers , only Thục and <unk> avoided being executed or assassinated during Vietnam 's political upheavals . 
 Details about Cẩn 's early life are scarce . In his youth , he had studied the writings and opinions of the renowned anti @-@ French Vietnamese nationalist Phan Bội Châu , who spent his last years in Huế . Regarded as the leading revolutionary of his time , Châu had been captured and sentenced to death , before having his sentence reduced to house arrest . Cẩn regularly traveled to Châu 's sampan on the Perfume River with gifts of food and listened to Châu 's political lectures . Regarded as the least educated of his family , Cẩn had never traveled outside Vietnam and was the only Ngô brother not to have studied at a European @-@ run institution . 
 Vietnam was in chaos after the Japanese invaded the country during World War II and displaced the French colonial administration . At the end of the war , the Japanese left the country and France , severely weakened by political turmoil within the Vichy regime , was unable to exert control . Hồ Chí Minh 's Viet Minh declared independence as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and battled other Vietnamese nationalist groups as well as French forces for control of the nation . During this time , Cẩn organised a clandestine support base for Diệm in central Vietnam . At the time , Diệm was one of many nationalists who were attempting to stake a claim to national leadership , having spent a decade in self @-@ imposed exile from public affairs . Cẩn helped weaken other anti @-@ communist nationalist groups , such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng ( Vietnamese Nationalist Party ) and the Đại Việt Quốc Dân Đảng ( Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam ) , which competed with Diệm for support . On 23 October 1955 , Diệm toppled Bảo Đại in a fraud @-@ ridden referendum orchestrated by Nhu . Diệm declared himself President of the newly proclaimed Republic of Vietnam three days later . 
 Cẩn 's men helped to cow the populace into voting for his brother . Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten , with pepper sauce and water often forced down their nostrils . The violations were particularly flagrant in Cẩn 's area , which was the home of the Nguyễn Dynasty and a source of sympathy towards Bảo Đại . Cẩn ordered the police to arrest 1 @,@ 200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote . In Hội An , some people were killed in election day violence . 
 = = Rule = = 
 With Diệm 's ascent to the leadership of South Vietnam in 1955 , Cẩn 's stock rose . Cẩn had no formal position in the government but was effectively regarded as the warlord of central Vietnam . He had almost unlimited power in the region , often interfering with army operations against the Việt Cộng in a style described as " feudal " . Robert <unk> , a journalist and academic from the Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group , asserted that Cẩn , along with Nhu , Madame Nhu and eldest brother Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục formed " an extralegal elite which , with Diệm , directs the destiny of Vietnam " . Cẩn sometimes vetoed government @-@ appointed officials posted to central Vietnam from Saigon . 
 Cẩn ran his own personal army and secret police , which fought the Việt Cộng and imprisoned other anti @-@ communist political opponents . Cẩn accumulated great wealth through corrupt practices such as graft in awarding foreign aid contracts from the United States governments of Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy to Vietnamese businessmen . He required the businessmen to pay a fee to the National Revolutionary Movement – the official party of the regime – in return for the processing of applications for foreign aid contracts and import licenses . Cẩn was believed to be organising the trafficking of opium throughout Asia via Laos , and monopolising the cinnamon trade . 
 He was often in conflict with his brothers regarding internal matters , with Nhu , Diệm 's most influential adviser , controlling the southern part of the country . The brothers often competed with each other for U.S. aid contracts and the rice trade , but did not interfere with matters in one another 's territorial zone . Cẩn had once tried to set up an office for his secret police in Saigon ( which was in Nhu 's southern region ) by showing Diệm his long list of detained political opponents , but insisted that he not have to report to Nhu . Referring to his autocratic style , a Vietnamese critic said that unlike Diệm , Cẩn was consistent and left his followers in no doubt as to what he wanted : " They are not confused by double talk about democratic ideals and institutions " . His creation of a well @-@ defined system of incentives and deterrence has been cited as one reason for his success . 
 = = Anti @-@ communism = = 
 In spite of his autocracy and iron rule , Cẩn earned praise from Huế @-@ based US officials for his relatively high levels of success against the Việt Cộng insurgency . Cẩn 's central region was much more peaceful than the restive areas near Saigon and the Mekong Delta . Cẩn created the Popular Force organisation to operate in central Vietnam . The Popular Force was an alternative to the Strategic Hamlet Program which was used on a much larger scale in the south by Nhu , who moved peasants into fortified camps in an attempt to isolate Vietcong cadres from accessing the rural populace and intimidating or otherwise gaining their support . Cẩn assumed a third or so of the rural peasantry were Việt Cộng sympathisers , significant enough to render the hamlets ineffective by intimidating other villagers from within . Cẩn 's Popular Force were a group of volunteers who underwent rigorous training similar to United States Marine Corps Recruit Training . Those who passed the training were put into units of 150 men and assigned to live and work in the villages by day . At night , they did defense patrols , using hit @-@ and @-@ run tactics against the Việt Cộng . According to the report by US officials in central Vietnam , the program aroused popular support because of the integration of the Popular Force 's personnel into the daily life of the village and the sense of security that the force provided . The units were generally regarded as being successful in their six @-@ month deployments , allowing them to be deployed to the next trouble spot . Officials in Washington disagreed with the assessment of their subordinates in central Vietnam , alleging that Cẩn was mainly using the Popular Force for repressing dissidents . 
 = = Buddhist crisis = = 
 Cẩn was considered the most secular of the four Ngô brothers who controlled Vietnam 's domestic affairs . With the appointment of elder brother Thục as the Archbishop of Huế in 1961 , Cẩn became less influential as Thục aggressively blurred the distinction between church and state . In early 1963 , Nhu sent an emissary from Saigon telling Cẩn to retire and leave for Japan . Unrest erupted in the summer of 1963 . After the flying of Vatican flags was permitted at a celebration for the anniversary of Thục 's consecration as a bishop , the flying of Buddhist flags on 8 May to commemorate Vesak — the birth of Gautama Buddha — was banned . Cẩn 's subordinates ordered government forces to fire on the unarmed Buddhist crowd protesting the ban , killing nine . Cẩn believed the United States , whose relations with South Vietnam had become strained , caused an explosion during the Vesak shootings , to destabilise his family 's regime . 
 = = Downfall and arrest = = 
 Sparked by the killings in Huế on Vesak , the Buddhists organised nationwide mass protests against the religious bias of the Diệm regime throughout the summer of 1963 , demanding religious equality . The protests were met with brutal crackdowns , including ARVN Special Forces attacks on Buddhist pagodas which left hundreds missing , presumed dead . As public discontent heightened , a group of ARVN officers planned and carried out a US @-@ backed coup in November . This came about after Cẩn 's protégé Tôn Thất Đính , a 37 @-@ year @-@ old who became the youngest ever general in the ARVN due to his loyalty to the Diệm regime , switched sides and helped the coup when his corps was expected to remain loyal . Diệm and Nhu were executed at the conclusion of the coup . 
 Following the downfall of the Ngô family , the White House came under pressure from the South Vietnamese public to take a hard line against Cẩn . Mass graves containing 200 bodies were found on his land . The US consul in Huế , John Helble , confirmed the existence of rows of 18th @-@ century style dungeons with filthy , dark cells in an old French arsenal . Although junta member General Trần Văn Đôn asserted that the compound predated the Diệm era , the town 's citizens saw Cẩn as a mass murderer . On 4 November , two days after the coup ended , thousands of irate townspeople walked three kilometres to Cẩn 's house on the city 's southern outskirts — where he lived with his aged mother — demanding vengeance . The junta had ringed the home with barbed wire and armoured cars , sensing that the populace would riot and attack Cẩn . By this time , Cẩn had escaped to a Catholic seminary , but was considering applying to the Americans for political asylum . The U.S. State Department was faced with a dilemma : sheltering Cẩn would associate them with the protection of a corrupt and authoritarian regime that had killed and tortured hundreds of thousands of its own people . Allowing Cẩn to be attacked by angry mobs would damage the reputation of the new American @-@ backed junta . The State Department instructed : 
 asylum should be granted to Ngô Đình Cẩn if he is in physical danger from any source . If asylum granted explain to Huế authorities further violence would harm international reputation new regime . Also recall to them that U.S. took similar action to protect Thích Trí Quang from the Diệm government and can do no less in Can case . 
 The White House sent a cable to the US Embassy , Saigon on November 4 agreeing that Cẩn and his mother needed evacuation . General <unk> Cao Trí , the commander of the ARVN I Corps , who had repressed the Buddhists in Huế , privately told Cẩn that the junta would allow him safe passage out of Vietnam . On 5 November , Cẩn sought refuge at the US consulate with a suitcase crammed with US currency . Trí was then told that Cẩn was not safe in Huế and that he was to send Cẩn to Saigon , immediately for his own protection . Trí would only promise safe passage in an American plane to Saigon , where embassy officials would meet Cẩn . On the journey to the capital , Cẩn was accompanied by four Americans : a vice @-@ consul , two military policemen and a lieutenant colonel . He had intended to seek asylum in Japan . 
 U.S. ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr. had other ideas . Instead of sending embassy officials to Tân Sơn Nhứt airport , Lodge sent CIA agent Lucien Conein , who had helped the Vietnamese generals to plan the coup . Conein turned Cẩn over to the junta . Lodge said that General Đôn had promised that Cẩn would be dealt with " legally and judicially " . The ambassador told Washington that asylum was unnecessary , saying " It seems to me that our reason for giving him asylum therefore no longer exists " . He said that the U.S. could not interfere with justice , since Cẩn was " undoubtedly a reprehensible figure who deserves all the loathing which he now receives " . Lodge reasoned that since Cẩn would not be killed , protecting him would give the impression that the U.S. backed his activities . Lodge said that General Dương Văn Minh , who was the President , implied that Cẩn would receive clemency even if sentenced to death . This contradicted Conein 's assertion that the ARVN officer corps felt that Cẩn should be executed . Cẩn 's case was damaged by the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners , who recounted tales of torture at the hands of the Ngô brothers . 
 = = Trial and execution = = 
 It was reported that General Nguyễn Khánh — who had deposed Minh in a January 1964 coup — offered Cẩn exile if he handed over his foreign bank deposits . Cẩn protested , saying that he had no money . Đôn later claimed that Khánh would have executed Cẩn anyway , as Cẩn would have known of the corruption that the generals were party to . During the Ngô era , Khánh commanded the ARVN II Corps , which had operated in the Central Highlands under Cẩn 's supervision . Despite having helped to arrest Cẩn , Lodge advised Khánh to be restrained in his handling of the case for fear of stoking religious resentment or upsetting international opinion with a death penalty . 
 Lodge later claimed the South Vietnamese prosecutors failed to make any case against Cẩn . The Vietnamese leader also had to contend with the other side of the arguments , from those who considered themselves to be victims of the Diệm regime . During the trial , Thích Trí Quang , along with other opponents of the old regime , lobbied for a death sentence for Cẩn . He argued that if Cẩn lived , he could regain power along with his late brothers ' supporters . He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence , then the Vietnamese Buddhist community 's opinion of Washington would fall . Lodge was initially critical of Quang 's campaigning against Cẩn . Cẩn was sentenced to death . He appealed to the head of state for clemency ; his lawyers used a provision in the legal code to make the appeal . This placed Minh — who was still the titular head of state — in the position of approving a third death in the Ngô family , having already ordered his bodyguard Nguyễn Văn Nhung to execute Diệm and Nhu during the coup . 
 Cẩn 's diabetes worsened during the course of the trial , and by the time he was executed , his elderly mother had died . He suffered a heart attack while in custody . On 9 May 1964 , was carried on a stretcher into the prison courtyard and assisted by guards and two Catholic priests to stand alongside the post to which he was tied . He was blindfolded against his request and shot in front of approximately 200 spectators . Lodge defended his actions , claiming the United States did all it could to prevent the execution . The ambassador claimed Cẩn would have been allowed to seek refuge at the U.S. embassy , despite the fact that he had ordered Conein to intercept Cẩn at the airport . Rev. Cao Văn Luân , Catholic rector of Huế University who had been fired for falling afoul of the powerful Archbishop Thục , asked Lodge that Cẩn not be executed . According to Luân , Lodge reportedly assured the rector the execution would not take place . Cẩn left his personal fortune , which had indeed been deposited in foreign banks , to Catholic charities . 
 = New Forest pony = 
 The New Forest pony is one of the recognised mountain and moorland or native pony breeds of the British Isles . Height varies from around 12 to 14 @.@ 2 hands ( 48 to 58 inches , 122 to 147 cm ) ; ponies of all heights should be strong , workmanlike , and of a good riding type . They are valued for hardiness , strength , and sure @-@ footedness . 
 The breed is indigenous to the New Forest in Hampshire in southern England , where equines have lived since before the last Ice Age ; remains dating back to 500 @,@ 000 BC have been found within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of the heart of the modern New Forest . DNA studies have shown ancient shared ancestry with the Celtic @-@ type Asturcón and <unk> ponies . Many breeds have contributed to the foundation bloodstock of the New Forest pony , but today only ponies whose parents are both registered as purebred in the approved section of the stud book may be registered as purebred . The New Forest pony can be ridden by children and adults , can be driven in harness , and competes successfully against larger horses in horse show competition . 
 All ponies grazing on the New Forest are owned by New Forest commoners – people who have " rights of common of pasture " over the Forest lands . An annual marking fee is paid for each animal turned out to graze . The population of ponies on the Forest has fluctuated in response to varying demand for young stock . Numbers fell to fewer than six hundred in 1945 , but have since risen steadily , and thousands now run loose in semi @-@ feral conditions . The welfare of ponies grazing on the Forest is monitored by five Agisters , employees of the Verderers of the New Forest . Each Agister takes responsibility for a different area of the Forest . The ponies are gathered annually in a series of drifts , to be checked for health , wormed , and they are tail @-@ marked ; each pony 's tail is trimmed to the pattern of the Agister responsible for that pony . Purebred New Forest stallions approved by the Breed Society and by the New Forest Verderers run out on the Forest with the mares for a short period each year . Many of the foals bred on the Forest are sold through the Beaulieu Road pony sales , which are held several times each year . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Standards for the breed are stipulated by the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society . The maximum height allowed is 14 @.@ 2 1 ⁄ 4 hands ( 58 @.@ 25 inches , 148 cm ) . Although there is no minimum height standard , in practice New Forest ponies are seldom less than 12 hands ( 48 inches , 122 cm ) . In shows , they normally are classed in two sections : competition height A , 138 centimetres ( 54 in ) and under ; and competition height B , over 138 centimetres ( 54 in ) . New Forest ponies should be of riding type , workmanlike , and strong in conformation , with a sloping shoulder and powerful hindquarters ; the body should be deep , and the legs straight with strong , flat bone , and hard , rounded hooves . Larger ponies , although narrow enough in the barrel for small children to ride comfortably , are also capable of carrying adults . Smaller ponies may not be suitable for heavier riders , but they often have more show quality . The New Forest pony has free , even gaits , active and straight , but not exaggerated , and is noted for sure @-@ footedness , agility , and speed . 
 The ponies are most commonly bay , chestnut , or grey . Few coat colours are excluded : piebald , skewbald , and blue @-@ eyed cream are not allowed ; palomino and very light chestnut are only accepted by the stud book as geldings and mares . Blue eyes are never accepted . White markings on the head and lower legs are allowed , unless they appear behind the head , above the point of the hock in the hind leg , or above the metacarpal bone at the bend in the knee in the foreleg . Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book , but are recorded in the appendix , known as the X @-@ register . The offspring of these animals may not be registered as purebred New Forest ponies , as the stud book is closed and only the offspring of purebred @-@ approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred . 
 New Forest ponies have a gentle temperament and a reputation for intelligence , strength , and versatility . On the whole , they are a sturdy and hardy breed . The one known hereditary genetic disorder found in the breed is congenital <unk> , a muscular condition also found in humans , dogs , cats , and goats . It was identified in the Netherlands in 2009 , after a clinically affected foal was presented to the Equine Clinic of Utrecht University . DNA sequencing revealed that the affected foal was homozygous for a missense mutation in the gene encoding <unk> , a protein which regulates the excitability of the skeletal muscle . The mutated allele was found in both the foal 's parents , its siblings , and two other related animals , none of whom exhibited any clinical signs . The researchers concluded that the condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance , whereby both parents have to contribute the mutated allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype . The study suggested that the mutation was of relatively recent origin : the founder of the mutated gene , as all the ponies who tested positive for the mutation are direct descendants of this stallion . The probable founder stallion has been identified as <unk> 's Ronaldo ; testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry the mutated gene . All carriers will be removed from the breeding section of the New Forest Pony Breeding & Cattle Society 's stud book , and all New Forest stallions licensed in the UK also will be tested , whether or not they descend from <unk> 's Ronaldo , to cover the possibility that the mutated gene may have appeared earlier in the pedigree , although it is believed that the mutated gene has now been eradicated from the British breeding stock . All breeding stock imported to the UK also will be tested . 
 = = History = = 
 Ponies have grazed in the area of the New Forest for many thousands of years , predating the last Ice Age . Spear damage on a horse shoulder bone discovered at Eartham Pit , Boxgrove ( about 50 miles ( 80 km ) from the heart of the modern New Forest ) , dated 500 @,@ 000 BC , demonstrates that early humans were hunting horses in the area at that time , and the remains of a large Ice Age hunting camp have been found close to Ringwood ( on the western border of the modern New Forest ) . Evidence from the skeletal remains of ponies from the Bronze Age suggests that they resembled the modern Exmoor pony . Horse bones excavated from Iron Age ritual burial sites at Danebury ( about 25 miles ( 40 km ) from the heart of the modern New Forest ) , indicate that the animals were approximately 12 hands ( 48 inches , 122 cm ) – a height similar to that of some of the smaller New Forest ponies of today . 
 William the Conqueror , who claimed the New Forest as a royal hunting ground , shipped more than two thousand horses across the English Channel when he invaded England in 1066 . The earliest written record of horses in the New Forest dates back to that time , when rights of common of pasture were granted to the area 's inhabitants . A popular tradition linking the ancestry of the New Forest pony to Spanish horses said to have swum ashore from wrecked ships at the time of the Spanish Armada has , according to the New Forest National Park Authority , " long been accepted as a myth " , however , the offspring of Forest mares , probably bred at the Royal Stud in Lyndhurst , were exported in 1507 for use in the Renaissance wars . A genetic study in 1998 suggested that the New Forest pony has ancient shared ancestry with two endangered Spanish Celtic @-@ type pony breeds , the Asturcón and <unk> . 
 The most notable stallion in the early history of the breed was a Thoroughbred named Marske , the sire of Eclipse , and a great @-@ grandson of the Darley Arabian . Marske was sold to a Ringwood farmer for 20 guineas on the death of Prince William , Duke of Cumberland , and was used to breed with " country mares " in the 1760s . 
 In the 1850s and 1860s , the quality of the ponies was noted to be declining , a result of poor choice of breeding stallions , and the introduction of Arab to improve the breed was recommended . The census of stock of 1875 reported just under three thousand ponies grazing the Forest , and by 1884 the number had dropped to 2 @,@ 250 . Profits from the sale of young ponies affected the number of mares that commoners bred in subsequent years . The drop in numbers on the Forest may have been a consequence of introducing Arab blood to the breed in the 1870s , resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies , or to the increase in the profits from running dairy cattle instead of ponies . The Arab blood may have reduced the ponies ' natural landrace hardiness to thrive on the open Forest over winter . Numbers of ponies on the Forest also declined as a result of demand for more refined @-@ looking ponies for riding and driving work prior to the introduction of motor vehicles . Later , the Second World War drove up the demand for , and thus , the market value of , young animals for horse meat . 
 Founded in 1891 , the Society for the improvement of New Forest Ponies organised a stallion show and offered financial incentives to encourage owners of good stallions to run them on the Forest . In 1905 the Burley and District NF Pony Breeding and Cattle Society was set up to start the stud book and organise the Breed Show ; the two societies merged in 1937 to form the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society . Overall numbers of livestock grazing the Forest , including ponies , tended to decline in the early twentieth century ; in 1945 there were just 571 ponies <unk> . By 1956 the number of ponies of all breeds on the Forest had more than doubled to 1 @,@ 341 . Twenty years later pony numbers were up to 3 @,@ 589 , rising to 4 @,@ 112 in 1994 , before dipping back below four thousand until 2005 . As of 2011 , there were 4 @,@ 604 ponies grazing on the New Forest . 
 In 2014 , the Rare Breeds Survival Trust ( <unk> ) conservation charity watch @-@ listed the New Forest pony in its " minority breed " category , given the presence of less than 3 @,@ 000 breeding females in the forest . Over the course of five years , the number of foals born each year had dropped by two @-@ thirds ( from 1 @,@ 563 to just 423 in 2013 ) – a change attributed by The New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society to a declining market , and by the New Forest Verderers to steps that had been taken to improve the quality rather than the quantity of foals . 
 For a variety of reasons , including normal trade in the area and attempts to improve the breed , Arabian , Thoroughbred , Welsh pony , and Hackney blood had been added to ponies in the New Forest . Over time , however , the better @-@ quality ponies were sold off , leaving the poorer @-@ quality and less hardy animals as the Forest breeding stock . To address this situation , as well as to increase the stock 's hardiness and restore native type , in the early twentieth century animals from other British native mountain and moorland pony breeds such as the Fell , Dales , Highland , Dartmoor , and Exmoor were introduced to the Forest . This practice ended in 1930 , and since that time , only purebred New Forest stallions may be turned out . The New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society has been publishing the stud book since 1960 . New Forest ponies have been exported to many parts of the world , including Canada , the U.S. , Europe , and Australia , and many countries now have their own breed societies and stud books . 
 = = Uses = = 
 In the past , smaller ponies were used as pit ponies . Today the New Forest pony and related crossbreeds are still the " working pony of choice " for local farmers and commoners , as their sure @-@ footedness , agility , and sound sense will carry them ( and their rider ) safely across the varied and occasionally hazardous terrain of the open Forest , sometimes at great speed , during the autumn drifts . New Forest ponies also are used today for <unk> , show jumping , cross @-@ country , dressage , driving , and eventing . 
 The ponies can carry adults and in many cases compete on equal terms with larger equines while doing so . For example , in 2010 , the New Forest Pony Enthusiasts Club ( <unk> ) , a registered riding club whose members compete only on purebred registered New Forest ponies , won the Quadrille competition at the London International Horse Show at Olympia . This was a significant win , as the British Riding Clubs Quadrille is a national competition , with only four teams from the whole of Britain selected to compete at the National Final . 
 = = Ponies on the New Forest = = 
 The ponies grazing the New Forest are considered to be iconic . They , together with the cattle , donkeys , pigs , and sheep owned by commoners ' ( local people with common grazing rights ) , are called " the architects of the Forest " : it is the grazing and browsing of the commoners ' animals over a thousand years which created the New Forest ecosystem as it is today . 
 The cattle and ponies living on the New Forest are not completely feral , but are owned by commoners , who pay an annual fee for each animal turned out . The animals are looked after by their owners and by the Agisters employed by the Verderers of the New Forest . The Verderers are a statutory body with ancient roots , who share management of the forest with the Forestry Commission and National park authority . Approximately 80 per cent of the animals <unk> on the New Forest are owned by just 10 per cent of the <unk> families . 
 Ponies living full @-@ time on the New Forest are almost all mares , although there are also a few geldings . For much of the year the ponies live in small groups , usually consisting of an older mare , her daughters , and their foals , all keeping to a discrete area of the Forest called a " haunt . " Under New Forest regulations , mares and geldings may be of any breed . Although the ponies are predominantly New Foresters , other breeds such as Shetlands and their crossbred descendants may be found in some areas . 
 Stallions must be registered New Foresters , and are not allowed to run free all year round on the Forest . They normally are turned out only for a limited period in the spring and summer , when they gather several groups of mares and <unk> into larger herds and defend them against other stallions . A small number ( usually fewer than 50 ) are turned out , generally between May and August . This ensures that foals are born neither too early ( before the spring grass is coming through ) , nor too late ( as the colder weather is setting in and the grazing and browsing on the Forest is dying back ) in the following year . 
 Colts are assessed in their two @-@ year @-@ old year by the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society for suitability to be kept as stallions ; any animal failing the assessment must be gelded . Once approved , every spring ( usually in March ) , the stallions must pass the Verderers ' assessment before they are permitted onto the Forest to breed . The stallion scheme resulted in a reduction of genetic diversity in the ponies running out on the New Forest , and to counteract this and preserve the hardiness of Forest @-@ run ponies , the Verderers introduced the Bloodline Diversity Project , which will use hardy Forest @-@ run mares , mostly over eleven years old , bred to stallions that have not been run out on the Forest , or closely related to those that have . 
 Drifts to gather the animals are carried out in autumn . Most colts and some fillies are removed , along with any animals considered too " poor " to remain on the Forest over the winter . The remaining fillies are branded with their owner 's mark , and many animals are wormed . Many owners choose to remove a number of animals from the Forest for the winter , turning them out again the following spring . Animals surplus to their owner 's requirements often are sold at the Beaulieu Road Pony Sales , run by the New Forest Livestock Society . Tail hair of the ponies is trimmed , and cut into a recognisable pattern to show that the pony 's grazing fees have been paid for the year . Each Agister has his own " tail @-@ mark " , indicating the area of the Forest where the owner lives . The Agisters keep a constant watch over the condition of the Forest @-@ running stock , and an animal may be " ordered off " the Forest at any time . The rest of the year , the lives of the ponies are relatively unhindered unless they need veterinary attention or additional feeding , when they are usually taken off the Forest . 
 The open nature of the New Forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads . The ponies actually have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars in an effort to reduce traffic fatalities , but despite this , many ponies , along with commoners ' cattle , pigs , and donkeys are killed or injured in road traffic accidents every year . Human interaction with ponies is also a problem ; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them , which can create dietary problems and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food . 
 New Forest ponies are raced in an annual point to point meeting in the Forest , usually on Boxing Day , finishing at a different place each year . The races do not have a fixed course , but instead are run across the open Forest , so competitors choose their own routes around obstructions such as inclosures ( forestry plantations ) , fenced paddocks , and bogs . Riders with a detailed knowledge of the Forest are thus at an advantage . The location of the meeting place is given to competitors on the previous evening , and the starting point of the race is revealed once riders have arrived at the meeting point . 
 = Argument from morality = 
 The argument from morality is an argument for the existence of God . Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order . Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this , concluding that God must exist . Argument from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe . They claim that , for this moral order to exist , God must exist to support it . The argument from morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in metaethics . 
 German philosopher Immanuel Kant devised an argument from morality based on practical reason . Kant argued that the goal of humanity is to achieve perfect happiness and virtue ( the summum bonum ) and believed that an afterlife must exist in order for this to be possible , and that God must exist to provide this . In his book Mere Christianity , C. S. Lewis argued that " conscience reveals to us a moral law whose source cannot be found in the natural world , thus pointing to a supernatural Lawgiver . " Lewis argued that accepting the validity of human reason as a given must include accepting the validity of practical reason , which could not be valid without reference to a higher cosmic moral order which could not exist without a God to create and / or establish it . A related argument is from conscience ; John Henry Newman argued that the conscience supports the claim that objective moral truths exist because it drives people to act morally even when it is not in their own interest . Newman argued that , because the conscience suggests the existence of objective moral truths , God must exist to give authority to these truths . 
 = = General form = = 
 All variations of the argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God . Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience , arguing that God is the best explanation for these . Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain , only possible if God exists . 
 Many arguments from morality are based on moral normativity , which suggests that objective moral truths exist and require God 's existence to give them authority . Often , they consider that morality seems to be binding – obligations are seen to convey more than just a preference , but imply that the obligation will stand , regardless of other factors or interests . For morality to be binding , God must exist . In its most general form , the argument from moral normativity is : 
 A human experience of morality is observed . 
 God is the best or only explanation for this moral experience . 
 Therefore , God exists . 
 Some arguments from moral order suggest that morality is based on rationality and that this can only be the case if there is a moral order in the universe . The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe , so God must exist . Alternative arguments from moral order have proposed that we have an obligation to attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue . They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible , and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists . A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived , so God must exist . 
 = = Variations = = 
 = = = Practical Reason = = = 
 In his Critique of Pure Reason , German philosopher Immanuel Kant stated that no successful argument for God 's existence arises from reason alone . In his Critique of Practical Reason he went on to argue that , despite the failure of these arguments , morality requires that God 's existence is assumed , owing to practical reason . Rather than proving the existence of God , Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists . Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum : the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness , where happiness arises out of virtue . As ought implies can , Kant argued , it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved . He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about , because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness , so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness . 
 Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes a common objection to Kant 's argument : that what ought to be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible . He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum . Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable , such as the Biblical command to be Christ @-@ like . He proposes that Kant 's first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good , not that it is actually attainable . 
 = = = Argument from objective moral truths = = = 
 Both theists and non @-@ theists have accepted that the existence of objective moral truths might entail the existence of God . Atheist philosopher J. L. Mackie accepted that , if objective moral truths existed , they would warrant a supernatural explanation . Scottish philosopher W. R. Sorley presented the following argument : 
 If morality is objective and absolute , God must exist . 
 Morality is objective and absolute . 
 Therefore , God must exist . 
 Many critics have challenged the second premise of this argument , by offering a biological and sociological account of the development of human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute . This account , supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse , proposes that the human experience of morality is a by @-@ product of natural selection , a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism . According to the theory , the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures , which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development ; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind . Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce . No human society today advocates immorality , such as theft or murder , because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring . Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument , that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless . 
 Because evolutionary naturalism proposes an empirical account of morality , it does not require morality to exist objectively ; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or <unk> . C. S. Lewis argued that , if evolutionary naturalism is accepted , human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong . Despite this , Lewis argued , those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist , leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent . As an alternative ethical theory , Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality , thus asserting God 's existence . 
 <unk> Gaskin challenges the first premise of the argument from moral objectivity , arguing that it must be shown why absolute and objective morality entails that morality is commanded by God , rather than simply a human invention . It could be the consent of humanity that gives it moral force , for example . American philosopher Michael Martin argues that it is not necessarily true that objective moral truths must entail the existence of God , suggesting that there could be alternative explanations : he argues that naturalism may be an acceptable explanation and , even if a supernatural explanation is necessary , it does not have to be God ( polytheism is a viable alternative ) . Martin also argues that a non @-@ objective account of ethics might be acceptable and challenges the view that a subjective account of morality would lead to moral anarchy . 
 = = = Conscience = = = 
 Related to the argument from morality is the argument from conscience , associated with eighteenth @-@ century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth @-@ century cardinal John Henry Newman . Newman proposed that the conscience , as well as giving moral guidance , provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine . He argued that <unk> is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally , even when it might be in their interests . Newman proposed that , to explain the conscience , God must exist . 
 British philosopher John Locke argued that moral rules cannot be established from conscience because the differences in people 's consciences would lead to contradictions . Locke also noted that the conscience is influenced by " education , company , and customs of the country " , a criticism mounted by J. L. Mackie , who argued that the conscience should be seen as an " introjection " of other people into an agent 's mind . Michael Martin challenges the argument from conscience with a naturalistic account of conscience , arguing that naturalism provides an adequate explanation for the conscience without the need for God 's existence . He uses the example of the <unk> by humans of social pressures , which leads to the fear of going against these norms . Even if a supernatural cause is required , he argues , it could be something other than God ; this would mean that the phenomenon of the conscience is no more supportive of monotheism than polytheism .

 " A Milhouse Divided " is the sixth episode of The Simpsons eighth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 1 , 1996 . In the episode , Milhouse 's parents Kirk and Luann get a divorce , causing Homer to examine his own marriage . It was directed by Steven Dean Moore and is the only episode for which Steve Tompkins has sole writing credit . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Marge throws a dinner party to escape from the doldrums at the Simpson house , so she decides to invite the Flanders , the Lovejoys , the <unk> and the Van Houtens . All the guests are enjoying dinner except for the Van Houtens who argue with each other as Milhouse plays in another room with Bart and the children . Kirk and Luann get more quarrelsome as the party progresses and finally , despite Marge trying to divert the party away from the pair , the two get into a fight and Luann demands a divorce . 
 Kirk moves out of the Van Houten house and , despite his drab new surroundings , manages to keep a cheery attitude toward it all until he is fired from his job at the cracker factory as " crackers are a family food ... happy families " and Kirk , being single , is apparently unfit for the position . Meanwhile , Luann quickly <unk> to single life with Milhouse and starts a new relationship with an American Gladiator . Kirk also tries to have a new relationship with a sleazy radio station worker , but ends up getting his car stolen and his demo tape wrecked . While at Moe 's , Kirk mentions that he never saw the divorce coming and regrets not being more sensitive to Luann 's needs , concluding that " one minute , your wife is cooking you your favorite meal ; the next , you 're thawing hot dogs in a gas station sink . " Homer cheers Kirk up by telling him that his marriage to Marge is solid , but Homer begins to fear that his marriage may end in divorce after coming home and finding hot dogs thawing in the sink . 
 Homer enlists the aid of Lisa to help him figure out how to save his marriage , but Lisa tells Homer that he is lucky to have Marge . He recalls his wedding reception , which was nothing more than Homer and Marge eating a whale cake at a roadside truck stop . Homer tries to perform selfless gestures for Marge , such as making soothing ocean noises to lull her to sleep and cutting her hair , but they only serve to annoy her . 
 Deciding at that point that Marge deserves a fresh start , Homer secretly files for a divorce . As Marge returns home later that night , Homer surprises her by hiding all their friends in the living room and declares that he wants to be remarried , this time with a perfect wedding . The two are remarried ( though in Season 20 it is revealed that the marriage in this episode was invalid as Reverend Lovejoy was uncertified at this time due to a clerical error , meaning Homer and Marge were still divorced ) . Meanwhile , Kirk decides to try to get back together with Luann by singing " Can I Borrow a Feeling " , the song he recorded on a demo tape . However , the attempt fails ; Luann refuses to take Kirk back and Kirk is sent out of the Simpsons house .

 " A Milhouse Divided " is the only episode for which Steve Tompkins has sole writing credit , although he had been a part of the writing staff for several years . The writers wanted to do an episode that involved a couple getting divorced . They had wanted to break the sitcom convention that characters who look like they will divorce get back together and have two characters remain divorced even after the episode . The Van Houtens were chosen because the writers felt that they were the most developed couple next to Marge and Homer and the Lovejoys . The scene in the episode " Sideshow Bob 's Last Gleaming " where Milhouse is in a jet pretending to fire missiles at his parents is where they got the idea to have his parents ' marriage be in trouble . 
 Originally , the episode also focused on the divorce 's effects on Milhouse and there was a subplot that involved Bart being jealous of Milhouse and wishing that Marge and Homer would also separate . Several scenes were written and animated for the episode , but ultimately they were cut because the script was very long . The third act of the episode shifts the focus from the Van Houtens to Homer and Marge because the writers felt that tertiary characters could not carry an audience 's interest for an entire episode . Bill Oakley has said that he felt that the episode would have failed had they stuck with the Van Houtens for the third act and most of the other writers also felt that it was the right move . 
 The idea for the dinner party came from Bill Oakley , who had wanted to have a party similar to the one in " The War of the Simpsons " . For the second half of the episode , Luann was redesigned to look more youthful and was given a new outfit . A big name singer was originally sought to sing " Can I Borrow a Feeling ? " over the end credits . The writers wanted Sheryl Crow , but she declined and the concept was later dropped .

It was the fourth @-@ highest @-@ rated show from the Fox Network that week . 
 Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , called it " More drama than comedy , and very honest in its dealings with the Van Houtens ' divorce and its effects on Milhouse . "

The song features additional vocals by soul singer Dwele and is co @-@ produced by West and Symbolyc One . It is built around samples of " 21st Century Schizoid Man " by King Crimson , " Afromerica " by Continent Number 6 , and " It 's Your Thing " by Cold Grits . After having recorded it in Hawaii , West reported that he spent 5000 hours composing " Power " . In its lyrics , West comments about the United States and his critics . Its chorus features an abrasive vocal @-@ riff . 
 " POWER " was West 's comeback single following his 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak and his controversial incident with Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards . The song received acclaim from music critics and it was listed amongst the best tracks of 2010 by several publications , including Time , Pitchfork Media , Spin , and Rolling Stone .

 2009 was a troubled year for Kanye West , who had faced various controversies , including the divisive nature of his previous album , 808s & Heartbreak and his interruption of recording artist Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards during her acceptance speech . West explained that the motivation of some of his questionable decisions stemmed from over @-@ work . The ensuing media controversy caused West to exile himself in Oahu , Hawaii and record his fifth studio album mostly in a reclusive nature , shying away from collaborating with artists he wasn 't personally close to . While composing the album , West assembled a large staff of established producers including Pete Rock , the RZA and Q @-@ Tip , with West handling portions of the production himself . 
 Despite having several well @-@ known producers on his recording team , the majority of the production featured on " Power " was done by the lesser @-@ known Symbolyc One . The song was primarily produced by him and was initially intended to be given to rapper Rhymefest , until West listened to the song and expressed interest in using the beat himself . According to Symbolyc One , West was an admirer of the composition , and asked him to fly down to Hawaii , where he discovered that West had already recorded some of his version of the song . A month later , the producer was asked to return to Hawaii and discovered that the beat had been further modified by West , who added " polish " to the track . Symbolyc One expressed surprise that West was so interested in using the beat , since the song features drums reminiscent of a song from West 's Late Registration entitled " Crack Music " . 
 In an outtake from the 2012 documentary Something from Nothing : The Art of Rap directed by rapper Ice @-@ T , West mused that he had never actually written down his lyrics before , and that " Power " represented a turning point in his songwriting process : 
 “ I didn 't write my raps down for my first four albums — like at all , I did it from the head straight to the booth . But on this last album , My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy , I wrote it . I really put myself in the zone that my life was dependent on the success of this album . With that being the case , I said , ‘ You know what ? No matter what anybody says about me , they won ’ t — I can write something that can make someone that hates me the most have to really respect or love the song . ’ So even a song like ‘ Power , ’ I spent 5 @,@ 000 hours writing it , and it ’ s really the psychology behind the lyrics ; it ’ s not just blatantly , ‘ I ’ ve got all the power ’ — ‘ No one man should have all that power . ’ It ’ s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone . Even if I use first person and say ‘ I , I , I , ’ it ’ s always for everyone . " 
 West also declared influence from his previous singles " Stronger " and " Good Life " from his third album Graduation stating that the track was meant to be inspirational for the listener . According to West , he wanted his music to be appealing in an economy facing a recession . On June 30 , 2010 , the single was released on iTunes for digital download . The cover art work for " Power " was produced by American visual artist George Condo , who also designed the artwork for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy . The artwork depicts a decapitated bleeding head wearing a crown , pierced with a sword through it . The single had two other alternate cover designs , both produced by Condo . A second one was released featuring a depiction of West with a gaping , demented mouth . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Power " marked a stylistic return to hip hop for West after the sparse electro of 808s & Heartbreak . It has been described as surreal , frightening , dark , and strange in nature . The production of " Power " centers on samples of " 21st Century Schizoid Man " by English progressive rock band King Crimson , " Afromerica " by French disco act Continent Number 6 , and " It 's Your Thing " by American funk band Cold Grits . The song 's production is reinforced with a vocal harmony provided by Dwele , with a line delivery mostly inspired by braggadocio rapping methods . The song has been described as dark thematically and was called " apocalyptic " . According to Alex Denney of NME , the track is the first moment of catharsis on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy , stating that the track made use of " tribal fanfare and supercharged lyrics " . He mused that lines like “ I guess every superhero need his theme music ” appear to be West 's imagining of a warm welcome to heaven . Pitchfork Media 's Ryan Dombal described West 's delivery as urgent , summarizing the production ; 
 " More than ever , though , " Power " has Kanye internalizing his multiple minds and coming to an ecstatic peace with them . " Power " is not a <unk> . It 's an exaltation . All of his various <unk> King of the Assholes , drama queen , Red Bull 'd 12 @-@ year @-@ old , Next Chappelle , strangely relatable <unk> are mashed up in this proudly schizoid roll call . Every sound is ready for the arena , and every couplet is ready for the 140 character treatment , including this one : " I don 't need yo pussy , bitch , I 'm on my own dick / I ain 't gotta power trip , who you goin ' home with ? " He knows the answer , and so do we . " 
 The song takes several influences from previous projects by West and was called a summation of his prior styles . The song takes cues from the militant chants of West 's song " Jesus Walks " from his first album The College Dropout , the drum @-@ style of " Crack Music " from West 's Late Registration , the inspirational aspect of " Stronger " from Graduation and the atmospheric piano and strings featured on 808s & Heartbreak . The chorus is " simultaneously boastful , condemning , and anxious " , and anthemic in nature , featuring a wordless vocal chant . West utilizes a military @-@ inspired , " take @-@ no @-@ prisoner " approach on the song , purposely failing to be apologetic , even going as far as mocking some of his critics . Other topics discussed on the song include social commentary on the state of the United States , and his thoughts on race issues . 
 The lyrics of the song have been cited as " classic Kanye " , featuring many of the traits that have been exhibited in his lyricism in the past . Themes that have defined much of his work , such as egotism , cultural criticism , and personal issues , are featured prominently in the song . West self @-@ described the song as " superhero theme music " , with the track darting back from being depressing and bombastic in nature , with the sample occasionally cutting through the song in an abrasive manner . The track seemingly culminates with the suicide of its main character , ending with a menacing laugh provided by West .

 " Power " received rave reviews from music critics upon release , many calling it West 's best single in years . Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave a positive review to the song , describing it as West 's best single since " Stronger " , writing that West " rides a torrid <unk> beat , as he takes on his <unk> media image , <unk> from self @-@ aware ( ' I 'm an asshole ' ) to defiant ( ' Kiss my asshole ' ) . The sentiment is classic Kanye , but he hasn 't melted down this brilliantly in a long time . " Jason Lipshutz from Billboard praised the song , saying , " with its stunning mix of rock @-@ leaning production , memorable rhymes and unadulterated attitude , new single ' Power ' is a pissed @-@ off shot of adrenaline that plays upon all of the controversial rapper 's strengths . Rhyming over a soulful vocal harmony and an abrasive sample of King Crimson 's " 21st Century Schizoid Man , " West dismisses his doubters , takes a shot at Saturday Night Live and shrugs off his recent hiatus from hip @-@ hop . " Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media dubbed the track ' Best New Music ' in June 2010 , and viewed it as an adequate response to West 's self @-@ imposed exile and public scrutiny . 
 Talking about the album version of the song , David Amidon of PopMatters praised the new minor additions featured in the production , musing " from mere sonic details to a litany of background histrionics on guitar that play off of West ’ s delivery throughout " , and compared the production favorably to Late Registration . HipHopDX writer Jake Paine felt that one of the best moments of the album occurred early on , during " Power " and that track will likely be the most remembered song " in lyrical circles " . Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called the track a terrific single , declaring that it " soars to adrenaline @-@ fueled heights on the strength of urgent , stomping percussion @-@ driven , serpentine electric guitar , and a show @-@ stopping sample of King Crimson ’ s " 21st Century Schizoid Man " , stating that the song best showcases West 's vision on the album . BBC 's Stephen Kelly called the song " brilliantly pompous " . 
 Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot called the song exhilarating in nature , with a furious , layered , percussion beat , praising the song 's narrative about a man who " lost in translation with a whole … nation " . MT Richards of Slant Magazine stated that " Power " sounded nothing like any hip @-@ hop song of recent memory , going as far as saying that the single signified that West was on a " league of his own . " Richards largely praised , the song , musing that the " misanthropic ' Power ' will surely alienate those longing for another sunny hit like " Hey Mama " . At last , West has emerged steely @-@ eyed , bold , and out of his mind . " AbsolutePunk 's Drew Beringer stated that the track was a classic West song , with the track featuring a " brilliant sample of King Crimson " and infectious hand claps . 
 The song was also well received by former King Crimson member Greg Lake , the original lead vocalist and bassist on " 21st Century Schizoid Man . " When asked for his own stance on sampling during an interview with O2 Academy , Lake gave a positive response . He stated , " What I was pleased with was , is the relevance of ' 21st Century Schizoid Man ' today . ' You know , it still sounds current . It still sounds relevant . That ’ s really gratifying after all of these years . I mean , that record is what — 40 , 50 years old ? I don ’ t know , but very old . Old like me ! But it ’ s lovely to hear a really contemporary artist doing it . " In an interview with Rolling Stone , Lake further commented , " In a way , that song still sounds modern to me . I think when you hear Kanye West do it , or include it in his own song , it 's relevant . He 's speaking about that crazy world that we live in . It 's as true now as it was then . It 's an honor when something like that happens . " Due in part to West 's usage , " 21st Century Schizoid Man " has since became a favorite of Lake , who became known for opening each of his one @-@ man shows by performing the song during his 2012 Songs of a Lifetime theatre tour . Lake went into detail regarding a typical performance of " 21st Century Schizoid Man " at his concerts : 
 " It starts with the lights going out and everything is black . The first thing you hear is the Kanye West piece . When the hook comes on , " 21st Century Schizoid Man , " the spotlight comes on and there 's no one on the stage . Then the track carries , but the second time the hook comes , it 's me , and me singing it . And I open up with " Schizoid Man . " It 's a great shocker , but it 's a statement too . It 's enabled me to link the past with the present . "

 Pitchfork Media named the song the sixth best song of 2010 , with the staff writing " it 's all of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy 's pathology and genius in digest form , the vicarious , timeless thrill of hearing a crazy talented person act crazy and talented . " Rolling Stone placed the song at position 40 amongst their 50 best tracks of the year . The song was on a list of the 20 best songs of the year by Spin , with critic Charles Aaron musing that " as if he 's inciting an Afro @-@ futurist convocation , Kanye creates the theme music for his spectacularly ambivalent " superhero " alter ego . " MTV News declared the track the third best of the year , citing it as a definitive single from the album . Time also listed the song amongst the best 10 of its year . Complex magazine listed it as the sixth best of the year , commenting that with " all the great music Kanye released this year , you might have forgotten just how absolutely amazing ' Power ' was " . In January 2011 , The Village Voice 's Pazz & Jop annual critics ' poll named " Power " the fifth @-@ best song of 2010 to find the best music of that year ; West 's other singles " Runaway " and " Monster " were ranked at numbers four and six , respectively . Their parent album , My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was ranked the best album of 2010 on the same poll . 
 As " Power " was released before the Grammy cutoff date of August , it was the only work by West eligible for Grammy consideration that year , with the rest of the album eligible the following year . The track was nominated for Best Rap Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards , being West 's only Grammy nomination that year . It lost the award to " Not Afraid " by Eminem . Though the album , and its songs , later won three Grammys at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012 .

 In promotion of West 's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy , he launched GOOD Fridays , a weekly free music giveaway . The intention was to release a free new song every Friday for a few months to promote his album , and the weekly tracks generally featured various rappers from his label , GOOD Music , and other artists he usually collaborated with . A remix of " Power " was the very first GOOD Friday released , and in an interview with Hot 97 , West said that the remix was to feature his good friend and rapper Jay @-@ Z. It was originally intended to be released on August 13 , 2010 , but was premiered on August 20 , 2010 on Hot 97 by Funkmaster Flex . The song also features vocals and production from Swizz Beatz and all new verses provided by West . Swizz Beatz produced the second half of the song which samples Snap ! ' s hip house hit , " The Power . " The remix was described as more intricate than an average remix , with Jay @-@ Z discussing the ups and downs of life and referencing Norman Mailer .

 West debuted " Power " live at the 2010 BET Awards , where he performed the song atop a mountain @-@ like prop , with a video compilation of footage shot on top of a mountain playing in the back . West performed the track on Saturday Night Live on October 2 . The song contains the line " fuck SNL and the whole cast " , though that line was omitted during his performance , where West dropped it in favor of new lyrics . For the first time in the show 's history , the signature black instrument filled stage gave place to an all @-@ white , backlit canvas . 
 West 's performance was heavily publicized and received positive notices . HitFix 's Gregory Ellwood praised the performance , writing " note to Lorne Michaels : whatever West had to do to let you break form and come up with such a visually stunning and impressive performance was well , well worth it . This is memorable television . Hands down . " E ! Online 's Megan Masters mused that " West 's SNL performance proved once again that no matter what 's going on in his personal life , he is an artist and will continue to take chances in the music industry — ultimately breaking new ground , " adding that " Kanye West is a comeback king . " Kevin O 'Donnell of Spin wrote that West delivered one of the show 's " most unique performances of all @-@ time . " West performed the song in an entirely red outfit . 
 West also performed the track live at the <unk> 2010 , in Madrid , during Thirty Seconds to Mars 's performance of their song " Hurricane " , which also features a verse by West . The remixed version of the song were performed by West and Jay @-@ Z during their Watch the Throne Tour . The remixed version was performed at Jay @-@ Z 's and Eminem 's " Home & Home " concert in the new Yankee Stadium , during Jay @-@ Z portion of the performance . West joined Jay @-@ Z on stage and also performed single " Monster " . During his set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival , West performed " Power " during the start of the performance . West 's performance was described as " one of the most memorable performances in Coachella history . " Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone noted that " with its stomping beat and chanted chorus , ' Power ' – one of West 's most grandiose songs anyway – was an early highlight of his show . " 
 = = Music video = = 
 The New York Times previewed a clip of the music video directed by artist Marco Brambilla , featuring Irina <unk> , Jessica White and African @-@ American albino fashion model Diandra Forrest . The video premiered on MTV on August 5 , 2010 preceding a new episode of Jersey Shore . The " Power " video commences with a portrait @-@ view headshot of West staring intensely into the camera with illuminated eyes and wearing a large , low @-@ hanging gold chain necklace with an equally large pendant of Horus . 
 As the music begins , the camera slowly tracks out in one continuous take to reveal West standing at the end of a hallway of black columns , and surrounded by partially dressed female characters . Some kneel before him , some embrace , four figures wear ibex @-@ like horns ; and some are inverted , pouring water that flows upward . Two horned , staff @-@ bearing figures , loosely resembling interpretations of Isis and Hathor , stand on either side of West ; each slowly strikes the ground with their staff , in time to the music . The Sword of Damocles hangs over the rapper ’ s head , while other slowly moving figures appear ready to strike West with blades . The various figures within the painting are presented in poses similar to the Major Arcana and Minor Arcana of the <unk> occult tarot deck . Anthony <unk> of Daily News described the ending of the video : 
 " The focus of the video turns out to be West 's death . After a few close @-@ up shots of the rapper 's surroundings , Brambilla 's camera pulls back and everyone disappears , leaving only West and the two warriors . Realization dawns that they aren 't swinging at each other , but rather converging on King Kanye . But before they can decapitate him , however , the video cuts to black . " 
 West has called the video a " moving painting " . Brambilla mused about the video that “ it ’ s kind of apocalyptic , in a very personal way , " and that " it ’ s a very exaggerated hyper @-@ sensational version of what the song is saying . ” The video is much shorter than the actual song , lasting less than two minutes and only covering the first verse . It was later revealed that the 103 @-@ second video , which invokes cultural references from the Renaissance period to Greek mythology , is a teaser for a longer clip , though the full @-@ length version of the video never surfaced . One of the reasons proposed why the full version never was released was because " Power " was also used during Runaway , a 35 @-@ minute music video directed by West set to music from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy . 
 MTV Buzzworthy 's Chris Ryan gave a positive review of the video , stating that it " marks a change in the way we look at music videos as a medium -- it 's less a music video , more a modern art montage with a heavy dose of ancient Egyptian imagery and possible references to Michelangelo 's " The Creation of Adam " ( with a fair Kanye @-@ esque helping of chesty females ) . In it , Kanye West ironically builds an unattainable artistic empire fit for a king ( or pharaoh ) , while condemning the role power plays in our lives . So much to think about . " <unk> of Daily News compared the video to the work of Michael Jackson , calling it an event of a video . Hitfix 's Katie Hasty mused that West " put on a crown for ' Jesus Walks , ' so it was only a matter of time before he ascended into heaven " , describing the video as a " little weird , a little funny " . The video for " Power " was nominated for two MTV Music Video awards ; Best Special Effects and Best Art Direction .

 Ever 17 : The Out of Infinity is a visual novel video game developed by KID . It is the second entry in the Infinity series ; it is preceded by Never 7 : The End of Infinity , and followed by Remember 11 : The Age of Infinity , 12Riven : The Psi @-@ Climinal of Integral , and Code _ 18 . It was originally released in Japan on August 29 , 2002 for the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast , and was later ported to Microsoft Windows , PlayStation Portable , Android , and iOS . A localization of the Microsoft Windows version was released by Hirameki International in North America in 2005 . 
 The game follows Takeshi Kuranari and a boy with amnesia who is referred to as " the Kid " , who are trapped inside an underwater theme park together with a group of other people after a leak has flooded parts of the park ; they cannot contact people on the surface , and due to high water pressure , the park is estimated to implode after 119 hours . The gameplay consists of the player reading the game 's story , at certain points making choices that affect its direction , leading to one of several possible endings . 
 The development team included director Takumi Nakazawa , writer and planner Kotaro Uchikoshi , character designer Yuu Takigawa , and composer Takeshi Abo . Because the science fiction aspects of Never 7 had been positively received , Ever 17 was made with a larger focus on science fiction . A remake , simply titled Ever 17 , was developed by 5pb. and Cyberfront for Xbox 360 in 2011 , with the original 's 2D sprites replaced by 3D models ; this change was done as 3D models were seen as being easier to animate . The game has been positively received , with reviewers calling it one of the best in its genre , citing its story , characters , music , and graphics . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Ever 17 is a visual novel in which the player reads the game 's story . At certain points , they get to make a choice , which affects the direction of the story , leading to eleven possible different endings . The whole plot is not revealed in just one ending ; instead , the player has to play through the game multiple times , with each playthrough revealing new information . After playing through the game once , the player is able to fast @-@ forward past text to decision points ; they can also choose to start from a point further into the game , so that they do not have to go back to the beginning of the game for each playthrough . 
 The game has two player characters : Takeshi Kuranari ( <unk> <unk> , Kuranari Takeshi ) and the Kid ( <unk> , Shōnen ) . Depending on the character the player plays as , they get to build relationships with different characters : for instance , the player can become close to Tsugumi Komachi ( <unk> <unk> , Komachi Tsugumi ) when playing as Takeshi , who just is a supporting character when playing as the Kid . The player character is not chosen directly ; instead , a decision the player makes during a blackout in the beginning of the game determines who they will play as .

 = = = Setting and characters = = = 
 Ever 17 is set in Japan , in the underwater marine theme park LeMU , 51 meters below the surface of the artificial island Insel Null . After an incident , almost half of LeMU is flooded , and the path to the surface and the communication lines are cut off , trapping the game 's characters inside . In addition , LeMU is under large water pressure , limiting time to find a means of escape to 119 hours . 
 The player takes the roles of two characters , and sees the story from their respective perspectives : Takeshi Kuranari , a student who visited the park with his friends but got separated from them ; and an amnesiac boy who does not remember his own name , and is simply called " the Kid " . Among other characters are You Tanaka ( <unk> <unk> , Tanaka Yu ) , a part @-@ time employee at LeMU ; Tsugumi Komachi , a woman who is distrustful of the others ; Sora <unk> ( <unk> 空 , <unk> Sora ) , an artificial intelligence and the computer engineer of LeMU , who is only seen through a projection onto the other characters ' eyes ; Sara Matsunaga ( <unk> <unk> , Matsunaga Sara ) , a second @-@ year student and a hacker ; and Coco Yagami ( <unk> <unk> , Yagami Koko ) , a girl who is stranded on LeMU with her dog Pipi . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The game opens on May 1 , 2017 , when a blackout occurs in LeMU , its communications system go down , and the park springs a leak ; portions of it get flooded , blocking the exit and trapping the characters inside . Due to water pressure , the park is estimated to implode after 119 hours ; the water pressure also ensures that the characters cannot escape by swimming , as it would crush their lungs . If the player plays as Takeshi , he builds a relationship with Tsugumi , who reveals that she and her pet hamster <unk> are carriers of the Cure virus , which has rewritten their genetic code , and halted their biological aging . She and Takeshi have sex , and she is impregnated . Later , Coco becomes sick . It is revealed that a research facility exists under LeMU , called IBF , and that LeMU was created by the <unk> Pharmaceutical company as a cover for IBF . The facility developed the deadly virus Tief Blau ; the LeMU disaster was caused when IBF lost containment of it . Coco was exposed to the virus while visiting her father , an IBF researcher . 
 The group goes to IBF in search for a cure , but starts showing signs of Tief Blau . An exception is Tsugumi , as the Cure virus has made her immune ; the group injects themselves with her antibodies . They get contact with the surface , and a rescue pod is sent down , but is only able to stay for a short period of time . Tsugumi disappears to find <unk> , who has gone missing ; Takeshi chases after her , and saves Sora 's data onto a disk , to save her memories . Returning to IBF , they have missed the rescue vessel . They find a submarine and escape , but its batteries die ; Takeshi exits it , giving it enough buoyancy to save Tsugumi , while he dies on the ocean floor . Coco dies in IBF , as she had been looking for Pipi , and the rescue team could not find her . 
 If the player plays as the Kid , Sara is trapped in LeMU instead of Coco ; the Kid frequently has visions of Coco , but no one else sees her . The group manages to contact the surface , and open and close doors to various rooms in LeMU to move the water around , allowing them to escape . After having played the game as both Takeshi and the Kid , the player accesses the final route , in which it is revealed that while the events Takeshi experienced took place in 2017 , those the Kid experienced were a recreation , and took place in a rebuilt LeMU in 2034 . The You of 2017 , whose full first name is Yubiseiharukana , had artificially impregnated herself and given birth to <unk> , who took the role of You during the recreation . Pipi had escaped LeMU in 2017 , carrying with it the disk with Sora 's memories and footage of Coco being trapped in IBF . Sara and the Kid are revealed to be Tsugumi and Takeshi 's children , and the Kid 's real name turns out to be Hokuto . The Kid of 2017 , whose name is <unk> <unk> , played the role of Takeshi during the recreation , having stopped aging due to the Cure virus . 
 The recreation was done to line up two points in the fourth dimension , time , to get the attention of the person playing Ever 17 ; the characters see the player as a 4th @-@ dimensional being , " Blick Winkel " , who can move through time ; Blick Winkel appearing was what caused Hokuto 's amnesia . Yubiseiharukana tells Blick Winkel that they had told her to do the recreation to save Takeshi and Coco . Blick Winkel travels to 2017 , and wakes up Takeshi on the seafloor , forcing him to swim to IBF ; inside , he injects Coco with Tsugumi 's antibodies . Blick Winkel warns Yubiseiharukana in 2017 to not save Takeshi and Coco immediately , to avoid a time paradox ; instead , Blick Winkel has Takeshi and Coco enter cryogenic suspension in IBF . They wake up in 2034 , saved . Sora , who now has a robotic body , is given back her memories from the disk , and Yubiseiharukana leaks information about <unk> , exposing them as being behind the Tief Blau outbreak .

 The game was directed by Takumi Nakazawa , while Kotaro Uchikoshi was the planner and scenario writer , and Yuu Takigawa was the character designer . While the previous game in the series , Never 7 : The End of Infinity , focused on romance with light usage of science fiction themes , the use of these two themes was more balanced in Ever 17 ; the decision to do this was made after the science fiction themes in Never 7 were well received by critics . The game 's setting of " you 're trapped somewhere and trying to escape " was made to embody two of humanity 's instinctive desires : the unconscious desire to return to the safety of one 's mother 's womb and shut oneself away from the world , and the desire to escape from and overcome one 's current condition . While Never 7 had originally been planned as a stand @-@ alone game , it was decided during the development of Ever 17 to connect the two games ' worlds . Development of the game was finished in May 2002 . 
 The game 's soundtrack was composed by Takeshi Abo , and features " geometric music " because of the game 's theoretical and science fiction elements . Prior to composing the music , he read through the game 's story , to understand the setting and each character 's personality as much as possible . He would write his impressions of the plot , with a focus on the " emotional flow " and the events that occur throughout the story ; he valued his first impressions as very important for this . According to Abo , this method takes longer time , but allows him to make better music with a stronger relation to the game 's world than if he had just designated different songs to different points of the game . Because he enjoyed the story , the music strongly reflects Abo 's own musical tastes . Asami Imai performed the opening theme for the PlayStation Portable version of the game .

 A remake of the game , simply titled Ever 17 , was developed for Xbox 360 by 5pb. in collaboration with Cyberfront ; this version was redone from the ground up , and includes new event graphics , re @-@ recorded voices , new routes , and a new ending . It uses 3D models for the conversation scenes ; this move from 2D to 3D was made as 3D character models were seen as being more easily animated than 2D sprites , as they can be posed without the need to draw new poses manually . 
 5pb . ' s executive director , Chiyomaru Shikura , felt that visual novels are above manga but below anime as a media genre , and said that , with the move to 3D , the genre would gradually catch up to anime . He said that while the Xbox 360 market was not strong in Japan , he felt that Japanese Xbox 360 users were people who liked video games a lot , and who had the ability to increase their community ; he believed word @-@ of @-@ mouth to be an important aspect of the Japanese Xbox 360 market . The remake 's theme song was performed by <unk> of the band Asriel .

 Neal Chandran at RPGFan called Ever 17 " a fantastic adventure game " , and one of the best Japanese games in the genre that are available in English , describing it as a " must @-@ play " . He liked the game 's writing , finding the conversations with other characters to be deep , philosophical , and intellectual , and said that each character was interesting . He found the conversations to reading " like conversation should " , but also found the English localization to contain multiple flaws , including spelling mistakes and grammatical errors , such as the misuse of the words " your " and " you 're " . Jason Young at GameZone called the game an " all @-@ age masterpiece [ that ] is nearly flawless in every regard " , and said that it was the best visual novel that was available in English . He said that it was one of the video games with the best characterization in history , and called the game 's plot twist " mind @-@ blowing " . 
 Writers for Famitsu thought that the combination of suspense and romance made for a strange feeling . They found the game system to be characteristic of KID , calling it user @-@ friendly , and saying that it made repeated playthroughs pleasant . Chandran liked the game 's graphics , saying that while they only consist on still 2D images on static backgrounds , the character designs were appealing and the backgrounds were bright and detailed . He called the game 's sound " top notch " , saying that the voice actors did an excellent job with their characters , and that the music was very good ; he liked how it was varied , feeling that it represented the various scenarios and moods in the game well , and that it was a big improvement over the music in the previous game in the series . 
 In 2010 , RPGFan ranked the game as the eighteenth best role @-@ playing game of the 2000s , calling it " a pinnacle of visual novels " , citing its story , which they called " one of the most emotionally charged , intense , deep , and compelling storylines ever seen in a video game " , and the characters , which they said develop believably , ensuring that the player forms an emotional bond to at least one ; they called the character of Tsugumi one of the best tragic heroines they had encountered in a game . Chandran ranked the game as the third best role @-@ playing game from the sixth generation of video game consoles , saying that it was his favorite in the Infinity series , and one his favorite video games overall . 
 = Ross Sea party 1914 – 16 = 
 The Ross Sea party was a component of Sir Ernest Shackleton 's Imperial Trans @-@ Antarctic Expedition 1914 – 17 . Its task was to lay a series of supply depots across the Great Ice Barrier from the Ross Sea to the Beardmore Glacier , along the polar route established by earlier Antarctic expeditions . The expedition 's main party , under Shackleton , was to land on the opposite , Weddell Sea coast of Antarctica , and to march across the continent via the South Pole to the Ross Sea . As the main party would be unable to carry sufficient fuel and supplies for the whole distance , their survival depended on the Ross Sea party 's depots , which would cover the final quarter of their journey . 
 Shackleton set sail from London on his ship Endurance , bound for the Weddell Sea in August 1914 . Meanwhile , the Ross Sea party personnel gathered in Australia , prior to departure for the Ross Sea in the second expedition ship , SY Aurora . Organisational and financial problems delayed their start until December 1914 , which shortened their first depot @-@ laying season . After their arrival the inexperienced party struggled to master the art of Antarctic travel , in the process losing most of their sledge dogs . A greater misfortune occurred when , at the onset of the southern winter , Aurora was torn from its moorings during a severe storm and was unable to return , leaving the shore party stranded . 
 Despite these setbacks , the Ross Sea party survived inter @-@ personnel disputes , extreme weather , illness , and the deaths of three of its members to carry out its mission in full during its second Antarctic season . This success proved ultimately without purpose , because Shackleton 's main expedition was unable to land after Endurance was crushed in the Weddell Sea ice . Shackleton eventually led his men to safety , but the transcontinental march did not take place and the Ross Sea party 's depots were not required . The Ross Sea party remained stranded until January 1917 , when Aurora , which had been repaired and refitted in New Zealand , arrived to rescue them . Public recognition of their efforts was slow in coming , but in due course four Albert Medals were awarded to members of the party , two posthumously . Shackleton later wrote that those who died " gave their lives for their country as surely as those who gave up their lives in France or Flanders . " 
 = = Background = = 
 After the conquest of the South Pole by Roald Amundsen in December 1911 Shackleton , who had sought this achievement himself , was forced to rethink his polar ambitions . He believed that there remained " one great main objective of Antarctic journeyings — the crossing of the South Polar continent from sea to sea . " Basing his strategy on plans developed earlier by the Scottish explorer William Spiers Bruce , Shackleton planned to land with his main party as far south as possible , on the Weddell Sea coast . His transcontinental team would then march southward to the Pole , before continuing across the polar plateau and descending via the Beardmore Glacier ( which Shackleton had discovered in 1909 ) to the Great Ice Barrier . The final stretch would take them across the Barrier to McMurdo Sound on the Ross Sea coast . 
 Shackleton estimated that the crossing would cover approximately 1 @,@ 800 miles ( 2 @,@ 900 km ) , a distance too great for his party to carry all its supplies . In support of the main journey , therefore , a separate Ross Sea party would land in McMurdo Sound and would lay a series of supply depots across the 400 miles ( 640 km ) width of the Barrier , to assist the crossing group home . It would also carry out scientific investigations . Shackleton described the depot @-@ laying as vital to the success of the whole undertaking , but believed it would not present any great difficulties in execution . The Ross Sea party 's vessel would be SY Aurora , a ship recently used by Douglas Mawson and the Australasian Antarctic Expedition . 
 = = Personnel = = 
 To lead the Ross Sea party Shackleton chose Aeneas Mackintosh , having first attempted to persuade the Admiralty to provide him with a naval crew . Mackintosh , like Shackleton , was a former Merchant Navy officer , who had been on the Nimrod expedition until his participation was cut short by an accident that resulted in the loss of his right eye . Another Nimrod veteran , Ernest Joyce , whose Antarctic experiences had begun with Captain Scott 's Discovery Expedition , was appointed to take charge of sledging and dogs . Joyce was described by Shackleton 's biographer , Roland Huntford , as " a strange mixture of fraud , flamboyance and ability " , but his depot @-@ laying work during the Nimrod expedition had impressed Shackleton . Ernest Wild , a Royal Naval petty officer , was added to the party possibly through the persuasion of his brother , Frank Wild , who was travelling as Shackleton 's second @-@ in @-@ command on Endurance . 
 Some of the appointments to the party were made rather hurriedly , reflecting the limited time frame that Shackleton had allowed for preliminary organisation . Joseph Stenhouse , a young officer from the British India Steam Navigation Company , was appointed as the Aurora 's First Officer after travelling from Australia to London to seek an interview with Shackleton . The Reverend Arnold Spencer @-@ Smith , a Scottish Episcopal Church priest and former schoolmaster , joined as a replacement for one of the original members of the expedition who had left for active service in the First World War . Victor Hayward , a London finance clerk with a taste for adventure was recruited on the basis of his having worked on a ranch in Canada . 
 Although the Ross Sea party 's main role was to lay supply depots , Shackleton added a small scientific team to carry out biological , meteorological and magnetic research in the region . The chief scientist in this group was Alexander Stevens , a Scots geologist and former theology student . John Cope , a 21 @-@ year @-@ old Cambridge graduate , was the team 's biologist ; a would @-@ be medical student , he later became ship 's surgeon . Two other scientists were appointed in Australia , the physicist Dick Richards ( who signed up for a nominal wage of £ 1 per week ) and industrial chemist Keith Jack . An Australian cousin of Spencer @-@ Smith 's , Irvine Gaze , was taken on as a general assistant . 
 = = Problems in Australia = = 
 Mackintosh and the nucleus of the party arrived in Sydney , Australia , late in October 1914 . They found that Aurora was in no condition for an Antarctic voyage , and required an extensive overhaul . The registration of the ship in Shackleton 's name had not been properly completed , and Shackleton had evidently misunderstood the terms under which he had acquired the vessel from Mawson . Mawson had reclaimed much of the equipment and stores that had been aboard , all of which needed replacing . To compound the problem , Shackleton had reduced the funds available to Mackintosh from £ 2 @,@ 000 to £ 1 @,@ 000 , expecting him to bridge the difference by soliciting for supplies as free gifts and by mortgaging the ship . There was no cash available to cover the wages and living expenses for the party . 
 Shackleton was now beyond reach , aboard Endurance en route for Antarctica . Supporters of the expedition in Australia , notably Edgeworth David who had served as chief scientist on the Nimrod expedition , were concerned at the plight in which Mackintosh 's party had been placed . They helped to raise sufficient funds to keep the expedition alive , but several members of the party resigned or abandoned the venture . Some of the last @-@ minute replacements were raw recruits ; Adrian Donnelly , a locomotive engineer with no sea experience , signed as second engineer , while wireless operator Lionel Hooke was an 18 @-@ year @-@ old electrical apprentice . 
 Despite all these difficulties , Aurora set out from Sydney on 15 December 1914 , bound for Hobart , where she arrived on 20 December to take on final stores and fuel . On 24 December , three weeks later than the original target sailing date , the Aurora finally sailed for the Antarctic , arriving off Ross Island on 16 January 1915 . Mackintosh decided to establish a shore base at Cape Evans , Captain Scott 's headquarters during the 1910 – 13 Terra Nova Expedition , and to find a safe winter mooring nearby for Aurora . 
 = = First season , 1914 – 15 = = 
 = = = Depot @-@ laying , January – March 1915 = = = 
 Believing that Shackleton might attempt a crossing during the first season , Mackintosh decided that the first two depots had to be laid without delay , one at 79 ° S near Minna Bluff , a prominent Barrier landmark , and another further south at the 80 ° mark . These were , in his view , the minimum that would enable Shackleton 's party to survive a crossing of the Barrier . The delayed arrival of Aurora in the Antarctic had given little time for acclimatisation for the dogs and for the untrained men , and this led to differences of view about how to proceed . Ernest Joyce , by far the most experienced Antarctic traveller in the party , favoured a cautious approach and wanted to delay the start by at least a week . Joyce claimed that Shackleton had given him independent control over sledging activities , a view rejected by Mackintosh and later demonstrated as without foundation . 
 Mackintosh 's view having prevailed , on 24 January 1915 the first of three parties set out for the Barrier journey , the others following on the next day . Further dissension soon arose between Joyce and Mackintosh about how far south the dogs should be taken . Joyce wanted them to go no further than the Bluff , but Mackintosh 's sense of urgency meant that they were taken on to 80 ° S. A further setback was the failure of the attempts to move stores by motor tractor . Although , ultimately , the depots were laid at Minna Bluff and at 80 ° S , the overall operation was beset by problems . Not all the stores had reached the depots , and , as well as the motor tractor failure , all ten dogs taken on the journey perished during the return . By the time that all parties were reunited at Hut Point ( Scott 's old Discovery base at the edge of the Barrier ) on 25 March , the men themselves were exhausted and frostbitten , and there was a significant loss of confidence in Mackintosh . The condition of the sea ice in McMurdo Sound made the journey back to Cape Evans impossible , so the party was stranded until 1 June , in spartan conditions and relying on seals for fresh meat and blubber fuel . 
 It was later revealed that this first depot @-@ laying season , and its attendant hardships , had been unnecessary . Shackleton had stated , in a letter sent from South Georgia on 5 December 1914 ( the date that Endurance left South Georgia for the Weddell Sea ) to Ernest Perris of the Daily Chronicle , that he had " no chance of crossing that season " . Mackintosh was to have been informed of this , but " the cable was never sent " . 
 = = = Loss of the Aurora = = = 
 When Mackintosh departed on 25 January 1915 to lead the depot @-@ laying parties he left the Aurora under the command of First Officer Joseph Stenhouse . The priority task for Stenhouse was to find a winter anchorage in accordance with Shackleton 's instructions not to attempt to anchor south of the Glacier Tongue , an icy protrusion midway between Cape Evans and Hut Point . This search proved a long and hazardous process . Stenhouse manoeuvred in the Sound for several weeks before eventually deciding to winter close to the Cape Evans shore headquarters . After a final visit to Hut Point on 11 March to pick up four early returners from the depot @-@ laying parties , he brought the ship to Cape Evans and made it fast with anchors and hawsers , thereafter allowing it to become frozen into the shore ice . 
 On the night of 7 May a severe gale erupted , tearing the Aurora from its moorings and carrying it out to sea attached to a large ice floe . Attempts to contact the shore party by wireless failed . Held fast , and with its engines out of commission , the Aurora began a long drift northward away from Cape Evans , out of McMurdo Sound , into the Ross Sea and eventually into the Southern Ocean . Ten men were left stranded ashore at Cape Evans . Aurora finally broke free from the ice on 12 February 1916 and managed to reach New Zealand on 2 April . 
 = = = Improvisation = = = 
 Because Mackintosh had intended to use Aurora as the party 's main living quarters , most of the shore party 's personal gear , food , equipment and fuel was still aboard when the ship departed . Although the sledging rations intended for Shackleton 's depots had been landed , the ten stranded men were left with " only the clothes on their backs " . Mackintosh summarised their situation : " We have to face the possibility that we may have to stay here , unsupported , for two years . We cannot expect rescue before then , and so we must conserve and economize on what we have , and we must seek and apply what substitutes we can gather " . Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott 's and Shackleton 's earlier expeditions . These supplies provided a harvest of material , which enabled clothing , footwear and equipment to be improvised , while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel . " Joyce 's Famous Tailoring Shop " fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott 's expedition . Even a brand of tobacco — " Hut Point Mixture " — was concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust , tea , coffee and a few dried herbs . By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season . On the last day of August Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter , and ended : " Tomorrow we start for Hut Point " . 
 = = Second depot @-@ laying season 1915 – 16 = = 
 = = = Journey to Mount Hope = = = 
 The second season 's work was planned in three stages . First , all depot stores — 3 @,@ 800 pounds ( 1 @,@ 700 kg ) in total — were to be transferred from Cape Evans to Hut Point . These stores would then be transported from Hut Point to a base depot at Minna Bluff . Finally , a journey south would be made , to reinforce the 80 ° depot and lay new ones at 81 ° , 82 ° , 83 ° , and lastly at Mount Hope , near the foot of the Beardmore Glacier , at 83 ° 30 ' . 
 Nine men in teams of three would undertake the sledging work . The first stage , hauling over the sea ice to Hut Point , started on 1 September 1915 , and was completed without mishap by the end of the month . The second stage , hauling back and forth between Hut Point and the Bluff , proved more problematic , with unfavourable weather , a difficult Barrier surface , and more dissension between Mackintosh and Joyce over methods . This time , Mackintosh favoured man @-@ hauling while Joyce wanted to use the four fit dogs — of the six dogs that had survived the winter , two were pregnant and could not work . Mackintosh allowed Joyce to proceed in his own way , leading a party of six with the dogs , while Mackintosh continued to man @-@ haul with Wild and Spencer @-@ Smith . Joyce 's methods proved the more effective in terms of loads carried and the fitness of the men . The base depot at Minna Bluff was completed by 28 December . 
 Shortly after the main march to Mount Hope began , on 1 January 1916 , the failure of a Primus stove led to three men ( Cope , Jack and Gaze ) returning to Cape Evans , where they joined Stevens . The scientist had remained at the base to take weather measurements and watch for the ship . The remaining six sledged south , with Spencer @-@ Smith failing rapidly and Mackintosh complaining of a painful knee . They battled on , laying the depots , using only minimum provisions themselves although , at Joyce 's insistence , keeping the dogs well @-@ fed : " The dogs are our only hope ; our lives depend on them . " As they neared Mount Hope , Spencer @-@ Smith collapsed , unable to proceed . The others left him alone in a small tent and travelled the remaining few miles to lay the final depot at Mount Hope on 26 January 1916 . Ernest Wild left a letter for his brother Frank who he assumed was by then travelling across from the Weddell Sea with Shackleton . 
 = = = Return = = = 
 The party turned for home on 27 January , picking up Spencer @-@ Smith on 29th . He was by now physically helpless and had to be loaded on to the sledge . Mackintosh was soon unable to pull , and could only stagger along beside the sledge ; by this time the de facto leadership of the group had passed to Joyce and Richards . Joyce described the group 's plight : " I have never known such shocking conditions . This is one of the hardest pulls since we have trekked ... all we can do is to slog on with the greatest possible speed . " 
 In spite of their difficulties the party made good progress until , on 17 February about 10 miles ( 16 km ) short of the Bluff depot , they were halted by a blizzard . They remained tent @-@ bound for five days , by which time their supplies had run out . In desperation the party left the tent the next day , but it soon proved impossible for Mackintosh and Spencer @-@ Smith to travel further . Joyce , Richards and Hayward then sledged through the blizzard to the Bluff , leaving the invalids in a tent under the care of Wild . This round trip of about 20 miles ( 32 km ) took them a week to complete . They returned with food and fuel to sustain their comrades , and the march resumed . Within a short time Mackintosh joined Spencer @-@ Smith on the sledge , and before long , Hayward too collapsed . The three men still on their feet were by now too weak to haul three invalids , so on 8 March Mackintosh volunteered to stay in the tent while the others attempted to take Spencer @-@ Smith and Hayward to Hut Point . A day later Spencer @-@ Smith died , utterly worn out by exhaustion and scurvy , and was buried in the ice . Joyce and Wild reached Hut Point with Hayward on 11 March and went back for Mackintosh . By 16 March the whole surviving party had reached the hut . 
 From the start of the hauling of loads from Cape Evans on 1 September 1915 to the arrival of the survivors back at Hut Point , a total of 198 days had passed , the longest sledging journey in terms of elapsed time undertaken on any expedition up to that time . 
 = = = Deaths of Mackintosh and Hayward = = = 
 The five survivors slowly recovered their strength with a diet of seal meat . The ice was too thin for them to risk the final trip to Cape Evans , and the monotony of their diet and surroundings became wearisome . On 8 May Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward intended to risk the ice and walk to Cape Evans . Against the strenuous objections of their companions they departed , and within the hour disappeared into a blizzard . The others went to look for them after the storm and found only tracks leading to the edge of the broken ice . Mackintosh and Hayward were never seen again . They had either fallen through the thin ice or had been carried out to sea on an ice floe . Richards , Joyce and Wild waited until 15 July to make the trip to Cape Evans , where they were at last reunited with Stevens , Cope , Jack and Gaze . 
 = = Rescue = = 
 After Aurora 's arrival in New Zealand in April 1916 , Stenhouse began the task of raising funds for the ship 's repair and refit , prior to its return to Antarctica to rescue the marooned men . This proved difficult : nothing had been heard from Shackleton since Endurance had left South Georgia in December 1914 , and it seemed likely that relief expeditions were necessary for both strands of the expedition . However , the Imperial Trans @-@ Antarctic Expedition was completely out of funds , and there was no obvious alternative source of finance . Given the chaotic financial circumstances in which Aurora had departed from Australia , private subscribers were hard to find . Finally , the governments of Australia , New Zealand and Great Britain agreed jointly to fund the refit of Aurora , but insisted on their joint committee having full control of the relief expedition . 
 On 31 May , Shackleton arrived in the Falkland Islands with the story of his escape after the loss of Endurance in the Weddell Sea . His first priority was to effect the rescue of the rest of the Weddell Sea party , stranded on Elephant Island , and it was early December before he arrived in New Zealand . He was too late to influence the organisation of the Ross Sea party 's relief ; the joint committee had appointed John King Davis to lead the expedition and had dismissed Stenhouse and Aurora 's other officers . Davis was a veteran of Mawson 's recent Australasian expedition , and had turned down Shackleton 's offers in 1914 of the command of either Endurance or Aurora . As a gesture , Shackleton was permitted to sail as a supernumerary officer when the ship left on 20 December . On 10 January 1917 , when Aurora reached Cape Evans , the survivors were astonished to see Shackleton approaching them ; they then learned for the first time the futility of their labours . After a further week spent in a vain search for the bodies of Mackintosh and Hayward , Aurora headed north for New Zealand , carrying the seven survivors of the original shore party . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Hut Point and Cape Evans huts remain , protected by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government . Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk , listing the names of those lost , can still be read , but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern . 
 The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea . Shackleton had sold her for £ 10 @,@ 000 , and her new role was as a coal @-@ carrier between Australia and South America . She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean , on or about 2 January 1918 , having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider . Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship 's party , who was still serving as her boatswain . Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War . He died of typhoid in Malta , on 10 March 1918 , while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean . 
 On 4 July 1923 , Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life @-@ saving efforts during the second depot @-@ laying journey . Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award , posthumously . Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers . The young wireless operator , Lionel Hooke , joined Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd and was responsible for many technological innovations . He became the company 's managing director in 1945 and its chairman in 1962 , having been knighted for services to industry in 1957 . Of the four dogs who survived the trek , Con was killed by the other dogs in a fight before the rescue . The others , Oscar , Gunner and <unk> , returned in the ship to New Zealand and were placed in Wellington Zoo , where Oscar lived , allegedly , to the age of 25 . Near the end of his life Dick Richards , the last survivor of the party , was without regrets and did not regard the struggle as futile . Rather , he believed , it was something that the human spirit had accomplished , and that no undertaking carried through to conclusion was for nothing .
