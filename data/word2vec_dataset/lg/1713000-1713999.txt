 After recording the second version of the song , Lennon wanted to do something different with it , as Martin remembered : " He 'd wanted it as a gentle dreaming song , but he said it had come out too raucous . He asked me if I could write him a new line @-@ up with the strings . So I wrote a new score ( with four trumpets and three cellos ) and we recorded that , but he didn 't like it . " Meanwhile , on 8 and 9 December , another basic track was recorded , using a Mellotron , electric guitar , piano , backwards @-@ recorded cymbals , and the <unk> ( or <unk> ) , an Indian version of the zither . After reviewing the tapes of Martin 's version and the original , Lennon told Martin that he liked both versions , although Martin had to tell Lennon that the orchestral score was at a faster tempo and in a higher key ( B major ) than the first version ( A major ) . Lennon said , " You can fix it , George " , giving Martin and Emerick the difficult task of joining the two takes together . With only a pair of editing scissors , two tape machines , and a vari @-@ speed control , Emerick compensated for the differences in key and speed by increasing the speed of the first version and decreasing the speed of the second . He then spliced the versions together , starting the orchestral score in the middle of the second chorus . ( Since the first version did not include a chorus after the first verse , he also spliced in the first seven words of the chorus from elsewhere in the first version . ) The pitch @-@ shifting in joining the versions gave Lennon 's lead vocal a slightly other @-@ worldly " swimming " quality . 
 Some vocalising by Lennon is faintly audible at the end of the song , picked up as leakage onto one of the drum microphones ( close listening shows Lennon making other comments to Ringo ) . In the " Paul is Dead " hoax these were taken to be Lennon saying " I buried Paul . " In 1974 , McCartney said , " That wasn 't ' I buried Paul ' at all – that was John saying ' cranberry sauce ' … That 's John 's humour … If you don 't realise that John 's apt to say cranberry sauce when he feels like it , then you start to hear a funny little word there , and you think , ' Aha ! ' " Shortly before his death in 1980 , Lennon expressed dissatisfaction with the final version of the song , saying it was " badly recorded " and accusing McCartney of subconsciously sabotaging the recording .

 When manager Brian Epstein pressed Martin for a new Beatles ' single , Martin told Epstein that the group had recorded " Strawberry Fields Forever " and " Penny Lane " , which in Martin 's opinion were their two finest songs to date . Epstein said they would issue the songs as a double A @-@ side single , as they had done with their previous single , " Yellow Submarine " / " Eleanor Rigby " . The single was released in the US on 13 February 1967 , and in the United Kingdom on 17 February 1967 . Following the Beatles ' usual philosophy that songs released on a single should not appear on new albums , which wasn 't always the case , both songs were ultimately left off Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . Martin later stated that this was a " dreadful mistake " , even though both were given a belated album appearance on side two of the LP of " Magical Mystery Tour " . It was released as a double EP in the UK , but in the USA the LP had the whole soundtrack on side one with the 1967 singles released on side two ; however , the US LP version is now the CD version . 
 For the first time since " Love Me Do " in 1962 , a single by the Beatles failed to reach number one in the UK charts . It was held at number two by Engelbert Humperdinck 's " Release Me " . In a radio interview at the time , McCartney said he was not upset because Humperdinck 's song was a " completely different type of thing " . Starr said later that it was " a relief " because " it took the pressure off " . " Penny Lane " reached number one in the US , while " Strawberry Fields Forever " peaked at number eight . In the US , both songs were included on the Magical Mystery Tour LP , which was released as a six @-@ track double @-@ EP in the UK . 
 The song was the opening track of the compilation album 1967 – 1970 , released in 1973 , and also appears on the Imagine soundtrack issued in 1988 . In 1996 , three previously unreleased versions of the song were included on the Anthology 2 album : Lennon 's original home demo , an altered version of the first studio take , and the complete take seven , of which only the first minute was heard in the master version . In 2006 , a newly mixed version of the song was included on the album Love . This version builds from an acoustic demo ( which was run at the actual recorded speed ) and incorporates elements of " Hello , Goodbye " , " In My Life " , " Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band " , " Penny Lane " and " Piggies " .

 The Beatles produced a promotional film clip for " Strawberry Fields Forever " , which served as an early example of what became known as a music video . It was filmed on 30 and 31 January 1967 at Knole Park in Sevenoaks , Kent . The clip was directed by Peter Goldmann , a Swedish television director who had been recommended to the Beatles by their mutual friend Klaus Voormann . 
 One of the band 's assistants , Tony Bramwell , served as producer . Bramwell recalls that , inspired by Voormann 's comment on hearing " Strawberry Fields Forever " – that " the whole thing sounded like it was played on a strange instrument " – he spent two days dressing up a large tree in the park to resemble " a piano and harp combined , with strings " . Writing for Mojo magazine in 2007 , John Harris remarked that Bramwell 's set design reflected the " collision of serenity and almost gothic eeriness " behind the finished song . 
 The film features reverse film effects , stop motion animation , jump @-@ cuts from daytime to night @-@ time , and the Beatles playing and later pouring paint over the upright piano . During the same visit to Knole Park , the band shot part of the promotional film for " Penny Lane " . 
 In 2015 , the promo film was included in the three @-@ disc versions ( titled 1 + ) of the Beatles ' compilation 1 .

 Among initial reviews of the single , the NME 's Derek Johnson confessed to being both fascinated and confused by " Strawberry Fields Forever " , writing : " Certainly the most unusual and way @-@ out single The Beatles have yet produced – both in lyrical content and scoring . Quite honestly , I don 't really know what to make of it . " Time magazine hailed the song as " the latest sample of the Beatles ' astonishing inventiveness " . 
 " Strawberry Fields Forever " has continued to receive acclaim from music critics . Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes the song as " one of The Beatles ' peak achievements and one of the finest Lennon @-@ McCartney songs " . Ian MacDonald wrote in Revolution in the Head that it " shows expression of a high order … few if any [ contemporary composers ] are capable of displaying feeling and fantasy so direct , spontaneous , and original . " In 2004 , this song was ranked number 76 on Rolling Stone 's list of " The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " . 
 In 2010 , Rolling Stone placed it at number three on the 100 Greatest Beatles Songs . " Strawberry Fields Forever " was ranked as the second @-@ best Beatles song by Mojo , after " A Day in the Life " . The song is ranked as the 8th greatest of all time by Acclaimed Music . XFM radio placed the song 73rd in their list of the 100 Best British Songs and 176th in their Top 1000 Songs of All Time list .

 Paul Revere & the Raiders were among the most successful US groups during 1966 and 1967 , having their own Dick Clark @-@ produced television show , Where the Action Is . Mark Lindsay ( singer / saxophonist ) heard the song on the radio , bought it , and then listened to it at home with his producer at the time , Terry Melcher . When the song ended Lindsay said , " Now what the fuck are we gonna do ? " later saying , " With that single , the Beatles raised the ante as to what a pop record should be " . 
 It has been written by Steven Gaines in the biography Heroes and Villains that Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys heard the single while he was underway with his legendary unfinished album , Smile . Later , the event was claimed by Gaines to have been one of many factors that accelerated Wilson 's already plummeting emotional state and the project 's imminent collapse , as Wilson could not find a way to complete the album to his satisfaction , and by the Beach Boys ' former manager Jack <unk> 's account , feared that what he had accomplished over the last several months of recording would sound dated to contemporary rock audiences . In 2014 , Wilson stated that he thought " Strawberry Fields Forever " was " a weird record " , but denied that it had " weakened " him . 
 The promotional films for " Strawberry Fields Forever " and " Penny Lane " were selected by New York 's MoMA as two of the most influential music videos of the late 1960s . Both were originally broadcast in the US on 25 February 1967 , on the variety show The Hollywood Palace , with actor Van Johnson as host . The Ed Sullivan Show and other variety shows soon dropped their time constraints to allow for psychedelic music performances . 
 A cartoon based on the song was the final episode produced for The Beatles animated television series . " Strawberry Fields Forever " figures prominently in the Spanish film Living Is Easy with Eyes Closed ( 2013 ) , in which a fictional story is told of Lennon 's true , original development of the song in 1966 in Spain .

 The song has been covered a number of other times , notably by Peter Gabriel in 1976 on the musical documentary All This and World War II , and by Ben Harper for the soundtrack of the film I Am Sam . Vanilla Fudge , the debut album by American rock band Vanilla Fudge , also contains a brief homage to " Strawberry Fields Forever " at the end of their cover of " Eleanor Rigby " ( the homage is entitled " <unk> " on CD versions of the album , and CD versions of the album in fact additionally spell out an acrostic of the song as an homage , with portions of preceding tracks entitled " <unk> " , " <unk> " and " <unk> " ) . Todd Rundgren 's version of the song was released on his 1976 album Faithful . The song was also covered by Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson for the 2007 movie Across the Universe . Los Fabulosos Cadillacs recorded a ska version of the song featuring Debbie Harry for their album Rey <unk> , which was a hit throughout Latin America . 
 " Strawberry Fields Forever " has also been covered by Richie Havens ( at the Woodstock Festival ) , Trey Anastasio , the Bee Gees , the Bobs , Campfire Girls , Eugene Chadbourne , Justin Currie , Design , Noel Gallagher , Richie Havens , Hayseed Dixie , Laurence Juber , David Lanz , Cyndi Lauper , Zlatko <unk> , Marilyn Manson , Me First and the Gimme Gimmes , Mother 's Finest , Odetta , Andy Partridge , Plastic Penny , Pip Pyle , the Residents , Miguel Ríos , the Runaways , the Shadows , Gwen Stefani , Tomorrow , Transatlantic , Michael <unk> , the Ventures , Cassandra Wilson , Otomo <unk> , XTC , Ultraviolet Sound Sandy Farina , the Deviants , and Karen Souza . 
 The song returned to the charts 23 years later when British dance group Candy Flip released an electronic version of the song . The song was generally well @-@ received , AllMusic describing it as " funkier and more club @-@ happy than the Beatles ' original " and was a commercial success on both sides of the Atlantic , reaching number three in the UK pop charts and number eleven on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart . 
 In the realm of contemporary or experimental classical music , the vocal melody for " Strawberry Fields Forever " is referenced as source material for the piano score of composer Alvin Lucier 's 1990 composition " Nothing is Real " in which the piano part , recorded in real time , is subsequently played back through a small speaker located within a teapot . Following instructions in the notated score , the pianist then raises and lowers the teapot lid , changing the acoustic filtering properties of the teapot as a resonator while attempting to filter specific frequencies as notated in the score .

 = Hurricane Estelle ( 1986 ) = 
 Hurricane Estelle was the first major hurricane of the above @-@ average 1986 Pacific hurricane season . It formed as a tropical depression formed well southwest of the Baja California Peninsula on July 16 , and strengthened into a tropical storm within 24 hours . Located within a favorable environment , Estelle intensified into a hurricane on July 18 . It attained major hurricane status ( Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale ) two days later . After peaking in intensity at Category 4 strength , Estelle slowly weakened . By July 24 , Estelle was no longer a hurricane while passing south of Hawaii . It completely dissipated on July 26 after further deteriorating to a tropical depression . The arrival of the hurricane prompted a hurricane watch for Hawaii , and 200 people evacuated from their homes . Hurricane Estelle produced high waves offshore Hawaii , causing $ 2 million in damage and two deaths . The remnants of the storm also produced intermittent showers across the state , though there was no major damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Based on data from satellite imagery and weather reports from the cargo ships Hamburg Express and Aleksander <unk> , the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center ( EPHC ) upgraded a tropical disturbance into a tropical depression . At this time , the depression was located 390 mi ( 630 km ) west of Clipperton Island , a small remote island in the Pacific Ocean , at 1200 UTC July 16 . Moving towards the west beneath a high pressure area , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Estelle 12 hours after formation . Upon being named sea surface temperatures along the storm 's path were 84 ° F ( 29 ° C ) , and thus Estelle began to rapidly intensify . The EPHC reported that Estelle had intensified a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale on 1200 UTC July 17 , 24 hours after first forming . 
 Shortly after attaining hurricane intensity , an eye began to appear on weather satellite imagery . Based on this , the EPHC re @-@ assessed the intensity of the system at 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) . Continuing to intensity , Hurricane Estelle became the first major hurricane of the 1986 Pacific hurricane season on 0000 UTC July 18 . As its motion accelerated , Estelle peaked intensity at 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) . Moving west , Hurricane Estelle emerged into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility while still a major hurricane . Shortly thereafter , Estelle 's forward motion increased to close to 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) . As such , forecasters noted the path of a potential landfall on the Big Island . Due to a shearing environment from a trough , Estelle weakened as it continued to approach Hawaii . A possible re @-@ curve towards the island never materialized , and the hurricane veered to west and passed south of the islands . Estelle weakened to a tropical storm on July 23 while passing south of Hawaii , and two days later it weakened to a depression . The tropical cyclone dissipated on July 27 . 
 = = Preparations , impact , and observation = = 
 On July 22 , the National Weather Service issued a hurricane watch and high @-@ surf advisory for the Island of Hawaii as the storm was anticipated to produce life @-@ threatening waves throughout the island chain . Gale warnings and small craft advisories were also issued . Hurricane Estelle was described by meteorologists as " small but dangerous " . More than 200 people evacuated from their homes near the shoreline , but others refused to leave . However , the hurricane watch was dropped on July 24 when Estelle weakened to a tropical storm . 
 Due to its rapid motion , Estelle kept pace with a large swell of water that it generated . In combination with a high spring tide and peripheral winds generated by Estelle , 15 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) to 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) waves crashed on the shores of the Big Island on the afternoon of July 22 . Five homes were destroyed and another five sustained extreme damage . Twelve other homes received minor damage . Three beachfront divisions were destroyed . Dozens of other places in Vacation Land were also damaged . On Maui , waves washed away a dirt road on the eastern part of the island between <unk> and Kaupo . After Estelle passed by the islands , moisture related to the tropical cyclone caused heavy rainfall in the Ka 'u and Puna districts on the Big Island . On July 22 , a wind gust of 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) was recorded near Kalapana Sand Beach . The total damage was around $ 2 million ( 1986 USD ) . Two drownings were reported on Oahu that occurred on July 23 , due to rough surf caused by Estelle . 
 Although isolated showers were initially recorded in the southern portion of the state , after Hurricane Estelle dissipated , its moisture became entrapped in a trough over the islands , causing significant rainfall and thunderstorms over the archipelago . Some areas in Hawaii received 5 in ( 130 mm ) to 10 in ( 250 mm ) . The rains in Hawaii had cleared up by July 29 . 
 Estelle was a well @-@ observed storm , with Reconnaissance Aircraft flying into the hurricane to provide a fix on its location . It also passed near NOAA Buoy <unk> on July 22 , providing valuable meteorological data for its future path . 
 = Field hockey pitch = 
 A hockey pitch is the playing surface for the game of field hockey . Historically , the game was played on natural turf ( grass ) but nowadays is predominantly played on an artificial turf . The transition onto artificial pitches came during the 1970s and was made mandatory for major competitions in 1976 . All the lines , markings and goal specifications are outlined by the International Hockey Federation in " The Rules of Hockey " . 
 All line markings on the pitch form part of the area which they define . For example , a ball on the side line is still in the field of play ; a ball on the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle ; a foul committed over the 23 @-@ metre ( 25 @-@ yard ) line has occurred in the 23 @-@ metre area . A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play , and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored . 
 Due to the original formulation of the rules in England , the standard dimensions of a hockey pitch were originally expressed in imperial units . The rules are now expressed explicitly in metric dimensions ( since 1998 ) although the use of the imperial terms remains common in some countries . 
 = = Field of play = = 
 The hockey pitch is rectangular in shape . The longer perimeter edges are called the side line , the opposing shorter edges are referred toe back line and the portion of this between the goal posts is known as the goal line . The side line must measure 91 @.@ 40 m ( 100 yd ) and the back line should measure 55 @.@ 00 m ( 60 yd ) . There must be a minimum run @-@ off of 2 m at the sidelines and 3 m at the <unk> which may be a different surface for the final metre . All line markings must be white and 75 millimetres wide . In each corner of the pitch , a corner flag of no more than 300 mm square is attached to a post of height 1 @.@ 20 – 1 @.@ 50 m . 
 Historically , the pitch dimensions were imperial and were replaced by metric equivalents in 1998 . The first recorded rules represented what London clubs were using at the time . Surbiton Hockey Club 's minutes from 1876 stated that pitches were to be " 100 – 150 yards ( 91 – 137 m ) long and 50 – 80 yards ( 46 – 73 m ) wide " . Rules by the Hockey Association of England in 1886 specified " 100 yards long by 55 to 60 yards ( 50 to 55 m ) wide " . In 1905 , the International Rules Board allowed the width of the pitch to be " up to 66 yards ( 60 m ) " but this decision was reversed in 1909 . In 1975 , the current width of 60 yards was written into the rules . 
 On artificial surfaces , the field of play should be coloured green , ultramarine blue or signal blue . It is permitted for the run @-@ off portion of the pitch to be an alternative colour . 
 = = Goal = = 
 Goals consist of two upright posts placed equidistant from the centre of the backline , joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar . The inner edges of the posts must be 3 @.@ 66 metres ( 4 yd ) apart , and the lower edge of the crossbar must be 2 @.@ 14 metres ( 7 ft ) above the ground . The goalposts and crossbar must be white and rectangular in shape with width 50 millimetres ( 2 in ) and a depth of 50 to 75 millimetres ( 2 to 3 in ) . A backboard of height 460 millimetres ( 18 in ) extends for the width of the goal and a sideboard of the same height must extend for at least 1 @.@ 20 m ; the goal must be at least this deep at ground level and at least 0 @.@ 90 m deep at crossbar level . <unk> to these boards , the posts and crossbar is a net to stop the ball . 
 The first hockey goals were " 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) tall posts placed 6 yards ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) apart " but were reduced to 4 yards ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) apart in the 1886 rules . In 1987 , a rule was introduced so that at penalty corners " the first hit at goal should not cross the goal @-@ line higher than 18 inches ( 460 mm ) " . This saw the introduction of a sideboard and backboard to the goals which are now mandatory . 
 = = Circle = = 
 A goal is scored when the ball passes completely over the goal line but only if the ball was played ( by a defensive or offensive player ) in the penalty circle . Additionally , the circle marks the area a goalkeeper may play the ball with any part of his body and the area where an infringement by a defender results in a penalty corner . The terminology circle ( or D ) is widely used although the area is actually formed by a 3 @.@ 66 @-@ metre ( 4 yd ) straight line , parallel to the goal line , connected to two 14 @.@ 63 @-@ metre ( 16 yd ) quadrant arcs . 
 The 1876 rules stated that " no goals shall be allowed if the ball be hit from a distance of more than 15 yards ( 14 m ) from the nearest goalpost " . A visible " striking circle " with " radius of 15 yards " was codified in 1886 . The radius of the circle was increased to 16 yards ( 15 m ) in 1951 for men 's hockey and 1968 for women 's hockey . Any free @-@ hit within 5 m of the circle must be taken back to 5 m from the circle ; a broken circle 5 m from the penalty circle denotes this location and became mandatory in 2000 . 
 A penalty spot is centrally positioned directly in front of the goal and used for a penalty stroke . The spot is 150 mm in diameter and its centre is 6 @.@ 475 m from the outside of the goal line . Penalty strokes were introduced in 1963 for deliberately stopping a certain goal ; they were originally taken 8 yards ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) from goal . In 1973 , a stroke could also be awarded for a deliberate foul in the circle and the spot was moved to 7 yards ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) from goal the following year .

 A half @-@ way line , parallel to the back line , divides the pitch in two . The start of each period of play and resumption of play following a goal starts with all players in the half they are defending . The line was also used for the <unk> offside rule . 
 Each half of the pitch is then divided again by a line , referred to as the 23 metre line or 25 yard line , positioned 22 @.@ 90 m from each back line . Historically , this was first used to resume play after the ball passed over the back line and marked by flags at the side of the pitch . In 1949 , deliberate defensive offenses in this area resulted in a penalty corner . From 1961 , players on the defensive team who were not involved at the penalty corner stood behind this line ( this was then moved to the half @-@ way line two years later ) . The line was also used for the offside rule between 1987 until the rule was abolished in 1996 . Nowadays , there are detailed rules regarding fouls and free @-@ hits in the 23 metre region of the pitch . Since 2015 , the 23 metre line has also been used for the attacking team to resume play when it has gone over the back line ( this replaced long corners ) . 
 There are additional markings 300 mm long and perpendicular to the back line that denote distances of 10 m and 5 m from each goal post . These are relevant at a penalty corner ; the former is the mark from which the attacking team takes the penalty corner and the latter is the closest position which a defender may stand . These marks had been 5 and 10 yards ( 4 @.@ 6 and 9 @.@ 1 m ) in earlier versions of the rules . There is a similar mark 5 m from along the side line ( from where long corners were formally taken ) and a mark 14 @.@ 6 m along the side line indicating the level of the top of the penalty circle . There are also 150 mm long markings where the goal posts are situated . 
 = = Artificial playing surface = = 
 Historically , the game was developed on natural grass turf . However , in 1976 , the International Hockey Federation ( <unk> ) made artificial pitches mandatory at all major competitions . The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal was the first of these ; however at this time few players had seen nor played on synthetic pitches . Although it is still permissible to play on natural turf all national competitions and international matches must be played on an artificial surface . Elite @-@ level competitions , such as the Olympic Games and World Cup , require a water @-@ based playing surface . However , due to water conservation efforts , this is not seen as a long @-@ term sustainable option and alternative elite surfaces that do not require water are being researched . 
 There are three main types of artificial hockey surface : 
 <unk> or water @-@ based - artificial fibres that are densely packed for stabilisation , requires irrigation or watering to avoid pitch wear 
 Dressed or sand @-@ dressed - artificial fibres can be less densely packed and sand supports the fibres for part of the pile depth 
 Filled or sand @-@ filled - artificial fibres can be longer and less densely packed and sand supports the fibres for 100 % of the pile depth 
 On water @-@ based pitches , shorter fibres and wetted turf reduce friction and increase the speed at which the game can be played . However , these pitches require watering before , during and after the game and maintenance costs are significant . Sand @-@ dressed pitches cost more than sand @-@ filled pitches but are preferable for hockey as there is an absence of sand close to the playing surface . However , a multi @-@ purpose surface suitable for sports including association football and tennis is often required and hockey may not be the predominant sport . There are many different specifications and categorisations for artificial turf including shock absorption , surface rebound , friction , and strength outlined by the International Hockey Federation . Recently , longer @-@ pile third @-@ generation or 3G pitches have become popular , especially for football , but these do not usually meet the <unk> 's test criteria ; they are often too inconsistent and slow . 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 The World Hockey magazine reported on the first hockey tournament played on an artificial pitch in 1975 — a trial event in Montreal prior to the Olympics — and said the surface had " enormous benefits " . Steve Ruskin , of Sports Illustrated , said that " A slow , analytical game gave way to one of nonstop , true @-@ hop action . " However , it has been stated that the decision to make artificial surfaces mandatory greatly favoured more affluent Western countries who could afford these new pitches . Before the switch to an artificial surface the Indian men 's hockey team were dominant , winning seven of the eight Olympic gold medals between 1928 and 1964 . In 1996 , Indian hockey player Ajit Pal Singh stated that despite its size " [ India ] can afford only 12 or so AstroTurf fields " . <unk> Singh , captain of the Indian men 's hockey team , said that " hockey players in India play on astroturf [ sic ] for the first time at the age of 19 or 20 and find it hard to adapt . " However , the Pakistan hockey team have performed well following the change of surface despite the country being worse off economically and having fewer artificial pitches . When describing the change of surface , Ruskin said that " for India it was like starting over , with all nations even in field hockey . " 
 = French battlecruiser proposals = 
 In the years before the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , the French Navy considered several proposals for battlecruisers . The Navy issued specifications for a battlecruiser design to complete part of the 28 capital ships to be built by 1920 . Three designs , one by P. Gille and two by Lieutenant Durand @-@ Viel , were completed in 1913 . All three designs were similar to contemporary battleship designs , specifically the Normandie class , which introduced a quadruple gun turret for the main battery , which was adopted for all three proposals . The first two called for the same 340 mm ( 13 in ) gun used on all French dreadnoughts , though the third proposed a much more powerful 370 mm ( 15 in ) gun . Though the design studies were complete , the French Navy did not authorize or begin construction of any battlecruisers before the start of the war . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the Naval Law of 30 March 1912 , the French Navy called for a total force of 20 capital ships to be built by 1920 . The Technical Branch subsequently issued a set of somewhat vague requirements for battlecruiser designs . The requirements stipulated a displacement of 28 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 28 @,@ 000 long tons ; 31 @,@ 000 short tons ) , a speed of 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) , an armament of eight 340 mm ( 13 in ) guns , and a crew of not more than 1 @,@ 200 officers and enlisted men . Numerous proposals were submitted to the Technical Branch , but only two were evaluated further . The first was prepared by P. Gille , a naval engineer overseeing the construction of the Normandie @-@ class battleship Flandre , and the second by then @-@ Lieutenant Durand @-@ Viel , a student at the Naval College . As the proposals were only design studies , none were authorized and no ships were built . 
 = = Gille 's design = = 
 In 1911 , Gille went to Britain to observe the construction of the new Orion @-@ class battleships and Lion @-@ class battlecruisers . The latter ships prompted Gille to decide the French Navy ought to build battlecruisers as well , since Britain and Germany had already begun acquiring them , and they would prove useful as a fast division of the French fleet . Gille decided that his proposed ship would need a top speed of 28 to 29 kn ( 52 to 54 km / h ; 32 to 33 mph ) to retain an advantage over foreign battleships , the latest of which had estimated speeds of 22 to 23 kn ( 41 to 43 km / h ; 25 to 26 mph ) . They would also need enough armor and a main battery powerful enough to fight in the line of battle . The limitations that weight imposed on the design , however , restricted the amount of armor possible , and so the traditional French practice of armoring the entire side of the ship would be impossible . 
 = = = Characteristics = = = 
 Gille 's battlecruiser design called for a displacement of 28 @,@ 247 t ( 27 @,@ 801 long tons ; 31 @,@ 137 short tons ) on a hull that was 205 meters ( 673 ft ) long between perpendiculars , with a beam of 27 m ( 88 ft 7 in ) at the waterline and an average draft of 9 @.@ 03 m ( 29 ft 8 in ) . The freeboard forward was 7 @.@ 15 m ( 23 ft 5 in ) , and aft was 4 @.@ 65 m ( 15 @.@ 3 ft ) . The hull lines of the ships proved to be highly efficient in tank tests during the design process . Due to the extreme weight of the main battery turrets at the bow and stern , the hull had to be strengthened to handle the strain . Very strong longitudinal bracing was incorporated , and the inner and outer skins of the hull was thickened to reinforce the <unk> . The ships ' expected metacentric height was 1 @.@ 03 m ( 3 ft 5 in ) , comparable to the British Lion class . Each ship would be crewed by 41 officers and 1 @,@ 258 enlisted men . 
 The ships would have been equipped with four sets of steam turbines rated at 80 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 60 @,@ 000 kW ) powered by fifty @-@ two coal @-@ fired Belleville boilers . Each propeller shaft was connected to a high @-@ pressure turbine , a medium @-@ pressure geared turbine , and a low @-@ pressure turbine for forward steaming , and a direct drive turbine for steaming in reverse . The ships ' top speed was to have been 28 knots . The ships would have been supplied with 2 @,@ 833 t ( 2 @,@ 788 long tons ; 3 @,@ 123 short tons ) of coal and 630 t ( 620 long tons ; 690 short tons ) of fuel oil for supplementary oil firing . At maximum speed , the ships could have cruised for 1 @,@ 660 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 070 km ; 1 @,@ 910 mi ) ; at 20 @.@ 3 kn ( 37 @.@ 6 km / h ; 23 @.@ 4 mph ) , the range increased to 4 @,@ 240 nmi ( 7 @,@ 850 km ; 4 @,@ 880 mi ) , an at a more economical 15 kn ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) , the range grew to 6 @,@ 300 nmi ( 11 @,@ 700 km ; 7 @,@ 200 mi ) . 
 The ships ' main armament was composed of twelve 340mm / 45 Modèle 1912 guns in three quadruple turrets , the same as in the contemporary French battleships of the Normandie class . One turret was placed forward , and the other two were placed in a superfiring pair , all on the centerline . The guns had a range of 16 @,@ 000 m ( 17 @,@ 000 yd ) and had a rate of fire of two rounds per minute . The shells were 540 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 190 lb ) armor @-@ piercing rounds and were fired with a muzzle velocity of 800 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) . A secondary battery of twenty @-@ four 138 @.@ 6 mm / 55 Modèle 1910 guns mounted in casemates was planned for defense against torpedo boats . These guns fired a 36 @.@ 5 kg ( 80 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 830 m / s ( 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ) . The armament was rounded out by six torpedo tubes of undetermined diameter , all submerged in the ships ' hulls . 
 The armor protecting both the main armored belt amidships and the main battery turrets was 270 mm ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) thick . The lower armored deck was 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick , with 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) of armor plating on the sloped sides . The casemate guns were protected with 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) of steel armor . The ships were also equipped with a 20 mm thick torpedo bulkhead .

 In 1913 , the Naval College had several of its students submit design studies for a fast capital ship . The class was given a displacement of 27 @,@ 500 t ( 27 @,@ 100 long tons ; 30 @,@ 300 short tons ) as a limit on size ; all of the officers opted to design either fast or slow battleships , with the exception of Lieutenant Durand @-@ Viel , who chose instead to create a design for a battlecruiser . Durand @-@ Viel drew up a pair of designs , which were evaluated by the General Staff in June 1914 . He saw his ships forming a fast division of the battle fleet capable of encircling an enemy squadron ; as with Gille 's design , this required heavy armament and armor to permit the ships to engage battleships .

 Durand @-@ Viel 's first battlecruiser design , " A " , was built on a displacement of 27 @,@ 500 t ( 27 @,@ 100 long tons ; 30 @,@ 300 short tons ) .

The ships could have cruised for 3 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 500 km ; 4 @,@ 000 mi ) at 16 kn ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) , with enough fuel for an additional six hours for combat speeds . 
 The ships ' main armament was composed of eight 340mm / 45 Modèle 1912 guns in two quadruple turrets , the same as in the contemporary French battleships of the Normandie class . Both turrets were placed on the centerline , on either end of the ship .

 Durand @-@ Viel 's second battlecruiser design , " B " , was built on the same displacement as the first design . The heavier weight of the increased main battery was offset by a reduction in the armor protection for the secondary guns and improved performance of the ship 's propulsion system . The hull was 208 meters ( 682 ft ) long at the waterline , with a beam of 27 m at the waterline and an average draft of 8 @.@ 7 m . Two engine systems were considered : four direct drive turbines rated at 63 @,@ 000 shp ( 47 @,@ 000 kW ) or four geared turbines rated at 80 @,@ 000 shp ( 60 @,@ 000 kW ) . Steam was provided by eighteen Belleville boilers , ten of which that burned both coal and oil , and eight that were oil @-@ fired only . The ships ' top speed was to have been 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) for the first variant and 27 knots for the second . The ships would have been supplied with the same fuel allotment as the " A " design , with the same radius of action as well . 
 The ships ' main armament was composed of eight 370 mm ( 15 in ) guns in two quadruple turrets . Both turrets were placed on the centerline , on either end of the ship . The gun fired a 880 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 940 lb ) shell that was capable of penetrating 300 mm ( 12 in ) of armor plate at a range of 12 @,@ 700 m ( 41 @,@ 700 ft ) .

Four 47 mm saluting guns were also to be installed . The should would also to have carried four 450 mm torpedo tubes , all submerged in the ships ' hulls . The ships ' armor system was identical to the " A " design . 
 = Chinese classifier = 
 The modern Chinese varieties make frequent use of what are called classifiers or measure words . One of the basic uses of classifiers is in phrases in which a noun is qualified by a numeral . When a phrase such as " one person " or " three books " is translated into Chinese , it is normally necessary to insert an appropriate classifier between the numeral and the noun . For example , in Standard Mandarin , the first of these phrases would be 一个人 yī ge rén , where yī means " one " , rén means " person " , and ge is the required classifier . There are also other grammatical contexts in which classifiers are used , including after the demonstratives <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ( " this " ) and <unk> nà ( " that " ) ; however , when a noun stands alone without any such qualifier , no classifier is needed . There are also various other uses of classifiers : for example , when placed after a noun rather than before it , or when repeated , a classifier signifies a plural or indefinite quantity . 
 The terms " classifier " and " measure word " are frequently used interchangeably ( as equivalent to the Chinese term 量词 ( <unk> ) liàngcí , which literally means " measure word " ) . Sometimes , however , the two are distinguished , with classifier denoting a particle without any particular meaning of its own , as in the example above , and measure word denoting a word for a particular quantity or measurement of something , such as " drop " , " <unk> " , or " liter " . The latter type also includes certain words denoting lengths of time , units of currency , etc . These two types are alternatively called count @-@ classifier and mass @-@ classifier , since the first type can only meaningfully be used with count nouns , while the second is used particularly with mass nouns . However , the grammatical behavior of words of the two types is largely identical . 
 Most nouns have one or more particular classifiers associated with them , often depending on the nature of the things they denote . For example , many nouns denoting flat objects such as tables , papers , beds , and benches use the classifier 张 ( 張 ) zhāng , whereas many long and thin objects use 条 ( 條 ) tiáo . The total number of classifiers in Chinese may be put at anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred , depending on how they are counted . The classifier 个 ( 個 ) , pronounced gè or ge in Mandarin , apart from being the standard classifier for many nouns , also serves as a general classifier , which may often ( but not always ) be used in place of other classifiers ; in informal and spoken language , native speakers tend to use this classifier far more than any other , even though they know which classifier is " correct " when asked . Mass @-@ classifiers might be used with all sorts of nouns with which they make sense : for example , <unk> hé ( " box " ) may be used to denote boxes of objects , such as lightbulbs or books , even though those nouns would be used with their own appropriate count @-@ classifiers if being counted as individual objects . Researchers have differing views as to how classifier – noun pairings arise : some regard them as being based on innate semantic features of the noun ( for example , all nouns denoting " long " objects take a certain classifier because of their inherent <unk> ) , while others see them as motivated more by analogy to prototypical pairings ( for example , " dictionary " comes to take the same classifier as the more common word " book " ) . There is some variation in the pairings used , with speakers of different dialects often using different classifiers for the same item . Some linguists have proposed that the use of classifier phrases may be guided less by grammar and more by stylistic or pragmatic concerns on the part of a speaker who may be trying to foreground new or important information . 
 Many other languages of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area exhibit similar classifier systems , leading to speculation about the origins of the Chinese system . Ancient classifier @-@ like constructions , which used a repeated noun rather than a special classifier , are attested in Old Chinese as early as 1400 BCE , but true classifiers did not appear in these phrases until much later . Originally , classifiers and numbers came after the noun rather than before , and probably moved before the noun sometime after 500 BCE . The use of classifiers did not become a mandatory part of Chinese grammar until around 1100 CE . Some nouns became associated with specific classifiers earlier than others , the earliest probably being nouns that signified culturally valued items such as horses and poems . Many words that are classifiers today started out as full nouns ; in some cases their meanings have been gradually bleached away so that they are now used only as classifiers . 
 = = Usage = = 
 In Chinese , a numeral cannot usually quantify a noun by itself ; instead , the language relies on classifiers , commonly also referred to as measure words . When a noun is preceded by a number , a demonstrative such as this or that , or certain <unk> such as every , a classifier must normally be inserted before the noun . Thus , while English speakers say " one person " or " this person " , Mandarin Chinese speakers say 一个人 ( yí ge rén , one @-@ CL person ) or <unk> ( <unk> ge rén , this @-@ CL person ) , respectively . If a noun is preceded by both a demonstrative and a number , the demonstrative comes first . ( This is just as in English , e.g. " these three cats " . ) If an adjective modifies the noun , it typically comes after the classifier and before the noun . The general structure of a classifier phrase is 
 demonstrative – number – classifier – adjective – noun 
 The tables below give examples of common types of classifier phrases . While most English nouns do not require classifiers or measure words ( except in rare cases like " five head of cattle " ) , nearly all Chinese nouns do ; thus , in the first table , phrases that have no classifier in English have one in Chinese . 
 On the other hand , when a noun is not counted or introduced with a demonstrative , a classifier is not necessary : for example , there is a classifier in <unk> ( sān <unk> <unk> , three @-@ CL car , " three cars " ) but not in <unk> ( wǒ @-@ de <unk> , me @-@ possessive car , " my car " ) . Furthermore , numbers and demonstratives are often not required in Chinese , so speakers may choose not to use one — and thus not to use a classifier . For example , to say " Zhangsan turned into a tree " , both <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> yì kē <unk> , Zhangsan become PAST one CL tree ) and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , Zhangsan become PAST tree ) are acceptable . The use of classifiers after demonstratives is in fact optional . Likewise , in colloquial speech and in certain idioms , classifiers are sometimes not used even in numeral phrases . 
 It is also possible for a classifier alone to qualify a noun , the numeral ( " one " ) being omitted , as in <unk> <unk> <unk> mǎ " buy CL horse " , i.e. " buy a horse " . 
 = = = Specialized uses = = = 
 In addition to their uses with numbers and demonstratives , classifiers have some other functions . A classifier placed after a noun expresses a plural or indefinite quantity of it . For example , <unk> ( shū @-@ běn , book @-@ CL ) means " the books " ( e.g. on a shelf , or in a library ) , whereas the standard pre @-@ nominal construction <unk> ( yì běn shū , one @-@ CL book ) means " one book " . 
 Many classifiers may be reduplicated to mean " every " . For example , <unk> ( gè @-@ ge rén , CL @-@ CL person ) signifies " every person " . 
 Finally , a classifier used along with 一 ( yī , " one " ) and after a noun conveys a meaning close to " all of " or " the entire " or " a _ _ _ ful of " . The sentence <unk> ( <unk> yí <unk> <unk> , sky one @-@ CL cloud ) , meaning " the sky was full of clouds " , uses the classifier <unk> ( <unk> , slice ) , which refers to the sky , not the clouds . 
 = = Types = = 
 The vast majority of classifiers are those that count or classify nouns ( nominal classifiers , as in all the examples given so far , as opposed to verbal classifiers ) . These are further subdivided into count @-@ classifiers and mass @-@ classifiers , described below . In everyday speech , people often use the term " measure word " , or its literal Chinese equivalent 量词 liàngcí , to cover all Chinese count @-@ classifiers and mass @-@ classifiers , but the types of words grouped under this term are not all the same . Specifically , the various types of classifiers exhibit numerous differences in meaning , in the kinds of words they attach to , and in syntactic behavior . 
 Chinese has a large number of nominal classifiers ; estimates of the number in Mandarin range from " several dozen " or " about 50 " , to over 900 . The range is so large because some of these estimates include all types of classifiers while others include only count @-@ classifiers , and because the idea of what constitutes a " classifier " has changed over time . Today , regular dictionaries include 120 to 150 classifiers ; the <unk> @-@ word <unk> of Graded Words and Characters for Chinese Proficiency ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) lists 81 ; and a 2009 list compiled by Gao Ming and Barbara Malt includes 126 . The number of classifiers that are in everyday , informal use , however , may be lower : linguist Mary <unk> has claimed that about two dozen " core classifiers " account for most classifier use . As a whole , though , the classifier system is so complex that specialized classifier dictionaries have been published . 
 = = = Count @-@ classifiers and mass @-@ classifiers = = = 
 Within the set of nominal classifiers , linguists generally draw a distinction between " count @-@ classifiers " and " mass @-@ classifiers " . True count @-@ classifiers are used for naming or counting a single count noun , and have no direct translation in English ; for example , <unk> ( yì běn shū , one @-@ CL book ) can only be translated in English as " one book " or " a book " . Furthermore , count @-@ classifiers cannot be used with mass nouns : just as an English speaker cannot ordinarily say * " five muds " , a Chinese speaker cannot say * <unk> ( wǔ ge <unk> , five @-@ CL mud ) . For such mass nouns , one must use mass @-@ classifiers . 
 Mass @-@ classifiers ( true measure words ) do not pick out inherent properties of an individual noun like count @-@ classifiers do ; rather , they lump nouns into countable units . Thus , mass @-@ classifiers can generally be used with multiple types of nouns ; for example , while the mass @-@ classifier <unk> ( hé , box ) can be used to count boxes of lightbulbs ( <unk> yì hé <unk> , " one box of lightbulbs " ) or of books ( <unk> yì hé <unk> , " one box of textbooks " ) , each of these nouns must use a different count @-@ classifier when being counted by itself ( <unk> yì <unk> <unk> " one lightbulb " ; vs. <unk> yì běn <unk> " one textbook " ) . While count @-@ classifiers have no direct English translation , mass @-@ classifiers often do : phrases with count @-@ classifiers such as 一个人 ( yí ge rén , one @-@ CL person ) can only be translated as " one person " or " a person " , whereas those with mass @-@ classifiers such as 一群人 ( yì qún rén , one @-@ crowd @-@ person ) can be translated as " a crowd of people " . All languages , including English , have mass @-@ classifiers , but count @-@ classifiers are unique to certain " classifier languages " , and are not a part of English grammar apart from a few exceptional cases such as head of livestock . 
 Within the range of mass @-@ classifiers , authors have proposed subdivisions based on the manner in which a mass @-@ classifier organizes the noun into countable units . One of these is measurement units ( also called " standard measures " ) , which all languages must have in order to measure items ; this category includes units such as kilometers , liters , or pounds ( see list ) . Like other classifiers , these can also stand without a noun ; thus , for example , <unk> ( bàng , pound ) may appear as both <unk> ( sān bàng <unk> , " three pounds of meat " ) or just <unk> ( sān bàng , " three pounds " , never * <unk> sān ge bàng ) . Units of currency behave similarly : for example , <unk> ( <unk> yuán , " ten yuan " ) , which is short for ( for example ) <unk> ( <unk> yuán <unk> , " ten units of renminbi " ) . Other proposed types of mass @-@ classifiers include " collective " mass @-@ classifiers , such as 一群人 ( yì qún rén , " a crowd of people " ) , which group things less precisely ; and " container " mass @-@ classifiers which group things by containers they come in , as in <unk> ( yì <unk> <unk> , " a bowl of porridge " ) or <unk> ( yì <unk> <unk> , " a bag of sugar " ) . 
 The difference between count @-@ classifiers and mass @-@ classifiers can be described as one of quantifying versus categorizing : in other words , mass @-@ classifiers create a unit by which to measure something ( i.e. boxes , groups , chunks , pieces , etc . ) , whereas count @-@ classifiers simply name an existing item . Most words can appear with both count @-@ classifiers and mass @-@ classifiers ; for example , pizza can be described as both <unk> ( yì zhāng <unk> , " one pizza " , literally " one pie of pizza " ) , using a count @-@ classifier , and as <unk> ( yí <unk> <unk> , " one piece of pizza " ) , using a mass @-@ classifier . In addition to these semantic differences , there are differences in the grammatical behaviors of count @-@ classifiers and mass @-@ classifiers ; for example , mass @-@ classifiers may be modified by a small set of adjectives ( as in <unk> yí dà qún rén , " a big crowd of people " ) , whereas count @-@ classifiers usually may not ( for example , * <unk> yí dà ge rén is never said for " a big person " ; instead the adjective must modify the noun : <unk> yí ge dà rén ) . Another difference is that count @-@ classifiers may often be replaced by a " general " classifier 个 ( 個 ) , gè with no apparent change in meaning , whereas mass @-@ classifiers may not . <unk> Lisa Cheng and <unk> <unk> propose that count @-@ classifiers and mass @-@ classifiers have different underlying syntactic structures , with count @-@ classifiers forming " classifier phrases " , and mass @-@ classifiers being a sort of relative clause that only looks like a classifier phrase . The distinction between count @-@ classifiers and mass @-@ classifiers is often unclear , however , and other linguists have suggested that count @-@ classifiers and mass @-@ classifiers may not be fundamentally different . They posit that " count @-@ classifier " and " mass @-@ classifier " are the extremes of a continuum , with most classifiers falling somewhere in between . 
 = = = Verbal classifiers = = = 
 There is a set of " verbal classifiers " used specifically for counting the number of times an action occurs , rather than counting a number of items ; this set includes <unk> cì , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and 下 <unk> , which all roughly translate to " times " . For example , <unk> ( wǒ <unk> @-@ guo sān cì <unk> , I go @-@ PAST three @-@ CL Beijing , " I have been to Beijing three times " ) . These words can also form compound classifiers with certain nouns , as in <unk> rén cì " person @-@ time " , which can be used to count ( for example ) visitors to a museum in a year ( where visits by the same person on different occasions are counted separately ) . 
 Another type of verbal classifier indicates the tool or implement used to perform the action . An example is found in the sentence <unk> <unk> tī le wǒ yī <unk> " he kicked me " , or more literally " he kicked me one foot " . The word <unk> <unk> , which usually serves as a simple noun meaning " foot " , here functions as a verbal classifier reflecting the tool ( namely the foot ) used to perform the kicking action . 
 = = Relation to nouns = = 
 Different classifiers often correspond to different particular nouns . For example , books generally take the classifier <unk> běn , flat objects take 张 ( 張 ) zhāng , animals take <unk> ( 隻 ) zhī , machines take <unk> <unk> , large buildings and mountains take <unk> <unk> , etc . Within these categories are further subdivisions — while most animals take <unk> ( 隻 ) zhī , domestic animals take <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> , long and flexible animals take 条 ( 條 ) tiáo , and horses take 匹 pǐ . Likewise , while long things that are flexible ( such as ropes ) often take 条 ( 條 ) tiáo , long things that are rigid ( such as sticks ) take <unk> <unk> , unless they are also round ( like pens or cigarettes ) , in which case in some dialects they take <unk> zhī . Classifiers also vary in how specific they are ; some ( such as <unk> <unk> for flowers ) are generally only used with one item , whereas others ( such as 条 ( 條 ) tiáo for long and flexible things , one @-@ dimensional things , or abstract items like news reports ) are much less restricted . Furthermore , there is not a one @-@ to @-@ one relationship between nouns and classifiers : the same noun may be paired with different classifiers in different situations . The specific factors that govern which classifiers are paired with which nouns have been a subject of debate among linguists . 
 = = = Categories and prototypes = = = 
 While mass @-@ classifiers do not necessarily bear any semantic relationship to the noun with which they are used ( e.g. box and book are not related in meaning , but one can still say " a box of books " ) , count @-@ classifiers do . The precise nature of that relationship , however , is not certain , since there is so much variability in how objects may be organized and categorized by classifiers . Accounts of the semantic relationship may be grouped loosely into categorical theories , which propose that count @-@ classifiers are matched to objects solely on the basis of inherent features of those objects ( such as length or size ) , and prototypical theories , which propose that people learn to match a count @-@ classifier to a specific prototypical object and to other objects that are like that prototype . 
 The categorical , " classical " view of classifiers was that each classifier represents a category with a set of conditions ; for example , the classifier 条 ( 條 ) tiáo would represent a category defined as all objects that meet the conditions of being long , thin , and one @-@ dimensional — and nouns using that classifier must fit all the conditions with which the category is associated . Some common semantic categories into which count @-@ classifiers have been claimed to organize nouns include the categories of shape ( long , flat , or round ) , size ( large or small ) , consistency ( soft or hard ) , animacy ( human , animal , or object ) , and function ( tools , vehicles , machines , etc . ) . 
 On the other hand , proponents of prototype theory propose that count @-@ classifiers may not have innate definitions , but are associated with a noun that is prototypical of that category , and nouns that have a " family resemblance " with the prototype noun will want to use the same classifier . For example , horse in Chinese uses the classifier 匹 pǐ , as in <unk> ( sān pǐ mǎ , " three horses " ) — in modern Chinese the word 匹 has no meaning . Nevertheless , nouns denoting animals that look like horses will often also use this same classifier , and native speakers have been found to be more likely to use the classifier 匹 the closer an animal looks to a horse . Furthermore , words that do not meet the " criteria " of a semantic category may still use that category because of their association with a prototype . For example , the classifier <unk> ( <unk> ) kē is used for small round items , as in <unk> ( yì kē <unk> , " one bullet " ) ; when words like <unk> ( <unk> , " atomic bomb " ) were later introduced into the language they also used this classifier , even though they are not small and round — therefore , their classifier must have been assigned because of the words ' association with the word for bullet , which acted as a " prototype " . This is an example of " generalization " from prototypes : <unk> has proposed that when children learn count @-@ classifiers , they go through stages , first learning a classifier @-@ noun pair only ( such as <unk> tiáo <unk> , CL @-@ fish ) , then using that classifier with multiple nouns that are similar to the prototype ( such as other types of fish ) , then finally using that set of nouns to generalize a semantic feature associated with the classifier ( such as length and flexibility ) so that the classifier can then be used with new words that the person encounters . 
 Some classifier @-@ noun pairings are arbitrary , or at least appear to modern speakers to have no semantic motivation . For instance , the classifier 部 bù may be used for movies and novels , but also for cars and telephones . Some of this arbitrariness may be due to what linguist James Tai refers to as " fossilization " , whereby a count @-@ classifier loses its meaning through historical changes but remains paired with some nouns . For example , the classifier 匹 pǐ used for horses is meaningless today , but in Classical Chinese may have referred to a " team of two horses " , a pair of horse skeletons , or the pairing between man and horse . <unk> may also arise when a classifier is borrowed , along with its noun , from a dialect in which it has a clear meaning to one in which it does not . In both these cases , the use of the classifier is remembered more by association with certain " prototypical " nouns ( such as horse ) rather than by understanding of semantic categories , and thus arbitrariness has been used as an argument in favor of the prototype theory of classifiers . Gao and Malt propose that both the category and prototype theories are correct : in their conception , some classifiers constitute " well @-@ defined categories " , others make " prototype categories " , and still others are relatively arbitrary . 
 = = = Neutralization = = = 
 In addition to the numerous " specific " count @-@ classifiers described above , Chinese has a " general " classifier 个 ( 個 ) , pronounced gè in Mandarin . This classifier is used for people , some abstract concepts , and other words that do not have special classifiers ( such as <unk> <unk> " hamburger " ) , and may also be used as a replacement for a specific classifier such as 张 ( 張 ) zhāng or 条 ( 條 ) tiáo , especially in informal speech . In Mandarin Chinese , it has been noted as early as the 1940s that the use of 个 is increasing and that there is a general tendency towards replacing specific classifiers with it . Numerous studies have reported that both adults and children tend to use 个 when they do not know the appropriate count @-@ classifier , and even when they do but are speaking quickly or informally . The replacement of a specific classifier with the general 个 is known as classifier neutralization ( " <unk> " in Chinese , literally " classifier 个 @-@ <unk> " ) . This occurs especially often among children and <unk> ( individuals with damage to language @-@ relevant areas of the brain ) , although normal speakers also neutralize frequently . It has been reported that most speakers know the appropriate classifiers for the words they are using and believe , when asked , that those classifiers are obligatory , but nevertheless use 个 without even realizing it in actual speech . As a result , in everyday spoken Mandarin the general classifier is " hundreds of times more frequent " than the specialized ones . 
 Nevertheless , 个 has not completely replaced other count @-@ classifiers , and there are still many situations in which it would be inappropriate to substitute it for the required specific classifier . There may be specific patterns behind which classifier @-@ noun pairs may be " neutralized " to use the general classifier , and which may not . Specifically , words that are most prototypical for their categories , such as paper for the category of nouns taking the " flat / square " classifier 张 ( 張 ) zhāng , may be less likely to be said with a general classifier . 
 = = = Variation in usage = = = 
 It is not the case that every noun is only associated with one classifier . Across dialects and speakers there is great variability in the way classifiers are used for the same words , and speakers often do not agree which classifier is best . For example , for cars some people use 部 bù , others use <unk> <unk> , and still others use <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ; Cantonese uses <unk> <unk> . Even within a single dialect or a single speaker , the same noun may take different measure words depending on the style in which the person is speaking , or on different nuances the person wants to convey ( for instance , measure words can reflect the speaker 's judgment of or opinion about the object ) . An example of this is the word for person , 人 rén , which uses the measure word 个 ( 個 ) gè normally , but uses the measure <unk> <unk> when counting number of people in a household , and <unk> <unk> when being particularly polite or honorific , and <unk> míng in formal , written contexts ; likewise , a group of people may be referred to by <unk> as 一群人 ( yì qún rén , " a group of people " ) or <unk> ( yì <unk> rén , " a gang / crowd of people " ) : the first is neutral , whereas the second implies that the people are unruly or otherwise being judged poorly . 
 Some count @-@ classifiers may also be used with nouns that they are not normally related to , for metaphorical effect , as in <unk> ( yì <unk> <unk> , " a pile of worries / troubles " ) . Finally , a single word may have multiple count @-@ classifiers that convey different meanings altogether — in fact , the choice of a classifier can even influence the meaning of a noun . By way of illustration , <unk> sān <unk> kè means " three class periods " ( as in " I have three classes today " ) , whereas <unk> sān <unk> kè means " three courses " ( as in " I signed up for three courses this semester " ) , even though the noun in each sentence is the same . 
 = = Purpose = = 
 In research on classifier systems , and Chinese classifiers in particular , it has been asked why count @-@ classifiers ( as opposed to mass @-@ classifiers ) exist at all . Mass @-@ classifiers are present in all languages since they are the only way to " count " mass nouns that are not naturally divided into units ( as , for example , " three splotches of mud " in English ; * " three muds " is ungrammatical ) . On the other hand , count @-@ classifiers are not inherently mandatory , and are absent from most languages . Furthermore , count @-@ classifiers are used with an " unexpectedly low frequency " ; in many settings , speakers avoid specific classifiers by just using a bare noun ( without a number or demonstrative ) or using the general classifier 个 gè . Linguists and <unk> such as Joseph Greenberg have suggested that specific count @-@ classifiers are semantically " redundant " , repeating information present within the noun . Count @-@ classifiers can be used stylistically , though , and can also be used to clarify or limit a speaker 's intended meaning when using a vague or ambiguous noun ; for example , the noun <unk> kè " class " can refer to courses in a semester or specific class periods during a day , depending on whether the classifier <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> or <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> is used . 
 One proposed explanation for the existence of count @-@ classifiers is that they serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one : in other words , they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects . An alternative account is that they serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function ( a communicative function when people interact ) rather than an abstract function within the mind . Specifically , it has been proposed that count @-@ classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse , to introduce major characters or items in a story or conversation , or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and more salient . In this way , count @-@ classifiers might not serve an abstract grammatical or cognitive function , but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Classifier phrases = = = 
 Historical linguists have found that phrases consisting of nouns and numbers went through several structural changes in Old Chinese and Middle Chinese before classifiers appeared in them . The earliest forms may have been Number – Noun , like English ( i.e. " five horses " ) , and the less common Noun – Number ( " horses five " ) , both of which are attested in the oracle bone scripts of Pre @-@ Archaic Chinese ( circa 1400 BCE to 1000 BCE ) . The first constructions resembling classifier constructions were Noun – Number – Noun constructions , which were also extant in Pre @-@ Archaic Chinese but less common than Number – Noun . In these constructions , sometimes the first and second nouns were identical ( N1 – Number – N1 , as in " horses five horses " ) and other times the second noun was different , but semantically related ( N1 – Number – N2 ) . According to some historical linguists , the N2 in these constructions can be considered an early form of count @-@ classifier and has even been called an " echo classifier " ; this speculation is not universally agreed on , though . Although true count @-@ classifiers had not appeared yet , mass @-@ classifiers were common in this time , with constructions such as " wine – six – yǒu " ( the word <unk> yǒu represented a wine container ) meaning " six yǒu of wine " . Examples such as this suggest that mass @-@ classifiers predate count @-@ classifiers by several centuries , although they did not appear in the same word order as they do today . 
 It is from this type of structure that count @-@ classifiers may have arisen , originally replacing the second noun ( in structures where there was a noun rather than a mass @-@ classifier ) to yield Noun – Number – Classifier . That is to say , constructions like " horses five horses " may have been replaced by ones like " horses five CL " , possibly for stylistic reasons such as avoiding repetition . Another reason for the appearance of count @-@ classifiers may have been to avoid confusion or ambiguity that could have arisen from counting items using only mass @-@ classifiers — i.e. to clarify when one is referring to a single item and when one is referring to a measure of items . 
 Historians agree that at some point in history the order of words in this construction shifted , putting the noun at the end rather than beginning , like in the present @-@ day construction Number – Classifier – Noun . According to historical linguist Alain Peyraube , the earliest occurrences of this construction ( albeit with mass @-@ classifiers , rather than count @-@ classifiers ) appear in the late portion of Old Chinese ( 500 BCE to 200 BCE ) . At this time , the Number – Mass @-@ classifier portion of the Noun – Number – Mass @-@ classifier construction was sometimes shifted in front of the noun . Peyraube speculates that this may have occurred because it was gradually reanalyzed as a modifier ( like an adjective ) for the head noun , as opposed to a simple repetition as it originally was . Since Chinese generally places modifiers before modified , as does English , the shift may have been prompted by this reanalysis . By the early part of the Common Era , the nouns appearing in " classifier position " were beginning to lose their meaning and become true classifiers . Estimates of when classifiers underwent the most development vary : Wang Li claims their period of major development was during the Han Dynasty ( 206 BCE – 220 CE ) , whereas Liu Shiru estimates that it was the Southern and Northern Dynasties period ( 420 – 589 CE ) , and Peyraube chooses the Tang Dynasty ( 618 – 907 CE ) . Regardless of when they developed , Wang <unk> claims that they did not become grammatically mandatory until sometime around the 11th century . 
 Classifier systems in many nearby languages and language groups ( such as Vietnamese and the Tai languages ) are very similar to the Chinese classifier system in both grammatical structure and the parameters along which some objects are grouped together . Thus , there has been some debate over which language family first developed classifiers and which ones then borrowed them — or whether classifier systems were native to all these languages and developed more through repeated language contact throughout history . 
 = = = Classifier words = = = 
 Most modern count @-@ classifiers are derived from words that originally were free @-@ standing nouns in older varieties of Chinese , and have since been grammaticalized to become bound morphemes . In other words , count @-@ classifiers tend to come from words that once had specific meaning but lost it ( a process known as semantic bleaching ) . Many , however , still have related forms that work as nouns all by themselves , such as the classifier <unk> ( <unk> ) dài for long , ribbon @-@ like objects : the modern word <unk> <unk> means " ribbon " . In fact , the majority of classifiers can also be used as other parts of speech , such as nouns . Mass @-@ classifiers , on the other hand , are more transparent in meaning than count @-@ classifiers ; while the latter have some historical meaning , the former are still full @-@ fledged nouns . For example , <unk> ( <unk> , cup ) , is both a classifier as in <unk> ( yì <unk> <unk> , " a cup of tea " ) and the word for a cup as in <unk> ( <unk> , " wine glass " ) . 
 It was not always the case that every noun required a count @-@ classifier . In many historical varieties of Chinese , use of classifiers was not mandatory , and classifiers are rare in writings that have survived . Some nouns acquired classifiers earlier than others ; some of the first documented uses of classifiers were for inventorying items , both in mercantile business and in storytelling . Thus , the first nouns to have count @-@ classifiers paired with them may have been nouns that represent " culturally valued " items such as horses , scrolls , and intellectuals . The special status of such items is still apparent today : many of the classifiers that can only be paired with one or two nouns , such as 匹 pǐ for horses and <unk> <unk> for songs or poems , are the classifiers for these same " valued " items . Such classifiers make up as much as one @-@ third of the commonly used classifiers today . 
 Classifiers did not gain official recognition as a lexical category ( part of speech ) until the 20th century . The earliest modern text to discuss classifiers and their use was Ma <unk> 's 1898 Ma 's Basic Principles for Writing Clearly ( <unk> ) . From then until the 1940s , linguists such as Ma , Wang Li , and Li <unk> treated classifiers as just a type of noun that " expresses a quantity " . Lü <unk> was the first to treat them as a separate category , calling them " unit words " ( <unk> <unk> ) in his 1940s Outline of Chinese Grammar ( <unk> ) and finally " measure words " ( 量词 liàngcí ) in Grammar Studies ( <unk> ) . He made this separation based on the fact that classifiers were semantically bleached , and that they can be used directly with a number , whereas true nouns need to have a measure word added before they can be used with a number . After this time , other names were also proposed for classifiers : Gao <unk> called them " noun helper words " ( <unk> <unk> ) , Lu <unk> " counting markers " ( <unk> <unk> ) , and Japanese linguist <unk> <unk> called them " accompanying words " ( <unk> <unk> ) . In the Draft Plan for a System of Teaching Chinese Grammar ( <unk> ) adopted by the People 's Republic of China in 1954 , Lü 's " measure words " ( 量词 liàngcí ) was adopted as the official name for classifiers in China . This remains the most common term in use today . 
 = = = General classifiers = = = 
 Historically , 个 gè was not always the general classifier . Some believe it was originally a noun referring to bamboo stalks , and gradually expanded in use to become a classifier for many things with " vertical , individual , [ or ] upright <unk> [ ies ] " , eventually becoming a general classifier because it was used so frequently with common nouns . The classifier gè is actually associated with three different homophonous characters : 个 , 個 ( used today as the traditional @-@ character equivalent of 个 ) , and 箇 . Historical linguist <unk> Wang has argued that these characters actually originated from different words , and that only 箇 had the original meaning of " bamboo stalk " . 个 , she claims , was used as a general classifier early on , and may have been derived from the <unk> similar 介 jiè , one of the earliest general classifiers . 箇 later merged with 介 because they were similar in pronunciation and meaning ( both used as general classifiers ) . Likewise , she claims that 個 was also a separate word ( with a meaning having to do with " partiality " or " being a single part " ) , and merged with 个 for the same reasons as 箇 did ; she also argues that 個 was " created " , as early as the Han Dynasty , to supersede 个 . 
 Nor was 个 the only general classifier in the history of Chinese . The aforementioned 介 jiè was being used as a general classifier before the Qin Dynasty ( 221 BCE ) ; it was originally a noun referring to individual items out of a string of connected shells or clothes , and eventually came to be used as a classifier for " individual " objects ( as opposed to pairs or groups of objects ) before becoming a general classifier . Another general classifier was 枚 <unk> , which originally referred to small twigs . Since twigs were used for counting items , 枚 became a counter word : any items , including people , could be counted as " one 枚 , two 枚 " , etc . 枚 was the most common classifier in use during the Southern and Northern Dynasties period ( 420 – 589 CE ) , but today is no longer a general classifier , and is only used rarely , as a specialized classifier for items such as pins and badges . Kathleen Ahrens has claimed that 隻 ( zhī in Mandarin and <unk> in Taiwanese ) , the classifier for animals in Mandarin , is another general classifier in Taiwanese and may be becoming one in the Mandarin spoken in Taiwan . 
 = = = Variety = = = 
 Northern dialects tend to have fewer classifiers than southern ones . 個 ( ge ) is the only classifier found in the Dungan language . All nouns could have just one classifier in some dialects , such as Shanghainese , Standard Mandarin Shanxi dialect , Shandong dialects . Some dialects such as Northern Min , certain Xiang dialects , Hakka Chinese , and some Yue Chinese use 隻 for the noun referring to people , rather than 個 ( ge ) .

 Scott Philip Brown ( born September 12 , 1959 ) is an American attorney and politician . He was a United States Senator from Massachusetts , 2010 to 2013 . Prior to his term in the Senate , Brown served as a member of the Massachusetts General Court , first in the State House of Representatives ( 1998 – 2004 ) and then in the State Senate ( 2004 – 2010 ) . Brown served 35 years in the Army National Guard , retiring in 2014 with the rank of colonel . Brown is currently working as a political contributor for Fox News Channel and as an on @-@ call host for select Fox News Channel shows , including Fox & Friends . 
 Brown is a member of the Republican Party , and faced the Democratic candidate , Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley , in the 2010 special election to succeed U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy for the remainder of the term ending January 3 , 2013 . While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin , Brown saw a sudden late surge in the polls and posted a surprise win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972 . Brown ran for a full Senate term in 2012 , but lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren . He subsequently joined the board of directors of <unk> paper company , joined Fox News as a commentator , and joined Nixon Peabody where he provided legal services . 
 Prior to entering the state legislature , he had experience as a town selectman and assessor . He is a practicing attorney , with expertise in real estate law , and served as defense counsel in the Judge Advocate General 's Corps of the Massachusetts Army National Guard . Brown is a graduate of Wakefield Memorial High School ( 1977 ) , Tufts University ( 1981 ) , and Boston College Law School ( 1985 ) . 
 Brown later reestablished residence in New Hampshire , and beginning in April 2014 campaigned for the United States Senate in the 2014 election . Brown won the Republican nomination by a significant margin , but was defeated in the race by incumbent Democrat Jeanne Shaheen in the general election . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Brown is of English ancestry , from a family that has been in New Hampshire since the colonial era . His earliest American ancestor was 17th century immigrant Francis Matthews , who sailed from Devonshire , England . Brown is part of a 9th generation New Hampshire family and was born on September 12 , 1959 at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard located on Seavey 's Island in Kittery , Maine but after his parents divorced , when he was a young child , his mother moved him from Portsmouth , NH to Wakefield , Massachusetts . He often spent his summers in Newburyport , Massachusetts , where his father served as a city councilor for 18 years . He also spent summers in Portsmouth , New Hampshire during his youth . Brown 's father , Claude Bruce Brown , and mother , Judith Ann “ Judi ” ( née Rugg ) , divorced when he was about a year old . His father and his grandfather were Republicans . His father has said that young Scott became interested in running for political office in the mid @-@ 1960s while accompanying him on a campaign for state office . Brown recalls holding campaign signs for his father . 
 Brown had a difficult childhood ; after her divorce , his working mother received welfare benefits . Brown experienced sexual abuse from a camp counselor who threatened to kill the 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy if he told anyone – which he did not disclose , even to his family , until his autobiography Against All Odds ( 2011 ) – and physical abuse from his stepfathers . During various periods of his childhood , Brown lived with his grandparents and his aunt . He shoplifted many times , and was arrested for stealing record albums and brought before Judge Samuel Zoll in Salem , Massachusetts at the age of 12 . Zoll asked Brown if his siblings would like seeing him play basketball in jail and required Brown to write a 1 @,@ 500 @-@ word essay on that question as his punishment . Brown later said , " that was the last time I ever stole . " 
 He graduated from Wakefield High School in 1977 . He received a Bachelor of Arts in History , cum laude from Tufts University in 1981 and a Juris Doctor from Boston College Law School in 1985 . During his undergraduate career at Tufts , Brown was a member of the Kappa Chapter of Zeta Psi International Fraternity .

 Brown has said the rescue efforts of Army National Guard during the Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978 impressed him . He joined the Massachusetts Army National Guard when he was 19 , receiving his basic training at Fort Dix , New Jersey , and attending Reserve Officers ' Training Corps ( ROTC ) classes at the campus of Northeastern University . He was trained in infantry , quartermaster , and airborne duties , and in 1994 he joined the Judge Advocate General 's Corps ( JAG ) . He was active in the Guard for 35 years rising to the rank of colonel . As the Army National Guard 's head defense attorney in New England , Brown defended Guard members who had disciplinary difficulties such as positive drug tests , and provided estate planning and real estate advice to those who are about to deploy to war zones . He spent ten days to two weeks with the Guard in Kazakhstan and a week in Paraguay . 
 He was awarded the Army Commendation Medal for meritorious service in homeland security shortly after the September 11 attacks . He credits his military experience with causing him to focus on veteran 's issues as well as issues of war and peace . He has served on the Veterans and Federal Affairs Committee , the Hidden Wounds of War Commission , and the Governor 's Task Force on Returning Veterans during his career as a legislator . 
 On May 2 , 2011 , Brown announced that he would soon go to Afghanistan for training as part of his Army National Guard service . When deployed in August 2011 for a week of training , he spent most of his time in Kabul . 
 On August 1 , 2012 , Brown was promoted to Colonel in a private ceremony presided over by fellow senator John McCain . He officially retired from the Army on May 13 , 2014 after 35 years of service , and was awarded the Legion of Merit .

 In June 1982 , Brown , then a 22 @-@ year @-@ old law student at Boston College , won Cosmopolitan magazine 's " America 's Sexiest Man " contest . After two weeks on a crash diet of " three cans of tuna a day " and intensive workouts he was featured in the magazine 's centerfold , posing nude but strategically positioned so that according to Brown , " You don 't see anything " . In the accompanying interview , he referred to himself as " a bit of a patriot " and stated that he had political ambitions . The Cosmopolitan appearance and its $ 1 @,@ 000 fee helped pay for law school , and began for Brown a " long , lucrative " part @-@ time catalog and print modeling career in New York and Boston during the 1980s . Brown took a leave of absence from Boston College and further pursued his modeling career in New York where he was represented by Wilhelmina Models while taking classes at the Benjamin N.

 Brown " caught the political bug " in 1992 when he was elected property assessor of Wrentham , Massachusetts . In 1995 , he was elected to the Wrentham Board of <unk> . 
 He successfully ran for the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1998 , representing the 9th Norfolk District for three terms . Brown again moved up the ladder of state politics to the state Senate in March 2004 when he won a special election to replace Democrat Cheryl Jacques . Brown was re @-@ elected for a full term in November 2004 , and again in November 2006 , running without opposition the second time . He won re @-@ election in November 2008 , defeating Democratic candidate Sara Orozco by a 59 – 41 percent margin . Following his re @-@ election , Brown was one of five Republicans in the 40 @-@ seat Massachusetts Senate . In the Massachusetts Senate , Brown served on committees dealing with consumer protection , professional licensing , education , election laws , public safety , and veterans ' affairs . 
 In February 2007 , a controversy arose after Brown 's appearance at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham , Massachusetts as part of a debate on gay marriage . The high school students had launched a Facebook group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory remark about his daughter , Ayla . During his presentation , Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements they had made and announcing the names of the students who had written the statements . Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front of a high school audience . 
 In January 2010 , The Boston Globe reported that during six terms in the Legislature , three each in the House and Senate , Brown had a modest record of legislative initiatives , but he had carved out a niche as a leading advocate for veterans . Richard Tisei of Wakefield , Massachusetts , the leader of the Republican minority in the state Senate , called Brown " the acknowledged expert on veterans ' issues . " State Senator Jack Hart , a Democrat of South Boston , said : " He does his homework , he 's comprehensive in his approach , and on veterans ' issues , he 's one of them and has done a very good job on their behalf . " 
 Brown lists among his achievements as a legislator his authorship of a 2007 law that created a check @-@ off box on state income tax forms for veterans to indicate whether they served in Iraq or Afghanistan . The state uses the information to notify veterans of available services and benefits , including the Welcome Home Bonus that provides $ 1 @,@ 000 for those returning from active duty in Afghanistan or Iraq .

 On September 12 , 2009 ( his 50th birthday ) , Brown announced his run for the U.S. Senate seat that became vacant with the death of Ted Kennedy , saying the state " needs an independent thinker . " Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker said that Brown 's political positions did not fall neatly into party lines , and called Brown " mainstream in a nation that defines itself as mostly conservative . " Boris Shor , political scientist at the Harris School of Public Policy , described Brown as a liberal Republican by national standards , but well @-@ suited for his Massachusetts constituency . Shor explained the support Brown was receiving from the conservative national GOP as due to their " decentralized decision " to support the candidate most likely to win . 
 Brown won a landslide victory in the Republican primary on December 8 , 2009 , defeating late entrant and perennial candidate Jack E. Robinson by a margin of 89 percent to 11 percent . 
 Brown 's opponents in the general election were Democratic nominee , Attorney General Martha Coakley , and independent Joseph L. Kennedy ( no relation to the Kennedy family ) . At the outset , he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley , he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state , and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year 's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics . No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972 . He polled far behind Coakley for several months , but closed the gap in the early weeks of January . 
 One week before the January special election , a controversy arose over a Coakley approved television ad . The ad referenced the conscientious objector amendment Brown had sponsored for inclusion in a 2005 proposed state measure on patients ' rights . This amendment would have allowed individual healthcare workers and hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraceptive care ( the morning @-@ after pill ) to rape victims if they objected due to a religious belief . After the amendment failed , Brown did vote for the main bill which , along with other patient rights , requires healthcare workers and hospitals to provide such care . Coakley 's ad featured a male voice that said , " Brown even favors letting hospitals deny emergency contraception to rape victims , " over the ad 's graphic which had the words , " Deny care to rape victims . " Brown 's daughter Ayla called the Coakley ad " completely inaccurate and misleading " , and stated that her father would never deny care to a rape victim . Brown criticized Coakley for running what he described as attack ads . 
 In the 2010 Senate race , although Brown was not endorsed by the Greater Boston Tea Party group , the group organized a fund @-@ raising breakfast for him in Boston . The Tea Party Express also endorsed Brown and bought ads on the national cable networks supporting Brown . 
 When told that at various times he has been labeled a conservative , moderate and a liberal Republican , he responded " I 'm a Scott Brown Republican . " According to Politifact , while Brown was a Massachusetts legislator , he voted about 90 percent with the state Republican leadership ; however , Republican Leadership in the Massachusetts legislature is generally considered far more moderate than the national Republican Party . 
 A week before the general election , Brown raised $ 1 @.@ 3 million from over 16 @,@ 000 donors in a 24 @-@ hour moneybomb . His campaign office stated it raised $ 5 million over the period from January 11 – 15 . Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report stated on January 17 that he would put his " finger on the scale " for Brown as the favorite . The Rothenberg Political Report released a statement that " the combination of public and private survey research and anecdotal information now strongly suggests that Republican Scott Brown will defeat Democrat Martha Coakley in tomorrow 's race " . Suffolk University 's polling of three bellwether counties on January 18 had Brown leading Coakley by double @-@ digit margins . Brown won the January 19 election , performing well in traditional Republican strongholds and holding rival Coakley 's margins down in many Democratic precincts . 
 On election night , after Coakley conceded , Brown gave a victory speech that stated , " It all started with me , my truck , and a few dedicated volunteers . It ended with Air Force One making an emergency run to Logan . I didn 't mind when President Obama came here and criticized me – that happens in campaigns . But when he criticized my truck , that 's where I draw the line . "

 October 2011 polling showed Brown 's approvals had fallen and he faced a competitive re @-@ election if matched against Democrat Elizabeth Warren . However , his numbers in early March 2012 showed he led Warren by 8 points in the polls . In March 2012 , Brown 's lead had narrowed to 2 @.@ 3 % , within the margin of error . As of September 2012 , several polls showed Warren with a lead over Brown ( with one still giving Brown an edge ) . 
 On November 6 , 2012 , Brown was defeated by Warren in the general election . Warren was able to garner 54 % of the vote , while Brown won 46 % .

 After much anticipation by the media , Brown announced that he would run for U.S. Senate from the state of New Hampshire . Born at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery , Maine , to parents who lived near downtown Portsmouth , Brown then spent his early childhood in Portsmouth , New Hampshire and later in Wakefield , Massachusetts following his parents ' divorce . He has also been a taxpayer and owned a home in Rye , New Hampshire for more than two decades . In December 2013 , he sold his primary home in Massachusetts and expressed to the Rye town clerk " his intention to establish residency and register to vote " . 
 Polling done by various agencies in April and May 2014 showed incumbent Senator Jeanne Shaheen leading Brown by 3 to 5 points . A poll conducted in May by the Republican Governors Association showed Brown leading Jeanne Shaheen by 5 points . In late August , a WMUR / <unk> poll showed Shaheen leading Brown by two points , 46 to 44 . Polling in the final few weeks of the election suggested Brown had pulled ahead of Shaheen , with weekly polls by NH1 News , New England College , and Vox Populi showing Brown leading by a margin of 1 – 4 percentage points for the three consecutive weeks leading up to the election . 
 There were five total debates during the election , three of which were televised . The televised U.S. Senate Debates , were hosted by WMUR @-@ TV , <unk> , and NH1 News . The WMUR Debate was moderated by George Stephanopoulos of ABC and Josh <unk> of WMUR @-@ TV and was held at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown . The NH1 News Debate was moderated by Wolf Blitzer of CNN and Paul <unk> of NH1 and was held at the NH1 Media Center in Concord .

 Brown was sworn in to office on February 4 , 2010 , by Vice President Joe Biden , in his capacity as President of the Senate , on the floor of the Senate . As a Class I Senator , his term lasted until January 3 , 2013 . 
 Brown was among the speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) in Washington , D.C. , introducing former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney . Despite his appearance at CPAC , where he alluded to his election as making " big government spenders ... [ not ] feel good at all " , Brown refused to rule out a vote for a Democratic " jobs bill " proposal , and has praised both Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and former senior Senator and current Secretary of State John Kerry of Massachusetts for indicating their willingness to work with him across party lines . Brown was one of five Republican senators to vote for cloture on the jobs bill . The motion passed in the Senate 62 – 30 on February 22 , 2010 . In an up or down vote on the bill itself on February 24 , 2010 , Brown voted for final passage , helping to pass the bill 70 – 28 .

 Brown 's views on the 2011 budget cuts and his departures from GOP consensus placed him at odds with some of his fellow Republicans and prominent Tea Party conservatives , including Glenn Beck . He said he opposed these measures because he believed that they would have a negative impact on low income families and children . 
 In late June 2010 , Brown was ranked as " the most popular officeholder in Massachusetts " according to a poll conducted by the Boston Globe . 55 % of those polled had favorable opinions of Brown nearly five months after his January 19 , 2010 , special election victory to finish the term of the late Senator Edward Kennedy . 50 % of respondents generally approved of how Brown had handled his new position . 
 On March 30 , 2011 , the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee released a poll showing that Brown remained the " most popular politician in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , with an approval rating of 73 percent . " Brown 's " ' re @-@ elect ' score was comfortably above 50 percent , which is unusual for a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic state . "

" 
 On December 12 , 2010 , The Boston Globe reported that " [ c ] <unk> contributions to [ Brown ] from the financial industry spiked sharply during a critical three @-@ week period last summer as the fate of the Wall Street regulatory overhaul hung in the balance and Brown used the leverage of his swing vote to win key concessions sought by firms .

He has stated this plan is fiscally unsound , and during his campaign notably pledged to be the 41st vote to filibuster the bill in the Senate . 
 Brown voted for a state measure on patients ' rights that , among other provisions , requires emergency rooms to provide what is known as the morning @-@ after pill to rape victims to prevent an unwanted pregnancy from developing . In consideration of health care workers who might have a religious objection to administering this medication , Brown attached what became known as the Conscientious <unk> amendment which would have exempted these workers , as well as religious hospitals , from being required to provide this medication . However , Brown 's amendment also required that all hospitals still had to provide a means for the patient to receive the medication , either by providing another healthcare worker willing to administer the medication , or , in the case of religious hospitals , to provide transportation to another facility , and in a timely manner . The amendment did not pass .

 " Piece of Me " is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her fifth studio album , Blackout ( 2007 ) . It was released on November 27 , 2007 by Jive Records as the second single from the album . The song was written and produced by Swedish producers Bloodshy & Avant and Klas Åhlund as a response to the media scrutiny and sensationalism of Spears ' private life , which they had seen by working with her over the years . " Piece of Me " was the last song to be recorded for Blackout . The self @-@ manifesto song 's lyrics are written like a biography retelling her mishaps . Musically , " Piece of Me " is an electro song that runs through a down @-@ tempo dance beat . Spears ' voice is heavily synthesized , and constantly shifts in pitch . Backing vocals are provided by Bloodshy and Avant and Robyn . 
 Most music critics cited it as one of the highlights from Blackout . Rolling Stone ranked the song at number fifteen on their list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007 .

In the United States , it became the second single from the album to have peaked at the top of the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart . 
 The music video , directed by Wayne Isham , portrayed Spears ' life at the time and showed her with her friends disguising themselves in order to confuse the paparazzi . Isham 's concept was to have Spears confidently parodying her situation . It received mixed reviews from critics , most arguing her body was digitally altered . The video was nominated in three categories at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards and won all of them , including Video of the Year . " Piece of Me " was performed at The Circus Starring Britney Spears ( 2009 ) and the Femme Fatale Tour ( 2011 ) .

While recording with Spears over the years , Karlsson and Winnberg often saw first @-@ hand how her regular activities were interrupted by the paparazzi , including one experience in Hamburg which Winnberg deemed as " really scary " . For Blackout , Spears worked with them on " Radar " , " Freakshow " and " Toy Soldier " . When the album was considered to be finished , Bloodshy & Avant were persuaded by her A & R Teresa LaBarbera Whites to work on a new track . Winnberg commented that it had always been an unwritten rule not to write songs about Spears ' personal life since the label rejected " Sweet Dreams My LA Ex " , a response track to Justin Timberlake 's " Cry Me a River " . However , the duo wrote " Piece of Me " with Åhlund and sent it to Spears , who loved it . Bloodshy & Avant worked on the track at Bloodshy & Avant Studios in Stockholm , Sweden , and Spears recorded her vocals at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles , California . Winnberg stated that Spears was extremely psyched when she came to the studio , where she recorded the song in about half an hour as she had learned the lyrics by heart in her car . " Piece of Me " was later mixed by Niklas Flyckt at <unk> Studios in Stockholm . On October 31 , 2007 , during a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest , Spears talked about the song , saying , 
 " Wherever you go , there 's a lot of people who ask questions , and sometimes you don 't know their intentions and stuff like that . So , it is kind of a cute way of putting it out there . You know , like , ' You want a piece of me ? ' , you know , in a cool , cute and clever way . It is a cute song [ ... ] I like it " .

 " Piece of Me " is described as being backed by a " electro instrumental track " and performed in an insistent pop groove .

They are heavily synthesized and are constantly pitch @-@ shifted . The track consists of over @-@ the @-@ top vocal distortions , causing a split sound effect , making it difficult to discern which voice is Spears ' .

" during the chorus and writer Klas Åhlund sings the repeated " piece of me " line in a <unk> voice . Dave De Sylvia of Sputnikmusic drew comparisons to the songs in Robyn 's Robyn ( 2005 ) , specifically to her single " Handle Me " . 
 The lyrics of " Piece of Me " are written as a reaction to the scrutiny of Spears ' private life in the media . They deal with fame and living under the spotlight . During the first verse , Spears sings the hookline " You want a piece of me ? " , that is repeated throughout the song . According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times , the line " could be an accusation or an invitation or a threat " . " Piece of Me " is constructed in the common verse @-@ chorus pattern . " Piece of Me " is written like a biography retelling Spears ' mishaps , sung in a nearly spoken manner . Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy compared the lyrics to Amy Winehouse 's " Rehab " ( 2006 ) . Bill Lamb of About.com said that " Piece of Me " makes Michael Jackson 's " Scream " ( 1995 ) " sound like a whimper . "

 Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy gave " Piece of Me " four stars , calling it " a two fingered @-@ salute to the media hounds and an electro @-@ thudding cry of defiance , warning us that this <unk> is not for turning .

Peter Robinson of The Observer and Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly named " Piece of Me " one of the standout tracks of the album . Dennis Lim of Blender called it one of the best tracks of Blackout along with " Gimme More " . Laura Herbert of BBC News said that the song is " without doubt the best track on the whole album . [ ... ] It 's a masterpiece . " Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said " [ Bloodshy & Avant ] evoke the horror , the exhilaration and ( finally ) the boredom of [ Spears ' ] <unk> life . It ’ s brilliant " . 
 Tom Ewing of Pitchfork Media suggested that " the <unk> of the voice , the way it edges into the music , suggests that the price of fame is identity erasure . We understand her through a filter , and that 's how we have to hear her too . The multiple backing vox fragment identity further , turn the song more universal " . Dave De Sylvia of Sputnikmusic also picked it as one of the album 's highlights . Melissa Maerz of Rolling Stone named it the best track of the album along with " Freakshow " , deeming it as a " tabloid @-@ bashing banger " . Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel said that " Musically , songs such as ' Piece of Me , ' ' Radar ' and ' Break the Ice ' are one @-@ dimensional , robotic exercises . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that " Bloodshy & Avant try desperately to craft a defiant anthem for this tabloid fixture , as she couldn 't be bothered to write one on her own " . Chris Wasser from the Irish Independent said the song " drowns slowly under <unk> production and a lyrical theme that for all of its close connection with the trials and tribulations Spears has had to deal with , weren 't even penned by the singer who could have very easily recorded her fairly unchallenging input on Blackout in less than a week . " The song was later included in Rolling Stone 's 100 Best Songs of 2007 at number fifteen .

 The music video for " Piece of Me " was filmed on November 27 and November 28 , 2007 , at the nightclub and restaurant Social Hollywood in Los Angeles , California . It was directed by Wayne Isham , who had previously worked with Spears in the music video of " I 'm Not a Girl , Not Yet a Woman " . British national newspaper Daily Mail reported that the video cost $ 500 @,@ 000 , her most expensive music video since the music video for " Toxic " . In some scenes of the music video , Spears wore a purple satin dress from American designer Marina <unk> . Spears reportedly arrived twelve hours late to the set , after spending the day with her sons Sean Preston and Jayden James . Isham talked about the situation , saying , " She was late . People made a big thing about it , [ but ] how could she not be late , when you have 50 , 65 , 75 people running down the street chasing her car ? That was a long day for the crew . It was literally a 20 @-@ hour day for the crew . She was there for the last six hours of it . She got there late , showed up and just kicked ass " . He also explained the concept of the music video : 
 " On [ the music video ] , I really just wanted to put the mirror back onto the whole experience . You can see that she had that kind of confidence . And , literally , every take became a more and more confident take , so that she could have fun with what was going on . Not being over @-@ the @-@ top sarcastic , but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her , with confidence . [ ... ] The very last dance of the piece , she had her hair up , and I go , ' Can you just do one for me with your hair down ? ' She dropped her hair down . You 'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down . That was the last piece . She just rocked it from her heart . She choreographed that last dance at the very end . She did that on her own and said , ' Let 's go for it ' " .

Spears appears in front of a multi @-@ colored , illuminated background wearing a short brown fur vest , a sequined black bra and ripped low @-@ rise jeans . There are also intercut scenes of Spears wearing a white fur vest tearing down tabloid covers such as In Touch Weekly and creating positive ones , such as " It 's Britney , Bitch " and " Exceptional <unk> " . One tabloid in particular is labeled " Rats Weakly " , likely a pun of Star ( magazine ) when written backwards . During the first chorus , Spears joins the four women , all wearing matching blond bob wigs , dark sunglasses and black trench coats being hounded by paparazzi . 
 Then they enter a nightclub , with Spears wearing a purple satin dress . Spears starts flirting with a man and guides him into the women 's bathroom , where she discovers he has a hidden camera in his chest . She writes " Sucker " in his forehead .

The final scene shows a close @-@ up of Spears smirking .

Aguilera listened to a lot of electronic music during her pregnancy , and she was inspired to include the genre on Bionic . 
 Aguilera originally considered servicing the track " Glam " as the lead single from Bionic . However , after the conclusion of a day @-@ long countdown on her website on March 23 , 2010 , it was announced that " Not Myself Tonight " would be released as the official lead single instead . The single cover was simultaneously released , featuring a black @-@ and @-@ white image depicting Aguilera as a devil , dressed in a black leather suit with devil ears and a tail .

 = = Composition = = 
 " Not Myself Tonight " is an uptempo electropop and electro @-@ R & B song , which incorporates elements from tribal house . Written in the key of G minor , it has a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute . Aguilera 's vocals on the track span from the low @-@ note of G3 to the high @-@ note of D5 . Aguilera opted to explore and create a " fresh , sexy feel using both electronic and organic elements with subject matter ranging from playful to introspective " in the track ; the track features " dripping " synthesizers , " pulsing " basslines and house drums in its instrumentation . Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine compared " Not Myself Tonight " to Britney Spears songs " Gimme More " and " If U Seek Amy " for having similar musical style . 
 Lyrically , " Not Myself Tonight " talks about Aguilera adopting a new persona and new musical experiments . At the beginning , Aguilera admits that " Tonight I 'm feeling a little out of control " . At the pre @-@ chorus , she sings " The old me 's gone and I feel brand new , and if you don 't like it , fuck you " , which takes aim at anyone who dismisses her new style ; meanwhile , she declares her musical departure from her previous 1940s and 1950s inspired album Back to Basics ( 2006 ) at the chorus with the line , " I 'm not myself tonight , tonight I 'm not the same girl " .

 Upon its release , " Not Myself Tonight " received mixed critical reception . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic picked " Not Myself Tonight " as one of the highlights from Bionic , while Michael Menachem from Billboard complimented Aguilera 's vocal delivery and suggested that the track proved that " the current dance @-@ pop craze would be incomplete without [ Aguilera ] " . Digital Spy editor Nick Levine gave the single a four out of five stars rating , writing that " on first listen , it feels a bit too ordinary to be trailing such a potentially audacious long @-@ player . However , after a few spins it becomes clear that this is far from a flop " . Sarah @-@ Louise James from the UK Daily Star lauded the musical style of " Not Myself Tonight " but opined that it was overshadowed by the accompanying S & M @-@ inspired music video . On a negative side , Mesfin Fekadu from The Boston Globe mockingly described the single as " mediocre at best . " 
 Fraser McAlpine writing for BBC Music praised the song 's composition yet criticized its lyrics for " [ not ] escaping the feeling that she 's only getting up in our collective grill once again with the sexy and the [ <unk> ] ' tude " . Gavin Martin from the Daily Mirror wrote that " Not Myself Tonight " " shows the post @-@ natal Aguilera has pumped up her sex appeal . And , although her top @-@ shelf strategy is hardly startling in its originality , it 's accomplished with more class than her obvious competitors " . On behalf of The Village Voice , Drew Hinshaw criticized Aguilera 's vocals and lyrics on the song . Likewise , Dan Martin from NME opined that with the new musical style of Bionic and its lead single , Aguilera had very little chance to explore her vocal ability . Writing for Drowned in Sound , Richard Wink concerned that " Not Myself Tonight " showcased an " apparent identity crisis " that Aguilera experienced during the production of Bionic ; he questioned whether the alter ego " Xtina " was " the character that represents a freewheeling , risk taking , carefree party girl " or the contrasting " mask a desperate popstar wears when they are struggling to maintain relevance " .

 The music video for " Not Myself Tonight " was filmed from April 7 to April 9 , 2010 in Los Angeles , directed by Hype Williams . It officially premiered on Vevo on April 30 , 2010 . On working with Williams and the new looks she developed in the video , Aguilera stated , " ... someone with that much of a catalog under his belt and success as a video maker , he 's like a legend . So again entering into the collaborating factor , I didn 't know what to expect ... and he 's probably thinking the same about me . And when we walked away from working with each other , it was just a love connection . I wanted to maintain and keep consistent with the look of the album packaging and book , and I really wanted to keep all that in line , and so he really paid attention , and I think it 's really iconic and classic . We totally made magic together on a creative level , it was absolutely amazing . He really got in and listened to where my music was at " . 
 Aguilera revealed that some of the inspiration for the music video came from her work in Burlesque , stating , " There is dancing , and I learned so much also as a dancer doing the ' Burlesque ' film , moving my body in ways that were , I feel , never as precise before [ ... ] I really fell in love and I adapted that in the dancing for ' Not Myself Tonight , ' but it was really , really fun to take what I learned from the movie . " She further elaborated , " A lot of that [ video ] was based on my visual inspiration . I took Hype into my salon area in my home ... it 's like my creative den . He took the ideas and then took other ideas and related to the ideas , and it just was really iconic imagery . " The video itself features a strong sexual theme with scenes of S & M and bondage , as well as scenes in a church and several prestigious @-@ looking buildings . Aguilera wore several hairstyles and outfits , including many which were dominatrix @-@ style . 
 According to Aguilera , the music video of " Not Myself Tonight " is a tribute to Madonna , citing her music videos as its major influence , most notably " Express Yourself " ( 1989 ) . She viewed the visual for " Express Yourself " as " really strong and empowering which [ she ] always try to incorporate through my expression of sexuality . " Several critics further noted that the S & M @-@ inspired theme of the music video for " Not Myself Tonight " was also resembled other Madonna music videos such as " Human Nature " and " Like a Prayer " . MTV News ' Gil Kaufman also opined that Aguilera recalled her " Dirrty " video for sharing the same sexual depiction . 
 James Montgomery of MTV News called the video " jaw @-@ dropping " . Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly commented that the video was similar to visuals by Lady Gaga and Madonna , further noting that Aguilera " did indeed seem desperate " in the " unoriginal " clip , saying that " maybe she should have gone in a totally different direction to avoid comparisons " . On behalf of Rolling Stone , Daniel Kreps stated that " Aguilera assumes no less than a dozen different guises , all scantily clad , ranging from carbon copies of Lady Gaga ( borrowing heavily from her unique wardrobe ) , Madonna , Beyoncé , Gwen Stefani , the girls from Robert Palmer 's " Simply Irresistible " video and Michelle Pfeiffer 's S & M @-@ inspired Catwoman from Batman Returns . Despite the video 's attempt to shock , it 's unlikely Aguilera will ever out @-@ Gaga Gaga or out @-@ controversy Madonna . ... Hopefully next time she steps in front of the lens she 'll be more herself and less like everyone else " . NME ranked the " Not Myself Tonight " music video at number 8 on its list of the " 50 Worst Music Videos Ever " .

 Space Station Silicon Valley is a platform video game developed by DMA Design and published by Take @-@ Two Interactive . It was originally released for the Nintendo 64 in October 1998 , and was ported for the Game Boy Color in 1999 , and for the PlayStation in 2000 under the name Evo 's Space Adventures . Players control Evo , a robot reduced to a crawling microchip after a ship crash , and are tasked with taking control of animals to solve puzzles and defeat enemies . 
 The game began development in September 1995 , as part of a publishing deal with BMG Interactive . When this deal fell through , the development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64 , which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing . The hardware also shaped the game 's humour and style , with a soft focus look leading to a style akin to Plasticine models . The game 's distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games . Similarly , the game 's music was created to resemble B movies . 
 Upon release , Space Station Silicon Valley was acclaimed by many reviewers , with praise particularly directed at the intuitive mechanics , innovative level design , and comical concepts . It won numerous awards , including Game of the Month and Most Innovative Game from IGN . Despite this , the game performed poorly commercially , and was unable to secure enough sales to warrant a sequel . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Space Station Silicon Valley is a platform game that is viewed from a third @-@ person perspective . Players traverse several different environments to advance through the game . During the game , players control Evo — a robot who is reduced to a crawling microchip during a ship crash , and is losing energy at a steady rate without protection . In order to survive , players attack animals , which disables them and allows players to assume control of their bodies . Each animal possesses different characteristics , including survival rate and special attacks , and uses different abilities ; for example , large animals such as bears are able to destroy ice blocks , which other animals are incapable of doing so . Some animals are also unable to survive in certain unfamiliar environments , forcing players to enter the body of another . The animals are used to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in each level , collecting Evo 's power cells to maintain energy . 
 During the game , players are frequently accompanied by the voice of Dan Danger , a human who is trapped in the destroyed spaceship . Dan assigns missions to players , occasionally commenting on their performance . The game is set on a space station — the titular Silicon Valley , which consists of four environments : Euro Eden , Arctic Kingdom , Jungle Safari , and Desert Adventure . The environments are unlocked as players progress through the game . Each environment consists of numerous sub @-@ levels , ranging from six to ten , each of which task players with certain objectives ; examples include activating switches , disabling electric fences , and gathering a set amount of objects . As players progress through the levels , they collect the scattered remains of Evo 's protective shell suit , eventually re @-@ assembling them for the final level . Each level also contains a hidden objective , such as collecting a souvenir or making an animal perform a certain act ; as players complete the hidden objectives , they are rewarded with a gold trophy , and collecting all trophies unlocks a bonus level . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the year 2001 , the space station Silicon Valley was launched , housing numerous animals . Seven minutes after its launch , it vanished . Believed to have disappeared forever , it reappears in the year 3000 , and the many expeditions sent to retrieve the space station vanished without explanation . Following this , the duo of Dan Danger and Evo were sent to investigate ; they discover that the animal cargo has evolved and merged with the station 's technology , resulting in animals such as an electronically @-@ powered fox with motorised wheels , and a steam @-@ powered hippopotamus . Evo sets out to fix the control station , which is on a collision course with Earth . Upon arriving at the control room , Evo confronts the Evil Brain , who is fascinated by Evo 's abilities and wants to keep him to complete the collection of robotic animals . The Evil Brain threatens to destroy the Earth , but is quickly defeated by Evo . Despite this , Evo is unable to stop the space station from spinning out of control ; it collides with Earth , landing in New York Harbor . The robotic animals escape and flee around New York City , and Evo sets out to terminate them before they terrorise the planet .

 Space Station Silicon Valley began development in September 1995 , as part of a three @-@ game publishing deal between developer DMA Design and BMG Interactive , the other games being Grand Theft Auto ( 1997 ) and <unk> ( 1998 ) . All three games were planned to be released on Microsoft Windows , PlayStation and Sega Saturn , as they were the most popular platforms at the time . Following Take @-@ Two Interactive 's acquisition of BMG Interactive in March 1998 , Take @-@ Two acquired the publishing rights to the game , and the team instead changed focus to develop the game for the Nintendo 64 , upon discovering that Windows was incapable of processing the models and environments intended for use . Every member of the team that developed Space Station Silicon Valley began working at DMA Design at the beginning of development , in September 1995 . Development began using the new DirectX libraries , following the release of Windows 95 . The levels were designed and edited using Silicon Graphics computers , which were transferred directly to the Nintendo 64 development boards . The team found the Nintendo 64 to be more advanced than previous hardware ; programmer Grant <unk> described the development kits as " the most powerful hardware available in the building " . 
 The game 's humour and style was shaped by hardware limitations ; when the hardware rendered the character models in soft focus , the team noted that they resembled Plasticine models , and continued to create the game with a look and style akin to Wallace and Gromit . The game was presented with " distinctive ' British ' humour " to distinguish from other games ; lead programmer Leslie Benzies and artist Aaron Garbut often presented the team with other Nintendo 64 games , such as Super Mario 64 ( 1996 ) , to identify the differences . The team ensured that each level felt distinct , while maintaining a coherent style . This diversity was achieved using the development tools , which allowed various members of the team to experiment in creating designs . Manual text writer Brian Baglow said that the game 's music provided freedom to the team , as it " doesn 't necessarily have to fit the action on the screen " . He explained that the audio was designed to fit with the " cheesy , slightly twisted B @-@ movies animation kind of feel " . Baglow found that creating the music on a cartridge instead of a CD prompted the team to discover new techniques of working within the boundaries of the former , stating that " people who are doing music for CD @-@ based systems get very , very lazy " . 
 While similar body @-@ swapping games already existed , such as <unk> ( 1985 ) , they had little influence on the development of Space Station Silicon Valley . The team were instead influenced by other games in development at DMA , including Grand Theft Auto and Body Harvest ( 1998 ) . Unlike those games , Space Station Silicon Valley does not take place in an open world ; " they 're a bugger to make , " explained creative director Gary Penn . The objective of the team was to create a game where players were encouraged to try new things to see the outcome . The original concept for the game was that players would eat robots and become increasingly larger , retrospectively described by creative director lead artist Jamie Bryan as being similar to <unk> : Survival of the Fittest ( 2002 ) . Another early idea was for the in @-@ game animals to consist of different parts , and destroying one animal would allow players to swap some features with their existing body ; this was quickly discarded , as the team realised it would require extensive testing . 
 The game was developed with little interference from upper management ; programmer <unk> <unk> said that " only after 18 months was there a push to get everything together into a finished game " . Space Station Silicon Valley entered beta in August 1998 , and was first released for Nintendo 64 on October 21 , 1998 . Baglow attributed the lengthy development cycle to the scale of the game , stating that " it 's got to be fun " . A Game Boy Color version of the game — a 2D remake of the original version — was released in Europe in late 1999 ; IGN 's Tim Jones was critical of the port , criticising the gameplay and level design . The game was also ported to the PlayStation by Runecraft in June 2000 , under the title Evo 's Space Adventures , although the original development team had little input besides providing the models , codes and textures ; a review by JeuxVideo.com criticised the port 's poor gameplay and graphics , and it has elsewhere been described as " one of the laziest ports in the history of video games " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Space Station Silicon Valley was well received by critics . Review aggregator Metacritic calculated an average score of 83 out of 100 based on 10 reviews , for the Nintendo 64 version . Metacritic ranks the game within the top 10 Nintendo 64 games released in 1998 . Praise was particularly directed at the game 's intuitive mechanics , innovative level design , and comical concepts . The game was also applauded for the originality of its concept ; IGN 's Matt Casamassina called Space Station Silicon Valley " maybe the most original game to hit Nintendo 64 " , and Next Generation named it " one of the very best Nintendo 64 has to offer " . 
 Critics lauded the gameplay . Casamassina of IGN called it " nearly flawless " , while Next Generation named it " a satisfying challenge " . A reviewer from Game Revolution noted that the game " keeps the emphasis on gameplay " , particularly appreciating the attention to detail , however noted inconveniences in the camera . Lauren Fielder of GameSpot felt that the game 's puzzles were very simple to decipher , but noted that the game accomplishes its goal of entertaining and amusing players . Andrew Reiner of Game Informer found the game " monotonous " , and the missions to be " immensely boring " . 
 A reviewer for Next Generation named the level design " superb " , praising the variety and open @-@ ended approach of the levels . Dan Hsu of Electronic Gaming Monthly echoed similar remarks , applauding the game 's preparation for contingencies , and Daily Radar 's Max Everingham described the levels as " innovative " . Game Revolution disliked the inability to save the game mid @-@ level , but otherwise appreciated the variety of the levels , while a reviewer for Game Informer found the levels to be " fairly small " . 
 Game Revolution wrote that the game has " some of the best sound yet " for a Nintendo 64 game , praising the variety of the musical tracks . IGN 's Casamassina found the music " very well executed " and " very entertaining " , likening it to " ' futuristic space pop ' and elevator @-@ like tunes " , and named the sound effects " equally satisfying " . Conversely , Electronic Gaming Monthly 's Hsu found the music " ultra @-@ annoying " . For the PlayStation version of the game , in which the original music is replaced , John Szczepaniak of Hardcore Gaming 101 said that it " sucks " , writing that " the elevator style music is made even more obnoxious , and some of the really good tunes ... have been replaced with awful generic heavy metal " . 
 IGN 's Casamassina found that the game " lacks the graphic finesse of a title like Banjo @-@ Kazooie " , but praised it nonetheless , while GameSpot 's Lauren Fielder called the graphics " nothing special " . Game Revolution praised the graphics , particularly applauding the smooth textures and vibrant colour palette , as well as the detail of the character movement . Next Generation felt that the game " doesn 't push Nintendo 64 's hardware to the limits " , and noted some occasional frame rate slowdown , but appreciated the " cute " and simplistic design . Jon Storm of Game Informer called the graphics " lame " , criticising the lack of detail in the environments and characters . In a retrospective feature , Craig Owens of Nintendo Gamer wrote that the game 's " chunky , angular " art style conveys the " experimental , unpredictable tone " . 
 Electronic Gaming Monthly presented Space Station Silicon Monthly the Silver Editor 's Choice Award . It was named IGN 's Game of the Month for October 1998 , and in February 1999 it won Most Innovative Game from IGN , who praised it for capturing " old @-@ school " gameplay mechanics . In January 2007 , IGN placed the game fifth on a list of " Underrated and Underappreciated Games " , and in April 2009 placed it on a list of " Nintendo 64 Treasures " , stating that it " remains one of the great unsung heroes " of the console . Despite its critical success , the game failed to match expected sales , and was unable to earn enough money to warrant a sequel . The team attributed the poor commercial performance to the game 's simultaneous launch with The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time , which was Nintendo 's marketing focus at the time .

He is introduced in the second season episode " Adrift " as one of the plane @-@ crash survivors from the plane 's tail section . Flashbacks reveal that he became the leader of a gang of guerrillas to save his brother when he still lived in Nigeria . He assumed his brother 's identity and became a priest after his brother was killed in a botched drug smuggle ; Eko killed two guerrillas in defense , was ostracized , and left Nigeria to become a priest in Australia . After investigating the alleged miracle of a girl who came back to life after drowning in Australia in 2004 , Eko boarded Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 . This plane crashed and left Eko , along with a few other survivors , on a deserted island . 
 Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse were fans of Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje 's work on HBO 's Oz , and asked him to portray the character . Although Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje was not initially interested in joining the cast , he was persuaded by Cuse and Lindelof , but for a shorter period than they had in mind . Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje had a lot of influence on his character , changing the character 's name and making adjustments to Eko 's personality . After appearing on the show for one season , Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje asked Cuse and Lindelof to write his character out of the show because he did not feel at home in Hawaii . They decided a " shocking and emotional death " would be the best way for the character to depart : after seeing his brother on the island , Eko chases him until he stumbles upon the smoke monster , which brutally murders him . 
 Mr. Eko received many positive responses from critics and fans , who were disappointed that the character was killed after one season . A toy figure of Mr. Eko was included in a second series of Lost toy figures distributed by McFarlane Toys .

 Originally from Nigeria , Mr. Eko was born on January 31 , 1968 . He grew up always looking after his younger brother , Yemi ( Adetokumboh M 'Cormack ) , with whom he lived in a small village . As revealed in " The 23rd Psalm " , one day , when Eko is playing with the local children , a gang of guerrillas raids the village in search of young recruits . When Yemi refuses to shoot an elderly man , Eko steps in and shoots him himself , sparing Yemi from the same fate . Impressed by his actions , the guerrillas take Eko away with them and draw him away from his religious lifestyle and into the criminal life , where Eko adopted the title " Mr. " He grows up to be a fearless drug lord and a vicious leader of a guerrilla group , while his brother becomes an honoured priest . Years after his abduction , Eko returns to his home village to ask Yemi to help him smuggle heroin , which Eko has hidden in a large number of Virgin Mary statues and intends to fly out of the country . Yemi refuses until Eko threatens his associates will burn the church down if he does not sign documents that allow him and his henchmen to appear as priests . 
 As Eko and his men assemble at the airfield on the day the shipment is ready to be smuggled , it is revealed Yemi has tipped off the military and now tries to convince Eko not to go through with his plans . When the military arrives , Yemi is killed in the ensuing gun battle and Eko is kicked off the plane . After the plane leaves , Eko is mistaken for Yemi and released back to his village . Feeling guilty over Yemi 's death , Eko assumes his role as the village priest . One day , Eko encounters a gang of guerrillas who made a deal with Yemi : they 'll take 80 % of the vaccines delivered to the village in exchange for the village 's safety . Soon afterward , the guerrillas arrive at the church and attempt to cut off Eko 's hands . However , Eko fights back and kills them , much to the shock of the village . The church is thus boarded up and Eko is ostracized until he leaves for London . 
 After leaving England , Eko assumes his brother 's identity , serving as a priest in Australia under the name Father <unk> . A monsignor asks him to investigate a reported miracle of a young lady who has come back to life after drowning . The girl 's father , Richard Malkin , dismisses the miracle as an act of incompetence by the undertaker , claiming the girl was suffering from severe hypothermia and the doctor misdiagnosed her as a result . Eko soon prepares to board Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 ; shortly after buying a ticket , he encounters the girl whom the investigation is about . She tells Eko she saw Yemi as she was " between places " , and his brother had a message for him to have faith .

 After the crash , Eko lands with the tail @-@ section survivors in the ocean , a short distance from the beach . On the group 's first night on the island , the Others kidnap a few of the survivors . Eko kills two of them while resisting a kidnap attempt ; feeling guilty , Eko remains mute for the following forty days . In " Adrift " , Eko beats Jin @-@ Soo Kwon ( Daniel Dae Kim ) , James " Sawyer " Ford ( Josh Holloway ) , and Michael Dawson ( Harold Perrineau ) unconscious when they arrive on their beach and hauls them into a pit . When their innocence is proven , Eko and the tail @-@ section survivors head to the camp of the other fuselage survivors . After their arrival in " What Kate Did " , John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) shows Eko an orientation video from the DHARMA Initiative . Eko watches it and fits in with the remaining fuselage survivors . 
 In " The 23rd Psalm " , Eko discovers a Virgin Mary statue in Charlie Pace 's ( Dominic Monaghan ) possession and he demands to be taken to the Beechcraft where it came from , knowing his brother 's body is there . Eko and Charlie decide to burn the plane along with all the heroin @-@ filled statues . On his fiftieth day on the island , Eko baptizes baby Aaron and his mother Claire Littleton ( Emilie De Ravin ) . As he discovers the survivors hold one of the others named " Henry Gale " ( Michael Emerson ) captured in the Swan hatch , he requests to speak him . Eko confesses to him about killing two people on the first night of the crash and expresses his condolences before leaving . Following his confession , Eko starts building a church down the beach with Charlie 's help . However , after Ana Lucia Cortez ( Michelle Rodriguez ) and Yemi tell him to help Locke in a dream in " ? " , Eko abandons the church and ventures into the jungle with Locke , claiming to hunt down the escaped " Henry Gale " . Eko manages to coax Locke into taking him to the " ? " he drew on a map , resulting in the discovery of the Pearl station . After watching the station 's orientation video , Eko vows to continue pushing the button in the hatch , despite Locke 's protests . In the season 2 finale " Live Together , Die Alone " , Locke and Desmond Hume ( Henry Ian Cusick ) initiate a lockdown and lock Eko out of the computer room . Desperate not to let the timer run out , Eko goes to the stash of dynamite from the Black Rock , a ship which wrecked on the island before the plane . Eko 's attempt to blow open the blast door has no effect except to knock him unconscious , and he is thus unable to prevent the timer 's reaching zero . As a result , the station implodes . 
 Although Eko survives the implosion , he is dragged away by a polar bear . Locke and Charlie later rescue him and pull him to safety . In " The Cost of Living " , Eko awakens to find Yemi in his tent , telling him he needs to confess before finding his tent is on fire . Searching for Yemi , he soon decides to follow Locke , Desmond , Sayid Jarrah ( Naveen Andrews ) , Nikki and Paulo ( Kiele Sanchez , and Rodrigo Santoro ) to the Pearl station . While waiting outside , he sees Yemi again , and follows the apparition to give his confession . Upon learning it is merely a deception , Eko grows angry and chases Yemi into the jungle , where he confronts the " Monster " . After being thrown about by the Monster , Eko is finally thrown to the ground . Fatally wounded , he whispers " I saw the Devil " to Locke before dying , although Locke , for whatever reason , decides to tell Sayid he said , " We 're next . " As he dies , we see an image of Eko and Yemi as happy children , walking into the distance . In one of the flashforwards in the final episode of the fourth season , Hurley is seen sitting at a table with a chessboard on it across from a seemingly empty seat . Before he leaves , Hurley says : " Checkmate , Mr. Eko . " 
 = = Personality = = 
 When creating the character , the producers envisioned Mr. Eko as " the one character who comes to terms with living on the island , and not being consumed with trying to get off " . Being introduced as a " <unk> " , a person on the tail section of the plane , Eko is a mysterious and complex character . MSNBC said the character is " always fighting a battle , an internal struggle as to whether the life he led was worthy of pride or shame " . <unk> Adewale Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje explained Mr. Eko 's dedication to pushing the button in the hatch with seeing the hatch as the answer to the mystery of life . Described as a " natural leader " , Mr. Eko is a " strong , silent type , a man of few words " . Jon Bonné of MSNBC said , he is " a dude you don 't mess with " . When Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje was at a bank in Hawaii , a fan said his character was a criminal pretending to be a priest , to which Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje replied : " No , actually , I 'm a priest pretending to be a criminal " . 
 = = Development = = 
 The character of Mr. Eko was created to explore the spiritual element of the show , and to add an African character , which the producers thought would provide " cultural variety " to the cast . Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse 's first choice for the actor to portray Eko was Lance Reddick , after they had seen him as Cedric Daniels on HBO 's The Wire . However , after it was made clear Reddick was unavailable due to the filming schedule of The Wire , Cuse and Lindelof decided to contact Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje , because they were big fans of his work on the HBO prison drama Oz . At the time , Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje was filming Get Rich or Die Tryin ' and , being unfamiliar with Lost , had no intention of joining the cast . While the producers succeeded in persuading Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje to take the role , he did not want to make a long @-@ term commitment to the show and was therefore only hired for a short period of time . Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje accepted the part mostly because it was an opportunity to play a character with a different faith than his Buddhism , and because he enjoyed the idea of being on a deserted island ( he had lived on a deserted island four years prior to being cast on the show ) . Two weeks after he was hired , Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje moved to Oahu , Hawaii , where filming took place . 
 While Mr. Eko was created as a more passive character , the idea changed when the producers first saw Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje play the character . Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje explained : " once they saw me on the screen without a shirt , all 6 foot 2 and using a stick beating three guys up , they knew this guy wasn 't going to be just a passive priest " . Eventually , Cuse and Lindelof decided to combine their original idea for the character with Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje 's character on Oz . Originally , the character was named " Emeka " , and later " <unk> " , but after Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje was cast , the name was changed to " Eko " , in order to be consistent with Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje 's own Nigerian tribal lineage . Eko refers to the City of Legos ( Lagos ) in Nigeria , coming from <unk> , Lord of Lagos . Adding " Mr. " in front of the character 's name was also a suggestion made by Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje . While at first Cuse and Lindelof thought this was " the silliest thing in the world " , they changed their minds after repeating the name a few times , realizing there " was something really cool about it " . The character first appeared in " Adrift " , where he was only shown briefly , knocking down three of the show 's main characters with a stick . Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje was given the stick and told to " knock those three guys out " . Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje felt " there 's no better way to make an entrance " . The religious scripture on the stick was a suggestion of Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje . 
 After he had been on the show for one season , Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje felt uncomfortable living in Hawaii and wanted to return to his residence in London , England . He discussed Mr. Eko 's departure with Lindelof and Cuse , and the three decided the character would die somewhere in the first six episodes of the third season . They also found a " shocking and emotional death " would be the best way to write the character off the show . Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje felt Eko 's death in " The Cost of Living " made the character " complete " , commenting : " The Cost of Living " was " such a well @-@ written episode that I knew I would be able to sew him up in a season " , although Cuse later said he would have preferred the character to remain on the show a little longer . In 2008 , Cuse and Lindelof made hints there were possibilities of the character 's returning . However , despite Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje 's wishes to return for the sixth season , the producers stated he would not be returning . The actor was eventually offered a guest role in the series finale , but turned it down due to salary disagreements . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Overall , the character was positively received . The first week he was on the show , Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje received a lot of fanmail , much to his surprise . Craig Berman of MSNBC called Mr. Eko " one of the most creatively complex characters on the island " . The Los Angeles Times depicted him as " the island 's favorite ' <unk> ' " . IGN named him the third best character from the first three seasons of Lost , behind Hurley and Locke . Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje 's performance was praised by critics ; Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle said he was " probably the best actor in the cast " . In 2006 , Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje shared the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series with the cast of Lost ; they were also named " Entertainers of the Year " by Entertainment Weekly . He was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television in 2005 , but lost the award to Masi Oka of Heroes . 
 Generally , critics and fans were disappointed Mr. Eko was killed after being on the show for only one season . Kristin Dos Santos of E ! called Mr. Eko " the best character of the show " , and was therefore very disappointed with his death . In response to Mr. Eko 's death , Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly stated " I 'll miss Adewale Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje — his acting was up there with Terry O 'Quinn 's , Elizabeth Mitchell 's , and Michael Emerson 's . I guess he was the sacrifice the island demanded " . Writing for Zap2it , Rick Porter said that his death " sucked hard , and loud , and long " . IGN listed Eko 's death as number one on its list of " Top 10 Lost Deaths " .

He then played amateur football for <unk> whilst he looked abroad for a professional contract , spending time in Austria with <unk> Wacker . 
 = = = Portugal = = = 
 He signed for newly promoted Portuguese Primeira Divisão side Campomaiorense in August 1995 after impressing trainer Manuel Fernandes on a trial . The chairman wanted to keep his signing a secret , and so told the press that he had simply signed a player called " Jimmy " , but after his signing was revealed the name stuck and he was known as Jimmy rather than Jerrel for the rest of his career . He failed to score in his first four games and missed a penalty in his fifth game after insisting on taking the penalty ahead of regular taker <unk> <unk> , however he made amends for the miss later in the game by scoring both goals a 2 – 0 win over Gil Vicente . The small club could not survive in the top @-@ flight and were relegated in the 1995 – 96 season . 
 Hasselbaink was signed by Boavista for a € 300 @,@ 000 fee in summer 1996 . The 1996 – 97 season was chaotic for the club , as the chairman sacked two managers , Zoran Filipović and João Resende Alves , before ending the campaign with Rui <unk> . As a result , the " Panthers " only managed a seventh @-@ place finish , but ended the campaign on a high note by winning the Taça de Portugal . Hasselbaink had a good season individually , finishing as the league 's second highest scorer behind Porto 's Mário Jardel . He scored his first professional hat @-@ trick at the club , in a 3 – 1 victory over Marítimo at the Estádio do Bessa ; he later scored a hat @-@ trick in a 7 – 0 win over Gil Vicente , as did teammate Nuno Gomes .

He scored only five league goals before Christmas , but ended the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions following a strong second half of the season . 
 The following season , Hasselbaink 's 18 goals in 36 appearances made him joint @-@ winner ( with Michael Owen and Dwight Yorke ) of the Premier League Golden Boot as Leeds finished fourth in the league under the stewardship of new manager David O 'Leary , thus winning the " Whites " a place in the following year 's UEFA Champions League qualification stages . However he and his agent were dissatisfied with the contract offered by the club , and though he still had two years to run on his existing deal he was sold on . O 'Leary claimed that " What he is looking for I don 't think any club in the country could afford and I don 't think there is anyone on that kind of money over here ( in England ) " . 
 = = = Atlético Madrid = = = 
 Hasselbaink was bought by Spanish club Atlético Madrid for £ 10 million in the middle of 1999 . The " Red @-@ and @-@ Whites " lost the first three La Liga games of the 1999 – 2000 season , but after Hasselbaink scored his first goal for the club to secure a point at Real Zaragoza he continued to score important goals for the club . On 30 October , he scored twice in the Madrid derby as Atlético beat Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium for the first time in nine years . He also scored against Barcelona at Camp Nou , in a 2 – 1 league defeat . Manager Claudio Ranieri aimed to qualify for the Champions League , but resigned in February following poor results .

 In summer 2002 the cause of his hamstring injury was discovered , and he underwent an operation to relieve a blockage in the arteries of his right leg which had been severely restricting circulation . During his recovery he appeared as a pundit for ITV 's coverage of the 2002 FIFA World Cup . Ranieri initiated a squad rotation system for the 2002 – 03 season , but focused the team around Gianfranco Zola , which limited Hasselbaink 's playing time .

On 14 August , he scored on his debut for the club in a 2 – 2 draw with Newcastle United at the Riverside Stadium . In the 2004 – 05 season he finished as the club 's top @-@ scorer with 13 goals in 36 Premier League games , including a hat @-@ trick in a 4 – 0 win over Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park on 16 October . A seventh @-@ place league finish was enough for the club to qualify for the following year 's UEFA Cup . 
 In the 2005 – 06 season he scored ten goals in 22 league games and scored eight goals in 22 cup appearances . He helped Steve McClaren 's " Boro " to defeat Skoda Xanthi ( Greece ) , Grasshopper Club Zürich ( Switzerland ) , Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk ( Ukraine ) , <unk> ( Bulgaria ) , VfB Stuttgart ( Germany ) , A.S. Roma ( Italy ) , FC Basel ( Switzerland ) and Steaua București ( Romania ) en route to the UEFA Cup final .

 Hasselbaink was on the verge of joining Championship side Leicester City in August 2007 , but the club later withdrew their offer . Instead Cardiff City chairman Peter Ridsdale , who worked with Hasselbaink at Leeds United , brought him to Cardiff on a one @-@ year deal , putting him in a veteran strike partnership with Robbie Fowler . Manager Dave Jones said that Hasselbaink initially took time to settle and become match fit but despite being a demanding player his professionalism was ultimately a positive influence . On 19 September , Hasselbaink scored his first goal for Cardiff with a 20 @-@ yard low drive in the 2 – 1 league defeat to Watford at Ninian Park . He was nominated for the Player of the Round in the Fifth Round of the FA Cup after scoring an impressive goal against Wolverhampton Wanderers .

 Hasselbaink came to the attention of Netherlands manager Guus Hiddink whilst playing in England for Leeds United , and made his international debut on 27 May 1998 in a 0 – 0 draw in a friendly with Cameroon at the <unk> in Arnhem ; he came on as a 61st @-@ minute substitute for Marc Overmars . On 1 June he scored his first goal in a 5 – 1 friendly victory over Paraguay , and a few days later scored his second goal in another 5 – 1 friendly victory over Nigeria . He was part of the Dutch squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France , as back @-@ up to established international strikers Patrick Kluivert , Dennis Bergkamp and Pierre van Hooijdonk and wingers Boudewijn Zenden and Marc Overmars . With other strikers not fully fit , Hasselbaink started the opening game against Belgium at the Stade de France , but missed a scoring opportunity in the 0 – 0 draw and was taken off for Bergkamp after 65 minutes . Kluivert was sent off in the match but Bergkamp was played as the only striker in the next game against South Korea , and van Hooijdonk was taken off the bench to replace him . In the third group game against Mexico at the Stade Geoffroy @-@ Guichard Hasselbaink came on for Bergkamp after 78 minutes , which was to be his last appearance at the tournament as Kluivert returned from suspension to leave Hasselbaink as Hiddink 's fourth choice forward ; Netherlands ended the tournament in fourth place . 
 Hiddink resigned and was replaced by his assistant Frank Rijkaard , who rarely picked Hasselbaink at international level . He next played on 18 August 1999 , alongside Kluivert and Ruud van Nistelrooy in a friendly against Denmark ; he was taken off for Clarence Seedorf and the game ended 0 – 0 . He next appeared six months later , playing ten minutes against Germany and 70 minutes against Scotland , and despite van Nistelrooy being injured Hasselbaink was not selected for UEFA Euro 2000 as the five forwards chosen were Bergkamp , Kluivert , van Hooijdonk , Roy Makaay and Peter van Vossen . He had been part of the 25 man initial squad but , along with André <unk> and Winston Bogarde , was not chosen for the final 22 .

 = Kauri gum = 
 Kauri gum is a fossilized resin detracted from kauri trees ( Agathis australis ) , which is made into crafts such as jewellery . Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand , before Māori and European settlers caused deforestation , causing several areas to revert to sand dunes , scrubs , and swamps . Even afterward , ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests . 
 Kauri gum formed when resin from a kauri trees leaked out through fractures or cracks in the bark , hardening with the exposure to air . Lumps commonly fell to the ground and became covered with soil and forest litter , eventually <unk> . Other lumps formed as branches forked or trees were damaged , which released the resin . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The Māori had many uses for the gum , which they called <unk> . Fresh gum was used as a type of chewing gum ( older gum was softened by soaking and mixing with juice of the <unk> thistle ) . Highly flammable , the gum was also used as a fire @-@ starter , or bound in flax to act as a torch . Burnt and mixed with animal fat , it made a dark pigment for moko tattooing . Kauri gum was also crafted into jewellery , keepsakes , and small decorative items . Like amber , kauri gum sometimes includes insects and plant material . 
 Kauri gum was used commercially in varnish , and can be considered a type of copal ( the name given to resin used in such a way ) . Kauri gum was found to be particularly good for this , and from the mid @-@ 1840s was exported to London and America . Tentative exports had begun a few years earlier , however , for use in marine glue and as fire @-@ <unk> ; gum had even made up part of an export cargo to Australia in 1814 . 
 Since the kauri gum was found to mix more easily with linseed oil , at lower temperatures , than other resins , by the 1890s , 70 percent of all oil varnishes made in England used kauri gum . It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century , and from 1910 was used extensively in the manufacture of linoleum . From the 1930s , the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found , but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high @-@ grade varnish for violins . 
 Kauri gum was Auckland 's main export in the second half of the 19th century , sustaining much of the early growth of the city . Between 1850 and 1950 , 450 @,@ 000 tons of gum were exported . The peak in the gum market was 1899 , with 11 @,@ 116 tons exported that year , with a value of £ 600 @,@ 000 ( $ 989 @,@ 700 ) . The average annual export was over 5 @,@ 000 tons , with the average price gained £ 63 ( $ 103 @.@ 91 ) per ton . 
 = = Appearance = = 
 The gum varied in color depending on the condition of the original tree . It also depended on where the gum had formed and how long it had been buried . Colors ranged from chalky @-@ white , through red @-@ brown to black ; the most prized was a pale gold , as it was hard and translucent . The size of each lump also varied greatly . Swamps tended to yield the small nuggets known as " chips " , whereas the hillsides tended to produce larger lumps . The majority were the size of acorns , although some were found which weighed a few pounds ; the largest ( and rarest ) were reported to weigh half a hundredweight . Kauri gum shares a few characteristics with amber , another fossilised resin found in the Northern Hemisphere , but where amber can be dated as millions of year old , carbon @-@ dating suggests the age of most kauri gum is a few thousand years . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Most of the gumfields were in Northland , Coromandel and Auckland , the site of the original kauri forests . Initially , the gum was readily accessible , commonly found lying on the ground . Captain Cook reported the presence of resinous lumps on the beach at Mercury Bay , Coromandel , in 1769 , although he suspected it came from the mangroves , and missionary Samuel Marsden spoke of their presence in Northland in 1819 . 
 By 1850 , most of the surface @-@ lying gum had been picked up , and people began digging for it . The hillsides yielded shallow @-@ buried gum ( about 1 m ) , but in the swamps and beaches , it was buried much further down ( 4 m or below ) . 
 = = Gum @-@ diggers = = 
 Gum @-@ diggers were men and women who dug for kauri gum , a fossilised resin , in the old kauri fields of New Zealand at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries . The gum was used mainly for varnish . The term may be a source for the nickname " Digger " given to New Zealand soldiers in World War I. In 1898 , a gum @-@ digger described " the life of a gum @-@ digger " as " wretched , and one of the last [ occupations ] a man would take to . " 
 Gum @-@ diggers worked in the old kauri fields , most of which were then covered by swamp or scrub , digging for the gum . Much of the population was transient , moving from field to field , and they lived in rough huts or tents ( which were called " <unk> " , after the Maori for ' house ' ) . It was extremely hard work and not very well paid , but it attracted many Maori and European settlers , including women and children . There were many Dalmatians , who had first come to work the South Island goldfields in the 1860s . They were transient workers , rather than settlers , and much of their income was sent out of the country , resulting in much resentment from the local workforce . In 1898 , the " Kauri Gum Industry Act " was passed , which reserved gum @-@ grounds for British subjects , and requiring all other diggers to be licensed . By 1910 , only British subjects could hold gum @-@ digging licences . 
 Gum @-@ digging was the major source of income for settlers in Northland , and farmers often worked the gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land . By the 1890s , 20 @,@ 000 people were engaged in gum @-@ digging , of which 7000 worked full @-@ time . Gum @-@ digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas ; Auckland families would cross the Waitemata Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead , causing damage to public roads and private farms , and leading to local council management of the problem . 
 = = = <unk> methods = = = 
 Most gum was dug from the ground using gum @-@ spears ( pointed rods to probe for gum ) and " <unk> " , defined as blade @-@ edged spades for cutting through old wood and roots as well as soil . Once the gum was retrieved it would need to be scraped and cleaned . 
 Digging in swamps was more complicated ; a longer spear ( up to 8m ) was often used , often fitted with a hooked end to scoop out the lumps . Scrub was often cleared first with fire ; some got out of control and swamp fires could burn for weeks . Holes were often dug by teams in both hills and swamps — often up to 12m deep — and some wetlands were drained to aid in the excavation of gum . As field gum became scarce , " bush gum " was obtained by purposely cutting the bark of kauri trees and returning months later to retrieve the hardened resin . Due to the damage caused to the trees by the cutting the practice was banned in state forests in 1905 . Gum chips , small lumps useful for the manufacture of linoleum , were difficult to find , and by 1910 , the process of washing and sieving to retrieve the chips became common . The process was later mechanised . 
 = = Gum merchants = = 
 <unk> generally sold their gum to local <unk> , who transported it to Auckland ( generally by sea ) for sale to merchants and exporters . There were six major export firms in Auckland who dealt in gum , employing several hundred workers who graded and <unk> the gum for export , packing them in cases made from kauri timber . 
 As early as the 1830s and 1840s , merchants , including Gilbert Mair and Logan Campbell , were buying gum from local Māori for £ 5 ( $ 8 @.@ 25 ) a ton , or trading it for goods . The majority of the gum was exported to America and London ( from whence it was distributed throughout Europe ) , although smaller amounts were sent to Australia , Hong Kong , Japan and Russia . 
 = Golubac Fortress = 
 The Golubac Fortress ( Serbian : <unk> <unk> or <unk> grad , Hungarian : <unk> <unk> , Bulgarian : <unk> , Romanian : Cetatea <unk> , Turkish : <unk> <unk> ) was a medieval fortified town on the south side of the Danube River , 4 km downstream from the modern @-@ day town of Golubac , Serbia . The fortress , which was most likely built during the 14th century , is split into three compounds which were built in stages . It has ten towers , most of which started square , and several of which received many @-@ sided reinforcements with the advent of firearms . 
 Golubac Fortress has had a tumultuous history . Prior to its construction it was the site of a Roman settlement . During the Middle Ages , it became the object of many battles , especially between the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary . It changed hands repeatedly , passing between Turks , Bulgarians , Hungarians , Serbs , and Austrians , until 1867 , when it was turned over to the Serbian Knez , Mihailo Obrenović III . Now , it is a popular tourist attraction in the region and a sightseeing point on Danube boat tours . 
 = = Location = = 
 Golubac , in the Braničevo District of north @-@ eastern Serbia and on the modern @-@ day border with Romania , marks the entrance to the <unk> national park . It is strategically located on the embankment of the Danube River where it narrows to form the Iron Gate gorge , allowing for the regulation and taxation of traffic across and along the river . In the Middle Ages , this was done with the aid of a strong chain connected to <unk> , a rock on the far side of the river . 
 = = History = = 
 Golubac 's early history is uncertain . Inscriptions and evidence of older defensive structures in the area show the presence of a Roman settlement , sometimes named " <unk> , " long before the creation of Golubac . From 803 to 1018 , the area belonged to the First Bulgarian Empire , to Byzantium from then until 1193 , and the Second Bulgarian Empire until 1257 . The area remained in Bulgarian hands from then until the Ottoman conquest in the 15th century , with control of the region changing many times between Hungarians , Bulgarians and Serbs before then . It is also unclear whether the medieval fortress was built by Bulgarians , Serbs or Hungarians , or how many towers it had originally . However , an Orthodox chapel built as part of one tower shows that it , at least , was built by a local noble . There is also uncertainty about when construction started , although it is generally agreed that the majority of the fortress was built early in the 14th century . 
 The first known record of Golubac is in Hungarian sources from 1335 , when it was occupied by Hungarian military . Sometime between 1345 and 1355 , Serbian Tsar Stefan Dušan toured the Braničevo region , which was part of Serbia . He also visited Golubac , which was under the command of Castellan Toma , Voivode of Transylvania . After Dušan 's death , the House of Rastislalić gained influence in Braničevo , later winning independence . According to Serbian chroniclers , Knez Lazar evicted the last Rastislalić feudal lord , <unk> Branković , in 1379 , then presented outlying villages to monasteries in Wallachia . By the time of the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 , Golubac was held by Serbia . It is unclear when or how it changed hands , though one source puts it later than 1382 . After the battle , the fortress was lost to Sultan Bayezid I , marking the first possession by the Ottoman Empire . In 1391 , Golubac switched hands twice . Hungarian <unk> Comes Péter <unk> won it , but shortly afterwards lost it again to the Turks . Later , it returned once again to the Kingdom of Hungary . 
 The first extended Serbian possession of Golubac began in 1403 when Sigismund , King of Hungary , ceded it as a personal fiefdom to Despot Stefan Lazarević after he became a Hungarian vassal . When the issue of Stefan 's successor came up in 1426 , he and Sigismund met in May in Tata to discuss it . A contract was written stating that Sigismund would accept Đurađ Branković as successor on the condition that Golubac , Belgrade , and Mačva were returned to Hungary when Stefan died . After Stefan 's death in 1427 , Sigismund hurried to have the clauses of the Tata contract fulfilled , and Belgrade and Mačva were handed over without a problem . However , Golubac 's commander , Voivode Jeremija , demanded a compensation of 12 @,@ 000 ducats . When Sigismund refused to pay , Jeremija handed Golubac to the Turks , who turned it into the pasha 's residence . 
 Despite gaining Golubac , Sultan Murad II was not pleased with the increased Hungarian influence elsewhere in Serbia , so he sent his army to attack . One squad came from Golubac and targeted nearby Serbian and Hungarian settlements in the Braničevo region . In response , Đurađ personally travelled to Golubac , promising forgiveness to Jeremija and urging him to return the fortress by any means possible . The Voivode refused , and attacked the Despot when he and his escort attempted to enter the walls . These betrayals were followed in 1428 by the Battle of Golubac . 
 Around April 1428 , Sigismund amassed an army of 25 @,@ 000 infantry , 6 @,@ 000 Wallachian archers led by Prince Dan II , 200 Italian artillery , and a number of Polish cavalry on the far side of the Danube , then attacked Golubac and the Turks . He also had ships attacking from the river , one of which was commanded by <unk> Rozgonyi wife of <unk> Comes István Rozgonyi . Murad rushed to help the besieged Turks , arriving in late May . Sigismund , who did not wish to fight the bigger army , finalised a treaty by early June . Once part of the Hungarian army had withdrawn to the far side of the river , however , the Turkish commander Sinan Bey attacked their rear , capturing and killing those who remained , among them the Polish knight Zawisza Czarny . Sigismund was nearly caught with the rest of his army ; the intervention of <unk> Rozgonyi is solely responsible for his rescue . 
 During this and other fights resulting from Stefan 's death , southern and eastern Serbia , including the Monastery of <unk> near Golubac , suffered heavily . It was after this fighting , however , that Sigismund was first referred to as " our Emperor " , in the memoir of a <unk> monk , in contrast to the Turkish " pagan emperor " . 
 The Ottoman Empire retained control of Golubac throughout its occupation of the Serbian Despotate . After years of fighting , which resulted in the Hungarian army expelling the Ottomans from Serbia , the Peace of Szeged restored the Despotate late in the summer of 1444 . Included in the redefined territory , after much discussion , was Golubac Fortress . However , the Turks once again conquered it after the death of Đurađ Branković in 1456 . In 1458 , Matthias Corvinus of Hungary regained the fortress , but lost it to Mehmed II that same year . 
 The years 1481 – 82 led to more fighting between the Hungarians and Turks . During the fall of 1481 , while Golubac was held by the Ottoman Empire , <unk> Comes Pál Kinizsi undertook an expedition against the Turks in the Temes area . On November 2 , 1481 , he turned his army of 32 @,@ 000 men south towards the Danube , pushing to Kruševac . At Golubac , a thousand Turkish cavalry were killed or taken prisoner , 24 ships were sunk , and <unk> <unk> Bey , pasha of Ottoman @-@ held Smederevo and leader of the Turkish army , was beheaded at the gate by Jakšić , one of Kinizsi 's men . The Turks were forced to retreat and leave the fortress behind . Kinizsi 's foray was only a raid , however , and shortly after he returned to Temes . The Turks , who had suffered heavily but did not lose any land , retook Golubac and quickly improved its fortifications . 
 Golubac was held by the Habsburg Monarchy between 1688 and 1690 and 1718 and 1739 . Serb rebels controlled it during <unk> Krajina in 1788 – 91 , and again from 1804 – 13 , during the First Serbian Uprising . Afterwards , it fell back under Ottoman control until 1867 when it , along with Kalemegdan and other towns in Serbia , was given to Knez Mihailo of Serbia . 
 = = = In recent years = = = 
 From the late 19th century into the early mid @-@ 20th century , bloodsucking flies sometimes referred to as " Golubac mosquitoes " thrived in the area . They were particularly dangerous to livestock , some years killing off entire herds of cattle . After World War I , a road was constructed that went through both of the fort 's portcullises . This road is the shortest link between Serbia and eastern parts of the Balkan peninsula . Between 1964 – 72 , a hydroelectric dam was built in the Iron Gate gorge , significantly elevating the river 's water level . As a result , the lower edge of the slope and corresponding parts of the fortress are now flooded . 
 From the beginning of the 21st century , much of the fort has been overgrown , making most of the sections higher on the hill inaccessible . During the spring of 2005 , a public project to restore the fort was started . Most of the plants were removed and certain parts , like the fountain in the moat raised in honour of knight Zawisza Czarny , were repaired . The walls , towers and stone stairs are in good condition , but the wooden floors and steps have rotted out , making most of the upper floors impassable . Golubac has also gained popularity as a tourist attraction . Two key reasons are the major road that passes through it , and its proximity to <unk> Vir , making the two locales a touristic whole . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Golubac consists of three main compounds guarded by 10 towers and 2 portcullises , all connected by fortress walls 2 – 3 metres thick . In front of the fortress , the forward wall ( I ) doubled as the outer wall of the moat , which connected to the Danube and was likely filled with water . A settlement for common people was situated in front of the wall . 
 As is the case with many fortresses , Golubac 's structure was modified over time . For years , there were only five towers . Later , four more were added . The towers were all built as squares , a sign of the fortress ' age , showing that battles were still fought with cold steel . Once firearms came into use , the Turks fortified the western towers with cannon ports and polygonal or cylindrical reinforcements up to two metres thick . After the Hungarian raid in 1481 , they added the final tower , complete with cannon embrasures and galleries . 
 = = = Upper compound = = = 
 The upper compound ( A ) is the oldest part of the fortress . It includes the citadel ( tower 1 ) and the Serbian Orthodox chapel ( tower 4 ) . Although it remains uncertain , the chapel has led many to believe that this section was built by a Serbian noble . 
 Later , during either Serbian or Hungarian rule , the fortress was expanded to include the rear and forward compounds . 
 = = = Rear compound = = = 
 The rear compound ( D ) is separated from the upper compound by both a wall connecting towers 2 and 4 , and a steep rock 3 – 4 metres high . Next to tower 5 is a building ( VII ) which was probably used as a military barracks and for ammunition storage . 
 = = = Forward compound = = = 
 The forward compound was split into lower ( C ) and upper ( B ) parts by a wall linking towers 4 and 7 . The entrance ( II ) is in the lower part , guarded by towers 8 and 9 . Tower 8 has , in turn , been fortified with a cannon port . Opposing the entrance was a second portcullis that led to the rear compound . Along the path was a ditch 0 @.@ 5 metres wide and 0 @.@ 75 metres deep which then became a steep decline . At the outer end of the lower part , and connected to the 9th tower with a low wall , is tower 10 , which the Turks added to act as a lower artillery tower . It controlled passage along the Danube and guarded the entrance to the harbour , which was probably situated between towers 5 and 10 . There are remains connected to tower 8 which probably formed a larger whole with it , but the lower part did not otherwise contain buildings . 
 In the wall that separated the upper and lower parts was a gate that led to the upper part . The upper part did not have buildings , but there remains a pathway to the stairs up to gate IV , which is 2 metres off the ground , right next to tower 3 . 
 = = = Towers = = = 
 The first nine towers are 20 – 25 metres high . In all ten towers , the floors and stairs inside were made of wood , while external stairs were made of stone . Half of the towers ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 10 ) have all four sides and are completely made of stone , while the other half ( 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ) lack the side facing the interior of the fort . 
 Tower 1 , nicknamed " Hat Tower " ( <unk> @-@ kula ) , is one of the oldest towers , and doubles as citadel and dungeon tower . It has an eight @-@ sided base with a circular spire rising from it and a square interior . The next tower to the west , tower 2 , is completely circular in shape . The third tower has a square base , with the open side facing the dungeon tower to the north . On the top floor is a terrace that overlooks the Danube and the entrance to the Iron Gate gorge . Down the slope from tower 3 is tower 4 , which also has a square base . The ground floor has a Serbian Orthodox chapel that was built into the tower , rather than being added later . The last tower along this wall , tower 5 , is the only tower to remain completely square . 
 The top tower along the front wall of the forward compound , tower 6 , has a square base which was reinforced with a six @-@ sided foundation . Working west , the square base of tower 7 was reinforced with a circular foundation . Tower 8 , on the upper side of the front portcullis , has an irregular , but generally square , base . It is also the shortest of the first nine towers . Guarding the other side is tower 9 , which has a square base reinforced by an eight @-@ sided foundation . 
 The last tower is the cannon tower . It has only one floor and is the shortest of all ten towers . It was built with an eight @-@ sided base and cannon ports to help control traffic on the Danube . Tower 10 is almost identical to the three artillery towers added to Smederevo fortress .

 = = Significance = = 
 Considering the age and location of the Golubac Fortress , it is both large and well @-@ preserved . Its placement at the head of the Iron Gate gorge allowed for easy control of river traffic . It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river , which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire , especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman @-@ held . The importance of the fortress is further indicated by the attention it received from Sigismund and Murad II , rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities . The Golubac Fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979 , and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia .

 Space Run is a tower defense video game developed by <unk> Games and published by Focus Home Interactive . It was released for Microsoft Windows on June 13 , 2014 , and later released for OS X and Linux . The player assumes the role of a cargo ship pilot , and must build modules and weapons to defend their cargo from attacking ships and other hazards . The game received mixed reviews from critics , and a sequel was announced in March 2016 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player acts as pilot for a cargo ship , performing space runs for various corporations . The ship is a flat platform made up of hexagonal tiles . The player places weapons and modules on the tiles in order to defend the ship from enemies and hazards . Different structures have varying placement requirements , or may require more than one tile to be placed . For example , most weapons must be placed facing outward into empty space , while some require power to be supplied by an adjacent power source . 
 Modules and weapons are built using a resource represented by a lug nut . This resource slowly accrues on its own , but destroyed targets drop varying amounts that can be collected by moving the cursor over them . Each corporation provides a different type of cargo , which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics . One corporation provides simple cargo crates , as well as a mechanic module that can produce more cargo crates during the mission in order to increase the mission reward . Another corporation provides passenger modules , which must face outward , limiting space for weapons . 
 Each mission has a timed duration that the player must beat , with two tiers of time bonus . The player is rewarded with space credits dependent on the amount of cargo that survived the mission and how quickly they completed it . Reputation , displayed as stars , is rewarded based whether or not the player met cargo or time thresholds . Space credits are used between missions in order to <unk> special abilities and bonuses for modules , while gaining reputation unlocks new modules .

 Space Run received mixed reviews upon release . It received an aggregate score of 73 from Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from critics , while GameRankings assigned a score of 75 % . 
 GameSpot gave the game an 8 out of 10 , praising the game 's characters , art , voice acting and challenging gameplay . However , they noted that at times that spoken dialogue sometimes did not match the displayed text dialogue . A reviewer of PC Gamer scored the game 69 out of 100 , noting that Space Run attempts to reverse the typical tower defense concept , but ultimately relies on memorizing missions rather than clever design .

 Cigars of the Pharaoh ( French : Les <unk> du <unk> ) is the fourth volume of The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé . Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle for its children 's supplement Le Petit Vingtième , it was serialised weekly from December 1932 to February 1934 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1934 . The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy , who are travelling in Egypt when they discover a pharaoh 's tomb filled with dead Egyptologists and boxes of cigars . Pursuing the mystery of these cigars , they travel across Arabia and India , and reveal the secrets of an international drug smuggling enterprise . 
 Following the publication of Tintin in America , Hergé had been keen to produce a mystery story , and had been inspired by the tabloid speculation surrounding an alleged Curse of the Pharaohs following the 1922 discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun . Cigars of the Pharaoh proved a commercial success in Belgium , and Hergé followed it with The Blue Lotus , a story which continues many of the plot elements that began in Cigars . The series itself became a defining part of the Franco @-@ Belgian comics tradition . In 1955 , Cigars of the Pharaoh was re @-@ drawn and coloured in Hergé 's distinctive ligne @-@ claire style by the cartoonist and his Studios Hergé team ; during this process a number of minor plot elements were changed . The comic was adapted for a 1991 episode of the Ellipse / Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin . Critical reception of the story has been positive , with analysis being focused on its innovative narrative and stylistic choices , as well as its introduction of three recurring characters , the detectives Thomson and Thompson and villain Rastapopoulos .

 Georges Remi — best known under the pen name Hergé — was employed as editor and illustrator of Le Petit Vingtième ( " The Little Twentieth " ) , a children 's supplement to Le Vingtième Siècle ( " The Twentieth Century " ) , a staunchly Roman Catholic , conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé 's native Brussels which was run by the Abbé Norbert Wallez . In 1929 , Hergé began The Adventures of Tintin comic for Le Petit Vingtième , revolving around the exploits of fictional Belgian reporter Tintin . Wallez ordered Hergé to set his first adventure in the Soviet Union to act as anti @-@ socialist propaganda for children ( Tintin in the Land of the Soviets ) , to set his second adventure in the Belgian Congo to encourage colonial sentiment ( Tintin in the Congo ) , and to set his third adventure in the United States to use the story as a denunciation of American capitalism ( Tintin in America ) . 
 For his fourth Adventure , Hergé was eager to write a mystery story . The 1930s saw mystery novels flourish across Western Europe with the success of authors like Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen . The decision to create a scenario around the tomb of Kih @-@ Oskh was influenced by the 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun 's tomb by Howard Carter and the surrounding tabloid claims regarding a Curse of the Pharaohs . Hergé returned to this theme for The Seven Crystal Balls ( 1948 ) . The name Kih @-@ Oskh was an allusion to the kiosks where Le Petit Vingtième was sold . The Kih @-@ Oskh symbol was described by Hergé as a distortion of the Taoist symbol of the <unk> , with biographer Benoît Peeters thinking that it foreshadowed the " Yellow Mark " that featured in the Blake and Mortimer comic The Yellow " M " ( 1952 – 54 ) authored by Hergé 's later collaborator Edgar P. Jacobs . Hergé was aided in the production of Cigars of the Pharaoh by his assistant Paul " Jam " Jamin , who was heavily influenced by British magazines The Humorist and Punch . 
 Hergé took influence from the published works of French adventurer and gunrunner Henry de Monfreid , particularly his books Secrets of the Red Sea and The Hashish Cruise . Having lived through the First World War , Hergé disliked arms dealers , and used Monfreid as the basis for the gunrunner character in Cigars . The idea of mummified bodies being lined up along a wall was adopted from Pierre Benoît 's 1919 book L <unk> ( Atlantis ) , which had recently been made into a 1932 film by Georg Wilhelm Pabst . The wall paintings depicted on a cover of Le Petit Vingtième was based on a bas @-@ relief of Hathor and Seti I housed in the Louvre , Paris , while the throne featured in Tintin 's dream was adopted from that found in the tomb of Tutankhamun . The inclusion of the secret society operating the smuggling ring was influenced by right @-@ wing conspiracy theories about Freemasonry , with Hergé likely gaining information on the brotherhood from a 1932 article by Lucien <unk> @-@ Reynaud in the radical magazine La Crapouillot ( The Mortar Shell ) . 
 = = = Original publication , 1931 – 32 = = = 
 On 24 November 1932 , Le Petit Vingtième published a fictional interview between Jamin and Tintin in which the reporter announced that he would be travelling to China via Egypt , India , Ceylon , and Indochina . On 8 December 1932 , the story began serialisation in the supplement under the title of The Adventures of Tintin , Reporter , in the Orient . As the story began in Egypt rather than China , Hergé briefly renamed the story to The Cairo Affair . The story was not following any plan or pre @-@ written plot , with Hergé as usual devising the story on a week @-@ by @-@ week basis . When the time came to assemble and publish the story in book form , Hergé decided to divide it into two volumes and to give them each a new title ; the first half , which is set in Egypt , Arabia , and India , he titled Cigars of the Pharaoh , while the second half , set in China , became The Blue Lotus . Cigars was the first of the Adventures published by Casterman , with whom Hergé had signed a contract in late 1933 , although much to his annoyance , they delayed publication until the autumn of 1934 , after the culmination of the summer holidays . In 1936 , they successfully requested that he produce several colour plates to be inserted into the reprint of the book . 
 Cigars of the Pharaoh saw the introduction of several characters who would gain a recurring role in The Adventures of Tintin . The most notable are the two detectives , who were initially called " Agent <unk> and Agent <unk> bis . " In his 1941 Tintin play co @-@ written with Jacques Van Melkebeke , Tintin in India : The Mystery of the Blue Diamond , Hergé named them " Durant and Durand , " although he later renamed them " Dupont and Dupond . " The series ' English @-@ language translators , Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale @-@ Cooper , renamed them " Thomson and Thompson . " They were based on a combination of the stereotypical Belgian policeman of the 1930s with Hergé 's observations of his father and uncle , Alexis and Léon Remi . 
 The series introduced Tintin 's adversary Roberto Rastapopoulos in Cigars of the Pharaoh , here depicted as a famous Hollywood film director . It is only in the successor volume , The Blue Lotus , that he is also revealed as the head of an international criminal organisation . His name was developed by one of Hergé 's friends ; Hergé thought it was hilarious and decided to use it . He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname , but the character fitted anti @-@ Semitic stereotypes of Jews ; Hergé was adamant that the character was not Jewish . A fourth recurring character introduced in this story was the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira , who would reappear in both the subsequent Adventures set in the Middle East , Land of Black Gold and The Red Sea Sharks . One of the core characters of the story was Sophocles Sarcophagus , an Egyptologist who is the stereotype of an eccentric professor . In this respect , he is a prototype for the character of Cuthbert Calculus , whom Hergé would introduce later in Red Rackham 's Treasure . 
 It was during the serialisation of Cigars that Wallez was embroiled in a scandal after he was accused of defaming the Bureau of Public Works . The accusation resulted in a legal case being brought against the newspaper , and in response its owners demanded Wallez 's resignation , which was tended in August 1933 . Without Wallez , Hergé became despondent , and in March 1934 he tried to resign , but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 and 3000 francs and his workload was reduced , with Jamin taking responsibility for the day @-@ to @-@ day running of Le Petit Vingtième . 
 = = = Second version , 1955 = = = 
 In the 1940s and 1950s , when Hergé 's popularity had increased , he and his team at Studios Hergé redrew many of the original black @-@ and @-@ white Tintin adventures in colour using the ligne claire ( " clear line " ) drawing style he had developed so that they visually fitted in with the new Tintin stories being created . The Studios reformatted and coloured Cigars of the Pharaoh in 1955 ; it was the last of the early works to undergo this process . 
 In cutting down the length of the story , Hergé removed various isolated scenes that added nothing to the development of the plot , such as those in which Tintin confronts a bat , a crocodile , and snakes . The Arabian city that Tintin and Snowy searched for in the story was no longer identified as Mecca , while the Maharajah 's three advisers were removed . New elements were also inserted ; Hergé added a depiction of ancient Egyptian pyramids into the background . Hergé also retroactively added the character of Allan into the story ; he had originally been introduced in the later , 1941 adventure The Crab with the Golden Claws , where he was Rastapopoulos ' henchman . Hergé inserted an allusion to his friend and collaborator Edgar P. Jacobs into the story by including a mummified professor named E.P. <unk> in the Egyptian tomb . 
 Whereas the original version had included Sheikh <unk> Pasha showing Tintin a copy of Tintin in America , in the 1955 version this was changed to the earlier Tintin in the Congo , and Hergé would change it again for subsequent printings , this time to Destination Moon ( 1953 ) , an Adventure set chronologically after Cigars . Benoît Peeters exclaimed that with this scene , the reader can imagine Tintin 's surprise at encountering an adventure he had not yet had and which included the characters of Captain Haddock and Cuthbert Calculus whom he had not yet met . Another anachronism in this version appears when Snowy refers to Marlinspike Hall , the ancestral home of Captain Haddock , from the much later volumes of the series . Harry Thompson opined that the most important changes to the book were artistic , for in the late 1950s Hergé was at the peak of his artistic ability . 
 = = = Later publications = = = 
 Casterman republished the original black @-@ and @-@ white version in 1979 in a French @-@ language collected volume with The Blue Lotus and The Broken Ear , the second part of the Archives Hergé collection . In 1983 , they then published a facsimile version of the original . 
 = = Critical analysis = = 
 Jean @-@ Marc and Randy Lofficier considered Cigars of the Pharaoh to be graphically between Tintin in America and The Blue Lotus , as Hergé was expanding his " visual vocabulary " and making use of " unforgettable moments " such as the dream sequence in the tomb . Although recognising that Hergé was still devising his plot on a week @-@ by @-@ week basis , they thought that the work was an improvement on his earlier stories because of the inclusion of " mystery and fantasy " . Awarding it three stars out of five , they thought the book was a " surreal thriller , drenched and atmospheric . " Believing that the work not only dealt with madness , but also was madness , they thought the book evoked " a sense of dreamlike suspension of belief . " They also highlighted the inclusion of the Kih @-@ Oskh symbol throughout the book , describing it as being akin to a recurring musical theme , stating that it added " a note of pure <unk> . " 
 Harry Thompson considered Cigars of the Pharaoh " almost completely unrecognisable from its predecessors " , praising its " inspired comic characters " and " observed character comedy " , which he thought escaped the sheer slapstick evident in the earlier Adventures . He also praised the elements of mystery and suspense that Hergé introduced , opining that it created " a genuine sense of fear without recourse to a deus ex machina . " More critically , he thought that the plot 's " glaring flaw " was the immediate transposition of events from Egypt to India , also believing that the inclusion of British colonialists as the antagonists made " partial amends " for the colonialist attitude displayed by Tintin in Tintin in the Congo . Michael Farr thought that Tintin was " a maturer hero " in Cigars , being more of a detective than a reporter . He thought that the dream sequence was " one of the most imaginative and disturbing scenes " in the series , illustrating Hergé 's " growing virtuosity with the medium . " He also praised the scenes set in the Indian colonial bungalow , commenting that it was " claustrophobic and sinisterly dramatic " and worthy of the work of Agatha Christie , opining that the car chase provided " a highly cinematic ending . " Overall , he thought it to be a narrative " rich in mystery and drama " which was as much of a landmark in the series as The Blue Lotus . 
 Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters thought that that with Cigars , Hergé was engaging in the " <unk> " , and that the opening scene had echoes of Rodolphe Töpffer 's Mr Pencil . He also thought it the first of the Adventures to have a " semblance " or " narrative unity . " Fellow biographer Pierre Assouline thought that the story was difficult for the reader to follow , because the exoticism of the backdrop faded amid the fast pace of the narrative . Literary critic Tom McCarthy highlighted the prominent role of tobacco in the story , drawing on the ideas of French philosopher Jacques Derrida to suggest the potential symbolism of this . He also suggested that the inclusion of mummified Egyptologists in the story warns readers of the " dangers of mummification through interpretation . "

 Cigars of the Pharaoh was adapted into a 1991 episode of The Adventures of Tintin television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana . Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi , Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin . In 2010 , the television channel Arte filmed an episode of its documentary series , Sur les traces de Tintin ( On the traces of Tintin ) , in Egypt exploring the inspiration and setting of the Cigars of the Pharaoh . 
 = 21st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry = 
 The 21st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War . It was organized in Worcester , Massachusetts and mustered into service on August 23 , 1861 . 
 After garrison duty at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , the regiment served with the Coast Division commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside . The Coast Division was deployed in January 1862 for operations on the coast of North Carolina , and participated in the Battle of Roanoke Island and the Battle of New Bern among other engagements . Burnside 's division was recalled to Virginia in July 1862 . The 21st Massachusetts was then attached to the Army of the Potomac and participated in several of the largest battles of the Civil War , including the Second Battle of Bull Run , the Battle of Antietam , and the Battle of Fredericksburg . The most devastating engagement of the war for the 21st was the Battle of Chantilly , fought on September 1 , 1862 , during which the unit suffered 35 percent casualties . From March 1863 to January 1864 , the 21st served with Burnside in the Department of the Ohio , seeing action in Kentucky and eastern Tennessee . In May 1864 , the regiment rejoined the Army of the Potomac , participating in Lt. Gen. Ulysses Grant 's Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg . The regiment was a favorite of Clara Barton , the famed battlefield nurse , who was also from Worcester County , Massachusetts . 
 By the end of its three years of service , the 21st Massachusetts had been reduced from 1 @,@ 000 men to fewer than 100 . Of these losses , 152 were killed in action or died from wounds received in action , approximately 400 were discharged due to wounds , 69 were taken prisoner , and approximately 300 were discharged due to disease , resignation , or desertion . Those of the 21st who chose to re @-@ enlist at the end of their initial three @-@ year commitment were eventually consolidated with the 36th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry on October 21 , 1864 . 
 = = Organization and early duty = = 
 Following the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21 , 1861 ( the first major engagement of the war and a disastrous defeat for the untested Union army ) , citizens of the northern states began to realize that the Civil War would not end quickly . Additional troops would be needed beyond the 75 @,@ 000 volunteers that had been called out for 90 days of service . As a result , over the summer of 1861 , volunteers rushed to enlist for a term of three years . The 21st Massachusetts was among the " three year regiments " organized after the First Battle of Bull Run . 
 The regiment was formed during July and August 1861 . The designated camp of assembly was the Agricultural Fair Grounds in Worcester . The majority of the companies were from Worcester County with nearly every town in that county represented on the regiment 's rolls . Hampden , Hampshire , and Franklin Counties were also represented . 
 The first commanding officer of the 21st was Col. Augustus Morse , who was involved in the comb making industry in Leominster , Massachusetts and had been a major general in the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia prior to the war . According to Charles Walcott , the regimental historian , despite Morse 's decades of experience with the State Militia , he was , " entirely destitute of soldierly enthusiasm or spirit , wonderfully ignorant of military drill and <unk> , and a wretched disciplinarian . " 
 The regiment , originally numbering slightly more than 1 @,@ 000 men , departed Worcester on August 23 , 1861 . They were armed with inferior smoothbore muskets that had been converted from flintlock to percussion lock . After a brief , but tense , three @-@ day encampment in Baltimore , the regiment moved to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , arriving on August 30 . The regiment garrisoned the Naval Academy for four months . It was a comfortable post . Maj. William S. Clark of the 21st wrote that the regiment was " delightfully situated , enjoying the very romance of war . " 
 During their stay in Annapolis , the men of 21st assisted in the escape of a slave belonging to Maryland Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks . While the slave was hidden in a chimney in one of the Naval Academy barracks , Governor Hicks 's repeated demands for his return were refused by the officers of the regiment . 
 On December 20 , 1861 , the 21st was assigned to the Coast Division commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside for operations in North Carolina . The 21st was the first regiment selected by Brig. Gen. Jesse Reno for his brigade . The 21st Massachusetts would gain a great respect and affection for Reno , who first led their brigade and later the IX Corps of which the 21st was a part . 
 = = North Carolina = = 
 As the regiment prepared for departure , Colonel Augustus Morse decided to remain at the Naval Academy , feeling that garrison duty was , according to historian James Bowen , " more to his taste . " Lt. Col. Albert Maggi , an Italian by birth who had served under Giuseppe Garibaldi , took command of the regiment on January 2 , 1862 . Maggi had been openly insubordinate to Morse due to the latter 's lack of military discipline . His assumption of command , as well as the issue of new Enfield rifled muskets , improved the morale of the regiment . 
 The 21st , about 960 strong , boarded the steamer Northerner on January 6 , 1862 . The fleet transporting Burnside 's North Carolina Expedition encountered harsh weather off the coast of Cape Hatteras . Prolonged poor weather and the shallowness of Hatteras Inlet resulted in weeks of delay as the fleet struggled to enter Pamlico Sound . Finally , just as most of the vessels began to run low on potable water , the fleet entered the sound and made for Roanoke Island on February 5 , 1862 . 
 = = = Battle of Roanoke Island = = = 
 Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan had ordered Burnside to make Roanoke Island his first target . Capture of the island would allow control of both Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds , opening up a possible southern invasion route to Richmond . Coordinating with a naval flotilla commanded by Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough , Burnside launched an amphibious assault ( one of the first of the Civil War ) resulting in the Battle of Roanoke Island on February 7 and 8 , 1862 . As the landing boats , each flying a national flag and packed with soldiers , made for the shore , Burnside noted that he had , " never seen a more beautiful sight . " After the landing , the 21st spent a cold , wet night on picket duty . On February 8 , it joined in the assault on the Confederate fort at the center of the island . Moving through swamps and knee @-@ deep water , Reno 's brigade , including the 21st , advanced around the Union left flank on the west side of the fort . After firing steadily on the fort for some time and taking moderate casualties , the 21st was ordered by Brig. Gen. Reno to storm the fort . According to the regimental historian , the 21st Massachusetts was the first regiment to mount the earthworks of the fort ; however , the honor was also claimed by the 9th New York . The Union forces were victorious in capturing the Confederate fort on Roanoke Island and took approximately 2 @,@ 500 Confederate soldiers prisoner . The 21st suffered 13 killed and 44 wounded , or eight percent casualties , during the engagement . 
 After the battle , the 21st took up camp in the former Confederate fort , remaining there for nearly a month . During that time , Lt. Col. Maggi , determined to make the 21st as disciplined as a regiment of Regulars , enforced stern standards for drill and dress parades . After the near mutiny of one company , Maggi submitted his resignation . Maj. William S. Clark , a professor of chemistry at Amherst College , was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the regiment on February 28 , 1862 . 
 = = = Battle of New Bern = = = 
 Burnside 's next target , according to McClellan 's orders , was the city of New Bern , North Carolina . The Coast Division boarded their transports on March 4 , made their way up the Neuse River , and disembarked about 16 miles ( 26 km ) down river of New Bern on March 12 . The 21st , numbering 675 men , led their brigade in the march on New Bern , discovering many abandoned fortifications . On March 14 , the division participated in the Battle of New Bern . The Confederate defenses were roughly centered on a brick yard converted into a makeshift fort . The 21st , approaching the enemy position , was soon ordered to assault the brick yard and the battery therein . Lt. Col. Clark led four companies of the 21st and temporarily occupied the brick yard . As they captured the battery , Clark stood atop one of the guns , urging his men forward . In their advanced position , the 21st suffered significant casualties and was soon forced to abandon the brickyard . However , the Union forces were eventually victorious , and the city of New Bern was captured . After the battle , Maj. Gen. Burnside presented the first cannon captured by the 21st to Amherst College in honor of 1st Lt. <unk> Stearns , son of the President of Amherst College , and adjutant of the 21st , who was killed during the engagement . Lt. Col. Clark received a promotion to colonel for his conduct during the Battle of New Bern . The regiment suffered 58 casualties , or eight percent ( 23 killed , 35 wounded ) . 
 = = = Battle of Camden = = = 
 Following the engagement at New Bern , the 21st was among the regiments selected for an expedition to destroy the Dismal Swamp Canal which would cripple the Confederacy 's shipbuilding activities at Norfolk , Virginia . A portion of Reno 's brigade was transported by steamers to Camden County and engaged in the relatively minor Battle of Camden on April 19 , 1862 . The 21st , at this stage , numbered 500 men , having lost numerous soldiers to disease while in an unsanitary camp at New Bern . After the Battle of Camden , Reno eventually abandoned the expedition against the canal and the brigade returned to New Bern on April 22 . In the course of the mission , the 21st Massachusetts had light casualties of three percent ( four killed , 11 wounded , and one missing ) . 
 = = Northern Virginia Campaign = = 
 The Coast Division 's next assignment was supposed to be the capture of Wilmington , North Carolina . However , the failure of McClellan 's Peninsular Campaign required the recall of the Coast Division to Virginia . The 21st broke their camp in New Bern and boarded schooners on July 2 , 1862 , while hearing conflicting rumors of McClellan 's success or defeat . They arrived in Newport News , Virginia , on July 9 . 
 During July , two additional divisions were consolidated under Maj. Gen. Burnside 's command to form the IX Corps . At the beginning of August , Brig. Gen Jesse Reno assumed the command of the Corps and was ordered to support the advance of Maj. Gen. John Pope 's Army of Virginia towards Richmond . The 21st , along with the rest of the Corps , was quickly transported to Fredericksburg and then marched overland to join Pope 's forces on August 14 , 1862 , in the vicinity of Culpeper Court House , Virginia . 
 As Gen. Robert E. Lee advanced on Pope 's position along the Rapidan River , Pope quickly withdrew his army north . The brigade to which the 21st belonged , now commanded by Col. Edward Ferrero , frequently found itself in the position of rear guard during this movement , skirmishing with the advancing Confederate cavalry . By the time the 21st reached Warrenton , Virginia , on August 27 , it was clear to the men that something was wrong . Pope was seen riding by the regiment , " looking warm and excited " , and the men learned that Lt. Gen. Thomas Jackson had flanked the Union army and was now in their rear . 
 = = = Second Battle of Bull Run = = = 
 The 21st , now numbering 425 men , crossed Bull Run on August 29 and discovered that Union forces had already engaged Jackson 's men in the Second Battle of Bull Run . Just after noon , the 21st 's brigade took up a position near the center of the Union lines . Over the course of the afternoon they witnessed several brigades advance into the woods in their front only to see them beaten back by the Confederates . Finally , the order came for Ferrero 's brigade , including the 21st , to advance , unsupported , into the woods . As the brigade stepped off , Brig. Gen. Reno ordered it to halt and personally protested the order to Maj. Gen. Pope . The order was rescinded and , according to Capt. Walcott of the 21st , " we thanked God that General Reno stood between us and General Pope . " 
 After resting on their arms through the night , the 21st awoke to light fighting in their front . Over the course of the morning , Union forces gradually shifted to the left , including the 21st , and it became apparent that the Union right flank had collapsed . Meanwhile , Lee 's forces had joined Jackson 's and were pressing the Union left flank with a massive and rapid assault . Pope 's entire army was soon in retreat . Ferrero 's brigade was moved by Brig. Gen. Reno to a position on Henry House Hill to cover the Union retreat along the Centreville Turnpike . The brigade , with the 21st in the center , successfully held off Confederate advances from 7 to 9 pm , buying critical time for the Union army . Finally , under the cover of darkness , the brigade quietly retired across Bull Run . During this defeat for the Union army , the 21st suffered light casualties of seven wounded , or two percent . 
 = = = Battle of Chantilly = = = 
 As the Union army retreated towards Washington , it paused to re @-@ group at Centreville , Virginia . On August 31 , 1862 , Gen. Lee ordered Lt. Gen. Jackson to flank the Union right and to cut the Union army off from Washington . This flanking effort resulted in the Battle of Chantilly which would prove to be the most disastrous engagement of the entire war for the 21st Massachusetts .
