 Parties opposed to the Liberal Democratic Party , which was in control of the government at the time Obuchi was prime minister , strongly objected to the government 's meaning of kimi and " Kimigayo " . From the Democratic Party of Japan , members objected due to the lack of any historical ties to the meaning . The strongest critic was Kazuo Shii , the chairman of the Communist Party of Japan , who strongly claimed that " Japan " could not be derived from " Kimigayo " because the lyrics only mention wishing for the emperor for a long reign . Shii also objected to the use of the song as the national anthem because for a democratic nation , a song about the emperor is not appropriate .

 The lyrics first appeared in the Kokin Wakashū , a poetry anthology , as an anonymous poem . The poem was included in many anthologies , and was used in a later period as a celebration song of a long life by people of all social statures . Unlike the form used for the current national anthem , the poem originally began with " Waga Kimi wa " ( ' you , my lord ' ) instead of " <unk> Yo wa " ( ' your reign ' ) . The first lyrics were changed during the Kamakura period , while the rest of the lyrics stayed the same . Because the lyrics were sung on formal occasions , such as birthdays , there was no sheet music for it until the 19th century . 
 In 1869 , John William Fenton , a visiting Irish military band leader , realized there was no national anthem in Japan , and suggested to Iwao Ōyama , an officer of the Satsuma Clan , that one be created . Ōyama agreed , and selected the lyrics . The lyrics may have been chosen for their similarity to the British national anthem , due to Fenton 's influence . After selecting the anthem 's lyrics , Ōyama then asked Fenton to create the melody . After being given just two to three weeks to compose the melody and only a few days to rehearse , Fenton debuted the anthem before the Japanese Emperor in 1870 . This was the first version of " Kimigayo " , which was discarded because the melody " lacked solemnity . " However , this version is still performed annually at the <unk> temple in Yokohama , where Fenton served as a military band leader . <unk> serves as a memorial to him . 
 In 1880 , the Ministry of the Imperial Household adopted a new melody composed by <unk> Oku and Akimori Hayashi . The composer is often listed as <unk> Hayashi , who was their supervisor and Akimori 's father . Akimori was also one of Fenton 's pupils . Although the melody is based on a traditional mode of Japanese court music , it is composed in a mixed style influenced by Western hymns , and uses some elements of the Fenton arrangement . The German musician Franz Eckert applied the melody with Western style harmony , creating the second and current version of " Kimigayo " . The government formally adopted " Kimigayo " as the national anthem in 1888 and had copies of the music and lyrics sent overseas for diplomatic ceremonies . By 1893 , " Kimigayo " was included in public school ceremonies due to the efforts of the then Ministry of Education . 
 At the turn of the 20th century , " Kimigayo " was beginning to be closely associated with the idea of honoring the Emperor . It was also associated as a part of Japanese education . However , opinions expressed in an Osaka paper in 1904 calls " Kimigayo " a song for the imperial family and not the state as a whole . Uchimura <unk> , a Christian leader in Japan , stated at the turn of the 20th century that " Kimigayo " is not the anthem of Japan by saying the song 's purpose is to praise the emperor . According to <unk> , a national anthem should express the feelings of the people . The Japanese were not familiar with " Kimigayo " as the anthem until there was a surge of celebrations after victories in the First Sino @-@ Japanese and Russo @-@ Japanese Wars . Previously , papers were critical of fellow Japanese who could not sing " Kimigayo " properly at ceremonies overseas .

 During the American occupation of Japan , there were no directives by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers to restrict the use of " Kimigayo " by the Japanese government . This was different from the regulations issued that restricted the use of the Hinomaru flag . Along with the encouragement to use " Kimigayo " in the schools to promote defense education and patriotism , the national broadcaster NHK began to use the song to announce the start and ending of its programming .

 The Act on National Flag and Anthem was passed in 1999 , choosing both the Hinomaru and " Kimigayo " as Japan 's national symbols . The passage of the law stemmed from a suicide of a school principal in Hiroshima who could not resolve a dispute between his school board and his teachers over the use of the Hinomaru and " Kimigayo " . 
 Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi of the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) decided to draft legislation to make the Hinomaru and " Kimigayo " official symbols of Japan in 2000 . His Chief Cabinet Secretary , Hiromu Nonaka , wanted the legislation to be completed by the 10th anniversary of the coronation of Akihito as Emperor . This is not the first time legislation was considered for establishing both symbols as official . In 1974 , with the backdrop of the 1972 return of Okinawa to Japan and the 1973 oil crisis , Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei hinted at a law being passed legalizing both symbols . 
 Main supporters of the bill were the LDP and the Komeito ( <unk> ) , while the opposition included the Social Democratic Party ( <unk> ) and Communist Party ( CPJ ) , who cited the connotations both symbols had with the war era . The CPJ was further opposed for not allowing the issue to be decided by the public . Meanwhile , the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) could not develop party consensus on it . President of the DPJ , Naoto Kan stated that the DPJ must support the bill because the party already recognized both symbols as the symbols of Japan . Deputy Secretary General and future prime minister Yukio Hatoyama thought that this bill would cause further divisions among society and the public schools . 
 Before the vote , there were calls for the bills to be separated at the Diet . Waseda University professor Norihiro Kato stated that " Kimigayo " is a separate issue more complex than the Hinomaru flag . Attempts to designate only the Hinomaru as the national flag by the DPJ and other parties during the vote of the bill were rejected by the Diet . The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 22 , 1999 , by a 403 to 86 vote . The legislation was sent to the House of Councilors on July 28 and was passed on August 9 . It was enacted into law on August 13 .

 The lyrics and musical notation of the anthem are given in the second appendix of the Act on National Flag and Anthem . As for the sheet music itself , it displays a vocal arrangement with no mention of tempo and all of the lyrics in hiragana . The anthem is composed in 4 / 4 ( common time ) in the Dorian mode . The Act on National Flag and Anthem does not detail how one should show respect during performances of " Kimigayo " . In a statement made by Prime Minister Obuchi , the legislation will not impose new regulations on the Japanese people when it comes to respecting the flag or anthem . However , local government bodies and private organizations sometimes suggest or demand certain protocols be followed . For example , an October 2003 directive by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government required teachers to stand during the national anthem at graduation ceremonies . While standing , the teachers are required to sing " Kimigayo " while facing the Hinomaru . United States military personnel are required by regulations to render honors with a hand salute , or when in civilian dress , to place their right hand over their heart when " Kimigayo " , The Star @-@ Spangled Banner , or any other national anthem is performed . The Act on National Flag and Anthem also does not dictate when or where " Kimigayo " should be played . The anthem , however , is commonly played at sporting events inside of Japan , or at international sporting events where Japan has a competing team . At <unk> tournaments , " Kimigayo " is played before the awards ceremony . 
 = = = Public schools = = = 
 Since the end of World War II , the Ministry of Education has issued statements and regulations to promote the usage of both the Hinomaru and " Kimigayo " at schools under their jurisdiction . The first of these statements was released in 1950 , stating that it was desirable , but not required , to use both symbols . This desire was later expanded to include both symbols on national holidays and during ceremonial events to encourage students on what national holidays are and to promote defense education . The Ministry not only took great measures to explain that both symbols are not formally established by law , they also referred to " Kimigayo " as a song and refused to call it the national anthem . It was not until 1977 that the Ministry referred to " Kimigayo " as the national anthem ( <unk> , <unk> ) of Japan . In a 1989 reform of the education guidelines , the LDP @-@ controlled government first demanded that the Hinomaru flag must be used in school ceremonies and that proper respect must be given to it and to " Kimigayo " . Punishments for school officials who did not follow this order were also enacted with the 1989 reforms . 
 The 1999 curriculum guideline issued by the Ministry of Education after the passage of the Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem decrees that " on entrance and graduation ceremonies , schools must raise the flag of Japan and instruct students to sing the " Kimigayo " ( national anthem ) , given the significance of the flag and the song . " Additionally , the ministry 's commentary on 1999 curriculum guideline for elementary schools note that " given the advance of internationalization , along with fostering patriotism and awareness of being Japanese , it is important to nurture school children 's respectful attitude toward the flag of Japan and " Kimigayo " as they grow up to be respected Japanese citizens in an internationalized society . " The ministry also stated that if Japanese students cannot respect their own symbols , then they will not be able to respect the symbols of other nations . 
 = = Present @-@ day perception = = 
 According to a survey conducted by TV Asahi , most Japanese people perceived " Kimigayo " as an important song even before the passage of the Act on National Flag and Anthem in 1999 . However , a poll in the same year conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun found that most respondents opposed legislation making it the national anthem or felt the Diet should take more time in passing such a law . Many Japanese students , who must sing the song at entrance and graduation ceremonies , say they cannot understand the old language of the lyrics and are not educated on its historical uses . Controversies surrounding the use of the anthem in school events still remain . 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 = = Controversies = = 
 Schools have been the center of controversy over both the anthem and the national flag . The Tokyo Board of Education requires the use of both the anthem and flag at events under their jurisdiction . The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs . In 1999 , several teachers in Hiroshima refused to put up the anthem while the Hiroshima Education Board demanded that they do so . As the tension arose between them , a vice @-@ principal committed suicide . A similar incident in Osaka in 2010 also occurred , with 32 teachers refusing to sing the song in a ceremony . In 2011 , 9 more teachers joined the rebellion , along with another 8 in 2012 . Hashimoto Toru , the mayor of Osaka , slated the teachers as “ It was good that criminals ( teachers ) who are intent on breaking the rules ( of not singing the anthem ) have risen to the surface ( public ) ” . Some have protested that such rules violate the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the " freedom of thought , belief and conscience " clause in the Constitution of Japan , but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies , their employees have an obligation to teach their students how to be good Japanese citizens . Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Tokyo Governor Shintarō Ishihara and senior officials for ordering teachers to honor the Hinomaru and " Kimigayo " . After earlier opposition , the Japan Teachers Union accepts the use of both the flag and anthem ; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system . 
 In 2006 , Katsuhisa Fujita , a retired teacher in Tokyo , was threatened with imprisonment and fined 200 @,@ 000 yen ( roughly 2 @,@ 000 US dollars ) after he was accused of disturbing a graduation ceremony at <unk> High School by urging the attendees to remain seated during the playing of the anthem . At the time of Fujita 's sentence , 345 teachers had been punished for refusing to take part in anthem related events , though Fujita is the only man to have been convicted in relation to it . On September 21 , 2006 , the Tokyo District Court ordered the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to pay compensation to the teachers who had been subjected to punishment under the directive of the Tokyo Board of Education . The then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi commented , " It is a natural idea to treat the national anthem importantly " . The ruling has been appealed by the Metropolitan Government . Since October 23 , 2003 , 410 teachers and school workers have been punished for refusing to stand and sing the anthem as ordered by school principals . Teachers can also be punished if their students do not stand while " Kimigayo " is played during school ceremonies . 
 On 30 May 2011 and 6 June 2011 , two panels of the Supreme Court of Japan ruled that it was constitutional to require teachers to stand in front of the Hinomaru and sing the Kimigayo during school ceremonies . In making the ruling , the panels ratified the decision of the Tokyo High Court in ruling against 13 teachers who had asked for court relief after being disciplined between 2003 and 2005 for refusing to stand and sing the anthem . 
 Outside of the school system , there was a controversy regarding " Kimigayo " soon after the passage of the 1999 law . A month after the law 's passage , a record containing a performance of " Kimigayo " by Japanese rocker <unk> <unk> was removed by Polydor Records from his album Fuyu no <unk> . Polydor did not want a record to stir up emotion in Japan . In response , <unk> re @-@ released the album through an independent label with the track in question .

 White Pines Forest State Park , more commonly referred to as White Pines State Park , is an Illinois state park in Ogle County , Illinois . It is located near the communities of Polo , Mount Morris and Oregon . The 385 @-@ acre ( 156 ha ) park contains the southernmost remaining stand of native white pine trees in the state of Illinois , and that area , 43 acres ( 17 ha ) , was designated an Illinois Nature Preserve in 2001 . 
 The area was poised to become a state park in 1903 , but a veto by Governor Richard Yates prevented that from occurring . Supporters continued to press for the White Pines Woods , as it was once known , to receive state park designation throughout the period 1903 @-@ 1927 . In 1927 the park was established with help from supporters in the Chicago media . The park contains two freshwater streams , dolomite rock formations , and a variety of activities generally associated with Illinois state parks . Along Pine Creek , one of the park 's two streams , fords were constructed instead of bridges allowing visitors to drive through the creek .

 = = = Early history = = = 
 White Pines Forest State Park is located in what was once a part of the Sauk leader Black Hawk 's territory and encompasses an area once known as White Pines Woods . White Pines State Park nearly became an Illinois State Park as early as 1903 , when the state established its first state park at Fort Massac . Members of the Oregon , Illinois Woman 's Council started the process by lobbying the Illinois legislature to set aside White Pines Woods as a state park . In 1903 the Illinois legislature appropriated US $ 30 @,@ 000 for the purchase of White Pines Woods , the southernmost stand of virgin , native white pine trees in the state . The move was stalled when then @-@ Illinois Governor Richard Yates vetoed the measure , citing costs . After 1903 and before 1927 ( when the state park was established ) , the " Pines Woods Bill " was introduced several times without success . The designation of Starved Rock State Park in 1912 reportedly frustrated the supporters of White Pines Woods ' designation as a state park . 
 The influential Friends of Our Native Landscape included the area around the Rock River between Dixon and Oregon on a list of 20 places in Illinois that should be designated state parks . Located in " Rock River country , " along an old Indian trail , was White Pines Woods covering 500 acres ( 200 ha ) in a canyon of dolomite rock carved by Pine Creek . At the time , within White Pines Woods , the tallest trees stood 90 feet ( 27 m ) in height . The area was noted by Elia W. Peattie , a poet and member of the Eagle 's Nest Art Colony ( located at present @-@ day Lowden State Park ) , who expressed the need for preservation of the White Pines Woods in one of her poems . 
 The Illinois Board of State Park Advisers was established under a 1925 state law . The law , which was amended in 1931 , gave the director of the Illinois Department of Public Works jurisdiction over the state parks . The Public Works position was a result of 1917 reforms by Governor Frank Lowden . The law also mandated a system of state parks , under the Illinois Department of Conservation , later renamed the Illinois Department of Natural Resources . Per the 1925 mandate , White Pines Forest became a state park in 1927 after its proponents enlisted the support of the Chicago Tribune and WGN Radio . That year , Governor Len Small moved to purchase White Pines for $ 63 @,@ 949 .

 In 1933 , with the Great Depression in full swing , the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) sought to relieve the work needs of unemployed Americans . The National Park Service sought to work with state governments in an effort to meet those ends . Many of the projects the CCC was involved with were construction projects . The project at White Pines was originally meant to be the construction of a lodge building . From 1933 to 1939 , two hundred men , many of them World War I veterans , worked on the State Park construction project . 
 After the lodge was completed , it was decided to build a restaurant and breezeway onto the lodge building . Logs for most of the project were shipped via railroad from as far away as Oregon and Washington state , unloaded in Stratford , Illinois and dragged to the construction site by teams of horses . The CCC project also completed sixteen one @-@ room log cabins and three four @-@ bedroom cabins . The work crews also built picnic shelters , trail shelters , and foot bridges . Only the logs for the cabins came from another source . They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece .

 In September 2001 the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission dedicated a 43 @-@ acre ( 17 ha ) section of the state park at White Pines Forest as Illinois ' 300th nature preserve . Nature preserve designation gave the stand of white pine trees in the park the highest form of legal protection in the state . The designation restricts activities to those that do not impact the area 's natural features such as hiking and birdwatching . Activities such as logging , farming , hunting , and fishing are all prohibited within Illinois Nature Preserves , though in some cases there are exceptions for hunting and fishing .

 White Pines State Park is a 385 @-@ acre ( 156 ha ) state park located in the heart of the Rock River Valley in Ogle County . The park represents the southernmost remaining stand of virgin white pine forest in the state . The state park , like all Illinois state parks , is operated and maintained by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources ( IDNR ) . White Pines Forest State Park provides habitat for a variety of plant and animal life and has two freshwater streams within its boundaries . 
 Among the park 's most distinctive and well @-@ known features are the vehicular river crossings . At three places , crossing Pine Creek , fords were constructed instead of bridges . The fords offer visitors a chance to actually drive through the creek , though high water frequently closes the crossings . Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream . Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek , a large watershed to the north of the park , that there is an emergency exit from the campground . When high water closes the fords , the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out .

 The banks of Pine Creek and Spring Creek are lined with large rock and cliff formations that provide habitat to plants ranging from large trees to moss to hanging vines . The cliffs harbor plants rare in the state of Illinois such as Canada yew and <unk> ( family <unk> ) , an Illinois state @-@ threatened species . When in season , the park 's many species of wildflowers bloom , some of the flowers found in the park include : trout lily , Solomon 's seal , bloodroot , blue @-@ eyed grass , spring beauty , and hepatica . The forest undergrowth provides small mammal habitat and among the mammals that can be seen in the park are : red squirrels , raccoons , deer , and chipmunks . Birds include , the pine thrush , warblers , wild turkey , and winter @-@ migratory birds . The creeks are populated with smallmouth bass , rock bass , channel catfish and , when they are stocked by the IDNR , rainbow trout .

The lodge and cabins are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places . The 25 cabins are operated by a privately owned entity , the White Pines Inn , and the lodge features a popular private restaurant . 
 White Pines has 103 campsites all accessible by vehicle ; the campgrounds are sometimes closed because of high water or soft ground .

 = Hours of service = 
 Hours of Service ( HOS ) regulations are issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ( FMCSA ) and govern the working hours of anyone operating a commercial motor vehicle ( CMV ) in the United States . These regulations apply to truck drivers , commercial and city bus drivers , and school bus drivers who operate CMVs . These rules limit the number of daily and weekly hours spent driving and working , and regulate the minimum amount of time drivers must spend resting between driving shifts . For intrastate commerce , the respective state 's regulations apply . 
 The FMCSA is a division of the United States Department of Transportation ( DOT ) , which is generally responsible for enforcement of FMCSA regulations . The driver of a CMV is required to keep a record of working hours using a log book , outlining the total number of hours spent driving and resting , as well as the time at which the change of duty status occurred . In lieu of a log book , a motor carrier may keep track of a driver 's hours using an electronic on @-@ board recorder ( EOBR ) , which automatically records the amount of time spent driving the vehicle . 
 The HOS 's main purpose is to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue . This is accomplished by limiting the number of driving hours per day , and the number of driving and working hours per week . Fatigue is also prevented by keeping drivers on a 21- to 24 @-@ hour schedule , maintaining a natural sleep / wake cycle ( or circadian rhythm ) . Drivers are required to take a daily minimum period of rest , and are allowed longer " weekend " rest periods to combat cumulative fatigue effects that accrue on a weekly basis . 
 Enforcement of the HOS is generally handled by DOT officers of each state , and are sometimes checked when CMVs pass through weigh stations . Drivers found to be in violation of the HOS can be forced to stop driving for a certain period of time , which may negatively affect the motor carrier 's safety rating . Requests to change the HOS are a source of contentious debate , and many surveys indicate some drivers get away with routinely violating the HOS . These facts have started another debate on whether motor carriers should be required to use EOBRs in their vehicles , instead of relying on paper @-@ based log books . 
 = = Purpose = = 
 Drivers subject to the HOS include any driver of a vehicle which has a gross vehicle weight of 10 @,@ 001 pounds ( 4 @,@ 536 kg ) or more ; which is designed or used to transport more than 8 passengers ( including the driver ) for compensation ; which is designed or used to transport more than 15 passengers ( including the driver ) and is not used to transport passengers for compensation ; or which is used to transport hazardous materials in quantities requiring the vehicle to be marked or placarded under the hazardous materials regulations . 
 The purpose of the HOS is to reduce accidents caused by driver fatigue . As the graph to the right illustrates , the number of hours spent driving has a strong correlation to the number of fatigue @-@ related accidents . According to numerous studies , the risk of fatigue is also greatest between the hours of midnight and six in the morning , and increases with the total length of the driver 's trip . 
 The FMCSA identifies three main factors in driver fatigue : Circadian rhythm effects , sleep deprivation and cumulative fatigue effects , and industrial or " time @-@ on @-@ task " fatigue . 
 Circadian rhythm effects describe the tendency for humans to experience a normal cycle in attentiveness and sleepiness through the 24 @-@ hour day . Those with a conventional sleep pattern ( sleeping for seven or eight hours at night ) experience periods of maximum fatigue in the early hours of the morning and a lesser period in the early afternoon . During the low points of this cycle , one experiences reduced attentiveness . During the high points , it is difficult to sleep soundly . The cycle is anchored in part by ambient lighting ( darkness causes a person 's body to release the hormone melatonin , which induces sleep ) , and by a person 's imposed pattern of regular sleeping and waking times . The influence of the day @-@ night cycle is never fully displaced ( standard artificial lighting is not strong enough to inhibit the release of melatonin ) , and the performance of night shift workers usually suffers . Circadian rhythms are persistent , and can only be shifted by one to two hours forward or backward per day . Changing the starting time of a work shift by more than these amounts will reduce attentiveness , which is common after the first night shift following a " weekend " break during which conventional sleep times were followed . 
 Sleep deprivation and cumulative fatigue effects describe how individuals who fail to have an adequate period of sleep ( 7 – 8 hours in 24 hours ) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 16 – 17 hours will suffer sleep deprivation . A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep @-@ deprived days , and additional fatigue may be caused by breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period of sleep . A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night 's sleep ; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance . 
 Industrial or " time @-@ on @-@ task " fatigue describes fatigue that is accumulated during the working period , and affects performance at different times during the shift . Performance declines the longer a person is engaged in a task , gradually during the first few hours and more steeply toward the end of a long period at work . Reduced performance has also been observed in the first hour of work as an individual adjusts to the working environment . 
 = = Definition of terms = = 
 Parts of a driver 's work day are defined in four terms : On @-@ duty time , off @-@ duty time , driving time , and sleeper berth time . 
 FMCSA regulation § 395 @.@ 2 states : 
 On @-@ duty time is all time from when a driver begins to work or is required to be in readiness to work until the driver is relieved from work and all responsibility for performing work . 
 On @-@ duty time includes : 
 All time at a plant , terminal , facility , or other property of a motor carrier or shipper , or on any public property , waiting to be dispatched , unless the driver has been relieved from duty by the motor carrier . 
 All time inspecting , servicing , or conditioning any CMV at any time . 
 Crossing a border 
 All driving time as defined in the term " driving time " . 
 All time , other than driving time , in or upon any CMV except time spent resting in a sleeper berth . 
 All time loading or unloading a CMV , supervising , or assisting in the loading or unloading , attending a CMV being loaded or unloaded , remaining in readiness to operate the CMV , or in giving or receiving receipts for shipments loaded or unloaded . 
 All time repairing , obtaining assistance , or remaining in attendance upon a disabled CMV . 
 All time spent providing a breath sample or urine specimen , including travel time to and from the collection site , to comply with the random , reasonable suspicion , post @-@ accident , or follow @-@ up drug testing . 
 Performing any other work in the capacity , employ , or service of a motor carrier . 
 Performing any compensated work for a person who is not a motor carrier . ( This rule does not explicitly forbid a driver from obtaining a second or part @-@ time job . It simply prevents a driver switching from a non @-@ driving job to a driving job without the required 10 hours of rest . ) 
 Driving time is all time spent at the driving controls of a CMV . 
 Sleeper berth time is any amount of time spent inside the sleeper berth ( e.g. , resting or sleeping ) . FMCSA regulation § 393 @.@ 76 gives the minimum requirements for a space to be defined as a sleeper berth . The simple definition is an area separate from ( usually immediately behind ) the driving controls that includes a bed . The rules do not explicitly require that a driver must sleep , only that a driver must take a period of " rest " within the sleeper berth or off @-@ duty ( i.e. , home ) . A statement made by the ICC in 1937 gives the reason : " We have no control over the manner in which a driver may spend his time off @-@ duty , although some of his spare time activities may tire him as much as any work would do . We can only emphasize , by this comment , the responsibility which is the driver 's own to assure himself of adequate rest and sleep , in the time available for this purpose , to ensure safety of his driving , and likewise the employer 's responsibility to see that his drivers report for work in fit condition . " 
 Off @-@ duty time is any time not spent on @-@ duty , driving , or in the sleeper berth . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1938 , the now @-@ abolished Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) enforced the first HOS rules . Drivers were limited to 12 hours of work within a 15 @-@ hour period . Work was defined as loading , unloading , driving , handling freight , preparing reports , preparing vehicles for service , or performing any other duty pertaining to the transportation of passengers or property . The ICC intended the 3 @-@ hour difference between 15 hours on @-@ duty and 12 hours of work to be used for meals and rest breaks . The weekly maximum was limited to 60 hours over 7 days ( non @-@ daily drivers ) , or 70 hours over 8 days ( daily drivers ) . These rules allowed for 12 hours of work within a 15 @-@ hour period , 9 hours of rest , with 3 hours for breaks within a 24 @-@ hour day . 
 Within a short time , however , representatives of organized labor ( including the American Federation of Labor , the Teamsters , and the International Association of <unk> ) petitioned for a stay of the original regulations . A few motor carriers made a similar request . The ICC agreed , and oral arguments were heard again . Labor wanted HOS limits of 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week . The ICC commented " there was no statistical or other information which would enable [ them ] to say definitely how long a driver can safely work . " 
 Within six months of the original ruling , the ICC ultimately decided to change the 12 @-@ hour work limit in 24 hours to a 10 @-@ hour driving limit in 24 hours , and the 15 @-@ hour on @-@ duty limit was rescinded . Motor carriers were required to give drivers 8 , rather than 9 , consecutive hours off @-@ duty each day . These rules allowed for 10 hours of driving and 8 hours of rest within a 24 @-@ hour day . 
 In 1962 , for reasons it never clearly explained , the ICC eliminated the 24 @-@ hour cycle rule , and reinstated the 15 @-@ hour on @-@ duty limit . With 10 hours of driving and 8 hours of sleep , drivers were allowed to maintain an 18 @-@ hour cycle , disrupting the driver 's natural 24 @-@ hour circadian rhythm . This change allowed up to 16 hours of driving per day , allowing the driver to exhaust their weekly limits in as little as five days . Later , an added exception for trucks equipped with sleeper berths meant drivers were allowed to " split " their 8 @-@ hour off @-@ duty time into two parts . With the new splitting provision , a driver could take two 4 @-@ hour periods of rest . Using one of these short rest periods would effectively " stop the on @-@ duty clock " , allowing the driver to split the 15 @-@ hour on @-@ duty time limit into two parts as well . These rules allowed for 10 hours of work within a 15 @-@ hour time limit , and 8 hours of rest within an 18 @-@ hour day . 
 Between 1962 and 2003 , there were numerous proposals to change the HOS again , but none were ever finalized . By this time , the ICC had been abolished , and regulations were now issued by the FMCSA . The 2003 changes applied only to property @-@ carrying drivers ( i.e. , truck drivers ) . These rules allowed 11 hours of driving within a 14 @-@ hour period , and required 10 hours of rest . These changes would allow drivers ( using the entire 14 @-@ hour on @-@ duty period ) to maintain a natural 24 @-@ hour cycle , with a bare minimum 21 @-@ hour cycle ( 11 hours driving , 10 hours rest ) . However , the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow drivers to maintain irregular , short @-@ burst sleeping schedules . 
 The most notable change of 2003 was the introduction of the " 34 @-@ hour restart . " Before the change , drivers could only gain more weekly driving hours with the passing of each day ( which reduced their 70 @-@ hour total by the number of hours driven on the earliest day of the weekly cycle ) . After the change , drivers were allowed to " reset " their weekly 70 @-@ hour limit to zero , by taking 34 consecutive hours off @-@ duty . This provision was introduced to combat the cumulative fatigue effects that accrue on a weekly basis , and to allow for two full nights of rest ( e.g. , during a weekend break ) . 
 In 2005 , the FMCSA changed the rules again , practically eliminating the split sleeper berth provision . Drivers are now required to take a full 8 hours of rest , with 2 hours allowed for off @-@ duty periods , for a total of 10 hours off @-@ duty . This provision forced drivers to take one longer uninterrupted period of rest , but eliminated the flexibility of allowing drivers to take naps during the day without jeopardizing their driving time . Today 's rule still allows them to " split " the sleeper berth period , but one of the splits must be 8 hours long and the remaining 2 hours do not stop the 14 @-@ hour on @-@ duty period . This rule is confusing and impractical for most drivers , resulting in the majority of drivers taking the full 10 @-@ hour break . 
 In the years since 2005 , groups such as Public Citizen Litigation Group , Parents Against Tired Truckers ( PATT ) , Owner @-@ Operator Independent Drivers Association ( <unk> ) , Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways ( CRASH , which has merged with PATT ) , and the American Trucking Associations ( ATA ) , have been working to change the HOS again . Each group has their own ideas about what should be changed , and different agendas on why the rules should be changed . 
 = = Property @-@ carrying vehicles = = 
 FMCSA rules prohibit driving a property @-@ carrying CMV ( e.g. , trucks ) more than 11 hours or to drive after having been on @-@ duty for 14 hours . The 3 @-@ hour difference between the 11 @-@ hour driving limit and the 14 @-@ hour on @-@ duty limit gives drivers the opportunity to take care of non @-@ driving working duties such as loading and unloading cargo , fueling the vehicle , and required vehicle inspections , as well as non @-@ working duties such as meal and rest breaks . After completing an 11- to 14 @-@ hour on @-@ duty period , the driver must be allowed 10 hours off @-@ duty . 
 FMCSA rules prohibit drivers from operating a CMV after having been on @-@ duty 60 hours in 7 consecutive days ( if the motor carrier does not operate CMVs every day of the week ) , or after having been on @-@ duty 70 hours in 8 consecutive days ( if the motor carrier operates CMVs every day of the week ) . 
 After accumulating , for example , 70 hours of driving and on @-@ duty time within a period of 8 days , a driver 's daily driving limit may be reduced ( 70 / 8 = 8 @.@ 75 driving hours per day ) . A driver may be allowed ( but not required ) to take 34 hours off @-@ duty to reset the weekly total back to zero ( also known as a " 34 @-@ hour restart " ) . 
 = = Passenger @-@ carrying vehicles = = 
 FMCSA rules prohibit driving a passenger @-@ carrying CMV ( e.g. , commercial and city buses , passenger vans , and school buses ) for more than 10 hours , or to drive after having been on @-@ duty for 15 hours . The 5 @-@ hour difference between the 10 @-@ hour driving limit and the 15 @-@ hour on @-@ duty limit gives drivers the opportunity to take care of non @-@ driving work @-@ related duties such as loading and unloading of passengers and luggage , and fueling the vehicle , as well as non @-@ working duties such as meal and rest breaks . After completing a 10 to 15 @-@ hour on @-@ duty period , the driver must be allowed 8 hours off @-@ duty . 
 The FMCSA weekly hours limitations for passenger @-@ carrying vehicles are identical to those for property @-@ carrying vehicles . 
 After accumulating , for example , 60 hours of driving and on @-@ duty time within a period of 7 days , a driver 's daily driving limit may be reduced ( 60 / 7 = 8 @.@ 57 driving hours per day ) . The driver of a passenger @-@ carrying vehicle may not use the 34 @-@ hour restart provision . 
 = = Log book = = 
 Every driver of a CMV is required to keep track of his / her time with a log book or an EOBR . A log book is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on every page , dividing the 24 @-@ hour day into 15 @-@ minute ( 1 / 4 @-@ hour ) segments . Drivers are required to make carbon copies of each page , so one page may be kept with the driver ( to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers ) , and so the other copy may be sent to the driver 's employer . 
 An electronic on @-@ board recorder can be thought of as an automated electronic log book . An EOBR records the same information as a manual paper log book , and requires less input from the driver . The EOBR automatically records driving time and location , leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on @-@ duty and off @-@ duty time . In these respects , the EOBR is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book . 
 FMCSA rules require that a log book ( or EOBR ) must record for each change of duty status ( e.g. , the place of reporting for work , or starting to drive ) , the name of the city , town or village , with state abbreviation . If a change of duty status occurs at a location other than a city , the highway number and nearest milepost or the nearest two intersecting roadways followed by the name of the nearest city must be recorded . In addition to the time grid , a log book must record the date , total miles driven for the day , truck and trailer number , name of carrier , bill of lading number , and the driver 's signature . The driver is required to retain a copy of each log page for the previous seven consecutive days which must be in his / her possession and available for inspection while on @-@ duty . 
 = = Exceptions = = 
 There are numerous exceptions to these rules , some of these include but are not limited to : 
 During adverse weather or emergency driving conditions , drivers are permitted to exceed the 11 hour maximum daily driving time . However , drivers may not extend the 14 hour on duty time . 
 Drivers who venture less than a 150 air @-@ mile radius from the work reporting location are not required to maintain log books ( but are not exempt from limits on driving time ) , provided their employers maintain accurate records of their driving time . 
 Drivers who start and stop their work day at the same location for at least the previous 5 work days may drive past the 14 hour mark , for an extra 2 hours , if 11 driving hours are not exceeded . The 16 @-@ hour rule extends the work day by two hours , but does not extend the allowable driving hours . The 16 @-@ hour rule may be invoked once per 34 hour reset , if the 5 day pattern has been established . The driver must be relieved from work after the 16th hour . 
 Drivers for oilfield operations in the petroleum industry , groundwater drilling operations , construction materials , and utility service vehicles are permitted to take a 24 @-@ hour restart . 
 Retail store drivers who venture less than a 100 air @-@ mile radius are allowed to exceed daily driving limits to make store deliveries from December 10 to December 25 , due to the demands of the Christmas shopping season . 
 Drivers in Alaska can drive up to 15 hours within a 20 @-@ hour period . 
 Drivers in Hawaii are not required to maintain log books , provided their employer keeps an accurate record of their driving time . 
 Drivers in California are allowed up to 12 driving hours and 16 on duty hours . 
 Drivers for theatrical or television motion picture productions are exempt if the driver operates within a 100 air @-@ mile radius of the location where the driver reports to and is released from work . These drivers may take an 8 @-@ hour break , and are allowed 15 hours on duty . 
 = = Enforcement = = 
 The HOS are issued , among other industry @-@ related regulations , by the FMCSA . In this instance , federal regulations apply only to interstate commerce . Commerce which does not involve the crossing of state lines is considered intrastate , and is under the jurisdiction of the respective state 's laws . However , most states have adopted intrastate regulations which are identical or very similar to the federal HOS regulations . 
 Enforcement of the HOS rules is generally handled by DOT officers of their respective states , although any ordinary police officer may inspect a driver 's log book . States are responsible for maintaining weigh stations commonly located at the borders between states , where drivers are pulled in for random vehicle inspections ( although some of the inspections are based on the motor carrier 's safety rating ) . Otherwise , a driver may be pulled over for random checks by police officers or DOT officials at any time . Drivers are required to maintain their log books to current status , and if inspections reveal any sort of discrepancy , drivers may be put " out of service " until the driver has accumulated enough off @-@ duty time to be back in compliance . Being put out of service means a driver may not drive his / her truck during the prescribed limit under risk of further penalty . Repeated violations can result in fines from $ 1 @,@ 000 to $ 11 @,@ 000 and a downgrade in the motor carrier 's safety rating . 
 Long @-@ haul drivers are normally paid by the mile , not by the hour . Legally , truck drivers are not required to receive overtime pay for hours worked in excess of the standard 40 @-@ hour work week . Some drivers may choose to violate the HOS to earn more money . Being paid by the mile , any work performed that is not actual driving is of no value to the driver , providing incentive to falsify the amount of time spent performing non @-@ driving duties . Drivers who falsify their log books often under @-@ report their non @-@ driving duties ( such as waiting to be loaded and unloaded ) which they are not paid for , and under @-@ report their driving time or total miles . Many drivers who receive mileage pay are not paid by logged miles or actual miles , instead , motor carriers use computer mapping software ( such as PC Miler ) or published mileage guides ( such as the Rand McNally Household Goods Carriers ' Bureau Mileage Guide ) . PATT suggests that paying all drivers by the hour would reduce HOS violations by removing the incentive to " cheat the system " by driving more miles than are being logged . Surveys by <unk> report 80 % of drivers are not paid for waiting times while loading and unloading , and the majority of those drivers log these times as off @-@ duty ( while regulations require they be logged as on @-@ duty ) . These same drivers reported they would log these times as on @-@ duty if they were paid reasonably for such delays . 
 Drivers can get away with this rule @-@ breaking due to their paper @-@ based log books . As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel , there is very little to stop them from forging their log books . There is very superficial oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact . Surveys indicate that between 25 % and 75 % of drivers violate the HOS . Other drivers maintain more than one log book , showing falsified versions to enforcement officers . 
 Trucking companies ( motor carriers ) can also play a role in HOS violations . Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers , or even encourage their drivers to do so . Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost @-@ cutting measure used mostly by non @-@ union , long haul carriers . Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers , and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules . To comply with the HOS , these companies would have to hire more drivers ( possibly driving up wages ) and purchase additional trucks and trailers . Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations . Due to this competition , carriers who choose to switch from non @-@ compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to their customers . 
 In 1999 , two trucking company officials were sentenced to federal prison for violating hours of service regulations . Charles <unk> Jr. and his brother , James <unk> were sentenced to four months in prison , eight months in home confinement , and one year of supervised release . Their company , C & J Trucking Company of Londonderry , New Hampshire , was placed on two years probation and fined $ 25 @,@ 000 ( the maximum amount ) . The sentences were the result of an investigation which began when one of the trucking company 's drivers was involved in a collision on Interstate 93 in Londonderry on Aug. 2 , 1995 , in which four individuals were killed . 
 Several private and public motor carriers such as Frito @-@ Lay , United Parcel Service , and Werner Enterprises , have voluntarily implemented electronic on @-@ board recorders to ensure drivers are in compliance with the federal regulations , to reduce the errors and hassles associated with paper log books , and to improve driver retention and recruitment . EOBRs automatically record the driving time and cannot be easily forged . Any violation of the HOS will automatically be recorded and reported to the company . The FMCSA is considering making EOBRs mandatory for all motor carriers . 
 = = <unk> the Hours of Service = = 
 Whereas the 11 and 14 hour rules are still in effect , drivers will also be required to take a 30 @-@ minute break after 8 hours of on duty time . The 34 hour restart provision will still be in effect . However , drivers will only be allowed 1 restart per week ( 168 hours ) . Up to 2 hours either side of a sleeper @-@ berth period while in the passenger seat will count as off @-@ duty . Drivers inside a parked CMV who are not in the sleeper berth must log it as on @-@ duty . 
 This regulation has been codified into the Final Rule , and will come into force on the 27th February 2013 ( for the additional Off Duty allowances ) and 1 July 2013 ( for the break rules , and restart limits ) . 
 HOS Final Rule On December 27 , 2011 ( 76 FR <unk> ) , FMCSA published a final rule amending its hours @-@ of @-@ service ( HOS ) regulations for drivers of property @-@ carrying commercial motor vehicles ( CMVs ) . The final rule adopted several changes to the HOS regulations , including a new provision requiring drivers to take a rest break during the work day under certain circumstances . Drivers may drive a CMV only if 8 hours or less have passed since the end of the driver ’ s last off @-@ duty or sleeper @-@ berth period of at least 30 minutes . FMCSA did not specify when drivers must take the 30 @-@ minute break , but the rule requires that they wait no longer than 8 hours after the last off @-@ duty or sleeper @-@ berth period of that length or longer to take the break . Drivers who already take shorter breaks during the work day could comply with the rule by taking one of the shorter breaks and extending it to 30 minutes . The new requirement took effect on July 1 , 2013 . 
 On August 2 , 2013 , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued its ruling on the Hours of Service litigation brought by the American Trucking Associations and Public Citizen . The Court upheld the 2011 Hours of Service regulations in all aspects except for the 30 @-@ minute break provision as it applies to short haul drivers . While the decision does not officially take effect until the mandate is issued 52 days after the decision ( unless a party files a petition for rehearing , either by the panel or en banc , or moves to stay the mandate pending the filing of a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court ) , FMCSA announces the Agency will immediately cease enforcement of the 30 @-@ minute rest break provision of the HOS rule against short @-@ haul operations . The Agency requests that its State enforcement partners also cease enforcement of this provision . States that do so will not be found in violation of the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program ( <unk> ) . <unk> <unk> Effective August 2 , 2013 , FMCSA will no longer enforce 49 CFR 395 @.@ 3 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( ii ) against any driver that qualifies for either of the “ short haul operations ” exceptions outlined in 49 CFR 395 @.@ 1 ( e ) ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) . The Agency requests that State and local enforcement agencies also refrain from enforcing the 30 @-@ minute rest break against these drivers . Specifically , the following drivers would not be subject to the 30 @-@ minute break requirement : • All drivers ( CDL and non @-@ CDL ) that operate within 150 air @-@ miles of their normal work reporting location and satisfy the time limitations and recordkeeping requirements of 395 @.@ 1 ( e ) ( 1 ) . 
 • Non @-@ CDL drivers that operate within a 150 air @-@ mile radius of the location where the driver reports for duty and satisfy the time limitations and recordkeeping requirements of 395 @.@ 1 
 = George S. Patton slapping incidents = 
 In early August 1943 , Lieutenant General George S. Patton slapped two United States Army soldiers under his command during the Sicily Campaign of World War II . Patton 's hard @-@ driving personality and lack of belief in the medical condition post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , then known as " battle fatigue " or " shell shock " , led to the soldiers becoming the subject of his ire in incidents on 3 and 10 August , when Patton struck and berated them after discovering they were patients at evacuation hospitals away from the front lines without apparent physical injuries . 
 Word of the incidents spread , eventually reaching Patton 's superior , General Dwight D. Eisenhower , who ordered him to apologize to the men . Patton 's actions were initially suppressed in the news until journalist Drew Pearson publicized them in the United States . While the U.S. Congress and the general public expressed both support and disdain for Patton 's actions , Eisenhower and Army Chief of Staff George Marshall opted not to fire Patton as a commander . He was nonetheless sidelined from combat command for almost a year . 
 Seizing the opportunity the predicament presented , Eisenhower used Patton as a decoy in Operation Fortitude , sending faulty intelligence to German agents that Patton was leading the Invasion of Europe . While Patton eventually returned to combat command in the European Theater in mid @-@ 1944 , the slapping incidents were seen by Eisenhower , Marshall , and other leaders to be examples of Patton 's brashness and impulsiveness . Patton 's career was halted as former subordinates such as Omar Bradley became his superiors . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Allied invasion of Sicily began on 10 July 1943 , with Lieutenant General George S. Patton landing 90 @,@ 000 men of the Seventh United States Army near Gela , Scoglitti , and Licata to support Bernard Montgomery 's British 8th Army landings to the north . Initially ordered to protect the British forces ' flank , Patton took Palermo after Montgomery 's forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy . Patton then set his sights on Messina . He sought an amphibious assault , but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in Santo Stefano until 8 August , by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy . Throughout the campaign , Patton 's troops were heavily engaged by German and Italian forces as they pushed across the island . By the end of the battle on 16 August , the 200 @,@ 000 @-@ man Seventh Army had suffered 7 @,@ 500 casualties , and had killed or captured 113 @,@ 000 Axis troops and destroyed 3 @,@ 500 vehicles . 
 Patton had already developed a reputation in the U.S. Army as an effective , successful , and hard @-@ driving commander , punishing subordinates for the slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well . As a way to promote an image that inspired his troops , Patton created a larger @-@ than @-@ life personality . He became known for his flashy dress , highly polished helmet and boots , and no @-@ nonsense demeanor . General Dwight D. Eisenhower , the commander of the Sicily operation and Patton 's friend and commanding officer , had long known of Patton 's colorful leadership style , and also knew that Patton was prone to impulsiveness and a lack of self @-@ restraint . 
 = = = Battle fatigue = = = 
 Prior to World War I , the U.S. Army considered the symptoms of battle fatigue to be cowardice or attempts to avoid combat duty . Soldiers who reported these symptoms received harsh treatment . At the time of the incidents , the two soldiers Patton slapped were believed to be suffering from " battle fatigue , " otherwise known as " shell shock " or " battle stress . " Today , this condition is characterized as a form of post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , which can result from prolonged severe exposure to death and destruction , among many other traumatic events . While the causes , symptoms , and effects of the condition were familiar to physicians by the time of the two incidents , it was generally less understood in military circles . 
 An important lesson from the Tunisia Campaign was that neuropsychiatric casualties had to be treated as soon as possible , and not evacuated from the combat zone . This was not done in the early stages of the Sicilian Campaign , and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to North Africa , with the result that treatment became complicated , and only 15 percent of them were returned to duty . As the campaign wore on , the system became better organized , and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty . 
 Some time before what would become known as the " slapping incident , " Patton spoke with Major General Clarence R. Huebner , the newly appointed commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division , in which the soldiers both served . Patton had asked Huebner for a status report . Huebner replied : " The front lines seem to be thinning out . There seems to be a very large number of ' malingerers ' at the hospitals , feigning illness in order to avoid combat duty . " For his part , Patton did not believe the condition was real . In a directive issued to commanders on 5 August , he forbade " battle fatigue " in the Seventh Army : 
 It has come to my attention that a very small number of soldiers are going to the hospital on the pretext that they are nervously incapable of combat . Such men are cowards and bring discredit on the army and disgrace to their comrades , whom they heartlessly leave to endure the dangers of battle while they , themselves , use the hospital as a means of escape . You will take measures to see that such cases are not sent to the hospital but dealt with in their units . Those who are not willing to fight will be tried by court @-@ martial for cowardice in the face of the enemy .

 = = = 3 August = = = 
 Private Charles H. Kuhl , of L Company , U.S. 26th Infantry Regiment , reported to an aid station of C Company , 1st Medical Battalion , on 2 August 1943 . Kuhl , who had been in the U.S. Army for eight months , had been attached to the 1st Infantry Division since 2 June 1943 . He was diagnosed with " exhaustion , " a diagnosis he had been given three times since the start of the campaign . From the aid station , he was evacuated to a medical company and given sodium amytal . Notes in his medical chart indicated " <unk> anxiety state , moderately severe ( soldier has been twice before in hospital within ten days . He can 't take it at the front , evidently . He is repeatedly returned . " ) Kuhl was transferred from the aid station to the 15th Evacuation Hospital near Nicosia for further evaluation . 
 Patton arrived at the hospital the same day , accompanied by a number of medical officers , as part of his tour of the U.S. II Corps troops . He spoke to some patients in the hospital , commending the physically wounded . He then approached Kuhl , who did not appear to be physically injured . Kuhl was sitting slouched on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers . When Patton asked Kuhl where he was hurt , Kuhl reportedly shrugged and replied that he was " nervous " rather than wounded , adding , " I guess I can 't take it . " Patton " immediately flared up , " slapped Kuhl across the chin with his gloves , then grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to the tent entrance . He shoved him out of the tent with a kick to his backside . <unk> " Don 't admit this son of a bitch , " Patton demanded that Kuhl be sent back to the front , adding , " You hear me , you gutless bastard ? You 're going back to the front . " 
 <unk> picked up Kuhl and brought him to a ward tent , where it was discovered he had a temperature of 102 @.@ 2 ° F ( 39 @.@ 0 ° C ) ; and was later diagnosed with malarial parasites . Speaking later of the incident , Kuhl noted " at the time it happened , [ Patton ] was pretty well worn out ... I think he was suffering a little battle fatigue himself . " Kuhl wrote to his parents about the incident , but asked them to " just forget about it . " That night , Patton recorded the incident in his diary : " [ I met ] the only errant coward I have ever seen in this Army . Companies should deal with such men , and if they shirk their duty , they should be tried for cowardice and shot . " 
 Patton was accompanied in this visit by Major General John P. Lucas , who saw nothing remarkable about the incident . After the war he wrote : 
 There are always a certain number of such <unk> in any Army , and I suppose the modern doctor is correct in classifying them as ill and treating them as such . However , the man with malaria doesn 't pass his condition on to his comrades as rapidly as does the man with cold feet nor does malaria have the lethal effect that the latter has . 
 Patton was heard by a war correspondent angrily denying the reality of shell shock , claiming that the condition was " an invention of the Jews . " 
 = = = 10 August = = = 
 Private Paul G. Bennett , 21 , of C Battery , U.S. 17th Field Artillery Regiment , 1st Infantry Division , was a four @-@ year veteran of the U.S. Army , and had served in the division since March 1943 . Records show he had no medical history until 6 August 1943 , when a friend was wounded in combat . According to a report , he " could not sleep and was nervous . " Bennett was brought to the 93rd Evacuation Hospital . In addition to having a fever , he exhibited symptoms of dehydration , including fatigue , confusion , and listlessness . His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers . 
 The shells going over him bothered him . The next day he was worried about his buddy and became more nervous . He was sent down to the rear echelon by a battery aid man and there the medical aid man gave him some medicine which made him sleep , but still he was nervous and disturbed . On the next day the medical officer ordered him to be evacuated , although the boy begged not to be evacuated because he did not want to leave his unit . — A medical officer describing Bennett 's condition 
 On 10 August , Patton entered the receiving tent of the hospital , speaking to the injured there . Patton approached Bennett , who was huddled and shivering , and asked what the trouble was . " It 's my nerves , " Bennett responded . " I can 't stand the shelling anymore . " Patton reportedly became enraged at him , slapping him across the face . He began yelling : " Your nerves , hell , you are just a goddamned coward . Shut up that goddamned crying . I won 't have these brave men who have been shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying . " Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again , knocking his helmet liner off , and ordered the receiving officer , Major Charles B. Etter , not to admit him . Patton then threatened Bennett , " You 're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed , but you 're going to fight . If you don 't , I 'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose . In fact , I ought to shoot you myself , you goddamned whimpering coward . " Upon saying this , Patton pulled out his pistol threateningly , prompting the hospital 's commander , Colonel Donald E. Currier , to physically separate the two . Patton left the tent , yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines . 
 As he toured the remainder of the hospital , Patton continued discussing Bennett 's condition with Currier . Patton stated , " I can 't help it , it makes my blood boil to think of a yellow bastard being <unk> , " and " I won 't have those cowardly bastards hanging around our hospitals . We 'll probably have to shoot them some time anyway , or we 'll raise a breed of morons . "

 The 10 August incident — particularly the sight of Patton threatening a subordinate with a pistol — upset many of the medical staff present . The II Corps surgeon , Colonel Richard T. <unk> , submitted a report on the incident to Brigadier General William B. Kean , chief of staff of II Corps , who submitted it to Lieutenant General Omar Bradley , commander of II Corps . Bradley , out of loyalty to Patton , did nothing more than lock the report in his safe . <unk> also sent the report through medical channels to Brigadier General Frederick A. Blesse , General Surgeon of Allied Force Headquarters , who then submitted it to Eisenhower , who received it on 16 August . Eisenhower ordered Blesse to proceed immediately to Patton 's command to ascertain the truth of the allegations . Eisenhower also formulated a delegation to investigate the incidents from the soldiers ' points of view , including Major General John P. Lucas , two colonels from the Inspector General 's office , and a theatre medical consultant , Lieutenant Colonel Perrin H. Long , to investigate the incident and interview those involved . Long interviewed medical personnel who witnessed each incident , then filed a report entitled " <unk> of Patients in Receiving Tents of the 15th and 93rd Evacuation Hospitals , " that extensively detailed Patton 's actions at both hospitals . 
 By 18 August , Eisenhower had ordered that Patton 's Seventh Army be broken up , with a few of its units remaining garrisoned in Sicily . The majority of its combat forces would be transferred to the Fifth United States Army under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark . This had already been planned by Eisenhower , who had previously told Patton that his Seventh Army would not be part of the upcoming Allied invasion of Italy , scheduled for September . On 20 August , Patton received a cable from Eisenhower regarding the arrival of Lucas at Palermo . Eisenhower told Patton it was " highly important " that he personally meet with Lucas as soon as possible , as Lucas would be carrying an important message . Before Lucas arrived , Blesse arrived from Algiers to look into the health of the troops in Sicily . He was also ordered by Eisenhower to deliver a secret letter to Patton and investigate its allegations . In the letter , Eisenhower told Patton he had been informed of the slapping incidents . He said he would not be opening a formal investigation into the matter , but his criticism of Patton was sharp . 
 I clearly understand that firm and drastic measures are at times necessary in order to secure the desired objectives . But this does not excuse brutality , abuse of the sick , nor exhibition of uncontrollable temper in front of subordinates . ... I feel that the personal services you have rendered the United States and the Allied cause during the past weeks are of incalculable value ; but nevertheless if there is a very considerable element of truth in the allegations accompanying this letter , I must so seriously question your good judgement and your self @-@ discipline as to raise serious doubts in my mind as to your future usefulness . — Eisenhower 's letter to Patton , dated 17 August 1943 
 Eisenhower noted that no formal record of the incidents would be retained at Allied Headquarters , save in his own secret files . Still , he strongly suggested Patton apologize to all involved . On 21 August , Patton brought Bennett into his office ; he apologized and the men shook hands . On 22 August , he met with Currier as well as the medical staff who had witnessed the events in each unit and expressed regret for his " impulsive actions . " Patton related to the medical staff a story of a friend from World War I who had committed suicide after " skulking " ; he stated he sought to prevent any recurrence of such an event . On 23 August , he brought Kuhl into his office , apologized , and shook hands with him as well . After the apology , Kuhl said he thought Patton was " a great general , " and that " at the time , he didn 't know how sick I was . " Currier later said Patton 's remarks sounded like " no apology at all , an attempt to justify what he had done . " Patton wrote in his diary that he loathed making the apologies , particularly when he was told by Bennett 's brigade commander , Brigadier General John A. Crane , that Bennett had gone absent without leave ( AWOL ) and arrived at the hospital by " falsely representing his condition . " Patton wrote , " It is rather a commentary on justice when an Army commander has to soft @-@ soap a <unk> to placate the timidity of those above . " As word of the actions had spread informally among troops of the Seventh Army , Patton drove to each division under his command between 24 and 30 August and gave a 15 @-@ minute speech in which he praised their behavior and apologized for any instances where he had been too harsh on soldiers , making only vague reference to the two slapping incidents . In his final apology speech to the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division , Patton was overcome with emotion when the soldiers supportively began to chant " No , general , no , no , " to prevent him from having to apologize . 
 In a letter to General George Marshall on 24 August , Eisenhower praised Patton 's exploits as commander of the Seventh Army and his conduct of the Sicily campaign , particularly his ability to take initiative as a commander . Still , Eisenhower noted Patton continued " to exhibit some of those unfortunate traits of which you and I have always known . " He informed Marshall of the two incidents and his requirement that Patton apologize . Eisenhower stated he believed Patton would cease his behavior " because fundamentally , he is so avid for recognition as a great military commander that he will ruthlessly suppress any habit of his that will tend to jeopardize it . " When Eisenhower arrived in Sicily to award Montgomery the Legion of Merit on 29 August , Patton gave him a letter expressing his remorse about the incidents .

 Word of the slapping incidents spread informally among soldiers before eventually circulating to war correspondents . One of the nurses who witnessed the 10 August incident apparently told her boyfriend , a captain in the Seventh Army public affairs detachment . Through him a group of four journalists covering the Sicily operation heard of the incident , among them <unk> Bess of the Saturday Evening Post , Merrill Mueller of NBC News , Al Newman of Newsweek , and John Charles Daly of CBS News . The four journalists interviewed Etter and other witnesses , but decided to bring the matter to Eisenhower instead of filing the story with their editors . Bess , Mueller , and Quentin Reynolds of Collier 's Magazine flew from Sicily to Algiers , and on 19 August Bess gave a summary on the slapping incidents to Eisenhower 's chief of staff , Major General Walter Bedell Smith . The reporters asked Eisenhower directly about the incident , and Eisenhower requested that the story be suppressed because the war effort could not afford to lose Patton . Bess and other journalists initially complied . However , the news reporters then demanded Eisenhower fire Patton in exchange for them not reporting the story , a demand which Eisenhower refused . 
 The story of Kuhl 's slapping broke in the U.S. when newspaper columnist Drew Pearson revealed it on his 21 November radio program . Pearson received details of the Kuhl incident and other material on Patton from his friend Ernest Cuneo , an official with the Office of Strategic Services , who obtained the information from War Department files and correspondence . Pearson 's version not only conflated details of both slapping incidents but falsely reported that the private in question was visibly " out of his head " , telling Patton to " duck down or the shells would hit him " and that in response " Patton struck the soldier , knocking him down . " Pearson punctuated his broadcast by twice stating that Patton would never again be used in combat , despite the fact that Pearson had no factual basis for this prediction . In response , Allied Headquarters denied that Patton had received an official reprimand , but confirmed that Patton had slapped at least one soldier . 
 Patton 's wife , Beatrice Patton , spoke to the media to defend him . She appeared in True Confessions , a women 's confession magazine , where she characterized Patton as " the toughest , most hard boiled General in the U.S. Army ... but he 's quite sweet , really . " She was featured in a Washington Post article on 26 November . While she did not attempt to justify Patton 's action , she characterized him as a " tough perfectionist , " stating that he cared deeply about the men under his command and would not ask them to do something he would not do himself : 
 He had been known to weep at men 's graves — as well as tear their hides off . The deed is done and the mistake made , and I 'm sure Georgie is <unk> and has punished himself more than anyone could possibly realize . I 've known George Patton for 31 years and I 've never known him to be deliberately unfair . He 's made mistakes — and he 's paid for them . This was a big mistake , and he 's paying a big price for it . — Beatrice Patton in the Washington Post , 26 November 1943

 Demands for Patton to be relieved of duty and sent home were made in Congress and in newspapers across the country . U.S. Representative Jed Johnson of Oklahoma 's 6th district described Patton 's actions as a " despicable incident " and was " amazed and chagrined " Patton was still in command . He called for the general 's immediate dismissal on the grounds that his actions rendered him no longer useful to the war effort . Representative Charles B. <unk> of Iowa 's 9th district said on the House floor that parents of soldiers need no longer worry of their children being abused by " hard boiled officers " . He wondered whether the Army had " too much blood and guts . " Eisenhower submitted a report to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson , who presented it to Senator Robert R. Reynolds , Chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs . The report laid out Eisenhower 's response to the incident and gave details of Patton 's decades of military service . Eisenhower concluded that Patton was invaluable to the war effort and that he was confident the corrective actions taken would be adequate . Investigators Eisenhower sent to Patton 's command found the general remained overwhelmingly popular with his troops . 
 By mid @-@ December , the government had received around 1 @,@ 500 letters related to Patton , with many calling for his dismissal and others defending him or calling for his promotion . Kuhl 's father , Herman F. Kuhl , wrote to his own congressman , stating that he forgave Patton for the incident and requesting that he not be disciplined . Retired generals also weighed in on the matter . Former Army Chief of Staff Charles P. Summerall wrote to Patton that he was " indignant about the publicity given a trifling incident " , adding that " whatever [ Patton ] did " he was sure it was " justified by the provocation . Such cowards used to be shot , now they are only encouraged . " Major General Kenyon A. Joyce , another combat commander and one of Patton 's friends , attacked Pearson as a " sensation <unk> , " stating that " niceties " should be left for " softer times of peace . " In one notable dissension , Patton 's friend , former mentor and General of the Armies John J. Pershing publicly condemned his actions , an act that left Patton " deeply hurt " and caused him to never speak to Pershing again . 
 After consulting with Marshall , Stimson , and Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy , Eisenhower retained Patton in the European theater , though his Seventh Army saw no further combat . Patton remained in Sicily for the rest of the year . Marshall and Stimson not only supported Eisenhower 's decision , but defended it . In a letter to the U.S. Senate , Stimson stated that Patton must be retained because of the need for his " aggressive , winning leadership in the bitter battles which are to come before final victory . " Stimson acknowledged retaining Patton was a poor move for public relations but remained confident it was the right decision militarily . 
 = = Effect on plans for invasion of Europe = = 
 Contrary to his statements to Patton , Eisenhower never seriously considered removing the general from duty in the European Theater . Writing of the incident before the media attention , he said , " If this thing ever gets out , they 'll be howling for Patton 's scalp , and that will be the end of Georgie 's service in this war . I simply cannot let that happen . Patton is indispensable to the war effort – one of the guarantors of our victory . " Still , following the capture of Messina in August 1943 , Patton did not command a force in combat for 11 months . 
 Patton was passed over to lead the invasion in northern Europe . In September , Bradley — Patton 's junior in both rank and experience — was selected to command the First United States Army that was forming in England to prepare for Operation Overlord . According to Eisenhower , this decision had been made months before the slapping incidents became public knowledge , but Patton felt they were the reason he was denied the command . Eisenhower had already decided on Bradley because he felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty . While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a superb corps @-@ level combat commander , Bradley possessed two of the traits that a theater @-@ level strategic command required , and that Patton conspicuously lacked : a calm , reasoned demeanor , and a meticulously consistent nature . The slapping incidents had only further confirmed to Eisenhower that Patton lacked the ability to exercise discipline and self @-@ control at such a command level . Still , Eisenhower re @-@ emphasized his confidence in Patton 's skill as a ground combat commander by recommending him for promotion to four @-@ star general in a private letter to Marshall on 8 September , noting his previous combat exploits and admitting that he had a " driving power " that Bradley lacked . 
 By mid @-@ December , Eisenhower had been appointed Supreme Allied Commander in Europe , and moved to England . As media attention surrounding the incident began to subside , McCloy told Patton he would indeed be eventually returning to combat command . Patton was briefly considered to lead the Seventh Army in Operation Dragoon , but Eisenhower felt his experience would be more useful in the Normandy campaign . Eisenhower and Marshall privately agreed that Patton would command a follow @-@ on field army after Bradley 's army conducted the initial invasion of Normandy ; Bradley would then command the resulting army group . Patton was told on 1 January 1944 only that he would be relieved of command of the Seventh Army and moved to Europe . In his diary , he wrote that he would resign if he was not given command of a field army . On 26 January 1944 , formally given command of a newly arrived unit , the Third United States Army , he went to the United Kingdom to prepare the unit 's inexperienced soldiers for combat . This duty occupied Patton throughout early 1944 . 
 Exploiting Patton 's situation , Eisenhower sent him on several high @-@ profile trips throughout the Mediterranean in late 1943 . He traveled to Algiers , Tunis , Corsica , Cairo , Jerusalem , and Malta in an effort to confuse German commanders as to where the Allied forces might next attack . By the next year , the German High Command still had more respect for Patton than for any other Allied commander and considered him central to any plan to invade Europe from the north . Because of this , Patton was made a central figure in Operation Fortitude in early 1944 . The Allies fed the German intelligence organizations , through double agents , a steady stream of false intelligence that Patton had been named commander of the First United States Army Group ( FUSAG ) and was preparing for an invasion of Pas de Calais . The FUSAG command was actually an intricately constructed " phantom " army of decoys , props and radio signals based around south @-@ east England to mislead German aircraft and to make Axis leaders believe a large force was massing there . Patton was ordered to keep a low profile to deceive the Germans into thinking he was in Dover throughout early 1944 , when he was actually training the Third Army . As a result of Operation Fortitude , the German 15th Army remained at Pas de Calais to defend against the expected attack . The formation remained there even after the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 . Patton and the Third Army traveled to Europe and entered combat in July . 
 = Alconétar Bridge = 
 The Alconétar Bridge ( Spanish : Puente de Alconétar ) , also known as Puente de <unk> , was a Roman segmental arch bridge in the Extremadura region , Spain . The ancient structure , which featured flattened arches with a span @-@ to @-@ rise ratio of 4 – 5 : 1 , is one of the earliest of its kind . Due to its design , it is assumed that the bridge was erected in the early 2nd century AD by the emperors Trajan or Hadrian , possibly under the guidance of Apollodorus of Damascus , the most famous architect of the time . 
 The almost 300 m long Alconétar Bridge served as a crossing point for the Roman Via de la Plata , the most important north @-@ south connection in western Hispania , over the Tagus , the longest river of the Iberian peninsula . It presumably remained in service until the Reconquista , after which numerous early modern reconstruction attempts by Spanish engineers failed . The ruins , which were mainly to be found on the right river bank , were relocated from their original position in 1970 when the Alcántara reservoir was created . 
 = = Location and road access = = 
 The historic Alconétar Bridge , which should not be confused with the monumental Alcántara Bridge further downstream , spanned the Tagus not far from the mouth of the Almonte , in the heart of the Spanish Cáceres Province in the Extremadura region . A modern motorway and a railway , which cross the Tagus in the immediate vicinity , underline the historical importance of this crossing point between northern and southern Spain . During the building of the Alcántara Dam in 1970 , the remains of the bridge were moved from their original site to a meadow six kilometers to the north , close to the municipality of <unk> de Alconétar . By contrast , few traces are left of the neighbouring ancient bridge over the river Almonte . 
 In the classical period , the Alconétar Bridge was part of the Roman road Iter ab Emerita <unk> , that was later called Via de la Plata . This important inner Iberian connection led from the provincial capital Mérida in the south , through the river valleys of <unk> , <unk> and Tagus to the north , then on to the western part of Meseta Central , passing the major town of Salamanca . Its terminal point was Astorga in north @-@ western Spain . The Via de la Plata was one of the four main routes which were established by Augustus ( 30 BC – 14 AD ) and his successors for military control of the peninsula and for facilitating the exploitation of the rich Spanish silver and gold mines . 
 Apart from the junction over the Tagus , the remains of four other ancient bridges can be found along the road : one over the <unk> , another over the <unk> , a third close to <unk> and a fourth over the <unk> . In the hills overlooking the Alconétar Bridge , a Roman mansio with the name of <unk> ( Spanish : " Ad <unk> " ) was established , according to the then customary distance intervals . It was the fourth of a total number of sixteen between Mérida and Astorga . 
 = = History = = 
 The exact construction date of the Puente de Alconétar is unknown because of missing literary and epigraphic sources . Its segmental arches suggest that it was built in the early 2nd century AD , more specifically during the reign of the emperors Trajan ( 98 – 117 AD ) or Hadrian ( 117 – 138 AD ) , as the use of this arch form was typical of that era . Both rulers were born in the southern Spanish province of Baetica and Trajan is known to have ordered the restoration of the Iter ab Emerita <unk> when he came to power . Segmental arches were often employed by Trajan 's court architect Apollodorus of Damascus , such as in Trajan 's Forum and most notably in the greatest civil engineering achievement of its time , Trajan 's Bridge , which rested on twenty huge concrete piers and was used during the Dacian Wars for moving troops across the more than 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) wide Danube . 
 Moorish geographers make no mention of the Alconétar Bridge , even though they praise the Roman bridge of Alcántara which also leads across the Tagus . There is some evidence that a community called Alconétar , <unk> or <unk> ( Arabic : " small bridge " ) existed at least temporarily – probably an indirect reference to the high @-@ rising bridge of Alcántara . It also remains unknown why the bridge of Alconétar is called Puente de <unk> in the local vernacular , an expression which alludes to the legend of Charlemagne and his Twelve Paladins . 
 The bridge was probably in use until the time of the Reconquista , when the Tagus constituted the border between the Christian and the Moorish realm from the 11th to the 13th century , and the frequent clashes might have easily made the ancient bridge unusable . According to another theory , the water could have begun to wash away the ancient foundations at the time . 
 The Alconétar Bridge first appears in records in 1231 and , again , in 1257 , when it is explicitly referred to as being in use . It was probably repaired by the Knights Templar who had taken control of the bridge as well as the village in the meantime . The extant arches 1 and 3 , both of which are not of Roman fabric , are assumed to date back to this period . Around 1340 , however , the bridge was apparently unusable again , so that a ferry service was established to cross the river , which is also recorded at later times . On the site of the ancient way station , a fortress was erected in the Middle Ages ; its tower built of Roman spolia emerges from the Alcántara reservoir at low water . 
 Several attempts to reopen the bridge in the early modern era proved unsuccessful . In 1553 , the architect Rodrigo Gil de <unk> calculated a cost of 80 @,@ 000 <unk> for the reconstruction of the bridge without ever realising his plans . The construction project of Alonso de Covarrubias and Hernán Ruiz of 1560 never went beyond the planning stage , and neither did another project between 1569 and 1580 . 
 In the 18th century two further attempts to repair the bridge failed , in 1730 and 1760 – 70 . The latter plan of the military engineer José García Galiano included a complete reconstruction with three large @-@ span segmental arches . The planning sketch shows that already at that time the remaining arches were limited to the right bank , a finding confirmed by the drawing of Fernando Rodríguez from 1797 and engravings in Alexandre de <unk> ' Voyage <unk> de l 'Espagne a few years later . The reconstruction sketch produced by Rodriguez ( see diagram below ) shows the profile of the bridge , rising evenly and dominated by three central arches in the centre of the river . These arches are flanked by a further nine segmental arches on both sides . The symmetry of the arches suggests that , in lieu of the fortification on the right bank viewed upstream , there might have been another segmental arch in Roman times . 
 The basis for the modern scientific analysis of the bridge was laid out by the civil engineer Antonio Prieto in his 1925 survey , which details the condition of the bridge before its relocation in 1970 . Although this was a serious attempt to reconstruct the bridge as close to the original as possible , the Spanish scholar Durán points out that slight changes to the main body can never be avoided in the course of such a difficult undertaking . 
 The Alconétar Bridge has been classified as " historical heritage " since 1931 by the Spanish authorities . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Main feature of the Alconétar Bridge was the segmental shape of its arches , which were rather uncommon in ancient bridge building : in a survey of Roman bridges in Hispania , only one in ten showed the same characteristics , the vast majority being of semi @-@ circular design . According to Prieto , the bridge had sixteen arches , not including the flood openings on the right approach , with the following spans ( estimates are in square brackets ) : 
 Meters : 7 @.@ 30 – 8 @.@ 20 – 9 – 10 @.@ 15 – [ 11 – 12 – 13 – 14 – 15 – 14 ] – 13 – 12 – 11 – [ 10 ] – 9 @.@ 30 – 9 @.@ 10 
 ( Feet : 24 @.@ 0 – 26 @.@ 9 – 30 – 33 @.@ 3 – [ 36 – 39 – 43 – 46 – 49 – 46 ] – 43 – 39 – 36 – [ 33 ] – 30 @.@ 5 – 29 @.@ 9 . ) 
 Other sources however vary from eleven to fifteen arches . The total length of the rectilinear structure was 290 m ( 950 ft ) , of which 190 m ( 620 ft ) spanned the riverbed at low water . If one adds the clear span of the arches and assumes , on the basis of the preserved piers , an average pier thickness of 4 @.@ 4 m ( 14 ft ) , then the distance between both bridge ramps was 244 m ( 801 ft ) ( = 178 + 15 x 4 @.@ 4 ) , which corresponded to a river cross section of 73 % . By comparison , the corresponding discharge profiles for the Roman bridges of Córdoba , of Mérida and Salamanca were 62 % , 64 % and 80 % respectively . 
 Most of the surviving fabric was concentrated on the right bank of the Tagus where the current was less strong ; a number of pier stumps rose just above the water surface in the middle of the river , whilst on the left bank a further two piers remained standing , next to which the left abutment followed . The parts of the bridge moved to a safe place were essentially ( see images ) : the right bridge ramp with its two arch @-@ shaped flood openings , the piers 1 , 2 , and 3 with the remains of 4 and 6 , as well as the vaults 1 and 3 . The other scarce remains were submerged by the flooding of the Alcantara reservoir in 1970 . 
 The approach to the ramp is 42 m ( 138 ft ) long and 6 @.@ 55 – 6 @.@ 80 m ( 21 @.@ 5 – 22 @.@ 3 ft ) wide . The clear spans of its two segmental arches are 6 @.@ 95 m ( 22 @.@ 8 ft ) and 7 @.@ 40 m ( 24 @.@ 3 ft ) , which corresponds to a span @-@ to @-@ rise ratio of 4 @.@ 0 and 3 @.@ 3 to 1 respectively . The accurately fitting inclined contact surface of the <unk> clearly proves the Roman origin of these arches . With an extraordinary width of 1 @.@ 20 m ( 3 ft 11 in ) , the voussoirs appear oversized in relation to the span ( arch slenderness of 1 : 5 @.@ 8 and 6 @.@ 2 respectively ) . In contrast , the two surviving bridge arches no . 1 and 3 are <unk> substitutions , made of carelessly laid rubble . The date of these arches is unknown , as with all other repairs ; possibly they were built in the period of the Knights Templar . 
 Equally evidently of post @-@ classical origin is the masonry of the first two piers above the lower cornice , which projects from all piers at the same height . The superstructure of these piers could have been reconstructed for a drawbridge or a tower , which , according to an illustration in the Voyage <unk> , rested upon pier 2 . In contrast , the third pier has still preserved its original Roman character up to the top at 12 @.@ 50 m ( 41 @.@ 0 ft ) . Its carefully worked ashlar and the second cornice , which ran along all ancient piers , provide us with the most distinct impression of the original shape of the Roman bridge . 
 In particular , it is possible to reconstruct relatively precisely the rise of the Roman segmental arches on the basis of the angles of the inclined stone supports at the springing level . Thus , the third arch originally described a circular sector of 95 ° , which points to a span @-@ to @-@ rise ratio of about 4 – 5 to 1 for the other segmental arches . This value is supported by de <unk> ' engravings which depict an intact Roman segmental arch spanning the adjoining fourth bay as late as the early 19th century . Along with other early examples , such as Limyra Bridge and the Ponte San Lorenzo , the Alconétar Bridge therefore ranks among the oldest segmental arched bridges in the world . Its existence demonstrates that , in contrast to what had previously been widely believed and taught , Roman bridge builders possessed intimate knowledge of flattened arches . 
 The pier thicknesses , measuring 4 @.@ 25 m ( 13 @.@ 9 ft ) , 4 @.@ 45 m ( 14 @.@ 6 ft ) and 4 @.@ 55 m ( 14 @.@ 9 ft ) , increase slightly towards the middle of the river , while the distances between the piers increase from 7 @.@ 30 m ( 24 @.@ 0 ft ) to 10 @.@ 20 m ( 33 @.@ 5 ft ) . The fifth and ultimate pier , which carries the distinctive nickname " Bishop 's table " , takes an advanced position in the riverbed and possesses by far the largest cross @-@ section ( 8 @.@ 10 m ( 26 @.@ 6 ft ) ) . It may be of medieval origin and could have served as a base for a watchtower , replacing two ancient arches . All five piers are strengthened on the upstream face by pointed cutwaters . 
 The facing of the piers consists of local granite ashlar , set in parallel courses without the use of mortar or iron ties ( opus <unk> ) ; their interior , as those of the ramps , was filled with Roman concrete , a common method applied for Roman bridges . Outwardly , the flattened arches must have lent the bridge a rather elongated appearance , with its roadway following a horizontal or slightly convex line .

 " The Council " is the seventy @-@ fourth episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise , the twenty @-@ second episode of season three . It first aired on May 12 , 2004 , on the UPN network in the United States . The episode was the fifth of the series written by Manny Coto , and it was directed by David Livingston , his fourth of the third season . 
 Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . Season three of Enterprise features an ongoing story following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi . In this episode , Captain Jonathan Archer ( Scott Bakula ) attempts to convince the Xindi Council not to use their superweapon on Earth . Meanwhile , Subcommander T 'Pol ( Jolene Blalock ) leads an away team to a nearby sphere to attempt to retrieve a data core in order to get more information on the Sphere @-@ Builders . 
 The episode featured several returning guest stars , including Randy Oglesby , Tucker Smallwood , Josette <unk> and Sean McGowan . Additional sets were required for the scenes at the Xindi Council , while the sets for Degra 's ship had been created for an earlier episode . Although most scenes were filmed between February 12 and 23 , the scenes featuring the Sphere @-@ Builders were filmed in conjunction with the following episode on February 26 . Two reviewers praised the episode , and it was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects . There was a slight increase in ratings with the episode earning a 3 @.@ 4 / 5 % audience share , translating into approximately 3 @.@ 35 million viewers . 
 = = Plot = = 
 It is now mid @-@ February 2154 , and Enterprise is en route to the Xindi Council . Under escort by Degra 's ship , Captain Archer is briefed by him on the five member species of the Council . Other friendly Xindi ships soon join the escort . As they approach the planet , however , the flagship of Reptilian Commander Dolim intervenes . After a tense standoff , Dolim backs down . On the planet , Archer and Ensign Sato enter the Council chamber and present their evidence to the gathered representatives ; Dolim , angered at the move , walks out in protest . A Guardian appears to him later , promising Reptilian dominance if he continues their original plan . 
 Meanwhile , a shuttlepod containing Sub @-@ Commander T 'Pol , Lieutenant Reed , Ensign Mayweather and MACO Corporal Hawkins , departs to investigate a nearby sphere in order to try to collect more data on the Sphere Builders ( who are now becoming increasingly concerned with the human threat ) . The away team successfully enters an exhaust vent , and reaching the core , they are able to retrieve a memory module . The intrusion alerts an automated defense system , however , and Hawkins is disintegrated helping the others escape . 
 Doctor Phlox and Commander Tucker then create a holographic version of the Sphere Builder from " Harbinger " which Archer presents to the Council . Many admit its resemblance to the Guardian race , a people who the Xindi both revere and worship . The Council votes to delay the weapon 's launch , with even Dolim agreeing . That night , however , Dolim covertly confronts Degra in the Primate 's quarters and stabs him , declaring revenge for the destruction of the Reptilian ship and a vendetta against his family . At the next meeting , Dolim openly admits the death ( and Reptilian primacy ) and the Reptilian and <unk> members leave . They soon launch the superweapon , escorted by Dolim with his flagship . With both Enterprise and friendly Xindi vessels in pursuit , Dolim kidnaps Sato and disappears into a subspace vortex .

 Filming on " The Council " began on February 12 , 2004 , and concluded on February 23 , having taken seven days to film with shooting placed on hold for Presidents ' Day . The exception to this was the scenes featuring Sphere @-@ Builders which were shot in conjunction with the following episode , " Countdown " , on February 26 . Manny Coto wrote " The Council " , his fifth episode for Enterprise . David Livingston directed the episode , which was his fourth of the season – tying Roxann Dawson for the most episodes during season three . It was the second time that Coto and Livingston had collaborated on an episode , having previously worked together on " Harbinger " . 
 A number of temporary sets were built for the episode , including those for the Xindi Council , which were meant to be originally created in @-@ universe by the extinct avian race of Xindi . The sets for Degra 's ship continued to be used , and the Enterprise sets still featured damage following the actions in earlier episodes . " The Council " featured a larger than normal number of guest actors to represent various members of the Xindi Council . These included Tucker Smallwood as the Primate Council Member ; He had previously appeared in the role earlier in the season in " The Xindi " and " Rajiin " . Smallwood had also appeared elsewhere in the genre in Space : Above and Beyond as Commodore Ross . Sean McGowan made his fourth and final appearance of the series in " The Council " , while Randy Oglesby also made his final appearance as Degra . Josette <unk> returned as a female Sphere @-@ Builder , after first appearing in " Damage " , while Mary Mara and Ruth Williamson both made their Enterprise debuts as other Sphere @-@ Builders .

 " The Council " was first aired on May 12 , 2004 on UPN . It received a 3 @.@ 4 / 5 % share , meaning that it was seen by 3 @.@ 4 percent of all households , and 5 percent of all households watching television at the time of the broadcast . This translated to approximately 3 @.@ 35 million viewers . It was a slight increase on the ratings received by the previous episode " E ² " , which was viewed by a 3 @.@ 3 % audience share . 
 Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for TrekNation , calling it a " taut , tense action episode " with predictable plot twists that still felt " wrenching " when revealed . Although she felt that the launch of the superweapon was outweighed by the murder of Degra , she found the episode " quite engrossing " and thought " The Council " demonstrated that Enterprise was " coming into its own " . Jamahl Epsicokhan , for his website " Jammer 's Reviews " , said that the death of Degra was a shame as he was the " season 's most pivotal and interesting character " . He said that the shot of the superweapon being launched was a " terrific and fearsome shot " , and gave the episode a score of 3 @.@ 5 / 4 . The episode was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects , but lost to the team that worked on the episode " Countdown " . 
 The first home media release of " The Council " was as part of the season three DVD box set , released in the United States on September 27 , 2005 . The Blu @-@ ray release of Enterprise was announced in early 2013 , and released on January 7 , 2014 .

 = = = Jeff Killed John and record deal ( 1998 — 2005 ) = = = 
 Jeff Killed John was the forerunner band to Bullet for My Valentine and was formed in 1998 by Matthew Tuck , Michael " Padge " Paget , Nick Crandle , and Michael " Moose " Thomas while studying music at Bridgend College . They started playing Nirvana and Metallica cover songs . In 1999 , the band released their first ever EP , Better Off Alone . They released another two @-@ track EP in 2002 , You / Play with Me , which was produced by Greg Haver . The EP was financed through the <unk> scheme for new Welsh musicians and the release garnered radio airplay on BBC Radio 1 's broadcast at Newport 's T.J. ' s . Jeff Killed John 's music followed the nu metal trend set by bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit . Shortly after , the band released another two @-@ track EP titled Eye Spy . In 2003 , their second EP was released titled Don 't Walk Away . This was a promotional cd and was shipped to different record companies , as well as being given out locally in Bridgend . Unfortunately they were not successful , probably due to their playing of " nu metal " genre type music , which was becoming less popular . Thus making Jeff Killed John , one of the millions affected by the nu metal genre . Bassist Crandle left the band on the eve of entering the recording sessions for the bands self @-@ titled EP and was replaced by Jason James . The band then changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine and reworked their musical strategy ; they decided to play heavy metal songs with " harmony guitars and big angelic choruses " according to frontman Tuck . Late 2003 , they released their final EP before record labels actually began to notice their potential . This happened due to the sudden change in their strategy and sound which , the band claims came " directly out of their heads . " Their self @-@ titled EP consisted of five songs ; most of the songs became precursors of tracks from The Poison . 
 Roadrunner Records showed interest in Bullet for My Valentine and offered the band a deal . The offer was ultimately turned down , and the band signed a five @-@ album record deal with Sony BMG and a UK licensing deal with Visible Noise . According to Tuck , they chose Sony because , " We thought that a lot more doors would be open to us . " A self @-@ titled EP was released on 15 November 2004 in the UK . Produced by Colin Richardson , it featured five tracks and marked the band 's first official release . A second EP , Hand of Blood , was released on 22 August 2005 through Trustkill Records and was only available in the US ; the release contained one extra track than the self @-@ titled EP , " 4 Words ( To Choke Upon ) . " Daniel Lukes of Decibel Magazine reviewed the EP by stating , " The worst part is that the music itself isn ’ t all that bad , for the genre . " He went on to comment that the band should be " embarrassed " about the release . <unk> 's Josh Joyce complimented the band on " how technical they can get without confusing the kids . " 
 = = = The Poison ( 2005 — 07 ) = = =

Bullet for My Valentine were forced to cancel several shows , including supporting Metallica for three dates on their Sick of the Studio ' 07 tour on 29 June in Bilbao , 5 July in Vienna , and 8 July at the recently completed Wembley Stadium in London .

 = Jacob Little = 
 Jacob Little ( March 17 , 1794 – March 28 , 1865 ) was an early 19th @-@ century Wall Street investor and the first and one of the greatest speculators in the history of the stock market , known at the time as the " Great Bear of Wall Street " . Little was born in Newburyport , Massachusetts , and moved to New York City in 1817 , first clerking for Jacob Barker ; he then opened his own establishment in 1822 , and finally his own brokerage in 1834 . A market pessimist , Little made his wealth " bearing stocks " , at turns short selling various companies and at others cornering markets to extract profits from other short sellers . Through his great financial foresight Little amassed an enormous fortune , becoming one of the richest men in America and one of the leading financiers on Wall Street in the 1830s and 1840s , but his speculative activities irritated his peers and earned him few admirers . Little lost and remade his legendary fortune multiple times before losing it for good in 1857 ; although a great many owed him enormous debts , he was a generous creditor and never collected them , and at his deathbed in 1865 Little was penniless . Although well @-@ known on the stock market in his time , he was quickly forgotten after his death , and today has been relegated to relative obscurity . 
 = = Early life and background = = 
 Although much is known of Little 's investment activities in his adult life , little is known about his early years . Jacob Little was born in Newburyport , Massachusetts on March 17 , 1794 . The son of a successful local shipbuilder and of Quaker origin , Little exhibited a strong understanding of money and financial markets from an early age . In 1817 he emigrated to New York City and became a clerk in the store of Jacob Barker , a highly successful financier , merchant , and politically well @-@ connected founding member of the Democratic Party political machine Tammany Hall . Little spent five years in apprenticeship under Barker before moving out in 1822 to start his own business with $ 700 he had accrued over the length of his employment . He bought a small office in the basement of a Wall Street building , which served as his base of operations for the next twelve years , before moving out of his old office to a new one in the basement of the old exchange building in 1834 , from which he opened a brokerage — the start of his investment career . 
 = = Market operations = = 
 Little entered the stock market at a time when banking and stock @-@ brokerage was coming in of its own , progressing from a supportive activity to a profit @-@ motivated business in its own right . However , a large part of this growth came not from " solid " investors — those interested in the business ventures they funded — but from speculative " wheeler @-@ dealers " who would manipulate prices to profiteer from their holdings or , just as often , from those of others . By the eve of the American Civil War there were hundreds of such speculative brokerage firms on Wall Street ; warring cliques of bulls and bears would routinely drive prices artificially high and low , respectively , often in underhand ways that angered more legitimate stockbrokers . 
 Little was one of the earliest and most successful practitioners of market manipulation , making his fortune by leveraging both short sales and short sellers . In the former , he would sell stocks to other traders under contract to purchase it at a later date , betting that the market value would go down in the future and he could pocket the difference ( trade rules have changed , and short selling is more complicated than this today ) . In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver , corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector , up @-@ ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks . <unk> , highly ambitious , and with his eyes set on the very top from the very beginning , Little commonly spent twelve hours a day working on such maneuvers in his office and a further six during the evening engaged in currency speculation . 
 His first great coup was when in 1834 he successfully bought out the Morris Canal and Banking Company , machinations which pushed its stock price from $ 10 ( $ 237 today ) per share in December 1834 to $ 185 ( $ 4 @,@ 385 today ) a share in January 1835 , at which point Little chose to collect his debts . Although theoretically he could have asked for more ( he was , after all , in total control of the company ) , Little chose not to force the issue because he feared the resulting bankruptcies would destabilize the market potentially cause a collapse . He repeated this feat in September of the same year , cornering stocks for the construction of the Harlem Railroad . Approximately 60 @,@ 000 shares had been sold short by that time , but only 7 @,@ 000 shares had yet been issued ; needless to say , Little prospered immensely . 
 By this time Little was already one of the richest men in America , accruing millions of dollars in security holdings through short sales , a market volume that made him the " Napoleon of the Board . " He was noted for being personally retired in manner , diffident except to business , in correspondence with most of the major economic voices of the nation , and a devout member of the Episcopal Church . As a trader , he was unscrupulous and serendipitous ; in one instance he promised a group of Bostonian traders that he would not sell his holdings in the Norwich and Worcester Railroad below the price of 90 dollars a share , but promptly did so soon after when noticed its price slipping , earning him much condemnation and lasting outrage from other traders . But he was also known for his practiced judgement , the promptness of his dealings , and his great financial foresight ; Little was able to predict Andrew Jackson 's campaign against the Bank of the United States and the resultant Panic of 1837 , and was able to protect his interests during the financial debacle by short selling his own holdings , a lucrative operation that earned him his most lasting title : " The Great Bear of Wall Street . " Little himself often stated he was in the business of " bearing stock " , in the tradition of the bear market . 
 Little distinguished himself with large , early investments into the railroad construction industry , still regarded with some suspicion by financiers . As with his other activities , these paid off handily , eventually earning him a new title , that of the " Railroad King " . However , for all of his wealth Little was little loved by his peers , many of whom secretly believed him to be lacking personal integrity , a hulking , manipulative figure who built his fortune through speculation and market manipulation and crushed other traders underfoot as he did . Little " had been known to gorge and digest more stock in one day than the weight of bulk of his whole body in certificates . " Other investors followed his actions closely , terming him " too shrewd to be caught , too rich to be ruined " , and his sway and influence in the market was indeed enormous . 
 However , this aura of untouchability nearly came to an end when the <unk> was himself cornered . Little particularly favored shorting the stocks of the Erie Railroad Company , and it was here that he was trapped by the cornering of the company 's stock by a hostile syndicate of rival stockbrokers calling itself the " Happy Family " ( in much the same way as he had done to countless other traders before ) . This led to a rather dramatic showdown between Little and the financiers involved . At the time , making good on a purchase promise required a transaction at the associated clerk 's office , and on the day it was due the brokers gathered at the Erie Railroad Company clerk 's office , smug at the likelihood that they had beaten Little at his own game . What the traders did not know was that Little had purchased convertible bonds at a company sale in London a few years before ; Little entered the premises , apparently unrushed , carrying an oversize bag of what was revealed to be those very bonds , which Little had converted to stocks . To the astonishment of all , Little not only outplayed the syndicate but came out hundreds of thousands of dollars ahead ; such a maneuver was never attempted again . 
 This action ( and others like it ) was intensely unpopular with the other investors , however , and he was blackballed from entry in the New York Stock Exchange several times before regaining admittance . Following the event , a rule was made to limit the length of any option contracts to sixty days , to prevent a similar coup on the short side . After some troubles , Little was again worth $ 2 million by 1846 ( equivalent to about $ 52 @.@ 7 million today ) . However , his fortunes were again reversed that year when he attempted but failed to corner the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and was obligated to pay out for thousands of inflated shares that he had himself bid up in price , losing about a million dollars in the process — a staggering sum at the time . 
 <unk> of fortune were common in the stock market , and Little was no exception , going bankrupt three or nine times over the course of his career . After one such fall , walking with a friend along Union Square , site of some of the most prestigious and expensive housing in the city and in the world , he remarked that " I have lost money enough today to buy this whole square . Yes , and half the people in it . " It was in these instances that Little most surely showed his strength of character ; after each of his falls from fortune Little was able to rebuild his commercial empire , and even pay back his old contracts in full , leading some to remark that " Jacob Little 's suspended papers were better then [ sic ? ] the checks of most men . " 
 Nonetheless at length Little 's predictive fallacies finally failed him . The Panic of 1857 completely blindsided the investor , who at the time was " long " , possessing huge amounts of stock , much bought on the " margin " ( on loan ) . Thus when the stock prices fell Little was forced into bankruptcy by margin calls , lenders demanding recompense for the fall in the value of the stocks . This time there was no bouncing back . Little had lost all but everything he held , and did not have the confidence of others on Wall Street needed to obtain their backing . Little 's reign as Wall Street giant and one of the richest men in the country was over . 
 = = Later life and legacy = = 
 A speculator to his very core , Little never put away any of his fortune to prepare for a rainy day ; any money he made on the stock market , he immediately invested back into it . Thus when the Panic of 1857 destroyed his investment fortune , Little was left penniless . He would live out the rest of his life under the wing of his last <unk> , David Groesbeck . Little was only ever able to make small trading returns to the market in his later years , and the magnitude of his fall was often the target of mockery from his former peers . He died a broken man . Little died on March 28 , 1865 , and his funeral was held on March 31 at New York 's Grace Church . His pall @-@ bearers included Jesse Hoyt and Edward Prime ; Reverend Thomas House Taylor officiated at his funeral . 
 In his 1908 account on the early world of finance , Fifty Years in Wall Street , Henry Clews ( who knew Little personally ) penned that Little was " generous and liberal to a fault with his brother speculators who had experienced misfortune ... remarkable for his great memory , he could easily remember all the operations he made in the course of a day without making a note or a mistake , " and another stock market historian , Leonard Louis Levinson , said that he was " a nervous perfectionist who personally attended to every detail ... kind , magnanimous , honorable , and a genius in market maneuvers . " Having fallen into bankruptcy many times before , Little was a particularly sensitive debtor , and would often waive the debts held to him by others who fell on hard times ; thus it came to be that , by the time of his death , Little was owed millions of dollars by others , of which only 150 @,@ 000 was successfully collected by his friends and family , a modest sum given the size of his former wealth . 
 However , the opinion of him held by most investors of the day was not quite so rosy . A reflection on the Erie Railroad Company coup published by The New York Times in 1882 all but accused him of being a robber baron : 
 " He drove Wall @-@ street before him just as in his earlier days he would have lashed a recalcitrant ox into obedience . No method was too severe for Jacob Little . If a man stood in the way , that man got hurt . Naturally , the whole Street was dead set against him . Innumerable schemes were laid for his discomfiture , simply to end in miscarriage . Combinations were formed , to be speedily dissolved under the crack of the Little whip . " 
 Little was not the first to gain and lose his fortune in the stock market , but he was a pioneering speculator , the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information . He was the first Great Bear ; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the stock market , as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors , and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon . His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day @-@ by @-@ day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation , and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success , with little success . His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme ( and market cornering activities in general ) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter ; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad in much the same way that Little had done almost thirty years earlier , and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War . This did much to give credence to convertible bonds , then still a novelty . 
 Nonetheless for all of his wealth and innovation Little 's ignominious end ensured he was quickly forgotten , and by the time Edwin Lefèvre published his now @-@ classic Reminiscences of a Stock Operator in 1923 he was virtually unknown . To demonstrate this Lefèvre details asking nine seasoned members of the NYSE whether or not they had ever heard of Jacob Little before ; only three of them did , and none could name who he was or what he had done , only knowing of his existence from having heard his name before . Lefèvre provided for this fact by saying " what happened to Jacob was no more than what happens to thousands every year . The difference in degree does not make it more memorable . " Though it had once been that " on [ the stock ex ] change his tread was that of a king " , today Little has been relegated to obscurity , and survives only as a footnote in histories of the stock market .

The eldest of three children , he was the only son of the Reverend Isaac Mackay , a Presbyterian minister from Armadale , Sutherland , Scotland , and his Canadian wife Emily Frances , née King . Iven was educated at Grafton Superior Public School , Newington College , and the University of Sydney , where he opened the batting for the university 's cricket team , and won Blues for rugby union football and rowing . He graduated with his Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) degree in 1904 . 
 Mackay had served in the Newington College cadet unit , reaching the rank of sergeant and winning a trophy in 1899 for being the school 's best rifle shot . In 1911 , he became a lieutenant in the Cadet Corps . On 20 March 1913 , he transferred to the Militia as a lieutenant . In July he became the adjutant of the 26th Infantry Battalion , which was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Henry MacLaurin . As part of his training , he attended the School of Musketry in Randwick , New South Wales . He was promoted to captain on 1 June 1914 . Mackay joined Sydney Church of England Grammar School in 1905 , teaching various subjects and coaching the rowing and rugby teams . In 1910 he returned to the University of Sydney to teach physics . From 1913 to 1914 , he studied for a Diploma of Military Science course at the University of Sydney .

 Mackay joined the Australian Imperial Force on 27 August 1914 as adjutant of the 4th Infantry Battalion , with the rank of captain . On 4 September 1914 , he married his fiancée , Marjorie Eveline Meredith , the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel John Meredith , in a ceremony at St Philip 's Church , Sydney . The couple had met while Mackay was on holiday in Paterson , New South Wales , in 1910 . 
 In October 1914 , Mackay suffered a riding accident and was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital with a punctured lung and broken ribs . The injury forced him to miss the scheduled embarkation of his battalion . He sailed for Egypt with the 1st Reinforcements of the 13th Infantry Battalion , departing Sydney on the transport Berrima on 19 December 1914 , arriving at Alexandria on 31 January 1915 . He was then posted back to the 4th Infantry Battalion as the Transport Officer . He observed the landing at Gallipoli from the transport SS Lake Michigan , but did not go ashore with the battalion , as his job was to take care of the horses . He re @-@ joined the battalion on shore on 8 May 1915 . Heavy casualties in the early fighting had depleted the officer ranks and Mackay was promoted to major on 14 July 1915 , and given command of a company in August .

 On 6 August 1915 , Mackay was involved in the Battle of Lone Pine . When the attack began , Mackay went over the top at the head of an attack . He ignored the first Turkish trench , taking a direct line to his objective . Firing from the hip , he shot and killed several Turks in the trenches below . Mackay positioned himself at the junction of two trenches , shooting down more enemy troops . When no others appeared , he came to the belief that the trenches were in Australian hands and ran across the junction into a wide bay . The first man who attempted to follow was shot dead , as were the next two after him . The rest decided not to follow . Mackay took up a position on a fire step , a raised part of the trench floor which allows men to fire over the top . Three Turkish soldiers appeared in the trench . Mackay attempted to fire but his magazine was empty . He lunged at the Turks , grazing one and making all three run . Mackay then instructed his party to fortify the position with sandbags . As the barricade was built up , it became possible for the rest of the party to join Mackay . The post became the north eastern corner of the new Australian position at Lone Pine . It was in an exposed position and came under hand grenade attack from Turkish troops . Mackay was slightly injured in one such attack . When Lieutenant Jack Massie was sent to relieve Mackay during the night , Mackay refused to leave the post . 
 By the next day , Mackay realised that the position could not be held . He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed . When he was satisfied with the security of the new position he reported to the battalion commander , who sent him to have his wounds dressed . Mackay 's injuries were severe enough for him to be evacuated to Malta and then England , and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916 , by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt . For his actions at Lone Pine , Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross . He was overlooked for the award , although he was later mentioned in despatches .

 Mackay sailed for France on 20 March 1916 on the transport Minnewaska as part of the Advance Party of the 1st Division . On 18 April 1916 , he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the 4th Infantry Battalion . He led it at the Battle of Pozières in July , where it was involved in the capture of the town . Here , a famous incident occurred : 
 Colonels Stevens and Mackay had left their headquarters and walked forward up Dead Man 's Road ( the sunken end of the Chalk Pit road ) to its junction with the main road for the purpose of making hurried plans for the advance of their men , and instructing the company commanders . As they stood at this desolate corner ( the most actively shelled in Pozières ) , surrounded by shredded tree @-@ trunks and the dead , a panting messenger stumbled up to them with an envelope marked " Urgent and Secret " . They hurriedly tore it open . The message read : " A number of cases have lately occurred of men failing to salute the army commander when passing in his car , in spite of the fact that the car carries his flag upon the bonnet . This practice must cease . " 
 For his part in the battle , Mackay was mentioned in despatches a second time . He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his gallantry at Lone Pine , his part in the capture of Pozières , and his role in repelling a German counterattack at Mouquet Farm , near Pozières . 
 Mackay held the temporary position of commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade in January 1917 , for the first of what would be five times totalling 92 days in 1917 . He commanded the 4th Infantry Battalion in the advance to the Hindenburg Line , including the capture of the fortified town of Hermies . During the German counter @-@ attack at Lagnicourt in April 1917 his battalion held its positions , repulsing the Germans with heavy casualties . 
 Acting brigade commander again during the Second Battle of Bullecourt in May , Mackay was mentioned in despatches for the third time , and awarded a bar to his Distinguished Service Order . His citation read : 
 For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty . While acting as brigadier , when the brigade on the right was broken into by the enemy , the battalion under his orders counter @-@ attacked and assisted to drive out the enemy and restore the position . His action in repelling the counter @-@ attack was of the utmost value , and his prompt action and extreme resolution showed leadership of a high order . 
 Along with Brigadier General H. Gordon Bennett and others , Mackay received personal congratulations from Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig . He later received his medals from King George V in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace . Mackay led his battalion once more at the Battle of Broodseinde , earning a fourth mention in despatches . In March 1918 , the four machine gun companies in each division were grouped into machine gun battalions . Mackay was given command of the 1st Machine Gun Battalion , the 1st Division 's new battalion , which he led in the Battle of Hazebrouck . He was given the brevet rank of major in the 26th Infantry Battalion in the AMF back home on 3 June 1918 . 
 On 6 June 1918 , Mackay was heading on leave to London to visit his wife , who had managed to reach England after a long battle with wartime travel restrictions , when he was stopped and turned back at Boulogne by British military police . He had been appointed to command the 1st Infantry Brigade and had to return at once . He was immediately promoted to colonel and temporary brigadier general . Mackay commanded the 1st Infantry Brigade in the later stages of the fighting around Hazebrouck . In the operations east of there in June and July , his brigade was exceptionally active in the form of minor operations and patrolling that became known as the peaceful penetration . 
 In August , the 1st Division moved south to the Somme sector to participate in the Battle of Amiens and later the attack on the Hindenburg Line . Through his " careful preliminary preparations and sound tactical knowledge " , Mackay contributed to the successes of his brigade and was once more mentioned in despatches . For his service as a brigade commander , he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George ( CMG ) in the 1919 New Year Honours . He was also awarded the French Croix de guerre for his service on the Western Front .

 After the end of the war , Mackay took advantage of Brigadier General George Long 's education scheme to study physics at Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford . His first child , Jean Margaret , was born in Cambridge in 1919 . Iven and Marjorie later had two more children , a son , Iven John , born in Sydney in 1920 , and another daughter , Alison , born in Sydney in 1930 . 
 They returned to Australia aboard the transport Mantua , which reached Sydney on 19 February 1920 . With the war over , the AIF was demobilised , and Mackay 's appointment to the AIF was terminated on 4 April 1920 . Mackay returned to lecturing in physics at the University of Sydney . Between 1922 and 1932 , he was student adviser . From 1925 he was also faculty secretary . From 1932 to 1940 , Mackay also worked evenings as a Commonwealth Film Appeals Censor . 
 In 1933 , he was appointed headmaster of Cranbrook School , Sydney . The school 's constitution was changed to allow Mackay , a Presbyterian , to hold the post . As a result of a case of mistaken identity following the death of Major General James Mackay in 1935 , Mackay got to read his own obituary in The Times , entitled " Athlete , Soldier and Headmaster " . He normally avoided publicity , but this incident brought him to national attention . 
 Mackay remained active in the Militia throughout the inter @-@ war period . He held the rank of honorary brigadier general from 21 January 1920 to late June 1937 , when he was promoted to that rank substantively . He commanded the 9th Infantry Brigade from 1 July 1920 to 30 April 1921 , the 8th Infantry Brigade from 1 May 1921 to 30 April 1926 and the 5th Infantry Brigade from 1 May 1930 to 31 December 1932 . On 24 March 1937 , he took command of the 2nd Division . He was promoted to major general on 1 July 1937 . Mackay was one of only four Militia officers to be substantively promoted to that rank between 1929 and 1939 . 
 His term of office at Cranbrook ended acrimoniously after Justice Kenneth Street and others blamed Mackay for the school 's slow recovery from the Great Depression , and the school council voted to remove him on 25 October 1939 . Mackay was given twelve months ' notice . When , in December 1939 , Mackay 's daughter Jean married Lieutenant W. H. Travers , the grandson of Major General William Holmes , the reception was held at Cranbrook .

 At the outbreak of war in 1939 , Mackay was ranked seventh on the army 's seniority list . Following formation of a second infantry division for the Second Australian Imperial Force in 1940 , Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey was elevated to command of the newly created I Corps . Mackay was selected to command the 7th Division on the advice of General Sir Brudenell White but Cabinet , after consulting with Blamey , switched this appointment to the 6th Division . Mackay assumed command on 4 April 1940 , receiving the serial number <unk> , and sailed from Melbourne for the Middle East on the ocean liner RMS Strathaird on 15 April . 
 The troops nicknamed him " Mr Chips " , after the title character of the best selling 1934 novel Goodbye , Mr. Chips and the subsequent 1939 film , a reference to his peacetime profession , but also to the impression he gave of being cool , reserved and strict . Some of his staff had reservations about him . Colonel Alan Vasey , his Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General , asserted that Mackay lacked the ruthlessness to remove Militia officers who were not performing well . Vasey fumed about " that bloody schoolteacher who wants to dot every ' i ' and cross every ' t ' " . Many regular officers were embittered by years of slow promotion followed by Prime Minister Robert Menzies ordering that commands in the 6th Division be given to Militia officers . Colonel Frank Berryman considered this " a damn insult to the professional soldier , calculated to split the Army down the centre . We were to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water . We , the only people who really knew the job , were to assist these Militia fellows " . Berryman , who worked closely with Mackay as his chief of staff , held him in high regard . " For moral and physical courage " , said Berryman , " few equalled him — none ever surpassed him . He was an educated and most knowledgeable soldier ... and extremely patient " . His Commander , Royal Australian Artillery , a reservist , Brigadier Edmund Herring , considered Mackay " a most competent and able commander in North Africa and Greece , but a bit old ... Modest , dignified , shy and scholarly ... In action he never knew the meaning of fear ... " 
 = = = Libya = = = 
 His appointment to command the 6th Division meant that Mackay led its — and the Australian Army 's — first battles of the war . Doubts about Mackay 's ability soon disappeared with the commitment of the division to Operation Compass . During the Battle of Bardia , in Libya in January 1941 , the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36 @,@ 000 Italian prisoners . For this success , Mackay was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( KBE ) . In a war of rapid movement over long distances , Mackay demonstrated careful planning and recognised the need to reinforce success . He also impressed others with the way he cared for soldiers ' lives . " Not only do I want Tobruk quickly " , he told his brigadiers before the battle , " but I also want it cheaply " . The victory at Bardia was followed by successes at Tobruk , Derna and Benghazi . 
 = = = Greece = = = 
 The 6th Division 's next campaign was the failed Battle of Greece , a disaster for the British Commonwealth forces sent there . While in Greece , Mackay led a hastily assembled Australian @-@ British @-@ New Zealand @-@ Greek formation known as Mackay Force , defending the <unk> Pass at the Battle of Vevi . The Allies were forced to retreat in a fierce assault by the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade . Mackay was the only Australian general to face the Waffen @-@ SS in battle . 
 As in Libya , Mackay shared the hardships of living in the field with his men , and impressed them by his coolness during air raids . They watched him sit in the open during attacks ; on one such occasion on 19 April 1941 , Mackay waited out a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ hour raid when his car was hit and his driver wounded . One staff officer " noticed Mackay moving in front of his tent quite unconcerned about the movement of enemy planes . He neither looked at the planes nor at the men dashing about , but they saw him , and those moving towards shelter stopped , and many of those who had gained shelter returned to their duties . Personal example is the only paying proposition in such circumstances " . For his actions in Greece , he was mentioned in despatches a sixth time , and awarded the Greek War Cross ( First Class ) . 
 Casualties in Greece included Mackay 's son @-@ in @-@ law , Captain W. H. Travers , who was captured in the Battle of Crete . Mackay resolved to reform the battalions that had been destroyed in Greece , and to rebuild his shattered division from the remnants that had been evacuated to Alexandria . He developed a training program in Syria in which he attempted to apply the lessons of the campaign in Greece . 
 = = = Defence of Australia = = = 
 One lesson of Greece was that modern war was a young man 's trade . Brigadier Sydney Rowell recommended to Blamey that all generals over the age of 50 be retired . In July 1941 , Ernest Turnbull , representing the motion picture industry , approached Menzies and several members of his Cabinet about the possibility of Mackay becoming Chief Commonwealth Film Censor . Menzies had a different post in mind . On 24 July 1941 the War Cabinet decided to appoint a General Officer Commanding Home Forces . In a cable to Blamey , Menzies stipulated that the War Cabinet wanted a high @-@ ranking officer like Mackay with active service in the current war . Blamey replied that he considered " Mackay most suitable for the appointment " . 
 On 14 August 1941 , Mackay handed over command of the 6th Division to Herring . Mackay departed Cairo for Australia by flying boat on 22 August . En route , he stopped in Singapore to confer with Bennett , now the commander of the 8th Division , which was based there , and had dinner at the Raffles Hotel with his son , Lieutenant Iven Mackay , an officer with the 8th Division 's 2 / 18th Infantry Battalion . 
 Mackay assumed command of Home Forces on 1 September 1941 , with the rank of lieutenant general . His task was to prepare the Militia to repel a Japanese invasion . Official historian Dudley McCarthy noted that : 
 If Mackay had been in any way deceived by the grandiloquence of his new title his illusions were soon dissipated when he assumed command on 1 September . Initially there was reluctance to grant him the substantive promotion he had been promised . He found that his authority did not extend over the forward areas of New Guinea and the Northern Territory ; nor was he to be responsible for " the defence of Australia " as such , as this responsibility remained with General Sturdee , the Chief of the General Staff . In short his command was far more circumscribed than he might have expected , with the added disadvantage of calling for a political finesse to the possession of which he laid few claims . He was a gallant and successful soldier , with a long record of distinguished service to his country , and a man of instinctive and unassuming courtesy . But neither his qualities of character and temperament nor the academic seclusion of his life between the wars fitted him well for the role of a senior military adviser to a Cabinet inexperienced in military affairs . 
 With the Fall of Singapore in February 1942 , Mackay 's son Iven became a prisoner of war of the Japanese . A Japanese invasion of Australia now became a real possibility , so Mackay submitted a contingency plan in which he outlined a defence strategy whereby the army would concentrate on the defence of the most vital areas of eastern and southern Australia . This later gave rise to the controversial but mythical " Brisbane Line " . 
 Regular officers took the opportunity to give Mackay petty snubs . Army Headquarters continually addressed him as " major general " , although his promotion to lieutenant general had been gazetted , and his pay was only £ 1 @,@ 564 compared with Sturdee 's £ 2 @,@ 269 . His AIF serial number was taken away from him and he was sent a new recruit 's papers to fill in . The Military Board even attempted to bring him before a medical board to decide his fitness for further service . Only the intervention of the Minister for the Army , Frank Forde , averted this . During a sweeping reorganisation of the army by Blamey , Mackay became commander of the Second Army on 6 April 1942 . 
 = = = New Guinea = = = 
 When Blamey relieved Rowell of command of I Corps in New Guinea , he nominated Herring as successor . Blamey proposed Mackay as a second choice but preferred Herring as he was much younger , and this was important in the taxing New Guinea climate . When Blamey relinquished command of New Guinea Force on 30 January 1943 , he handed over temporary command to Mackay to enable Herring to go on leave . The period was a quiet one , with no major operations being carried out , and Mackay handed back to Herring and returned to command of the Second Army at Parramatta , New South Wales , in May 1943 . 
 On 28 August 1943 , Mackay once again assumed command of New Guinea Force . This time , important operations were being undertaken in the Battle of Finschhafen and Mackay 's period of command was marred by disagreements with General Douglas MacArthur 's staff over the reinforcement of Finschhafen . Junior commanders felt that Mackay should have been more forceful , and should have enlisted the help of his superior , Blamey , at an earlier stage . Blamey agreed with them , feeling that his old colleague was slowing down , and no longer possessed the vigour required for the campaign in New Guinea . Mackay left New Guinea in November 1943 , handing over command of New Guinea Force to Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead , and on 20 January 1944 Mackay relinquished command of Second Army and New Guinea Force . 
 = = = India = = = 
 In November 1943 , it was announced that Prime Minister John Curtin , with Blamey 's approval , had appointed Mackay as High Commissioner to India . Sir Iven and Lady Mackay sailed from Perth , on SS Tanda on 14 February 1944 . Their arrival in Delhi marked the beginning of an Australian diplomatic presence in India . When Lieutenant Iven Mackay was liberated , the Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia Command , Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten had him brought to Delhi to be reunited with his family . With the war 's end , Mackay retired from the army on 27 February 1946 , and the post of High Commissioner gradually became a civilian one . India was not yet independent , but was about to become so , and Mackay met with future leaders Jawaharlal Nehru , Indira Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah . Mackay and the Minister for External Affairs , Dr H. V. Evatt , supported Indian independence , while expressing the hope that India would remain in the British Commonwealth . Mackay also promoted trade between India and Australia , and fostered a plan for Indian students and technicians to study and train in Australia . His term as high commissioner ended in May 1948 . 
 = = Post war = = 
 Mackay was approached to consider nomination as a Liberal Party of Australia candidate for the Australian Senate , but declined . Instead , he accepted a directorship of Australian Cotton Textile Industries . From 1950 to 1952 , he chaired the New South Wales recruiting committee which was set up by the Federal government to increase enlistment in the armed forces . The University of Sydney appointed Mackay an honorary Esquire Bedell in 1950 and awarded him an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws in 1952 . When Blamey died in 1951 , Mackay rushed to Melbourne to be one of his pallbearers . Mackay visited Greece in 1952 for the unveiling of a memorial to British Commonwealth servicemen who died in the 1941 campaign . In 1961 , he returned for the dedication of the Commonwealth War Cemetery at <unk> . This time he also revisited the Gallipoli battlefields , sailing to the Dardanelles on HMY Britannia as a guest of Field Marshal Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester . Mackay climbed from the beach at ANZAC Cove up to Lone Pine once more . When it became known that he was visiting the United States in 1961 , the US Army took him to see Fort Sill . 
 Mackay died at his home in East Lindfield , New South Wales , on 30 September 1966 and was cremated after a service at St Stephen 's , Sydney . He was survived by his wife , his son and his two daughters . Veterans lined the streets and he had ten generals for his pallbearers : Herring , Woodward , Stevens , Pulver , Stevenson , Macarthur @-@ Onslow , Dougherty , Harrison , Cullen and <unk> . Mackay 's papers and portraits are held in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra . 
 = Celtic Park = 
 Celtic Park is a football stadium in the Parkhead area of Glasgow , and is the home ground of Celtic Football Club . Celtic Park , an all @-@ seater stadium with a capacity of 60 @,@ 411 , is the largest football stadium in Scotland and the sixth @-@ largest stadium in the United Kingdom . It is also commonly known by Celtic fans as either Parkhead or Paradise . 
 Celtic was formed in November 1887 and the first Celtic Park was opened in the Parkhead area in 1888 . The club moved to a different site in 1892 , however , when the rental charge was greatly increased . The new site was developed into an oval shaped stadium , with vast terracing sections . The record attendance of 83 @,@ 500 was set by an Old Firm derby on 1 January 1938 . The terraces were covered and floodlights were installed between 1957 and 1971 . The Taylor Report mandated that all major clubs should have an all @-@ seated stadium by August 1994 . Celtic was in a bad financial position in the early 1990s and no major work was carried out until Fergus McCann took control of the club in March 1994 . He carried out a plan to demolish the old terraces and develop a new stadium in a phased rebuild , which was completed in August 1998 . 
 Celtic Park has often been used as a venue for Scotland internationals and Cup Finals , particularly when Hampden Park has been unavailable . Before the First World War , Celtic Park hosted various other sporting events , including composite rules shinty @-@ hurling , track and field and the 1897 Track Cycling World Championships . Open @-@ air Mass celebrations and First World War recruitment drives were also held there . More recently , Celtic Park hosted the opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games and has also been used for concerts , including performances by The Who and U2 .

 Celtic F.C. was formed in November 1887 . The original Celtic Park was built at the north east junction of Springfield Road and London Road in Parkhead by a volunteer workforce within six months of formation . Its opening game was a match between Hibernian and Cowlairs . Celtic played its first match on 28 May 1888 at Celtic Park , against Rangers , which Celtic won 5 – 2 . It hosted a British Home Championship match between Scotland and Ireland on 28 March 1891 . Celtic was forced to leave this site in 1892 , however , when the landlord increased the annual rent from £ 50 to £ 450 . 
 The new stadium was built in a disused brickyard at <unk> Street , 200 yards from the old site . The first turf , which had been transported from County Donegal , was laid by Irish patriot Michael Davitt and planted with shamrocks . He recited a verse that said the turf would " take root and flourish " , but it was stolen soon afterwards . A journalist said the move was like " leaving the graveyard to enter paradise " , which led to the ground being nicknamed " Paradise " . The new Celtic Park was opened on 20 August 1892 with a match against Renton . A journalist writing in the Athletic News described Celtic Park as the best ground in Britain at the time , a title for which it may only have been challenged by Goodison Park , the home of Everton . Celtic Park was immediately successful , attracting record gate receipts and an attendance of 45 @,@ 107 for the Scotland v England game in the 1894 British Home Championship . Celtic F.C. purchased the site for £ 100 @,@ 000 in 1897 . 
 The new stadium initially consisted of terracing with a capacity of approximately 40 @,@ 000 . It was an elongated oval shape , similar to Hampden Park . A running track and concrete cycling track were also constructed around the periphery of the pitch . On the northern side of the pitch there was a pavilion and a seated stand . In 1898 , club director James Grant financed the construction of a grandstand and press gallery , built on stilts , on the south side of the pitch . The patrons watched through sliding windows from padded seats , but they had to climb four flights of stairs to reach their position and the windows frequently steamed up . 
 The Grant Stand was burned down in 1927 and replaced by a single @-@ tier Main Stand , designed by Duncan and Kerr . This stand , which cost £ 35 @,@ 000 and provided 4 @,@ 800 seats , was smaller and less ornate than the Main Stand at Ibrox . The Celtic Park main stand had a similar feature to Ibrox , however , in the pedimented roof gable over the press box . Although it was only the third biggest ground in Glasgow , Celtic Park had a greater capacity than any club stadium in England . The record attendance for a Celtic match at Celtic Park was set by an Old Firm derby against Rangers on New Year 's Day 1938 . Some sources give the attendance for this game as 92 @,@ 000 , but contemporary sources suggest that the attendance was approximately 83 @,@ 500 . 
 = = = 1957 – 1994 = = = 
 Significant improvements were carried out between 1957 and 1971 , partly due to the great success Celtic achieved under the management of Jock Stein . A roof was built over the western " Celtic End " terrace in 1957 , while floodlights were installed in 1959 . They were first used on 12 October , in a friendly match against Wolves . The northern terrace , which became known as the " Jungle " , was concreted in 1966 and a new roof was erected . A roof was built over the eastern " Rangers End " terrace in 1967 , using the same design as the Rangers End at Hampden Park . All of this work meant that Celtic had more covered terracing than any other stadium in Britain , except Wembley . There were 4 @,@ 800 seats , all in the Main Stand , in an overall capacity of 80 @,@ 000 . A further 3 @,@ 900 seats were installed in the Main Stand paddock area in 1971 . A new roof was erected over the Main Stand in 1971 , which cost £ 250 @,@ 000 . It was supported by a " goalpost " framework , with the top girder measuring 97 @.@ 5 metres long . The design was flawed , however , as the roof provided little shelter to the paddock seats , and retractable columns had to be installed to provide stability in case of high winds or heavy snow . Celtic later sued the designers and won damages . 
 The regulations in the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 reduced the capacity of Celtic Park to 56 @,@ 500 , but the club then increased the terracing to raise capacity to 67 @,@ 000 . In 1986 , £ 1 million was spent on replacing the western terrace roof with a replica of the eastern terrace , which had been designed nearly twenty years earlier . The original red brick facade to the Main Stand was replaced during the club 's centenary year in 1988 , while lounges and offices were installed . Although the Main Stand had been modernised , terracing was still predominant at Celtic Park . This stood in contrast to most other major stadia in Britain , particularly Ibrox , where seating capacities had been increased . This left Celtic badly placed when the Taylor Report mandated that all major clubs had to have an all @-@ seater stadium . 
 Celtic was heavily in debt and had been significantly outgrown by Rangers commercially in the early 1990s . The Celtic board initially prevaricated in response to the Taylor Report , partly due to divisions in the board . Celtic director Brian Dempsey proposed a development on land he controlled at <unk> , but he was opposed by fellow directors , Michael Kelly and Chris White , who had Dempsey removed from the board . Despite these divisions , a proposal to build a new 52 @,@ 000 seat stadium on industrial waste ground at Cambuslang was unveiled in April 1992 . The £ 100 million scheme was meant to include wider commercial developments that would fund the completed stadium , which would have only provided 32 @,@ 000 seats in a first phase of construction . There was scepticism about the plan , however , as it was unclear how Celtic or their partner in the project , <unk> , would raise the necessary finance . The proposed site would have had to be decontaminated , and contradictory statements about the ownership structure of the development were issued . Outline planning permission was granted in May 1993 . 
 A deadline of August 1994 had been set to convert all major grounds to be fully seated . Even with planning permission granted , the first phase of the Cambuslang scheme would not be ready until 1995 . As a stop @-@ gap measure , Celtic installed 5 @,@ 033 seats in the Jungle at the end of the 1992 – 93 season , at a cost of £ 350 @,@ 000 . The board hoped Celtic would be given a special dispensation from the rules . Installing seats in the Jungle itself caused an emotional reaction . Due to redevelopment work at Hampden , the 1993 Scottish Cup Final between Rangers and Aberdeen was to be played at Celtic Park . This meant that in the last competitive game in front of the Jungle , it would be occupied by Rangers fans . To give the Celtic supporters last use , a friendly match between veteran Celtic and Manchester United players was arranged . 
 During the 1993 – 94 season , the board continued to talk optimistically about their plans . They claimed in February to have £ 20 million of funding in place from <unk> , a Swiss financial institution . The claim was denied by <unk> , who denied that they had even had any contact with the club . Celtic then came under severe pressure from the Bank of Scotland , who demanded a £ 1 million reduction in the club 's overdraft , placing the club under threat of bankruptcy . With minutes to spare before a deadline set by the Bank , the board capitulated and sold control to Scots @-@ Canadian businessman Fergus McCann .

 McCann quickly discarded the Cambuslang scheme and instead started plans to bring Celtic Park into compliance with the Taylor Report . The capacity would have been only 34 @,@ 000 if seats had been installed in the remaining terraces , which was greater than Celtic 's average attendance in the previous six seasons . McCann , who believed the club could fill a much larger stadium , decided instead to effectively build a new stadium . In the summer of 1994 , the Jungle , East Terracing and West Terracing were demolished , with only the structure of the Main Stand left intact . The relatively new Jungle seats were used to refresh the seating in the Main Stand . Celtic played their home games at Hampden Park during the 1994 – 95 season , which cost the club £ 500 @,@ 000 in rent . Celtic raised over £ 26 million to fund the work from two share issues : £ 12 @.@ 3 million in a rights issue ( £ 9 @.@ 4 million invested by McCann ) and £ 14 million in a public offering . 10 @,@ 000 ordinary fans bought into the public offering , while season ticket sales rose from 7 @,@ 000 to 26 @,@ 000 . 
 The detailed plans were finalised in December 1994 . The club intended to build a 60 @,@ 000 seat stadium , to be completed in three phases . The first phase was the new North Stand , which was designed by Percy Johnson @-@ Marshall Associates , engineered by Hutter Jennings Titchmarsh , and built by Miller Construction . Celtic Park reopened with a friendly against Newcastle on 5 August 1995 , with the new 26 @,@ 970 @-@ capacity North Stand and the existing 7 @,@ 850 @-@ capacity Main ( South ) Stand in place . This was augmented by a temporary stand on the site of the former West Terracing , which held 2 @,@ 800 seats . Phase two of the redevelopment was completed in August 1996 , with the opening of the 13 @,@ 006 @-@ capacity East Stand . Phase 3a was completed in February 1998 with the opening of the South West Corner . This was followed by Phase 3b , the Jock Stein Stand on the former West Terracing site , which was opened in August 1998 with a match against Liverpool . This third phase added another 13 @,@ 006 seats , bringing the total capacity of the new Celtic Park to 60 @,@ 411 . Phases 2 and 3 were built by Barr Construction . The whole redevelopment , which made Celtic Park the biggest club stadium in Britain , cost £ 40 million . In the 1998 – 99 season the average attendance was 59 @,@ 224 and season ticket sales exceeded 53 @,@ 000 , the highest number in Britain at the time .

 Celtic Park is an all @-@ seated bowl stadium , although the ground is split into four geographic sections , officially known as the North , Jock Stein ( West ) , Lisbon Lions ( East ) and Main ( South ) Stands . The North , East and West stands form a continuous two tier loop . The two end stands each have a capacity of 13 @,@ 000 , while the North Stand holds 27 @,@ 000 . The Main Stand holds just under 8 @,@ 000 , giving a total capacity of 60 @,@ 411 . Celtic Park is now a rectangular shape , creating an enclosed and intimidating atmosphere for big games . It received 60 % of the votes when BBC Radio Five Live conducted a poll in 2002 to find the favourite sports venue in the United Kingdom . 
 The North Stand is squeezed into a tight space between the pitch and the Eastern Necropolis ( cemetery ) . Part of the upper tier is cantilevered over the graveyard . To save at least £ 1 million of additional steelwork , fourteen internal pillars were installed to support the roof . Some local residents objected to the North Stand because of the shadow cast over the cemetery , which Celtic believed was necessary to complete the overall project . The proposals were passed because the local officials felt that Celtic had come up with the best solution possible to the problem . Celtic paid £ 10 @,@ 000 to compensate residents who had been promised open space " from the centre of the earth to the sky " . The structure also had to take account of the need to maintain access into the North Stand along <unk> Street , which has been closed to the public since the redevelopment . Between the two tiers there are 18 executive boxes and a restaurant . There are 1600 seats in the lower section of the North Stand which have a heated element , operated by a foot switch . 
 The Main ( South ) Stand is now the oldest part of the stadium , having first been built in 1929 , although a new roof was installed in 1971 and the facade was rebuilt in 1988 . Translucent sheets were added to the Main Stand roof in 1998 , to allow more sunlight to reach the pitch . Suspended from the roof girder of the Main Stand is a glass @-@ fronted box , which used to house the press box , but was converted into two executive boxes in 1988 . Alongside the main horizontal truss are two retractable columns . These can swing down to a fixing point on the rear wall of the former paddock , which provides additional stability in case of high winds or heavy snow . 
 The East Stand opened in 1996 ; it was renamed in 2000 after the Lisbon Lions , the Celtic team that won the 1967 European Cup Final . The renaming ceremony was a few days after a Scottish Cup tie had to be postponed after strong winds had damaged guttering in the stand . Away team fans are housed in the Lisbon Lions Stand , in the south east corner of the ground . Some of the away section has its view restricted by one of the supporting pillars of the Main Stand . Celtic offer a discounted price on these seats . 
 Writing in 1996 , Simon Inglis noted that the approaches to the Main Stand were an area of urban deprivation " reminiscent of Belfast during the Troubles " . Redevelopment work was carried out in the area ahead of the 2014 Commonwealth Games , in a scheme dubbed the ' Celtic Triangle ' . Since 2005 , statues of Brother Walfrid , Jimmy Johnstone and Jock Stein have been erected outside the Main Stand . 
 Celtic have considered the possibility of increasing the capacity of Celtic Park by redeveloping the Main Stand . A completed two @-@ tier bowl stadium would give Celtic Park a capacity of nearly 75 @,@ 000 . Celtic chief executive Peter <unk> stated in April 2007 that another 8 @,@ 000 could be added to the capacity , but the work was not considered cost @-@ effective . 
 In September 2011 , Celtic started a feasibility study into creating a safe standing section in Celtic Park . Although there is a law in England preventing top @-@ flight clubs from having standing sections , no such law exists in Scotland . In June 2015 , Celtic received safety approval for a proposal to install rail seating . A section of 2 @,@ 975 rail seats was installed in the Lisbon Lions Stand during the 2016 close season .

 Celtic Park has been a home venue for the Scotland national football team over 20 times , the most of any ground apart from the national stadium , Hampden Park . Scotland secured qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup with a 2 – 0 win against Latvia at Celtic Park . The ground most recently hosted a Scotland game in November 2014 , when Hampden was unavailable because it had been reconfigured for use as an athletics stadium during the 2014 Commonwealth Games . Celtic Park also hosted both national cup finals during the 2013 – 14 season for this reason . While Hampden Park was being redeveloped during the 1990s , Celtic Park hosted the 1993 and 1998 Scottish Cup Finals and the 1993 , 1996 and 1998 Scottish League Cup Finals . 
 Before the First World War , Celtic Park was a multi @-@ event venue . It hosted the first ever composite rules shinty @-@ hurling match in Scotland , in 1897 . Track and field meetings were held every summer , while the only World Cycling Championship to be staged in Scotland was held at Celtic Park in 1897 . An experimental floodlit football game was played on Christmas Day 1893 . This was unsuccessful due to the ball repeatedly striking the lamps , which were hung over the pitch by wiring . Rugby league football was first played in Scotland at Celtic Park , when it hosted a game between a Northern Rugby Football Union representative side and the touring Australian team in 1909 . Open @-@ air Masses and a parade for the Coronation of King George V were staged . Celtic Park , along with many other football stadiums , hosted recruitment drives during the First World War . During one such event at Celtic Park , a demonstration of trench warfare was carried out . The first <unk> speedway race meeting in Scotland was held at Celtic Park on 28 April 1928 . It staged 12 meetings in all before closing in July 1928 . 
 Celtic Park has been used for concerts by The Who ( 1976 ) , Bryan Adams ( 1992 ) , Prince ( 1992 ) and U2 ( 1993 ) . Wet Wet Wet played there in September 1997 , but their performance had to be postponed by a day to avoid clashing with the funeral of Diana , Princess of Wales . Paul McCartney planned a Celtic Park date in his 2003 Back in the World tour , but it was cancelled . American evangelical Christian missionary Billy Graham held an outdoor event at the ground in 1991 , his first visit to Scotland since 1955 . One of the supporting speakers was Aberdeen player Brian Irvine , who had scored the winning penalty kick against Celtic in the 1990 Scottish Cup Final . 
 Celtic Park was used for the opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games . With Hampden also being used for the Games , Celtic played two European ties at Murrayfield Stadium instead . Owing to further redevelopment work on Celtic Park in 2015 , Celtic scheduled three pre @-@ season games for St Mirren Park . 
 = = Transport = = 
 The main railway stations in Glasgow , Central and Queen Street , are approximately 30 minutes walking distance from Celtic Park . Local trains from Glasgow Central on the Argyle Line serve <unk> railway station , which is about 10 minutes walking distance from the ground . Fans travelling to Celtic Park also use <unk> and Bridgeton stations , which are both approximately one mile away . Between 1897 and 1964 , Celtic Park was served by the eponymous Parkhead Stadium railway station . The stadium is served by First Glasgow bus route numbers 43 , 61 and 62 . Celtic Park sits adjacent to the <unk> ( London Road ) , near to the M74 and M8 motorways . Visitors to the ground travelling by car can park in the surrounding streets . The new Glasgow East End Regeneration Route , which will link the two motorways , will run close by Celtic Park .

 The šajkača ( Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> ] ) is the Serbian national hat or cap . Traditionally worn by men in the Serbian countryside , it is named after Serb river troops known as <unk> , who protected the Austrian Empire against the Ottoman Turks in the 18th century . A popular nationalist symbol in Serbia since the beginning of the early 20th century , it is typically black or grey in colour and is usually made of soft , homemade cloth . It became widely worn by Serb men during the First Serbian Uprising and was a key component in the uniform of the Serbian military from the beginning of the 19th century until the end of the 20th century . Today , it is mostly worn by elderly men in rural communities . 
 = = History = = 
 The šajkača is a traditional hat worn by men in the Serbian countryside . It is the national hat of Serbia and is believed to have originated in the Serbian region of Banat during the 18th century , when <unk> ( Serb river troops in the service of the Austrian Empire ) guarded the Danube and Sava rivers against the Ottoman Empire and wore caps in the shape of an overturned <unk> ( Serbian : <unk> , <unk> ) boat . It became widely worn amongst Serbs at the time of the First Serbian Uprising , when the men of Serbian revolutionary Karađorđe Petrović began discarding their Turkish fezzes in favour of the cap . 
 The typical cap of peasants from the Šumadija region of Serbia , the šajkača eventually acquired a dual purpose : during times of peace it was worn in the countryside , and in wartime it became part of the standard Serbian military uniform . During World War I , the cap was regularly worn by the soldiers of the Kingdom of Serbia . Serbia was eventually overrun by a combined Austro @-@ Hungarian , German and Bulgarian invasion in 1915 , and in 1916 the wearing of the šajkača , alongside other Serbian folk attire , was outlawed by Bulgarian authorities in the wake of the Bulgarian occupation of southern Serbia . After the war , the wearing of the hat in Bosnia was made obligatory by Serbian authorities in place of the Turkish fez . During World War II , the šajkača was the standard hat worn by Serbian Chetnik irregulars in the Axis @-@ occupied Kingdom of Yugoslavia . After the war , it was replaced by the <unk> cap in the armed forces of communist Yugoslavia . 
 The šajkača was worn by Serb soldiers during the breakup of Yugoslavia . Bosnian Serb reservists and paramilitaries wore the cap during the 1992 – 95 Bosnian War , and it was later adopted by Bosnian Serb forces to be the official headgear of the Army of Republika Srpska ( Serbian : Vojska Republike Srpske , VRS ) . Following the 1991 Battle of Vukovar , fought during the Croatian War of Independence , Croatian Serb authorities erected gravestones to the Serb soldiers who were killed fighting for the city . These were originally topped with sculptural evocations of the šajkača cap . After Vukovar 's reintegration into Croatia the gravestones were repeatedly vandalized , leading the Serb community in the town to replace them with more neutral gravestones without any overt military connotations . The 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia saw McDonald 's chains in Serbia promote their products by distributing posters and lapels which depicted the šajkača standing atop the golden arches of the McDonald 's logo in an attempt to bolster Serbian national pride . 
 The šajkača has been a popular nationalist symbol in Serbia since the beginning of the 20th century . It is commonly worn by elderly men in the Serbian countryside , whereas Serbian youth wear traditional costumes only for folklore concerts . 
 = = Design = = 
 Designed with a V @-@ shaped top in the form of an overturned <unk> , the šajkača is narrow and typically black or grey in colour . It is usually made of soft , homemade cloth and is worn without any symbols during peacetime . During times of war , cockades featuring the Serbian double @-@ headed eagle and the motto Only Unity Saves the Serbs are often seen on the cap . The šajkača worn by Serbian soldiers during World War I had a non @-@ reflecting peak and was topped with a royal monogram .

 Katamari Damacy ( <unk> , Katamari Damashii , lit . " clump soul " ) is a third @-@ person puzzle @-@ action video game developed and published by Namco for the PlayStation 2 . It was first released in Japan and then later in North America . The game resulted from a school project from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory , and was developed for less than $ 1 million . In designing Katamari Damacy , the development team aimed to maintain three key points : novelty , ease of understanding , and enjoyment . 
 The game 's plot concerns a diminutive prince on a mission to rebuild the stars , constellations , and Moon , which were accidentally destroyed by his father , the King of All Cosmos . This is achieved by rolling a magical , highly adhesive ball called a katamari around various locations , collecting increasingly larger objects , ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains , until the ball has grown great enough to become a star . Katamari Damacy 's story , characters , and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized , rarely attempting any semblance of realism , though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game 's production . 
 Overall , Katamari Damacy was well received in Japan and North America . The game was dubbed a sleeper hit , and won several awards . Katamari Damacy inspired the development of other video games , and led to the release of eight sequels in Japan and other territories : We Love Katamari ( PlayStation 2 ) , Me & My Katamari ( PlayStation Portable ) , Beautiful Katamari ( Xbox 360 ) , i Love Katamari ( iOS , Windows Phone 7 , Android ) , Katamari Forever ( PlayStation 3 ) , Katamari Amore ( iOS ) , Touch My Katamari ( PlayStation Vita ) , and Tap My Katamari ( iOS , Android ) 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The primary story in Katamari Damacy deals with the aftermath of the planet @-@ sized King of All Cosmos ' binge drinking spree that wiped out all the stars and other celestial bodies from the sky . The King ( who appears to be chronically dissatisfied with his 5 @-@ cm @-@ tall son 's small size ) charges the Prince to go to Earth with a " katamari " — a magical ball that allows anything smaller than it to stick to it and make it grow — and collect enough material for him to recreate the stars and constellations . The Prince is successful , and the sky is returned to normal . 
 A side @-@ story follows the Hoshino family as the Prince works at his tasks . The father , an astronaut , is unable to go to the moon after it is wiped out by the King , and the daughter , whose name is Michiru , " senses " the Prince 's work — she can feel when each constellation returns to the sky . Ultimately , the family , along with their house and town , are rolled up in the katamari that is used to remake the moon . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player controls the Prince as he rolls the katamari around houses , gardens , and towns in order to meet certain parameters set by the King of All Cosmos . The player uses the two analog sticks on the DualShock controller in a manner similar to the classic arcade game Battlezone to control the direction the katamari rolls . Other controls can be triggered by the player to gain a quick burst of speed , flip the Prince to the other side of the katamari , and more . 
 Objects that are smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them , while greater objects can be hurdles ; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari , slowing the player 's progress . The game uses size , weight , and surface area to determine if an object will stick to the katamari . This allows slender objects , such as pencils , that are longer than the katamari is wide , to be picked up , and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up . Animals such as cats will chase the katamari , knocking things from it , but once the katamari is great enough , it will scare the animals away , and they can be rolled up once they are chased down . As objects stick to the katamari , the katamari will grow , eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up , and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked . In this manner , the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants , and slowly work up to the point where the katamari is picking up buildings , mountains , and clouds . 
 The typical mission given by the King of All Cosmos is the " Make a Star " mode , where the player needs to grow the katamari to a specific size within a given timeframe . Other missions have more specific collecting rules , such as collecting as many items ( swans , crabs , pairs ) as possible within a given time , or collecting the largest item possible ( such as a cow or bear ) . The player can attempt a score attack mode for any level , in which they try to make the greatest katamari possible in the time allotted . Certain levels can unlock an " eternal mode " by creating an exceptionally large katamari . In eternal modes , the player can explore the level with no time limit . 
 Each level features two secret items that can be found . The first item is a royal present that contains an object that the Prince can wear . Most gifts are non @-@ functional , but one includes a camera that can be used to take in @-@ game screenshots . The other secret item is a cousin of the Prince , which , once rolled up in main gameplay , can be used as a character in the various multiplayer modes . However , cousins can only be found and rolled up after the game is beaten . The game also tracks which objects the player has collected at any time , allowing them to review all the various objects within the game . 
 In the two @-@ player mode , a player can choose to play as either the Prince or one of his numerous Cousins . The screen is split vertically ; player one , and player two is on the right . Players compete simultaneously in a small arena to collect the most objects within three minutes . The playfield is replenished with new objects periodically . Players can ram into each other , knocking items from their opponents ' <unk> , and if one player leads by a fair amount , then it is possible to roll up the opponent 's katamari . 
 = = Development = = 
 Toru Iwatani , head of research and development for Namco , stated that the idea for Katamari Damacy resulted from Keita Takahashi 's school project from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory , a sponsored institute for game development education . Keita Takahashi 's final thesis bore out the core gameplay ideas , while a team of ten ( including the student ) developed the final product . The game was developed for less than US $ 1 million , a tenth of the cost of Namco blockbuster titles such as Ridge Racer or Soulcalibur . The game took a year and a half to develop , with eight months of prototyping . 
 Lead developer Keita Takahashi said that the team was aiming for four key points in developing the game : novelty , ease of understanding , enjoyment , and humor . Iwatani compared the game to Namco 's Pac @-@ Man , which focused on simplicity and innovation , and served as a template for future games from the company . At one point during development , Takahashi " proactively ignored " advice from Namco to increase the complexity of the game . 
 The core gameplay of Katamari Damacy is the subject of U.S. Patent 7 @,@ 402 @,@ 104 , " Game performing method , game apparatus , storage medium , data signal and program " . The patent , issued in 2009 , primarily describes how the game maintains the roughly spherical nature of the katamari when objects are picked up , though extends to concepts such as tracking objects collected based on temperature or weight values , which were modes included with later games of the series . 
 = = = Reveal and release = = = 
 Katamari Damacy was first revealed at the 2003 Tokyo Game Show , at which the press dubbed it a " snowball simulator " . The image featured on the cover of the pre @-@ release demo showed the large red ball used in " <unk> " , a game played at Japanese school sports meets ( <unk> ) that was an influence for the game . Plans for releasing the game in Western countries were tied to its performance in Japan . Katamari Damacy was first shown in the United States at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop during the March 2004 Game Developers Conference . Due to its popularity at trade shows and a write @-@ in campaign , Namco decided to release the game in the United States . 
 = = = Name = = = 
 In Japanese , Katamari ( <unk> ) means " clump " or " clod " and Damashii is the <unk> form of <unk> ( 魂 ) which means " soul " or " spirit " . Therefore , the phrase approximates to " clump soul " . The two kanji that form the name look similar ( sharing the same right @-@ side element <unk> ) , in a kind of visual alliteration . The name is officially transliterated as Katamari Damacy in most releases . In an interview with Dengeki Online , producer Keita Takahashi said that when asked about the title , " It just popped into my head suddenly , and this is what it has been from the beginning . " 
 = = = Soundtrack = = = 
 The music in Katamari Damacy was widely hailed as imaginative and original ( winning both IGN 's and GameSpot 's " Soundtrack of the Year 2004 " awards ) , and was considered one of the game 's best features . The soundtrack was released in Japan as Katamari Fortissimo Damacy . Its eclectic composition featured elements of traditional electronic video game music , as well as heavy jazz and samba influences ( Shibuya @-@ kei ) . Most of the tracks were composed by Yuu Miyake , and many feature vocals from popular J @-@ pop singers , such as Yui Asaka from the <unk> Deka 3 TV series , and anime voice actors , including <unk> Matsubara and Ado <unk> . One track is sung and written by Charlie Kosei , composer of the Lupin III soundtrack . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Katamari Damacy enjoyed moderate success in Japan . The game was sold at about two @-@ thirds of the price of a new game at the time . It was the top selling game the week of its release with 32 @,@ 000 units sold , and sold over 155 @,@ 000 copies in Japan by the end of 2004 . However , Namco originally estimated that over 500 @,@ 000 units would be sold in Japan . 
 Katamari Damacy was one of the recipients of the 2004 Good Design Award in Japan , the first time a video game has won this award . The game was included at a 2012 exhibit at the New York Museum of Modern Art , entitled " Century of the Child : Growing by Design " , and was used to demonstrate the change in toys and playthings over the 20th century , specifically praising the game for its " quirky manipulations of scale " that makes it accessible for all ages . In 2015 , the game placed 13th on USgamer 's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list . 
 The game was not released in PAL territories such as Europe and Australia , since publishers thought it was too " quirky " for these markets ; however , Electronic Arts picked up both sequels , We Love Katamari and Me & My Katamari , for release in Europe . 
 The North American release of the game was very well received by professional reviewers , was mentioned and praised on TechTV , and was a featured sidebar in the May 23 , 2004 , edition of Time magazine . Time continued to praise the game in its November 22 , 2004 " Best games of the year " special , calling it " the most unusual and original game to hit PlayStation2 " . Most retailers underestimated the demand for such a quirky game , and only purchased a few copies of this sleeper hit ; it rapidly sold out nationwide , with sales surpassing 120 @,@ 000 units in North America . It also won the U.S. award for " Excellence in Game Design " at the 2005 Game Developers Choice Awards , and G4 awarded Katamari Damacy its " Best Innovation " prize in its G @-@ Phoria of that year . 
 Although the game has rapidly achieved a cult following and has been praised by many reviewers , it also has its share of criticism . A common complaint is that the game is relatively short and repetitive — it can be completed in under ten hours , and the gameplay stays virtually the same all the way through . However , others , such as Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer Mark McDonald ( who gave the game 8 @.@ 5 out of ten with his EGM staff ) , argue that the game 's limitations are made up for by its strengths : " Sure , you 're basically doing the same thing each mission , but Katamari 's elegant controls , killer soundtrack , and wicked humor make it perfectly suited for replay . " As a well @-@ executed , non @-@ traditional game , Katamari Damacy has been influential in the game development community . Since its release , a number of designers have developed works inspired by Katamari : one example is The Wonderful End of the World . 
 = = Sequels = = 
 Katamari Damacy has spawned numerous sequels on the PlayStation 2 and newer game consoles . The game 's direct sequel on the PlayStation 2 , We Love Katamari ( <unk> , Minna Daisuki Katamari Damashii , literally Everyone Loves Katamari Damacy ) , was released internationally in 2005 and 2006 . Its story is self @-@ referential , following on the success of the first game , most of the levels are based on requests from newfound fans of the King and the Prince . Though sharing the same mechanics , We Love Katamari introduces new gameplay features , such as co @-@ operative play , and new goals , such as collecting the most valuable objects , that would continue through its sequels . Me & My Katamari ( <unk> , Boku no Watashi no Katamari Damashii , literally My My Katamari Damacy using the two words in Japanese for " I " which connote a masculine ( ' boku ' ) or neutral ( ' <unk> ' ) speaker ) was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2005 and 2006 , featuring levels based on helping the animals of an island devastated by a tsunami . 
 Beautiful Katamari ( Beautiful Katamari Damacy ( <unk> , Byūtifuru Katamari Damashii ) ) was an Xbox 360 title released in 2007 and 2008 , following the Royal Family using <unk> to close up a black hole created while the King was playing tennis . The newer console allowed for higher @-@ resolution graphics and support for online network play , leaderboards , and downloadable content . While PlayStation 3 and Wii ports were planned for Beautiful Katamari , these never were released . Katamari Forever ( Katamari Damacy Tribute ( <unk> , Katamari Damashii <unk> ) ) was released for the PlayStation 3 internationally in 2009 . Katamari Forever incorporates a mix of previous levels from the series , framed around the King trying to recover from amnesia , and new levels where the katamari is needed to repair damage done by a rampaging " <unk> " . It further improved on the graphics capabilities of Beautiful Katamari , and introduced new moves for the player . 
 <unk> Puzzle Katamari Damacy was released for the Nintendo DSi via DSiWare in 2009 . Similar in play to Tetris , the player used the prince to drop a katamari into the playing field to clear the puzzle field . Touch My Katamari ( Katamari Damacy No @-@ Vita ( <unk> , Katamari <unk> <unk> ) ) is a regional launch title for the PlayStation Vita portable game system in late 2011 and early 2012 . The No @-@ Vita moniker is a play on the Vita console name and the Japanese word <unk> , meaning " to lengthen or extend " . While the core mechanics are similar to other games in the series , Touch My Katamari allows the player to use the rear touch @-@ pad on the Vita to temporarily stretch the katamari into an ovoid shape , allowing it to roll through narrow spaces or collect small objects . 
 Several mobile versions have also been released . Rolling With Katamari was released in Japan in 2007 for the Mitsubishi <unk> series of phones , using their tilt @-@ sensitive technology to let the player control the katamari . It was ported to <unk> for release in other countries . Katamari Damacy Mobile was released in 2009 for several wireless devices , and is a 2D side @-@ scrolling version of Katamari Damacy similar to a mini @-@ mode included with Me & My Katamari . I Love Katamari was released in 2008 for the iPhone and iPod Touch , with later patched for the iPad and other iOS devices and for Windows Phone 7 . Another iOS game , Katamari Amore , was released in early 2011 . 
 <unk> , a South Korean developer , announced plans for a Katamari Damacy Online game , which was due to be released in 2007 . It was never brought to the US .

 The horse is owned by Michael Lauffer and W.D. Cubbedge . Lauffer was previously a co @-@ owner of the filly Rachel Alexandra , prior to her 2009 Preakness win . Initially , Lauffer and Cubbedge had put Shackleford up for sale as a yearling at the Keeneland auction , but when the bids failed to reach the reserve price of $ 275 @,@ 000 , Cubbedge and Lauffer bought back the colt and kept him .

 Shackleford is trained by Dale Romans . The colt 's first race was on October 16 , 2010 , where he finished ninth in a 7 ⁄ 8 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) $ 44 @,@ 000 maiden special weight race at Keeneland Race Course on a synthetic surface . That race was won by eventual Blue Grass Stakes runner @-@ up and Kentucky Derby starter <unk> . In November 2010 , his second start , Shackleford won a $ 59 @,@ 000 maiden special weight race at Churchill Downs on dirt at 7 ⁄ 8 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) , taking the rail down the stretch and prevailing over a field of 11 . 
 = = 2011 : three @-@ year @-@ old season = = 
 Shackleford 's first start as a three @-@ year @-@ old was an allowance race at Gulfstream Park on February 5 , 2011 , at 1 1 ⁄ 8 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) . He was ridden by his soon @-@ to @-@ be regular jockey , Jesus Castanon . In that race , he broke well and stalked the leader from second position , then put on a burst of speed and drew clear to win . Romans next entered Shackleford in the Grade II Fountain of Youth Stakes on February 26 at Gulfstream Park . In that race , he was far back early and attempted to rally on the far turn but was hung out wide . He faltered in the stretch and finished fifth to Soldat . 
 In April 2011 , Shackleford was entered in the Grade 1 $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 Florida Derby , again at Gulfstream . He drew post number 5 and was listed at post time as a 60 @-@ 1 longshot . Breaking slowly , he floated wide going into the club house turn . On that turn , he took over the lead from Arch Traveler and To Honor and Serve in a field that stretched 14 lengths back to Dialed In at the rear . Shackleford led down the back stretch and around the final turn , setting a 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ mile ( 800 m ) fraction of 46 @.@ 3 and a 3 ⁄ 4 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) in 1 : 10 @.@ 6 . At the top of the lane , he was challenged by To Honor and Serve and repelled him . Three strides from the wire , he was caught by eventual Kentucky Derby co @-@ favorite Dialed In and just missed the win , finishing second by a head . 
 That second @-@ place finish earned Shackleford a purse of $ 200 @,@ 000 and enough graded earnings to enter the Kentucky Derby . In addition , by virtue of his start in the Fountain of Youth Stakes and his top @-@ three finish in the Florida Derby , the colt became eligible for the XpressBet Consolation Bonus $ 550 @,@ 000 , part of the Preakness 5 @.@ 5 Million Dollar Bonus program , if he won the Preakness Stakes . The bonus would pay $ 500 @,@ 000 to the owner and $ 50 @,@ 000 to the trainer of a Preakness winner who had finished in the top 3 of either the Florida Derby or the Santa Anita Derby and finished in one of a set of other listed races .

 In the 2011 Kentucky Derby , Shackleford broke well and outran Comma To the Top for the lead passing the stands for the first time . He continued to lead around the clubhouse turn and into the stretch . With about 200 yards ( 183 m ) to go , he was overtaken by the eventual winner , Animal Kingdom , who won by 2 3 / 4 lengths . Meanwhile , Shackleford , now in second place with about 50 yards ( 46 m ) left to go , was caught by Nehro and Mucho Macho Man . He finished fourth by a length and a half in the field of 20 . 
 Two weeks later , at the 2011 Preakness Stakes , Shackleford went off at odds of 13 @-@ 1 . He broke from the 5 gate in a capacity field of 14 . Passing the grandstand for the first time , Flashpoint took the lead with Shackleford at his flank in a fast 22 @-@ 3 / 5 for the first 1 ⁄ 4 @-@ mile ( 402 m ) . Down the backstretch , the leaders slowed the pace , clocking 3 ⁄ 4 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) in 1 : 12 @.@ 01 . At the top of the home stretch , Shackleford took the lead . Astrology challenged him until the 200 yards ( 183 m ) mark . Castanon then used the whip and Shackleford accelerated , holding off the strong late charge of Animal Kingdom to win by half a length . 
 <unk> on Shackleford paid $ 27 @.@ 20 , $ 10 @.@ 20 and $ 6 @.@ 80 . With that win , Shackleford became the beneficiary of the largest payoff purse in Preakness history . He won $ 600 @,@ 000 for coming in first in the Preakness and $ 550 @,@ 000 as the XpressBet Bonus winner for a total payout of $ 1 @,@ 150 @,@ 000 . 
 On June 11 , 2011 , the three year @-@ old finished fifth in the Belmont Stakes after holding the lead for much of the race on a sloppy track . As the pacesetter , Shackleford led throughout most of the 1 @-@ 1 / 2 mile race , which started with a moderate quarter @-@ mile in : 23 @.@ 9 , then slowed to a leisurely : 49 @.@ 0 for the opening half , 1 : 14 @.@ 5 for three @-@ quarters , and 1 : 39 @.@ 9 for a mile .

 Shackleford 's first- and fourth @-@ place finishes in Preakness Stakes and Kentucky Derby respectively handed the Triple Crown 's consolation title to Animal Kingdom . But Shackleford ended the trifecta of classic races with the a second @-@ place finish in the Triple Crown Productions ' Highest combined Triple Crown finish for the 2011 season . He was <unk> three year @-@ old archrival Animal Kingdom by three points , 15 points to 12 points . Ruler on Ice finished third with ten points and Nehro finished fourth with six points . That finish put Shackleford squarely in contention ( along with Animal Kingdom ) for the " Eclipse Award " as the American Champion Three @-@ Year @-@ Old Male Horse .

 On July 31 , 2011 , Shackleford lost by a head in the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park in New Jersey to the Bob Baffert @-@ trained colt Coil , who had a six @-@ pound weight break advantage . In that race , Shackleford stumbled at the start , then caught up down the backstretch . Around the final turn , he took the lead . On August 27 , 2011 , Shackleford was eighth in the 2011 Travers Stakes , which was won by the Pletcher @-@ trained colt Stay Thirsty . On October 1 , 2011 , he finished second to Wilburn in the Indiana Derby . On November 5 , 2011 , he ran second to Caleb 's Posse in the Breeders ' Cup Dirt Mile . On January 3 , 2012 Shackleford was nominated as one of three finalists at the Eclipse Award for American Champion Three @-@ Year @-@ Old Male Horse , but the award went to Animal Kingdom .

 On February 11 , Shackleford was seventh out of a field of eleven horses in the Grade 1 Donn Handicap run at Gulfstream Park . Ruler on Ice also ran and finished eighth . On April 7 , 2012 , Shackleford ran in the $ 400 @,@ 000 Grade 1 Carter Handicap at seven furlongs at Aqueduct Racetrack . Longshot Jackson Bend won by a nose over Caleb 's Posse , with Shackleford another length and a half back in third . 
 Returning to Churchill Downs on Derby Day , May 5 , 2012 , Shackleford raced in the $ 400 @,@ 000 Grade 2 Churchill Downs Stakes at seven furlongs on the dirt . In that race , he beat the favorite , American Champion Sprint Horse <unk> , by a length . The two horses separated themselves from the rest of the field by five lengths with Shackleford on the inside . Just inside the sixteenth pole , he edged away and beat <unk> under jockey Mike Smith by a length . Gantry was another five and a half lengths back in the third . The time was 1 : 21 on a fast track . 
 On Memorial Day , May 28 , 2012 , Shackleford raced in what analysts called the deepest field of the year featuring favorites To Honor and Serve , Caleb 's Posse , Jackson Bend and Caixa Eletronica in the $ 750 @,@ 000 Grade 1 Metropolitan Handicap ( known by most as the Met Mile run at one mile on the dirt at Belmont Park ) . Shackleford had just enough left to withstand the furious late rush of Caleb 's Posse , stopping the clock in 1 : 33 1 / 5 over the fast track to win by a nose . Favorite To Honor and Serve was another three and half lengths back in third . With this win , Shackleford turned the tables on old rival Caleb 's Posse , who beat him in the 2011 Breeders ' Cup Dirt Mile . The horses met each other four times , with each winning two races . However , Caleb 's Posse retired soon after the Met Mile . 
 On November 23 , Shackleford ended his career with a victory in the Grade 1 , $ 500 @,@ 000 Clark Handicap at Churchill Downs with Preakness jockey Castanon on board . He defeated Take Charge Indy by one length in the 1 @-@ 1 / 8 mile race that he completed in a time of 1 : 49 @.@ 12 seconds .

 Shackleford was retired to stud duty in November 2012 and was sent to the Darby Dan Farm in Lexington , Kentucky . He will stand for a $ 20 @,@ 000 stud fee for the 2013 breeding season . His first foals will race in 2016 . 
 = = Pedigree = = 
 Shackleford was sired by Forestry , and out of Oatsee , a daughter of Unbridled . Oatsee was purchased in 2006 by Shackleford 's owners for $ 135 @,@ 000 , and after giving birth to Shackleford , was bred to A.P. Indy and sold , in foal , for $ 1 @.@ 55 million . His pedigree traces to major sires of significance . 
 Shackleford has champion breeding lines on both sides . Northern Dancer , the paternal great @-@ grand sire of Forestry , was a four @-@ time leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland , leading sire in North America ( 1971 ) , and the leading broodmare sire in North America ( 1991 ) . He also traces on his sire 's side to fourth generation sires , Secretariat , His Majesty and Dr. <unk> , who were all leading sires . Mr. Prospector , the paternal great @-@ grandsire of his dam Oatsee , was a nine @-@ time leading broodmare sire in North America twice the leading sire in North America . Shackleford 's grandsire , Storm Cat , was a two @-@ time leading sire in North America and his maternal grandsire is Unbridled , who sired multiple winners of various Triple Crown races . 
 Shackleford inherits speed through his sire , Forestry , who had his most notable wins at one @-@ turn events : the Grade 1 7 ⁄ 8 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) King 's Bishop Stakes at Saratoga and the Grade 2 1 1 ⁄ 16 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 700 m ) Dwyer Stakes at Belmont . Most of Forestry 's notable progeny are similarly described , with a few exceptions . In addition , Forestry 's maternal grandsire was Pleasant Colony , who won both the Kentucky Derby and , like Shackleford , the Preakness Stakes . Shackleford inherits stamina through his dam . His breeding is considered most similar to Etched , another son of Forestry who is a two @-@ time Grade 2 winner at 1 1 ⁄ 8 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) . Both inherited stamina from Unbridled @-@ line mares , with Etched having Unbridled 's Song as a grandsire and Shackleford 's grandsire being Unbridled himself . Oatsee has transmitted Unbridled 's stamina , producing six racing foals of whom four have been winners including Lady Joanne , who won the Alabama Stakes and <unk> , winner of the <unk> Stakes , Grade 3 Iowa Oaks and G3 Indiana Oaks . Unbridled was a 1 1 ⁄ 4 @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 000 m ) specialist who won both the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders ' Cup Classic in 1990 . Unbridled has sired progeny who separately won each of the Triple Crown races , including Grindstone , Red Bullet , and Empire Maker , achieving the feat only three years after his grandsire Mr. Prospector did with <unk> Pegasus , Tank 's Prospect and Conquistador Cielo . Shackleford 's pedigree chart is as follows : 
 = So Seductive = 
 " So Seductive " is a song by American rapper Tony Yayo . <unk> as the first single from his debut studio album Thoughts of a Predicate Felon ( 2005 ) , it features guest vocals from fellow rapper 50 Cent , and was produced by record producer Punch , who helped write the song along with Yayo and 50 Cent . Released following a highly publicized campaign by Yayo 's record label , G @-@ Unit Records , to release Yayo from a prison sentence being served prior to the song 's release , " So Seductive " is an uptempo " club banger " containing elements of string instruments and a repetitive bassline in its instrumentation . The song received little promotion from Yayo at the time of its release , as he was still under house arrest following the end of his prison sentence , although he has since performed the song during various live performances . 
 " So Seductive " became Yayo 's most commercially successful song , reaching number 48 on the US Billboard Hot 100 ; it also remains Yayo 's only song to chart outside the United States , peaking in the top 30 of the Irish and United Kingdom singles charts . The song received generally positive reviews from music critics , who complimented its energy and 50 Cent 's performance in the chorus , although some wrote negatively towards Yayo 's rapping and also noted a lack of originality in the song 's production . " So Seductive " was nominated for best " Club Banger " at the 2005 Vibe Awards , but lost to " 1 Thing " by Amerie .

 On December 31 , 2002 , G @-@ Unit rappers Tony Yayo and 50 Cent were arrested for illegal weapon possession . Following a further background check , it was discovered that Yayo had an outstanding warrant for a previous such charge : as a result , he was sentenced for bail jumping , and spent the entirety of 2003 in prison at Lakeview Shock Incarceration Correctional Facility . During this time , 50 Cent and the other members of G @-@ Unit rose to mainstream prominence following the commercial success of 50 Cent 's album Get Rich or Die Tryin ' ( 2003 ) , which sold 872 @,@ 000 copies in its first week on sale in the United States and contained the Billboard number @-@ one singles " In da Club " and " 21 Questions " . The group also released their debut album , Beg for Mercy , in 2003 , which featured the US top @-@ 15 singles " Stunt 101 " and " Wanna Get to Know You " . Yayo appeared on the song " Like My Style " , which appears on Get Rich or Die Tryin ' , and on the songs " <unk> Love " and " I Smell Pussy " , which are included on Beg for Mercy . 
 During Yayo 's incarceration , the G @-@ Unit members began a campaign called " Free Yayo " , which involved wearing " Free Yayo " shirts advertising his situation ; due to the mainstream prominence of the group , Yayo thus began to receive increased attention from the hip @-@ hop community , becoming known as the " mythical fourth member of G @-@ Unit " , although Yayo himself was unaware of the coverage he attracted . The campaign received widespread publicity , even in countries such as Brazil and Iraq . At the 46th Grammy Awards , 50 Cent and fellow rapper Eminem performed whilst wearing " Free Yayo " shirts . Yayo watched the performance on television in prison after receiving a call from the Shady Records offices advising him to do so ; he had never seen the shirts before , and was inspired by them to work hard to improve his rapping before his release from prison . He was granted parole from his sentence on January 8 , 2004 , but was discovered to be in possession of a forged passport , following a check from his parole officer , and was sent back to prison until May 25 , 2004 . 
 Following his release , Yayo appeared on several mixtapes to increase his exposure amongst underground hip hop audiences , and began to record his debut studio album , titled Thoughts of a Predicate Felon ( 2005 ) , almost immediately after leaving prison , although he was still detained under house arrest and required to wear an ankle bracelet , and thus could not personally promote any of the album 's material . " So Seductive " was released as the album 's first single via Interscope Records in the United States and Canada on May 17 , 2005 via digital download , and was released to rhythmic and urban contemporary radio stations in the United States on May 24 , 2005 . The CD single was distributed via Polydor Records .

He isn ’ t a very good rapper , but he is an entertaining personality and crew @-@ member . " David Jeffries of Allmusic described " So Seductive " as a " hooky party number " that Yayo " handles extremely well " , citing it as an example of how he " [ is ] <unk> and smarter than expected considering the thug myth built around him " . Writing for The Michigan Daily , Evan McGarvey observed that the song works as a " <unk> first single " , calling it an " open @-@ palm slap of a tune " . He also complimented 50 Cent 's performance , writing that he " wisely takes a verse of his own and laces the track with an easy , Richard Scary hook " . However , Fiona McKinlay of musicOMH denounced Yayo 's rapping on the song , calling his vocals " really pretty disappointing " . She also criticized the song 's production as unoriginal , noting that " there 's nothing catchy , nothing memorable and it 's not even any good for shaking your booty to " , and concluded that " as anything other than musical wallpaper , [ the song ] is about as much use as soggy toast " , although she conceded that it was " probably going to be a Top Ten smash " . At the 2005 Vibe Awards , " So Seductive " was nominated for best " Club Banger " , but lost to " 1 Thing " by singer <unk> .

 = Anaphylaxis = 
 Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death . It typically causes more than one of the following : an itchy rash , throat or tongue swelling , shortness of breath , vomiting , lightheadedness , and low blood pressure . These symptoms typically come on over minutes to hours . 
 Common causes include insect bites and stings , foods , and medications . Other causes include latex exposure and exercise . Additionally cases may occur without an obvious reason . The mechanism involves the release of mediators from certain types of white blood cells triggered by either immunologic or non @-@ immunologic mechanisms . Diagnosis is based on the presenting symptoms and signs after exposure to a potential allergen . 
 The primary treatment of anaphylaxis is epinephrine injection into a muscle , intravenous fluids , and positioning the person flat . Additional doses of epinephrine may be required . Other measures , such as antihistamines and steroids , are complementary . Carrying an epinephrine <unk> and identification regarding the condition is recommended in people with a history of anaphylaxis . 
 Worldwide , 0 @.@ 05 – 2 % of the population is estimated to experience anaphylaxis at some point in life . Rates appear to be increasing . It occurs most often in young people and females . Of people who go to a hospital with anaphylaxis in the United States about 0 @.@ 3 % die . The term comes from the Ancient Greek : ἀνά ana " against " , and the Ancient Greek : <unk> phylaxis " protection " . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Anaphylaxis typically presents many different symptoms over minutes or hours with an average onset of 5 to 30 minutes if exposure is intravenous and 2 hours if from eating food . The most common areas affected include : skin ( 80 – 90 % ) , respiratory ( 70 % ) , gastrointestinal ( 30 – 45 % ) , heart and vasculature ( 10 – 45 % ) , and central nervous system ( 10 – 15 % ) with usually two or more being involved . 
 = = = Skin = = = 
 Symptoms typically include generalized hives , itchiness , flushing , or swelling ( angioedema ) of the afflicted tissues . Those with angioedema may describe a burning sensation of the skin rather than itchiness . Swelling of the tongue or throat occurs in up to about 20 % of cases . Other features may include a runny nose and swelling of the conjunctiva . The skin may also be blue tinged because of lack of oxygen . 
 = = = Respiratory = = = 
 Respiratory symptoms and signs that may be present include shortness of breath , <unk> , or stridor . The wheezing is typically caused by spasms of the bronchial muscles while stridor is related to upper airway obstruction secondary to swelling . <unk> , pain with swallowing , or a cough may also occur . 
 = = = Cardiovascular = = = 
 <unk> artery spasm may occur with subsequent myocardial infarction , dysrhythmia , or cardiac arrest . Those with underlying coronary disease are at greater risk of cardiac effects from anaphylaxis . The coronary spasm is related to the presence of histamine @-@ releasing cells in the heart . While a fast heart rate caused by low blood pressure is more common , a <unk> – Jarisch reflex has been described in 10 % of cases where a slow heart rate is associated with low blood pressure . A drop in blood pressure or shock ( either distributive or cardiogenic ) may cause the feeling of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness . Rarely very low blood pressure may be the only sign of anaphylaxis . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 Gastrointestinal symptoms may include <unk> abdominal pain , diarrhea , and vomiting . There may be confusion , a loss of bladder control or pelvic pain similar to that of uterine cramps . Dilation of blood vessels around the brain may cause headaches . A feeling of anxiety or of " impending doom " has also been described . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Anaphylaxis can occur in response to almost any foreign substance . Common triggers include venom from insect bites or stings , foods , and medication . Foods are the most common trigger in children and young adults while medications and insect bites and stings are more common in older adults . Less common causes include : physical factors , biological agents such as semen , latex , hormonal changes , food additives such as monosodium glutamate and food colors , and topical medications . Physical factors such as exercise ( known as exercise @-@ induced anaphylaxis ) or temperature ( either hot or cold ) may also act as triggers through their direct effects on mast cells . Events caused by exercise are frequently associated with the ingestion of certain foods . During anesthesia , neuromuscular blocking agents , antibiotics , and latex are the most common causes . The cause remains unknown in 32 – 50 % of cases , referred to as " idiopathic anaphylaxis . " Six vaccines ( MMR , varicella , influenza , hepatitis B , tetanus , meningococcal ) are recognized as a cause for anaphylaxis , and HPV may cause anaphylaxis as well . 
 = = = Food = = = 
 Many foods can trigger anaphylaxis ; this may occur upon the first known ingestion . Common triggering foods vary around the world . In Western cultures , ingestion of or exposure to peanuts , wheat , nuts , certain types of seafood like shellfish , milk , and eggs are the most prevalent causes . Sesame is common in the Middle East , while rice and chickpeas are frequently encountered as sources of anaphylaxis in Asia . Severe cases are usually caused by ingesting the allergen , but some people experience a severe reaction upon contact . Children can outgrow their allergies . By age 16 , 80 % of children with anaphylaxis to milk or eggs and 20 % who experience isolated anaphylaxis to peanuts can tolerate these foods . 
 = = = Medication = = = 
 Any medication may potentially trigger anaphylaxis . The most common are β @-@ lactam antibiotics ( such as penicillin ) followed by aspirin and NSAIDs . Other antibiotics are implicated less frequently , and the reactions to NSAIDs are agent specific meaning that those who are allergic to one NSAID can typically tolerate a different one . Other relatively common causes include chemotherapy , vaccines , <unk> and herbal preparations . Some medications ( vancomycin , morphine , x @-@ ray contrast among others ) cause anaphylaxis by directly triggering mast cell degranulation . 
 The frequency of a reaction to an agent partly depends on the frequency of its use and partly on its intrinsic properties . Anaphylaxis to penicillin or cephalosporins occurs only after it binds to proteins inside the body with some agents binding more easily than others . Anaphylaxis to penicillin occurs once in every 2 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 courses of treatment , with death occurring in fewer than one in every 50 @,@ 000 courses of treatment . Anaphylaxis to aspirin and NSAIDs occurs in about one in every 50 @,@ 000 persons . If someone has a reaction to penicillins , his or her risk of a reaction to cephalosporins is greater but still less than one in 1 @,@ 000 . The old radiocontrast agents caused reactions in 1 % of cases , while the newer lower <unk> agents cause reactions in 0 @.@ 04 % of cases . 
 = = = Venom = = = 
 Venom from stinging or biting insects such as Hymenoptera ( ants , bees and wasps ) or Triatominae ( kissing bugs ) may cause anaphylaxis in susceptible people . Previous systemic reactions , which are anything more than a local reaction around the site of the sting , are a risk factor for future anaphylaxis ; however , half of fatalities have had no previous systemic reaction . 
 = = = Risk factors = = = 
 People with atopic diseases such as asthma , eczema , or allergic rhinitis are at high risk of anaphylaxis from food , latex , and radiocontrast agents but not from injectable medications or stings . One study in children found that 60 % had a history of previous atopic diseases , and of children who die from anaphylaxis , more than 90 % have asthma . Those with <unk> or of a higher socioeconomic status are at increased risk . The longer the time since the last exposure to the agent in question , the lower the risk . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction of rapid onset affecting many body systems . It is due to the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines from mast cells and basophils , typically due to an immunologic reaction but sometimes non @-@ immunologic mechanism . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 In the immunologic mechanism , immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) binds to the antigen ( the foreign material that provokes the allergic reaction ) . Antigen @-@ bound IgE then activates <unk> receptors on mast cells and basophils . This leads to the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine . These mediators subsequently increase the contraction of bronchial smooth muscles , trigger vasodilation , increase the leakage of fluid from blood vessels , and cause heart muscle depression . There is also an immunologic mechanism that does not rely on IgE , but it is not known if this occurs in humans . 
 = = = Non @-@ immunologic = = = 
 Non @-@ immunologic mechanisms involve substances that directly cause the degranulation of mast cells and basophils . These include agents such as contrast medium , opioids , temperature ( hot or cold ) , and vibration . <unk> may cause reactions by both immunologic and non @-@ immunologic mechanisms . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Anaphylaxis is diagnosed on the basis of a person 's signs and symptoms . When any one of the following three occurs within minutes or hours of exposure to an allergen there is a high likelihood of anaphylaxis : 
 Involvement of the skin or mucosal tissue plus either respiratory difficulty or a low blood pressure causing symptoms 
 Two or more of the following symptoms after a likely contact with an allergen : 
 a . Involvement of the skin or mucosa 
 b . Respiratory difficulties 
 c . Low blood pressure 
 d . Gastrointestinal symptoms 
 Low blood pressure after exposure to a known allergen 
 Skin involvement may include : hives , itchiness or a swollen tongue among others . Respiratory difficulties may include : shortness of breath , stridor , or low oxygen levels among others . Low blood pressure is defined as a greater than 30 % decrease from a person 's usual blood pressure . In adults a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg is often used . 
 During an attack , blood tests for <unk> or histamine ( released from mast cells ) might be useful in diagnosing anaphylaxis due to insect stings or medications . However these tests are of limited use if the cause is food or if the person has a normal blood pressure , and they are not specific for the diagnosis . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 There are three main classifications of anaphylaxis . <unk> shock is associated with systemic vasodilation that causes low blood pressure which is by definition 30 % lower than the person 's baseline or below standard values . <unk> anaphylaxis is the recurrence of symptoms within 1 – 72 hours with no further exposure to the allergen . Reports of incidence vary , with some studies claiming as many as 20 % of cases . The recurrence typically occurs within 8 hours . It is managed in the same manner as anaphylaxis . <unk> or anaphylactoid reactions are a type of anaphylaxis that does not involve an allergic reaction but is due to direct mast cell degranulation . Non @-@ immune anaphylaxis is the current term used by the World Allergy Organization with some recommending that the old terminology no longer be used . 
 = = = Allergy testing = = = 
 Allergy testing may help in determining the trigger . Skin allergy testing ( such as patch testing ) is available for certain foods and venoms . Blood testing for specific IgE can be useful to confirm milk , egg , peanut , tree nut and fish allergies . 
 Skin testing is available to confirm penicillin allergies , but is not available for other medications . Non @-@ immune forms of anaphylaxis can only be determined by history or exposure to the allergen in question , and not by skin or blood testing . 
 = = = Differential diagnosis = = = 
 It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish anaphylaxis from asthma , syncope , and panic attacks . Asthma however typically does not entail itching or gastrointestinal symptoms , syncope presents with pallor rather than a rash , and a panic attack may have flushing but does not have hives . Other conditions that may present similarly include : <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = = Post @-@ mortem findings = = = 
 In a person who died from anaphylaxis , autopsy may show an " empty heart " attributed to reduced venous return from vasodilation and redistribution of intravascular volume from the central to the peripheral compartment . Other signs are laryngeal edema , <unk> in lungs , heart and tissues , and evidence of myocardial <unk> . Laboratory findings could detect increased levels of serum <unk> , increase in total and specific IgE serum levels . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Avoidance of the trigger of anaphylaxis is recommended . In cases where this may not be possible , desensitization may be an option . Immunotherapy with Hymenoptera venoms is effective at desensitizing 80 – 90 % of adults and 98 % of children against allergies to bees , wasps , hornets , yellowjackets , and fire ants . Oral immunotherapy may be effective at desensitizing some people to certain food including milk , eggs , nuts and peanuts ; however , adverse effects are common . <unk> is also possible for many medications , however it is advised that most people simply avoid the agent in question . In those who react to latex it may be important to avoid cross @-@ reactive foods such as avocados , bananas , and potatoes among others . 
 = = Management = = 
 Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that may require resuscitation measures such as airway management , supplemental oxygen , large volumes of intravenous fluids , and close monitoring . Administration of epinephrine is the treatment of choice with antihistamines and steroids ( for example , dexamethasone ) often used as adjuncts . A period of in @-@ hospital observation for between 2 and 24 hours is recommended for people once they have returned to normal due to concerns of biphasic anaphylaxis . 
 = = = Epinephrine = = = 
 Epinephrine ( adrenaline ) is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis with no absolute contraindication to its use . It is recommended that an epinephrine solution be given intramuscularly into the mid <unk> thigh as soon as the diagnosis is suspected . The injection may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes if there is insufficient response . A second dose is needed in 16 @-@ 35 % of episodes with more than two doses rarely required . The intramuscular route is preferred over subcutaneous administration because the latter may have delayed absorption . Minor adverse effects from epinephrine include tremors , anxiety , headaches , and palpitations . 
 People on β @-@ blockers may be resistant to the effects of epinephrine . In this situation if epinephrine is not effective intravenous glucagon can be administered which has a mechanism of action independent of β @-@ receptors . 
 If necessary , it can also be given intravenously using a dilute epinephrine solution . Intravenous epinephrine however has been associated both with dysrhythmia and myocardial infarction . Epinephrine <unk> used for self @-@ administration typically come in two doses , one for adults or children who weigh more than 25 kg and one for children who weigh 10 to 25 kg . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Antihistamines ( both H1 and H2 ) , while commonly used and assumed effective based on theoretical reasoning , are poorly supported by evidence . A 2007 Cochrane review did not find any good @-@ quality studies upon which to base recommendations and they are not believed to have an effect on airway edema or spasm . Corticosteroids are unlikely to make a difference in the current episode of anaphylaxis , but may be used in the hope of decreasing the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis . Their prophylactic effectiveness in these situations is uncertain . <unk> salbutamol may be effective for bronchospasm that does not resolve with epinephrine . Methylene blue has been used in those not responsive to other measures due to its presumed effect of relaxing smooth muscle . 
 = = = Preparedness = = = 
 People prone to anaphylaxis are advised to have an " allergy action plan . " Parents are advised to inform schools of their children 's allergies and what to do in case of an anaphylactic emergency . The action plan usually includes use of epinephrine <unk> , the recommendation to wear a medical alert bracelet , and counseling on avoidance of triggers . Immunotherapy is available for certain triggers to prevent future episodes of anaphylaxis . A multi @-@ year course of subcutaneous desensitization has been found effective against stinging insects , while oral desensitization is effective for many foods . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 In those in whom the cause is known and prompt treatment is available , the prognosis is good . Even if the cause is unknown , if appropriate preventative medication is available , the prognosis is generally good . If death occurs , it is usually due to either respiratory ( typically asphyxia ) or cardiovascular causes ( shock ) , with 0 @.@ 7 – 20 % of cases causing death . There have been cases of death occurring within minutes . Outcomes in those with exercise @-@ induced anaphylaxis are typically good , with fewer and less severe episodes as people get older . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 The number of people who get anaphylaxis is 4 – 100 per 100 @,@ 000 persons per year , with a lifetime risk of 0 @.@ 05 – 2 % . About 30 % of people get more than one attack . 
 Rates appear to be increasing : with the numbers in the 1980s being approximately 20 per 100 @,@ 000 per year , while in the 1990s it was 50 per 100 @,@ 000 per year . The increase appears to be primarily for food @-@ induced anaphylaxis . The risk is greatest in young people and females . 
 Currently , anaphylaxis leads to 500 – 1 @,@ 000 deaths per year ( 2 @.@ 4 per million ) in the United States , 20 deaths per year in the United Kingdom ( 0 @.@ 33 per million ) , and 15 deaths per year in Australia ( 0 @.@ 64 per million ) . Mortality rates have decreased between the 1970s and 2000s . In Australia , death from food @-@ induced anaphylaxis occur primarily in women while deaths due to insect bites primarily occur in males . Death from anaphylaxis is most commonly triggered by medications . 
 = = History = = 
 The term <unk> was coined by Charles <unk> in 1902 and later changed to anaphylaxis due to its nicer quality of speech . In his experiments , <unk> injected a dog with sea anemone ( <unk> ) toxin in an attempt to protect it . Although the dog had previously tolerated the toxin , on re @-@ exposure with the same dose three weeks later it developed fatal anaphylaxis . Thus instead of inducing tolerance ( prophylaxis ) , when lethal responses resulted from previously tolerated doses , he coined the word a ( without ) phylaxis ( protection ) . Ana means " against " in Ancient Greek , but ( as stated above ) the word was changed for sound . He was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on anaphylaxis in 1913 . The phenomenon itself however has been described since ancient times . The term comes from the Greek words ἀνά , ana , " against " , and <unk> , phylaxis , " protection " . 
 = = Research = = 
 There are ongoing efforts to develop sublingual epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis . Subcutaneous injection of the anti @-@ IgE antibody <unk> is being studied as a method of preventing recurrence , but it is not yet recommended . 
 = St. Joseph Valley Parkway = 
 The St. Joseph Valley Parkway is a freeway in the U.S. states of Indiana and Michigan , serving as a bypass route around Elkhart , Mishawaka , and South Bend in Indiana and Niles in Michigan . The freeway runs to the south and west of Elkhart and South Bend and Niles and consists of segments of U.S. Route 31 ( US 31 ) and US 20 ; those two highway designations run concurrently at the southwestern rim of the South Bend metropolitan area . It continues north to run along the St. Joseph River valley . 
 The freeway was first built in Indiana in the 1960s , although plans in Michigan date back to the 1950s . Indiana completed its portion of the freeway in 1998 , while Michigan has opened its last segment in 2003 . Further plans , if completed , would extend the freeway from the current end to the north . The ultimate end will either be at the interchange between Interstate 196 ( I @-@ 196 ) and I @-@ 94 as originally planned , or another interchange immediately to the southwest . Environmental and other issues have forced a re @-@ evaluation of the original 1981 plans for the northern end of the freeway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The Parkway begins where US 20 expands to a divided highway southeast of Elkhart . To the east in Indiana the freeway feeds into an undivided segment of US 20 at County Road 17 ( CR 17 ) . From there it runs westward along the south sides of Elkhart and Mishawaka . South of South Bend , US 31 joins the Parkway , and then the Parkway turns northward along the west side of South Bend . Along this segment , US 20 turns back west and leaves the Parkway . The Parkway meets the Indiana Toll Road which carries I @-@ 80 / I @-@ 90 before crossing the state line into Michigan . West of Niles , the Parkway meets US 12 and continues northwesterly running west of Berrien Springs . From there it runs northward to end at Napier Avenue east of St. Joseph . The St. Joseph Valley Parkway ends at Napier Avenue , but US 31 continues as a five @-@ lane highway west along Napier to connect with I @-@ 94 and the rest of the US 31 routing north of there on I @-@ 196 . 
 The Indiana Department of Transportation ( INDOT ) and the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) both maintain the sections of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway in their respective states . Additionally , both departments have listed their freeway segments as part of the National Highway System , a system of roads important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . The two departments conduct surveys to measure the traffic levels along their roadways . This measurement is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) which is a calculation of the traffic volume on a stretch of roadway for any average day of the year . INDOT 's figures for 2007 showed that 30 @,@ 753 vehicles used the freeway near its western end . The traffic volume drops to 19 @,@ 914 vehicles near the Indiana Toll Road . In Michigan , the levels drop as low as 7 @,@ 402 vehicles near the Napier Road interchange .

 = = = Name = = = 
 The " St. Joseph Valley Parkway " name was chosen by local chambers of commerce in the fall of 1992 as the result of a local contest held by a group of local businesses . The name was officially adopted by Michigan in 1993 ( dedicated late 1995 ) and Indiana in 1995 ( dedicated in mid @-@ 1995 ) . 
 = = = Indiana section = = = 
 The first section of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway was completed between US 20 and State Road 2 ( SR 2 ) by 1962 . The freeway was extended to SR 23 and construction was started to extend it further to US 31 . The freeway was given the Bypass US 20 ( BYP US 20 ) designation at this time as well . This extension to US 31 was completed in the mid @-@ 1970s . The exit with the Indiana East – West Toll Road / I @-@ 80 / I @-@ 90 was finished in 1979 . The BYP US 20 designation was replaced by the US 31 designation in 1982 . Construction in the early 1990s extended the freeway in sections from US 31 / Business US 31 ( Bus . US 31 ) to its current end with US 20 at CR 17 , with the portion from US 31 / Bus . US 31 to SR 331 ( Bremen Highway ) paved first , by 1991 . Ramps from <unk> Parkway were completed in 1998 , and the portion in Elkhart was also named the " Dean R. Mock Expressway " in March 2002 . 
 = = = Michigan section = = = 
 A plan to relocate US 31 in Berrien County , Michigan , existed as early as 1952 . Planning to extend the South Bend Bypass northward into Michigan as a bypass of Niles began in 1967 . A report issued in 1970 detailed four routing corridors , spawning a lawsuit over how Berrien Springs would be bypassed . Construction was to begin in 1975 , but the Michigan State Highways Department delayed construction plans in 1972 , pushing the start to 1977 . The first section was completed in 1979 and ran from the state line north to US 12 . From there , US 31 was routed east along US 12 to Bus . US 12 and north along Bus . US 12 to the former routing of US 31 / US 33 . Final plans for the routing north to I @-@ 94 were approved in 1981 . Construction of the Niles Bypass was finished in 1987 , bringing the freeway north to Walton Road northwest of Niles . Bus . US 31 was created along the former routing in Niles and Walton Road was rebuilt as a state trunkline connection between the northern end of the freeway and the former two @-@ lane routing of US 31 . The Berrien Springs Bypass was opened in late 1992 . Since then , MDOT built a 9 @.@ 1 @-@ mile ( 14 @.@ 6 km ) freeway segment north to Napier Avenue that was opened on August 27 , 2003 at a cost of $ 97 million ( equivalent to $ 137 million in 2015 ) . 
 = = Future = = 
 East of Benton Harbor , Michigan , the St. Joseph Valley Parkway extension was under study due to environmental , economical and historical site issues . One of the environmental concerns relates to the habitat of an endangered species , the Mitchell 's Satyr butterfly that has its habitat in the area of the freeway extension . The 40 @-@ acre ( 16 ha ) habitat is home to the second @-@ largest population of the rare butterfly . This freeway connection was originally approved in 1981 as part of a final environmental impact study that included the freeway built from Niles northward to Napier Avenue . Since that approval , the butterfly was discovered in the Blue Creek Fen in the late 1980s , and it was listed an endangered species in 1992 . The listing stalled construction of the freeway north of Berrien Springs . The US Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) issued an opinion two years later that the freeway project would jeopardize the species . MDOT was given permission to modify the previously approved freeway to cross the Blue Creek on longer bridges ; the USFWS also required that any construction be done from elevated platforms , among other restrictions . In the interim , MDOT proceeded with construction of the southern portion of the last freeway segment , completing the freeway northward from Berrien Springs to the Napier Avenue interchange in August 2003 . 
 A revised environmental impact study to account for the butterfly 's habitat was approved in 2004 . The study compared the original proposal for this extension that involved connecting directly to I @-@ 196 at I @-@ 94 with a pair of alternate routines that involved connecting US 31 directly to BL I @-@ 94 at I @-@ 94 near Benton Harbor with auxiliary lanes to I @-@ 196 . The recommendation was to use the PA @-@ 2 version of the alternative connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen . At the time the last freeway segment was opened in 2003 , MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete , but funding was not available for many years . Construction of the extension was not included for this reason in subsequent MDOT five @-@ year highway projects plans , although most of the design work and land acquisition was identified in 2013 as having been finished . Funding for the project was listed in the 2017 – 21 plan draft released in July 2016 , which split the remaining work into three phases . Until the freeway is complete , US 31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue , which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point , westward to I @-@ 94 . The US 31 / I @-@ 94 / BL I @-@ 94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange if a connection is completed in the future , and the St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section .

 = Caroline Street ( Key West ) = 
 Caroline Street is an iconic and historically significant local road on the island of Key West , Florida . It extends approximately 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) northeastward to Grinnell Street from Whitehead Street at its southwest end . One of the oldest roads on the island , Caroline Street is surrounded by many old houses , inns , and historic landmarks , which are known for their seclusion from the street by dense landscaping . From its mostly residential origins between Whitehead and Elizabeth streets , Caroline becomes more commercial , punctuated by numerous businesses . Situated within the historic " Old Town " district , Caroline Street was part of the original infrastructural layout of the island at the time of its 1829 mapping by William Whitehead . Other than changes to both its termini , the majority of its route has remained unaltered since then . Caroline Street was named for a sibling of Whitehead ; his brother , John , became interested in the island after a shipwreck left him stranded in 1819 . The street and some of its surrounding area have been subject to long @-@ term improvement and beautification efforts , beginning chiefly in 1996 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 At its southwesternmost point , Caroline Street begins on Whitehead Street at the Presidential Gates to the Truman Annex , the site of a former naval base that opened to the public in 1986 . Caroline Street 's terminus on Whitehead is two blocks away from the southern terminus of U.S. Route 1 . Between Whitehead and Telegraph Lane just a few hundred feet to the northeast , Caroline is a quiet , shaded street , before its left ( northern ) side opens up to a strip of businesses and shops . The road reaches its first major junction at Duval Street , yielding a largely commercialized zone ; The Bull and Whistle Bar is situated at this intersection . However , upon leaving Duval , Caroline Street returns almost immediately to a chiefly residential road . Homes along this stretch of Caroline are noted for their architectural significance , representing a late @-@ 19th century " conch style " that incorporates elements of several more prominent styles , including Victorian and Colonial . Although many of these houses were constructed quickly and cheaply , their builders employed the same techniques that were used at the time to craft boats , lending them resistance to extreme weather . Described as " stately " , their lots are heavily landscaped , leaving several secluded . 
 The only interruption of this residential stretch is a minor junction with one @-@ way Ann Street , which terminates at Caroline with little fanfare . Further northeast , Caroline intersects Simonton Street to a less commercial degree than Duval . Another block of shaded residences follows before an intersection with Elizabeth Street about midway between Caroline 's termini . Elizabeth serves as a sort of transition point for Caroline , which becomes lined with small shops as it meets Peacock Lane ; Peacock is a one @-@ way street that approaches from the south . As Caroline continues toward the northeast , it crosses William Street and offers an obscured view of the Gulf of Mexico side of the island and vessels at port . Here , the road 's " homely marine practicality " becomes evident , according to a Florida travel writer . 
 Between William and Margaret Street , Caroline passes numerous restaurants and parking for the Key West Bight , which remains visible and can also be accessed by bearing left on Margaret . At the junction of the two roads are several stores and the starting point of the Conch Tour Train . The final several hundred feet of Caroline Street are uneventful , limited to the backdrop of a few houses and businesses . Paralleling the Bight , Caroline comes to an end at Grinnell Street , having traveled almost exactly 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) . 
 = = History and culture = = 
 Caroline Street is situated along the northwestern side of the island , in an historic district known as Old Town Key West . Part of the district , roughly defined as the area between Caroline Street and Angela Streets ( which run parallel about four blocks apart ) , harbors many old houses , some of which belonged to famous writers and other influential persons . For example , the Dr. Joseph Y. Porter House at 429 Caroline Street was home to the first public health inspector in the state of Florida . The Porter House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 . Many of the houses in the area have been converted into inns ; the Curry Mansion Inn at the corner of Caroline and Ann streets was originally built in 1855 for the Currys , a prominent local family . At Caroline Street 's southern terminus across from the Presidential Gates is the Airways Building , which served as the original Pan American World Airways office during its formation in 1927 . 
 Caroline Street , along with Margaret , William , Thomas , and Emma streets , were named for siblings of John Whitehead , who — in 1819 — became stranded on Key West after a shipwreck and took note of the island 's strategic geography . Whitehead 's brother , William , surveyed the city of Key West in 1829 . The original map from William Whitehead 's survey shows the northwestern corner of the island , bounded by present @-@ day Angela Street , designated as " town plot " . This plot was the only part of the island which had a grid @-@ like pattern of streets : five running southwest to northeast , including the path of Caroline Street , at least a dozen oriented from southeast to northwest , and Front Street , which borders the extreme northwestern coast of the island . Therefore , Caroline was cleared by 1829 at the latest , making it among the oldest streets in either the city or the island of Key West . When it received its name , however , is unclear . 
 Currently , Caroline never reaches water at either ends . The 1829 map , however , shows it accessing the Gulf of Mexico at both termini . Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead , it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore . This is confirmed by a map of the island from the early 1900s , which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end . Eventually , the street was excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex , and disconnected from the water at its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City Electric Power Plant on new land . 
 Since 1996 , the upper Caroline Street corridor and Key West Bight have been part of ongoing improvement efforts spearheaded by the City of Key West and funded by a special property tax system . At the beginning of the project , the area , once dominated by commercial fishing , had been falling into disarray as its practical future became uncertain . The dynamics of the project changed throughout its course ; in early 2011 , the city approved spending for specific updates to infrastructure along the corridor , including improved lighting and signs , a more extensive sidewalk system , and versatility with regard to bicycle and pedestrian traffic . As recently as February 2012 , additional requests for improvements were lodged with $ 720 @,@ 000 available for the project .

 = Łódź insurrection ( 1905 ) = 
 The Łódź insurrection , also known as the June Days , was an uprising by Polish workers in Łódź against the Russian Empire between 21 – 25 June 1905 . This event was one of the largest disturbances in the Russian @-@ controlled Congress Poland during the Russian Revolution of 1905 . Poland was a major center of revolutionary fighting in the Russian Empire in 1905 – 1907 , and the Łódź insurrection was a key incident in those events . 
 For months , workers in Łódź had been in a state of unrest , with several major strikes having taken place , which were forcibly suppressed by the Russian police and military . The insurrection began spontaneously , without backing from any organized group . Polish revolutionary groups were taken by surprise and did not play a major role in the subsequent events . Around 21 – 22 June , following clashes with the authorities in the previous days , angry workers began building barricades and assaulting police and military patrols . Additional troops were called by the authorities , who also declared martial law . On 23 June , no businesses operated in the city , as the police and military stormed dozens of workers ' barricades . Eventually , by 25 June , the uprising was crushed , with estimates of several hundred dead and wounded . The uprising was reported in the international press and widely discussed by socialist and communist activists worldwide . Unrest in Łódź would continue for many months , although without protests on such a large @-@ scale as before . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the beginning of the 20th century , worsening economic conditions contributed to mounting tensions in Russia and Poland : the Russo @-@ Japanese War had damaged the economy of the Kingdom of Poland , and by late 1904 , over 100 @,@ 000 Polish workers had lost their jobs . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Łódź had been a major Polish industrial center , heavily urbanized and industrialized , and its large working class made it an important stronghold of the Polish socialist movement . News of the 1905 Russian revolution , together with its revolutionary spirit , spread quickly into Russian @-@ controlled Poland from Saint Petersburg , where demonstrators had been massacred on 22 January . Poland was a major center of revolutionary fighting in the Russian Empire in 1905 – 1907 , and the Łódź insurrection was a key incident in those events . Workers in Łódź had already begun striking sometime before 22 January , and by 31 January the tsarist police were reporting demonstrators carrying placards with slogans such as " Down with the autocracy ! Down with the war ! " . This was capitalized on by factions in Russia and Poland that wanted more or less radical changes . Soon over 400 @,@ 000 workers became involved in strikes in Poland . 
 The wing of the Polish Socialist Party ( Polska Partia <unk> , PPS ) that was loyal to Józef Piłsudski believed that Poles should show their determination to regain independence through active , violent protests against the Russians . This view was not shared by Roman Dmowski 's National Democratic Party ( ND , Polish : endecja ) nor by the PPS 's own " Left " ( or " Young " ) wing . The National Democrats favored cooperation with the Russian authorities , while the PPS Left wanted to work together with Russian revolutionaries to topple the <unk> and saw the creation of a socialist utopia as more important than Polish independence . 
 The Russo @-@ Japanese War had caused rising dissent throughout the Russian Empire , including its Polish provinces . On 26 January 1905 about 6 @,@ 000 workers in Łódź took part in a large strike . Next day , a general strike was declared , and the day after that , 70 @,@ 000 workers were on strike . They demanded an 8 @-@ hour work day and support for the sick . Some worker demonstrations were joined by the students , who demanded an end to the policy of Russification . Another large strike occurred during the Labor Day on 1 May . It affected close to half of the city 's industry . On 3 May , the anniversary of the Polish May Constitution , another demonstration with patriotic undertones took place . On 30 May , Łódź 's industrialists asked the Russian governor @-@ general for help . 
 The murder of the worker Jerzy <unk> by Russian Cossack cavalry at the <unk> is mentioned as one of the sparks of the insurrection . On 18 June 1905 , Russian police opened fire on one of the many workers ' demonstrations in Łódź , killing approximately ten workers , whose funerals , attended by over 50 @,@ 000 – 70 @,@ 000 people , escalated into major demonstrations on 20 and 21 June . The funeral on 21 June was met by Cossack cavalry again ; the crowd threw stones , and the Russian cavalry returned fire , killing 25 people and wounding hundreds . Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania ( SDKPiL ) called for a general strike on 23 June . 
 Piłsudski 's PPS , while not planning for a major uprising then and there , had a policy of supporting the protest and harassing Russian forces . The PPS , as well as other socialist organizations , such as Jewish Bund and SDKPiL , were as surprised by the scale of the spontaneous revolt as the Russian authorities ; PPS forces in Łódź consisted of 10 regular and armed PPS members and a few dozen semi @-@ enlisted workers . A larger group sent from Warsaw under Walery Sławek never made it in time to take control or affect the uprising ; it was , in the end , an anarchic and unorganized violent protest against the Russian government . 
 = = Uprising = = 
 Tensions mounted further , and in the evening of 21 or 22 June ( sources vary ) , angry workers began building barricades and assaulting police and military patrols , killing those who did not surrender . About a hundred barricades were constructed over the course of the next few days . 
 Around Wschodnia street , workers opened fire on a company of soldiers and cavalry , and on <unk> street , a unit of gendarmes was surrounded . Several fires begun in the town , as workers set liquor stores on fire , and the government forces assaulted the first barricades , initially without much success . The tsarist representatives called from reinforcements , which came from Częstochowa , Warsaw , and summer training camps . Several infantry regiments entered the city . Eventually , Russian forces sent to suppress the workers numbered six infantry regiments and several cavalry regiments . Despite that , the situation was spiralling into a full blown uprising . On 23 June , all industries , workshops , shops and offices were closed , as the workers and government forces clashed . 
 Some of the heaviest fighting took place near the intersection of Wschodnia and <unk> ( now <unk> 1905 r . ) streets ( where four barricades were located ) , near the <unk> factory in the Źródliska park and on the <unk> road ( al . <unk> ) . The <unk> area was manned by a 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong worker militia , which eventually was forced to retreat to the Źródliska park . The insurgents had no organized agenda , and commonly fought under red standards ; common demands were the improvement of workers ' living conditions and greater rights for the Polish population . On 23 June ( or as late as 26 June – sources vary ) the Tsar signed a decree of martial law in the city . 
 The PPS @-@ supported worker factions found themselves facing not only Russian police and regular troops , but endecja militia . Armed clashes broke out between gunmen loyal to Piłsudski 's PPS and those loyal to Dmowski . Over the course of the " June Days " , as the Łódź uprising became known in Poland , a miniature civil war raged between Piłsudski 's PPS and Dmowski 's <unk> . 
 The insurgents were poorly armed , and eventually were overwhelmed by the tsarist regular military . Most of the barricades fell by 24 June ; the last of the barricades ( in the Źródliska park and Wschodnia street ) were captured by Russian troops by the end of 24 June or by midday on 25 June ( sources vary ) , but unrest — including occasional shots at police or military patrols — would continue for days afterwards .

 The uprising was ultimately crushed by the Russian authorities . Official reports indicated 151 civilian deaths ( 55 Poles , 79 Jews and 17 Germans ) and 150 wounded ; unofficial reports spoke of over 200 fatalities and between 800 and as many as 2 @,@ 000 wounded . 
 The Łódź uprising was neither the first nor the last disturbance in what has been described in Polish historiography as the revolution in the Kingdom of Poland ( 1905 – 1907 ) — various protests and strikes occurred in major Polish cities under Russian control throughout the year — but it would be the most dramatic one . In September 1905 , two PPS activists would assassinate Juliusz Karol <unk> , owner of the <unk> & <unk> factory , known for his poor treatment of workers . Strikes in Łódź continued until mid @-@ 1906 , when the large Russian military presence and mass layoffs of striking workers from the factories finally pacified the city . Even afterward , Łódź was not a peaceful city ; in the years 1910 – 1914 it was the site of a radical , anarchist and socialist group <unk> <unk> labeled as " the most extreme , terrorist group in the history of Poland " . 
 The uprising was reported in the international press and recognized by socialist and communist activists worldwide .
