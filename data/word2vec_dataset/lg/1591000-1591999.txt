 The German forces in the Netherlands ( under the overall command of Generaloberst Johannes Blaskowitz ) had recently been re @-@ designated Fortress Holland ( German : Festung Holland ) , although this name change had little effect on the units on the ground . The rout of forces the previous year , the formation of ad hoc Kampfgruppe ( Battle Groups ) and <unk> of units made it difficult for Allied intelligence to determine German strength north of the Rhine , and still did several years after the war . Approximately 10 @,@ 000 troops of the 30th German Corps were believed to be in the Arnhem – Apeldoorn area , under the command of General Philipp <unk> . There were believed to be up to 1 @,@ 000 men of the 346th Infantry Division , the 858th Grenadier Regiment and other miscellaneous units occupying the Arnhem area , including a divisional battle school , paratroopers and Dutch @-@ SS . As well as the natural defence provided by the rivers and the high ground north and west of the city , Arnhem itself had been turned into a strong defensive position after the battle the previous year . On the very day of the opening assault on Arnhem , Heinrich Himmler issued a decree that all cities should be defended at any price , failure to do so being punishable by death . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On 11 April , II Corps launched Operation <unk> – the crossing of the IJssel further north at Deventer – prior to striking west toward Apeldoorn . On the morning of 12 April Foulkes was informed that the operation was well underway , whereupon he ordered the 49th Division to commence their attack that evening . The whole day was spent bombarding the enemy in Arnhem using artillery and ground attack aircraft . The RAF laid on 36 Spitfire and 83 rocket firing Typhoon sorties to soften up the German positions and the attack was preceded by one of the heaviest artillery barrages ever fired by I Canadian Corps . One field gun battery of eight guns fired 640 rounds in ten minutes ( an average rate of eight rounds per gun per minute ) , and the Pioneer Corps fired 30 @,@ 000 smoke shells over the course of the battle . A diversionary barrage from south of the Nederrijn provoked a strong German response suggesting they had probably prepared for an attack to be made from the south rather than the east . 
 = = = Phase one = = = 
 The initial assault did not proceed entirely to plan . The crossing was set to begin at 10 : 40pm but was delayed by the late arrival of several assault craft . Additionally several explosive charges on the eastern bank of the river designed to clear a path through landmines and the ' bund ' failed to detonate . The 2nd Battalion The Gloucestershire Regiment then discovered several Buffaloes were inoperative and so the companies were forced to cross separately and not in one assault as planned . Despite this the four companies of 2nd Battalion began crossing separately , their way illuminated by Monty 's moonlight ( searchlights reflecting their light off the clouds overhead ) and Bofors guns firing coloured tracer in the direction of attack . Under the cover of heavy machine guns and mortars the first company reached the west bank of the IJssel at <unk> They began to take their objectives in the face of light opposition along the riverbank , sustaining 32 casualties . After a slight delay they secured the landing area for the prefabricated Bailey bridge and at <unk> The Royal Canadian Engineers began floating the components of the bridge into position . The second wave ; the 2nd Battalion The South Wales Borderers crossed the river under heavy artillery fire . Their assault craft drifted downstream in the crossing , but once ashore they advanced rapidly into the city . However their advance stalled and the 1 / 7th Battalion , Duke of Wellington 's Regiment , originally due to cross in Phase 3 , was sent over the river to support them . By 7 : 00am the 2nd Battalion The Essex Regiment were across the river and by 8 : <unk> the RCE had set up a pontoon ferry to begin moving tanks of the Ontario Regiment across as well . 
 = = = Phase two = = = 
 The Royal Canadian Engineers continued assembling the Bailey bridge throughout the night and 12 hours after H @-@ Hour , traffic was rolling across the IJssel . This allowed Phase 2 of the operation to proceed and soon troops of 146th Brigade and tanks of the Ontario Regiment were moving up to 56th Brigade 's positions . There was relatively little resistance in the morning , although the South Wales Borderers had to beat back a counterattack near the Railway Junction . In the late morning the British advanced towards a large <unk> BV factory complex in the eastern area of the city where a battalion of the 346th Infantry and troops of the 46th <unk> Machine Gun Battalion had set up a strong point . The Germans had moved in from Oosterbeek that morning and had thus escaped the earlier bombardments . The 4th Battalion The Lincolnshire Regiment were tasked to clear the complex , although the Germans – being relatively fresh – were able to offer some resistance . With support from the tanks of the Ontario Regiment , and the 79th Division the Germans were eventually overwhelmed in a battle which lasted most of the day . By the evening of 13 April most of the resistance in the city had broken and the 147th Brigade were preparing to cross into Arnhem . 
 = = = Phase three = = = 
 The 147th Brigade crossed the Nederrijn from the Island overnight and by the morning of the 14 April they were ready to move through 56th Brigade 's positions . By now the German defence was crumbling , but the battalions of the 147th encountered significant numbers of mines and demolitions as they advanced . D Company of the Duke of Wellington 's Regiment ambushed what they believed to be a German counterattack led by three French Renault tanks , although it later transpired that the Germans had no idea that the British were there . Later in the day , Dutch soldiers of the 34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Landstorm Nederland supported by armour counterattacked the Duke of Wellington 's positions . The Dutch were eventually beaten back after heavy fighting knocked out their tanks , but were able to blunt a later British advance into their area . By the end of the day the Allied units had reached all of their objectives and most of Arnhem was secure . The 5th Armoured Division began moving onto the high ground north of the city that night , where they met elements of SAS units who had been operating behind enemy lines since earlier that month . On 15 April the Duke of Wellingtons occupied the city 's zoo and upon discovering a live polar bear offered it to their brigade commander , who declined . The Germans were cleared out of the precinct of <unk> and the surrounding area on 15 and 16 April , bringing Operation Anger to an end . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Allies liberated a ruined city . After the looting the previous year , houses were little more than empty wrecks – devoid of furniture , household goods and even doors . Canadian Broadcasting Corporation correspondent Matthew Halton described the city as " a deserted , burning shell " and the 49th Division war diary noted that " a town had never been more wantonly destroyed . " Evidence of the first battle of Arnhem lay everywhere and the liberation was likened to " entering an ancient tomb . " 
 The Allied advance continued immediately . The 5th Canadian ( Armoured ) Division began moving through Arnhem towards the high ground north of the city on the night of the 14 – 15 April . In a change to the original plan to head west , the division was given a new mission known as Operation <unk> and moved north to secure towns between Arnhem and the IJsselmeer . A large German force counterattacked the 5th Division on the night of the 16th at Otterlo , hoping to break out to the West , but were beaten back after heavy losses . On 17 April the 49th Division attacked Ede , occupied by the Dutch SS , and liberated the town in 24 hours . On 27 April a temporary truce came into effect , allowing the distribution of food aid to the starving Dutch civilians in areas under German control ( Operation Manna ) , and on 5 May Generaloberst Blaskowitz agreed to the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the Netherlands . 
 The British recorded 62 killed and 134 wounded in the action , although it is unclear if this includes Canadian casualties . German figures are imprecise with prisoners of war being recorded as 601 in some sources and up to 1 @,@ 600 in others . Casualties are similarly unknown , although could have been as high as 3 @,@ 000 . Most of the Allied men killed in the battle were buried at the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery after the war , whilst Germans who had been buried at localised cemeteries or in field graves were eventually re @-@ interred at Ysselsteyn , along with most Germans killed in the Netherlands . Units involved in the battle were later awarded the battle honour Arnhem 1945 . In 1999 the Princess Louise Fusiliers were also granted the honour after research by Captain Sanchez King was able to demonstrate the regiment 's entitlement .

 Turning Point ( 2008 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view ( PPV ) event produced by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) promotion , which took place on November 9 , 2008 at the TNA Impact ! Zone in Orlando , Florida . It was the fourth in the Turning Point chronology and the first under its name to take place in November . It was originally scheduled for December , but TNA moved it to November in late 2008 for an unknown reason . It was the eleventh event in the 2008 TNA PPV schedule . Eight professional wrestling matches , with three involving championships , were featured on the event 's card . 
 The main event was for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship , in which then @-@ champion Sting defeated the challenger A.J. Styles . Kevin Nash versus Samoa Joe was also featured on the card . Nash defeated Joe in the contest . A Falls Count Anywhere match pitting Kurt Angle against Abyss was promoted for the undercard , which Angle won . The TNA Legends Championship was defended for the first time by Booker T against Christian Cage during the show . Booker T was the victor in the bout , thus retaining the championship . 
 30 @,@ 000 was the reported figure of purchasers for the event by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter . Turning Point had an attendance of 1 @,@ 100 people . Bryan and Chris Sokol of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer website rated Turning Point a 7 out of 10 , which was just above the 2007 event 's rating of 6 @.@ 5 . In his review , Phil Allely of the United Kingdom 's The Sun newspaper felt Turning Point was " a thoroughly enjoyable show " .

 On the first day of 2008 , TNA updated their official website to publicize the official dates for all of their PPV events to take place that year . The next installment in the Turning Point chronology was scheduled for December 14 , 2008 . The date was later changed to December 21 , and the location was announced as the TNA Impact ! Zone in Orlando , Florida . In October 2008 , three events were rescheduled : Genesis , Final Resolution , and Turning Point . The first moved was Turning Point to the Genesis event date of November 9 , while Final Resolution was announced for some time in December . Genesis was later announced to be taking place in Charlotte , North Carolina on January 11 , 2009 . The song Indestructible by the rock band Disturbed was used as the official theme of the event . The promotional poster for the gathering , featuring Mick Foley , was released through PPV providers . 
 = = = Storylines = = = 
 Turning Point featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds and storylines . Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or heroes in the scripted events which built tension and culminated with a wrestling match or series of matches . 
 Heading into Turning Point , TNA 's main storyline was an on @-@ screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans , who played the villains and called themselves The Main Event Mafia ( Sting , Kurt Angle , Kevin Nash , Booker T , and Scott Steiner ) , and the younger talent of the company , who played the heroic characters and were led by A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe . Multiple smaller rivalries broke off from this storyline , such as one over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between the reigning champion , Sting , and the challenger , Styles . It began on August 10 at TNA 's Hard Justice PPV event when Sting assaulted Styles after his encounter with Angle . Sting then defeated Joe , an ally of Styles , at TNA 's Bound for Glory IV PPV event on October 12 after an assist from Nash , which later sparked a rivalry between Joe and Nash . Sting 's and Styles ' rivalry soon escalated to a point where storyline co @-@ owner of TNA Mick Foley announced on the October 30 episode of TNA 's television program TNA Impact ! that the two would fight for the championship at Turning Point . 
 The build to the encounter between Joe and Nash began in December 2007 . On December 2 , 2007 at the previous Turning Point event , Joe was scheduled to take part in a Six Man Tag Team match , partnering with Nash and Nash 's longtime real @-@ life friend Scott Hall to face The Angle Alliance ( Angle , Styles , and Tomko ) . Hall , however , missed the event citing " food poisoning " , leaving Joe legitimately angered by the excuse . Joe went on to make an on @-@ camera statement in the ring insulting Hall . Following the incident , TNA began a storyline in which Joe was unhappy with his position in the company for various reasons and had continuous conflicts with Nash . After time , Nash became Joe 's on @-@ screen mentor , which led to Joe defeating Angle on April 13 at TNA 's Lockdown PPV event to become the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion . Joe and Nash 's partnership seemed to come to a close after Nash disappeared from TNA television in mid @-@ 2008 . He returned at Bound for Glory IV where he cost Joe the championship in his match against Sting . On the October 30 episode of Impact ! , Foley announced that Joe would face Nash at Turning Point . 
 Another bout advertised for the event was Angle versus Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match . At Bound for Glory IV , Angle lost to TNA founder and on @-@ screen co @-@ owner Jeff Jarrett with Foley as Special Guest Enforcer . On the Impact ! after Bound for Glory IV , Angle challenged Jarrett to another match at Turning Point , however , Jarrett refused . Angered by Jarrett 's refusal , Angle began assaulting several wrestlers in TNA to persuade Jarrett into accepting the challenge . On the October 23 episode of Impact ! , Angle challenged Jarrett again to a rematch , which Jarrett again refused . Jarrett , however , recommended Abyss as Angle 's opponent , who was a casualty of Angle 's attacks the previous week . On the October 30 episode of Impact ! , Angle fought Abyss in a contest which ended in a disqualification after Angle struck Abyss with a steel chair . Following their encounter , a match was promoted pitting Angle against Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Turning Point . 
 On the October 23 episode of Impact ! , Booker T introduced a new championship named the TNA Legends Championship and declared himself the inaugural champion . Afterwards , Christian Cage , who had remained neutral in the storyline , entered the arena and challenged Booker T to defend the championship against him at Turning Point . Booker T accepted after he added the stipulation that if Cage lost the encounter he would have to join The Main Event Mafia . Later on the October 30 episode of Impact ! , the match was made official when it was promoted for the event .

 The event featured employees other than the wrestlers involved in the matches . There were four overall commentators for the event ; Mike Tenay and Don West provided English commentary , while Hector Guerrero and Willie Urbina served as the Spanish announce team . There were three ring announcers for the spectacle as the normal ring announcer , David Penzer , was used for all but two contests . Retired Army veteran Sean M. Autrey served as the special guest ring announcer for the Rhino and Sheik Abdul Bashir encounter . Jeremy Borash announced the competitors for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match , using a style similar to professional boxing as made famous by Michael Buffer . Shane Sewell , Earl Hebner , Rudy Charles , Mark " Slick " Johnson , and Andrew Thomas participated as referees for the encounters . Borash and Lauren Thompson were used as interviewers throughout the event . Besides wrestlers who were appearing in a wrestling role , Jeff Jarrett , Mick Foley , Scott Steiner , and Matt Morgan were also featured in backstage segments . Other than contractual employees being featured , the group Insane Clown Posse ( ICP ) and Scott Hall were seen in attendance . This was later revealed to have been scripted to occur , as TNA had asked ICP to attend the event , but were unaware of Hall being their guest . 
 = = = Preliminary matches = = = 
 The event commenced with a ten @-@ man X Division elimination rankings match , which involved Eric Young , Consequences Creed , Doug Williams , Homicide , Jay Lethal , Jimmy Rave , Petey Williams , Sonjay Dutt , Tanahashi , and Volador . The match was announced as following lucha libre tag team rules , in which a participant could be replaced if thrown from the ring to the floor , but not eliminated from the match unless by pinfall or submission . The order of elimination determined the standings in the X Division towards a future TNA X Division Championship match , in storyline . Homicide was injured during the match , thus was declared eliminated after a bad fall to the outside area . Lethal and Young were the final two men in the contest . Young was the victor in the match after slamming Lethal into the mat with a bridging back suplex at 17 minutes . 
 A tag team match pitting the team of Roxxi and Taylor Wilde against the team of Awesome Kong and Raisha Saeed , who were accompanied by Rhaka Khan , was held . After various maneuvers were performed by each competitor , Wilde gained the pinfall victory on Saeed after forcing her back into the mat with a bridging German suplex at eight minutes . 
 Rhino fought Sheik Abdul Bashir in the following bout . Ten year Army veteran Sean M. Autrey served as the special guest ring announcer for the encounter . The match lasted nine minutes , and came to a finish when Rhino pinned Bashir after a tackle . 
 The TNA World Tag Team Championship was contested between the reigning champions Beer Money , Inc . ( James Storm and Robert Roode ) , who were accompanied by Jacqueline , and The Motor City <unk> of Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin . After several tag team maneuvers from both teams , Storm spat beer in Sabin 's face , blinding him . This allowed Beer Money to lift up and slam Sabin back @-@ first to the mat with their Drinking While Investing ( DWI ) tag team maneuver to gain the pinfall and retain the championship at 17 minutes .

 The fifth match was Booker T 's defense of the TNA Legends Championship against Christian Cage , with the added stipulation that if Cage lost , he would be forced to join The Main Event Mafia . Booker T was accompanied by Sharmell for the bout . The match lasted for 11 minutes , ending when Booker T pinned Cage with a roll @-@ up . 
 A Falls Count Anywhere match between Kurt Angle and Abyss followed , lasting 17 minutes . At one point during the encounter while Abyss was standing on the concrete floor and Angle was on the stage , Angle performed a running leap off the stage into a somersault senton , connecting with Abyss on the floor . Angle was the victor in the bout , after throwing Abyss off of a scaffold through the Spanish announcers ' table , then descending and covering Abyss for the pinfall . 
 Kevin Nash fought Samoa Joe in the seventh contest of the night . The match lasted 12 minutes . At two points during the match , Nash performed his signature Jackknife Powerbomb with Joe kicking out before the three count . This led to Nash hitting Joe in the groin and placing his feet on the ropes for leverage in his winning pin attempt . 
 The main event was for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion , Sting , and the challenger , A.J. Styles . During the 15 minutes the match lasted , Styles executed his aerial technique the Spiral Tap , in which he jumps off one of the top padded turnbuckles , spins and flips in mid @-@ air before landing on his opponent . He then ascended the turnbuckle to perform the maneuver once again , but was distracted by Angle and Booker T. Later , Styles missed a pele kick on Sting , which allowed Sting to counter with a small package pin on Styles to retain the championship .

 On the November 13 episode of Impact ! , Cage was to be inducted into The Main Event Mafia ( MEM ) , however , they instead turned on and assaulted him . This led to Cage 's occasional tag team partner , Rhino , becoming involved in the overall storyline as the leader of the group The TNA Front Line after he was attacked by MEM on the November 20 episode of Impact ! . During that same telecast , Angle versus Rhino was announced as TNA 's Final Resolution event , with the added stipulations that if Angle won he would gain an opportunity to face Jeff Jarrett , while if Rhino won , then Angle was to be released from his TNA contract . Angle went on to defeat Rhino at the event , which led to Angle defeating Jarrett in a No Disqualification match at TNA 's Genesis event in January 2009 . 
 Sting and Styles went on to have another match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Final Resolution . This time , the team of Sting , Steiner , Nash , and Booker T faced off against Styles , Joe , and two mystery partners ( The TNA Front Line ) in an Eight Man Tag Team match . The stipulations were if anyone from Styles ' team pinned a member of Sting 's team , then Styles won the TNA Title , while if anyone from Sting 's team pinned a member of Styles ' team , then Sting retained the title . The match was announced on the November 20 episode of Impact ! . Styles ' mystery partners were revealed on the November 27 episode of Impact ! as Team 3D ( Brother Devon and Brother Ray ) . Sting went on to retain the title at Final Resolution after he pinned Joe . 
 Eric Young got his TNA X Division Championship match on the November 13 episode of Impact ! against then @-@ champion Sheik Abdul Bashir . Though he defeated him to become the new champion , a week later the decision was reversed and Young was forced to relinquish the title belt to Bashir due to a controversial ending to their match . Young and Bashir fought for the championship once again at Final Resolution , with referee Shane Sewell interfering in the bout like he had done in the previous encounter , which allowed Young to gain the victory . Afterwards , Management Director Jim Cornette stripped Young of the championship . This set up a tournament for the title , ending at Genesis where Alex Shelley defeated Chris Sabin to become the new champion .

 = Niobium = 
 Niobium , formerly columbium , is a chemical element with symbol Nb ( formerly Cb ) and atomic number 41 . It is a soft , grey , ductile transition metal , which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral , the main commercial source for niobium , and columbite . The name comes from Greek mythology : Niobe , daughter of Tantalus since it is so similar to tantalum . 
 Niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum , and the two are difficult to distinguish . The English chemist Charles Hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium . In 1809 , the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical . The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element , which he named niobium . In 1864 and 1865 , a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element ( as distinguished from tantalum ) , and for a century both names were used interchangeably . Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949 , but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States . 
 It was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially . Brazil is the leading producer of niobium and <unk> , an alloy of niobium and iron which has a niobium content of 60 @-@ 70 % . Niobium is used mostly in alloys , the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines . Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0 @.@ 1 % , the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel . The temperature stability of niobium @-@ containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines . 
 Niobium is used in various superconducting materials . These superconducting alloys , also containing titanium and tin , are widely used in the superconducting magnets of MRI scanners . Other applications of niobium include welding , nuclear industries , electronics , optics , numismatics , and jewelry . In the last two applications , the low toxicity and iridescence produced by anodization are highly desired properties . 
 = = History = = 
 Niobium was discovered by the English chemist Charles Hatchett in 1801 . He found a new element in a mineral sample that had been sent to England from Massachusetts , United States in 1734 by John Winthrop <unk> ( grandson of John Winthrop the Younger ) and named the mineral columbite and the new element columbium after Columbia , the poetical name for the United States . The columbium discovered by Hatchett was probably a mixture of the new element with tantalum . 
 Subsequently , there was considerable confusion over the difference between columbium ( niobium ) and the closely related tantalum . In 1809 , the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium — columbite , with a density 5 @.@ 918 g / cm3 , and tantalum — tantalite , with a density over 8 g / cm3 , and concluded that the two oxides , despite the significant difference in density , were identical ; thus he kept the name tantalum . This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose , who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample , and named them after children of Tantalus : niobium ( from Niobe ) , and pelopium ( from Pelops ) . This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium . The claimed new elements pelopium , ilmenium and <unk> were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum . 
 The differences between tantalum and niobium were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm <unk> , and Henri Etienne Sainte @-@ Claire Deville , as well as Louis J. Troost , who determined the formulas of some of the compounds in 1865 and finally by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866 , who all proved that there were only two elements . Articles on ilmenium continued to appear until 1871 . 
 De Marignac was the first to prepare the metal in 1864 , when he reduced niobium chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen . Although de Marignac was able to produce tantalum @-@ free niobium on a larger scale by 1866 , it was not until the early 20th century that niobium was used in incandescent lamp filaments , the first commercial application . This use quickly became obsolete through the replacement of niobium with tungsten , which has a higher melting point . That niobium improves the strength of steel was first discovered in the 1920s , and this application remains its predominant use . In 1961 , the American physicist Eugene <unk> and coworkers at Bell Labs discovered that niobium @-@ tin continues to exhibit superconductivity in the presence of strong electric currents and magnetic fields , making it the first material to support the high currents and fields necessary for useful high @-@ power magnets and electrical power machinery . This discovery enabled — two decades later — the production of long multi @-@ strand cables wound into coils to create large , powerful electromagnets for rotating machinery , particle accelerators , and particle detectors . 
 = = = Naming the element = = = 
 <unk> ( symbol " Cb " ) was the name originally given to this element by Hatchett , and this name remained in use in American journals — the last paper published by American Chemical Society with columbium in its title dates from 1953 — while niobium was used in Europe . To end this confusion , the name niobium was chosen for element 41 at the 15th Conference of the Union of Chemistry in Amsterdam in 1949 . A year later this name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) after 100 years of controversy , despite the chronological precedence of the name columbium . The latter name is still sometimes used in US industry . This was a compromise of sorts ; the IUPAC accepted tungsten instead of wolfram in deference to North American usage ; and niobium instead of columbium in deference to European usage . Not everyone agreed , and while many leading chemical societies and government organizations use the official IUPAC name , many leading metallurgists , metal societies , and the United States Geological Survey still use the original American name , " columbium " .

 Niobium is a lustrous , grey , ductile , paramagnetic metal in Group 5 of the periodic table ( see table ) , with an electron configuration in the outermost shells atypical for Group 5 . ( This can be observed in the neighborhood of ruthenium ( 44 ) , rhodium ( 45 ) , and palladium ( 46 ) . ) 
 Although it is thought to have a body @-@ centered cubic Crystal structure from T = 0 K to its melting point , high @-@ resolution measurements of the thermal expansion along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are inconsistent with a cubic structure . Therefore , further research and discovery in this area is expected . 
 Niobium becomes a superconductor at cryogenic temperatures . At atmospheric pressure , it has the highest critical temperature of the elemental superconductors : 9 @.@ 2 K. Niobium has the greatest magnetic penetration depth of any element . In addition , it is one of the three elemental Type II superconductors , along with vanadium and technetium . The superconductive properties are strongly dependent on the purity of the niobium metal . 
 When very pure , it is comparatively soft and ductile , but impurities make it harder . 
 The metal has a low capture cross @-@ section for thermal neutrons ; thus it is used in the nuclear industries where neutron transparent structures are desired . 
 = = = Chemical = = = 
 The metal takes on a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room temperature for extended periods . Despite a high melting point in elemental form ( 2 @,@ 468 ° C ) , it has a lower density than other refractory metals . Furthermore , it is corrosion @-@ resistant , exhibits superconductivity properties , and forms dielectric oxide layers . 
 Niobium is slightly less electropositive and more compact than its predecessor in the periodic table , zirconium , whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms , as a result of the lanthanide contraction . As a result , niobium 's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum , which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table . Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum , the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications , such as vat linings in chemical plants . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Niobium in the Earth 's crust comprises one stable isotope , <unk> . By 2003 , at least 32 radioisotopes had been synthesized , ranging in atomic mass from 81 to 113 . The most stable of these is <unk> with a half @-@ life of 34 @.@ 7 million years . One of the least stable is <unk> , with an estimated half @-@ life of 30 milliseconds . Isotopes that are lighter than the stable <unk> tend to decay by β + decay , and those that are heavier tend to decay by β − decay , with some exceptions . <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> have minor β + delayed proton emission decay paths , <unk> decays by electron capture and positron emission , and <unk> decays by both β + and β − decay . 
 At least 25 nuclear isomers have been described , ranging in atomic mass from 84 to 104 . Within this range , only <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> do not have isomers . The most stable of niobium 's isomers is <unk> with a half @-@ life of 16 @.@ 13 years . The least stable isomer is <unk> with a half @-@ life of 103 ns . All of niobium 's isomers decay by isomeric transition or beta decay except <unk> , which has a minor electron capture decay chain . 
 = = = Occurrence = = = 
 Niobium is estimated to be the 34th most common element in the Earth ’ s crust , with 20 ppm . Some think that the abundance on Earth is much greater , and that the element 's high density has concentrated it in the Earth ’ s core . The free element is not found in nature , but niobium occurs in combination with other elements in minerals . Minerals that contain niobium often also contain tantalum . Examples include columbite ( ( Fe , Mn ) ( Nb , Ta ) 2O6 ) and columbite – tantalite ( or coltan , ( Fe , Mn ) ( Ta , Nb ) 2O6 ) . <unk> – tantalite minerals are most usually found as accessory minerals in pegmatite intrusions , and in alkaline intrusive rocks . Less common are the niobates of calcium , uranium , thorium and the rare earth elements . Examples of such niobates are pyrochlore ( ( Na , Ca ) <unk> ( OH , F ) ) and euxenite ( ( Y , Ca , Ce , U , Th ) ( Nb , Ta , Ti ) 2O6 ) . These large deposits of niobium have been found associated with <unk> ( carbonate @-@ silicate igneous rocks ) and as a constituent of pyrochlore . 
 The three largest currently mined deposits of pyrochlore , two in Brazil and one in Canada , were founded in the 1950s , and are still the major producers of niobium mineral concentrates . The largest deposit is hosted within a carbonatite intrusion in <unk> , state of Minas Gerais , Brazil , owned by <unk> ( <unk> Brasileira de <unk> e <unk> ) ; the other active Brazilian deposit is located near <unk> , state of Goiás , and owned by Anglo American plc ( through its subsidiary <unk> <unk> ) , also hosted within a carbonatite intrusion . Together , those two mines produce about 88 % of the world 's supply . Brazil also has a large but still unexploited deposit near São Gabriel da <unk> , state of Amazonas , as well as a few smaller deposits , notably in the state of <unk> . 
 The third largest producer of niobium is the carbonatite @-@ hosted <unk> mine , in Saint @-@ Honoré , near Chicoutimi , Quebec , Canada , owned by Magris Resources . It produces between 7 % and 10 % of the world 's supply .

 After the separation from the other minerals , the mixed oxides of tantalum Ta2O5 and niobium Nb2O5 are obtained . The first step in the processing is the reaction of the oxides with hydrofluoric acid : 
 Ta2O5 + 14 HF → 2 H2 [ TaF7 ] + 5 H2O 
 Nb2O5 + 10 HF → 2 H2 [ NbOF5 ] + 3 H2O 
 The first industrial scale separation , developed by de Marignac , exploits the differing solubilities of the complex niobium and tantalum fluorides , dipotassium <unk> monohydrate ( K2 [ NbOF5 ] · H2O ) and dipotassium heptafluorotantalate ( K2 [ TaF7 ] ) in water . Newer processes use the liquid extraction of the fluorides from aqueous solution by organic solvents like <unk> . The complex niobium and tantalum fluorides are extracted separately from the organic solvent with water and either precipitated by the addition of potassium fluoride to produce a potassium fluoride complex , or precipitated with ammonia as the pentoxide : 
 H2 [ NbOF5 ] + 2 KF → K2 [ NbOF5 ] ↓ + 2 HF 
 Followed by : 
 2 H2 [ NbOF5 ] + 10 NH4OH → Nb2O5 ↓ + 10 NH4F + 7 H2O 
 Several methods are used for the reduction to metallic niobium . The electrolysis of a molten mixture of K2 [ NbOF5 ] and sodium chloride is one ; the other is the reduction of the fluoride with sodium . With this method , a relatively high purity niobium can be obtained . In large scale production , Nb2O5 is reduced with hydrogen or carbon . In the aluminothermic reaction , a mixture of iron oxide and niobium oxide is reacted with aluminium : 
 3 Nb2O5 + Fe2O3 + 12 Al → 6 Nb + 2 Fe + 6 Al2O3 
 Small amounts of oxidizers like sodium nitrate are added to enhance the reaction . The result is aluminium oxide and <unk> , an alloy of iron and niobium used in the steel production . <unk> contains between 60 and 70 % niobium . Without iron oxide , the aluminothermic process is used to produce niobium . Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys . Electron beam melting under vacuum is the method used by the two major distributors of niobium . 
 As of 2013 , <unk> from Brazil controlled 85 percent of the world 's niobium production . The United States Geological Survey estimates that the production increased from 38 @,@ 700 tonnes in 2005 to 44 @,@ 500 tonnes in 2006 . Worldwide resources are estimated to be 4 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 tonnes . During the ten @-@ year period between 1995 and 2005 , the production more than doubled , starting from 17 @,@ 800 tonnes in 1995 . Between 2009 and 2011 production was stable at 63 @,@ 000 tonnes per year , with a slight decrease in 2012 to only 50 @,@ 000 tonnes per year . 
 Lesser amounts are found in Malawi 's <unk> Deposit ( <unk> mine ) .

 In many ways , Niobium is similar to tantalum and zirconium . It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures ; with fluorine at room temperature ; with chlorine and hydrogen at 200 ° C ; and with nitrogen at 400 ° C , with products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric . The metal begins to oxidize in air at 200 ° C. It resists corrosion by fused alkalis and by acids , including aqua regia , hydrochloric , sulfuric , nitric and phosphoric acids . Niobium is attacked by hydrofluoric acid and hydrofluoric / nitric acid mixtures . 
 Although niobium exhibits all of the formal oxidation states from + 5 to − 1 , the most common compounds have niobium in the + 5 state . Characteristically , compounds in oxidation states less than 5 + display Nb – Nb bonding . 
 = = = Oxides and sulfides = = = 
 Niobium forms oxides in the oxidation states + 5 ( Nb2O5 ) , + 4 ( <unk> ) , + 3 ( <unk> ) , and the rarer oxidation state , + 2 ( <unk> ) . Most common is the pentoxide , precursor to almost all niobium compounds and alloys . <unk> are generated by dissolving the pentoxide in basic hydroxide solutions or by melting it in alkali metal oxides . Examples are lithium niobate ( <unk> ) and lanthanum niobate ( <unk> ) . In the lithium niobate is a trigonally distorted perovskite @-@ like structure , whereas the lanthanum niobate contains lone <unk> − 
 4 ions . The layered niobium sulfide ( <unk> ) is also known . 
 Materials can be coated with a thin film of niobium ( V ) oxide chemical vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition processes , produced by the thermal decomposition of niobium ( V ) <unk> above 350 ° C. 
 = = = Halides = = = 
 Niobium forms halides in the oxidation states of + 5 and + 4 as well as diverse <unk> compounds . The pentahalides ( <unk> 
 5 ) feature octahedral Nb centres . Niobium pentafluoride ( <unk> ) is a white solid with a melting point of 79 @.@ 0 ° C and niobium pentachloride ( <unk> ) is yellow ( see image at left ) with a melting point of 203 @.@ 4 ° C. Both are hydrolyzed to give oxides and oxyhalides , such as <unk> . The pentachloride is a versatile reagent used to generate the organometallic compounds , such as <unk> dichloride ( ( C 
 5H 
 5 ) 
 <unk> 
 2 ) . The tetrahalides ( <unk> 
 4 ) are dark @-@ coloured polymers with Nb @-@ Nb bonds ; for example , the black hygroscopic niobium tetrafluoride ( <unk> ) and brown niobium tetrachloride ( <unk> ) . 
 <unk> halide compounds of niobium are well known , owing in part to the Lewis acidity of the pentahalides . The most important is [ <unk> ] 2 − , an intermediate in the separation of Nb and Ta from the ores . This heptafluoride tends to form the <unk> more readily than does the tantalum compound . Other halide complexes include octahedral [ <unk> ] − : 
 <unk> + 2 Cl − → 2 [ <unk> ] − 
 As with other metals with low atomic numbers , a variety of reduced halide cluster ions is known , the prime example being [ <unk> ] 4 − .

 Other binary compounds of niobium include niobium nitride ( <unk> ) , which becomes a superconductor at low temperatures and is used in detectors for infrared light . The main niobium carbide is <unk> , an extremely hard , refractory , ceramic material , commercially used in cutting tool bits .

 Out of 44 @,@ 500 metric tons of niobium mined in 2006 , an estimated 90 % was used in high @-@ grade structural steel . The second largest application is superalloys . Niobium alloy superconductors and electronic components account for a very small share of the world production .

 Niobium is an effective <unk> element for steel , within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride . These compounds improve the grain refining , and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening . These effects in turn increase the toughness , strength , formability , and weldability . Within <unk> stainless steels , the niobium content is a small ( less than 0 @.@ 1 % ) but important addition to high strength low alloy steels that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles . 
 These same niobium alloys are often used in pipeline construction .

 Quantities of niobium are used in <unk> , <unk> , and iron @-@ based superalloys in proportions a great as 6 @.@ 5 % for such applications as jet engine components , gas turbines , rocket subassemblies , turbo charger systems , heat resisting , and combustion equipment . Niobium precipitates a hardening γ ' ' <unk> within the grain structure of the superalloy . 
 One example superalloy is Inconel 718 , consisting of roughly 50 % nickel , 18 @.@ 6 % chromium , 18 @.@ 5 % iron , 5 % niobium , 3 @.@ 1 % molybdenum , 0 @.@ 9 % titanium , and 0 @.@ 4 % aluminium . These superalloys are used , for example , in advanced air frame systems for the Gemini program . Another niobium alloy was used for the nozzle of the Apollo Service Module . Because niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400 ° C , a protective coating is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle .

 C @-@ 103 alloy was developed in the early 1960s jointly by the Wah Chang Corporation and Boeing Co . DuPont , Union Carbide Corp. , General Electric Co. and several other companies were developing Nb @-@ base alloys simultaneously , largely driven by the Cold War and Space Race . It is composed of 89 % niobium , 10 % hafnium and 1 % titanium and is used for liquid rocket thruster nozzles , such as the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules . 
 The reactivity of Nb with oxygen requires it to be worked in a vacuum or inert atmosphere , which significantly increases the cost and difficulty of production . Vacuum arc remelting ( <unk> ) and electron beam melting ( EBM ) , novel processes at the time , enabled the development of niobium and other reactive metals . The project that yielded C @-@ 103 began in 1959 with as many as 256 experimental Nb alloys in the " C @-@ series " ( possibly from columbium ) that could be melted as buttons and rolled into sheet . Wah Chang had an inventory of Hf , refined from nuclear @-@ grade Zr , that it wanted to put to commercial use . The 103rd experimental composition of the C @-@ series alloys , Nb @-@ 10Hf @-@ <unk> , had the best combination of formability and high @-@ temperature properties . Wah Chang fabricated the first 500 @-@ lb heat of C @-@ 103 in 1961 , ingot to sheet , using EBM and <unk> . The intended applications included turbine engines and liquid metal heat exchangers . Competing Nb alloys from that era included <unk> ( Nb @-@ 10W @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ) from <unk> Metallurgical Corp. , <unk> ( Nb @-@ 10W @-@ 10Hf @-@ <unk> ) from Wah Chang and Boeing , <unk> ( Nb @-@ 10W @-@ <unk> ) from Union Carbide , and <unk> from Superior Tube Co .

These superconducting magnets are used in magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance instruments as well as in particle accelerators . For example , the Large Hadron Collider uses 600 tons of superconducting strands , while the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor uses an estimated 600 tonnes of <unk> strands and 250 tonnes of <unk> strands . In 1992 alone , more than US $ 1 billion worth of clinical magnetic resonance imaging systems were constructed with niobium @-@ titanium wire .

 Niobium and some niobium alloys are physiologically inert and hypoallergenic . For this reason , niobium is used in prosthetics and implant devices , such as pacemakers . Niobium treated with sodium hydroxide forms a porous layer that aids osseointegration . 
 Like titanium , tantalum , and aluminium , niobium can be heated and anodized ( " reactive metal anodization " ) to produce a wide array of iridescent colours for jewelry , where its hypoallergenic property is highly desirable .

 Niobium is used as a precious metal in commemorative coins , often with silver or gold . For example , Austria produced a series of silver niobium euro coins starting in 2003 ; the colour in these coins is created by the diffraction of light by a thin anodized oxide layer . In 2012 , ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin : blue , green , brown , purple , violet , or yellow . Two more examples are the 2004 Austrian € 25 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin , and the 2006 Austrian € 25 European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin . The Austrian mint produced for Latvia a similar series of coins starting in 2004 , with one following in 2007 . In 2011 , the Royal Canadian Mint started production of a $ 5 sterling silver and niobium coin named Hunter 's Moon in which the niobium was selectively oxidized , thus creating unique finishes where no two coins are exactly alike .

 The arc @-@ tube seals of high pressure sodium vapor lamps are made from niobium , sometimes alloyed with 1 % of zirconium ; niobium has a very similar coefficient of thermal expansion , matching the sintered alumina arc tube ceramic , a translucent material which resists chemical attack or reduction by the hot liquid sodium and sodium vapour contained inside the operating lamp . 
 Niobium is used in arc welding rods for some stabilized grades of stainless steel and in anodes for cathodic protection systems on some water tanks , which are then usually plated with platinum . 
 Niobium is an important component of high performance heterogeneous catalysts for the production of acrylic acid by selective oxidation of propane .

 Niobium has no known biological role . While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant and a potential fire hazard , elemental niobium on a larger scale is physiologically inert ( and thus hypoallergenic ) and harmless . It is frequently used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants . 
 Niobium @-@ containing compounds are rarely encountered by most people , but some are toxic and should be treated with care . The short- and long @-@ term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride , two chemicals that are water @-@ soluble , have been tested in rats . Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose ( LD50 ) between 10 and 100 mg / kg . For oral administration the toxicity is lower ; a study with rats yielded a LD50 after seven days of 940 mg / kg . 
 = New York State Route 222 = 
 New York State Route 222 ( NY 222 ) is an east – west state highway in central New York in the United States . It runs from an intersection with NY 38 in the village of Groton in northeastern Tompkins County to a junction with the conjoined routes of U.S. Route 11 , NY 13 , and NY 41 in the city of Cortland in western Cortland County . NY 222 passes through the town of Cortlandville , where it intersects NY 281 and serves Cortland County – Chase Field Airport . The road was acquired by the state of New York in the early 20th century and designated NY 222 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 222 begins at an intersection with NY 38 ( Main and Cayuga streets ) in the village of Groton . The route proceeds east along the two @-@ lane East Cortland Street , serving several blocks of homes in the eastern part of the village . It soon exits the village limits , at which point NY 222 changes names to Cortland Road and the residential areas give way to wide stretches of farmland . As the highway runs across the town of Groton , it passes only a handful of houses as it intersects County Route 102 ( CR 102 , named Salt Road ) and CR <unk> ( Champlin Road ) at junctions roughly 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) apart . NY 222 's eastward track continues to a nearby intersection with CR 180 ( Lafayette Road ) , where the route crosses Fall Creek and darts northeastward to run along the base of a large hill . 
 The highway briefly parallels Fall Creek ; however , it soon splits to the southeast at a junction with CR 103 ( Groton City Road ) . From here , NY 222 continues on a generally southeasterly alignment along the base of a rural valley to the Tompkins – Cortland county line . Now in the town of Cortlandville , the route loses the Cortland Road name as it curves eastward to match similar turns in the course of the valley . The highway follows a winding course until the surrounding gully empties into the much wider Tioughnioga River valley , where the route straightens out and intersects with CR 119 ( Sears Road ) . East of this point , NY 222 begins to run northeastward past homes as it approaches Cortland County – Chase Field Airport . The route provides direct access to the airport and subsequently meets NY 281 ( West Road ) at the northeastern tip of the airport property . 
 Past NY 281 , NY 222 crosses a commercial section of Cortlandville , passing several strip malls prior to entering the city of Cortland . Now named Groton Avenue , the route slowly curves eastward while traversing a residential part of the city . It passes north of the State University of New York at Cortland , and the campus marks the western edge of downtown Cortland . NY 222 becomes a commercialized street again , serving a pair of city blocks before intersecting with US 11 and NY 41 ( Main Street ) . US 11 and NY 41 join NY 222 , and the concurrency between the three routes heads east through downtown as Clinton Avenue . The overlap lasts for just one block , however , as NY 222 ends upon intersecting NY 13 at the next junction . NY 13 northbound continues east along Clinton Avenue while NY 13 southbound heads south along Church Street on an overlap with US 11 and NY 41 . 
 = = History = = 
 The east – west highway connecting the village of Groton to the city of Cortland was originally improved to state highway standards as part of three separate projects in the early 20th century . On July 10 , 1906 , the first project was let to rebuild the section between the Cortland city line and Highland Road , a north – south road west of what is now Cortland County – Chase Field Airport . The road was added to the state highway system on October 11 , 1907 as unsigned State Highway 446 ( SH 446 ) . A contract to improve the part of the Groton – Cortland road leading west from Highland Road to the Tompkins County line was awarded on April 29 , 1912 , which was accepted into the state highway system on January 8 , 1913 , as SH 996 . 
 In Tompkins County , the road was reconstructed as part of a project contracted out on August 24 , 1916 . Work on the highway was completed in the early @-@ to @-@ mid @-@ 1920s , and the improved road was added to the state highway system as SH 1433 . The Groton – Cortland state highway did not have a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , when hundreds of state @-@ maintained highways were assigned a designation for the first time . SH 446 , SH 996 , and SH 1433 were collectively designated as NY 222 , which continued east into downtown Cortland by way of locally maintained streets . The alignment of NY 222 has not been changed since that time .

 " After I wrote my verse , it was my second show in Seattle . We did two shows , because I sold out both shows . There was like 2 @,@ 000 the first night , and another 2 @,@ 000 on the second night . So it was like , ' Whoa , we sold out both shows ! ' I was already tired from the night before , and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle . I went there , and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote . I wrote most of the verse — the first eight bars — on bus . It was getting closer to the show , and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because , our meet and greets aren ’ t an hour anymore . There ’ s like 300 people or 400 people , so you ’ re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4 . Now we got to go the studio , and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm , so it ’ s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot . But I did it , and after I did it , I ’ m like , ' Ooh , the verse is elite . ' " 
 Following him writing his own verse , Tech N9ne decided he wanted another major rapper on the song after him . He stated , " It was already elite , so I needed somebody who could come after me , and there aren ’ t too many who can do it . " After contemplating over which rapper would be featured on the song , even sending the song to Eminem with hopes he would get on the song , Tech N9ne decided to feature American rapper Kendrick Lamar on the song .

 Secret of Evermore is a role @-@ playing video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . It was released by Square in North America on October 1 , 1995 . In February 1996 , it saw release in the PAL territories of Europe and Australia . A Japanese release was planned to follow the North American release by a few months , but was ultimately cancelled . 
 The story of Secret of Evermore follows a boy and his pet dog as they are inadvertently transported to a fantasy world created by an eccentric inventor . The player guides both the boy and his shapeshifting dog through Evermore , a world that is composed of separate realms , each resembling a different period of real @-@ world history . The gameplay shares many similarities with Secret of Mana , such as real @-@ time battles , a ring @-@ shaped menu system , and the ability to switch control between the two characters . Despite similar game mechanics and a similar title , it is not an entry in the Mana series . 
 Secret of Evermore is unique in that it is the only game developed by Square designers in North America . The game received positive reviews upon its release due to its graphics and gameplay , but was criticized for not being up to the standards of what many reviewers were used to by its developer . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Secret of Evermore takes many of its interface and gameplay aspects from Secret of Mana . The game mostly consists of an aerial view setting , in which the boy and his dog negotiate the terrain and fend off hostile creatures . If the boy is currently selected as the player character , his dog will be controlled by the artificial intelligence , and vice versa . Both characters can find refuge in caves or a town , where they can regain their hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment . Upon collecting enough experience points in battle , either character can increase in level with improved stats such as strength and evasion . Options including changing equipment , casting alchemy spells , or checking status can be quickly performed by rotating through the game 's Action Ring system . Combat takes place in real @-@ time . Located below the players hit points is a percentage gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy , as well as how far the player can run . Swinging a weapon or running causes the gauge to fall to 0 % and then quickly recharges , allowing the character to attack at full strength or to run at full sprint once it is full . The gauge may also fill up to allowing the player to use charged attacks with equipped weapons . 
 The protagonist wields four different styles of weapons throughout the game : sword , spear , axe , and bazooka . Almost all swords , axes , and spears have four versions , and repeated use of them can increase their skill levels to a maximum of three , unlocking a new charged attack with each level . The range and power of each type of weapon increased the more it is used ; for instance , spears at a high enough level may be thrown at an enemy across the screen , while the swords and axes can cut swathes of destruction around the boy 's vicinity . With the exception of the Bone Crusher , all swords , axes , and spears can cut through vegetation ; some weapons are required to break rocks and other barriers . 
 In each of the four worlds of Secret of Evermore , the in @-@ game currency will change . The shopkeepers in Prehistoria exchange talons ; in Antiqua , gemstones ; in Gothica , gold coins ; and in Omnitopia , credits . There are individuals in each region who offer to convert the player 's money to the local currency . In either of the game 's two marketplaces ( located in Antiqua and Gothica , respectively ) , the storekeepers offer to trade in goods instead of money . Certain goods , such as rice , spices , and tapestries , can be bought using the local currency , but others must be exchanged for other goods . Most vendors only specialize in one type of good , and some rare items require an extensive amount of trading to obtain . 
 = = = Alchemy = = = 
 A unique element to Secret of Evermore is its system of magic . In order to cast magic , the boy must be given an " <unk> Formula " by one of many non @-@ playable characters called " Alchemists " . Some Alchemists make their home in out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ way areas and will dispense rare formulas if the player manages to seek them out . Unlike some role @-@ playing games , there are no magic points needed to cast spells . Alchemy Formulas require pairs of ingredients in order to be used ; Some are available throughout the game , and others are only native to certain environments . In the primitive realms , ingredients appear as such items as wax , limestone , clay , and gunpowder . In the advanced realms , however , the ingredients become more complex , such as ethanol and dry ice . 
 A secondary function of the dog is to " sniff out " ingredients by putting his nose to the ground and smelling for items . The player can command the dog to search the ground at any time , including in huts and cities . If all goes well , the dog will lead his human companion to a certain spot on the map , where the player can uncover the unseen ingredients . With repeated use , Alchemy Formulas will increase in level , enhancing their curative , offensive , or support effectiveness . Although there are dozens of Formulas available to be found within the game , only nine can be equipped at a time . To overcome this , there are several Alchemists scattered throughout the game who offer to manage the boy 's current Alchemy list ; any formula that has already been learned can be stored by the Alchemist for later use .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 The plot revolves around a teenage boy and his dog , to whom the player must assign names . Most of the game takes place in the fictional world of Evermore . The player explores four main areas within this world , corresponding to different historical eras : Prehistoria contains cavemen and dinosaurs ; Antiqua boasts a Colosseum and pyramid theme ; Gothica contains medieval castles and is populated by dragons ; and Omnitopia is a futuristic space station . 
 Throughout their travels , the boy , at the company of his dog , often quotes or mentions fictional B movies that relate to their current situation . For example , he compares himself to " Dandy " Don Carlisle in the film Sink , Boat , Sink after washing ashore at <unk> . ( For legal reasons , all references to movies and actors were fictional . ) In addition , the dog 's body transforms based on the theme of the area that players are in . In the world of Prehistoria , the dog is transformed into a feral wolf , in the Antiqua region he becomes a greyhound , in Gothica he takes the form of a fancy poodle , and in Omnitopia he becomes a robotic toaster @-@ dog capable of shooting lasers . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The story of Secret of Evermore begins with a black and white flashback to 1965 , in a small town called Podunk , USA . In a laboratory situated on the roof of a mansion , a malfunction occurs which floods the area with white flash of light . Thirty years later , the game 's young protagonist is leaving a theater when his pet dog chases after a cat in the street . The boy hurriedly follows after him , eventually reaching a large , abandoned mansion . He discovers the hidden laboratory with a large machine built in the center . When the dog begins to chew on some wires , the pair find themselves transported to the surreal world of Evermore , beginning in the space station Omnitopia . A butler dressed in a white tuxedo greets the boy when he appears , only to lock him in a room with several attack robots . The boy manages to escape in a shuttle pod , where he finds his dog holed up in the cockpit . 
 The shuttle crash @-@ lands in a dense jungle on top of a plateau . When the boy emerges , he finds a ferocious @-@ looking beast has replaced his dog . He decides to perform a test to see if the wolf and his pet dog are one and the same ; he tosses a stick for the wolf to fetch , only to receive a giant bone instead . The boy shrugs this off and assumes that it is the same dog . 
 In each of the four realms , the boy encounters a citizen of Podunk involved in the original experiment gone awry 30 years ago . Professor Sidney Ruffleberg and his three companions were transported to Evermore , but are unable to leave . The boy quickly learns that the regions are manifestations of those citizens ' personal utopias . Each of the three companions act as the ruler of his or her world : Elizabeth , the Professor 's niece , is the tribal chief of Prehistoria ; Horace Highwater , curator of the Podunk Museum , oversees Antiqua ; Camellia <unk> , a portly librarian , is the Queen of Gothica ; and Professor Ruffleberg monitors everything from Omnitopia , with his android butler , Carltron , alongside him . Within Prehistoria , Antiqua , and Gothica , the boy and his canine companion aid Elizabeth , Horace , and Camellia in thwarting attempts by robotic clones of the Podunk citizens from ruling their respective areas . 
 The duo finally returns to Omnitopia and finds Ruffleberg , who explains everything . He and his butler Carltron once engaged in chess matches . Ruffleberg outfitted him with an intelligence chip to make him a more challenging opponent , but the upgrade backfired by making Carltron more malevolent . He sabotaged the transporter to Evermore and designed the hostile beasts roaming the game . With Ruffleberg 's help , the boy and his canine companion break into Carltron 's room . The area is guarded by android clones of the boy and his dog , along with a giant mecha version of Carltron . At the last moment , Ruffleberg appears and deactivates Carltron , who promptly freezes in place . 
 With Carltron 's defeat , the monsters plaguing Evermore disappear , but the world itself grows unstable . The boy returns to each of the worlds to collect Ruffleberg 's companions , taking them back to the real world . In doing so , Evermore 's destruction is averted and it continues to exist without them . After the credits roll , a final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task of cleaning the lab . Carltron grins and rubs his hands together , implying that he is not as docile as the professor believes . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development on Secret of Evermore began in early 1994 at Square Soft , the Redmond , Washington office of the Japanese parent company Square . The concept of a boy traveling with his dog through a world based on cheesy B movies was dictated from overseas , whereupon Square Soft began work on the detailed storyline . This resulted in popular culture references and dialog that are distinctly American for a mainstream console RPG . The game 's associate producer and writer , George Sinfield , decided that making such references would be familiar to American players . The working title for the game was " Vex and the <unk> . " Producer Alan Weiss originally had the concept of a group of magic users who " could tell dream stories and transport the listeners into the experience , virtually . During one of these storytelling sessions , Vex got trapped in one of these worlds and started to corrupt the dreams . The game was going to be about finding Vex and defeating him . " But when George Sinfield asked the name be changed , the studio had a naming competition which resulted in Secret of Evermore . 
 Many of Secret of Evermore 's elements were copied from Secret of Mana because they had been proven to be effective . The size of the game was an early issue . It was decided that the game would be single @-@ player to preserve memory because it was originally planned to be only 12 @-@ megabits . However , the game would double to 24 @-@ megabits near the end of development . Various pieces of concept art were designed by Daniel <unk> . Using computer software , including SGI Indy II and Alias workstations , the game 's artwork and design were mapped out by three animators , four background artists , and a 3D rendering artist . It was put together using the company 's SAGE ( Square 's Amazing Graphical Editor ) program , led by programmer Brian Fehdrau . Rather than having to hand off their work to the programmers , the artists and designers were able to test their ideas directly using the SAGE program . Using another company program , <unk> ( Square Interpreted Game Intelligence Language ) , Secret of Evermore was made into a final product . One of the worlds that was cut was called <unk> " where ' everything is all flowers and sweet stuff , excessively so . ' It was pink and purple . " 
 There is a persistent misconception that the game is , or was released in lieu of , a follow @-@ up to Secret of Mana . Other Square titles such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger were being localized simultaneously with the production of Secret of Evermore . Fehdrau explained in an interview that Secret of Evermore was not created in place of Seiken Densetsu 3 and that the team that developed Secret of Evermore was assembled from newly hired staff , and would otherwise never have been assembled . Several of the team members joined Humongous Entertainment , which spawned <unk> Entertainment , while the rest of the team spread to other Seattle @-@ area game studios like Electronic Arts , Boss Game Studios , Microsoft Game Studios , and Gas Powered Games , among others . 
 Secret of Evermore was released on October 1 , 1995 , in North America . In 1996 , it was translated into German , French and Spanish for the non @-@ English @-@ speaking market in some PAL territories , including Australia and New Zealand . Some PAL versions were packaged in a large box and included a strategy guide . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The score for Secret of Evermore was composed and produced by Jeremy Soule as his first video game project . While still in high school , Soule was a large fan of video games and he felt that the scores in most games " lacked drama and intensity . " After completing high school , Soule created an experimental demo showcasing what he felt video game scores should sound like . Soule was hired by Square Soft after reviewing the demo and was promptly given the task to score Secret of Evermore . The score is described by Soule as a mix of ambient sounds and low @-@ key music . The soundtrack was released on a CD containing 29 tracks , the first eight of which are arranged versions of the original sound . The disc was published by Square and was only initially available to those who pre @-@ ordered Secret of Evermore . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Secret of Evermore received positive reviews from most media outlets . Most publications praised its graphics . For instance , RPGFan called the game a " wonderful visual experience , " applauding its use of color , animation , and background . Zachary Lewis of RPGamer noted that the locales found in Secret of Evermore were detailed in a much more realistic way than other games of the genre . GamePro was complimentary of its American art @-@ style , but longed for the Japanese art found in other Square titles . Another highlight for many critics was gameplay , particularly aspects also found in Secret of Mana such as the ring menu . 
 Reviewers were more critical concerning the game 's sound . Although the musical score was appreciated for its overall quality , both RPGFan and RPGamer found that there were too few adequately long tracks , with mediocre ambient sound effects to fill the dead time . Critics were mixed on the issue of Secret of Evermore being the first game developed by Square in the United States . Super Play found that the game was not up to the standards held by other Square games . Others noted that Secret of Evermore was a decent first attempt by the American team . GamePro dubbed the game " worthy of a sequel , " while Game Players anticipated another game from the same development team . 
 = Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish = 
 " Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish " is the fourth episode of The Simpsons ' second season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 1 , 1990 . In the episode , Bart catches a three @-@ eyed fish in a river downstream of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant . This causes the plant to become inspected , and in order to prevent it from being shut down , Mr. Burns decides to run for governor . After a hard campaign which sees Burns rise from being universally despised to running neck and neck with popular incumbent Mary Bailey , it is decided that Burns will have dinner with a random employee the night before the election . Homer is chosen , much to Marge 's chagrin . 
 The episode was written by Sam Simon and John Swartzwelder , and directed by Wes Archer . It was the first episode produced for season two and was intended to air as the season premiere , but was replaced with " Bart Gets an " F " " due to Bart 's popularity in the early 1990s . The episode features cultural references to several American films , mostly the 1941 film Citizen Kane , with Burns in the role of the character Charles Foster Kane . Mary Bailey shares her name with George Bailey 's wife in the 1946 film It 's a Wonderful Life . 
 Journalists have described the episode as a satire on both American politics and environmentalism . It won an Environmental Media Award in 1991 for being the best television episode of the year with an environmental message . Since the episode first aired , the three @-@ eyed fish Blinky has been mentioned several times in news articles regarding nuclear waste and mutation . The episode was positively received by television critics for its satire on American politics . It acquired a Nielsen rating of 15 @.@ 8 , and was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network the week it aired . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Bart and Lisa go fishing downstream of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant , and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton pulls up just as Bart catches a three @-@ eyed fish , much to both the kids ' and Shutton 's surprise . The fish , nicknamed Blinky by the media , makes headlines around the state , and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to mutate . After the inspection , the plant 's owner , Mr. Burns , is presented with a list of 342 violations , which would cost $ 56 million to rectify . Distraught , Burns talks to plant employee Homer , who half @-@ heartedly suggests Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down . Burns instantly pounces on the idea . 
 Burns 's political advisers break the news to Burns that he is greatly despised by many people while Bailey is beloved by all . To compensate for this , they force Burns to try being friendly and even smile . Burns makes a television commercial discussing Blinky with an actor portraying Charles Darwin , who claims Blinky is an evolutionary step and not a mutated fish . Combined with a promise to lower taxes and a smear campaign against Bailey , Burns ties with her in the polls . On the night before the election , Burns 's advisers suggest that Burns have dinner at the home of a middle @-@ class family as an opportunity to put himself in the lead . Burns scans his employees for the most average man he can find , and Homer is chosen . 
 The impending dinner with Burns divides the Simpson household . Homer supports Burns , while Marge and Lisa oppose him . Before the dinner arrives , Burns 's advisers prepare the family for the event , even giving them pre @-@ written questions to ask in lieu of conversation . Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all , but Marge tells her not to worry . To everyone 's surprise , Marge serves Blinky for dinner . Burns tries to act as if it does not bother him , but is not able to keep from spitting it out . The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air , and by the time the chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his gubernatorial campaign dissolves . Bailey wins the election and , despite Burns saying that Homer 's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive , the Simpson family happily get together again .

 The episode was written by Sam Simon and John Swartzwelder , and directed by Wes Archer . Blinky had previously made a brief appearance in the season one episode " Homer 's Odyssey " , in which he was seen swimming in the lake outside of the plant . The writers liked the design of the fish and decided to devote an episode to him . While the idea of Blinky was completely fictional at the time , a three @-@ eyed fish was caught in 2011 in Córdoba , Argentina near a local nuclear power plant . The fish was a <unk> and did not resemble Blinky besides the three eyes . The fishermen sent the fish to a radiation test , to determine whether the mutation came from being exposed to the water from the nuclear power plant . 
 Mary Bailey and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton made their first appearance on the show in this episode . Dave Shutton , voiced by Harry Shearer , was named after a friend of Swartzwelder . Dave Shutton 's roles have since become less relevant and have been reduced to cameos and appearances in crowd scenes . Mary Bailey would later appear briefly in episodes such as " Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade " and " The Seven @-@ Beer Snitch " . 
 During the first season of The Simpsons , Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television in what was termed " Bartmania " . Due to the success of the first season , the Fox network decided to switch The Simpsons ' timeslot in hopes that it would steal ratings from NBC 's " powerhouse " line up . The show was moved from its 8 : 00 p.m. EST Sunday night slot to the same time on Thursday , where it would compete with NBC 's The Cosby Show , the number one show at the time . " Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish " was the first episode produced for the second season , but " Bart Gets an F " aired first because of Bart 's popularity and the producers wanted to premiere with an episode involving him in hopes of stealing viewers from The Cosby Show .

 The name of the episode comes from the slogan in a political advert used in Herbert Hoover 's presidential campaign in 1928 , " A Chicken In Every Pot " , which the advert later amplifies with " And a car in every backyard , to boot . " . 
 Several parts of the episode are inspired by the 1941 film Citizen Kane , all with Mr. Burns in the role of Charles Foster Kane . The campaign rally scene where Burns speaks in front of a giant poster of himself is a reference to a scene from that film . The scene where Burns trashes the Simpson family 's dining room after the dinner is similar to the scene in which Kane destroys his ex @-@ wife 's room . 
 Mary Bailey shares her name with George Bailey 's wife in the 1946 film It 's a Wonderful Life . 
 Burns hires an actor to portray the nineteenth @-@ century scientist Charles Darwin to help in his claim that the three @-@ eyed fish was the result of evolution . Darwin was a naturalist who presented compelling evidence that all species of life have evolved over time from common ancestors , through the process he called natural selection . 
 The clip of Burns driving a military tank in his campaign montage is similar to a clip featured in Michael Dukakis 's 1988 United States presidential campaign , in which he can be seen driving a tank . 
 A re @-@ run of the episode that aired on June 25 , 1992 , included a new chalkboard gag in the opening credits that featured Bart writing " It 's potato , not potatoe " on the chalkboard . This is a reference to a spelling blunder by the then @-@ Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle , who corrected a student 's correct spelling of " potato " to " potatoe " at an elementary school spelling bee in Trenton , New Jersey , on June 15 , 1992 .

 Journalists have described " Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish " as a satire on American politics . Joanne Ostrow , a reviewer for The Denver Post , said only a cartoon could get away with " such pointed satire " of American political campaigning and advertising that is featured in the episode . She compared it to the " counter @-@ cultural posture " television shows such as Second City Television and Saturday Night Live took in the mid @-@ 1970s : " In those days , this sort of alternative viewpoint was kept out of prime time . [ In The Simpsons case ] , it 's still relegated to the ( distant ) fourth network , but at least the time is prime . " Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk wrote : " The writers of The Simpsons have often come across as unabashedly liberal and this episode is no exception as political / social commentary takes a step closer to the foreground during this episode . " Al Jean , current show runner of The Simpsons , has himself admitted in an interview that the show is of a " liberal bent " . In the DVD commentaries , creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times that they are very liberal , but some , such as John Swartzwelder ( one of the writers of this and many other The Simpsons episodes ) , are libertarian . The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker . Thus , the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light . In The Simpsons , politicians are corrupt , ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers , and the local police force is incompetent . 
 The episode also features an environmentalism theme . This theme is present in the nuclear power plant 's polluting of Lake Springfield , which causes the fish of the lake to become mutated . University of the Sciences in Philadelphia physics and mathematics professor Paul Halpern discussed the episode in his book What 's Science Ever Done for Us ? : What the Simpsons Can Teach Us About Physics , Robots , Life , and the Universe . He comments : " Considering the fact that [ Charles Darwin 's theory of ] natural selection takes generations and that successful varieties must sustain a survival advantage over others , the only way Mr. Burns can prove his assertion [ that the fish is the next step in evolution through natural selection ] is by tracking Blinky over time to see if the third eye allows the mutant fish to find food more quickly or dodge predators . " Mark Meister and Phyllis M. Japp discuss the environmental theme of the episode in their book <unk> : Studies in Environmental Rhetoric and Popular Culture . The authors think human pollution is characterized in the episode as an improvement on nature , and human progress is viewed as an " integral " part of human evolution . They add : " These references articulate specific criticism of current environmental regulations , specifically the lax enforcement of the regulations concerning the dumping , safe storage , and disposal of nuclear waste . Furthermore , this episode condemns the manipulation of political and economic power to disguise ecological accountability and to shift blame for environmental problems . " The authors also say the episode comments on the lack of adherence to safety standards for the plant , and criticizes the " apathetic acceptance " of unforced environmental inspections . In addition , they comment that the episode " explicitly criticizes media spin @-@ doctors who distort the impacts of ecological degradation caused by wealthy corporations such as the nuclear power plant . " 
 On February 13 , 1991 , a local group in Albany , New York , fought the government 's plan to create a nuclear waste dump in their neighborhood . It was staged by Citizens Against Radioactive <unk> ( <unk> ) at the monthly meeting of the Low @-@ Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission in Albany . Here four children dressed up as Homer , Marge , Bart , and Lisa , and presented a three @-@ eyed fabric fish , which looked like Blinky , to the commission . In addition to that they performed a rap song , which explained the plot of the episode . 
 Since the episode 's initial airing , Blinky has been mentioned several times in news articles regarding nuclear waste and mutation . A reporter for the Lincoln Journal Star compared Blinky to a rainbow trout with two mouths caught in Lincoln , Nebraska , in 2005 . The fish was mentioned in a National Review article discussing a legislation which would make it illegal to import , possess or release alive into California any live transgenic fish : " Sounds like someone watched one too many episodes of The Simpsons with Blinky , the three @-@ eyed fish that swims by the nuclear @-@ power plant . " Matt Smith of SF Weekly compared Blinky to a type of fish found in San Francisco Bay , which , according to a study by the University of California , Davis , had a shrunken brain and misshapen body that had been caused by the dumping of toxic chemicals into the bay . In an article about the now closed nuclear weapons production facility Rocky Flats Plant , Brian Park of The Rocky Mountain Collegian joked that after its closure , " years of clean up ensued and now the area is a wildlife refuge ; no word yet if Blinky has been spotted . " Barbara Taormina of the North Shore Sunday wrote in her article about the new liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) pipeline in Massachusetts Bay : " Will Blinky , the mutant three @-@ eyed fish from The Simpsons be showing up in Massachusetts Bay ? Probably not , but local environmentalists are worried that digging for the new LNG pipeline may stir up radioactive waste dumped decades ago . " In his article about the nuclear power plant operator Exelon , Thomas M. Anderson of Kiplinger wrote : " The thought of more nuclear power may conjure up images of the Three Mile Island accident or Blinky [ ... ] , but a growing number of policymakers and even environmentalists are coming to appreciate the advantages of atomic energy .

The Simpsons was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , but was beaten by The Cosby Show which got a 20 @.@ 2 rating . The episode won an Environmental Media Award in the " Best Television Episodic Comedy " category , which has been awarded every year since 1991 to the best television episode with an environmental message . It was The Simpsons first Environmental Media Award , but the show has won six more since then . 
 The episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics since airing . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , called the episode a " superb example " of political satire , " demonstrating the lengths people will go to to win votes . Marge , of course , sees straight through Burns and uses Blinky the three @-@ eyed fish to demonstrate his lack of conviction . " Phil Rosenthal of the Los Angeles Daily News called the episode a " wonderful stab " at American politics and the " media machine that drives it " , and added : " The message is so subtle , the makers of The Simpsons might deny it is there at all for fear of turning off a portion of its audience . Truth is , you may very well be so busy laughing and taking in the fine details , such as the references to Citizen Kane , to notice . " Hal Boedeker of The Miami Herald said the episode took " some well @-@ aimed satirical jabs at American politics and the publics ' short attention span . The episode has the wit of the best of All in the Family , and benign mother Marge becomes a force for good , in the Edith Bunker tradition . " Virginia Mann of The Record called the episode " terrific " , though she believed its social and political " overtones " were more likely to appeal to adults than children . Tom Shales of the Washington Post described the episode as " a bull 's @-@ eye political satire " . 
 Doug Pratt , a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor , thought the episode 's story was " nicely composed , so you don 't have to recognize the Citizen Kane references to appreciate the effort , but it adds to the fun . " He also noted that it begins the exploration of Mr. Burns " in earnest , the first of many characters who will receive elaborate coverage as the series advances . " Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk thought both Lisa 's " tremendous intellect " and Marge 's " moral compass " were " probed " in the episode , and he thought one " clear highlight " of the episode was Burns 's attempts to explain away Blinky 's mutation by turning to an actor portraying Charles Darwin who proceeds to give a speech suggesting that Blinky is merely advanced . DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson wrote : " The episode took an unusual approach for an early show , as it focused largely on a secondary character . One could argue that season one ’ s ' Krusty Gets Busted ' did the same , but ' Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish ' provided a heavier emphasis on Burns than that prior program did Krusty . This helped make it a fairly good episode . It fleshed out Burns ’ character a little better and gave us a reasonably entertaining experience . The episode fell short of greatness , but it worked nicely for the most part . " Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as " masterful " .

 = Armillaria luteobubalina = 
 Armillaria luteobubalina , commonly known as the Australian honey fungus , is a species of mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae . Widely distributed in southern Australia , the fungus is responsible for a disease known as Armillaria root rot , a primary cause of Eucalyptus tree death and forest dieback . It is the most pathogenic and widespread of the six Armillaria species found in Australia . The fungus has also been collected in Argentina and Chile . Fruit bodies have cream- to tan @-@ coloured caps that grow up to 10 cm ( 4 in ) in diameter and stems that measure up to 20 cm ( 8 in ) long by 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 in ) thick . The fruit bodies , which appear at the base of infected trees and other woody plants in autumn ( March – April ) , are edible , but require cooking to remove the bitter taste . The fungus is dispersed through spores produced on gills on the underside of the caps , and also by growing vegetatively through the root systems of host trees . The ability of the fungus to spread vegetatively is facilitated by an aerating system that allows it to efficiently diffuse oxygen through rhizomorphs — rootlike structures made of dense masses of hyphae . 
 Armillaria luteobubalina was first described in 1978 , after having been discovered several years earlier growing in a Eucalyptus plantation in southeastern Australia . It distinguished itself from other known Australian Armillaria species by its aggressive pathogenicity . It may take years for infected trees to show signs of disease , leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence . Studies show that the spread of disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations . Although several methods have been suggested to control the spread of disease , they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible . Phylogenetic analyses have determined that A. luteobubalina is closely related to A. montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species A. <unk> . The distribution of A. luteobubalina suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana . 
 = = History and phylogeny = = 
 Armillaria luteobubalina was first described in 1978 by mycologists Roy Watling and Glen Kile , who studied its effects on a fast @-@ growing plantation of Eucalyptus regnans near Traralgon , Victoria . The plantation , established in 1963 , consisted largely of trees with a mean height of about 25 m ( 80 ft ) . A cluster of dead and dying trees discovered in 1973 suggested attack by a virulent primary pathogen , that is , one capable of infecting a host before invasion by other , secondary pathogens . This finding was inconsistent with the pathogenic behaviour of the known Armillaria species in Australia at the time , A. mellea and A. elegans . Further study over the next few years showed that the fungus spread by the growth of underground mycelia in root systems , expanding outward from the initial infected stump at an average of 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) per year . Most Australian records of Armillaria infections referred to A. mellea , based on the presence of black rhizomorphs . For over one hundred years , A. mellea was thought to be a pleiomorphic ( occurring in various distinct forms ) species with a widespread distribution and host range , and variable <unk> which led to great confusion among taxonomists and plant pathologists alike . In 1973 , Veikko Hintikka reported a technique to distinguish between Armillaria species by growing them together as single spore isolates on petri dishes and observing changes in the morphology of the cultures . Using similar techniques , mycologists eventually determined that the Armillaria mellea species complex in Europe and North America in fact consisted of five and ten distinct " biological species " , respectively . 
 Watling and Kile compared the macroscopic and microscopic characters of the pathogenic Armillaria with A. <unk> ( now known as A. obscura ) , A. mellea , A. limonea and A. novae @-@ <unk> and found sufficient differences between them to warrant designating the species as new . Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin lutea " yellow " , and was chosen to highlight an important distinguishing characteristic : the strong yellow colour of the cap and lack of reddish or brown tones in the stem typical of other resident Armillaria . 
 A phylogenetic study of South American Armillaria species concluded that A. luteobubalina is in a lineage that includes A. montagnei , and these are sister to a lineage containing A. <unk> , a species known from a single specimen collected in São Paulo , Brazil . Although they are very similar , specimens of A. luteobubalina have smaller spores than Argentinian specimens of A. montagnei , and their distinctness is well @-@ supported with phylogenetic analysis . Based on analysis of <unk> enzymes , A. luteobubalina is closely related to A. limonea , a species found in New Zealand ; this result corroborates phylogenetic analyses reported in 2003 and 2006 . Molecular analysis of 27 collections of A. luteobubalina from southwest Western Australia and one from Traralgon revealed four distinct polymorphic groups . The genetic variety suggests it is native to Australia . 
 = = Description = = 
 Up to 10 cm ( 4 in ) in diameter , the cap is convex to flattened in shape with a central umbo ( a rounded elevation ) and is various shades of cream , yellow and tan . The cap surface is covered with darker scales and feels rough to the touch . The cap edge , or margin , is rolled inward in young specimens . The crowded gills are sinuate and white to cream in colour initially , brownish @-@ cream or pinkish brown in maturity , and sometimes with yellow or rust @-@ coloured marks close to the margins . The stem is central ( that is , it joins the cap in the centre ) and is up to 20 cm ( 8 in ) long by 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 in ) thick . It is slightly thicker at its base than its apex , sometimes almost bulb @-@ like . The stem surface is streaked with fibrils that run up and down its length . It has a floppy yellow wool @-@ like ring which may develop irregular , jagged edges with time . The flesh is white , and in the stem has a woolly or stringy consistency . Although it has a hot @-@ bitter taste , Armillaria luteobubalina is edible , and cooking removes the bitterness .

 The spore print is white when fresh , but becomes more cream @-@ coloured when dry . The smooth spores are oval to ellipsoid , hyaline ( translucent ) , non @-@ amyloid ( meaning they do not absorb iodine from Melzer 's reagent ) , and typically measure 6 @.@ 5 – 7 @.@ 5 by 4 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 5 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are thin @-@ walled , hyaline , and lack clamp connections at their bases . They are usually four @-@ spored but occasionally two @-@ spored , with sterigmata ( projections that attach to the spores ) up to 4 μm long . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia that occur on the edge of a gill ) are mostly club @-@ shaped , thin @-@ walled , hyaline , and measure 15 – 30 by 6 – 10 μm . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Five other Armillaria species are found in Australia . Within the range of A. luteobubalina , A. <unk> is restricted to gully habitats . A. fumosa is a rarer species found only in poorly drained or seasonally wet locations . A. luteobubalina and A. montagnei share cap features and a similar unpleasant flavour , but the latter species has an olive @-@ tinged cap , larger spores ( 9 @.@ 5 – 11 by 5 @.@ 5 – 7 µm compared to 6 @.@ 5 – 7 @.@ 5 by 4 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 5 µm ) and a more conspicuous annulus than those found in A. luteobubalina . The morphology of the vegetative structures of A. limonea is distinctly different than A. luteobubalina , and can be used to distinguish the two species . A. novae @-@ <unk> has a sticky more flattened cap and stem below the ring and is found in wet forests , and A. <unk> is a species with cream gills maturing to pale pink found in tropical Australia arising from dead tree stumps or the roots of dead or living trees . A. luteobubalina is the only Armillaria species which occurs in Western Australia . Distinguishing Australian species is economically important , because A. luteobubalina is more pathogenic than the other members of the genus . A molecular diagnostic test , developed in 2002 , can accurately identify each species using DNA extracted from its mycelia . Before this , species identification was limited to times when fruit bodies were in season . This technology also revealed a variation in the molecular material of A. luteobubalina that suggested sexual reproduction . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Armillaria luteobubalina has been recorded in southeastern Australia , from the southeastern corner of Queensland through eastern New South Wales and across Victoria into southeastern South Australia . It also occurs in Tasmania and southwestern Western Australia . Those of the karri forests ( consisting largely of the species E. diversicolor ) of the southwest have paler and yellower caps than those in the jarrah forests ( which contain predominantly Eucalyptus marginata ) further north . The fruit bodies arise on wood , especially on stumps or around the base of trees , and often in huge numbers . They usually appear between April and July , although most production occurs in the second half of May . Abundant in woodlands , it can invade gardens and orchards , where it can attack many woody plants . The honey fungus infected and killed many plants near tuart trees ( Eucalyptus gomphocephala ) which had been cut down near Kings Park in suburban Perth . Armillaria luteobubalina is commonly found in eucalyptus forests in Australia , and is thought to be the most pathogenic and most widespread Armillaria species in the major western Australian forest types . The mushroom has also been reported from southern South America , in Argentina and Chile . A 2003 study of the molecular phylogenetics and pattern of its distribution in South America and Australia indicate that A. luteobubalina is an ancient species , originating before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana . Genetic differences between isolates in the South American and Australian populations indicate a long period of geographical separation , and the authors suggest that they " later might be regarded as independent taxa " . 
 = = Root rot = = 
 = = = Appearance of infected trees = = = 
 Trees that are infected by A. luteobubalina show characteristic symptoms both above and below ground . Above the ground , the base of the tree develops inverted V @-@ shaped lesions , and the infected wood undergoes white rot , a fungal wood decay process where the cellulose and lignin of the sapwood are both broken down , leaving the wood stringy . The bark of the stem dies and becomes discoloured up to 3 m ( 10 ft ) above the ground . Clusters of fruit bodies appear at the base of the tree in autumn . Crowns may show gradual deterioration , or tree death may occur suddenly . Below the ground , characteristic symptoms of infections include rotting the ends of tree roots , white @-@ rotted sapwood , and the presence of fan @-@ shaped areas of white mycelium below dead or infected bark . 
 = = = Occurrence = = = 
 In selectively logged eucalypt forests in the central highlands of Victoria , it has been estimated that about 3 – 5 % of the forest area is " moderately to severely affected " by Armillaria root rot caused by A. luteobubalina . A review of eucalypt plantations planted in New South Wales from 1994 to 2005 found that infection by A. luteobubalina was rare , and only accounted for 1 % of mortality in total . In this instance , the cases had been restricted to Eucalyptus nitens on the Dorrigo Plateau . Unlike other Armillaria species found in Australia 's native forests , which require a host tree to become weakened by prior infection by a different species , A. luteobubalina is a primary pathogen , and can infect healthy trees . Tree roots may be infected for years before showing above @-@ ground symptoms , making it difficult to accurately assess the true extent of disease in a forest stand . Surveys are usually conducted in autumn , to coincide with the appearance of fruit bodies ; infection is assessed by the presence of basal scars on the trees , and the appearance of fruit bodies . Several factors , however — such as cost , variable on @-@ site conditions , and non @-@ symptomatic diseased trees — make it difficult for such surveys to reliably detect all infections . One study showed that above @-@ ground examinations detected only 50 % of the trees actually infected , leading to underestimation of the incidence of true infection by 20 – 40 % . The study used more intensive surveying methods to determine that 25- to 30 @-@ year @-@ old karri regrowth forests in western Australia showed an average of 40 – 45 % incidence of infection . 
 = = = Disease spread = = = 
 Several studies have shown that the spread of Armillaria root rot in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged . Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps , using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years . In one case reported in Ovens , Victoria , the disease was spread to blueberry plants ( Vaccinium species ) via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting . In individual forest stands , fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees — a discontinuous distribution . Large @-@ scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species . The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal dune woodlands , shrubland , and heath communities . It can be found on a wide range of hosts , but is most commonly associated with ( in order of decreasing frequency ) jarrah ( Eucalyptus marginata ) , bull banksia ( Banksia grandis ) , marri ( E. calophylla ) , Lasiopetalum <unk> , and Acacia saligna . It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo ( E. wandoo ) . The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina , and Pinus radiata in Chile . Armillaria luteobubalina uses " an elaborate , sophisticated aeration system " that enables it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the rhizomorphs , helping it thrive in low @-@ oxygen environments . When grown in culture , the mycelium develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust . This tissue is hydrophobic and resistant to becoming waterlogged . <unk> develop beneath clusters of so @-@ called " air @-@ pores " near the perforations . These gas spaces connect the atmosphere with the central canal of the rhizomorph , to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate the organism 's high oxygen requirement during growth . This aeration system is thought to be an important factor in the organism 's pathogenicity , allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps , where conditions may be hypoxic . The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern , so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals . Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than Armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch <unk> ( where lateral branches grow from a main stem ) . Although the structure of A. luteobubalina rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions , the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient @-@ rich soil . 
 = = = Control = = = 
 Methods for controlling the spread of Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees , stumps and large roots ; fumigation of soil around infected hosts ; and injection of <unk> directly into infected hosts . These methods are often not practical due to high cost , introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms , or health and safety issues for the operator . Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A. luteobubalina . In one study , thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A. luteobubalina and one of the saprobic wood decay fungi <unk> versicolor , Stereum hirsutum and <unk> <unk> ; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A. <unk> . These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests , where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A. luteobubalina on the stump base .

 Sir Michael Francis Addison Woodruff , FRS , FRCS ( 3 April 1911 – 10 March 2001 ) was an English surgeon and scientist principally remembered for his research into organ transplantation . Though born in London , Woodruff spent his youth in Australia , where he earned degrees in electrical engineering and medicine . Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of World War II , he joined the Australian Army Medical Corps , but was soon captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp . While there , he devised an ingenious method of extracting nutrients from agricultural wastes to prevent malnutrition among his fellow POWs . 
 At the conclusion of the war , Woodruff returned to England and began a long career as an academic surgeon , mixing clinical work and research . Woodruff principally studied transplant rejection and immunosuppression . His work in these areas of transplantation biology , led Woodruff to perform the first kidney transplant in the United Kingdom , on 30 October 1960 . For this and his other scientific contributions , Woodruff was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1968 and made a Knight Bachelor in 1969 . Although retiring from surgical work in 1976 , he remained an active figure in the scientific community , researching cancer and serving on the boards of various medical and scientific organizations . He died on 10 March 2001 , at the age of 89 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Michael Woodruff was born on 3 April 1911 in Mill Hill , London , England . In 1913 , his father , Harold Woodruff , a professor of veterinary medicine at the Royal Veterinary College in London , moved the family to Australia so he could take up the post of Professor of Veterinary Pathology and Director of the Veterinary Institute at the University of Melbourne . The elder Woodruff later became the Professor of Bacteriology . The family 's new life in Australia was interrupted by World War I , which prompted Harold to enlist in the armed services . He became an officer in the Australian Army Veterinary Corps and was sent to Egypt . 
 The remainder of the <unk> returned to London , and the two boys lived with their mother and paternal grandmother in the latter 's residence in Finchley . However , Michael and his brother went back to Australia in 1917 after their mother , Margaret , died of a <unk> septicaemia . The two then spent a short time under the care of an aunt before being rejoined by their father in 1917 . 
 In 1919 , Harold remarried and his new wife raised the children from his first marriage . The two boys did their early schooling at Trinity Grammar School in Melbourne . From then on he spent all of his youth in Australia except for a year in Europe in 1924 when his father went on sabbatical leave at Paris 's Pasteur Institute . During this time , Woodruff and his brother boarded at Queen 's College in Taunton , Somerset on the south coast of England . The headmaster at the school derogatorily regarded Australians as " colonials " who were " backward " and put Woodruff in a year level one year lower than appropriate . Upon returning to Australia , Woodruff attended the private Methodist Wesley College , where he enjoyed mathematics and rowing . 
 He won a government scholarship to the University of Melbourne and Queen 's College , a university residential college . Woodruff studied electrical engineering and mathematics , receiving some instruction from the influential physicist Harrie Massey , then a tutor . Despite success in engineering , Woodruff decided that he would have weak prospects as an engineer in Australia because of the Great Depression . He decided to take up medical studies at the end of his third year of undergraduate study , but his parents wanted him to finish his degree first . Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as an engineer , Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first @-@ class honours . He also completed two years of the maths program with first @-@ class honours . 
 After graduating in 1933 , he entered the medical program at the University of Melbourne . His mentors included Anatomy Professor Frederic Wood Jones . While at the University , he passed the primary exam for the Royal College of Surgeons in 1934 , one of only four successful candidates who sat the examination in Melbourne that year . He finished the program in 1937 and received an MBBS with honours as well as two prizes in surgery . After graduation , he studied internal medicine for one more year , and served as a house surgeon at the Royal Melbourne Hospital . Woodruff then started his surgical training . 
 = = World War II = = 
 At the outbreak of World War II , Woodruff joined the Australian Army Medical Corps . He stayed in Melbourne until he finished his Master of Surgery Degree in 1941 . At that time , he was assigned to the Tenth Australian Army General Hospital in Malaya as a captain in the Medical Corps . According to Woodruff , his time in Malaya was quiet and relatively leisurely as the war in the Pacific was yet to begin in earnest . However , after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor changed the situation and he was posted to a casualty clearing station where he worked as an anaesthetist , before being transferred into the Singapore General Hospital . A Japanese offensive resulted in the fall of Singapore and Woodruff was taken prisoner along with thousands of other Australian and British personnel . 
 After being captured , Woodruff was imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp . In the camp , Woodruff realized that his fellow prisoners were at great risk from vitamin deficiencies due to the poor quality of the rations they were issued by the Japanese . To help fight this threat , Woodruff asked for permission from the Japanese to allow him to take responsibility for the matter , which was granted . He devised a method for extracting important nutrients from grass , soya beans , rice <unk> , and agricultural wastes using old machinery that he found at the camp . Woodruff later published an account of his methods through the Medical Research Council titled " Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps " . Woodruff remained a POW for three and a half years and later during this period he was sent to outlying POW camps to treat his comrades . As the prisoners were not allowed to be transferred , he had to improvise in his practise . During this time he also read <unk> 's surgery textbook , as a copy was in the camp , and he later said that reading about the fact that skin allografts were rejected a fortnight after being initially accepted , had stoked his interest in doing research on the topic . 
 At the conclusion of World War II , Woodruff returned to Melbourne to continue his surgical training . During his studies , he served as the surgical associate to Albert Coates . This position was unpaid , so Woodruff accepted an appointment was a part @-@ time pathology lecturer to support himself . In January 1946 , Woodruff participated in an Australian Student Christian Movement meeting , where he met Hazel Ashby , a science graduate from Adelaide . She made a great impression on Woodruff , and he married her half a year later . The couple were research partners for the rest of their lives . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Soon after his marriage , Woodruff decided to travel to England in order to take the second half of the FRCS Exam . Woodruff took his new wife over with no guarantee of employment , and declined a two @-@ year travelling fellowship to Oxford University offered by the Australian Red Cross because it required him to return home and work . Before departing , he applied for a position as a Tutor of Surgery at the University of Sheffield , and learned en route that they had accepted his application . He took the FRCS exam in 1947 and passed — a result that , in Woodruff 's view , was certainly not hindered by the fact that one of his examiners , Colonel Julian Taylor , had been with him at Changi . 
 = = = Sheffield = = = 
 After passing his exam , Woodruff entered his position at Sheffield , where he trained in emergency and elective surgery . Originally , he had planned to do surgical research , but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab . Instead , Woodruff was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he studied transplant rejection , a process in which the immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue . Woodruff was particularly interested in thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection . Woodruff 's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of <unk> and rejection . To further himself in these areas , Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar , an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection . The two men discussed transplantation and rejection , beginning a lasting professional relationship . Despite his achievements at Sheffield , Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital . 
 = = = Aberdeen = = = 
 In 1948 , shortly after applying for the position in Melbourne , Woodruff moved from Sheffield to the University of Aberdeen where he was given a post as a senior lecturer , having not known where the Scottish city was beforehand . At Aberdeen , Woodruff was given better laboratory access under Professor Bill Wilson , and was also awarded a grant that allowed his wife to be paid for her services . He took advantage of this access and his wife 's skills as a lab assistant to investigate in utero grafts ( tissue grafts performed while the recipient was still in the womb ) . At the time , the surgical community hypothesized that if a recipient were given in utero grafts , he would be able to receive tissue from the donor later in life without risk of rejection . Woodruff 's experiments with rats , however , produced negative results . Woodruff also commenced work on <unk> serum for immunosuppression , with little initial success . 
 While in Aberdeen , Woodruff also visited the United States on a World Health Organization ( WHO ) Traveling Fellowship . During the visit , he met many of the leading American surgeons , an experience that increased his own desire to continue his work and research . After returning from the US , Woodruff experimented with the effects of cortisone and the impact of blood antigen on rejection . As part of his blood antigen studies , Woodruff found two volunteers with identical blood antigens and arranged for them to exchange skin grafts . When the grafts were rejected , Woodruff determined that rejection must be controlled by additional factors . In 1951 Woodruff was bestowed a Hunterian Professorship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for his lecture The transplantation of homologous tissue and its surgical application . 
 = = = Dunedin = = = 
 In 1953 , Woodruff moved to Dunedin to take up a position as the Chair of Surgery at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine , New Zealand 's only medical school at that time . Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary 's in London and St Andrews University in Edinburgh . While in Dunedin , Woodruff conducted research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance for allografts in rats . This line of research proved to be largely unsuccessful , but some of Woodruff 's other projects did well . Among his more important accomplishments in the period , Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment . As there was no plastic surgeon in the city , Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns . He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease ( graft versus host disease ) . Although Woodruff had been productive in four years in New Zealand , Dunedin had a population of roughly 100 @,@ 000 , so there were not enough people in the region to supply a clinical medical school , so he began to look for an appointment elsewhere . 
 = = Edinburgh = = 
 In 1957 , Woodruff was appointed to the Chair of Surgical Science at the University of Edinburgh without requiring an interview . At the university , he split his time equally between his clinical and teaching responsibilities and his research . He was also allowed to appoint two assistant researchers who went on to become prominent in their own right , Donald Michie and James Howard . As a major part of his research , Woodruff served as the honorary director of a Research Group on Transplantation established by the Medical Research Council . 
 The research group 's principal investigations concerned immunological tolerance ( the body 's acceptance of tissues , as opposed to rejection ) , autoimmune haemolytic anaemia ( especially in mice ) , and immune responses to cancer in various animals . In his clinical role , Woodruff started a vascular surgery program and worked with the use of immunotherapy as a cancer treatment as well as the treatment of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia . However , his most important clinical accomplishments were in kidney transplantation . 
 Most notably , he performed the first ever kidney transplant in the UK , at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary . Woodruff had been waiting for the right patient for some time , hoping to find a patient with an identical twin to act as the donor , as this would significantly reduce the risk of rejection . The patient that Woodruff eventually found was a 49 @-@ year @-@ old man suffering from severely impaired kidney function who received one of his identical twin brother 's kidneys on 30 October 1960 . Both twins lived an additional six years before dying of an unrelated disease . Woodruff thought that he had to be vigilant with his first kidney transplant , as he regarded the British medical community 's attitude to be conservative towards transplantation . From then until his retirement in 1976 , he performed 127 kidney transplants . Also in 1960 , Woodruff published The Transplantation of Tissues and Organs , a comprehensive survey of transplant biology and one of seven books he wrote . He was awarded the 1969 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science . The corresponding Lister Oration , given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England , was delivered on 8 April 1970 , and was titled ' Biological aspects of individuality ' . 
 The success of Woodruff 's clinical transplant program was recognised and enhanced by funding from the Nuffield Foundation to construct and open the Nuffield Transplant Surgery Unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh . In 1970 an outbreak of hepatitis B struck the transplant unit , resulting in the death of several patients and four of Woodruff 's employees due to fulminant hepatic failure . Woodruff was deeply shaken by the loss and the unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop a contingency plan to avoid such a disaster in future . The unit then resumed operations . 
 Woodruff retired from the University of Edinburgh in 1976 , his role then being filled by Prof Geoffrey Duncan Chisholm , and joined the MRC Clinical and Population <unk> Unit . He spent the next ten years there , engaged in cancer research with an emphasis on tumor immunology using Corynebacterium parva . During that time , Woodruff also published twenty @-@ five papers and two books . After retiring from his cancer research , Woodruff lived quietly with his wife in Edinburgh , traveling occasionally , until his death there on 10 March 2001 at the age of 89 .

 Woodruff 's contributions to surgery were important and long @-@ lasting . In addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK , he devised a method of implanting a transplanted ureter in the bladder during transplants that is still used today . Furthermore , he established a large , efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that remains one of the world 's best . Although best known for these clinical accomplishments , Woodruff 's contributions to the study of rejection and tolerance induction were equally important . Among these contributions , Woodruff 's work with anti @-@ lymphocyte serum has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day . 
 These important contributions to medicine and biology were first seriously honoured in 1968 when Woodruff was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society . The next year , 1969 , Woodruff was knighted by the Queen , a rare accomplishment for a surgeon . Additionally , numerous medical organizations gave Woodruff honorary membership , including the American College of Surgeons , the American Surgical Association , and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh . Woodruff also held office in several scientific organizations , serving as Vice @-@ President of the Royal Society and President of The Transplantation Society . Finally , Woodruff served for many years as a WHO advisor and as a visiting professor at a number of universities . 
 Despite his profound influence on transplantation and what Peter Morris called " a commanding presence in any gathering " , Woodruff was not known for his ability as a lecturer as he had a rather uncertain style of presentation and had a tendency to mumble . Nevertheless , Morris said that Woodruff has " a great turn of phrase and a rather wicked sense of humour " . Morris concluded that " What is surprising is that he was not successful in producing many surgeons in his own mould , despite the intellectual talent that was entering surgery and especially transplantation in the 1960s . However , his influence in transplantation at all levels was enormous . "

 The <unk> had two sons , followed by a daughter . Their first son completed a medical degree at University College London and became an ophthalmologist . The two younger children both did their tertiary education at Sheffield University . The second son became a civil engineer and the daughter completed a science degree in botany . 
 Woodruff and his wife were avid tennis players and had a court in their home in Edinburgh . After moving to Edinburgh , Woodruff took up sailing with the Royal Forth Yacht Club , and went on to compete in some races . He owned a boat was known to go sailing on it in the Mediterranean each summer with his wife . During his student years , Woodruff was a keen rower and field hockey player . 
 Woodruff was a lover of classical music , and after taking up the organ at university and learning from A. E Floyd , the organist of St Paul 's Cathedral , he became the college organist at Queen ’ s College in Melbourne ; he later learned to play the piano . In his spare time , Woodruff continued to pursue his love of pure mathematics , especially number theory . He periodically attempted to prove Fermat 's Last Theorem , but failed . 
 = SMS Zieten = 
 SMS Zieten was the first aviso built for the Imperial German Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) . She was built in Britain in 1875 – 1876 , and was the last major warship built for Germany by a foreign shipyard . Ordered as a testbed for the new Whitehead torpedo , Zieten was armed with a pair of 38 cm ( 15 in ) torpedo tubes , and was capable of a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) , making her the fastest ship in the German fleet at the time . Zieten proved to be the first torpedo @-@ armed vessel in a series of avisos that ultimately developed into the first light cruisers . In addition to her impact in German warship design , Zieten also influenced numerous other navies , who built dozens of similar avisos and torpedo vessels of their own . 
 Zieten served for the first two decades of her career with the torpedo boat flotilla . In 1878 – 1880 , she was captained by Alfred von Tirpitz , the future architect of the High Seas Fleet . In 1882 , she cruised the Mediterranean Sea with several other German warships , and was present during the British bombardment of Alexandria , where she protected German interests . Zieten was used as a fishery protection ship from 1899 until 1914 , when the outbreak of World War I necessitated her mobilization as a coastal patrol ship . She served in this capacity for the duration of the war , and was stricken from the naval register in December 1919 . The ship was finally sold for scrapping in August 1921 , after forty @-@ five years of service . 
 = = Design = = 
 In 1869 , the Prussian Navy sent then @-@ Korvettenkapitän Alexander von Monts to Austria to examine the new Whitehead torpedoes then being developed there . Albrecht von Stosch , the commander in chief of the new Imperial German Navy , approved a plan to develop a torpedo arm for the German fleet , and placed Monts in charge of the program in 1873 . That year , Stosch 's naval construction program called for a tender for the new torpedo boats . The tender was ordered from the British firm the Thames Iron Works , and named Zieten . She was to be the last major warship purchased by the German navy from a foreign shipyard . 
 In addition to the planned role as a tender for torpedo boats , she was also intended to serve as a test platform for the new self @-@ propelled torpedo . Up to the mid @-@ 1870s , the German navy had only experimented with a handful of torpedo ships , all of which were equipped with the old spar torpedo . The ship 's design provided the basis for both later German avisos — the Blitz class — and all subsequent light cruisers , but also to numerous foreign designs , such as several classes of French , Italian , and Austrian avisos and torpedo craft . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Zieten was 69 @.@ 5 meters ( 228 ft ) long at the waterline and 79 @.@ 4 m ( 260 ft ) long overall . She had a beam of 8 @.@ 56 m ( 28 @.@ 1 ft ) and a draft of 3 @.@ 8 m ( 12 ft ) forward . She displaced 1 @,@ 001 metric tons ( 985 long tons ; 1 @,@ 103 short tons ) as designed and up to 1 @,@ 170 t ( 1 @,@ 150 long tons ; 1 @,@ 290 short tons ) at full combat load . The hull was constructed with transverse iron frames and contained eight watertight compartments . Initially , Zieten had only a small bridge forward , but in 1899 , a new superstructure was built ; it included a conning tower with a compass platform . A chart house was also added forward of the funnel . 
 Zieten was a good sea boat with a gentle motion , but she was very crank . She was very maneuverable , but she handled poorly in a head sea . In bad weather , she took on considerable amounts of water and was very dangerous . The ship had a crew of 6 officers and 88 enlisted men , though later in her career the figure rose to 7 and 99 , respectively . During her career as a fishery protection ship , it rose further , to 7 officers and 104 sailors . Zieten carried a number of smaller boats : one picket boat , one cutter , two yawls , and one dinghy . Later in her career , the picket boat was removed and two barges were added .

 The ships propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 2 @-@ cylinder double expansion engines manufactured by John Penn and Sons . The engines drove two 3 @-@ bladed propellers that were 3 @.@ 05 m ( 10 @.@ 0 ft ) wide in diameter . Steam was provided by six coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers , also manufactured by John Penn and Sons , which were trunked into a single funnel amidships . The boilers were replaced with new models in 1891 during a refit at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel . As built , Zieten was fitted with a schooner rig with a sail area of 355 square meters ( 3 @,@ 820 sq ft ) to supplement her steam engines , but this was later reduced to only an auxiliary gaff sail . 
 The engines were rated at 2 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 500 kW ) , but only managed to reach 1 @,@ 807 ihp ( 1 @,@ 347 kW ) at maximum power . With the new boilers , the engines reached 2 @,@ 376 ihp ( 1 @,@ 772 kW ) . Her top speed as designed was to have been 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) , but with her original boilers , she could make 15 @.@ 9 knots ( 29 @.@ 4 km / h ; 18 @.@ 3 mph ) at full power . This speed nevertheless made Zieten the fastest ship in the German fleet . With the new boilers , she could steam at up to 16 @.@ 3 knots ( 30 @.@ 2 km / h ; 18 @.@ 8 mph ) . Zieten could carry up to 130 t ( 130 long tons ; 140 short tons ) of coal , which allowed her to steam for 1 @,@ 770 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 280 km ; 2 @,@ 040 mi ) at a cruising speed of 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . During the refit , she also had one electricity generator , with an output of 10 kilowatts ( 13 hp ) at 67 volts , installed . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Zieten 's primary armament consisted of a pair of 38 @-@ centimeter ( 15 in ) torpedo tubes . Both were submerged in the hull , one in the bow and one in the stern . They were supplied with a total of ten Whitehead torpedoes . These powerful weapons , coupled with the ship 's high speed and maneuverability , made her a powerful vessel for the period . In 1878 , the forward torpedo tube was relocated to a swivel launched mounted on the deck , and two 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns were installed . She was also equipped with six machine guns . Later in her career , the torpedo tubes were removed , due to their obsolescence , and she was rearmed with six 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) SK L / 40 guns , though two were later removed . The guns were supplied with a total of 864 rounds of ammunition , and could engage targets out to 6 @,@ 200 m ( 20 @,@ 300 ft ) . She was also equipped to lay naval mines , and she could carry 49 of them .

 Zieten was built by the Thames Iron Works in London . She was laid down in 1875 and was launched on 9 March 1876 . She was completed on 15 July 1876 , and commissioned into the German fleet on 1 August . She was thereafter used in experiments with early torpedoes and as a tender for torpedo boats . In 1876 , Otto von Diederichs served aboard the ship as her executive officer in her first crew . In August , the ship conducted sea trials in the North Sea , before arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 11 August for fitting @-@ out work . Diederichs supervised the installation of the ship 's torpedo tubes , along with the magazine for storing the torpedoes . The work lasted until September , which prevented Zieten from participating in the annual August – September fleet exercises . As a result , she was placed in reserve on 17 September for the winter . In March 1877 , Diederichs returned to the ship and prepared her for service in the training season that year . The ship was ready for active duty by 11 June , and thereafter conducted further sea trials and torpedo training . 
 After Zieten entered service in June 1877 , Diederichs was replaced by Alfred von Tirpitz , who took over torpedo testing while he was assigned to the Torpedo School at Kiel . Diederichs meanwhile readied the old gunboat Scorpion as a tender for Zieten . On 18 September , Zieten and Scorpion participated in the first major test of the new Whitehead torpedoes in the German navy . During the exercises , Zieten scored three hits on a stationary target , which was deemed a great success . After the conclusion of the maneuvers , Zieten was placed in reserve on 2 October for the winter . The analysis of the testing showed that the bow @-@ mounted torpedo tube was not satisfactory , and so Diederichs was tasked with redesigning her armament in January 1878 . Diederichs moved the bow tube to a swivel mount on her deck , and added two 12 cm guns to improve her defense against small warships . 
 The refit work was completed by 16 April 1878 , permitting Tirpitz to take command of the ship on 6 May . He served as the ship 's commander until August 1880 . Tirpitz , as the commander of Germany 's torpedo boat flotilla , staunchly advocated the development of torpedo craft rather than a fleet of battleships . In July 1880 , during maneuvers with the fleet , Zieten torpedoed and sank the old paddle steamer Barbarossa . In 1882 , Zieten joined a cruising squadron that consisted of the corvettes Gneisenau and Nymphe , the steamer Loreley , and a gunboat , for operations in the Mediterranean Sea . The ships were present during the British bombardment of Alexandria in August 1882 ; they sent men ashore to protect the German embassy , along with a German @-@ run hospital . In July , Zieten joined a squadron of ships to take the newly crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II for a tour of Baltic ports , which included a visit to Tsar Alexander III of Russia . 
 The ship was assigned as the dispatch vessel for the Reserve Squadron in the North Sea in 1898 , along with the coastal defense ships Beowulf and Frithjof . Starting in 1899 , Zieten was used intermittently as a fishery protection ship . In September 1902 , Zieten participated in the final exercises during the annual fleet maneuvers . Her career as a fishery protection ship lasted until 1914 , when she was mobilized at the outbreak of World War I in August . She was used as a coast guard ship for the duration of the conflict . After Germany 's defeat , Zieten was stricken from the naval register on 6 December 1919 . The ship was sold on 18 August 1921 for 655 @,@ 000 marks and broken up in Wilhelmshaven . 
 = Kinne Cemetery = 
 Kinne Cemetery , also known as the Glasgo Cemetery and Old Kinne Burying Ground , is a historic cemetery in Jarvis Road in Griswold , Connecticut . The earliest marked stone is for Daniel Kinne who died in 1713 . In the 1930s , the inscriptions of 79 stones in the Kinne Cemetery were recorded for the Hale Index . There are around 80 <unk> with no carving or identification , but it is unknown if this stems from wearing of the gneiss stone or that there were no skilled carvers locally available . The seven carvers that have been identified are Lebbeus Kimball , Jotham Warren , Josiah Manning , Peter Barker , Mr. Huntington of Lebanon , E. Marston of Mystic Bridge and O. Doty of Stonington . The National Historic Register of Places nomination notes , " the cemetery is significant artistically because the carving on the stones gives many good examples of the funerary art that was characteristic of the 18th and 19th centuries in New England . " The cemetery is notable because of the burial of Isaac C. Glasko , the namesake of the village of Glasgo , and a prominent African American land @-@ holding man who ran a blacksmith shop that was important to the marine industry of the area . The cemetery was made apart of the Connecticut Freedom Trail in 1995 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 12 , 2001 .

 Established around 1713 , the Kinne Cemetery is one of eighteen family cemeteries in Griswold . It rests upon the land of Joseph Kinne , who came to Griswold from Salem , Massachusetts in 1704 and includes the land of Thomas Kinne , also came from Salem in 1714 . The exact date of its founding is unknown , but the earliest extant stone is for Daniel Kinne , died 1713 . According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination , the cemetery was an active burial site for the Kinne family , including those of married Kinne daughters , until the interment of Clark Robbins Cook in 1912 . However , the Hale Index lists the last marked interment as that of Herbert Kinney , died August 24 , 1916 . 
 In order to improve and enlarge the cemetery , the Kinne Historical and Genealogical Society was incorporated by special act of the Connecticut General Assembly in 1884 . In 1887 , the land adjacent to the Glasgo Pond was purchased by the society , though the boundary of 168 feet ( 51 m ) by 170 feet ( 52 m ) does not match the town 's record . The land 's grantor , Nathan B. Lewis , purchased the land thirty years prior in 1857 from a Kinne family connection , Alexander Steward . According to the Town of Griswold 's records , the property is designated as " map 78 , block 136 , lot 3 " . In the 1930s , the inscriptions of 79 stones in the Kinne Cemetery were recorded for the Hale Index . According to another study , 71 of the 74 interments are related by blood or marriage to the Kinne family . 
 In the Summer of 1999 , a group of volunteers worked to restore and clean up the cemetery that led to a ceremony in October 1999 with more than 60 people in attendance . The article in The Day highlighted the difficulty in finding the cemetery which is located on the banks of the Pachaug River , in the village of Glasgo , located in the town of Griswold . Iva <unk> said that the town would repair the stone walls and that the Children of the American Revolution would return in the spring to continue their work on the cemetery . In 2002 , the cemetery had undergone a significant restoration which included the unearthing and accounting for all the burial markers that had been strewn about the grounds . <unk> noted that some of the stones showed signs of vandalism . The Day described how some of the marker stones and monuments were covered in nearly a foot of pine needles and that the roots had uprooted the anchor stones causing the headstones to fall and break . 
 By 2007 , concerns about public use of the land for recreation and reflection had provoked concern from Kinne descendents , but there is little that descendents could do . The grounds were once under the control of the Kinne Family Historical Society , but it was disbanded " generations ago " and the town owns the cemetery by default . The cemetery had been disturbed by the gravestones being stacked to " help climbers reach their optimum height before swinging " from a rope on a tree into the pond . Pieces of the wall and a gravestone had been thrown towards the pond and came to rest on a ledge . Courtland Kinne , a descendent of Thomas Kinne , wants a jersey barrier erected to stop vehicles from parking next to the gravestones , the wrought iron fence around the burial ground and the trees within the grounds to be removed because their roots could disturb the plots .

Glasko ( 1776 @-@ 1861 ) who was " of mixed Indian and Negro blood . " The listing here is not complete because the records of many field stones were incomplete and did not contain identification , including the earliest stone for Daniel Kinne who died in 1713 . Kinne 's stone only had the name carved .

 = Frank Lapidus = 
 Frank J. Lapidus is a fictional character on the ABC television series Lost played by Jeff Fahey . Frank is introduced in the second episode of season four as a pilot hired on a mission to the island where Oceanic Flight 815 crashed . He aids the survivors of the crash against mercenary Martin Keamy ( Kevin Durand ) and helps to rescue a group who become known as the Oceanic Six . Three years later , Frank encounters the group again while working as a commercial airline pilot . His plane lands back on the island , and he is forcibly taken in by a group of his passengers headed by Ilana ( Zuleikha Robinson ) and Bram ( Brad William Henke ) , who are working for the island 's highest authority figure Jacob ( Mark Pellegrino ) . In the series finale , he ultimately escapes the island with a few of his fellow inhabitants . 
 Frank 's name was created by co @-@ executive producer Edward Kitsis , who had been pitching the name " Lapidus " for years and had also used it for an unseen character in the episode " Exposé " . Fahey was the producers ' first choice for the role , which was developed to suit his personality . As a result of the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , Frank 's role in the first half of season four was diminished , and some planned storylines were carried over into the fifth season . Frank 's introduction , along with the three other new characters from the freighter introduced in season four , was well received , as was his return in season five . Lost executive producer Damon Lindelof confirmed in an interview that Lapidus would be a series regular for the show 's sixth and final season . 
 = = Arc = = 
 Originally from The Bronx , New York , Frank was the intended pilot of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 , which crashed on an island in the South Pacific . He is first encountered in The Bahamas , ringing the NTSB to state that the body of the pilot of Flight 815 shown on the sea bed , on the Television news , is not who it is claimed to be . Frank is later recruited as a pilot on behalf of Charles Widmore ( Alan Dale ) , who is chartering a freighter destined for the island upon which Flight 815 crashed . Frank reveals himself to be a conspiracy theorist who believes there are still survivors of Flight 815 . He goes on to pilot a helicopter from the freighter to the island , which malfunctions on approach . His team — consisting of Daniel Faraday ( Jeremy Davies ) , Charlotte Lewis ( Rebecca Mader ) and Miles Straume ( Ken Leung ) — parachute to safety , and Frank is able to land the helicopter without incurring significant damage . Lapidus identifies Juliet Burke ( Elizabeth Mitchell ) as a " local " and in response to the return of Charlotte , who was being held hostage by John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) , flies Desmond Hume ( Henry Ian Cusick ) and Sayid Jarrah ( Naveen Andrews ) to the freighter . 
 Later , Frank disagrees with the actions of fellow freighter passenger Martin Keamy ( Kevin Durand ) , a mercenary hired to capture island inhabitant Benjamin Linus ( Michael Emerson ) . He helps a group of survivors avoid Keamy 's team , and later attempts to resist Keamy 's command . When Keamy murders the freighter 's captain ( Grant Bowler ) in a display of power , he is forced to comply , but is able to secretly transfer a satellite phone to the survivors as a warning . When a group of survivors overpower Keamy 's mercenaries , Frank attempts to fly them to safety . Due to a lack of fuel , the group — consisting of Lapidus , Sayid , Desmond , Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) , Hugo Reyes ( Jorge Garcia ) , Kate Austen ( Evangeline Lilly ) , Sun @-@ Hwa Kwon ( Yunjin Kim ) and Aaron Littleton — crash into the ocean , where they take to a lifeboat and are later rescued by the Searcher , a ship belonging to Desmond 's girlfriend Penelope Widmore ( Sonya Walger ) . 
 Following their rescue , Frank begins working for Ajira Airways . He encounters the survivors again three years later , while piloting Flight 316 to Guam . Frank realizes the Oceanic Six intend to return to the island , and minutes later , the flight experiences extreme turbulence . Frank and his co @-@ pilot are able to land the plane on the adjacent Hydra Island , although the co @-@ pilot is killed . After gathering the survivors of Flight 316 together , Frank accompanies Sun and Ben to the main island . They meet Christian Shephard ( John Terry ) , who reveals that the remaining survivors have travelled through time to 1977 . Christian instructs them to await the arrival of John Locke , which they do . Sun is determined to remain with Locke and find her husband Jin @-@ Soo Kwon ( Daniel Dae Kim ) , so Frank parts from her , returning to Hydra Island intent on repairing the jet radio to call for help . Upon his return , Frank finds that passenger Ilana ( Zuleikha Robinson ) has found guns on the island and claimed leadership of the group . After he is unable to answer her cryptic question " What lies in the shadow of the statue ? " she attacks him and knocks him out . Frank later regains consciousness in an outrigger , being transported back to the main island by Ilana , Bram ( Brad William Henke ) and three other Flight 316 survivors . He overhears them discussing whether or not he may be a potential " candidate " , though when he asks what he may be a candidate for , they refuse to elaborate . Frank accompanies the group through the jungle to meet up with the island 's native inhabitants The Others , at the foot of the aforementioned statue . 
 In the season six premiere " LA X " , Frank tells Sun that he does not trust Ilana and her men . He then witnesses The Man in Black ( also O 'Quinn ) , who was posing as Locke all along , knock out Richard Alpert , the Others ' ageless advisor . He then participates in the burial of the real Locke . Frank then accompanies Ben , Sun and Ilana to rescue any inhabitant of the attacked Temple . They only rescue Miles . They eventually decide to head for the beach . Frank overhears Miles saying that Ben killed Jacob ( Mark Pellegrino ) . He then tells Ben that he was the original pilot of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 . He is at the beach when Jack , Hurley and Richard arrive . 
 In order to stop the Man in Black from leaving the island , Richard suggests that they destroy the Ajira plane . After Ilana is killed while holding <unk> , Frank goes to the Black Rock with the group in order to get more dynamite . However , Hurley blows up the ship in order to prevent anymore risks ; destroying all the dynamite supplies . After Hurley tells of his plan to talk to the Man in Black and Richard goes with his plan to destroy the plane , Frank joins Hurley , along with Jack , and Sun . Their group then merge with the Man in Black 's camp . 
 Later , Charles Widmore 's second in command , Zoe , arrives at the camp and threatens to destroy the camp with artillery shells if the Man in Black does not give back Desmond . Frank , Jack , Hurley , Sun , and Claire Littleton ( Emilie de Ravin ) go with Sawyer 's plan of betraying the Man in Black by joining Widmore , and they escape from the Man in Black 's group . After Jack leaves the group , due to his reluctance to leave the island , the remaining group reach Hydra Island . However , Widmore betrays them , and has them locked in the animal cages at Hydra Station . The Man in Black attacks Widmore 's camp as the Smoke Monster ; allowing Jack , who has joined the Man in Black , to free Frank and the rest of the group . They then head to the Ajira plane to leave the island . But when they get to the plane , the Man in Black reveals the plane is rigged with C4 . He then suggests they leave the island by Widmore 's submarine . 
 Frank and the group reach the sub , and they take control of it . After betraying the Man in Black , Widmore 's men attack , but they manage to submerge . Jack then discovers the Man in Black planted the C4 in Jack 's bag . Sayid sacrifices himself and runs off with the C4 as far away from the others as he could until it explodes . The explosion causes the submarine to sink , and Frank is knocked out after a door hits him . Frank revives and makes it to the surface of the water . He is found by Richard and Miles as they head for Hydra Island to blow up the Ajira plane . Frank convinces them to steal the plane and let him fly it . After much repair work and picking up Kate , Claire , and Sawyer , the plane takes off and heads for home .

 After Naomi Dorrit ( Marsha Thomason ) landed on the island in season three , the producers began to plan who else would be on the boat she came from . They wanted these new characters to be interested in finding the island for their own personal reasons . The team created consisted of Frank , Daniel Faraday , Charlotte Lewis and Miles Straume , referred to as the " freighter folk " . Their relationship with the survivors of Flight 815 formed the crux of the fourth season . Co @-@ executive producer / writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name " Lapidus " for years , finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus . Unsatisfied , Kitsis developed the character " Frank Lapidus , Helicopter Pilot " . According to producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse , Jeff Fahey " was the first and only choice for the role " . Cuse had enjoyed Fahey 's roles in The Lawnmower Man and The Marshal , and he and Lindelof commended his " intense eyes " , stating that " he has exactly the right sensibilities " for the part . Fahey was offered the part without having to audition . At the time the producers began to consider him for the role , he had taken a break from acting and was living in Afghanistan , doing charity work and running an orphanage in Kabul . When Cuse contacted him about appearing in the show , Fahey was on the top of a mountain in Caracas , Venezuela during a rainstorm , having just opened an orphanage . He had never seen the series before , but the producers talked him through the first three seasons in an attempt to convince him to return to acting and accept the role . When he was cast , Fahey was unaware of whether he would be a guest star , or would develop into a regular . Focus on the character was diminished by the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , which resulted in the fourth season being cut short . The latter half of the season did feature the character more predominately , however some stories planned for Frank and his fellow freighter folk had to be deferred to the fifth season . 
 Frank was not originally envisioned with a beard , however at the time of his casting , Fahey himself had one . Lindelof and Cuse felt that the beard worked with Lapidus ' character , and allowed Fahey to keep it for the role , with the requirement he shave it back to a more manageable length . The character remained bearded until his return in fifth season episode " 316 " , set three years on from his original introduction . Fahey praised the way the character was developed to suit him , explaining that upon meeting with Lindelof and Cuse , rather than discussing the show with him , they were more interested in him personally and his experiences , going on to incorporate elements of himself into Lapidus . He expanded : " The beauty of this is they 'll feed you a concept based on an idea of who you are . The actor and the characters are not suits off the rack , they tailor @-@ make them to you . What 's very exciting is it is a very positive give and take . It 's a nice dance , as it were . " Fahey was not given an overarching overview of his character , nor were any of the other new freighter folk , which he found exciting , creating a level of intrigue amongst the cast and crew as well as fans . Prior to arrival on the island , Lapidus was described by Naomi as a drunk . Entertainment Weekly 's Kristin Dos Santos deemed Lapidus the most laid back of the four new characters , though Fahey commented that " It might be because he 's just rolled around a few more places a little longer than the others " , agreeing with Dos Santos ' assessment that Lapidus was " a little nomadic " . Lindelof and Cuse have said that Frank " never takes anything at face value [ and is ] a true conspiracy nut [ who ] has probably seen every episode of The X @-@ Files , [ which will ] pay off for him " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Producers Lindelof and Cuse were initially worried about how the freighter folk characters would be received by fans , after the unhappy reaction to new characters Nikki ( Kiele Sanchez ) and Paulo ( Rodrigo Santoro ) , introduced in season three . However , following their introduction in " Confirmed Dead " , the four characters were well received , with Paige Albiniak of the New York Post citing them as a reason behind the show 's improved ratings . Erin Martell of AOL 's TV Squad wrote that within one episode Fahey had already won her over , and called Frank her favorite new Lost character . IGN 's Chris Carabott described Frank , as well as the other new characters from the freighter , as " great " and " exciting " , writing that : " Fahey 's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent . " TV Guide 's Bruce Fretts praised the casting of the freighter folk , noting that Fahey had been a personal favourite of his since his appearance in The Marshall . He deemed the group all stronger actors than former Lost stars Michelle Rodriguez , Rodrigo Santoro , Maggie Grace and Ian Somerhalder , and expressed hope that they would remain on the show longer . Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called the new characters " fascinating " and wrote that they " totally worked for me , while their intriguing backstories left me <unk> for more . " Peter Mucha of The Philadelphia Inquirer deemed Frank 's flashback " mind @-@ bending " , and Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called " Confirmed Dead " the " perfect introduction " to the new characters , writing that he could not wait to find out more about them . Michael Ausiello of TV Guide also enjoyed their introduction , and praised the actors ' performances . Casey Gillis for The News & Advance highlighted the introduction of the freighter folk as one of the highlights of the season , opining that they " fit seamlessly into the ensemble " , while Digital Spy 's Ben Rawson @-@ Jones praised the season for introducing Frank , who he deemed " a real cult figure . " In contrast , James Poniewozik of Time was critical of Lapidus . He wrote that he was amazed by the economy and precision with which the new characters were introduced because " Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island , and yet by the end of the episode , I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals . " He appended , however , that this was : " with the possible exception of Frank , who seems a bit too generic @-@ drunk @-@ hippie @-@ guy for now . " 
 Following the episode " Something Nice Back Home " , TV Guide 's Trish <unk> noted that she was intrigued by Lapidus ' " seemingly heroic antics " in saving a group of the survivors from Keamy and his men , though overall was confused by the motivations of the freighter folk . Carabott wrote that Frank 's return in the fifth season episode " 316 " was shocking , but seemed as though it was meant to be . He opined that : " The chances of Frank being on that plane are astronomical and the fact that he was supposed to be the pilot of Flight 815 just makes the situation all the more unusual . His appearance in this episode is absurd but after four and a half seasons of Lost it makes perfect sense . " James Yates of the Staten Island Advance wrote that it was " great " to see Frank again , as he had missed the character 's presence , and hoped he would play a major part upon returning to the island .

 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ( Japanese : ソニック ・ ザ ・ <unk> ( ツー ) , Hepburn : Sonikku za Hejjihoggu Tsū ) is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team , with assistance from Sega Technical Institute , and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console . It was released worldwide in November 1992 . The game is the second main entry in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , and the first to feature Miles " Tails " Prower , a flying two @-@ tailed fox . He and protagonist Sonic the Hedgehog must stop the series antagonist Dr. Ivo Robotnik from stealing the Chaos Emeralds in order to power his space station , called the Death Egg . 
 Development of the game began in November 1991 , two months later than originally intended , because Sega of America felt that it was too soon for a sequel . Both American and Japanese Sonic Team staff contributed to development ; art director Tim Skelly designed the appearance of the game 's new 3D special stages , based on an earlier tech demo created by Yuji Naka . The staff increased the speed of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in comparison to its predecessor . As with the original game , the soundtrack was composed by Masato Nakamura . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a critical and commercial success . It has sold over six million copies , making it the second @-@ best @-@ selling Genesis game behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog . It has since been released in several compilations and downloads for various platforms , which were also generally positively received . A remastered version was released on iOS and Android devices in December 2013 , including new features such as Boss Rush and Time Attack modes , and the ' Hidden Palace Zone ' , which was scrapped from the original 1992 release . Two sequels , Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles , were released in 1994 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game 's two protagonists are Sonic the Hedgehog and his sidekick , Miles " Tails " Prower ; Tails is described as having idolized Sonic as a child and wanting to keep up with him . The game 's premise is similar to that of the original Sonic the Hedgehog . Sonic 's nemesis , Dr. Ivo Robotnik , is planning world domination with his army of robots , which he has placed animals inside , and the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds . However , this time he is constructing an armored space station known as the Death Egg . The goal of the game is to defeat Robotnik , optionally saving as many animals as possible and collecting all seven Emeralds . By default , the game ends with Sonic riding on Tails ' biplane , the Tornado . However , if the player has collected all of the Chaos Emeralds , Sonic , in his Super Sonic form , flies alongside it .

 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a 2D , side @-@ scrolling platform game . At the game 's start , the player can select to either play as Sonic , Tails , or both . In the latter mode , players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him . A second player can join in at any time and control Tails separately . The game takes place over a series of levels , each divided into one , two , or three acts with a boss fight with Robotnik at the end of the last act . The character can jump on enemies to defeat them ; the game also introduces a new move , the " spin dash " or " Super Dash Attack " , by which the player curls in a ball and spins while stationary , resulting in a speed boost . When the player is attacked by an enemy without rings , is crushed , falls off @-@ screen , or exceeds the act 's ten @-@ minute limit , they lose a life and return to the most recently passed checkpoint . Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over . 
 When the player collects at least 50 rings and passes a checkpoint , they can warp to a " special stage " . In these stages , the player runs through a pseudo @-@ 3D half @-@ pipe course , collecting rings and dodging bombs . A set amount of rings must be collected to pass through each of three checkpoints and in turn to obtain the emerald itself . If Sonic collides with a bomb , he loses ten rings and is immobilized momentarily . The stages rise in difficulty , and the player cannot enter any stage without passing the previous one . After finishing , the player is transported back to the star post they used to enter the special stage . When all Emeralds have been collected , if the player chose Sonic , he has the ability to turn into Super Sonic , which requires 50 rings or more . Super Sonic is yellow and invincible to enemy attacks , and his speed , acceleration , and jump height are increased as well . However , he loses one ring per second and reverts to being regular Sonic when all of his rings are gone . 
 The game also has a competitive mode , where two players compete against each other to the finish line , as either Sonic or Tails , in a split @-@ screen race through three of the regular levels and a special stage . After one player finishes one of the regular levels , the other player must finish the zone within 60 seconds , or the level ends instantly . In the regular levels , players are ranked in five areas ( score , time , rings held at the end of the level , total rings collected , and number of item boxes broken ) . The player with wins in the most number of categories , wins the level . In the Special Stage , players compete to obtain the most rings . The mode ends when all stages have been completed , or if a player loses all their lives , in which their opponent will automatically win . 
 = = = Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 = = = 
 Sonic & Knuckles was released in 1994 , two years after Sonic 2 . The Sonic & Knuckles game cartridge features a special " lock @-@ on " adapter by which the player can attach other Genesis cartridges . Attaching Sonic 2 unlocks Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 , a variation of Sonic 2 whereby the player plays as Knuckles the Echidna , a character introduced in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 ( 1994 ) and not playable until Sonic & Knuckles . 
 Though the game is largely identical to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 , Knuckles may glide and climb walls , allowing him access to new areas . He cannot jump as high , making some areas , such as certain boss fights , more difficult . Fewer rings are needed to progress in special stages and the score made within them no longer resets . The two @-@ player mode is removed . 
 = = Development = = 
 Following the release of the original Sonic the Hedgehog , creator Yuji Naka quit Sega due to disagreements over its corporate policies . Mark Cerny , who had recently founded the Sega Technical Institute ( STI ) at Sega of America , met with Naka in Japan and offered him a higher salary and more creative freedom if he joined STI . Naka agreed , and Hirokazu Yasuhara , lead level designer of Sonic the Hedgehog , also decided to move to STI . Yasuhara had been assigned to help Cerny establish STI in 1990 , but the outbreak of the Gulf War delayed his move to the United States by three months , during which he joined Sonic Team and became part of the Sonic project . 
 Development of Sonic 2 began in November 1991 , two months later than Cerny had intended , because Sega of America initially felt it was too soon for a sequel . Both American and Japanese Sonic Team staff contributed to development ; art director Tim Skelly designed the appearance of the game 's pseudo @-@ 3D special stages , based on a tech demo created by Naka . The special stages were created out of pre @-@ rendered 3D polygons , video of which was compressed and halved , both vertically and horizontally , to fit in the game cartridge . Sonic 2 also introduced Sonic 's sidekick , a two @-@ tailed flying fox named Tails , inspired by Japanese folklore about the kitsune and created by level artist Yasushi Yamaguchi . Sega of America objected to the character 's name , Miles Prower ( a pun on " miles per hour " ) , so he was given the nickname Tails as a compromise . Masaharu Yoshii served as the game 's director . The staff increased the speed of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 compared to the first game . 
 The game was originally believed to contain time travel elements and also have a port to the Mega @-@ CD / Sega CD , Sega 's add @-@ on for the Genesis . The port never surfaced , and time travel was instead implemented in an original Sonic game for the Mega CD , Sonic the Hedgehog CD . 
 A demonstration cartridge of the game was stolen at a New York toy show earlier in 1992 . Sega 's Akinori Nishiyama stated that the leak was due to the lack of security . The prototype features a playable section of a level titled " Hidden Palace Zone " , a level cut shortly before release . Naka said of the level : 
 The basic idea was about the same as it was in Sonic & Knuckles . You 'd encounter the stage through normal play by collecting the emeralds . The idea behind the stage was , " Where do the Chaos Emeralds come from ? " That 's where Sonic was originally supposed to be granted his Super Sonic powers . We finally were able to use it in S & K , though it wound up being quite different from what we had planned in Sonic 2 . But even from Sonic 1 we 'd been throwing around those sorts of ideas . Still , when we were running out of time , we looked over things quickly trying to figure out what to dump ... and CHOP went the Hidden Palace . There 's simply no way we could have thrown that in by the deadline at the rate we were going . 
 The " Hidden Palace " level was lost for over 20 years until it was included in the iOS remaster release in December 2013 , which implemented the level . Sega provided some magazines , such as GamePro , with screenshots of early builds of the game that showed another removed level ; a desert themed level , named " Dust Hill Zone " . Naka has also alluded to another , unidentified , scrapped level in the Sonic Jam Official Strategy Guide , explaining why the " Metropolis Zone " had three parts to it , while every other level only had two : " Due to problems with the story , Act 3 was going to be a different Zone that would only appear once , but since it was cut , we still wanted to have something after Act 2 . So that 's why there are three acts in this one . We had already finished the map , and it would have been a shame to waste it , so this is what we went with . " 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 's music , like the previous game , was composed by Masato Nakamura , bassist and lead songwriter of the J @-@ pop band Dreams Come True . The music began early on in development with only concept images for Nakamura 's reference , but having a previous game meant he had experience with creating music for the Genesis , and began taking a similar approach to the first game . Nakamura treated Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as a film , and designed the music around the atmosphere that he felt from the images of the stages . Except for the graphics and some discussion with Sonic Team , Nakamura was given freedom over the music creation which he believes was the reason why he was able to create " such melodic tunes and unusual rhythm patterns " . 
 Nakamura created the music while he was recording with Dreams Come True in London , working on their fourth album The Swinging Star . As a gift to Sonic Team , Masato produced an alternate version of the ending theme with Dreams Come True , which was included in the album they were recording at the time . In 2011 , the stage music from Chemical Plant and Casino Night Zone were remixed by Sega for use in Sonic Generations . 
 Later in October of the same year , a three @-@ disc compilation of the music from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released in Japan . Alongside music from the game , the compilation includes comments by Yuji Naka and an interview with Nakamura . The first disc contains original tracks from both games , and the second contains Nakamura 's demo recordings produced during the games ' development . The third disc contains " Sweet Sweet Sweet " by Dreams Come True , its English @-@ language version " Sweet Dream " , and 2006 remixes of both songs by singer Akon which were used in Sonic the Hedgehog ( 2006 ) .

 Sega launched a $ 10 million advertising campaign for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 's release . Sega sought a global release date to make the game available in all stores on the same day , a fairly novel concept at the time . This required Sega to reconfigure its distribution system to ensure that games were available in all major stores . The release date , Tuesday , November 24 , 1992 was marketed as " Sonic 2s day " . While the Genesis release in North America and the Mega Drive release in Europe both released the game on this day , Sega made the game available a few days before in Japan on November 21 , 1992 . 400 @,@ 000 copies of Sonic 2 were sold in the first seven days after release and over 6 million in the life span of the console .

 Due to the popularity of its predecessor , Sonic the Hedgehog 2 already had an established fanbase anticipating its release . The game received critical acclaim upon release and was a best seller in the UK charts for 2 months . As of 2006 , the game has sold over 6 million copies , making it the second best @-@ selling game for the Sega Genesis ( after the original Sonic the Hedgehog ) . 
 Reviewers praised the game for its large levels , colorful graphics and backgrounds , increased cast of characters , enemies , and music . GameSpot stated that " time may have eroded Sega 's prominence , but it hasn 't done much to diminish how sweet Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is , " and , along with other reviewers , commented on how it is still a fun game to play . Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it as the best Sega Genesis game of 1992 . In 2000 , Game Informer ranked Sonic 2 number 61 on its " Top 100 Games of All Time " list , calling it " the most challenging and finely polished Sonic the Hedgehog title . " Mega placed the game at # 36 in their " Top Sega Mega Drive Games of All Time " list . Critics also enjoyed the faster gameplay the game offered in comparison to its predecessor , as well as its new features . Lucas Thomas of IGN praised the new " Spin @-@ Dash " ability , which would prepare Sonic to launch at a faster speed . Thomas also noted that the levels of Sonic 2 were designed to showcase the character 's speed , and was less a " platform @-@ jumping game " than a " platform @-@ running " game , in slight contrast to its predecessor . 
 The game 's main criticisms were of the two player mode , a new introduction to the series . The game allowed two @-@ player mode in three different zones ( Emerald Hill , Casino Night and Mystic Cave ) . Reviewers criticized the mode 's noticeable slowdown and prominent flickering , and the squashed play area for each player . However , Lucas Thomas praised the innovation of the new two player mode , quipping that " Mario and Luigi could never run competitively through the same levels , at the same time " . William Burrill of the Toronto Star described the two player racing mode as the " only part of the game that can be faulted , " citing that the mode and its split screen view " squeezes the graphics , <unk> up the characters and slows down the action . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 's financial success was a major factor in Sega catching up to Nintendo in the early @-@ 1990s console wars . It brought their market share up to 50 % within six months of its release . Tails , whom Sonic the Hedgehog 2 introduced , would go on to become one of the most prominent and frequently recurring characters in the series , appearing and acting as Sonic 's sidekick in most of the franchise 's media , including in recent games such as Sonic Colors , Sonic Generations , and Sonic Lost World in which most of the recurring cast does not appear or is relegated to minor roles . Tails starred alone in two games for the Sega Game Gear : Tails ' <unk> and Tails Adventure . Furthermore , Sonic the Hedgehog 2 's popularity managed extend its own cult following and spawn various merchandise such as comic books ( the well @-@ received fortnightly Sonic the Comic ) , a television series , and a sequel , Sonic the Hedgehog 3 , which received similar acclaim . 
 For Sonic 's twentieth anniversary , Sega released Sonic Generations , a game that remade aspects of various past games from the franchise . The PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , and PC versions contained a remade " Chemical Plant " level . It also contained a remake of the final boss fight , the Death Egg Robot , as the Classic Era boss of the game . Separately , the Nintendo 3DS version of the game contained a remake of the " Casino Night " level . A " Casino Night " themed pinball minigame was made available for download as a pre @-@ order bonus for the console versions at GameStop . 
 = Shivalik @-@ class frigate = 
 The Shivalik class or Project 17 class is a class of multi @-@ role frigates in service with the Indian Navy . They are the first stealth warships built in India . A total of three ships were built between 2000 and 2010 , and all three were in commission by 2012 . 
 The Shivalik class , along with the seven Project 17A frigates currently being developed from them , are projected be the principal frigates of the Indian Navy in the first half of the 21st century . All ships of the class were built by Mazagon Dock Limited . The class and the lead vessel have been named for the Shivalik hills . Subsequent vessels in the class are also named for hill @-@ ranges in India . 
 Originally conceived as a successor to the Talwar @-@ class frigates , the Shivalik @-@ class frigates feature improved stealth features and land attacking capabilities . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Project 17 was conceived in the 1990s to meet the Indian Navy 's need for a class of stealthy frigates that were to be designed and built in India . The Directorate of Naval Design ( DND ) ' s specifications for the project called for a class of " 5000 ton stealth frigates ( Project 17 ) incorporating advanced signature suppression and signature management features " . The first three units were formally ordered by the Indian Navy in early 1999 . 
 Shivalik 's design embodies many firsts in Indian ships . Shivalik is the first Indian naval vessel to use a combined diesel or gas ( CODOG ) propulsion system . The CODOG gearboxes were designed and built by <unk> Engineering . 
 The main features of the class are its stealth characteristics and land @-@ attack capability . The ships incorporate structural , thermal and acoustic stealth features . The vessels use 10 gigabit LAN for their network . 
 There has also been an increased emphasis on crew comfort in this class of ships with more spacious accommodation being provided . Also , INS Shivalik is the first ship in the Indian Navy with <unk> and dosa @-@ makers on board .

 Twilight Zone : 19 Original Stories on the 50th Anniversary is a collection of short stories written by various authors and edited by Carol Serling , the widow of series creator Rod Serling . Each story was written with themes or styles similar to The Twilight Zone episodes , including narrated introductions and conclusions to each story . Authors who contributed a story include Twilight Zone veteran Earl Hamner , Alan Brennert and William F. Wu , and a previously unpublished story by Rod Serling . Reviewers listed some of the better stories as being Kelley Armstrong 's " A Haunted House of Her Own " , Alan Brennert 's " Puowaina " and Mike Resnick and <unk> Robyn 's " <unk> " . 
 = = Background = = 
 This anthology of short stories was published to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the television debut of The Twilight Zone . Since the death of her husband , The Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling , Carol Serling had been acting as a consultant for a series of fiction anthologies and for the 1983 theatrical film . She contributed to or edited books including Journeys to the Twilight Zone , Adventures in the Twilight Zone , Return to the Twilight Zone , More Stories from the Twilight Zone , and the non @-@ fiction book Rod Serling and The Twilight Zone : The 50th Anniversary Tribute . Among the authors solicited to write stories for the 50th anniversary book were Alan Brennert and William F. Wu , who worked on the 1980s The Twilight Zone series ; Earl Hamner , who wrote episodes for the original series ; and Rod Serling 's older brother , Robert J. Serling . Peter S. Beagle and Harlan Ellison were advertised as contributors but their stories did not make it into the book . 
 = = Synopsis and format = = 
 The book begins with an introduction by the editor Carol Serling and ends with brief biographies of all the authors . Each of the 19 self @-@ contained short stories includes an introduction and conclusion with the same tone and style as Rod Serling 's narration at the beginning and end of each Twilight Zone episode . 
 Adam Balm on Ain 't It Cool News categorized the short stories into following four basic types of The Twilight Zone episode formats : the social revenge fantasies ( " The Art of Miniature " , " Family Man " , and " The Good Neighbor " ) use unlikable characters who eventually suffer an ironic twist to their predicament ; stories about paranoid characters trying to convince others that something is wrong ( " The Street that Forgot Time " ) ; stories with a war theme ( " Genesis " , " Puowaina " , " Ghost Writer " , and " The Soldier He Needed to Be " ) ; and stories centered on a hitch @-@ hiker ( " On the Road " and " Truth or Consequences " ) . 
 = = Publication and reception = = 
 The book was published by Tor Books as a hardcover and paperback in September 2009 . To help with its promotion a 39 second video trailer was produced . Compared to Rod Serling and The Twilight Zone : The 50th Anniversary Tribute , which was reviewed by writer Elizabeth Hand as " a piece of hagiography that does little to illuminate Serling 's genius or the enduring appeal of his most famous creation " , the anthology was called " a far superior homage to Serling " . In her Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction column Hand listed Hagberg 's " Genesis " are the best story in the anthology though Lansdale 's and Stine 's are also good . She called Rod Serling 's and <unk> 's stories " the only real misfires " . 
 The review in Publishers Weekly listed Armstrong 's " A Haunted House of Her Own " , Brennert 's " Puowaina " , and Tad Williams 's " Ants " as the best stories . The review also listed Wu 's " On the Road " , Douglas 's " Truth or Consequences " , and Serling 's " Ghost Writer " as being " less satisfying " stories . The review concluded that the book is " largely inoffensive and faithful to the Twilight Zone format , this anthology is primarily of interest to hardcore fans " . Carl Hays from Booklist wrote a positive review , saying " superior craftsmanship ensures can 't @-@ miss entertainment for speculative @-@ fiction fans and anyone nostalgic for the original Twilight Zone aura " . Impressed by the authors , the reviewer in the Library Journal wrote " with this slate of authors and the perennial popularity of the show , all libraries should own a copy " . 
 The Starlog reviewer , David McDonnell , lists the anthology 's best stories as Lansdale 's " Torn Away " , Zahn 's " <unk> ' Down the Avenue " , Resnick and Robyn 's " <unk> " , and Armstrong 's " A Haunted House of Her Own " . McDonnell noted that Rod Serling 's " El Moe " was least like a typical Twilight Zone story , and that Williams 's " Ants " belonged to the Alfred Hitchcock Presents universe rather than The Twilight Zone . On Ain 't It Cool News , Adam Balm identified Wu 's " On the Road " as " the best entry in the collection " . Balm wrote that the anthology is " uneven , with too many stories disappointing and too many that are <unk> remember @-@ <unk> , mining territory long since tamed and settled by others " but ultimately worth the money spent . 
 = Invasion of the Cape Colony ( 1795 ) = 
 The Invasion of the Cape Colony was a British military expedition launched in 1795 against the Dutch Cape Colony at the Cape of Good Hope , the southern tip of Southern Africa . The Dutch colony at the Cape , established in the seventeenth century , was at the time the only viable South African port for ships making the journey from Europe to the European colonies in the East Indies . It therefore held vital strategic importance , although it was otherwise economically insignificant . In the winter of 1794 , during the French Revolutionary Wars , French troops captured the Dutch Republic , which was reformed into the client state of the Batavian Republic . In response , Great Britain launched operations against the Dutch Empire to prevent the use of its facilities by the French Navy . 
 The British expedition was led by Vice @-@ Admiral Sir George Keith Elphinstone and sailed in April 1795 , arriving off Simon 's Town at the Cape in June . Attempts were made to negotiate a settlement with the colony , but talks achieved nothing and an amphibious landing was made on 7 August . A short battle was fought at Muizenberg , and skirmishing between British and Dutch forces continued until September when a larger military force landed . With Cape Town under threat , Dutch Governor Abraham Josias Sluysken surrendered the colony . Elphinstone subsequently strengthened the garrison against counterattack and stationed a Royal Navy squadron off the port . Almost a year later a Dutch reinforcement convoy reached the colony only to find that it was badly outnumbered , and surrendered without a fight . The British Cape Colony continued until the Peace of Amiens in 1802 when it was returned to the Dutch . In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars a second British invasion recaptured the colony after the Battle of Blaauwberg and it remained a British colony until the establishment of the Union of South Africa in 1910 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The French Revolutionary Wars , which began in 1792 following the French Revolution , expanded in January 1793 when the French Republic declared war on the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of Great Britain . This brought the war to the Indian Ocean , where both Britain and the Netherlands maintained lucrative empires . Trade from these empires was menaced by French privateers and warships operating from Île de France , ( now Mauritius ) but it was protected in the waters off Southern Africa by the presence of the Dutch Cape Colony . Situated at the Cape of Good Hope , the Cape Colony had been established in the seventeenth century to offer a harbour for shipping traveling between Europe and the East Indies , and in the 1790s it remained the only such station between Rio de Janeiro and British India . 
 The Cape Colony was administered from two towns , the larger Cape Town on the wide Table Bay facing west and smaller Simon 's Town on False Bay facing south . Neither bay was sheltered from Atlantic storms and both were notoriously dangerous , with winds , currents and rocks posing considerable threats to shipping . Beyond its importance as a resupply port for East Indies shipping the colony had little economic value in the 1790s , and was defended by a garrison of approximately 1 @,@ 000 Dutch regular soldiers supplemented by Boer militia and local Khoikhoi units , commanded by General Abraham Josias Sluysken and Colonel Robert Jacob Gordon , in total around 3 @,@ 600 troops . This garrison was centered on the Castle of Good Hope and operated from a series of coastal fortifications which protected Table Bay . False Bay was more weakly defended , covered by only two lightly armed batteries . 
 In the winter of 1794 , French soldiers invaded the Netherlands and captured Amsterdam . The French National Convention reconstituted the Dutch Republic into a revolutionary client state named the Batavian Republic , although the Stadtholder William of Orange fled to Britain . There he issued the Kew Letters instructing his colonial governors to cooperate with British occupation forces . At the urging of Sir Francis Baring , the Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas authorised a mission to ensure control of the Cape Colony and eliminate the potential threat it posed to the East Indian trade . The Admiralty sent two battle squadrons to the Cape on 3 April 1795 , one under Vice @-@ Admiral Sir George Keith Elphinstone and the other under Commodore John Blankett , carrying a small expeditionary force of 515 soldiers from the 78th Regiment of Foot under Major @-@ General Sir James Henry Craig . A larger force under General Alured Clarke was instructed to follow these squadrons on 15 May with troops and supplies for a longer campaign , with orders to hold at Salvador until requested . 
 = = Invasion = = 
 Blankett and Elphinstone united off the Cape on 10 June 1795 and anchored in Simon 's Bay . There messages were sent to Sluysken offering an alliance against the French . The Dutch governor was inclined to resist however , evacuating the civilian population from Simon 's Town in early July and making preparations to raze the town . To prevent this , Craig landed 800 soldiers and Royal Marines on 14 July , who occupied Simon 's Town while the Dutch withdrew to the pass at Muizenberg , through which passed the road to Cape Town . For the next month the two armies observed an uneasy truce , broken by occasional patrols and sniping . During this period , Elphinstone and Sluysken continued negotiations for the surrender of the colony . These negotiations were stalled by disputes in the colonial government regarding the legitimacy of the deposed William of Orange and suspicion concerning British intentions . While the debates continued , British envoys were permitted free movement in Cape Town , making detailed observations of the defences . 
 Elphinstone became concerned that the Dutch positions were too strong for his forces to overwhelm , and on 19 June he sent HMS Sphinx to request assistance from Clarke 's fleet . On 7 August , with negotiations stalled , Elphinstone ordered an attack on the pass at Muizenberg . Craig 's forces were supplemented with 1 @,@ 000 sailors from Elphinstone 's squadron redeployed on land under Captains Temple Hardy and John William Spranger . Among this force were a number of American citizens who immediately deserted to the Dutch and were promised repatriation . At noon on 7 August HMS America , HMS Stately , HMS Echo and HMS Rattlesnake opened fire on Dutch forward positions . Return fire from Dutch field guns killed two men on America and wounded three more , but Craig 's troops were able to advance against the Dutch positions and seize them , the Dutch defenders falling back in confusion . A second attack by soldiers of the 78th captured a rocky height nearby and a Dutch counterattack the following morning was driven off by Hardy 's sailors and marines . 
 The Dutch fell back to <unk> but British forces were not strong enough to advance , suffering shortages of food and ammunition . Elphinstone 's positions were however improved by reinforcements , which arrived in the Arniston on 9 August , as well as disorganisation in the Dutch command resulting in stalemate . The British commander subsequently authorised the seizure of five Dutch East Indiamen merchant ships at anchor at Simon 's Town on 18 August . Skirmishing continued throughout the month , with stronger Dutch attacks on 1 and 2 September followed by a larger planned assault on Simon 's Town on 3 September in which Sluysken committed all his reserves including 18 cannon . That morning however 14 East India Company ships were seen arriving in Simon 's Bay and the attack was cancelled . These ships were the reinforcement fleet under Clarke , who landed 4 @,@ 000 troops from the 78th , 93rd and 98th Regiments of Foot and a unit from Saint Helena , at Simon 's Town for an overland campaign against Cape Town . Clarke 's army then advanced against Dutch piquets , losing one killed and 17 wounded in skirmishes . To support this operation , Elphinstone sent America , Rattlesnake , Echo and the Indiaman Bombay Castle to blockade Cape Town and provide artillery support . Outnumbered and surrounded , Sluysken requested a 48 @-@ hour truce from Clarke , but was given a 24 @-@ hour ultimatum to surrender . With no alternative , the Dutch governor passed control of his colony to the British on 15 September 1795 , although he allowed approximately 40 British deserters in Cape Town , mostly impressed Americans , to escape into the countryside before the deadline passed .

 = = Aftermath = = 
 Total British losses were four killed and 54 wounded . Captured in Table Bay were the Dutch East Indiaman Castor and the 14 @-@ gun naval brig Star , which was renamed HMS Hope . Elphinstone 's substantial squadron remained on station at the Cape to deter efforts to recapture the colony . Parts of this force were subsequently deployed to bolster British forces in the Indian Ocean . The blockade of Île de France was restored and Arrogant and Victorious were sent to the Dutch East Indies where they would fight an inconclusive battle with a French squadron off Sumatra in September 1796 . Elphinstone himself sailed for Madras , where he received reports that a Dutch force had sailed from the Netherlands to retake the Cape Colony . The admiral returned to Cape Town , assembling a large squadron to await the Dutch arrival . Further reports revealed the strength and progress of the Dutch and Elphinstone had ample time to prepare his squadron for their arrival and increase the garrison ashore . The Dutch Rear @-@ Admiral Engelbertus Lucas spent almost six months on the passage and gathered no intelligence on British defences . Thus when he arrived off the Cape he was soon discovered by Elphinstone in Saldanha Bay and intimidated into surrender without a fight . 
 No further attacks on the Cape Colony were made during the course of the war . Elphinstone returned to Britain in October 1796 and was subsequently awarded the title of Baron Keith for his service in the capture and defence of the Cape , a reward that historian C. Northcote Parkinson calls " on the whole , easily earned " . At the Peace of Amiens in 1802 one of the treaty terms returned the Cape Colony , along with all captured Dutch colonies except Ceylon , to the Batavian Republic . The peace was short @-@ lived , and after the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803 a second British invasion was planned , executed in 1806 and victory secured following the Battle of Blaauwberg . The Cape Colony remained part of the British Empire until its independence as part of a unified South Africa in 1910 .

Lyrically the song speaks of wealthy men hitting on Kesha , trying to buy her attention . 
 The song was later re @-@ released featuring rapper André 3000 . The collaboration came about after Kesha sent him a copy of the track in hopes that he would like it ; they later spoke on the phone and André agreed to appear on the track . André 's verse speaks about a young child dealing with his deadbeat father and also his friendship with Kesha . Critical reception of the song was generally positive with critics citing the song as a strong club number that is influenced by the songs of Jennifer Lopez , Gwen Stefani and Lil Wayne . " Sleazy " charted in both Canada and the United States peaking at forty @-@ six and fifty @-@ one , respectively .

 " Sleazy " is a dance @-@ pop and hip hop song that is three minutes and twenty @-@ five seconds in length . On the song , Kesha criticizes wealthy men who try to buy her attention . It also contains suggestive innuendos such as , " Rat tat tat on your dumb dumb drum , the beat so fat gonna make me come , um um um , over to your place . " Vocally , the song follows in similar form to her previous singles footsteps as Kesha uses her " sing @-@ rap " vocal style present throughout the song . Kesha uses layered vocals that are enhanced in some parts with the use of auto @-@ tune and she sings over a thundering bass line that is combined with a ticking beat as a backing . 
 Production of the song has been cited for drawing influence from multiple songs including ; Gwen Stefani 's " Hollaback Girl " for its " swagga " , Jennifer Lopez 's " Love Don 't Cost a Thing " for its " attitude " , as well as combining " a touch of Lil Wayne 's ' Milli ' " . Josh Langhoff from PopMatters , however , felt that the song followed similar suit to that of MIA .

Nadine Cheung from AOL Radio felt that the song followed similar form to " We R Who We R " , writing : " [ following ] the anthemic lead single , " We R Who We R " [ ... ] [ Sleazy is ] [ i ] n true Kesha form , the Nashville native uses her sing @-@ song rapping style to eschew the luxe life : " I don 't need you or your brand new Benz , or your <unk> [ sic ] friends / I don 't need love lookin ' like diamonds / Lookin ' like diamonds . " Chad Grischow from IGN noted that Kesha 's " ' broke and proud of it ' attitude is a refreshing change for the money flaunting pop landscape " .

 Josh Langhoff of PopMatters noted that though rap may not be her " <unk> " , " you can tell she works hard at it " as she " rattles off a well @-@ constructed string of rapid @-@ fire syllables " Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly recommended " Sleazy " as a downloadable track , commenting it is " a boom @-@ box stomper " .

 After the release of the original remix with André , Kesha and co @-@ producer of the track , Luke , decided that they wanted to remix the track again with the intention of adding some of Kesha 's desired future collaborations . The first to add their verses to the track was Lil Wayne . Kesha and Wayne both happened to be in the studio on the same day as each other and she took the opportunity to ask him if he would participate in the remixing of the song . Following this Wiz Khalifa and T.I. were then asked to collaborate on the track . All three rappers agreed to write and appear on the song and with this the remix was completed . According to Kesha , the four rappers on the remix , titled " Sleazy Remix 2 @.@ 0 : Get <unk> " , are included because they are four of her favorite rappers .

 = Peter Taylor ( footballer , born 1928 ) = 
 Peter Thomas Taylor ( 2 July 1928 – 4 October 1990 ) was an English football player and manager . A goalkeeper with a modest playing career , he went on to work in management alongside Brian Clough at Derby County and Nottingham Forest , winning the Football League with both clubs and the European Cup twice with Nottingham Forest . 
 He began his playing career at Nottingham Forest during World War II , before joining Coventry City in July 1945 . He spent the 1953 – 54 season as Coventry 's first choice goalkeeper , but was otherwise mostly used a reserve player . He was sold on to Middlesbrough for £ 3 @,@ 500 in 1955 , and kept goal for the Second Division club for four full seasons after being promoted to the first team in the 1956 – 57 campaign . He lost his first team place in 1960 , and in June 1961 joined Port Vale for a £ 750 fee . He took a free transfer to non @-@ league Burton Albion in May 1962 , where he ended his playing career . Throughout his playing career he built for his future management career by learning from Coventry manager Harry Storer and building a close relationship with Middlesbrough striker Brian Clough , six years his junior . 
 He was appointed as manager of Burton Albion in October 1962 after impressing the chairman with his knowledge of the game . He built a strong team and led the club to victory in the Southern League Cup in 1964 . In 1965 , Clough appointed him as his assistant at Hartlepools United , and Taylor helped Clough to rebuild the playing squad . The pair moved on to Derby County in May 1967 , taking the club to the Second Division title in 1968 – 69 , then the First Division title in 1971 – 72 , and the semi @-@ finals of the European Cup in 1973 . The duo resigned in October 1973 after their strained relationship with the club 's board of directors became unworkable . Clough and Taylor moved on to Brighton & Hove Albion in November 1973 , and Taylor stayed on as manager after Clough left Brighton in July 1974 . 
 In July 1976 , Taylor left Brighton to work alongside Clough at Nottingham Forest . Repeating their achievement at Derby by winning promotion into the top @-@ flight in 1976 – 77 and then winning the league title in 1977 – 78 , they then surpassed their previous accomplishments by winning the European Cup in 1979 and 1980 . Forest also lifted the Anglo @-@ Scottish Cup , the FA Charity Shield , the European Super Cup , and twice won the League Cup . Taylor retired in May 1982 , but returned to the game in November 1982 to manage Derby County . He retired for the second and final time in April 1984 , though following a dispute over a player transfer in May 1983 he and Clough were not on speaking terms until Taylor 's sudden death in October 1990 – something which Clough would greatly regret . In April 2009 , a statue of Clough and Taylor was commissioned at Derby 's Pride Park Stadium , and in October 2015 Nottingham Forest 's main stand at the City Ground was renamed the Peter Taylor Stand . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 Peter Taylor was born on 2 July 1928 , one of eight children raised in The Meadows , Nottingham , to Tom and Jenny Taylor , an engineer and housewife respectively . He met his future wife Lily Thorpe at the age of 14 , who persuaded him to play for her father 's team , local non @-@ league side Christchurch . He later moved on to play for <unk> Methodists , before he was spotted by Nottingham Forest , and signed to their youth team , the Forest Colts . He made his first team debut for the club as an amateur in a wartime fixture against local rivals Notts County at Meadow Lane in 1944 , at the age of 16 . 
 He signed with Coventry City on his 17th birthday , though was initially only a part @-@ time player as his father insisted that he also complete an apprenticeship in bricklaying . Under the stewardship of Harry Storer , the " Sky Blues " finished seventh in the Second Division in 1950 – 51 , and Taylor made his debut in the Football League on the final day of the season , breaking Alf Wood 's run of 261 consecutive first team appearances . The Birmingham Sports Argus described how " if Peter 's role [ back @-@ up goalkeeper to Wood ] has denied him the glamour of a glorious achievement in action , he has his share of personal glamour . He 's a tall fair @-@ haired good looker , and so comely , that he was been described as the film star of Highfield Road . Is single too . " Taylor did not stay single for long however , and married Lily Thorpe in June 1951 . 
 Coventry were relegated in 1951 – 52 , with Taylor having made 29 appearances . Coventry finished sixth in the Third Division South in 1952 – 53 , with Taylor only appearing eight times . It proved to be Storey 's final season as manager , and Taylor later cited Storer as his managerial mentor , and would go on to quote Storer numerous times throughout his career . Taylor played 42 games as Coventry posted a 14th @-@ place finish under Jack Fairbrother in 1953 – 54 , then played ten matches as they finished ninth in 1954 – 55 . Taylor decided to leave the club after losing his first team place to future Coventry City Hall of Famer and England international Reg Matthews . 
 Taylor was sold to Middlesbrough in the summer of 1955 for £ 3 @,@ 500 by new Coventry manager Jesse Carver , following an assessment of the playing staff by Carver and new coach George Raynor . It was at Middlesbrough that Taylor first met his future managerial partner Brian Clough , who was then fourth @-@ choice striker at Ayresome Park . Taylor spotted Clough 's potential and helped him to achieve a place in the first team . Taylor initially contacted Storer , now manager of Derby County , to try and get him to sign Clough , but Storer had told him he had spent the club 's budget on signing Martin McDonnell and Paddy Ryan . Manager Bob Dennison led " Boro " to 14th in the Second Division in 1955 – 56 , seeing both Clough and Taylor only as " useful reserves " . The pair spent their spare time coaching schoolboys to boost their wages and to gain experience . Clough went on to become the club 's star striker with 197 goals in 213 league games , and though Taylor would also break into the first team after replacing Rolando Ugolini , he later admitted he was only ever an " average goalkeeper " . 
 Bob Dennison , although one of my favourite people , was too unambitious for Brian [ Clough ] , and his staff were in the same easygoing mould . Harold Shepherdson , the England trainer , and coaches like Micky Fenton and Jimmy Gordon were nice men running a pleasant club that treated players decently while getting nowhere " . 
 In June 1961 , Port Vale manager Norman Low paid Middlesbrough £ 750 for Taylor 's services . Largely unneeded at Vale Park , Ken Hancock being a virtual ever @-@ present from 1960 to 1964 , his only appearance was in a 2 – 1 Third Division defeat at Bradford Park Avenue on 3 February 1962 . He left on a free transfer for Burton Albion in May 1962 , where he began his management career .

 = = = Burton Albion = = = 
 In October 1962 , Taylor was offered the manager 's job at Burton Albion after impressing chairman Trevor Grantham with his knowledge and theories on the game . In summer 1963 he oversaw a complete overhaul of the playing staff , only retaining four players , and completely rebuilt the squad . He signed strikers Richie Barker and Stan Round , who would score a combined 308 goals for the club , and remain the club 's two highest goalscorers ( as of 2016 ) . He survived calls for his resignation after a defeat to Kidderminster Harriers in the FA Cup and went on to create one of the most successful sides in Burton 's history , beating Weymouth to win the Southern League Cup in 1964 . In 1965 , he walked out on a newly signed £ 34 a week three @-@ year contract at Burton to became Clough 's assistant manager at Hartlepools United on wages of £ 24 a week . He later admitted the decision , which he took against the advice of his friends and family , was " against all logic " . His successor , Alex Tait , led Burton to promotion out of the Southern League Division One in 1965 – 66 . 
 = = = Hartlepools United = = = 
 Before their arrival , Hartlepools had been forced to apply for re @-@ election to the Football League six times in the previous seven years , and Taylor stated that the squad were all free transfer signings and some of the players struggled with " drink , debt or abandoned wives " . The two gradually turned around the club 's fortunes , and started by painting Victoria Park . Taylor had little chance to show his skills in the transfer market as the club only had £ 7 @,@ 500 to spend , £ 4 @,@ 000 of which went on centre @-@ half Johnny Gill . Other signings included two of Taylor 's former players at Burton , defender Tony Parry and goalkeeper Les Green ; Parry would go on to win the club 's Player of the Year award . The pair went on to lead the club to an eighth @-@ place finish in the Fourth Division in 1966 – 67 after replacing most of the playing staff , an improvement on 1965 – 66 when the pair had only managed an 18th @-@ place finish . Clough had initially wanted to quit the club numerous times due to interference from chairman Ernest Ord , but Taylor insisted that they stay as they could not walk out on their first job in management . After Ord resigned as chairman Clough wanted to remain at Hartlepools , but Taylor persuaded him to take the offer to manage Derby . 
 = = = Derby County = = = 
 In May 1967 , Clough and Taylor left Hartlepools to join Derby County after being recommended to the club by Len Shackleton . At Derby , Taylor and Clough proceeded to re @-@ build the side , with Taylor instrumental in signing players such as Dave Mackay and Roy McFarland . Future England centre @-@ half McFarland , whom he described as an " uncut diamond " from the Third Division , was his first signing for a fee of £ 24 @,@ 000 . Other signings he initiated included winger John McGovern ( who the pair had signed at Hartlepools and would follow Clough on to Leeds and Nottingham ) and full @-@ back John Robson . After the 1967 – 68 season had finished with the club fifth from bottom in the Second Division , Clough and Taylor had released 16 players and numerous more staff members , including " a tea lady who laughed after a bad defeat " . 
 Derby were promoted to the First Division in 1968 – 69 , prompting chairman Sydney Bradley to state that " Brian and Peter built an ocean liner out of a shipwreck " . Derby finished fourth in 1969 – 70 , and then strengthened again from a player Taylor had scouted , signing midfielder Archie Gemmill from Preston North End for £ 64 @,@ 000 . Most signings involved scouting from Taylor , with the only two transfers he had played no part in being Clough 's former Sunderland teammates Colin Todd and John O 'Hare . Following a ninth @-@ place finish in 1970 – 71 , Derby went on to win the League Championship in 1971 – 72 – the first in the club 's history . Clough and Taylor continued to strengthen the club in the transfer market however , with Taylor noting that " a manager should always be looking for signs of disintegration in a winning side and then sell the players responsible before their deterioration is noticed by possible buyers " . 
 Derby reached the semi @-@ finals of the European Cup the following season , controversially losing to Juventus ; Taylor had spotted Juventus player Helmut Haller talking with referee Gerhard Schulenberg at half @-@ time and described how a " squad of heavies " restrained him after he attempted to overhear the pair 's conversation . Clough went on to call the Italian team " cheating bastards " . On 15 October 1973 , both he and Clough resigned , partially after a dispute with the Derby board over Taylor 's crucial but largely undefined role , although numerous reasons were behind Clough and Taylor 's resignation . Taylor in particular had been frustrated by what he felt was a lack of support from the club 's directors over the pair 's transfer policy . The pair had come close to leaving Derby earlier , turning down offers to manage Coventry City and the Greece national team . Fans protested against the board following their resignation , and the players also demanded they be reinstated , but chairman Sam Longson 's relationship with Clough and Taylor was irreparable . 
 " If we had stayed , Derby County would have won the European Cup long before Nottingham Forest and would still be among the premier clubs of England . They are back in the Second Division today because a few interfering directors imagined they could run the show . " 
 = = = Brighton & Hove Albion = = = 
 Clough was appointed as manager at Third Division Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 November 1973 , with Taylor joining as his assistant . Just after the pair were appointed , the team lost 4 – 0 at home to Walton & Hersham in an FA Cup replay and then 8 – 2 at home to Bristol Rovers on 1 December . Brighton finished 19th in the final table in the 1973 – 74 season , narrowly avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division , and the pair began to rebuild the team by signing Peter <unk> , Andy Rollings , Ian Mellor , Steve Govier , and Ken <unk> ; Taylor felt that Clough never settled at Brighton however , and spent too much time away on media commitments . Clough left for Leeds United in July 1974 , but Taylor refused to go with Clough as he felt Brighton and club chairman Mike Bamber had treated them well , and so the partnership ended after nine years as Taylor stayed at the Goldstone Ground as sole manager . He went on to sign striker Peter Ward and midfielder Brian Horton , but admitted that both he and Clough were much more effective as a duo ; he felt that he had struggled to make the good players he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that Clough had bought and sold poorly as Leeds manager . He stayed on at the South coast club for a further two seasons , guiding the team to a fourth @-@ place finish in 1975 – 76 , missing promotion by two points . His successor , Alan Mullery , managed to lead the team Taylor left behind to promotion in 1976 – 77 and then into the top @-@ flight in 1978 – 79 . 
 = = = Nottingham Forest = = = 
 On 16 July 1976 , Taylor resigned as Brighton manager and joined once again with Clough , who had by this time moved on to Nottingham Forest . After assessing the players Taylor told Clough that " that was a feat by you to finish eighth in the Second Division because some of them are only Third Division players " . He then berated John Robertson for allowing himself to become overweight and disillusioned , and got Robertson on a diet and training regime that would help him to become a top international . He also spotted Tony Woodcock playing for the reserves and converted him from an unwanted midfielder into a striker who would win 42 caps for England . In September 1976 , he bought striker Peter Withe for £ 43 @,@ 000 , and sold him on to Newcastle United for £ 250 @,@ 000 two years later . Withe was replaced in the starting eleven by Garry Birtles , who Taylor had scouted playing for non @-@ league Long Eaton United ; Birtles would also go on to represent England . 
 Within a year of Taylor 's arrival , Forest were promoted to the First Division after securing third automatic promotion place in 1976 – 77 . Taylor and Clough then decided to replace goalkeeper John Middleton with Peter Shilton , whom they purchased for £ 270 @,@ 000 ; Taylor reasoned : " Shilton wins you matches . " After spending some time secretly following Kenny Burns he came to the conclusion that Burns 's reputation as a hard drinker and gambler was exaggerated and he sanctioned a £ 145 @,@ 000 move for the player , who would become FWA Footballer of the Year in 1977 – 78 after being converted from centre @-@ forward to a sweeper role . Clough and Taylor were appointed joint @-@ managers of the England youth team in December 1977 , but the pair resigned after less than a year in charge as Forest 's success meant they struggled to make time to also coach the England players . 
 In their first season back in the top division , Forest won the Championship by a seven point margin ahead of runners @-@ up Liverpool , conceding just 24 goals in 42 games with Shilton in goal . They also won the League Cup , with a 1 – 0 win over Liverpool in the replay , despite Shilton , David Needham and Archie Gemmill all being non @-@ eligible to play as they were cup @-@ tied . In February 1979 , Taylor authorised the English game 's first £ 1 million transfer , when Forest purchased Trevor Francis from Birmingham City . Taylor later reported that Clough had been holding out for a fee of £ 925 @,@ 000 until Taylor rang Birmingham to confirm the deal at £ 1 million , before ringing Clough to say " We 've got Francis , I 've just paid their price " ; Clough replied simply by saying " Good " , and then put down the phone . 
 In 1979 , Forest won the European Cup with a 1 – 0 victory over Malmö FF at the Olympiastadion . They also won the League Cup again after beating Southampton 3 – 2 ; Taylor led the team out at Wembley as Clough felt it was Taylor turn – they always wanted to lead their team out together but were always denied permission by Football League chairman Alan Hardaker . After this success Forest bought Asa Hartford and Frank Gray , though Harford was sold on after two months after Taylor realised his limited passing range did not fit Forest 's style of play . Forest were denied a third consecutive League Cup win in 1980 after a defeat in the final by Wolverhampton Wanderers . 
 The European Cup was retained in 1980 , this time against Kevin Keegan 's Hamburger SV at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium . Clough and Taylor then began the process of breaking up the championship winning team , selling off Martin O 'Neill , Ian Bowyer , Garry Birtles , and Larry Lloyd ; as a new team was built based around youngsters such as Gary Mills , Stuart Gray , Colin Walsh , and Bryn Gunn . New signings included striker Ian Wallace and Switzerland international Raimondo Ponte . Taylor retired in May 1982 after Forest finished 12th in the league , with recent signings Justin Fashanu and Raimondo Ponte proving to be unsuccessful . Clough would stay at Forest for another 11 seasons , but without Taylor would only add two League Cups and two Full Members Cups to the club 's trophy cabinet , and would struggle against alcoholism . 
 = = = Return to Derby County = = = 
 Taylor took over as manager of Derby County in November 1982 , to the great surprise of most people in the game . He brought in Roy McFarland as his assistant , and signed Archie Gemmill and Bobby Davison . At the time Derby were going through serious financial problems and were bottom of the table , but he steered them to a mid @-@ table position by the end of the season with a 15 @-@ match unbeaten run . In the Third Round of the FA Cup on 8 January 1983 they knocked out Clough 's Forest team with a 2 – 0 win at the Baseball Ground . They reached the Fifth Round , where they were knocked out by Manchester United . 
 However , the following season saw the team struggle again , and Taylor resigned in early April 1984 with the club third from bottom of the Second Division , before Derby went on to be relegated . However , the team did manage to reach the quarter @-@ finals of the FA Cup , and the revenue obtained from the cup run helped to keep the club afloat . 
 = = Relationship with Clough = = 
 Clough was quoted as saying " I 'm not equipped to manage successfully without Peter Taylor . I am the shop window and he is the goods in the back . " The two worked as a pair by complementing each other 's strengths , as Clough had a forceful personality and was adept at motivating players , whilst Taylor was more reserved though had an ability to spot talented players . Former Hartlepools player Cliff Wright described the pair as " good cop , bad cop . <unk> would knock you to the ground , verbally at least , and Pete would pick you up and put you back together . " As the bigger personality and the man with the title of manager , Clough garnered much greater publicity than Taylor , which caused Taylor to grumble that " I sometimes wonder why he never says to Bell 's whisky , for instance , when they 're handing out Manager of the Month awards , ' You 'll have to present an extra gallon bottle . There are two of us . " On a personal level they were very close , and often finished each other 's sentences . 
 Though Taylor 's friendship and partnership with Clough had been strong , their relationship had sometimes become strained on occasion . While at Derby in 1971 , Taylor was riled when he learned that Clough had failed to disclose to him that he had received a pay rise of £ 5 @,@ 000 from chairman Sam Longson . He was also annoyed that Clough was often away earning extra money from media work while he was left to do a larger share of the work with the players . The relationship worsened in the autumn of 1980 when Taylor published With Clough , by Taylor , an autobiography which was largely based on Taylor 's work with Clough . Taylor had not told Clough that he was writing the book and did not give him a share of the proceeds . 
 Although they initially parted on good terms when Taylor retired in May 1982 , the relationship was finally damaged permanently after a dispute over the transfer of John Robertson from Forest to Derby , whom Taylor was now managing , in May 1983 . Clough was apparently angered that Taylor did not inform him about the deal . Clough attacked Taylor in a tabloid article on 3 July 1983 as being a " rattlesnake " , " a snake @-@ in @-@ the @-@ grass " and said that " We pass each other on the A52 going to work on most days of the week . But if his car broke down and I saw him thumbing a lift , I wouldn 't pick him up , I 'd run him over " . The two men would never speak to one another again . 
 = = Death = = 
 On 4 October 1990 , Peter Taylor died suddenly of pulmonary fibrosis whilst on holiday in Costa De Los Pinos , Majorca , at the age of 62 . When told of Taylor 's death by Ron Fenton , Clough apparently did not speak , put the phone down on him and cried heavily . He also , whilst very upset , made a phone call to the Taylor family . Clough attended the funeral 11 days later and dedicated his 1994 autobiography to Taylor saying " To Peter . Still miss you badly . You once said : ' When you get shot of me there won 't be as much laughter in your life ' . You were right " .

 = Death of Charlotte Shaw = 
 Charlotte Shaw was a fourteen @-@ year @-@ old British schoolgirl who drowned while crossing a swollen stream on Dartmoor during training for Ten Tors in 2007 . Her death , the first to occur in connection with Ten Tors or one of its training expeditions , made national news headlines in the United Kingdom . She was with a group of students from Edgehill College trekking the route of Ten Tors in training for the main event when the group got into difficulties crossing a stream . Shaw slipped into the water and was washed downstream . She was located 20 minutes later by a Royal Navy search and rescue helicopter and airlifted to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth , where she died in the early hours of the next morning . 
 A police investigation concluded that nobody should be held criminally responsible for Shaw 's death . The investigation was later criticised by the coroner , who adjourned the inquest and recommended that the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) reconsider the possibility of criminal charges . Three months later , however , the CPS reported that there was insufficient evidence to press charges and the inquest was resumed . After hearing testimony from eyewitnesses , including other members of Shaw 's group , the inquest concluded with a narrative verdict in October 2010 . In addition to the verdict , the coroner gave several recommendations for future activities of a similar nature . Among the recommendations were suggestions that both participants and the adult " team leaders " should receive better training . 
 On the same day Shaw died , 26 other participants had to be airlifted from the moor . The British Army , which organises Ten Tors , initially stated that the 2007 event would proceed as planned . However , in the light of severe weather and Shaw 's death , it was abandoned halfway through . The rules for the event were modified before the 2007 event to allow teams to carry a mobile telephone for use in case of an emergency . 
 = = Background = = 
 Ten Tors is an annual event organised by the British Army in which groups of young people , between the ages of 14 and 20 , trek a route of 35 , 45 or 55 miles ( depending on the age of the participant ) across Dartmoor . The event started in 1960 with just over 200 teenagers taking part and has grown to include 2 @,@ 400 teenagers from schools and youth organisations , mostly from the United Kingdom . The number of participants is capped at 2 @,@ 400 — 400 groups of six — to minimise damage to the environment caused by the event . Participants start from the British Army training camp at Okehampton and are required to carry all their supplies for the trek and spend one night in a tent on the moor . Shaw 's group , on a training expedition with dozens of other groups ahead of the main event , was accompanied by a teacher from Edgehill College designated the " team manager " . All team managers undergo compulsory training , run by the Army and the Dartmoor Rescue Group , which involves trekking the route themselves . 
 Charlotte Shaw was a 14 @-@ year @-@ old from <unk> , near Great Torrington , Devon . She was a student at Edgehill College , Bideford ( Kingsley School since 2009 ) , where she was involved in various sporting activities run by the school , including captaining its netball and gymnastics teams . Shortly after Shaw 's death was announced , the school released a statement in which it said " We are all shocked by the tragedy . [ Shaw ] was a delightful member of our school community " . Shaw was part of a group of 10 students from Edgehill who , along with 84 other groups , were training on 4 March 2007 for Ten Tors , which is held every May . Her death is believed to be the first to occur during , or training for , Ten Tors . 
 Dartmoor is notorious for its rapidly changeable weather . Weather conditions on 4 March 2007 were poor — described by a member of the Dartmoor Rescue Group as " atrocious " — and there had been heavy rain in the 12 hours prior to the accident , causing rivers and streams on Dartmoor to swell much higher than their normal levels . On the same day , 26 other teenagers had to be airlifted from the moor due to the adverse weather . 
 = = Death = = 
 During the training expedition , Shaw 's group came to Walla Brook at a crossing near <unk> Tor in the north @-@ east of Dartmoor . According to evidence given at Shaw 's inquest in 2009 , the group believed they had to cross because the alternative route would add at least four miles to the trek . Another member of the group got into difficulties crossing the stream , which , due to heavy rain , had swollen to approximately five times its normal size . The other group member removed her rucksack and passed it to Shaw . As Shaw , the last member of the group on her side of the stream , was throwing the rucksack across , she slipped and fell into the water . 
 Shaw was knocked unconscious and swept downstream . A third member of the group raised the alarm by mobile telephone by 14 : 05 ( GMT ) , less than five minutes after Shaw had been swept away , and Devon and Cornwall Police , a Royal Navy helicopter and the Dartmoor Rescue Group were mobilised to search for Shaw . Believing that the weather conditions may be too bad for the helicopter to fly , members of the Dartmoor Rescue Group — a volunteer organisation which co @-@ ordinates the four separate charities who undertake search and rescue operations on Dartmoor — set out on foot in an attempt to reach the scene of the accident . 
 Shaw was found by the Royal Navy helicopter , approximately 20 minutes after the alarm was raised , 150 metres downstream from where she had fallen in . Due to poor visibility as a result of heavy rain , the other members of her group had been unable to see her . The helicopter , from RNAS Culdrose , airlifted Shaw to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth , but she died in the early of hours of 5 March . The cause of death was later established as cardiac arrest as a result of drowning . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Devon and Cornwall Police launched an investigation into the accident , saying in a statement , " There is absolutely no suggestion at all of wrongdoing . The police are here to fully investigate the circumstances and report them to the coroner . " An inquest was opened and , three weeks later , the police investigation concluded that nobody should face criminal charges as a result of the accident . Shaw 's funeral was held in Bideford Methodist Church on 21 March 2007 and was attended by hundreds of mourners . 
 The Army said in a statement that it had no plans to cancel the 2007 Ten Tors event , however the event was abandoned halfway through due to " deteriorating weather conditions " . A spokesman for the Dartmoor Rescue Group said that Shaw 's death , which occurred in similar conditions , was a factor in the decision . For the first time , participants were allowed to carry one mobile telephone per group for use in an emergency . The Edgehill College team had been given special dispensation to enter a larger @-@ than @-@ normal team for the event in order to allow all the participants of the expedition on which Shaw died to take part . In light of Shaw 's death , the North Dartmoor Search and Rescue Team , one of four teams working under the umbrella organisation Dartmoor Rescue Group , developed a capability to conduct rescues from fast @-@ flowing water , known as " swift @-@ water " rescues . 
 = = Inquest = = 
 An inquest into Shaw 's death commenced in Exeter shortly after her death was reported to the coroner . The inquest heard evidence in late 2009 , among which was eyewitness testimony that the team manager , a teacher from Edgehill College , had met with the group the morning of Shaw 's death . During the meeting , the group asked to end the training hike early , but they were instructed by the teacher to carry on . However , the group 's navigator gave evidence that she and Shaw had been happy to continue the expedition . The possibility was also raised by other group members that the group was under @-@ prepared for the conditions they faced . The group member whose bag Shaw had been attempting to throw across the stream told the coroner " We were not told how to cross swollen rivers . We were told how to check how deep it was but we were never told how to cross them . Nobody ever talked to us about using ropes " . 
 The inquest was adjourned in December 2010 , as the coroner , Elizabeth Earland , recommended that the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) reconsider criminal charges in the case . The CPS completed its review in April 2010 and concluded that there was <unk> evidence to pursue a criminal case . Devon and Cornwall Police were criticised by the coroner for their handling of the investigation , particularly regarding contradictory testimony by eyewitnesses . The force voluntarily referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) after the coroner 's comments in December 2009 , but , in January 2010 , the IPCC decided not to open its own inquiry . A solicitor representing Shaw 's family said in a statement that " No @-@ one wanted criminal proceedings " , but indicated that the family planned to take civil proceedings against Edgehill College for negligence . 
 The inquest concluded in October 2010 . Earland , the Exeter and Greater Devon Coroner , recorded a narrative verdict and came up with several recommendations . Among the recommendations were that Ten Tors participants should undergo more than two training expeditions prior to the main event , that the team managers attain recognised qualifications and that the Health and Safety Executive ensure that independent schools adhere to the same safety standards as state schools . She went on to say that " It would be a tragedy if [ Ten Tors ] was to stop but the public need to be satisfied it is as safe as it reasonably can be , bearing in mind it is what it says , a challenge , not a survival exercise . " After the inquest , Shaw 's mother stated that she had been helped by the inquest , saying " I have found out the facts and I 'm grateful for that but I am still looking for accountability and some kind of apology and acknowledgement " . 
 Charlotte Shaw 's mother subsequently sued Edgehill College and the teacher leading the expedition for negligence . The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it . It further found that the intervention of a passerby , who suggested that the group could cross the brook , had meant that the school could not be held responsible for the accident . It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence . The judge therefore rejected the claim . 
 = The Return of Dr. Octagon = 
 The Return of Dr. Octagon is the tenth studio album by American rapper Keith Thornton , better known as Kool Keith . Released in the United States on June 27 , 2006 , it is his second studio album under the Dr. Octagon alias , following Dr. Octagonecologyst . The album revives the character of Dr. Octagon , who was killed off on Thornton 's 1999 release First Come , First Served . Production for the album began in 2002 under the title The Resurrection of Dr. Octagon with producer Fanatik J. 
 Thornton signed a contract with CMH Records to release the album . Following a contractual dispute , Fanatik J was released from the project . The album 's production was completed by the One @-@ Watt Sun production team based upon three completed vocal recordings and older unfinished recordings . Thornton had little involvement with the production of the album . He later stated that he liked the completed product , but that it hurt his musical reputation . 
 The Return of Dr. Octagon initially received great reviews . The first single Aliens garnered the coveted Guardian Single of the Week in the U.K. , and also was given a place among Wire Magazines top Hip Hop records of the year , but what followed were much more polarized reviews . The album did not chart . Much praise and criticism centered on the production , with HipHop <unk> stating " This is Kool Keith 's best album in <unk> even better than his classic Octagonecologyst , " and Newsweek stating that " If this album surpasses its predecessor , full credit goes to the Berlin production trio One Watt Sun , who come off sounding like a cross between Parliament @-@ Funkadelic and Kraftwerk . " Yet others felt that the production fit neither Thornton 's lyrical style nor the Dr. Octagon character . 
 = = Origins and recording = = 
 Keith Thornton , best known by the stage name Kool Keith , released the album Dr. Octagonecologyst in 1996 , under the name Dr. Octagon , produced by Dan " The Automator " Nakamura . Thornton later expressed some frustration with the " Dr. Octagon " nickname , saying , " Octagon wasn 't my life ... I 've done a lot of things that were totally around different things other than Octagon . Are some people just afraid to venture off into my life and see that I do other things which are great ? I think people stuck me with something . " In 1999 , Thornton released the album First Come , First Served , which featured a track in which the newly introduced character Dr. Dooom murdered Dr. Octagon . Thornton had intended to move away from the Dr. Octagon character , but later decided to record another album under the Octagon name . 
 In 2002 , Thornton announced The Resurrection of Dr. Octagon , a proposed sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst that would reintroduce the character . Los Angeles @-@ based producer Fanatik J was chosen to create the music for the album . Thornton himself took part in the production of early material for the project , playing bass , guitar , and keyboards on many of the tracks . 
 Thornton signed a contract with CMH Records to release the album . On July 23 , 2002 , Rolling Stone reported that a new Dr. Octagon album would be released in February 2003 . Explaining his choice of label , Thornton said , " I chose to go with somebody that [ would ] take this as a creative project , not a marketing project . Major labels tend to let inexperienced people oversee your projects . Your innovation goes down because they have [ too much ] input . You don 't see anybody going into the studio to tell James Brown what to do . Even though he can adapt to certain things , nobody tells him how to sing . That 's the way I feel about myself . " 
 Preceding the production of the album , Thornton told Rolling Stone that " this album is fine @-@ tuned with instruments , deeper and more spaced out . The last one was cool , but I didn 't like it because it wasn 't funky . When I don 't work on a project , it 's not that funky . When I do work on it , it 's funky , and it has soul to it ... I 'm proud of my funky sounds right now . " Fanatik J was not named as the album 's producer . Thornton stated that with Dr. Octagonecologyst , Thornton had given Nakamura his first successful album as a producer , and that with The Return of Dr. Octagon , he would " make another person and create another star . " 
 As production on the album was underway , Thornton had a falling out with Fanatik J over contract rights . Thornton referred to Fanatik J as " greedy " and stated that " He went out of his level of producer 's ranking . Maybe he thought he was an overnight Quincy Jones , that he was the Automator . " Fanatik J later engaged in a legal battle with CMH over contractual terms that did not give him input on remixes . 
 Following Fanatik J 's disputes with the label , CMH contacted San Francisco @-@ based producer John Lindland and Melbourne @-@ based producers Simon Walbrook and Ben Green to produce material for the album . Lindland , Walbrook and Green began creating material for the album under the billing of One @-@ Watt Sun . Thornton was briefly involved with the project , recording vocals for three tracks : " Trees , " " Ants , " and " Aliens , " based upon rough sonic and lyrical themes created by the production team . After Thornton had a falling out with the label over contractual terms , he gave the label recordings he had made two years previously , consisting of Thornton rapping and goofing off , in order to complete his contract . The album was completed without his involvement .

 One @-@ Watt Sun met at various points in Berlin , Prague , Melbourne , and Byron Bay to work on the album 's music tracks with Pro Tools software . The music and structure of the vocal recordings were completed the following year . None of Fanatik J 's production work appeared on the final album . According to Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown , One @-@ Watt Sun 's production incorporates elements of " pop , dirty blues , rock , and R & B " . 
 Some critics felt that the album 's production was inferior to that of Dr. Octagonecologyst . KutMasta Kurt , a frequent collaborator with Thornton , disliked the album 's production , stating " The Dr. Octagon character was rapping over sounds that were dark and sinister , but they turned the album into this dancey electro @-@ pop . A lot of it had this Euro @-@ dance feel , and I was like , ' Wait a second , not only did they change the music , they changed it into something [ to which ] I couldn 't relate . ' " KutMasta Kurt also recounts a conversation with Thornton on a European flight in December 2006 , in which Thornton stated that The Return of Dr. Octagon does not sound like a Dr. Octagon album . Thornton himself said that he liked the album 's production , but that the album hurt his reputation as a musician . According to Thornton , " I 'm not mad . But I don 't repeat words when I rap . They cooked up some electronic stuff , you know , WORD ! WORD ! WORD ! making me sound like triple people . It 's interesting . " 
 = = = Storyline and lyrical themes = = = 
 Although Thornton 's vocals were largely edited without his involvement , a background story for the album was created by the label and published in a series of eight segments , each revealing a new chapter and featuring an exclusive remix by the likes of Prefuse 73 , Aesop Rock , Kid Loco , Spank Rock and others . The remixers appear in the story as " interpreters " hired to decipher the meaning of each remixed song , reportedly sent in a package to the offices of OCD . 
 The story begins three weeks after OCD received the package . Still unable to decode its meaning , the record company receives a phone call from an unknown source , tracked to Los Angeles , New York , Australia and Saturn . The caller claims to have received the same package five years ago and that it had brought destruction and chaos upon his society , and warns that they are coming after Octagon . 
 OCD then receives a message from a hacker identifying himself as Cassettes Won 't Listen , who states that eight years ago , himself and five friends were abducted by aliens , tortured , cloned , and kept in isolation . The last survivor was killed by one of the clones , whom Cassettes Won 't Listen then went underground to fight . Cassettes Won 't Listen reveals that Dr. Octagon was imprisoned in the cell next to him , as " a prime candidate to study all things regarding grills , pills and bills " . Octagon was cloned : his clones have been sent out to destroy the universe . 
 Rob Sonic learns that the clones were created by a giant gorilla driving a pickup truck , who intends to steal the package to prevent the world from hearing Octagon 's message , allowing him to destroy the Earth . The story concludes with the remixers and OCD 's staff escaping with the package on Kid Loco 's plane . An intern briefly sees a figure standing on OCD 's rooftop , wearing a <unk> with a stethoscope around his neck , holding the head of " some black hairy creature " in his hand . 
 PopMatters writer Michael Frauenhofer wrote that " Dr. Octagon ’ s lyrics on this album typically appear to be unconnected , but over the course of each track can be seen building around a general theme , be it conservation , societal conformity , American militarism , or , yes , his characteristic fascination with sex . " 
 According to Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown , Dr. Octagon has matured and his focus has broadened since Dr. Octagonecologyst , in which the character focused largely on sex . Brown writes that Octagon is now " truly worried about the state of humankind , both physically and musically ; in short , someone who could truly save the world " . Brown also states that while the album focuses on science fiction and abstract themes , " there are also as many , if not more , songs about man 's own behavior toward himself and his environment . " 
 Frauenhofer referred to " Trees " as " a definite highlight " in which " the doctor drops his trademark off @-@ kilter raps on , surprisingly , environmentalism . " Pitchfork Media 's Tom Breihan wrote that the song " Ants " compares " the humans infesting Earth to ants in a colony , enthused and disgusted at once " . Frauenhofer , describing the song " Eat It , " wrote that Princess Superstar " constantly references sex " while Dr. Octagon " confusingly interjects with his complaints about how women only want to go out and talk and eat " , but Frauenhofer states that the sexual content of the album 's lyrics is not as explicit as previous Thornton albums , such as Sex Style . Dallas Observer writer Geoff Johnston described the song as being " as profane as one would hope for . "

 " Aliens " was released as the first single from the album . A remix of " Aliens " by British drum and bass producer Sub Focus was chosen as compilation of the month in the May 2006 issue of Mixmag .

The music video for " Trees " was produced as a public service announcement for MTV 's " Break the Addiction " campaign , as well as a promo video for the album .

 OCD International was created as an imprint of CMH to release the material . On October 12 , 2004 , a bootleg consisting of material produced by Chilly Chill from the <unk> Mob was released under the title Dr. Octagon Part 2 by Real Talk Records . It was discontinued by court order . 
 On June 27 , 2006 , OCD International released One @-@ Watt Sun 's material under the title The Return of Dr. Octagon in the United States on compact disc , although the completed work more closely resembled a remix album than what Thornton had originally intended . In the United Kingdom , the CMH @-@ completed album was released by <unk> Records on compact disc and vinyl . 
 CMH distributor World 's Fair promoted The Return of Dr. Octagon as the official sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst , and claimed that Thornton would tour in support of the album . Early news stories reported by outlets such as The Guardian , MTV2 , MySpace , Remix Magazine , and The Washington Post endorsed the label 's claims . Internet rumors began to spread that the album had been released without Thornton 's authorization via what turned out to be an unsubstantiated piece of journalism by David Downs . In August , Thornton performed under the Dr. Octagon billing , but did not promote the album . According to Thornton , " This ain 't the record I did . It was totally new music . I was really pissed off about people wanting me to go out and tour and do these songs . " OCD originally intended to ship 50 @,@ 000 units during the first year , but halted the plan due to the remarkably high volume of downloads received by the online remixes . 
 In September , Thornton stated that he had not received royalties from CMH Records . According to Thornton , " I hope they 're sending them . You have another interview if they don 't send me a check . Honestly , with the next single , I want them to leave me a sparkling diamond . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 Metacritic , which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics , gives the album a score of 61 % , denoting generally favorable reviews . The album did not chart . 
 The earliest reviews of the album , published by the LA Weekly and Newsweek , were positive . Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard wrote that " Octagon 's verses often feel unfocused and random , but when he bears down he can be mesmerizing , channeling his quick @-@ tongued rhymes with streetwise brassiness and cosmic vibrations . " Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown wrote that the album " doesn 't always make a lot of sense , but that 's the beauty of it . It 's a kind of concept album that concentrates more on the actual overall sound than the concepts . Its elements are all on the very edge of control , which is both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time ; if it works , it could bring us to where we 've never been , protect us from what may be , but if it fails , it could kill us all . " Hip Hop DX reviewer B. Love wrote , " This is Kool Keith 's best album in years — arguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst — and marks a fine return to form for one of rap music 's most distinctive and original talents . " 
 Other reviews were mixed . Pitchfork Media 's Tom Breihan wrote that " Keith himself is responsible for all of the album 's good moments . Even when he 's in unhinged @-@ rant mode , Keith 's imagery often remains lucid . And so the album 's best song is " Ants , " where he comes off frantic but omnipotent ... It 's dense and fascinating stuff , a tantalizing glimpse of what might 've happened if Keith hadn 't treated the reemergence of his most popular persona like an easy payday . " PopMatters writer Michael Frauenhofer wrote that " The Return of Dr. Octagon is still better than anything Kool Keith 's done in a little while , but apart from its best tracks , it 's not close to the level of his finest work of the past , and it doesn 't really build much on the legend of Dr. Octagon , which still rests most firmly on the good doctor 's debut . " 
 Negative reviews came from Billboard writer Ron Hart and Michael Pollock of Prefix magazine . Hart wrote that " Kool Keith has dropped nothing but disappointment and at an alarmingly steady rate . " Pollock wrote that " Despite all the stupid records he 's put out before , The Return of Dr. Octagon is the first one that plunges wholly into self @-@ parody . He 's now a fully realized clown , a prop , a joke and , most disappointingly , a sub @-@ par rapper whose forced ideas and personality obstacles have devolved into flimsy , uninspired character sketches . " 
 Dan the Automator criticized the release , stating " That wasn 't a Dr. Octagon record . Dr. Octagon is me , Kool Keith , and Q @-@ Bert . The label didn 't have the legal right to use the name , but I didn 't want to get involved in a legal battle ... Keith 's my man , just trying to make a little bit of money . " KutMasta Kurt stated that Thornton was reluctant to perform songs from the album , because the lyrics did not fit the music . John Lindland , who coproduced the final album under the name One @-@ Watt Sun , stated in defense of the album , " People say it 's a fake . We don 't have that feeling . We think that those are great tracks . It wasn 't about remixing anything . They were our ideas , and Keith went on grooves that we sent to LA . " In response to Fanatik J 's criticism of the album , One Watt Sun referred to him as being disgruntled as a result of the label discarding his music . According to Lindland , " If we were him , we 'd have [ a ] beef too " . 
 Dr. Dooom 2 , Thornton 's 2008 follow @-@ up to First Come , First Served , was produced in response to The Return of Dr. Octagon . According to Thornton , " I 'm one of those artists that people take my music without my consent . People love to snatch my music and do things on their own . You got people that put me on beats I never rapped on . I just feel that it 's a bad thing . "
