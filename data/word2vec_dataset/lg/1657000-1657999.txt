 " ' Anamnesis " is the nineteenth episode of the second season of the American crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium . It premiered on the Fox network on April 17 , 1998 . The episode was written by Kay Reindl and Erin Maher , and directed by John Peter Kousakis . " Anamnesis " featured guest appearances by Kristen Cloke and Gwynyth Walsh . 
 In this episode , Millennium Group member Lara Means ( Cloke ) teams up with Catherine Black ( Megan Gallagher ) , the wife of a fellow Group member , to investigate the possibility that a schoolgirl experiencing visions may be biologically descended from Jesus Christ . 
 Reindl and Maher based their script on their research into the role of women in the Bible , and compared the pairing of Lara Means and Catherine Black to that of the lead roles in The X @-@ Files , Millennium 's sister show . " Anamnesis " earned an audience of approximately 5 @.@ 2 million households in its initial broadcast , and received mixed responses from television critics . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Social worker Catherine Black ( Megan Gallagher ) arrives moments too late to prevent a shooting in a school prayer group . 
 Several days earlier , Black meets Emma Shetterly ( Gwynyth Walsh ) , the school 's vice @-@ principal . Shetterly explains that five students have claimed to be experiencing visions of Saint Mary ; she believes the girls involved are unlikely candidates for divine visions , particularly the trouble @-@ making Clare McKenna ( <unk> Templeton ) . Black speaks to the girls , who claim to have had visions during a sermon by Reverend Hanes ; Hanes ' son Alex refutes this . Black returns to Shetterly 's office , and is met by Lara Means ( Kristen Cloke ) , who works with her husband in the Millennium Group . Means explains that the Group has explored many such reported visions . 
 Later , Means and Black listen to McKenna reading a passage from the Bible . Afterwards , McKenna reveals that she knows a great deal about the Polaroid Man who kidnapped Black weeks earlier . Means receives a vision herself during the conversation , and becomes convinced that McKenna is a prophet of some sort . Black thinks the girl is acting out , but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non @-@ canonical Gnostic Gospels , which supposed that Mary Magdalene was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ . Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary , but of Mary Magdalene . 
 Later , Black is informed that the girls are missing . She and Means search the woods , finding the girls in a grotto . They are with a teacher from the school , Ben Fisher ( John Pyper @-@ Ferguson ) who attacks Means ; she subdues him and he is arrested . She later confronts him , and it is revealed he is a former Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers . When Black later learns that Fisher has been released , she fears for McKenna 's life . She rushes to the school , knowing the girls will be at a prayer meeting . She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting ; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna . Later , Means shows Black two sets of DNA test results — one from McKenna , the other from the Shroud of Turin . The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ ; Means entrusts them , and the decision as to whether to proliferate them , to Black .

 " Anamnesis " is the third episode of Millennium to have been written by Kay Reindl and Erin Maher ; the pair had penned two earlier instalments of the second season , and would return for another in the third season . The episode marks the only directorial contribution to the series by producer John Peter Kousakis . 
 Reindl and Maher researched early Christianity while writing the episode , learning that the traditional depiction of Mary Magdalene as a prostitute was probably an incorrect interpretation added later . Maher felt that Magdalene and early Christian priestesses were " pretty much weeded out of the Bible " over time , and wanted to explore the reasons why female religious figures may have been seen as threatening . The writers faced difficulty from the network 's standards and practices office , who had taken exception to the depiction of Jesus Christ as having had a family . The pair also compared the writing of the episode to Millennium 's sister show The X @-@ Files , believing that the dynamic between Means and Black echoed that of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully on the latter programme , with one character a believer in the supernatural and the other a sceptic . The episode 's opening scene makes use of the song " Dancing Barefoot " by Patti Smith .

 " Anamnesis " was first broadcast on the Fox network on April 17 , 1998 . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5 @.@ 3 during its original broadcast , meaning that 5 @.@ 3 percent of households in the United States viewed the episode . This represented approximately 5 @.@ 2 million households , and left the episode the eightieth most @-@ viewed broadcast that week . 
 The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a " B " , finding the character of Catherine Black to have been one of its downfalls . VanDerWerff also criticised the holy blood plot line , comparing it to other contemporary takes on the idea such as the computer game Gabriel Knight 3 : Blood of the Sacred , Blood of the Damned . However , VanDerWerff felt that Cloke and Gallagher worked well on screen together , but ultimately did not believe that Millennium had room for a character like Catherine Black . Bill Gibron , writing for DVD Talk , rated the episode 3 out of 5 , finding it to be " out of step , both with the series and the times " . Gibron also felt that the characters of Black and Means were not strong enough to hold an episode together as lead roles . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated " Anamnesis " one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . Shearman felt the episode suffered from having set up an interesting and emotive cold open , which he saw as a red herring to the episode 's mystical , theological focus . He was also critical of using Means and Black as the episode 's lead roles , finding that the lack of Henriksen 's character detracted from the episode . 
 = Wisbech Grammar School = 
 Wisbech Grammar School is a co @-@ educational independent school in Wisbech , Cambridgeshire for students aged 11 to 18 . Founded by the Wisbech Guild of the Holy Trinity in 1379 , it is one of the oldest schools in the country . The present headmaster is Chris Staley , a member of the Headmasters ' and Headmistresses ' Conference . Entry to the senior school at age 11 is based on a competitive examination . Pupils are also admitted at later stages , including sixth form . 
 Chartered by Edward VI in 1549 as a grammar school for boys , for much of its history it offered a largely classical curriculum of Greek , Latin and arithmetic under the governance of the Wisbech Corporation . The school has moved premises several times since its foundation , being based in St Peter 's Church , the old guildhall in Hill Street and on South Brink before merging with the Wisbech High School for Girls in 1970 at their present site on North Brink . 
 For much of the 20th century , it was a non @-@ fee paying voluntary @-@ aided school , but following local council plans to remove this status and merge the Grammar School with a nearby secondary modern school , the governors took the decision to become fully independent in 1983 . Now a fee @-@ paying day school , 650 pupils aged 4 to 18 attend from the three counties of Cambridgeshire , Norfolk and Lincolnshire . Following the closure of the nearby St Audrey 's Convent , a significant feeder for the senior school , a new junior and infant preparatory school was opened in 1997 , now known as Magdalene House . 
 Pupils generally take nine General Certificate of Secondary Education ( GCSE ) examinations in Year Eleven ( aged 15 – 16 ) , and they have a choice of three , four or five A @-@ levels in the sixth form . The majority of students go on to higher education following the completion of their A @-@ levels at the end of Year Thirteen ( aged 17 – 18 ) . The Wisbech Grammar School Foundation , which assists with bursaries , is a registered charity , number <unk> . Roughly a third of pupils receive support in this way . Former pupils are known as " Old Grammarians " , and the school has produced a number of famous alumni .

 Although the school has moved location on several occasions , each of its former buildings is still in existence . The school was founded by the Guild of the Holy Trinity in 1379 above the south porch of St Peter 's Church . The Guild was a powerful force in the later Middle Ages . The historical name " Schola Sanctae Trinitatis De <unk> " is still used on the school 's crest , which is derived from the seal of the Wisbech Corporation ( itself based on the former Guild seal ) and features the seated figures of St Peter and St Paul . The first record of a schoolmaster dates from 1407 when one Maurice Plank was given leave to study at Cambridge University for two terms on the understanding that he would appoint an usher to teach in his absence . 
 Soon after foundation , the school moved to the Guildhall in Hill Street . A record from 1446 details how master Jacob <unk> was granted leave by the Bishop of Ely to collect an " adequate salary " from each scholar according to the " praiseworthy , ancient and approved custom " . 
 Following the English reformation , the Guild of the Holy Trinity was dissolved and replaced by the Wisbech Corporation . The school was renamed and re @-@ established by King Edward VI in 1549 , who gave the school a charter " for the instruction of youth in grammatical knowledge and polite literature " . The charter is still in existence , and is currently held by the Wisbech Museum . The same year , land was given for the construction of a school house next to the Guildhall building . After the Restoration of Charles II , the school 's charter was renewed with the stipulation that the Capital Burgesses be given the choice of schoolmaster and that the Bishop of Ely " forever shall have the right of visitation , reformation , and correction of the schoolmaster , as of the school aforesaid " . 
 In 1638 a benefactor , William Holmes , gave £ 400 to the burgesses of Wisbech to be invested in land , and the rest applied for the maintenance of two scholars at Magdalene College , Cambridge . In his will of 1656 Holmes directed that the whole yearly income of his 46 @-@ acre estate in Holbeach , Lincolnshire be paid yearly towards the maintenance of the scholars and the endowment of the school . Other land and property had been donated to the school in the wills of Thomas Parkes in 1628 and John Crane in 1651 . Crane 's estate included land in Fleet , Lincolnshire and an inn on Market Hill called the Black Bull . 
 In 1792 , local businessman Joseph Medworth purchased the site of Wisbech Castle , including John Thurloe 's 1660 mansion and the land surrounding it from the See of Ely , building the Georgian Crescent along the bailey walls . As part of his scheme , in 1811 he tried to persuade the Corporation to purchase the mansion and demolish the Old Grammar School building in Ship Street with the intention of building a new street through to the market place . The Corporation refused ( it is usually assumed that the burgesses intended to purchase the mansion for the same purpose after Medworth 's death at a reduced price ) . As a result , in a " fit of pique " , Medworth demolished Thurloe 's mansion and erected the present Wisbech Castle building in 1816 . 
 An 1868 inspection by Henry Richmond of the Schools Inquiry Commission notes that the school was in a poor state of repair ; the school once had many boarders , but this was no longer possible because the largest dormitory needed extensive repairs . As a result , attendance had fallen from 60 to 22 scholars . Richmond records that the upper boys were reading Cicero , and their knowledge of Latin grammar was " satisfactory " . He also records the teaching of Greek , algebra , and English language , noting that French was taught as an extra . The inspector suggests that the reason for its decline may have been a nearby commercial school , and hints that the feeling in the town was that the largely Classical curriculum was " irrelevant " . He also implies that the state of the building may have been the result of differences between the headmaster and the Corporation . 
 The school continued to use the former guildhall site in Hill Street until 1898 , by which stage the medieval building was much altered and in a dilapidated condition . At this point , the school moved to an 18th @-@ century house on South Brink . A fundraising campaign was launched to pay for the house , but after insufficient funds were donated , the cost of purchase was met by Alexander , Baron Peckover . The house and its grounds was originally intended to be the headmaster 's residence and provide lodgings for a few boarders , but soon expanded to accommodate the entire school with the construction of classrooms and a hall . The central block of the 18th @-@ century town house was used as a panelled library . An unusual feature of the old town house is the cupola on the roof , evidence of the town 's sea @-@ based prosperity . 
 In his 1939 history of the school , headmaster H. Lawrence White opines that the purchase of this 18th @-@ century house was a " grave mistake " , as it was " constantly needing repairs " and was " difficult to warm " . He suggests that for the eventual price of conversion , a purpose @-@ built school would have been a more satisfactory decision . Initial plans to build a dormitory for boarding pupils were scrapped , with a physics laboratory being constructed instead , effectively ending the tradition of boarding scholars . The Education Act 1902 brought the school under the control of the Cambridgeshire local education authority as a voluntary aided school . By 1917 , the boys ' Grammar School had 64 pupils attending . Numbers had been swelled by an influx of boys from the Barton House School , a small private school which had closed in 1913 . 
 = = = Modern history = = = 
 The 1902 Education Act also made it a legal requirement for the County Council to provide an equal educational opportunity for girls . A conference was held in October 1903 to discuss the founding of a girls ' school , and by January 1905 Wisbech High School for Girls was established in Harecroft House on the North Brink . The house had been donated on a long @-@ term lease for the purpose by the Peckover family . Harecroft House had been built in 1844 by Algernon Peckover , and his descendants lived in the house until the death of Susannah Peckover in 1903 , after which it was left vacant . The first headmistress was Beatrice Sparks , who was the first woman to complete the Oxford Tripos in mathematics . New schoolrooms were added to the High School in 1906 , 1913 , 1922 and 1936 , when a mixed @-@ use gymnasium and hall was constructed . This hall is now used as the school dining room . Originally , the High School was also able to take boarders , which continued until after World War II . 
 The boys ' school continued to grow throughout the 20th century . 160 former pupils fought in World War I , of whom 11 were decorated and 9 " mentioned in dispatches " . 19 former pupils were killed in action . During World War II , 272 boys and 26 staff from the Stationers ' Company 's School in London were evacuated to Wisbech , where they were billeted with local families and shared premises with the Grammar School for teaching . 
 Both the Grammar School and High School co @-@ existed as voluntary aided schools until 1970 when they merged to become co @-@ educational , with the Grammar School moving into the North Brink High School site under headmaster Dr. D.S. Anderson . Relations between the schools had always been close ; the amalgamation had been planned for some time , and a number of new laboratories and classrooms had already been under construction on the North Brink site before the two schools merged . The school magazine <unk> was first published in 1971 . 
 In the late 1970s , Cambridgeshire County Council LEA and the local Member of Parliament , Clement Freud , were critical of the education system in Wisbech . At the time , entry to the co @-@ educational Grammar School was at age 13 , meaning that at age 11 , all pupils attended the comprehensive single sex Queen 's Girls ' and Queen 's Boys ' Schools until an eleven @-@ plus @-@ style examination was taken by all pupils . At this point , academically able pupils were moved to the selective mixed @-@ sex grammar school , with other children staying within the two secondary modern schools . 
 Plans to merge the grammar school with the two secondary modern establishments to form a comprehensive school were resisted by the Grammar School 's governors ; in a voluntary @-@ aided school , the local education authority was responsible for its finances , but the governors and headmaster had autonomy over all other school policy . As a result of the governors ' refusal , the LEA ceased to maintain the school , which became legally independent on 1 September 1983 . The separate Queen 's Schools , meanwhile , were merged to become a co @-@ educational comprehensive school , now named Thomas Clarkson Academy . 
 Soon after it became independent , the Grammar School lowered its entry age to 11 and joined the Assisted Places Scheme , a governmental scheme instigated in 1980 which allowed pupils who could not afford to go to fee @-@ paying independent schools a free or subsidised place if they were within the top 10 – 15 % of applicants in the school 's entrance examination . By 1994 , 53 % of the Grammar School 's pupils held assisted places , the highest proportion of all schools in the scheme . 
 In 1991 , a major extension to the school site added 19 classrooms , four laboratories , two computer rooms , a sports hall and library . The former gymnasium was rebuilt and extended to become the Russell Hall , the senior school assembly hall and theatrical stage . Following the abolition of the Assisted Places Scheme in 1997 , the school instituted a system of means tested bursaries known as governors ' assisted places . 
 A performing arts centre , the Dwight Centre , was completed in April 2003 with facilities for English and music teaching , drama and music technology . The most recent additions to the school are a new sixth form centre ( the Hazel Centre ) and the construction of a new astroturf pitch . 
 = = Admission and fees = = 
 The main senior school entry is at age 11 by a competitive examination . Pupils can also enter at second , third and fourth form levels . Offers of sixth form places are made on the basis of interview and a report . In 2008 , the senior school had 507 pupils , of whom 125 were in the sixth form , with roughly equal numbers of boys and girls . 
 Senior school fees are currently £ 3 @,@ 760 per term , with means tested bursaries available at Key Stages 3 , 4 and 5 known as governors ' assisted places . These are awarded following a review of parental household finances ; family income , assets and expenditure , and are reviewed on an annual basis by the school . 
 The school has a wide catchment area encompassing King 's Lynn , Peterborough , Whittlesey , March , Chatteris , Hunstanton and Long Sutton . School buses run from a number of these places , visiting villages en route , and there are late buses to most destinations for pupils involved in after @-@ school activities . 
 = = Curriculum = = 
 The school year is divided into three terms , with a five @-@ day week ( Monday to Friday ) . The school day is divided into eight periods of 40 minutes , with morning and lunch breaks . 
 Pupils generally take nine General Certificate of Secondary Education ( GCSE ) subjects in Year Eleven ( aged 15 – 16 ) , with compulsory maths , English , a language , humanity and science subject . Other subjects offered include art , music , resistant materials technology , food and nutrition , textiles , physics , chemistry , biology , French , German , Spanish , history and geography . Sixth form students have a choice of three , four or five A @-@ levels from a choice of 24 subjects . A 2009 Independent Schools Inspectorate report noted that GCSE and A @-@ level results were " well above the national average " . In 2010 , the number of pupils achieving the Level 2 threshold ( equivalent to five GCSEs at grades A * to C including English and maths GCSEs ) was listed as the second highest in the Cambridgeshire LEA with a 99 % pass rate . At AS and A2 levels , the school was listed as sixth in Cambridgeshire , with an average of 860 @.@ 9 points . The 2014 ISI report listed four ' Recommendations for further improvement ' http : / / <unk> / schools / <unk> / .

 After school and during lunch breaks , the school runs a large number of staff @-@ led activities , clubs and societies including archery , gardening , philosophy , electronics and photography . The Music Department also has rehearsals for the school orchestra , chamber choir , wind band and brass ensemble amongst other ensembles . Two thirds of the student body enter the Maths Challenge competition , and the mathematics department also runs a regular maths help club . 
 The school stages theatrical productions regularly , either in the Russell Hall or the Dwight Centre drama studio . Recent productions include She Stoops to Conquer , The Recruiting Officer , My Fair Lady , Amadeus The Duchess of Malfi , Pride and Prejudice , Oh , What a Lovely War ! and Twelfth Night . Drama and Theatre Studies is now an A @-@ Level option . The school publishes two periodicals : <unk> , a yearly school review magazine which is largely written by students , and The <unk> , a shorter newsletter which is issued at the school Speech Day in October . 
 Pupils participate in various stages of The Duke of Edinburgh 's Award , and the school runs expeditions to a variety of locations in the Lake District , Snowdonia and the Yorkshire Dales . The school has a long @-@ running exchange scheme with the Willibrord Gymnasium in Emmerich in North Germany , as well as a château trip for second formers and a study visit to France . Lower sixth formers can participate in the Young Enterprise scheme , and in 2010 the school companies were awarded 1st and 2nd " Best Company " in the Peterborough region and second in the regional finals . The school 's design department has reached the national finals of the <unk> competition to design and build an electric racing car for the last three years in a row with their car " Twin <unk> " . 
 Sport is also played at the school , and this rotates on a termly basis with rugby , hockey and cricket for boys , hockey , netball , cricket and rounders for girls . The sports teams compete against similar schools from Cambridgeshire , Lincolnshire and Norfolk . Athletics and indoor sports are usually played jointly .

 The present school houses are an amalgamation of houses from the boys ' Grammar and girls ' High schools ; in 1971 , the houses were named Parke @-@ Southwell , Peckover @-@ Crane , Clarkson @-@ Dennis and Holmes @-@ Sparks . Thomas Parke and John Crane were 17th @-@ century benefactors of the Grammar school , John Dennis was a Wisbech solicitor who was a governor of the Girls ' High School between 1904 – 1932 and Alfred Southwell was mayor of Wisbech in 1903 , who chaired the committee formed to set up the school and was subsequently the first chairman of the governors . The Southwell family , incidentally , once owned Bevis Hall , the manor in Wisbech St Mary which once held jurisdiction over the land on North Brink on which Harecroft House is sited . 
 = = Notable Old Grammarians = = 
 Former pupils are known as " Old Grammarians " . The school has a number of notable alumni . The earliest recorded alumnus is Thomas Herring ( 1693 – 1757 ) , who was Archbishop of Canterbury between 1747 and 1757 . Perhaps the most famous alumnus is the abolitionist , Thomas Clarkson ( 1760 – 1846 ) , whose father , John , was headmaster at the school . His essay on slavery and subsequent campaigning led to the foundation of the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade and the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807 , which ended British trade in slaves . Thomas Clarkson 's younger brother John Clarkson ( 1764 – 1828 ) also attended the school . He subscribed to his brother 's abolitionist cause , and became the first governor of the free Sierra Leone colony , founding the country 's capital city , Freetown . 
 Other figures from this era include General Sir Charles Wale ( 1765 – 1845 ) , the last British governor of Martinique , and The Hon. Charles Lindsay ( 1760 – 1846 ) , the last Bishop of Kildare . 
 Victorian composer and organist W. H. Jude ( 1851 – 1922 ) was a prolific lecturer and <unk> , and opened over 1000 organs across the UK and Australasia during his career . Another composer associated with the school was Peter Fenn ( 1931 – 2011 ) , director of music for Anglia Television , who attended the school as an evacuee during World War II . Philip Vassar Hunter ( 1883 – 1956 ) was awarded the CBE for his anti @-@ submarine research in World War I , and in World War II invented the buoyant cable which contributed to the defeat of the magnetic mine . He was later President of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and manager of the British Ice Hockey Association . 
 Sir Frank Stockdale ( 1883 – 1949 ) was a Holmes Scholar , and during his career as an agriculturalist played a leading part in establishing rubber , tea , and coconut research institutions . He was appointed the first comptroller for development and welfare in the West Indies in 1940 , and was co @-@ chairman of the Anglo Caribbean Commission . Brian Hitch ( 1934 – 2004 ) , diplomat , was also a Holmes Scholar and was High Commissioner to Malta between 1988 and 1991 . 
 The school has recently produced a number of actresses including Zara Dawson and Claire Goose . Other alumni include author John Gordon , known for his children 's novel The Giant Under The Snow ; economist Professor Stephen <unk> , who developed the price @-@ cap system of electricity regulation ; Denys Bullard ( 1912 – 1994 ) , MP for South West Norfolk , Fred <unk> ( 1923 – 2004 ) , Wimbledon tennis referee @-@ in @-@ chief from 1976 to 1982 ; Ray DaSilva , founder of the Norwich Puppet Theatre ; Richard Blakesley , joint inventor of the <unk> wand , which won £ 200 @,@ 000 backing on Dragons ' Den Mike Stevens , musical director and record producer , and Will Millard , writer , explorer and presenter of BBC2 's Hunters of the South Seas . 
 = = Magdalene House = = 
 A junior and infant department opened in September 1997 after the closure of St Audrey 's Convent school . St Audrey 's was a feeder school , and its closure allowed the then headmaster , Robert <unk> , to transfer most of the teaching staff to the new junior school . The junior and infant school has now become a preparatory school for the senior school . It was retitled as Magdalene House in 2005 , a reference to a 17th @-@ century scholarship which allowed two Wisbech Grammar School pupils to study at Magdalene College , Cambridge . There were 177 pupils registered in 2008 , of whom 23 were in reception and the rest in years 1 to 6 . 
 = SM UB @-@ 7 = 
 SM UB @-@ 7 was a German Type UB I submarine or U @-@ boat in the German Imperial Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. She disappeared in the Black Sea in September 1916 . 
 UB @-@ 7 was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November . UB @-@ 7 was a little over 28 metres ( 92 ft ) in length and displaced between 127 and 141 tonnes ( 125 and 139 long tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun . UB @-@ 7 was originally one of a pair of UB I boats sent to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy to replace an Austrian pair to be sent to the Dardanelles , and was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Pola in March 1915 for reassembly . She was launched in April and commissioned as SM UB @-@ 7 in the German Imperial Navy in May when the Austrians opted out of the agreement . 
 Although briefly a part of the Pola Flotilla at commissioning , UB @-@ 7 spent the majority of her career patrolling the Black Sea as part of the Constantinople Flotilla . The U @-@ boat sank one ship of 6 @,@ 011 GRT in September 1915 . In October , she helped repel a Russian bombardment of Bulgaria . She was considered for transfer to the Bulgarian Navy , but disappeared in late September 1916 before a transfer could take place . Her fate is officially unknown , but sources report that may have struck a mine or been sunk by a Russian airplane . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 After the German Army 's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I , the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders . Project 34 , a design effort begun in mid @-@ August 1914 , produced the Type UB I design : a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled . Constrained by railroad size limitations , the UB I design called for a boat about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displacing about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two torpedo tubes . UB @-@ 7 was part of the initial allotment of eight submarines — numbered UB @-@ 1 to UB @-@ 8 — ordered on 15 October from Germaniawerft of Kiel , just shy of two months after planning for the class began . 
 UB @-@ 7 was laid down by Germaniawerft in Kiel on 30 November . As built , UB @-@ 7 was 28 @.@ 10 metres ( 92 ft 2 in ) long , 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) abeam , and had a draft of 3 @.@ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) . She had a single 59 @-@ brake @-@ horsepower ( 44 kW ) Daimler 4 @-@ cylinder diesel engine for surface travel , and a single 119 @-@ shaft @-@ horsepower ( 89 kW ) Siemens @-@ Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel , both attached to a single propeller shaft . Her top speeds were 6 @.@ 47 knots ( 11 @.@ 98 km / h ; 7 @.@ 45 mph ) , surfaced , and 5 @.@ 51 knots ( 10 @.@ 20 km / h ; 6 @.@ 34 mph ) , submerged . At more moderate speeds , she could sail up to 1 @,@ 650 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 060 km ; 1 @,@ 900 mi ) on the surface before refueling , and up to 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ; 52 mi ) submerged before recharging her batteries . Like all boats of the class , UB @-@ 7 was rated to a diving depth of 50 metres ( 160 ft ) , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds . 
 UB @-@ 7 was armed with two 45 @-@ centimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes . She was also outfitted for a single 8 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun on deck . UB @-@ 7 's standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men . 
 While UB @-@ 7 's construction neared completion in early March 1915 , Enver Pasha and other Turkish leaders were pleading with their German and Austro @-@ Hungarian allies to send submarines to the Dardanelles to help attack the British and French fleet pounding Turkish positions . The Germans induced the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( German : Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine or K.u.K. Kriegsmarine ) to send two boats — its own Germaniawerft @-@ built boats U @-@ 3 and U @-@ 4 — with the promise of UB @-@ 7 and UB @-@ 8 as replacements . 
 When work on UB @-@ 7 and UB @-@ 8 was complete at the Germaniwerft yard , they were both readied for rail shipment . The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit . Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars . The boats were ready for shipment to the main Austrian naval base at Pola on 15 March , despite the fact that the Austrian pair was still not ready . German engineers and technicians that accompanied the German boats to Pola worked under the supervision of Kapitänleutnant Hans Adam , head of the newly created U @-@ boat special command ( German : Sonderkommando ) . Typically , the UB I assembly process took about two to three weeks , and , accordingly , UB @-@ 7 was launched at Pola sometime in April . 
 = = Career = = 
 During her trials , UB @-@ 7 developed a leak which took some time to repair . In the meantime , she was assigned the Austrian number of U @-@ 7 and an Austrian commander . Her German crew at Pola — since it was still the intent for UB @-@ 7 to be transferred to the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine — wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms . As time dragged on , the Austrian U @-@ 3 and U @-@ 4 were still not ready , and eventually Admiral Anton Haus , the head of the Austrian Navy , reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy . 
 With the change of heart from the Austrians , Germany resolved to retain UB @-@ 7 and send her to the aid of the Turks . So , upon completion of her leak repairs , the boat was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB @-@ 7 on 6 May under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Wilhelm Werner , a 26 @-@ year @-@ old native of <unk> . At commissioning , the boat temporarily joined the Pola Flotilla ( German : Deutsche U @-@ Halbflotille Pola ) . 
 Because of her limited range , UB @-@ 7 would not have been able to make the entire journey to Turkey , so on the night on 15 / 16 May , she was towed by the Austrian destroyer SMS Triglav through the Straits of Otranto and into the Ionian Sea . By June , UB @-@ 7 had reached Smyrna — not having any success on her journey there — and joined U @-@ 21 and UB @-@ 8 in the Constantinople Flotilla ( German : U @-@ boote der Mittelmeer division in Konstantinopel ) . Once there , UB @-@ 7 was ineffective because she was hampered by her limited torpedo supply and her weak engines , which made negotiating the strong Dardanelles currents nearly impossible . Because of this , UB @-@ 7 was sent to patrol in the Black Sea in July , cruising without success from the 5th to the 22nd . 
 In September 1915 , UB @-@ 7 and UB @-@ 8 were sent to Varna , Bulgaria , and from there , to patrol off the Russian Black Sea coast . On 18 September , UB @-@ 7 torpedoed and sank the British steamer Patagonia about 10 @.@ 5 nautical miles ( 19 @.@ 4 km ; 12 @.@ 1 mi ) from Odessa . The cargo ship , of 6 @,@ 011 gross register tons ( GRT ) , was the only ship credited to UB @-@ 7 , and the only one sunk by any of the Constantinople Flotilla in the month . 
 Because Bulgaria had joined the Central Powers , battleships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet , and aircraft from the seaplane carriers Almaz and Imperator Nikolai I began attacks on Varna and the Bulgarian coast on 25 October . UB @-@ 7 and UB @-@ 8 , both based out of Varna by this time , sortied to disrupt the bombardment . Off Varna on the 27th , UB @-@ 7 got in position to fire a torpedo at the Russian battleship Panteleimon ( most well @-@ known under her former name of Potemkin ) . Although UB @-@ 7 's crew heard what they thought was the torpedo explode , it did not hit Panteleimon . Despite the lack of success , the attempt did cause the Russians to break off their attacks and withdraw . 
 In early 1916 , UB @-@ 7 and UB @-@ 8 were still cruising in the Black Sea out of Varna . The Germans did not have good luck in the Black Sea , which was not a priority for them . The Bulgarians , who saw the value of the submarines in repelling Russian attacks , began negotiations to purchase UB @-@ 7 and UB @-@ 8 . Bulgarian sailors practiced in the pair of boats and technicians were sent to Kiel for training at the German submarine school there . The transfer of UB @-@ 8 to the Bulgarian Navy took place on 25 May 1916 , but for reasons unreported in sources , UB @-@ 7 remained under the German flag . 
 In July 1916 , the Germans sent SMS Breslau to mine off Novorossisk . To attempt to neutralize any Russian response , UB @-@ 7 — under the command of Hans <unk> , who had taken over for Werner when he returned to Germany to command the new U @-@ 55 — was stationed off Sevastopol to attack any ships that sailed in response to the mission . Unfortunately , Russian seaplanes spotted UB @-@ 7 and bombed the U @-@ boat , preventing her from accomplishing her goal . With the submarine out of the way , Rear Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak sortied with dreadnought Imperatritsa Mariya , cruiser <unk> , and five destroyers . The Russian fleet engaged Breslau , which was forced to abort her mission and retire . Sources are quiet on damage , if any , suffered by UB @-@ 7 .

 = = Fate = = 
 On 27 September 1916 , UB @-@ 7 departed Varna for operations off Sevastopol and was never heard from again . According to some sources , UB @-@ 7 was mined somewhere in the Black Sea . In June 1917 , a Russian pilot captured by the Germans reported that a Russian airplane bombed and sank UB @-@ 7 on 1 October at position 44 ° 30 ′ N 33 ° 15 ′ E , near the <unk> Lighthouse . Authors Dwight Messimer and Robert Grant are each dubious of this claim , and the fate of UB @-@ 7 is still officially unknown . Among the fifteen men lost on UB @-@ 7 were the Constantinople Flotilla 's senior radio officer , and the first Bulgarian submariner lost during the war , a trainee from Vidin . 
 = USS Kickapoo ( 1864 ) = 
 USS Kickapoo was a double @-@ turreted Milwaukee @-@ class river monitor , the lead ship of her class , built for the Union Navy during the American Civil War . The ship supported Union forces during the Mobile Campaign as they attacked Confederate fortifications defending the city of Mobile , Alabama in early 1865 . She was placed in reserve after the end of the war and sold in 1874 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Kickapoo was 229 feet ( 69 @.@ 8 m ) long overall and had a beam of 56 feet ( 17 @.@ 1 m ) . The ship had a depth of hold of 8 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) and a draft of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) . She had a tonnage of 970 tons burthen and displaced 1 @,@ 300 long tons ( 1 @,@ 300 t ) . Her crew numbered 138 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was powered by two 2 @-@ cylinder horizontal non @-@ condensing steam engines , each driving two propellers , using steam generated by seven tubular boilers . The engines were designed to reach a top speed of 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . Kickapoo carried 156 long tons ( 159 t ) of coal . 
 The ship 's main armament consisted of four smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 11 @-@ inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets . Her forward turret was designed by James Eads and her rear turret by John Ericsson . Each gun weighed approximately 16 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 300 kg ) and could fire a 136 @-@ pound ( 61 @.@ 7 kg ) shell up to a range of 3 @,@ 650 yards ( 3 @,@ 340 m ) at an elevation of + 15 ° . 
 The cylindrical turrets were protected by eight layers of wrought iron 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) plates . The sides of the hull consisted of three layers of one @-@ inch plates , backed by 15 inches ( 380 mm ) of pine . The deck was heavily cambered to allow headroom for the crew on such a shallow draft and it consisted of a single iron plate .75 inches ( 19 mm ) thick . The pilothouse , positioned behind and above the fore turret , was protected by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of armor . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 James Eads was awarded the contracts for all four of the Milwaukee @-@ class ships . He subcontracted Kickapoo to G. B. Allen & Co. of St. Louis , Missouri who laid down the ship in 1862 . She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be named after the Indian tribe , and was launched on 12 March 1864 . Kickapoo was brought to Mound City , Illinois , on the Ohio River , for fitting out and commissioned on 8 July 1864 with Lieutenant David C. Woods in command . 
 The ship was initially assigned to the Mississippi River Squadron and spent the summer off the mouth of the Red River . She was transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron on 1 October . Although the victory at the Battle of Mobile Bay on 5 August had closed the port of Mobile to blockade runners , the city itself had not been taken . The Confederates fortified the approaches to the city and heavily mined the shallow waters surrounding it . Lieutenant Commander <unk> P. Jones relieved Woods on 23 December . 
 On 28 March 1865 , Kickapoo was at anchor in the Blakely River when her sister ship Milwaukee struck a mine in an area already swept some 200 yards ( 180 m ) away . Milwaukee remained afloat forward long enough to allow her crew to escape without loss and they were rescued by Kickapoo . She rescued the crew of the river monitor Osage the following day after that ship also struck a mine and sank . In late June , the ship sailed to New Orleans to be placed in ordinary ; she was decommissioned on 29 July . Kickapoo was renamed to Cyclops on 15 June 1869 and then <unk> on 10 August . The ship was sold on 12 September 1874 .

 WWE 's Money in the Bank pay @-@ per @-@ view events feature their own variant of ladder matches , where multiple wrestlers use ladders to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring . Two briefcases were contested at the 2011 event , one each for members of the Raw and SmackDown brands . The respective winners were guaranteed a match for the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships at a time of their choosing within the next year . The 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , and 2014 Money in the Bank events featured a main event involving John Cena , albeit in different storylines . 
 By November 2010 , WWE had announced that the 2011 Money in the Bank event would take place on July 17 , 2011 , at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont , Illinois . Tickets went on sale in May 2011 through Ticketmaster with prices ranging from $ 25 to $ 300 . The event , sponsored by confectionery brand Skittles , was the second annual Money in the Bank pay @-@ per @-@ view ( PPV ) event and the seventh of thirteen in the 2011 WWE PPV schedule . The theme song , " Money in the Bank " , was composed by Jim Johnston . 
 = = = Storylines = = = 
 The professional wrestling matches at Money in the Bank featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre @-@ determined by the hosting promotion , WWE . Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE 's weekly television shows Raw and SmackDown with the Raw and SmackDown brands — storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs . These storylines provided the background to the 2011 event , which continued the storylines from the previous event in WWE 's 2011 pay @-@ per @-@ view schedule , Capitol Punishment . 
 The main event featured John Cena defending the WWE Championship against CM Punk . Punk pinned Cena in a non @-@ title match on the June 13 , 2011 episode of Raw , and then became the number one contender by winning a Triple Threat Falls Count Anywhere match against Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio on the June 20 episode of Raw . After the match , Punk said his WWE contract would expire at midnight on July 17 , immediately after the Money in the Bank PPV ended ; Punk vowed to win the championship and leave the company with it . On the next episode of Raw , Punk delivered a worked shoot promo and said that he , rather than Cena , was " the best in the world " ; he also berated WWE for not promoting him properly . Punk called Cena an " ass @-@ kisser " and insulted WWE management — including chairman Vince McMahon and executive John Laurinaitis . In addition to saying that he was breaking the fourth wall by talking to the camera , Punk proposed that he could defend the WWE Championship by wrestling in other companies such as Ring of Honor and New Japan Pro Wrestling after leaving the company with the title . As a result , Punk was given a storyline suspension and stripped of his championship match . Cena confronted McMahon and threatened to walk out on him and return the WWE Championship if Punk were not reinstated . McMahon relented on the condition that if Cena lost the title , he would be fired . On the following episode of Raw , McMahon tried to sign Punk to a new contract to ensure the WWE Championship would stay in WWE ; McMahon agreed to Punk 's demands and apologized to Punk before Cena interrupted the proceedings . The segment resulted in Cena punching Punk , so Punk tore up the agreed contract . 
 At Money in the Bank 2011 , Randy Orton defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Christian . The storyline started on the May 6 episode of SmackDown when Orton defeated Christian to become the champion less than a week after Christian had won the title . At Capitol Punishment on June 19 , Orton defeated Christian to retain the title despite illegally pinning Christian . On the June 24 episode of SmackDown , Christian demanded another attempt at the title from SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long ; his demand was granted with the proviso that he could defeat Kane . Christian lost the match against Kane by disqualification after interference from Mark Henry . Long then made a tag team match for later that same episode , pitting the team of Christian and Henry against Kane and Orton with a similar stipulation ; Henry pinned Orton in the bout . Afterward , Long offered Henry an attempt at the title if Henry could defeat Orton again . Henry lost the match after Christian engineered a distraction . This set up a match between Orton and Christian for the title at Money in the Bank . On the July 8 episode of SmackDown , Christian 's lawyers in the storyline added a stipulation to the match that if Orton was disqualified or there were poor officiating , he would lose the title to Christian . 
 The Raw Money in the Bank competitors were announced on the June 27 episode of Raw with no qualifying matches ; these were Alberto Del Rio , Alex Riley , Evan Bourne , Jack Swagger , Kofi Kingston , Rey Mysterio , R @-@ Truth , and The Miz . The SmackDown Money in the Bank competitors were announced on the July 1 SmackDown as Cody Rhodes , Daniel Bryan , Heath Slater , Justin Gabriel , Kane , Sheamus , Sin Cara , and Wade Barrett . 
 The feud between Big Show and Mark Henry started on the June 17 episode of SmackDown , when Big Show was forced to face Henry in a match . Big Show knocked out Henry before the bout began , creating a rivalry between the two . Henry interfered in Big Show 's match with Alberto Del Rio at Capitol Punishment and on the June 27 episode of Raw in a cage match . Henry versus Big Show was later announced for Money in the Bank . When Brie Bella lost her Divas Championship to Kelly Kelly on the June 20 Raw , a title rematch was announced for Money in the Bank . Kelly had been feuding with the Bella Twins since May 2011 .

 The event , featuring commentary by Michael Cole , Jerry Lawler and Booker T , began with the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match . During the bout , Sheamus slammed Sin Cara through a ladder propped between the ring apron and the announcers ' table with a powerbomb throw . The ladder was bent in half and Cara was stretchered away from ringside . Near the end of the match , Barrett , Rhodes and Bryan were the only three in the ring . Bryan put Rhodes in a guillotine choke submission hold on top of the ladder in the middle of the ring while Barrett sneaked up the other side of the ladder . After Bryan knocked Rhodes off the ladder , Barrett got Bryan onto his shoulders and tried to throw him off . Bryan countered with repeated elbow strikes to Barrett 's head . Bryan then kicked Barrett in the head and unhooked the briefcase to win the contest . 
 In the show 's second match , Kelly Kelly defeated Brie Bella to retain the Divas Championship . Kelly won the bout after slamming Brie 's face into the mat with her K2 maneuver . 
 In the show 's third match , Mark Henry defeated Big Show . Henry gained a two @-@ count after slamming Big Show back against the mat with his World 's Strongest Slam move . Henry then performed the move again and two running splashes for the pinfall victory . After the match , Henry jumped on a chair wrapped around Big Show 's ankle , causing an injury to Big Show . 
 The next match was the Raw Money in the Bank match , where all the wrestlers brought ladders . During the match , Evan Bourne performed his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver , diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside . Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder , and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury . The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring , but fell off one by one . With nobody left in the ring , Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg , but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb . As Mysterio and Del Rio battled on top of the ladders for the briefcase , Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder , which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat . Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match . 
 In the show 's fifth match , Randy Orton defended his World Heavyweight Championship against Christian , with the condition that Christian would win the title if Orton were disqualified or if there were poor officiating . Christian opened the bout by bringing a steel chair into the ring and trying to goad Orton into getting disqualified . Orton balked and threw the chair to the floor . Christian performed his signature Killswitch , forcing Orton 's face to the mat , but Orton kicked out of the pin at the two count . As Orton was prepared to perform his signature RKO move , Christian spat in his face . An enraged Orton kicked Christian in the groin and was disqualified , so Christian became the new champion . Afterwards , Orton twice slammed Christian 's face into the announcers ' table with his RKO maneuver .

 The final match was for the WWE Championship between Champion John Cena and CM Punk . WWE Chairman Vince McMahon had threatened to have Cena fired if Punk won . During the match , two separate signature Attitude Adjustment moves by Cena failed to score the victory . More than 30 minutes into the match , Punk performed his Go to Sleep maneuver , hitting Cena 's ribs and causing Cena to fall out of the ring . As Punk rolled Cena back into the ring , McMahon and John Laurinaitis emerged from backstage and distracted Punk , resulting in Cena placing Punk in the STF submission hold . Punk did not submit , but McMahon signaled the referee to award Cena the match and sent Laurinaitis to ring the bell . This was reminiscent of the Montreal Screwjob in 1997 , where a conspiracy orchestrated by McMahon led to Bret Hart losing his WWF Championship to Shawn Michaels by submission despite Hart never submitting . 
 Not wanting a tainted victory , Cena broke the hold and attacked Laurinaitis . As Cena returned to the ring , Punk hit him in the face with the Go to Sleep maneuver and pinned him to win the WWE Championship . McMahon ordered the winner of the Raw Money in the Bank match , Alberto Del Rio , to cash in his contract on Punk . When Del Rio ran out and tried to cash in his contract for an immediate WWE Championship match , Punk kicked him in the head before he could do so . After blowing a kiss to a distraught McMahon , Punk fled the arena and left as WWE Champion .

The main event won the Observer award for Match of the Year . 
 Alex Roberts of the Professional Wrestling Torch Newsletter attended the event . He criticized the ladder matches as " dangerous spectacles " where many wrestlers " took plenty of painful @-@ looking bumps " but often failed to score " a corresponding crowd reaction " . He also stated that the apparent injuries suffered by Sin Cara and the Miz in those matches had unnerved the audience . In contrast , Roberts felt that the two world title matches , which focused on " in @-@ ring psychology and storytelling " , were much more " memorable " or even " legendary " . Regarding the main event , Roberts said , " even a match @-@ ending run @-@ in bypassed the expected convoluted machinations and played perfectly to the narrative at hand " .

For the Orton – Christian match , Keller said that it was " paced well , executed well , and the finish played into the personalities and storyline of this feud " . Regarding the outcome of the Henry – Big Show match , Keller commented that it was " interesting to see WWE really truly get behind Henry for the first time after all of this time " . 
 Dave Hillhouse at the Canadian Online Explorer 's said Money in the Bank featured " exactly what a main event is supposed to be . A match that overshadows every other bout on the card , that has you , no matter how good each other contest is , looking forward to an ending just to be one step closer to the final contest . " Hillhouse rated the main event eight out of ten and the overall event six out of ten . When the Canadian Online Explorer polled its readers on the event , 26 % did not watch the event , 5 % thought it was disappointing , 6 % thought it was okay and 63 % thought it was great .

He said of the Orton – Christian match , " Christian ’ s character development was excellent " and that while the audience were initially " pro @-@ Christian , who was supposed to be playing the heel " ( a villainous character ) , they eventually cheered Orton 's post @-@ match beatdown of Christian . McNichol described the main event as " professional wrestling at [ its ] finest " and " probably the most gripping angle in wrestling this century " . He said the audience 's " astonishing " reception to the main event was as good as " any major match you have ever seen or cared about in history " , and the match itself " was methodical , played to both wrestlers ' strengths , and was beautifully paced " .

 After CM Punk left the Allstate Arena with the WWE Championship belt , celebrity website TMZ pictured him showing off his newly won title belt on the streets of Chicago with Colt Cabana and Ace Steel . 
 To crown a new WWE Champion , WWE Chairman Vince McMahon started an eight @-@ man tournament on the July 18 episode of Raw , which included all the participants of the Raw Money in the Bank ladder match except Evan Bourne , whose place was filled by Dolph Ziggler . The Miz and Rey Mysterio made it to the tournament finals , which McMahon postponed so he could fire John Cena as a result of the conditions imposed on the Money in the Bank match . Triple H interrupted and announced that the WWE Board of Directors had removed McMahon from power in a vote of no confidence , and that Triple H was to take over the day @-@ to @-@ day operations of WWE . Triple H refused to fire Cena . 
 On July 21 , Punk gatecrashed the joint WWE – Mattel panel at the San Diego Comic @-@ Con International with title belt in hand . He confronted Triple H and took exception to WWE attempting to crown a new WWE Champion . Two days later , Punk made a surprise appearance at a show hosted by the All American Wrestling company without his title belt to endorse Gregory Iron , a wrestler with cerebral palsy , as an inspiration for overcoming his impediment . 
 On the July 25 episode of Raw , Mysterio won the tournament to become the new WWE Champion , and immediately had to fend off Alberto Del Rio to prevent him from cashing in his Money in the Bank . Triple H , now Chief Operating Officer , decreed that Mysterio was to face ex @-@ champion Cena later that night for the title ; Cena won and again became WWE Champion . After the match , Punk made an unannounced return to WWE with the old WWE Championship belt to confront Cena . Cena and Punk later fought in a match at SummerSlam on August 14 to crown the undisputed WWE Champion , which Punk won . As Punk celebrated , Kevin Nash made his WWE return and assaulted him . Del Rio then cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and pinned Punk to become the new champion after kicking Punk in the head . Punk regained the WWE Championship from Del Rio at Survivor Series in November 2011 ; starting a 434 @-@ day reign until The Rock beat him at the 2013 Royal Rumble event . 
 After losing the World Heavyweight Championship to Christian , Randy Orton was granted a rematch at SummerSlam , where he won a No Holds Barred match to win the title . Meanwhile , in the storyline , Mark Henry went on to crush Kane and Vladimir Kozlov 's ankles with steel chairs . He defeated Orton at Night of Champions in September to become World Heavyweight Champion for the first time . Big Show returned from injury in October 2011 to feud with Henry over his title . Daniel Bryan initially declared that he would only cash in his Money in the Bank contract for a World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXVIII . However , on the November 25 episode of SmackDown , Bryan cashed in the briefcase after Henry had been knocked out by Big Show to become the World Heavyweight Champion . The match was voided by General Manager Theodore Long as Henry was not medically cleared to compete , and the briefcase was returned to Bryan . At WWE 's TLC : Tables , Ladders , and Chairs PPV in December 2011 , Henry lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Big Show . After the match , Henry assaulted Big Show which allowed Bryan to cash in his contract and pin Big Show to win the title . Bryan held on to his title long enough to have a World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXVIII in April 2012 , where he lost his championship to Sheamus . 
 Kelly Kelly 's next contender for the Divas Championship was Beth Phoenix ; Kelly defeated Phoenix to retain her title at SummerSlam , but Phoenix ultimately beat Kelly for the title at Hell in a Cell in October 2011 . 
 John Laurinaitis continued to appear on television after Money in the Bank . In October 2011 , he was appointed Raw General Manager , replacing Triple H as the on @-@ screen authority figure . During Laurinaitis ' rule , he feuded with CM Punk and later with John Cena , until he was fired in the storyline at No Way Out in June 2012 . 
 In later Money in the Bank events , John Cena , Randy Orton and Sheamus won Money in the Bank ladder matches in 2012 , 2013 and 2015 respectively . Cena cashed in on CM Punk and won via disqualification ; thus Punk retained the WWE Championship . Orton cashed in on Daniel Bryan and captured the WWE Championship . Sheamus cashed in on Roman Reigns and captured the WWE World Heavyweight Championship . 
 In WWE 's documentary CM Punk : Best in the World released in 2012 , it was documented from the out @-@ of @-@ universe perspective that a disenchanted Punk rejected signing a new contract with WWE for more than a year leading up to Money in the Bank . After being persuaded by Joey Mercury and Lars Frederiksen that he could only help wrestlers underappreciated by WWE ( like himself ) if he stayed , Punk signed a new contract with WWE about an hour before capturing the WWE Championship from Cena , while the pay @-@ per @-@ view event was ongoing .

 = Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment = 
 The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment , most commonly known as Rawlings ' Regiment in period documents , was organized in June 1776 as a specialized light infantry unit of riflemen in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War . The American rifle units complemented the predominant , musket @-@ equipped , line infantry forces of the war with their long @-@ range marksmanship capability and were typically deployed with the line infantry as forward skirmishers and flanking elements . Scouting , escort , and outpost duties were also routine . The rifle units ' battle formation was not nearly as structured as that of the line infantry units , which employed short @-@ range massed firing in ordered linear formations . The riflemen could therefore respond with more adaptability to changing battle conditions . 
 The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment consisted of nine companies — four from Maryland and five from Virginia . The two @-@ state composition of the new unit precluded it from being managed through a single state government , and it was therefore directly responsible to national authority as an Extra Continental regiment . 
 Because most of the newly formed regiment surrendered to British and German forces at the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16 , 1776 , the service history of the unit 's surviving element is complex . Although modern and contemporaneous accounts of the battle convey the impression that it marked the end of the regiment as a combat entity , a significant portion of the unit continued to serve actively in the Continental Army throughout most of the remainder of the war . Elements of the regiment served with George Washington 's Main Army and participated in the army 's major engagements of late 1776 through 1778 . Select members of the regiment were also attached to Col. Daniel Morgan 's elite Provisional Rifle Corps at its inception in mid @-@ 1777 . The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was reorganized in January 1779 and was stationed at Fort Pitt , headquarters of the Continental Army 's Western Department , in present @-@ day western Pennsylvania primarily to help in the defense of frontier settlements from raids by British @-@ allied Indian tribes . The unit was disbanded with all other Additional and Extra Continental regiments during the reorganization of the Continental Army in January 1781 . It was the longest serving Continental Army rifle unit of the war . 
 = = Organization = = 
 During the American Revolutionary War , the Continental Congress directed the organization of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment in resolves dated June 17 and 27 , 1776 . The unit comprised three of the four independent Continental rifle companies that had formed in Maryland and Virginia by decree of Congress in mid @-@ 1775 , and six new companies — two from Maryland and four from Virginia . The three 1775 companies , among the first of the colonial units to join the newly constituted Continental Army , were raised and initially commanded by Capts . Michael Cresap , Thomas Price , and Hugh Stephenson . The nine @-@ company force became a regiment on the same tables of organization as the 1st Continental Regiment , which was originally the Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment . Unlike this Pennsylvania unit , however , the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was an Extra Continental regiment because of its two @-@ state composition . It was not part of a state line organization but was instead directly accountable to national authority ( Congress and the Continental Army ) . The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment 's field officers were drawn from the original three 1775 companies based on their seniority . Hugh Stephenson from Virginia became the colonel , and Marylanders Moses Rawlings of Cresap 's company and Otho Holland Williams of Price 's company were designated the lieutenant colonel and major , respectively . All company officers were appointed in the summer of 1776 , and subsequent recruiting for the unit in the two states extended to the end of the year . Recruiting occurred in Frederick and Harford Counties , Maryland , and Berkeley , Frederick , Loudoun , Fauquier , Prince William , and Culpeper Counties , Virginia . The enlisted men of the regiment served for three years or the duration of the war . 
 = = Battle of Fort Washington and surviving elements = = 
 By early November 1776 , the majority of the regiment 's officers and enlisted men had joined Washington 's Main Army while it was engaged in the battle for New York City during the New York and New Jersey campaign . They were initially stationed at Fort Washington on Manhattan Island and nearby Fort Lee on the opposite side of the Hudson River . On November 16 , most of the regiment was captured or killed during the Battle of Fort Washington . The riflemen were defending the northern end of the American position from a much larger force of several thousand Hessian troops . After heavy fighting that lasted most of the day and during which the Hessians suffered many casualties , the riflemen were eventually driven from the outer works into the fort where they and the rest of the outnumbered American garrison surrendered to the combined British and German attack force . Lieutenant Colonel Rawlings was commanding the regiment during the battle because Colonel Stephenson had died of illness in August or September and had not been replaced . About 140 of the regiment 's officers and enlisted men — one @-@ third of the unit 's total complement of about 420 men — were not present at the battle , however , because they were still completing organization and recruiting . A few enlisted men of the regiment who escaped from their captors within the short chaotic period following the battle augmented this remaining active force , which continued to serve with the Main Army . On December 1 , the first day of the army 's next regular reporting period following the fall of Fort Washington , Washington provisionally grouped these remnants of the diminished regiment into two composite rifle companies commanded by the unit 's highest ranking officers still free — Capts . Alexander Lawson Smith and Gabriel Long . Smith 's company comprised all the remaining Marylanders in the regiment , whereas the Virginians of the unit were placed under Long 's command . 
 The regiment 's two composite companies served with the Main Army during its retreat across New Jersey in late 1776 , in the ensuing Battles of Trenton and Princeton in Brig. Gen. Hugh Mercer 's Brigade , and in the early 1777 skirmishing in northern New Jersey , a period termed the Forage War . While in winter quarters at Morristown during the winter and spring of 1777 , the two @-@ company force and other riflemen from Pennsylvania and Virginia Line regiments supported detached elements of line infantry units in front @-@ line positions and conducted patrols in northern New Jersey , primarily to keep the enemy 's aggressive foraging activities in check . Because the two units under Captains Smith and Long provided an experienced , if small , force , Washington also used them to bolster the new 11th Virginia Regiment commanded by Col. Daniel Morgan after its arrival at Morristown in early April by formally attaching them to this Virginia regiment . Washington 's decision to join the two composite companies with the 11th Virginia Regiment was based on Morgan 's earlier direct association with the original three independent Continental rifle companies of 1775 that formed the core element of Rawlings ' regiment . Inasmuch as the attachment of one military unit to another was technically a temporary arrangement , however , the permanent unit of Smith 's and Long 's composite companies remained the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment . The first muster rolls of the two companies taken after the Battle of Fort Washington , both dated May 16 , 1777 , were compiled by the army staff as a result of the attachment process and show that the units comprised about 110 officers and enlisted men on active duty in the spring of 1777 . The rolls also document that the units had lost a number of men over the winter months following the battle , primarily through desertion and a few deaths due to illness or wounds . 
 = = Attachment to Morgan 's Provisional Rifle Corps = = 
 The success of these rifle units during the skirmishing period , coupled with the arrival of large numbers of new army recruits , led Washington to create additional provisional rifle companies . He placed them under the command of Daniel Morgan in early June 1777 , calling the unit the Provisional Rifle Corps , although it was most commonly known as Morgan 's Rifle Corps in period documents . Morgan then simultaneously led the 11th Virginia Regiment , his permanent unit , and this provisional unit . Thirty @-@ five officers and enlisted men in Smith 's and Long 's composite companies , as well as others selected from their regular musket regiments , were detached from their permanent units to form this elite regiment @-@ sized force . The men from the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment all served in one of the Rifle Corps ' eight companies , Capt. Gabriel Long 's Provisional Rifle Company ; with the exception of a single man , all other members of the company came from the 11th Virginia Regiment . Like Morgan , Long was now technically in command of two Continental Army units , one permanent and one provisional . Long served in the Rifle Corps until his resignation in May 1779 , at which time command of his company passed to Marylander Lt. Elijah Evans , also one of the original officers of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment . Evans returned to Rawlings ' regiment , his permanent unit , when his detached duty in the Rifle Corps ended with its formal disbanding in early November 1779 . The Rifle Corps is most notable for the major role it played in the Battles of Saratoga . 
 Most members of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment , however , were not chosen for the Rifle Corps and remained with the Main Army . The Marylanders in Smith 's composite company served with the 11th Virginia Regiment in the 3rd Virginia Brigade at the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown , as well as at the Battle of Monmouth after they were administratively attached to the 4th Maryland Regiment of the 2nd Maryland Brigade at the end of the 1777 campaign season . The Virginians in Long 's composite company remained attached to the 11th Virginia Regiment and fought at the same engagements in 1777 and 1778 . Lt. ( later Capt. ) Philip Slaughter was the acting commander of the company during Long 's nearly two @-@ year attachment to the Rifle Corps and its permanent commander after Long 's resignation . 
 = = Fort Frederick and reorganization = = 
 Soon after Lt. Col. Moses Rawlings , a Marylander , was exchanged from British captivity in late December 1777 or January 1778 , the Board of War , at the request of the Maryland state government , assigned him command of the prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp at Fort Frederick , Maryland , and its state militia guard . The elements of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment in the field continued to be led by the company commanders until recruiting could bring the regiment up to greater strength . Maj. Otho Holland Williams , exchanged on January 16 , 1778 ( likely with Rawlings ) , had been promoted to colonel of the 6th Maryland Regiment in December 1776 while a prisoner of war ; he took command of this unit upon his release . The position of major in the reduced Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was never refilled . 
 In the late spring of 1778 , Rawlings began marshaling his regiment , including returning prisoners of war and new recruits , to reestablish its full complement . His efforts met with only limited success , however , despite Washington 's request to Maryland governor Thomas Johnson in late December 1777 in anticipation of Rawlings ' imminent exchange " that the most early and vigorous measures will be adopted , not only to make [ Rawlings ' ] Regiment more respectable , but compleat [ sic ] . " Moreover , in early October 1778 Congress permitted Rawlings and his officers to recruit outside Maryland , with each new <unk> being officially entitled to the enlistment bonus and clothing allowance of his own state 's line organization . Implementation of this unusual ruling , however , added few men to the unit , reflecting the Continental Army 's increasing difficulty in recruiting by this time of the war . The few recruiting records for the unit that exist indicate that by the end of 1778 , Rawlings ' force of Continental regulars at Fort Frederick probably included no more than 30 to 40 new enlistees . 
 Washington initiated more definitive measures to strengthen the regiment in early 1779 . At his request , Congress authorized on January 23 the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment to be reorganized into three companies , recruited to full strength , and reassigned from Fort Frederick to Fort Pitt , headquarters of the Continental Army 's Western Department . The reorganization , which was implemented on March 21 , served to supplement forces engaged in the defense of frontier settlements of present @-@ day western Pennsylvania and vicinity from Indian raids that had started in early 1777 . In mid @-@ 1778 , after more than a year of these attacks , largely by warriors of British @-@ allied Iroquois tribes and Loyalist forces , Washington commenced a concerted effort to neutralize the threat to the backcountry settlements of New York , Pennsylvania , and Virginia — the war 's western front . In support of the reorganization process , on February 16 , 1779 , Washington ordered that all the regiment 's detached members in the Main Army be reincorporated into the unit . Pursuant to Washington 's order , the enlisted men in Smith 's composite company who were attached to the 4th Maryland Regiment rejoined Rawlings ' command . In contrast , the Virginians of Long 's composite company already had been all but formally incorporated into the 11th Virginia Regiment by order of the Virginia state government in February 1777 . ( Because Long 's unit was a component of an Extra Continental regiment and therefore had no administrative connection to an individual state , the Virginia state government had exceeded its authority in this action , which was technically only within the purview of Congress . Washington tacitly accepted the arrangement , but the process was probably not formalized until the reorganization and redesignation of the 11th Virginia Regiment as the 7th Virginia Regiment on May 12 , 1779 . ) Moreover , the enlisted men of Smith 's and Long 's companies who were still attached to the Provisional Rifle Corps , which was not part of the Main Army at this time , remained in that unit until mid @-@ 1779 , at which time they left the service because their three @-@ year enlistment periods had expired . Rawlings ' force therefore now consisted of almost all Marylanders and was variously identified as the " Maryland Corps , " " Maryland Rifle Corps , " and " Maryland Independent Corps " during its service on the western frontier . The unit , however , remained outside the state line organization , a source of great frustration for its officers . Because no unit @-@ redesignation orders accompanied the reorganization orders , the unit 's formal name remained the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment despite significant variations from the unit 's original 1776 configuration . 
 = = Fort Pitt and the Western Department = = 
 After recruitment of the three companies had been no more than partially completed , Rawlings ' regiment set off for Fort Pitt , arriving there in late May 1779 . The three companies consisted of about 100 enlisted men , well below the prescribed total of about 60 enlisted men per company in a Continental Army line infantry regiment in 1779 . Moreover , a month after its arrival , the unit lost almost half of its troop strength because the three @-@ year enlistment periods of those men who had joined the regiment during its organization in mid @-@ 1776 had terminated . To further complicate matters , Rawlings resigned his command of the regiment on June 2 , primarily because of his frustration over not being able to fully rebuild the unit , and did not accompany his men . He remained the commandant of Fort Frederick and subsequently served as Deputy Commissary of Prisoners for Maryland . Capt. Alexander Lawson Smith also did not proceed to Fort Pitt with the riflemen . He likely stayed with the 4th Maryland Regiment of the Main Army in a continued attached capacity until Congress approved his resignation from " the regiment formerly Rawlins [ sic ] " in September 1780 . The regiment was now commanded by senior captain Thomas Beall and later Capt. Adamson Tannehill , both of whom had been with the unit since its inception . 
 The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment complemented the existing garrison at Fort Pitt : the 8th Pennsylvania and 9th ( formerly 13th ) Virginia Regiments . The men of these Pennsylvania and Virginia line infantry units had been recruited from the central and western frontier counties of the two states and were assigned to the army 's Western Department while at Valley Forge , reflecting a clear logic on Washington 's part . With the arrival of Rawlings ' regiment , Western Department commander Col. Daniel Brodhead now led a force of largely frontier raised men experienced in Indian @-@ style woodlands warfare . In his most notable tactical achievement , Brodhead headed a campaign of about 600 of his Continental regulars , which included the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment , local militia , and volunteers to the upper waters of the Allegheny River in August and September 1779 , where they destroyed the villages and crops of hostile Mingo and Munsee Indians . Brodhead 's expedition was part of Washington 's wide @-@ ranging , coordinated offensive of the summer of 1779 that also included the larger , concurrent Sullivan Campaign led by Maj. Gen. John Sullivan and Brig. Gen. James Clinton against enemy Iroquois and Loyalist units in southern and western New York State . From mid @-@ 1779 until late 1780 , however , the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was primarily deployed in detachments to support line infantry contingents at several of the frontier outposts in the general vicinity of Fort Pitt , including Fort Laurens , Fort McIntosh , and Fort Henry ( Wheeling ) in what is now eastern Ohio , western Pennsylvania , and northernmost West Virginia , respectively . 
 Change in command of the regiment occurred for the third time in late 1780 . Under continual pressure to maintain sufficient troop strength in the unit , regimental commander Capt. Thomas Beall ran afoul of army regulations and Western Department commander Brodhead by approving the enlistment of a British prisoner of war in February 1780 . Beall tried to rectify his lapse in judgment by discharging the recruit , although after he had already been given his recruitment bounty and service clothes . On August 14 , 1780 , at Fort Pitt , Captain Beall was tried by court @-@ martial , found guilty of " discharging a Soldier after having been duly <unk> [ sic ] and receiving his regimental <unk> [ sic ] through private and interested views thereby defrauding the United States , " and on October 13 , was dismissed from the service . Capt. Adamson Tannehill succeeded Beall as commander of the regiment for the remaining few months of the unit 's existence . 
 = = Disbanding = = 
 On November 1 , 1780 , Washington issued orders approved by Congress that specified plans for the comprehensive reorganization of the Continental Army effective January 1 , 1781 . All Additional and Extra Continental regiments , such as the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment , that had not been annexed to a state line organization were disbanded by that date . The much @-@ diminished unit comprised only 2 officers and 50 enlisted men in late December 1780 . The officers received discharges on January 1 , 1781 , and the enlisted men of the unit were transferred to the Maryland Line . Relocation of the men from their remote post at Fort Pitt to their new assignments , however , was not completed until November 1781 , at least in part because their officers were not present to supervise the process . 
 The lineage of the regiment 's Virginia elements is carried on by the 201st Field Artillery Regiment ( United States ) .

 The Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club is an Australian professional rugby league football club based in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney . The club competes in the National Rugby League ( NRL ) competition and is one of the oldest and most successful clubs in Australian rugby league history , having won thirteen New South Wales Rugby League ( NSWRL ) and National Rugby League titles , and several other competitions . Only the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the St. George Dragons have won more premierships . The club holds the record for having the most wins and the second greatest margin of victory in a match in Australian rugby league history . The Eastern Suburbs <unk> is the only club to have played in each and every season at the elite level , and since the 1970s has often been dubbed the " glamour club " of the league . Coached by Trent Robinson along with captain Jake Friend , the Roosters play their home games at the Sydney Football Stadium . 
 The club was founded in 1908 in Paddington , Sydney , under the name Eastern Suburbs ; in 1995 the club 's marketing brand name was changed to the Sydney City Roosters and , in 2000 , to simply the Sydney Roosters . The Bondi Junction and Moore Park @-@ based Roosters have a long @-@ standing and fierce rivalry with other Sydney @-@ based clubs , especially the South Sydney Rabbitohs , a fellow foundation club based in neighbouring Redfern . Notwithstanding its branding as the Sydney Roosters , the official name of the club , holder of the NRL licence , remains the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club , the same name it has had since 1908 . As such , much of the club 's merchandise and paraphernalia , especially those marketed directly to long @-@ serving and dedicated members , includes the insignia ESDRLFC . 
 = = History = = 
 The Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club ( ESDRLFC ) was formed on 24 January 1908 at a meeting at the Paddington Town Hall in Sydney after it was decided that the district should enter a team in the newly formed New South Wales Rugby Football League . The ESDRLFC was formed , under its articles of association with the NSWRL , to represent the geographic areas in Sydney covering the Waverley , Randwick , Woollahra , Paddington , Darlinghurst and Vaucluse local government municipalities , as well as the eastern parts of the Sydney CBD . Indeed , the ' suburb ' of Sydney , postcode 2000 , falls entirely within the official boundaries of the ESDRLFC . 
 Unofficially nicknamed the " <unk> " due to their red , white and blue playing strip , Eastern Suburbs won its first match , defeating Newtown 32 – 16 at Wentworth Oval on 20 April 1908 . In 1913 , they became the first club to win three consecutive premierships ; the line @-@ ups during this period included the likes of Dally Messenger , Harry " Jersey " Flegg and Sandy Pearce , all regarded as all @-@ time rugby league greats . However , the club rapidly declined and failed to win the premiership for the next nine seasons . 
 Eastern Suburbs missed the finals once from 1926 to 1942 , and in that time won four titles and the minor premiership on seven occasions . During this period , Dave Brown set several point @-@ scoring records that still stand . In 1935 , the team lost just one game , and recorded the highest winning margin in their history , an 87 – 7 ( 106 – 8 in modern scoring ) victory over Canterbury . In 1936 , Eastern Suburbs became one of five teams in premiership history to remain undefeated for an entire season , a feat they repeated the following year . They are the only club to remain unbeaten for two consecutive seasons . 
 Despite claiming the premiership in 1945 , Eastern Suburbs failed to make the finals for the following seven seasons . A runners @-@ up finish in 1960 was the closest the club came to claiming the premiership during this era . Eastern Suburbs were soundly defeated 31 – 6 in the grand final that year , by the famous record @-@ beating St George outfit . In 1966 , the club fell to new depths and was winless for the first time in its history . It was also the last occasion in which the Roosters won the wooden spoon until claiming it again in the 2009 season . It ended a poor run for Eastern Suburbs ; from 1963 to 1966 , they won 8 of 72 matches , finishing second to last in 1964 and last in the other three years . The club underwent a renaissance in 1967 after appointing Jack Gibson as coach ( 1967 – 68 ) , and introducing a new emblem on the playing jerseys , the rooster . 
 From 1972 to 1982 , the Roosters won four minor premierships and played in four grand finals , winning two consecutively . Gibson , now dubbed as " Super Coach " , returned to lead the team from 1974 to 1976 . In 1974 and 1975 , the team won 39 of 44 matches , both minor premierships , and both grand finals and set a premiership record of 19 consecutive wins . The 38 – 0 grand final victory in 1975 against St George was the largest margin in a first grade grand final , and the record stood for 33 years until superseded by Manly 's 40 – nil win over the Melbourne Storm in 2008 . With line @-@ ups including Mark Harris , Elwyn Walters , John Brass , Bill Mullins , Russell Fairfax , Johnny Mayes , John Peard , Ron Coote , Ian Schubert and captain Arthur <unk> , the Centenary of Rugby League panel considered the Roosters of 1974 and 1975 to be among the greatest club teams of all time . 
 Between 1984 and 1995 , the Roosters reached the semi @-@ finals once , and became known to critics as the " transit lounge " , due to the high frequency of player purchases and releases . The club came close to reaching the premiership in 1987 under coach and favourite son Arthur <unk> , being defeated by eventual premiers Manly in a " bruising " major semi @-@ final , 10 – 6 . 
 As the Super League war built up in the mid @-@ 1990s , the Roosters recruited high profile coach Phil Gould and star five @-@ eighth Brad Fittler , both from the Penrith Panthers . This helped to quickly send the Roosters back to the upper end of the ladder . Fittler 's presence proved invaluable ; during his reign , the Roosters competed in four grand finals in five years . In 2002 , the club captured its 12th premiership — the first in 27 years — defeating minor premiers the New Zealand Warriors 30 – 8 in the 2002 NRL grand final . 
 In the 2003 NRL grand final against the Penrith Panthers , the Roosters lost 18 – 6 in what was their heaviest defeat for the year . A decisive moment occurred midway through the second half : with the scores tied at 6 @-@ all , Roosters winger Todd Byrne made a clear break down the sideline and looked set to score a try before being chased down and tackled into touch by Penrith lock forward , Scott Sattler . From then on , the momentum of the game was with Penrith . The Roosters ' made the Grand Final in 2004 , when they ceded a 13 – 6 half @-@ time lead to be defeated by the Bulldogs 16 – 13 . The match was captain Fittler 's last for the team . 
 In 2007 , the Roosters became the first club to play 100 seasons of first grade rugby league ; they were the only outfit to play in each season since the competition 's inception in 1908 . They appointed Chris Anderson as coach for 2007 and 2008 following two relatively unsuccessful years under Ricky Stuart . On 9 July 2007 , Anderson resigned after a 56 – 0 loss to the Manly @-@ Warringah Sea Eagles . Assistant Coach Fittler acted as the caretaker for the remainder of the 2007 season , before being appointed in August to the top job for two years . With eight rounds remaining in a disappointing 2009 season in which the Roosters finished with the wooden spoon for the first time in 43 years , Fittler was informed he would not be the coach in 2010 , his position to be taken by veteran coach Brian Smith . The Roosters wound up winning only five games for the entire season ; twice against Cronulla and once against each of Canberra in Canberra , eventual grand finalists Parramatta and Newcastle in Newcastle . 
 A year after finishing last , under the coaching of Brian Smith they reached the 2010 NRL Grand Final where the St. George Illawarra Dragons defeated them 32 – 8 . The Roosters led 8 – 6 at half time but were overrun in the second half . 
 What followed was another relatively disappointing season at Bondi Junction , with the Roosters finishing 11th in a 2011 season plagued by off @-@ field issues involving 2010 Dally M Medallist Todd Carney ( who was later sacked by the Roosters at season 's end ) . However , a four @-@ game winning streak to end the season should bring hope for the 2012 season . Other high @-@ profile players including Nate Myles , Mark Riddell , Jason <unk> , Kane <unk> and Phil Graham all left the club at season 's end . 
 The Roosters endured a disappointing 2012 season , finishing 13th . Brian Smith resigned from the coaching role shortly after the Roosters ' season concluded with a loss to the minor premiers Canterbury , and also at season 's end captain <unk> <unk> left to join the Wests Tigers for 2013 . 
 The 2013 season saw new staff , a new coach , Trent Robinson , and several new players , including big signings Michael Jennings , James Maloney , Luke O 'Donnell and Sonny Bill Williams , arrive at the club . This culminated in the Roosters finishing the 2013 season with a 24 – 12 win over the South Sydney Rabbitohs , securing the minor premiership for the 2013 season and were the NRL 's best attacking and defensive team . The Roosters defeated the Manly @-@ Warringah Sea Eagles 4 – 0 , in week one of the finals , earning a week 's rest . The Roosters defeated the Newcastle Knights 40 – 14 in week three of the NRL finals , progressing to the 2013 NRL grand final , facing the Manly @-@ Warringah Sea Eagles , winning 26 – 18 . It was a great comeback by the Roosters , down by 10 points in the second half they went on to score three consecutive tries to seal the win and their 13th premiership . They then went on to win the 2014 World Club Challenge against Wigan 36 – 14 to claim the treble of club titles . No team in premiership history had come from a lower ladder position to win the following season ’ s title . 
 In 2015 , the Roosters claimed a third successive minor premiership , defeating the South Sydney Rabbitohs 30 – 0 . 
 = = Emblem = = 
 Eastern Suburbs did not traditionally sport a crest on their jerseys in the first half of the 20th century . Other clubs occasionally sported simple designs on their strip ; however , this was not seen consistently on all jerseys until the 1950s and 1960s . In 1967 , the club introduced the first logo , displaying the motto " Easts to Win " , following a winless season . The crest also incorporated a rooster or cockerel in the design ; one source suggested that this choice of mascot followed after the Roosters ' jersey design was inspired by the French national team 's jersey . Given that the French team 's mascot was affectionately known to supporters as le coq , " the rooster " , connections have been made as to the choosing of a rooster for Eastern Suburbs ' mascot . 
 In 1978 , the motto was replaced with the team 's name , " Eastern Suburbs " . This name was kept until 1994 , when the club changed its playing name to the " Sydney City Roosters " for the start of the 1995 season to expand the club 's widening fan base . In 2000 , the club changed its name to the " Sydney Roosters " . 
 Although marketing names have changed , the Roosters are still registered with the National Rugby League competition as the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club . 
 = = Colours = = 
 Red , white and blue have been the colours of every jersey design in the club 's history ; however , the jersey design has undergone several alterations . The red , white and blue colour scheme has traditionally been the colour combination for sporting teams representing Sydney 's Eastern Suburbs . Eastern Suburbs Rugby League club adopted these colours in 1908 , with its predecessor Rugby Union club , also known as Eastern Suburbs in the Sydney club Rugby Union , having played in the tri @-@ colours . The jersey worn in the first premiership season consisted of several hoops ; red stripes dominated over consecutive smaller white and blue stripes . Although the width and the order of these stripes have changed , the basic design has always been maintained . 
 During World War II , the design of the jersey was modified because the dye used to colour jerseys was needed for the war effort . This saw Eastern Suburbs playing in different colours and an altered design . Instead of using the traditional hoops , the side used a sky @-@ blue based jersey and a red and white V @-@ strip around the collar . This is the only noted time in the club 's history where the traditional deep blue , red and white combination was absent from the jersey . After the war , the V @-@ strip design reverted to the original blue that had been present in the original jerseys , and the single red and white stripes around the shirt 's chest were incorporated with a single white stripe surrounded by a red stripe on either side . This jersey appeared in the 1950s and remains the team 's base design . 
 Facing design clashes with other teams in the 1990s , the club adopted a jersey with a similar design to what became known as the " away jersey " , replacing the blue backing with white , and the outer red stripe with blue . As the club entered the new century , the team began to wear a " foundation jersey " . Although the design differs slightly from the jersey worn in the inaugural 1908 season , it did feature the traditional horizontal striped @-@ design . This jersey is normally worn when the Sydney Roosters face traditional rivals , such as the South Sydney Rabbitohs , or on special occasions such as Anzac Day when the team meets the St George Illawarra Dragons , the product of a team partly formed by the St. George Dragons . 
 = = Geographic area = = 
 The Sydney Roosters , namely the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club was formed , under its articles of association with the NSWRL , to represent the geographic areas in Sydney covering the Waverley , Randwick , Woollahra , Paddington , Darlinghurst and Vaucluse local government municipalities , as well as the eastern parts of the Sydney CBD . Despite some junior Rugby League boundaries being redrawn over the 107 @-@ year history of the code in Australia , these articles of association remain unchanged . As such , the Roosters represent a small area of Sydney . The Roosters home turf is also home to a large number of supporters of rival codes and thus is the most competitive sporting market in Australia , with the Roosters flying the flag for Rugby League in Sydney 's east . 
 = = Stadium = = 
 Most sources suggest that the Royal Agricultural Ground was often used as a home venue between 1908 and 1910 , before the club hosted matches at the Sydney Sports Ground from 1911 onwards . It was here that the team played all of their homes games up until 1986 , when the ground was demolished with the Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 to make way for Sydney 's main rectangular field , the Sydney Football Stadium . In 1987 , games were moved away to the Newtown Jets ' home ground , Henson Park , temporarily to await the completion of the Sydney Football Stadium . The team capitalised on this move , finishing second in the regular season . It was the only time between 1983 and 1995 that the side reached the finals . 
 In 1988 , the club moved to the newly built Sydney Football Stadium on the site of the old Sydney Sports Ground , opening the season with a 24 – 14 defeat at the hands of the St George Dragons in front of 19 @,@ 295 spectators on a wet night on 4 March 1988 . At the Sydney Football Stadium , the Roosters have a 59 % win record from 256 games with a 58 % and 55 % win record at their old grounds the Sydney Sports Ground and the Sydney Cricket Ground respectively . 
 In 2022 Allianz stadium will be upgraded at at cost of $ 450 million and is expected to take 4 years to complete . The Roosters are expected to play their Home games during this period at ANZ or Central Coast Stadium . Once competed the club is expected to call Allianz home again . 
 = = Supporters = = 
 The Sydney Roosters have a strong supporter group base across Australia . Aside from its traditional fan base in Sydney , which is most concentrated in its homeland in the affluent eastern suburbs . The club has an internet message board for supporters , " The Wall " , which has been the official forum since 1999 . The club has announced that " The Wall " will be closing as of late January 2012 . " The <unk> " is an unofficial site . 
 In 2013 the club tallied the fourth @-@ highest home attendance of all National Rugby League clubs ( behind the Brisbane Broncos ) with an average of 19 @,@ 368 spectators at the Sydney Football Stadium . 
 At the club 's home ground , the Sydney Football Stadium , the supporters congregate in distinct sections . The " <unk> Pen " , a designated area in Bay 35 , is the preferred location for the most animated fans . Members of the Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust are seated in the Members ' Stand on the western side of the ground , and season ticket holders are located just beneath the Members ' area , in Bays 12 – 14 . 
 In 2014 , the Roosters had nearly 17 @,@ 000 paying members , in addition to the 45 @,@ 550 members of the Roosters ' Leagues Club , which is the major benefactor of the football club . The Easts Leagues Club and the Sydney Roosters " operate as one entity " known as the Easts Group . Under this arrangement , the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club is the ' parent company ' of the Easts Group . The Football Club delegates , however , overarching responsibility for both football and leagues club operations to a single general manager who oversees the whole group 's performance . The leagues club group provides financial support to the football club , only where necessary , as in recent years the football club 's sponsorships and TV revenues are generally covering most Rugby League expenditures .

 George Bethune Adams ( April 3 , 1845 – October 9 , 1911 ) was a United States lawyer and United States District Judge specializing in admiralty law . He served in private practice , litigated before the Supreme Court of the United States , and served as a judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Adams was born in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Though under the minimum age , he enlisted in a Pennsylvania regiment in the United States Army in 1861 , and served for three months before returning to school . He reenlisted in 1863 when Robert E. Lee 's forces invaded Pennsylvania , and afterwards entered the Quartermaster 's Department of the Army , where he served until 1871 . He then worked as a merchant for several years . He read law and became a lawyer in Philadelphia in 1878 . He was thereafter in private practice in New York City from 1883 to 1901 , specializing in admiralty law at the firm of Beebe & Wilcox ; after the death of Judge Beebe in 1884 , he became a name partner and the firm was renamed Wilcox , Adams & Green . There , he litigated before the Supreme Court of the United States in admiralty cases such as The Kate . Adams was Secretary of the Union League Club of New York in 1894 and 1895 . 
 = = Appointment and judgeship = = 
 When Judge Addison Brown resigned his seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York , the members of the Admiralty Bar adopted a resolution in July 1901 asking the president to appoint Adams . He received a recess appointment to that seat from President William McKinley on August 30 , 1901 , and , following McKinley 's assassination on September 14 , was formally nominated to the seat by President Theodore Roosevelt on December 5 . The Senate confirmed Adams on December 17 , 1901 , and he received his commission the same day . 
 When appointed , Adams was the only judge in the district . The workload resulting from new federal bankruptcy laws caused his health to break down two years later ; though three other judges were appointed to the district , Adams 's health never fully recovered , but he served until his death , focusing on the maritime cases that were his specialty .

 In 1904 , Adams married the former Helen Jean Balfour . Adams died in Hague , New York on October 9 , 1911 , after two years ' illness . His will was fifteen words long : " I give and bequeath all my estate to my wife and appoint her my executrix . " There were no children . 
 Mrs. Adams served the cause of the New York Women 's League for Animals for decades after her husband 's death — despite being bitten by animals 71 times over the course of her service . She died in 1950 at the age of 101 . 
 = Valkyrie = 
 In Norse mythology , a valkyrie ( from Old Norse valkyrja " chooser of the slain " ) is one of a host of female figures who choose those who may die in battle and those who may live . Selecting half of those who die in battle , the valkyries bring their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain , Valhalla , ruled over by the god Odin ( the other half go to the goddess Freyja 's afterlife field Fólkvangr ) . There , the deceased warriors become einherjar ( Old Norse " single ( or once ) fighters " ) . When the einherjar are not preparing for the events of Ragnarök , the valkyries bear them mead . Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals , where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty , sometimes accompanied by ravens and sometimes connected to swans or horses . 
 Valkyries are attested in the Poetic Edda , a book of poems compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources ; the Prose Edda and Heimskringla ( by Snorri Sturluson ) , and Njáls saga , a Saga of Icelanders , all written in the 13th century . They appear throughout the poetry of skalds , in a 14th @-@ century charm , and in various runic inscriptions . 
 The Old English cognate terms wælcyrge and wælcyrie appear in several Old English manuscripts , and scholars have explored whether the terms appear in Old English by way of Norse influence , or reflect a tradition also native among the Anglo @-@ Saxon pagans . Scholarly theories have been proposed about the relation between the valkyries , the norns , and the dísir , all of which are supernatural figures associated with fate . Archaeological excavations throughout Scandinavia have uncovered amulets theorized as depicting valkyries . In modern culture , valkyries have been the subject of works of art , musical works , video games and poetry . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word valkyrie derives from Old Norse valkyrja ( plural <unk> ) , which is composed of two words ; the noun <unk> ( referring to the slain on the battlefield ) and the verb <unk> ( meaning " to choose " ) . Together , they mean " chooser of the slain " . The Old Norse valkyrja is cognate to Old English wælcyrge . Other terms for valkyries include <unk> ( Old Norse " wish maid " ) , appearing in the poem <unk> and Óðins <unk> ( Old Norse " Odin 's maids " ) , appearing in the Nafnaþulur . <unk> may be related to the Odinic name <unk> ( Old Norse , roughly meaning " wish <unk> " ) , referring to the fact that Odin receives slain warriors in Valhalla .

 Valkyries are mentioned or appear in the Poetic Edda poems Völuspá , Grímnismál , Völundarkviða , Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar , Helgakviða Hundingsbana I , Helgakviða Hundingsbana II and Sigrdrífumál .

 In stanza 30 of the poem Völuspá , a völva ( a travelling seeress in Germanic society ) tells Odin that " she saw " valkyries coming from far away who are ready to ride to " the realm of the gods " . The völva follows this with a list of six valkyries : Skuld ( Old Norse , possibly " debt " or " future " ) who " bore a shield " , Skögul ( " shaker " ) , Gunnr ( " war " ) , Hildr ( " battle " ) , Göndul ( " wand @-@ wielder " ) and <unk> ( " Spear @-@ Skögul " ) . Afterwards , the völva tells him she has listed the " ladies of the War Lord , ready to ride , valkyries , over the earth " . 
 In the poem Grímnismál , Odin ( disguised as Grímnir ) , tortured , starved and thirsty , tells the young Agnar that he wishes that the valkyries Hrist ( " shaker " ) and Mist ( " cloud " ) would " bear him a [ drinking ] horn " , then provides a list of 11 more valkyries who he says " bear ale to the einherjar " ; <unk> ( " axe @-@ age " ) , Skögul , Hildr , Þrúðr ( " power " ) , Hlökk ( " noise " , or " battle " ) , Herfjötur ( " host @-@ fetter " ) , Göll ( " tumult " ) , <unk> ( " spear @-@ fight " ) , <unk> ( " shield @-@ truce " ) , <unk> ( " council @-@ truce " ) and Reginleif ( " power @-@ truce " ) .

 A prose introduction in the poem Völundarkviða relates that the brothers Slagfiðr , Egil and Völund dwelt in a house sited in a location called <unk> ( " wolf dales " ) . There , early one morning , the brothers find three women spinning linen on the shore of the lake <unk> ( " wolf lake " ) , and " near them were their swan 's garments ; they were valkyries " . Two , daughters of King <unk> , are named Hlaðguðr svanhvít ( " swan @-@ white " ) and <unk> <unk> ( possibly meaning " all @-@ wise " or " strange creature " ) ; the third , daughter of <unk> of <unk> , is named Ölrún ( possibly meaning " beer rune " ) . The brothers take the three women back to their hall with them — Egil takes Ölrún , Slagfiðr takes Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund takes <unk> <unk> . They live together for seven winters , until the women fly off to go to a battle and do not return . Egil goes off in snow @-@ shoes to look for Ölrún , Slagfiðr goes searching for Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund sits in <unk> . 
 = = = = Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar = = = = 
 In the poem Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar , a prose narrative says that an unnamed and silent young man , the son of the Norwegian King <unk> and <unk> of <unk> , witnesses nine valkyries riding by while sitting atop a burial mound . He finds one particularly striking ; this valkyrie is detailed later in a prose narrative as Sváva , king Eylimi 's daughter , who " often protected him in battles " . The valkyrie speaks to the unnamed man , and gives him the name Helgi ( meaning " the holy one " ) . The previously silent Helgi speaks ; he refers to the valkyrie as " bright @-@ face lady " , and asks her what gift he will receive with the name she has bestowed upon him , but he will not accept it if he cannot have her as well . The valkyrie tells him she knows of a hoard of swords in <unk> , and that one of them is of particular importance , which she describes in detail . Further into the poem , Atli <unk> with the female jötunn Hrímgerðr . While flyting with Atli , Hrímgerðr says that she had seen 27 valkyries around Helgi , yet one particularly fair valkyrie led the band : 
 Three times nine girls , but one girl rode ahead , 
 white @-@ skinned under her helmet ; 
 the horses were trembling , from their manes 
 dew fell into the deep valleys , 
 hail in the high woods ; 
 good fortune comes to men from there ; 
 all that I saw was hateful to me . 
 After Hrímgerðr is turned to stone by the daylight , a prose narrative continues that Helgi , who is now king , goes to Sváva 's father — King Eylimi — and asks for his daughter . Helgi and Sváva are betrothed and love one another dearly . Sváva stays at home with King Eylimi , and Helgi goes raiding , and to this the narrative adds that Sváva " was a valkyrie just as before " . The poem continues , and , among various other events , Helgi dies from a wound received in battle . A narrative at the end of the poem says that Helgi and his valkyrie wife Sváva " are said to be reincarnated " . 
 = = = = Helgakviða Hundingsbana I = = = = 
 In the poem Helgakviða Hundingsbana I , the hero Helgi Hundingsbane sits in the corpse @-@ strewn battlefield of <unk> . A light shines from the fell , and from that light strike bolts of lightning . Flying through the sky , helmeted valkyries appear . Their waist @-@ length mail armour is drenched in blood ; their spears shine brightly : 
 Then light shone from <unk> , 
 and from that radiance there came bolts of lightning ; 
 wearing helmets at <unk> [ came the valkyries ] . 
 Their <unk> were drenched in blood ; 
 and rays shone from their spears . 
 In the stanza that follows , Helgi asks the valkyries ( who he refers to as " southern goddesses " ) if they would like to come home with the warriors when night falls ( all the while arrows were flying ) . The battle over , the valkyrie Sigrún ( " victory @-@ rune " ) , informs him from her horse that her father <unk> has betrothed her to <unk> , the son of king <unk> of the <unk> clan , who Sigrún deems unworthy . Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the <unk> clan to assist Sigrún in her plight to avoid her <unk> . Later in the poem , the hero Sinfjötli flyts with Guðmundr . Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been female , and <unk> that Guðmundr was " a witch , horrible , unnatural , among Odin 's valkyries " , adding that all of the einherjar " had to fight , headstrong woman , on your account " . Further in the poem , the phrase " the valkyrie 's airy sea " is used for " mist " . 
 Towards the end of the poem , valkyries again descend from the sky , this time to protect Helgi amid the battle at Frekastein . After the battle , all the valkyries fly away but Sigrún and wolves ( referred to as " the troll @-@ woman 's mount " ) consume corpses : 
 <unk> valkyries came down from the sky 
 — the noise of spears grew loud — they protected the prince ; 
 then said Sigrun — the wound @-@ giving valkyries flew , 
 the troll @-@ woman 's mount was feasting on the fodder of ravens : 
 The battle won , Sigrún tells Helgi that he will become a great ruler and pledges herself to him . 
 = = = = Helgakviða Hundingsbana II = = = = 
 At the beginning of the poem Helgakviða Hundingsbana II , a prose narrative says that King Sigmund ( son of Völsung ) and his wife Borghild ( of <unk> ) have a son named Helgi , who they named for Helgi <unk> ( the antagonist of the earlier Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar ) . After Helgi has killed King Hunding in stanza 4 , a prose narrative says that Helgi escapes , consumes the raw meat of cattle he has slaughtered on a beach , and encounters Sigrún . Sigrún , daughter of King <unk> , is " a valkyrie and rode through air and sea " , and she is the valkyrie Sváva reincarnated . In stanza 7 , Sigrún uses the phrase " fed the <unk> of Gunn 's sisters " . Gunnr and her sisters are valkyries , and these <unk> are ravens , who feed on the corpses left on the battlefield by warriors . 
 After stanza 18 , a prose narrative relates that Helgi and his immense fleet of ships are heading to Frekastein , but encounter a great storm . Lightning strikes one of the ships . The fleet sees nine valkyries flying through the air , among whom they recognise Sigrún . The storm abates , and the fleets arrive safely at land . Helgi dies in battle , yet returns to visit Sigrún from Valhalla once in a burial mound , and at the end of the poem , a prose epilogue explains that Sigrún later dies of grief . The epilogue details that " there was a belief in the pagan religion , which we now reckon [ is ] an old wives ' tale , that people could be reincarnated " and that " Helgi and Sigrun were thought to have been reborn " as another Helgi and valkyrie couple ; Helgi as Helgi <unk> and Sigrún as the daughter of Halfdan ; the valkyrie <unk> . The epilogue details that further information about the two can be found in the ( now lost ) work <unk> . 
 = = = = Sigrdrífumál = = = = 
 In the prose introduction to the poem Sigrdrífumál , the hero Sigurd rides up to <unk> and heads south towards " the land of the Franks " . On the mountain Sigurd sees a great light , " as if fire were burning , which blazed up to the sky " . Sigurd approaches it , and there he sees a <unk> with a banner flying overhead . Sigurd enters the <unk> , and sees a warrior lying there — asleep and fully armed . Sigurd removes the helmet of the warrior , and sees the face of a woman . The woman 's corslet is so tight that it seems to have grown into the woman 's body . Sigurd uses his sword Gram to cut the corslet , starting from the neck of the corslet downwards , he continues cutting down her sleeves , and takes the corslet off of her . 
 The woman wakes , sits up , looks at Sigurd , and the two converse in two stanzas of verse . In the second stanza , the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on her she could not break , and due to that spell she has been asleep a long time . Sigurd asks for her name , and the woman gives Sigurd a horn of mead to help him retain her words in his memory . The woman recites a heathen prayer in two stanzas . A prose narrative explains that the woman is named Sigrdrífa and that she is a valkyrie . 
 A narrative relates that Sigrdrífa explains to Sigurd that there were two kings fighting one another . Odin had promised one of these — <unk> — victory in battle , yet she had " brought down " <unk> in battle . Odin pricked her with a sleeping @-@ thorn in consequence , told her she would never again " fight victoriously in battle " , and condemned her to marriage . In response , Sigrdrífa told Odin she had sworn a great oath that she would never wed a man who knew fear . Sigurd asks Sigrdrífa to share with him her wisdom of all worlds . The poem continues in verse , where Sigrdrífa provides Sigurd with knowledge in inscribing runes , mystic wisdom , and prophecy . 
 = = = Prose Edda = = = 
 In the Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson , valkyries are first mentioned in chapter 36 of the book Gylfaginning , where the enthroned figure of High informs Gangleri ( King Gylfi in disguise ) of the activities of the valkyries and mentions a few goddesses . High says " there are still others whose duty it is to serve in Valhalla . They bring drink and see to the table and the ale cups . " Following this , High gives a stanza from the poem Grímnismál that contains a list of valkyries . High says " these women are called valkyries , and they are sent by Odin to every battle , where they choose which men are to die and they determine who has victory " . High adds that Gunnr ( " war " ) , <unk> , and Skuld — the last of the three he refers to as " the youngest norn " — " always ride to choose the slain and decide the outcome of battle " . In chapter 49 , High describes that when Odin and his wife Frigg arrived at the funeral of their slain son Baldr , with them came the valkyries and also Odin 's ravens . 
 References to valkyries appear throughout the book Skáldskaparmál , which provides information about skaldic poetry . In chapter 2 , a quote is given from the work Húsdrápa by the 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason . In the poem , Úlfr describes mythological scenes depicted in a newly built hall , including valkyries and ravens accompanying Odin at Baldr 's funeral feast : 
 There I perceive valkyries and ravens , 
 accompanying the wise victory @-@ tree [ Odin ] 
 to the drink of the holy offering [ Baldr 's funeral feast ] 
 Within have appeared these motifs . 
 Further in chapter 2 , a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem Eiríksmál is provided ( see the Fagrskinna section below for more detail about the poem and another translation ) : 
 What sort of dream is that , Odin ? 
 I dreamed I rose up before dawn 
 to clear up Val @-@ hall for slain people . 
 I aroused the <unk> , 
 bade them get up to strew the benches , 
 clean the beer @-@ cups , 
 the valkyries to serve wine 
 for the arrival of a prince . 
 In chapter 31 , poetic terms for referring to a woman are given , including " [ a ] woman is also referred to in terms of all Asyniur or valkyries or norns or dísir " . In chapter 41 , while the hero Sigurd is riding his horse Grani , he encounters a building on a mountain . Within this building Sigurd finds a sleeping woman wearing a helmet and a coat of mail . Sigurd cuts the mail from her , and she awakes . She tells him her name is Hildr , and " she is known as Brynhildr , and was a valkyrie " . 
 In chapter 48 , poetic terms for " battle " include " weather of weapons or shields , or of Odin or valkyrie or war @-@ kings or their clash or noise " , followed by examples of compositions by various skalds that have used the name of valkyries in said manner ( <unk> Hornklofi uses " Skögul 's din " for " battlefield " , <unk> <unk> uses " Gunnr 's fire " for " sword " and " Hlökk 's snow " for " battle " , Einarr Skúlason uses " Hildr 's sail " for " shield " and " Göndul 's crushing wind " for " battle " and Einarr <unk> uses " Göndul 's din " ) . Chapter 49 gives similar information when referring to weapons and armor ( though the term " death @-@ maidens " — Old Norse <unk> — instead of " valkyries " is used here ) , with further examples . In chapter 57 , within a list of names of ásynjur ( and after alternate names for the goddess Freyja are provided ) , a further section contains a list of " Odin 's maids " ; valkyries : Hildr , Göndul , Hlökk , Mist , Skögul . And then an additional four names ; <unk> , Eir , Hrist and Skuld . The section adds that " they are called norns who shape necessity " . 
 Some manuscripts of the feature Nafnaþulur section of Skáldskaparmál contain an extended list of 29 valkyrie names ( listed as the " valkyries of <unk> " — a name of Odin ) . The first stanza lists : Hrist , Mist , <unk> , Hlökk , <unk> , Göll , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Skuld , <unk> , Skögul and <unk> . The second stanza lists : <unk> , Göndul , Svipul , <unk> , Hildr , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Þrúðr , Reginleif , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The fragmentary skaldic poem <unk> ( generally accepted as authored by 9th century Norwegian skald <unk> Hornklofi ) features a conversation between a valkyrie and a raven , largely consisting of the life and deeds of Harald I of Norway . The poem begins with a request for silence among noblemen so that the skald may tell the deeds of Harald Fairhair . The narrator states that they once overheard a " high @-@ minded " , " golden @-@ haired " and " white @-@ armed " maiden speaking with a " glossy @-@ beaked raven " . The valkyrie considers herself wise , understands the speech of birds , is further described as having a white @-@ throat and sparkling eyes , and she takes no pleasure in men : 
 Wise thought her the valkyrie ; were welcome never 
 men to the bright @-@ eyed one , her who the birds ' speech knew well . 
 Greeted the light @-@ lashed maiden , the lily @-@ throated woman , 
 The <unk> 's @-@ skull @-@ cleaver as on cliff he was perching . 
 The valkyrie , previously described as fair and beautiful , then speaks to the gore @-@ drenched and corpse @-@ reeking raven : 
 " How is it , ye ravens — whence are ye come now 
 with beaks all gory , at break of morning ? 
 Carrion @-@ reek ye carry , and your claws are bloody . 
 Were ye near , at night @-@ time , where ye knew of corpses ? " 
 The black raven shakes himself , and he responds that he and the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs . The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald , and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas . At stanza 15 , a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald , and the raven responds in turn . This continues until the poem ends abruptly . 
 = = = Njáls saga = = = 
 In chapter 157 of Njáls saga , a man named Dörruð witnesses 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness . The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them . Dörruð goes to the hut , and looks through a chink in the wall . He sees that there are women within , and that they have set up a particular loom ; the heads of men are the weights , the entrails of men are the warp and weft , a sword is the shuttle , and the reels are composed of arrows . The women sing a song called Darraðarljóð , which Dörruð memorizes . 
 The song consists of 11 stanzas , and within it the valkyries weave and choose who is to be slain at the Battle of Clontarf ( fought outside Dublin in 1014 CE ) . Of the 12 valkyries weaving , six have their names given in the song : Hildr , <unk> , <unk> , Svipul , <unk> and Göndul . Stanza 9 of the song reads : 
 Now awful it is to be without , 
 as blood @-@ red rack races overhead ; 
 is the <unk> gory with warriors ' blood 
 as we valkyries war @-@ songs chanted . 
 At the end of the poem , the valkyries sing " start we swiftly with steeds <unk> — hence to battle with brandished swords ! " The prose narrative picks up again , and says that the valkyries tear their loom down and into pieces . Each valkyrie holds on to what she has in her hands . Dörruð leaves the chink in the wall and heads home , and the women mount their horses and ride away ; six to the south and six to the north . 
 = = = Heimskringla = = = 
 At the end of the Heimskringla saga Hákonar saga góða , the poem Hákonarmál by the 10th century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir is presented . The saga relates that king Haakon I of Norway died in battle , and although he is Christian , he requests that since he has died " among heathens , then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you " . The saga relates that shortly after Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon , he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike , and that his friends moved his body northward to <unk> in North Hordaland . Haakon was buried there in a large burial mound in full armour and his finest clothing , yet with no other valuables . Further , " words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men , and they put him on the way to Valhalla " . The poem Hákonarmál is then provided . 
 In Hákonarmál , Odin sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to " choose among the kings ' kinsmen " and who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla . A battle rages with great slaughter , and part of the description employs the kenning " Skögul 's @-@ <unk> " for " battle " . Haakon and his men die in battle , and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft . Göndul comments that " <unk> now the gods ' following , since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads " . Haakon hears " what the valkyries said " , and the valkyries are described as sitting " high @-@ hearted on horseback " , wearing helmets , carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them . A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul : 
 Hákon said : 
 " Why didst <unk> grudge us victory ? 
 though worthy we were for the gods to grant it ? " 
 <unk> said : 
 " ' Tis owing to us that the issue was won 
 and your <unk> fled . " 
 Skögul says that they shall now ride forth to the " green homes of the godheads " to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla . The poem continues , and Haakon becomes a part of the einherjar in Valhalla , awaiting to do battle with the monstrous wolf Fenrir .

 In chapter 8 of Fagrskinna , a prose narrative states that , after the death of her husband Eric Bloodaxe , Gunnhild Mother of Kings had a poem composed about him . The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as Eiríksmál . It describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death . The poem begins with comments by Odin ( as Old Norse Óðinn ) : 
 <unk> kind of a dream is it , ' said Óðinn , 
 in which just before daybreak , 
 I thought I cleared Valhǫll , 
 for coming of slain men ? 
 I waked the Einherjar , 
 bade valkyries rise up , 
 to strew the bench , 
 and scour the beakers , 
 wine to carry , 
 as for a king 's coming , 
 here to me I expect 
 heroes ' coming from the world , 
 certain great ones , 
 so glad is my heart . 
 The god Bragi asks where a thundering sound is coming from , and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking — as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla — and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand . Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe , who will soon arrive in Valhalla . Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall , if it is indeed he .

 The Old English wælcyrge and wælcyrie appear several times in Old English manuscripts , generally to translate foreign concepts into Old English . In the sermon Sermo Lupi ad Anglos , written by Wulfstan II , wælcyrie is used , and considered to appear as word for a human " sorceress " . An early 11th @-@ century manuscript of Aldhelm 's De <unk> <unk> ( Oxford , Bodleian library , Digby 146 ) glosses <unk> with wælcyrge ( with <unk> meaning " goddess " ) . <unk> is used to translate the names of the classical furies in two manuscripts ( Cotton Cleopatra A. iii , and the older Corpus Glossary ) . In the manuscript Cotton Cleopatra A. iii , wælcyrge is also used to gloss the Roman goddess Bellona . A description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army appears as <unk> <unk> ( meaning " dark one choosing the slain " ) . Scholarly theories debate whether these attestations point to an indigenous belief among the Anglo @-@ Saxons shared with the Norse , or if they were a result of later Norse influence ( see section below ) .

 Viking Age stylized silver amulets depicting women with long gowns , their hair pulled back , sometimes bearing forth drinking horns have been discovered throughout Scandinavia . These figures are commonly considered to represent valkyries or dísir . According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees , the amulets appear in Viking Age graves , and were presumably placed there because " they were thought to have protective powers " . 
 The Tjängvide image stone from the island of Gotland , Sweden features a rider on an eight @-@ legged horse , which may be Odin 's eight @-@ legged horse Sleipnir , being greeted by a female , which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla . The 11th century runestone U 1163 features a carving of a female bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd ( also depicted on the stone ) a drinking horn . 
 In 2013 , a small figure dated at around 800 AD was discovered in <unk> , Denmark by three amateur archaeologists . The figurine portrays a woman with long hair in a ponytail carrying a sword and a shield . Commenting on the figure , archaeologist Mogens Bo Henriksen said that " there can hardly be any doubt that the figure depicts one of Odin 's valkyries as we know them from the sagas as well as from Swedish picture stones from the time around <unk> " .

 Specific valkyries are mentioned on two runestones ; the early 9th century <unk> Runestone in Östergötland , Sweden , and the 10th @-@ century <unk> Runestone on the island of Öland , Sweden , which mentions the valkyrie Þrúðr . On the <unk> Runestone , a kenning is employed that involves a valkyrie riding a wolf as her steed : 
 That we tell the twelfth , where the horse of the Valkyrie [ literally " the horse of Gunn " ] sees food on the battlefield , where twenty kings are lying . 
 Among the Bryggen inscriptions found in Bergen , Norway , is the " valkyrie stick " from the late 14th century . The stick features a runic inscription intended as a charm . The inscription says that " I cut cure @-@ runes " , and also " help @-@ runes " , once against elves , twice against trolls , thrice against thurs and then a mention of a valkyrie occurs : 
 Against the harmful <unk> @-@ valkyrie , 
 so that she never shall , though she never would - 
 evil woman ! - injure ( ? ) your life . 
 This is followed by " I send you , I look at you , wolfish perversion , and unbearable desire , may distress descend on you and <unk> wrath . Never shall you sit , never shall you sleep ... ( that you ) love me as yourself . " According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees , the inscription " seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery , presumably upon the recipient of the charm rather than the baleful valkyrie " , and they posit the final line appears " to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman " . 
 MacLeod and Mees state that the opening lines of the charm correspond to the Poetic Edda poem Sigrdrífumál , where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa provides runic advice , and that the meaning of the term <unk> is unclear , but a cognate exists in Helgakviða Hundingsbana I where Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been a " <unk> @-@ valkyrie " . MacLeod and Mees believe the word means something like " supernatural sending " , and that this points to a connection to the Ragnhild Tregagás charm , where a valkyrie is also " sent forth " . 
 = = Valkyrie names = = 
 The Old Norse poems Völuspá , Grímnismál , Darraðarljóð and the Nafnaþulur section of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál , provide lists of valkyrie names . In addition , some valkyrie names appear solely outside of these lists , such as Sigrún ( who is attested in the poems Helgakviða Hundingsbana I and Helgakviða Hundingsbana II ) . Many valkyrie names emphasize associations with battle and , in many cases , on the spear — a weapon heavily associated with the god Odin . Some scholars propose that the names of the valkyries themselves contain no individuality , but are rather descriptive of the traits and nature of war @-@ goddesses , and are possibly the descriptive creations of skalds . 
 Some valkyrie names may be descriptive of the roles and abilities of the valkyries . The valkyrie name <unk> has been theorised as pointing to a connection to the name of the goddess <unk> , who is attested from a stone from 187 CE . The name Herfjötur has been theorised as pointing to the ability of the valkyries to place fetters . The name Svipul may be descriptive of the influence the valkyries have over wyrd or <unk> — a Germanic concept of fate .

 = = = Old English wælcyrge and Old English charms = = = 
 Richard North says that the description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army ( glossed as <unk> <unk> ) may have been directly influenced by the Old Norse concept of Valhalla , the usage of wælcyrge in De laudibus <unk> may represent a loan or loan @-@ translation of Old Norse valkyrja , but the Cotton Cleopatra A. iii and the Corpus Glossary instances " appear to show an Anglo @-@ Saxon conception of wælcyrge that was independent of contemporary Scandinavian influence " . 
 Two Old English charms mention figures that are theorised as representing an Anglo @-@ Saxon notion of valkyries or valkyrie @-@ like female beings ; Wið færstice , a charm to cure a sudden pain or stitch , and For a Swarm of Bees , a charm to keep honey bees from swarming . In Wið færstice , a sudden pain is attributed to a small , " shrieking " spear thrown with supernatural strength ( Old English <unk> ) by " fierce " loudly flying " mighty women " ( Old English <unk> <unk> ) who have ridden over a burial mound : 
 They were loud , yes , loud , 
 when they rode over the ( burial ) mound ; 
 they were fierce when they rode across the land . 
 Shield yourself now , you can survive this strife . 
 Out , little spear , if there is one here within . 
 It stood under / behind lime @-@ wood ( i.e. a shield ) , under a light @-@ coloured / light @-@ weight shield , 
 where those mighty women marshalled their powers , and they send shrieking spears . 
 Theories have been proposed that these figures are connected to valkyries . Richard North says that " though it is not clear what the poet takes these women to be , their female sex , riding in flight and throwing spears suggest that they were imagined in England as a female being analogous to the later Norse <unk> . " Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that Wið færstice was originally a battle spell that had , over time , been reduced to evoke " a prosaic stitch in the side " . Towards the end of For a Swarm of Bees , the swarming bees are referred to as " victory @-@ women " ( Old English <unk> ) : 
 Settle down , victory @-@ women , 
 never be wild and fly to the woods . 
 Be as mindful of my welfare , 
 as is each man of eating and of home . 
 The term " victory women " has been theorised as pointing to an association with valkyries . This theory is not universally accepted , and the reference has also been theorised as a simple metaphor for the " victorious sword " ( the stinging ) of the bees . 
 = = = Merseburg Incantation , fetters , dísir , <unk> and norns = = = 
 One of the two Old High German Merseburg Incantations call upon female beings — Idisi — to bind and hamper an army . The incantation reads : 
 Once the Idisi sat , sat here and there , 
 some bound fetters , some hampered the army , 
 some untied fetters : 
 Escape from the fetters , flee from the enemies . 
 The Idisi mentioned in the incantation are generally considered to be valkyries . Rudolf Simek says that " these Idisi are obviously a kind of valkyrie , as these also have the power to hamper enemies in Norse mythology " and points to a connection with the valkyrie name Herfjötur ( Old Norse " army @-@ fetter " ) . Hilda R. Davidson compares the incantation to the Old English Wið færstice charm and theorises a similar role for them both . 
 Simek says that the West Germanic term Idisi ( Old Saxon idis , Old High German itis , Old English <unk> ) refers to a " dignified , well respected woman ( married or unmarried ) , possibly a term for any woman , and therefore glosses exactly Latin <unk> " and that a link to the North Germanic term dísir is reasonable to assume , yet not undisputed . In addition , the place name <unk> ( meaning " plain of the Idisi " ) where forces commanded by Arminius fought those commanded by Germanicus at the Battle of the Weser River in 16 AD . Simek points to a connection between the name <unk> , the role of the Idisi in one of the two Merseburg Incantations and valkyries . 
 Regarding the dísir , Simek states that Old Norse dís appears commonly as simply a term for " woman " , just as Old High German itis , Old Saxon idis and Old English <unk> , and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess . According to Simek , " several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the dísir were valkyrie @-@ like guardians of the dead , and indeed in <unk> I 19 the valkyries are even called <unk> dísir " Odin 's dísir " . The dísir are explicitly called dead women in <unk> 28 and a secondary belief that the dísir were the souls of dead women ( see <unk> ) also underlies the <unk> of Icelandic folklore . Simek says that " as the function of the matrons was also extremely varied — fertility goddess , personal guardians , but also warrior @-@ goddesses — the belief in the dísir , like the belief in the valkyries , norns and matrons , may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female ( half- ? ) goddesses . " 
 Jacob Grimm states that , though the norns and valkyries are similar in nature , there is a fundamental difference between the two . Grimm states that a dís can be both norn and a valkyrie , " but their functions are separate and usually the persons . The norns have to pronounce the <unk> [ fate ] , they sit on their chairs , or they roam through the country among mortals , fastening their threads . Nowhere is it said that they ride . The <unk> ride to war , decide the issues of fighting , and conduct the fallen to heaven ; their riding is like that of heroes and gods [ ... ] . " 
 = = = Origins and development = = = 
 Various theories have been proposed about the origins and development of the valkyries from Germanic paganism to later Norse mythology . Rudolf Simek suggests valkyries were probably originally viewed as " demons of the dead to whom warriors slain on the battlefield belonged " , and that a shift in interpretation of the valkyries may have occurred " when the concept of Valhalla changed from a battlefield to a warrior 's paradise " . Simek says that this original concept was " superseded by the shield girls — Irish female warriors who lived on like the einherjar in Valhall . " Simek says that the valkyries were closely associated with Odin , and that this connection existed in an earlier role as " demons of death " . Simek states that due to the shift of concept , the valkyries became popular figures in heroic poetry , and during this transition were stripped of their " demonic characteristics and became more human , and therefore become capable of falling in love with mortals [ ... ] . " Simek says that the majority of the names of the valkyries point to a warlike function , that most of valkyrie names do not appear to be very old , and that the names " mostly come from poetic creativity rather than from real folk @-@ belief . " 
 MacLeod and Mees theorise that " the role of the corpse @-@ choosing valkyries became increasingly confused in later Norse mythology with that of the Norns , the supernatural females responsible for determining human destiny [ ... ] . " 
 Hilda Ellis Davidson says that , regarding valkyries , " evidently an elaborate literary picture has been built up by generations of poets and storytellers , in which several conceptions can be discerned . We recognise something akin to Norns , spirits who decide destinies of men ; to the <unk> , who could protect men in battle with their spells ; to the powerful female guardian spirits attached to certain families , bringing luck to youth under their protection ; even to certain women who armed themselves and fought like men , for whom there is some historical evidence from the regions round the Black Sea " . She adds that there may also be a memory in this of a " priestess of the god of war , women who officiated at the sacrificial rites when captives were put to death after battle . " 
 Davidson places emphasis on the fact that valkyrie literally means " chooser of the slain " . She compares Wulfstan 's mention of a " chooser of the slain " in his Sermo Lupi ad Anglos sermon , which appears among " a blacklist of sinners , witches and evildoers " , to " all the other classes whom he [ Wulfstan ] mentions " , and concludes as those " are human ones , it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well . " Davidson points out that Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan 's detailed account of a 10th @-@ century Rus ship funeral on the Volga River features an " old <unk> woman , massive and grim to look upon " ( who Fadlan refers to as the " Angel of Death " ) who organises the killing of the slave girl , and has two other women with her that Fadlan refers to as her daughters . Davidson says that " it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women , who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties . Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed , the idea that the god " chose " his victims , through the instrument of the priestesses , must have been a familiar one , apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war . " Davidson says that it appears that from " early times " the Germanic peoples " believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god , stirring up disorder , taking part in battle , seizing and perhaps devouring the slain . " 
 = = = Freyja and Fólkvangr = = = 
 The goddess Freyja and her afterlife field Fólkvangr , where she receives half of the slain , has been theorized as connected to the valkyries . Britt @-@ Mari Näsström points out the description in Gylfaginning where it is said of Freyja " whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain " , and interprets Fólkvangr as " the field of the Warriors " . Näsström notes that , just like Odin , Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield , and that her house is <unk> ( which she translates as " filled with many seats " ) , a dwelling that Näsström posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla . Näsström comments that " still , we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife . It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors , where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn and the other to Freyja . These examples indicate that Freyja was a war @-@ goddess , and she even appears as a valkyrie , literally ' the one who chooses the slain ' . " 
 Siegfried Andres <unk> comments that " in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm Fólkvangr , the goddess Freyja , however , emerges as the mythological role model for the <unk> [ sic ] and the dísir . "

 Valkyries have been the subjects of various poems , works of art and musical works . In poetry , valkyries appear in " Die Walküren " by H. Heine ( appearing in <unk> , 1847 ) , " Die Walküren " ( 1864 ) by H. v. Linge , " <unk> " ( appearing in <unk> Land , 1904 ) . 
 Works of art depicting valkyries include " Die Walküren " ( sketch , 1818 ) by J. G.

 " So Appalled " is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kanye West from his fifth studio album , My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ( 2010 ) . The song was produced by West , along with No I.D. and Mike Dean , and features verses by Jay @-@ Z , Pusha T , Cyhi the Prynce , Swizz Beatz , and RZA who all receive writing credits . The song explores topics such as the troubles produced from being famous , social concerns and features numerous pop culture references . 
 The posse cut received mostly positive reviews from music critics , with West and Jay @-@ Z 's verses being cited as the highlight . Critics generally praised the production of the song , though the verse given by Cyhi received a mixed reception . Originally released in an unmastered form through West 's GOOD Friday initiative , a weekly free music giveaway started by the rapper to promote the album . Following this , " So Appalled " made its way onto My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy with the addition of an extended verse . " So Appalled " charted on the Billboard Bubbling Under R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Singles singles chart . West performed the song with Jay @-@ Z at their Watch the Throne Tour and by Pusha T on his own tour . 
 = = Background = = 
 " So Appalled " was first released on September 24 , 2010 , and was the seventh song to be featured on West 's GOOD Fridays , a music giveaway that provided free MP3 downloads every week . It was originally believed to be a song for West and Jay @-@ Z 's collaborative album Watch the Throne , but it was later confirmed not to be . The song would later find its way onto West 's fifth studio album , My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy along with two other GOOD Friday songs . The version on the album was altered production @-@ wise and was longer , and featured a sample of Manfred Mann Earth Band 's song " You Are – I Am " . The song was released with two covers , one with a famous photo of a model vomiting red nail polish , taken by Guy Bourdin ; and the other containing the same image , with dimmed lighting and obscured by thick red letters . Before its release the song was leaked online and was nearly scrapped . 
 = = = Recording = = = 
 The majority of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was recorded in Oahu , Hawaii , a trait that " So Appalled " shares . Following several media controversies , West decided to record his next album in a reclusive manner only working with artists he considered himself familiar with . Amongst the various artists invited down to Hawaii to record songs for the album was Pusha T , a rapper known for the hip @-@ hop duo Clipse . While in Hawaii , Pusha @-@ T commented that the very first thing he recorded was his verse for " So Appalled " . He favorably compared recording with West with another producer he was used to working with , Pharrell Williams , commenting that he enjoyed how the process was more of a canvas . 
 When working with other producers usually a majority of the track was already done by the time he got to the recording studio , but with West , the process was more creative in nature . Pusha described the recording process with West as a " roller coast " and stated that he never knew what to expect while working with the producer . Upon hearing the production of the song , Pusha @-@ T commented that it was so good it persuaded him to write a particularly inspired verse . On the production of " So Appalled " , he said " it 's Kanye , the beat brings the ghost out of you . " The rapper described his verse as " self @-@ explanatory " and stated that it was one of his favorite of his career . Pusha T called his verse " his personal favorite " and that the track was originally supposed to be just him and Kanye . When the song was finished , Pusha @-@ T was so impressed with the track that he argued with West to include it on his album , stating that the song was so good it didn 't matter whether or not it had leaked . He commented ; 
 " I had already raved over the record because it leaked . I was like listen , there is no way this cant [ sic ] be on your album , you ’ d have to be crazy . He was like ' Really , you think so ? ' I was like c ’ mon man we got to stop treating rap like oh it came out it ’ s dead . When it ’ s good , we have to make people love it and digest it . We can ’ t treat this like mixtape throwaways like everybody else does . Everybody else does half @-@ ass music . So what people don ’ t know is that what Kanye did during that album is literally , I walked into the studio and I had the pick of 17 records and he was like do what you want to do to any of these , do what you like . " 
 One of the producers and guest appearances on the song is RZA , frontman of the hip @-@ hop group Wu @-@ Tang Clan . RZA spoke positively of West , viewing that he embodied the mentality of the Wu @-@ Tang Clan . RZA sent several beats to West , including some that he cited as being edgy , because he felt that West was the type who could work well on more forceful production , including the brooding " So Appalled " . The song was nearly featured on Last Train to Paris , a studio album by Diddy . According to another producer on the song , No I.D. , it was offered to both Jay @-@ Z and Diddy before it leaked . West <unk> over the track for fun and found that he actually liked it enough to ultimately use it himself , stating that it would make a good group song . Cyhi the Prynce 's verse only appeared on the song because he " tricked " West . Originally he was only supposed to deliver a quick hook , but at the time West was tired and let Cyhi record his verse alone . When West awoke and played back the tape , he was surprised to find that Cyhi had recorded an entire verse . Impressed with it , West decided to include it on the track anyway . The song reportedly offended M.C. Hammer , who Jay @-@ Z references on the line " I spent another 30 / Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can ’ t hurt me " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " So Appalled " has been described as an epic posse cut featuring a large roster of performers . West uses his verse to address his past critics and comment on his status as a celebrity . West 's performance on the song is notably intense , forcefully rapping lines such as " we above the law , we don 't give a fuck ' bout y 'all / I got dogs that 'll chew a fucking hole through the wall . " Swizz Beatz sets the tone of the song using several ad @-@ libs such as " one hand in the air , if you don 't really care " and the line " this shit is fucking ridiculous " which is repeated several times throughout the song , delivered by nearly every rapper . The second verse is delivered by Jay @-@ Z , who spends the majority of his verse deconstructing the hate that surrounds fame and poses the question , " would you rather be underpaid or overrated ? " Jay @-@ Z comments on how a career in the music industry creates many opponents . The third verse is delivered by Pusha T , who muses on cocaine dealing . 
 The song contains numerous pop culture references , like to the film The Dark Knight , the breakfast cereal Cheerios , the business figure Donald Trump , rapper M.C. Hammer and " We Major " , a song from West 's album Late Registration . On the unconventional structure of the song , Sputnikmusic 's Channing Freeman said that verses were " very lengthy - Kanye appears within the first minute and then drops out for good - but the droning beat is so mesmerizing that it 's barely even noticeable . " Andy Gill of The Independent explained the use of several guest appearances , writing " Kanye has never been short on ambition or ego , so it 's no surprise he should have his guests ( including such hip @-@ hop luminaries as Jay @-@ Z , Swizz Beats and RZA ) queue up on " So Appalled " to confirm in turn how ' this shit is fucking ridiculous ' " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " So Appalled " received mostly favorable reviews from contemporary critics . David Browne of Time wrote that he felt that the track was " built on rumbling tanks of pianos and strings " and that it sounded as if West was " marching into the apocalypse . " David Amidon of PopMatters compared the production to West 's album Late Registration which found West " inviting his friend Jon Brion to impart slices of film scoring to the odds and ends of his tracks " . He commented that much like every song on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy , the song " contains an underscore as ambitious as the beats upfront " , concluding that tracks " Hell of a Life " and " So Appalled " alone " carry enough auditory sugar to make listening to this album on any regular sort of listening device almost a fool ’ s errand . " 
 Jayson Rodriguez of MTV praised the song , reporting " this all @-@ star cipher is a backpackers dream as Ye 's GOOD Music soldiers fire away with resolve . But the Brooklyn icon , Jay @-@ Z , steals the show with an edgy verse dismissing his critics with a 16 that 's as pushy as a New Yorker during rush hour . Please , Hammer , stop replying . " Slant Magazine 's Cole Mathews thought that the song returned West to his hard rap origins , commenting " with the posse cuts ' Monster ' and ' So Appalled ' , Kanye kicks out the two hardest rap tracks of his career . " Becky Bain of <unk> described the song as a " dramatic , gloomy epic of a tune that has each artist taking turns at the mic . " He expressed that trying to find Kanye ’ s verse was " virtually a musical Where ’ s Waldo " . It was noted for its impressive roster of features and was described as " another Kanye West @-@ helmed all @-@ star <unk> " by MTV 's <unk> Ziegbe . He noted that Cyhi managed to hold his own against several much more regarded rappers . Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes described the song as a super @-@ sized cypher , stating that the track was packed with plenty of " <unk> " from the group of rappers . 
 Pitchfork Media 's Tom Breihan criticized Cyhi 's lyrical contributions to the song , stating " On the otherwise amazing Kanye track ' So Appalled ' , <unk> offers a black hole of a verse . His most memorable line ( ' If God had a iPod , I 'd be on his playlist ' ) mostly just raises questions . Like : Why does God 's iPod only have one playlist ? " IGN 's Chad Grischow described the song as a star @-@ studded banger , and cited Jay @-@ Z 's verse as the most notable . In addition , Grischow stated that the song was unfocused . Chris Martins of Spin reported that much like the track " Monster " , the guest appearances on the song had the potential to be toned down . Chicago Sun @-@ Times writer Thomas Conner cited the line " praise due to the most high , Allah / Praise due to the most fly , Prada " as an example of genius songwriting on West 's part . The song charted at 14 on the Bubbling Under R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Singles chart as reported by Billboard , however it only spent one week on the chart . The song also appeared on the South Korean Gaon Chart at number 95 . 
 = = = Reaction from M.C. Hammer ( aka King Hammer ) = = = 
 M.C. Hammer promised to release a track on October 31 , 2010 in response to Jay @-@ Z 's " So Appalled " lyrics which he felt attacked him . Jay @-@ Z raps a verse targeting Hammer about his financial dilemma in the 1990s . Within it Jay says : ' Hammer went broke so you know I 'm more focused / I lost 30 mil ' so I spent another 30 / ' Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can 't hurt me ' . Hammer addressed his displeasure about the diss on Twitter , claiming he would react to Jay @-@ Z on Halloween . 
 Hammer released a sample of his " beef " with Jay @-@ Z ( aka ' Hell Boy ' according to Hammer ) in a brief teaser trailer called " Better Run Run " by ' King Hammer ' . At one point , it was uncertain if his reaction would be a film video , a music video or a combination of both . Regardless , he claimed he would show evidence that ' Jigga worships the devil ' . It 's possible that Jay @-@ Z was offended by an analogy Hammer was conveying in an earlier interview in response to " D.O.A. ( Death of Auto @-@ Tune ) " on AllHipHop . 
 On November 1 , Hammer 's song and video titled " Better Run Run ! " hit the web in retaliation to Jay @-@ Z 's September 2010 diss towards him . M.C. accuses Jigga of being in league ( and in the studio ) with Satan — and then Hammer defeats the devil and forces Jay to be baptized . Speaking on the video , Jacob O 'Gara of Ethos Magazine wrote : " What ’ s more likely is that this feud is the last chapter in the tragic cautionary tale of M.C. Hammer , a tale that serves as a warning to all present and future kings of hip @-@ hop . Keep your balance on the pedestal and wear the crown strong or you ’ ll have the Devil to pay . " 
 In an interview with BBC 's DJ Semtex , Jay said he didn 't mean the verses as a personal attack . " I didn 't know that [ Hammer 's financial status ] wasn 't on the table for discussion ! " he said . " I didn 't know I was the first person ever to say that ... " He continued , " When I say things , I think people believe me so much that they take it a different way — it 's , like , not rap anymore at that point . I say some great things about him in the book I have coming out [ Decoded ] — that 's wasn 't a cheap plug , " he laughed . " He 's gonna be embarrassed , I said some really great things about him and people 's perception of him . But it is what it is , he took it that wrong way , and I didn 't know I said anything wrong ! "

 = Cyclone Haruna = 
 Tropical Cyclone Haruna was a deadly storm that produced widespread flooding and a disease outbreak in southwestern Madagascar . The ninth system of the season , Haruna developed in the Mozambique channel in the middle of February 2013 between Mozambique and southwestern Madagascar . Initially moving northward over Mozambique , the disturbance later moved slowly southward , gradually strengthening into the eighth named storm of the season and later into an intense tropical cyclone . The Météo @-@ France office in Réunion ( MFR ) – the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in the basin – estimated the cyclone attained peak 10 minute sustained winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Haruna made landfall near Morombe in southwestern Madagascar on February 22 . It weakened significantly while crossing the country , and MFR discontinued advisories on February 24 after the storm had emerged into the Indian Ocean . 
 Before Haruna struck Madagascar , a pre @-@ existing system produced deadly flooding , and when the cyclone crossed the country , it added additional rainfall to the region . Flooding was worst in Toliara where a dyke burst , flooding much of the town and leaving residents without water or power . Many villages in southwestern Madagascar lost access to clean water , prompting various international agencies to deploy teams to decontaminate wells . Haruna destroyed 7 @,@ 402 houses , which left 13 @,@ 882 people homeless . Most of the displaced people were able to leave their shelters by early April . The cyclone damaged rice and maize crops along the coast , although there were extended residual effects when a locust outbreak occurred , affecting half of Madagascar 's farmlands by July 2013 . Throughout Madagascar , Haruna killed 26 people and injured 127 directly , and there were outbreaks of various diseases in the storm 's aftermath . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In the middle of February , an area of convection , or thunderstorms , persisted in the Mozambique channel . It had an associated circulation and rainbands to the east of the center , and was related to the monsoon trough . The system was located within an area of warm sea surface temperatures of over 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) and steadily decreasing wind shear . A ridge to the south caused the system to initially track to the north . By February 16 , the system had moved over Mozambique and turned to the east , although by that time it had become better organized with the convection wrapping into the center . Subsequently , the system moved southward due to a weakness in the ridge , with conditions favorable for tropical cyclogenesis such as low wind shear and good divergence . On February 18 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert , and at 1200 UTC that day , Météo @-@ France ( MFR ) initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 09 . 
 Upon being classified , the disturbance had a broad circulation that was difficult to locate , with moderate convection in its eastern periphery . The thunderstorms organized further , and MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on February 19 . Three hours later , the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 16S , and at 0600 UTC that day , MFR upgraded the depression to a moderate tropical storm after an advanced scatterometer indicated winds of over 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) ; as a result , the National Weather Service of Madagascar gave it the name Haruna . By that time , the circulation had become better organized with increased rainbands , and with an anticyclone aloft , the storm developed well @-@ defined outflow . The structure of Haruna continued to become more symmetrical with a large radius of maximum winds , developing a ragged eye early on February 20 . Based on the improved appearance , MFR upgraded Haruna to a severe tropical storm at 0000 UTC that day . About 12 hours later , the agency upgraded Haruna further to tropical cyclone status , with 10 minute winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . That day , an approaching trough weakened the ridge to the south , causing the cyclone to slow and move erratically . While Haruna was approaching the southwestern coast of Madagascar , it developed a 120 km ( 75 mi ) wide eye , and the eyewall passed over Europa Island . Initially , MFR estimated that the storm would intensify to intense tropical cyclone status , and the agency assessed that Haruna reached 10 minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) on February 20 . The next day , JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . In contrast , MFR estimated at that time that the cyclone had peaked when the eyewall thunderstorms warmed , followed by the eye becoming less organized and the winds decreasing . 
 While moving slowly to the east @-@ southeast , Haruna re @-@ intensified early on February 22 to its previous MFR peak intensity . At around 0230 UTC that day , the cyclone made landfall about 55 km ( 35 mi ) south of Morombe in southwestern Madagascar . Haruna quickly weakened below cyclone status , and while over land it accelerated to the southeast . On February 23 , Haruna weakened to an overland depression with 10 minute winds of around 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) . A few hours later , the system emerged into the Indian Ocean near Fort Dauphin as a tropical disturbance . With generally favorable conditions , convection reorganized slightly and the system redeveloped outflow to the south . Early on February 24 , Haruna re @-@ intensified into a moderate tropical storm , although soon after it weakened again due to cooler waters , increasing shear , and dry air . At 1200 UTC , MFR issued its last advisory after Haruna began losing tropical characteristics , designating it as a subtropical depression . The next day , the JTWC also discontinued advisories on the storm , noting that Haruna was dissipating about 665 km ( 415 mi ) south @-@ southwest of Réunion . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 On Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel , Haruna produced wind gusts of 144 km / h ( 90 mph ) during the passage of the eyewall . Before the cyclone struck Madagascar , the intertropical convergence zone had caused flooding in the country that killed four people and caused widespread road disruption . Officials prepared by collecting supplies in the capital Antananarivo beginning on February 20 , and sending an emergency crew to the expected landfall location . Residents were evacuated using boats and canoes to shelters . 
 For several days while offshore western Madagascar , Haruna dropped greater than normal rainfall . The storm ultimately made landfall about 15 hours faster than anticipated . Winds and rainfall from Haruna damaged houses and power systems , and also damaged 265 classrooms and 16 health facilities . There was also damage to the rice and maize crops from high winds near the coast , causing food shortages . Rains from the storm caused a dyke along the Fiherenana River to break , which flooded a large region and forced about 6 @,@ 000 people to evacuate their homes . The flooding from the dyke break was worst in Toliara , where most residents lost access to fresh water and power . Flooding in the city caused the temporarily closure of the airport there . The town of Morombe was temporarily isolated after the road was blocked . Power outages affected Morombe , Toliara , <unk> , and <unk> Sud . Downed trees had affected roads near Toliara but were quickly removed . About 1 @,@ 050 houses were flooded , another 691 lost their roofs , and 7 @,@ 402 were destroyed , leaving 13 @,@ 882 people homeless . Overall , Haruna killed 26 people and injured another 127 . 
 There were initial difficulties in distributing aid to areas of southwestern Madagascar due to prevailing unsettled weather , along with fuel shortages . Workers used boats to rescue people in flooded areas . Members of the Madagascar Armed Forces , along with about 200 Red Cross volunteers , assisted in evacuations and aid distribution , and the Red Cross also provided free medical consultations to thousands of people . Following the storm , there were increased levels of malaria , dysentery , and childhood diarrhea in the area around Toliara , and there was a locust outbreak . Increased locust activity persisted into the summer , and had been occurring since late 2012 ; this caused continued food shortages , and by July the locusts were affecting about half of the country 's farmlands . To prevent further spreading of disease , officials provided vaccinations and sprayed insecticide . In isolated villages in southwestern Madagascar , residents faced food shortages , while in some areas , the water supply was contaminated . Within a few weeks of the storms , many residents whose dwellings were not destroyed were able to return to their homes . In Toliara , about 4 @,@ 000 students were initially unable to return to school due to being displaced . In the middle of March , 1 @,@ 948 displaced people stayed in a military camp or two schools , but most returned home by early April . Repairs to the dyke in Toliara began in early April , and were expected to take about a month and a half . 
 On February 23 , the prime minister of Madagascar issued an appeal to the international community for assistance . In Toliara , United Nations agencies , including the World Food Programme , and non @-@ governmental organizations worked together to provide food for 3 @,@ 000 people in six shelters . The World Food Programme sent a truck with 1 @,@ 050 tons of food to Toliara , including corn and legumes . A few days after Haruna struck , the French Red Cross sent a ship to Toliara with 35 tons of supplies , including for housing and water . The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies authorized funds to help up to 10 @,@ 000 affected residents . Handicap International provided food and shelter to 547 people in Toliara . Action Against Hunger sent a plane with 15 tons of supplies , including water treatment units , to Madagascar after the storm . By March 20 , 1 @,@ 330 wells were disinfected by various crews . On March 1 , the European Commission donated € 200 @,@ 000 for immediate relief . The Red Crescent Society of the United Arab Emirates sent about 80 tonnes of food , medicine , and building supplies to the country .

 Strong was appointed Head of the German Section at MI14 in August 1939 . He liaised with French intelligence until the Fall of France in June 1940 . Thereafter , his section was concerned with the prospect of a German invasion of Britain . In April 1941 , he assumed command of the 4th / 5th Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers , part of the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division . Then , in March 1942 , he became Brigadier General Staff ( BGS ) for Intelligence at General Alan Brooke 's GHQ Home Forces . For his services , Strong was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire . 
 In March 1943 , Strong was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence ( G @-@ 2 ) at General Dwight Eisenhower 's Allied Force Headquarters ( AFHQ ) , replacing Brigadier Eric Mockler @-@ Ferryman , whose over @-@ reliance on Ultra sources had led to a misinterpretation of the enemy 's intentions leading up to the disastrous Battle of the Kasserine Pass . Strong got on well with Eisenhower and his chief of staff , Major General Bedell Smith in particular , and Americans in general . Stephen Ambrose wrote : 
 Strong had an explosive laugh , an appreciation of the wisecrack , and an easy acceptance of the West Pointers ' rough language and casual manner rare in British officers . In his memoirs he endeared himself to all those from the New World side of the Atlantic Ocean who had been put off by British stuffiness and snobbery when he remarked " The best time in a man 's life is when he gets to like Americans . " 
 In August 1943 , Smith and Strong flew to Lisbon via Gibraltar in civilian clothes , where they met with Generale di <unk> Giuseppe Castellano at the British embassy . While Castellano had hoped to arrange terms for Italy to join the United Nations , Smith was empowered to draw up an armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces , but was unable to negotiate political matters . Smith and Strong subsequently negotiated for the Allies with Castellano in Sicily over the terms over Italian surrender . On 3 September 1943 , Smith and Castellano signed the agreed text on behalf of Eisenhower and Pietro Badoglio respectively at Cassibile , Sicily . For his work at AFHQ , Strong was promoted to major general on 11 January 1944 , and awarded the Legion of Merit by the United States in March 1944 . 
 = = = Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force = = = 
 When Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Allied Commander in December 1943 , he naturally wished to take key members of his AFHQ staff , including Strong , with him to his new assignment . On New Year 's Eve , Smith met with Alan Brooke , now Chief of the Imperial General Staff , to discuss the transfer of key British staff from AFHQ to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) . Brooke made some concessions but refused to transfer Strong , whom he believed could not be spared from the Mediterranean . A heated exchange resulted , with Smith demanding Brooke explain how Operation Overlord could be a success if the British Army withheld its best talent . Later Brooke complained to Eisenhower about Smith 's behaviour . Accordingly , another AFHQ hand , Brigadier John Whiteley , became G @-@ 2 at SHAEF . However Eisenhower and Smith eventually had their way , going over Brooke 's head to Prime Minister Winston Churchill , and Strong assumed the post on 25 May 1944 , with Brigadier General Thomas J. Betts as his deputy . 
 As it turned out , the relationship between SHAEF and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery 's 21st Army Group was far from cordial , with the Deputy Supreme Commander , Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder , and the Deputy Chief of Staff , Lieutenant General Frederick Morgan , both frequently critical of Montgomery . In September 1944 an intelligence crisis similar to Kasserine arose , when the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park did not locate the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg in the Arnhem area , but information from the Dutch resistance and a consequent photo reconnaissance ordered by Major Brian Urquhart , the Intelligence Officer at I Airborne Corps , confirmed the German presence . Strong and Smith then flew to Brussels to warn Montgomery . However , Montgomery decided to accept the risk rather than alter the plans for Operation Market Garden . 
 Heavy opposition from the two SS panzer divisions in the area proved to be a critical factor not only in preventing the British 1st Airborne Division from holding the Rhine Bridge at Arnhem , but also imposed serious delays on the capture of the bridges at Nijmegen by the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and the advance of the armoured units of the British XXX Corps . For SHAEF , the outcome meant that attention had to turn to the Battle of the Scheldt to open the approaches to Antwerp and to building up resources for an invasion of Germany in 1945 . 
 In December 1944 , Strong identified a large German reserve . The Germans devised an elaborate deception plan , and because the troops were being assembled inside Germany , they relied on secure phone and teleprinter lines rather than radio . Ultra and signal intelligence therefore dried up . Ultra detected German hoarding of fuel , but this was misinterpreted as a response to a critical shortage rather than building up a reserve . However , the withdrawal of armoured units from the front line was duly noted , and by 20 November , using agents , aircraft and prisoner interrogations , SHAEF had located and enumerated the divisions of the Fifth Panzer Army east of Aachen and the Sixth Panzer Army east of the Roer River . Strong informed Smith that the German armoured reserves might be sent to the Eastern Front , or used for a counterattack against an Allied penetration of the front , but might also be used for a counterattack during a period of bad weather . In early December , SHAEF detected tank movements in the Bitburg area , and Strong became worried about a possible counterattack against the Allied lines in the Ardennes or the Vosges . Smith sent Strong to warn Lieutenant General Omar Bradley , the commander of the 12th Army Group , of the danger . Bradley 's response was succinct : " Let them come . " 
 The magnitude and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive came as a shock and Strong was criticised for failing to predict it . However Smith defended Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm , feeling that Strong have given ample warning , which had been discounted or disregarded by himself and others . By 19 December , Strong had become concerned that the Germans were going to split Bradley 's armies , and he and Whiteley – who had already received Monty 's opinion on the matter – went to Smith , recommending that the armies north of the Ardennes be transferred from Bradley to Montgomery 's command . Smith realised the military and political implications of this , and knew that such a recommendation had to come from an American officer . On 20 December , Smith spoke to Eisenhower , who deferred judgement until the morning staff meeting . Eisenhower then phoned Bradley and Montgomery and ordered it . The decision was greatly resented by many Americans , particularly at 12th Army Group . 
 On 15 April 1945 , Nazi governor ( ' Reichskommissar ' ) of the Netherlands , Arthur Seyss @-@ Inquart , offered to open Amsterdam to food and coal shipments to ease the suffering of the civilian population . Smith and Strong , representing SHAEF , along with Major General Ivan Susloparov , representing the USSR , Prince Bernhard of Lippe @-@ Biesterfeld , representing the Dutch government , and Major General Sir Francis de Guingand , from 21st Army Group , met with Seyss @-@ Inquart in the Dutch village of <unk> on 30 April . They successfully negotiated for the provision of food to the starving Dutch civilian population in the cities in the west of the country , and opened discussions for the peaceful and complete German capitulation in the Netherlands that would follow on 5 May . 
 Another set of negotiations , that of the surrender of German armed forces , were conducted in May 1945 . Smith and Strong met with the representatives of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht , Generaloberst Alfred Jodl and Generaladmiral Hans @-@ Georg von Friedeburg . Once again , Strong acted as translator . Strong was present when , on 7 May , Smith signed the surrender document , along with <unk> and the French representative , Major General François <unk> . 
 For his services at SHAEF , Strong was mentioned in despatches , appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath , and awarded the United States Distinguished Service Medal , and other foreign awards , including the French Croix de Guerre and Légion d 'honneur , and the Order of the Red Banner from the USSR .

 In August 1945 , Strong became Deputy Director of the Political Warfare Executive , succeeding Sir Bruce Lockhart as its head a month later . With the elevation of Montgomery to Chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1946 , the career prospects of officers who had served at SHAEF , like Morgan , Gale , Whiteley and Strong , became dim , and Strong retired from the Army with the rank of major general on 9 May 1947 to become a civil servant . 
 He was initially appointed Director General of the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office . He was the first Director of the Joint Intelligence Bureau at the Ministry of Defence from 1948 until 1964 , when he became the first Director General of Intelligence at the Ministry of Defence . He was knighted on 1 January 1952 , and became a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1966 . He retired on 9 May 1966 . 
 Strong became a director of Eagle Star Insurance and other companies . He wrote two books , his memoir , Intelligence at the Top ( 1970 ) , and Men of Intelligence ( 1970 ) . Unfortunately , both were written before the Ultra secret was revealed in 1974 . In 1979 he married a widow , Brita <unk> <unk> . Their marriage produced no children .

 = Lady Macbeth = 
 Lady Macbeth is a character in Shakespeare 's Macbeth ( <unk> – 1607 ) . She is the wife of the play 's antagonist , Macbeth , a Scottish nobleman . After goading him into committing regicide , she becomes Queen of Scotland , but later suffers pangs of guilt for her part in the crime . She dies off @-@ stage in the last act , an apparent suicide . 
 According to some genealogists , Lady Macbeth and King Duncan 's wife were siblings or cousins , where Duncan 's wife had a stronger claim to the throne than Lady Macbeth . It was this that incited her jealousy and hatred of Duncan . 
 The character 's origins lie of the accounts of Kings Duff and Duncan in Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) , a history of Britain familiar to Shakespeare . Shakespeare 's Lady Macbeth appears to be a composite of two separate and distinct personages in Holinshed 's work : Donwald 's nagging , murderous wife in the account of King Duff , and Macbeth 's ambitious wife Gruoch of Scotland in the account of King Duncan . 
 Lady Macbeth is a powerful presence in the play , most notably in the first two acts . Following the murder of King Duncan , however , her role in the plot diminishes . She becomes an uninvolved spectator to Macbeth 's plotting , and a nervous hostess at a banquet dominated by her husband 's hallucinations . Her fifth act sleepwalking scene is a turning point in the play , and her line , " Out , damned spot ! , " has become a phrase familiar to many speakers of the English language . The report of her death late in the fifth act provides the inspiration for Macbeth 's " Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow " speech . 
 Analysts see in the character of Lady Macbeth the conflict between femininity and masculinity , as they are impressed in cultural norms . Lady Macbeth suppresses her instincts toward compassion , motherhood , and fragility — associated with femininity — in favour of ambition , ruthlessness , and the <unk> pursuit of power . This conflict colours the entire drama , and sheds light on gender @-@ based preconceptions from Shakespearean England to the present . 
 The role has attracted countless notable actors over the centuries , including Sarah Siddons , Charlotte Melmoth , Helen Faucit , Ellen Terry , Jeanette Nolan , Vivien Leigh , Simone Signoret , Vivien Merchant , Glenda Jackson , Francesca Annis , Judith Anderson , Judi Dench , Renée O 'Connor , Tabu , Keeley Hawes , Alex Kingston , Angela Bassett and Marion Cotillard . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Shakespeare 's Lady Macbeth appears to be a composite of two personages found in the account of King Duff and in the account of King Duncan in Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) . In the account of King Duff , one of his captains , Donwald , suffers the deaths of his kinsmen at the orders of the King . Donwald then considers regicide at " the setting on of his wife " , who " showed him the means whereby he might soonest accomplish it . " Donwald abhors such an act , but perseveres at the nagging of his wife . After plying the King 's servants with food and drink and letting them fall asleep , the couple admit their confederates to the King 's room , where they then commit the regicide . The murder of Duff has its motivation in revenge , rather than ambition . 
 In Holinshed 's account of King Duncan , the discussion of Lady Macbeth is confined to a single sentence : 
 " The words of the three Weird Sisters also ( of whom before ye have heard ) greatly encouraged him <unk> ; but specially his wife lay sore upon him to attempt the thing , as she was very ambitious , burning with an unquenchable desire to bear the name of a queen . " 
 Not found in Holinshed are the invocation to the " spirits that tend on mortal thoughts , " the sleepwalking scene , and various details found in the drama concerning the death of Macbeth . 
 Although Macbeth 's wife can be traced to a real @-@ world counterpart , Queen Gruoch of Scotland , Shakespeare 's fictional character is tied so weakly to her that the bonds are virtually non @-@ existent . 
 = = Role in the play = = 
 Lady Macbeth makes her first appearance late in scene five of the first act , when she learns in a letter from her husband that three witches have prophesied his future as King . When King Duncan becomes her overnight guest , Lady Macbeth seizes the opportunity to effect his murder . Aware her husband 's temperament is " too full o ' the milk of human kindness " for committing a regicide , she plots the details of the murder ; then , countering her husband 's arguments and reminding him that he first broached the matter , she belittles his courage and manhood , finally winning him to her designs . 
 The King retires after a night of feasting . Lady Macbeth drugs his attendants and lays daggers ready for the commission of the crime . Macbeth kills the sleeping King while Lady Macbeth waits nearby . When he brings the daggers from the King 's room , his Lady orders him to return them to the scene of the crime . He refuses . She carries the daggers to the room and smears the drugged attendants with blood . The couple retire to wash their hands . 
 Following the murder of King Duncan , Lady Macbeth 's role in the plot diminishes . When Duncan 's sons flee the land in fear for their own lives , Macbeth is appointed King . Without consulting his Queen , Macbeth plots other murders in order to secure his throne , and , at a royal banquet , the Queen is forced to dismiss her guests when Macbeth hallucinates . In her last appearance , she sleepwalks in profound torment . She dies off @-@ stage , with suicide being suggested as its cause , when Malcolm declares that she died by " self and violent hands . " 
 In the First Folio , the only source for the play , she is never referred to as " Lady Macbeth " , but variously as " Macbeth 's wife " , " Macbeth 's lady " , or just " lady " . 
 = = <unk> scene = = 
 The sleepwalking scene is one of the most celebrated scenes from Macbeth , and , indeed , in all of Shakespeare . It has no counterpart in Shakespeare 's source material for the play , Holinshed 's Chronicles , but is solely the Bard 's invention . 
 A.C. Bradley notes that , with the exception of the scene 's few closing lines , the scene is entirely in prose with Lady Macbeth being the only major character in Shakespearean tragedy to make a last appearance " denied the dignity of verse . " According to Bradley , Shakespeare generally assigned prose to characters exhibiting abnormal states of mind or abnormal conditions such as <unk> , with the regular rhythm of verse being inappropriate to characters having lost their balance of mind or subject to images or impressions with no rational connection . Lady Macbeth 's recollections – the blood on her hand , the clock striking , her husband 's reluctance – are brought forth from her disordered mind in chance order with each image deepening her anguish . For Bradley , Lady Macbeth 's " brief toneless sentences seem the only voice of truth " with the spare and simple construction of the character 's diction expressing a " <unk> misery . " Lady Macbeth 's compulsive washing of her hands to rid them of blood is reminiscent of hand washing common among sufferers from Obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder .

 = = = Lady Macbeth as anti @-@ mother = = = 
 Stephanie Chamberlain in her article " <unk> " Infanticide : Lady Macbeth and the Murdering Mother in Early Modern England " argues that though Lady Macbeth wants power , her power is “ conditioned on maternity ” , which was a “ conflicted status in early modern England . ” Chamberlain argues that the negative images of Lady Macbeth as a mother figure , such as when she discusses her ability to " bash the brain of the babe that sucks her breast " , reflect controversies concerning the image of motherhood in early modern England . In early modern England , mothers were often accused of hurting the innocent lives that were placed in their hands . Lady Macbeth then personifies all mothers of early modern England who were condemned for Lady Macbeth ’ s fantasy of infanticide . Lady Macbeth ’ s fantasy , Chamberlain argues , is not struggling to be a man , but rather struggling with the condemnation of being a bad mother that was common during that time . 
 Jenijoy La Belle takes a slightly different view in her article , " A Strange <unk> : Lady Macbeth ’ s <unk> . " La Belle states that Lady Macbeth does not wish for just a move away from femininity ; she is asking the spirits to eliminate the basic biological characteristics of womanhood . The main biological characteristic that La Belle focuses on is menstruation . La Belle argues that by asking to be " <unk> [ ed ] " and crying out to spirits to “ make thick [ her ] blood / Stop up th ’ access and passage to remorse , ” Lady Macbeth asks for her menstrual cycle to stop . By having her menstrual cycle stop , Lady Macbeth hopes to stop any feelings of sensitivity and caring that is associated with females . She hopes to become like a man to stop any sense of remorse for the regicide . La Belle furthers her argument by connecting the stopping of the menstrual cycle with the persistent infanticide motifs in the play . La Belle gives examples of " the strangled babe " whose finger is thrown into the witches ’ cauldron ( 4 @.@ 1 @.@ 30 ) ; Macduff ’ s babes who are " savagely slaughter ’ d " ( 4 @.@ 3 @.@ 235 ) ; and the suckling babe with boneless gums whose brains Lady Macbeth would dash out ( 1 @.@ 7 @.@ 57 – 58 ) to argue that Lady Macbeth represents the ultimate anti @-@ mother : not only would she smash in a baby ’ s brains but she would go even further to stop her means of procreation altogether . 
 = = = Lady Macbeth as witch = = = 
 Some literary critics and historians argue that not only does Lady Macbeth represent an anti @-@ mother figure in general , she also embodies a specific type of anti @-@ mother : the witch . Critic Joanna Levin defines a witch as a woman who succumbs to Satanic force , a lust for the devil , and who , either for this reason or the desire to obtain supernatural powers , invokes ( evil ) spirits . English physician Edward Jorden published Briefe Discourse of a Disease Called the Suffocation of the Mother in 1603 , in which he speculated that this force literally derived from the female sexual reproductive organs . Because no one else had published any other studies on the susceptibility of women , especially mothers , to becoming both the witch and the bewitched ( i.e. demonically possessed ) , Jorden 's findings helped create the foundation for the views popularized during the Renaissance about the relationship between women and witchcraft . Levin refers to Marianne Hester 's Lewd Women and Wicked Witches : A Study of Male Domination , in which Hester articulates a feminist interpretation of the witch as an empowered woman . Levin summarises the claim of feminist historians like Hester : the witch should be a figure celebrated for her nonconformity , defiance , and general sense of empowerment ; witches challenged patriarchal authority and hierarchy , specifically " threatening hegemonic sex / gender systems . " This view associates witchcraft — and by extension , Lady Macbeth — not with villainy and evil , but with heroism . 
 Jenijoy La Belle assesses Lady Macbeth 's femininity and sexuality as they relate to motherhood , and <unk> as well . The fact that she conjures spirits likens her to a witch , and the act itself establishes a similarity in the way that both Lady Macbeth and the Weird Sisters from the play " use the metaphoric powers of language to call upon spiritual powers who in turn will influence physical events — in one case the workings of the state , in the other the workings of a woman 's body . " Like the witches , Lady Macbeth strives to make herself an instrument for bringing about the future She proves herself a defiant , empowered nonconformist , and an explicit threat to a patriarchal system of governance in that , through challenging his masculinity , she manipulates Macbeth into murdering King Duncan . Despite the fact that she calls him a coward , Macbeth remains reluctant , until she asks : " What beast wasn 't , then , that made you break this enterprise to me ? / When you durst do it , then you were a man ; / And to be more than what you were , you would / Be so much more the man . " Thus Lady Macbeth enforces a masculine conception of power , yet only after pleading to be <unk> , or <unk> . The Weird Sisters are also depicted as <unk> , androgynous figures . They are bearded ( 1 @.@ 3 @.@ 46 ) , ( which may also be associated with Lady Macbeth 's amenorrhea ) . Witches were perceived as an extreme type of anti @-@ mother , even considered capable of cooking and eating their own children . Although Lady Macbeth may not express violence toward her child with that same degree of grotesqueness , she certainly expresses a sense of brutality when she states that she would smash the babe 's head . 
 = = Performance history = = 
 John Rice , a boy actor with the King 's Men , may have played Lady Macbeth in a performance of what was likely Shakespeare 's tragedy at the Globe Theatre on 20 April 1611 . The performance was witnessed and described by Simon Forman in his manuscript The Book of Plays and Notes thereof per <unk> for Common Policy . His account , however , does not establish whether the play was Shakespeare 's Macbeth or a work on the same subject by another dramatist . The role may have been beyond the talents of a boy actor and may have been played by a man in early performances . 
 In the mid @-@ 18th century , Hannah Pritchard played Lady Macbeth opposite David Garrick 's Macbeth . She was , in Thomas Davies ' words , " insensible to compunction and inflexibly bent on cruelty . " 
 Sarah Siddons starred in John Philip Kemble 's 1794 production at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane and offered a psychologically intricate portrait of Lady Macbeth in the tradition of Hannah Pritchard . Siddons was especially praised for moving audiences in the sleepwalking scene with her depiction of a soul in profound torment . Siddons and Kemble furthered the view established by Pritchard and Garrick that character was the essence of Shakespearean drama . 
 William Hazlitt commented on Siddons ' performance : 
 In speaking of the character of Lady Macbeth , we ought not to pass over Mrs. Siddons 's manner of acting that part . We can conceive of nothing grander . It was something above nature . It seemed almost as if a being of a superior order had dropped from a higher sphere to awe the world with the majesty of her appearance . Power was seated on her brow , passion emanated from her breast as from a shrine ; she was tragedy personified . In coming on in the sleeping @-@ scene , her eyes were open , but their sense was shut . She was like a person bewildered and unconscious of what she did . Her lips moved involuntarily — all her gestures were involuntary and mechanical . She glided on and off the stage like an apparition . To have seen her in that character was an event in every one 's life , not to be forgotten . 
 Helen Faucit was critiqued by Henry Morley , a professor of English literature in University College , London , who thought the actress " too demonstrative and noisy " in the scenes before Duncan 's murder with the " Come , you spirits " speech " simply spouted " and its closing " Hold ! Hold ! " shouted in a " most <unk> manner . " In the " I have given suck " speech , he thought Faucit " poured out " the speech in a way that recalled the " scold at the door of a gin @-@ shop . " Faucit , he believed , was " too essentially feminine , too exclusively gifted with the art of expressing all that is most beautiful and graceful in womanhood , to succeed in inspiring anything like awe and terror . " He thought her talents more congenial to the second phase of the character , and found her " admirably good " in the banquet scene . Her sleepwalking scene , however , was described as having " the air of a too well @-@ studied dramatic recitation . " 
 In 1884 at the Gaiety Theatre , Sarah Bernhardt performed the sleepwalking scene barefoot and clad in a clinging nightdress , and , in 1888 , a critic noted Ellen Terry was " the stormy dominant woman of the eleventh century equipped with the capricious emotional <unk> of the nineteenth century . " 
 In 1915 and 1918 , Sybil Thorndike played the role at Old Vic and then at the Prince 's Theatre in 1926 . Flora Robson played the role in Tyrone Guthrie 's Old Vic production in 1934 . In 1955 , Vivien Leigh played Lady Macbeth opposite Laurence Olivier at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon . In 1977 at The Other Place in Stratford , Judi Dench and Ian McKellen played the infamous husband and wife in Trevor Nunn 's production . Other notable Lady Macbeths in the late 20th century included Judith Anderson , Pamela Brown , Diana Wynyard , Simone Signoret , Vivien Merchant , Jane <unk> , Helen Mirren and Janet <unk> . 
 Jeanette Nolan performed the role in Orson Welles ' 1948 film adaptation and was critiqued by Bosley Crowther in the New York Times of 28 December 1950 : " The Lady Macbeth of Jeanette Nolan is a pop @-@ eyed and haggard dame whose driving determination is as vagrant as the highlights on her face . Likewise , her influence upon Macbeth , while fleetingly suggested in a few taut lines and etched in a couple of hot embraces , is not developed adequately . The passion and torment of the conflict between these two which resides in the play has been rather seriously neglected in this truncated rendering .

 In 2009 , Pegasus Books published The Tragedy of Macbeth Part II , a play by American author and playwright Noah Lukeman which endeavoured to offer a sequel to Macbeth and to resolve its many loose ends , particularly Lady Macbeth ’ s reference to her having had a child ( which , historically , she did - from a previous marriage , having remarried Macbeth after being widowed . ) Written in blank verse , the play was published to critical acclaim . 
 Alex Kingston starred as Lady Macbeth opposite Kenneth Branagh in his and Rob Ashford 's adaption of Macbeth . The play was first performed at the Manchester Festival in 2013 and then transferred to New York for a limited engagement in 2014 . 
 Marion Cotillard played the character in Justin <unk> 's 2015 film adaptation opposite Michael Fassbender .

 = Invasion of Ceylon ( 1795 ) = 
 The Invasion of Ceylon was a military campaign fought as a series of amphibious operations between the summer of 1795 and spring of 1796 between the garrison of the Batavian colonies on the Indian Ocean island of Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) and a British invasion force sent from British India . The Dutch Republic had been a British ally during the French Revolutionary Wars , but was overrun by the French Republic in the winter of 1794 and reformed into the client state of the Batavian Republic . The British government , working with the exiled Stadtholder William of Orange , ordered the seizure of Batavian assets including colonies of the former Dutch Empire . Among the first territories to be attacked were those on the coast of the island of Ceylon , with operations initially focused on the trading port at Trincomalee . 
 To achieve the seizure of the colony , the British government instructed Lord Hobart , Governor of Madras to use the forces at his disposal to invade and capture the Batavian held parts of the island . Prosecution of the campaign was given to Colonel James Stuart , supported by naval forces under Rear @-@ Admiral Peter Rainier . Stuart called on Batavian governor Johan Van Angelbeek to surrender the colony peacefully and many trading posts were taken without resistance , but Stuart 's forces were opposed at Trincomalee in August 1795 and briefly at Colombo in February 1796 . Following short sieges British forces were able to secure control of the Dutch colony , and Ceylon would remain a part of the British Empire for the next 153 years . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1793 , the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic went to war with the French Republic , joining the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars . Despite resistance from the Dutch Army and a British expeditionary force , the Dutch Republic was overrun by the French in the winter of 1794 – 1795 , the French reforming the country into the Batavian Republic , a client state of the French regime . Although war between Britain and the Batavian Republic had not been declared , the British government sent instructions on 19 January for Batavian shipping to be seized and , in conjunction with Stadtholder William of Orange , living in exile in London , for Batavian colonies to be neutralised in order to deny their use to the French . On 9 February these orders culminated in the outbreak of war between Britain and the Batavian Republic . 
 News of the conflict took some months to reach the East Indies , where British and French naval forces had fought an inconclusive campaign for control of the Indian Ocean trade routes since 1793 . British forces , supporting those of the East India Company , were principally operating from Madras and Calcutta in India , the French from their island bases of Île de France ( now Mauritius ) and Réunion . Following an inconclusive engagement off Île Ronde on 22 October 1794 , the French squadron on Île de France had remained under blockade at Port Louis and thus most of the British naval forces in the East Indies were available for the campaign against the Batavian territories . Dutch colonisation of Ceylon did not span the whole island , which was mostly ruled by the interior Kingdom of Kandy . European settlement was instead concentrated at coastal strips surrounding the significant ports of Colombo on the west coast and Trincomalee on the east , supplemented by smaller trading factories and settlements elsewhere . Trincomalee was particularly important as raiding forces based in the port could easily strike against British trade routes in the Bay of Bengal , but the port had limited food supplies , poorly @-@ developed facilities and a small garrison . 
 = = Planning = = 
 Upon receiving the news of the hostilities between Britain and the Batavian Republic , Lord Hobart , Governor of Madras , conferred with Rainier and ordered the invasion of Ceylon . Command of land forces was given to Colonel James Stuart , whose forces consisted of the 71st , 72nd and 73rd Regiments of Foot , 1st and 23rd battalions Madras Native Infantry and detachments from the Royal Artillery and Madras Artillery and auxiliary forces , totaling 2 @,@ 700 men . This force was supported by a Royal Navy force led by Rainier in the 74 @-@ gun ship of the line HMS Suffolk and the 50 @-@ gun fourth rate ship HMS Centurion , which sailed from Madras on 21 July . Suffolk escorted a large convoy of East India Company merchant ships transporting troops and supplies , augmented off <unk> by additional reinforcements protected by the frigates HMS Diomede and HMS Heroine . 
 It was hoped by Stuart and Rainer that the Batavian governor Johan Van Angelbeek might be persuaded to allow a peaceful occupation of Ceylon by British forces , especially in light of the Kew Letters from William of Orange , which advocated cooperation with British forces . A Major Agnew was sent ashore at Colombo to negotiate and his attempts to persuade Van Angelbeek to allow 300 British troops to land at Fort <unk> , which overlooked Trincomalee , were successful . On arrival off the port on the eastern coast of Ceylon on 1 August however the commander of the defences refused to acknowledge the instruction , citing problems with the wording of the instructions . For two days attempts were made to convince the Batavian commander , the British position partially undermined by the destruction of Diomede in Trincomalee harbour after striking an uncharted rock . Although all of the crew and passengers were saved , large quantities of military stores sank with the frigate . 
 = = Siege of Trincomalee = = 
 On 3 August , with negotiations fruitless , Rainier and Stuart ordered the invasion to go ahead . The troops landed 4 nautical miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) north of <unk> unopposed and advanced slowly though the sandy terrain . Due to heavy surf and high winds the disembarkation was not completed until 13 August , and the first emplacements approaching Trincomalee were not begun until 18 August . Throughout this period the Batavian garrison made no effort to oppose or impede the advance British forces . After five days the British forces had emplaced eight 18 @-@ pounder long guns and a number of smaller cannon , some borrowed from Suffolk in firing positions , opening a heavy <unk> which by the following day had created a sizeable breach in the walls of Trincomalee . Preparations were made for an assault and messages sent to the fort 's commander demanding his surrender . 
 After some negotiation followed by a brief resumption of the bombardment , the Batavian commander surrendered . The garrison of 679 troops were taken prisoner and more than 100 cannon seized by the British . British losses in the brief campaign amounted to 16 killed and 60 wounded . Following the fall of Trincomalee , nearby Fort <unk> was summoned to surrender on 27 August . Four days later the commander turned his position over to the British under the same terms offered to the garrison of Trincomalee . With resistance broken , Batavian trading posts along the Ceylon coastline surrendered in quick succession , Batticaloa to the 22nd Regiment of Foot on 18 September , Jaffna to Stuart directly on 27 September after a landing in force , <unk> to a detachment of troops from 52nd Regiment of Foot in HMS Hobart on 1 October and the island of Mannar on 5 October . 
 = = Fall of Colombo = = 
 In September 1795 , Rainier took most of his squadron eastwards to operate against Batavia , leaving Captain Alan Hyde Gardner in command of the blockade of Colombo , the last remaining Batavian territory on the island . In January 1796 , command of the East Indies was assumed by Sir George Keith Elphinstone , who ordered ships of the line HMS Stately and HMS Arrogant to assist Gardner . 
 In February 1796 a final expedition was prepared against Ceylon , with instructions to seize Colombo and the surrounding area . Stuart again took command , supported by Gardner in Heroine and the sloops HMS Rattlesnake , HMS Echo and HMS Swift , as well as five EIC ships . Stuart 's force disembarked at Negombo , a Dutch fort abandoned the previous year , on 5 February and marched overland to Colombo , arriving without opposition on 14 February . The garrison was issued with a demand requiring their surrender or to expect an immediate assault , and storming parties were prepared , but on 15 February Van Angelbeek agreed to capitulate and Stuart took possession of the city peacefully . 
 The value of the captured goods from Colombo alone amounted to more than £ 300 @,@ 000 . More importantly for the British , Ceylon was not one of the colonies returned to the Batavian Republic following the Treaty of Amiens which brought the war to a brief close in 1802 . Britain retained Ceylon as part of the British Empire until independence was granted in 1948 .

 During a scriptwriting workshop held by Mira Nair in 2005 , Cajetan Boy , a Kenyan writer from Nairobi , showed Vishal Bhardwaj a script about twin brothers from the city 's slums and the events that occur in their lives during a 24 @-@ hour period . Bhardwaj liked Boy 's approach to the script ; Nair and Bhardwaj discussed it and thought it was a typical Bollywood masala film . Boy sent Bhardwaj another draft of his script . Three years later , Bhardwaj asked Boy to sell him the idea , and he later bought the script for US $ 4 @,@ 000 . Bhardwaj revisited the idea and added some Bollywood elements and a dark , serious side to the script . He worked on the original idea with writers Sabrina Dhawan , Abhishek Chaubey and <unk> Sen. He included Dhawan in writing the screenplay because as he thought she would give it a " solid structure " . Bhardwaj said that during the writing of the screenplay , most of the original ideas were changed and the climax was " Indianized " . His re @-@ worked version now included one brother with a stammer and the other with a lisp . Bhardwaj said that despite the complicated structure , Kaminey is " anything but arty " and could not alienate audiences in any part of India , and that it is a simple story but with a complicated structure . Dhawan said that the film 's script was complex and has multiple stories which required excessive writing and rewriting to make each character sound distinct . 
 The media showed concern over the film 's title , deeming it " odd " , and some people were shocked because of the title , which can be translated into English as " mean " . However , the makers said that " <unk> " is not a negative term and is actually a term of endearment . According to Bhardwaj , the idea for the title came from a scene from Gulzar 's <unk> ( 1987 ) , in which the lead actor ( Naseeruddin Shah ) refers to the actress in a loving manner ; it was the first time that he heard the word used that way . Bhardwaj told Rediff , " when the script of this film was written , it was like discovering your own mean side . The format of the film is of a caper and all the characters in this film , excluding one , has an agenda . So I thought it was an apt title for the film " . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Shahid Kapoor was cast in the film 's lead role . Several media outlets reported that Bhardwaj considered many actors before casting Kapoor in the role , which he refused . Bhardwaj refuted the claims , saying , " There is a huge difference between discussing and narrating and offering someone a film and I would like to clear up the rumour by saying that Kaminey was never offered to anyone else and so no one rejected it . " Kapoor said that he accepted the role after reading the script . Priyanka Chopra was cast to play Sweety , the lead female role . She initially turned down the role , saying she felt it was a boys ' film and her eight @-@ scene part did not seem good enough . However , Bhardwaj persuaded her to accept the role . The idea for casting the screenwriter Amol Gupte came from the casting director Honey <unk> . Gupte said that when he received a call from <unk> , he thought it was a joke . He stated , " A man named Honey introduced himself as Vishal Bhardwaj 's casting director and offered me a very important role . I banged the phone down not believing a word of what he said " . However , after meeting <unk> and hearing a script reading , he loved the story and accepted the offer . The actors Chandan Roy Sanyal , Shiv <unk> , Hrishikesh Joshi , <unk> Dutta and Deb Mukherjee were cast in supporting roles . For the role of drug dealer Tashi , Bhardwaj chose his friend Tenzing Nima — a tour operator in Mussoorie — saying he had the character and attitude he wanted , and a weird sense of humour . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 Bhardwaj instructed the film 's entire cast and crew to watch caper classics such as Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ( 1998 ) , Snatch ( 2000 ) , Pulp Fiction ( 1994 ) and True Romance ( 1993 ) to study the nuances and become familiar with the genre . Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu , twin brothers with speech impediments ; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers . The producers did not want them to look like caricatures , so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments . According to Kapoor , the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects . They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping . Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges . Charlie 's physique was very different from Kapoor 's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body . He found changing from one character to the other difficult . 
 Chopra described her character Sweety as " feisty and vivacious " . She said , " Sweety is very busy , and does not have time to take care of her looks and apply make up . Her only aim in life is to bunk her lectures and visit her boyfriend 's college or stay in his hotel , and eventually marry him . " Chopra described both her character and herself as being " outspoken and fun loving " as well as honest and unable to " hide something that is wrong " . She said she had a different cultural background to Sweety , and found it challenging to convincingly portray a Maharashtrian Marathi girl . She had to adopt body language and a Maharashtrian accent to suit the character . She learnt the Marathi language to make the character as authentic as possible , which she found difficult as a Punjabi . Chopra said : " I am speaking a lot of Marathi in the film . It was difficult for me because it 's a difficult language and I am not good at Marathi . But I think it 's my luck that through Kaminey I got to learn one more language . " 
 Gupte described his character as mercurial , and found playing him a physical delight . Gupte said his character keeps the frame unpredictable and that it provided him with a foil to express rage and anguish . He worked a lot on his characterisation and tried to bring in his own references from European and Japanese cinema . Chandan Roy Sanyal described his character Mikhail as provocative , mad , wicked and humorous . <unk> and Joshi , who played Lobo and Lele respectively , described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti @-@ Narcotics Bureau . They said that to prepare for the roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj 's instructions to get the characters right . Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb by reading the script and understanding the characters , and discussing it with Bhardwaj . Dutta , who played <unk> — a Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealing — said that he did not have much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai , where Bhardwaj briefed him . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography commenced in mid @-@ 2008 , and the film was mostly shot in Mumbai . During a late night shoot for a scene in Pune , Chopra received minor injuries . Chopra was supposed to ride a motorcycle with Kapoor seated on the pillion seat . Both fell off the motorcycle as it skidded on mud . Kapoor was unhurt but Chopra received scratch marks and bruises . It was reported that Kapoor suffered from several injuries while shooting . During filming , Chopra became hoarse because she had to scream her lines ; an essential part of her role as an " extremely vocal Maharashtrian girl . " Some important railway sequences were shot at Wadi Bunder Yard near Sandhurst Road . Kapoor found filming for both of his characters at nearly the same time very difficult ; he would shoot them on alternate days . 
 = = Themes and influences = = 
 According to the Hindustan Times , Kaminey " is the first attempt to deal with reality in a mature , matter of fact manner . " Unlike other Hindi films , in which the female lead is Sita , the protagonist is Rama and the antagonist is Ravana , the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in " layered and complex " situations . Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj 's " enduring fascination for underdogs , characters on the margins of society and the morally compromised " . Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with " themes that affect our lives directly " , and " is a reminder that we all have a dark side , and often we are not fully aware of that side " . Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote , " Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects . In today 's world of logorrhea , communication is fraught with many dangers : misunderstandings , paranoias , recriminations , conflicts . Everyone speaks but no one understands . Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out . " He continued , " [ w ] ith some glitches , Bhardwaj has almost re @-@ birthed the Hindi film " . The film also explores sex and sexuality , which according to Bedi were explored in a " radically different and refreshing " way , and the director " daringly takes it a step further " . When Sweety becomes pregnant , the couple " decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation . So she literally pushes her man into marriage . ( Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage , it would have been a complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film . ) " The Daily Beast said that " for aficionados of the Hindi @-@ language genre , Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto . It takes classic Bollywood tropes — estranged brothers , a case of mistaken identity , high drama approaching slapstick comedy — and presents them with Hollywood @-@ style realism instead of Bollywood 's wink @-@ nudge mix of melodrama and posturing . 
 Bhardwaj has been influenced by many directors — including Manmohan Desai , Subhash Ghai , Quentin Tarantino and Francis Ford Coppola — and combines these influences in his work . Rakesh Bedi wrote that " Bhardwaj keeps displaying his vision throughout the film " . Reviewers have compared the film 's multi @-@ plot narrative to those of several films by Tarantino , Guy Ritchie and the Coen Brothers . Reviewers said that the film mostly belongs to the level of Pulp Fiction ; Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called it " Bollywood 's first all @-@ the @-@ way @-@ out @-@ to @-@ there pulp fiction " . Bedi wrote , " there 's Buñuel in the Bengali dons , there 's Kurosawa ... in that surreal train car in which Charlie lives , there 's Ray in money @-@ floating dreams that Charlie has " . Keshav <unk> of the Hindustan Times compared the apocalyptical gang war in the climax to Apocalypse Now ( 1979 ) . He said , " Bhardwaj just demolishes the cliches of Bollywood . In ripping apart the stereotype , he gives us a prototype : a Bollywood that deals with alienation , ... angst , ... and atrocity . " A review in The Times of India said that the film 's climax reaches the level of Reservoir Dogs , and described it as " absolutely riveting stuff , with the camera going on a hitherto unexplored journey in Indian cinema . " 
 = = Soundtrack = = 
 Vishal Bhardwaj composed the music soundtrack for Kaminey and Gulzar wrote the lyrics . The album contains five original songs , two remixes and one theme song ; it was released on 6 July 2009 . Vishal Bhardwaj stated that the song " Dhan Te Nan " was not originally composed for the film , but for an episode of the television series Gubbare titled Dhan Te Nan . The soundtrack album was commercially successful after its release , especially " Dhan Te Nan " , which topped the charts across various platforms . 
 The soundtrack album received positive reviews from music critics . Rediff.com rated the album 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 , labelled it a " masterpiece " and wrote , " Bhardwaj has delivered a soundtrack that is lethally explosive . Not that we expected anything less . And trust Gulzar to artfully craft a really long fuse for the Kaminey bomb , making sure the tracks stay afire long before and after they actually go boom . " Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave a rating 4 out 5 and wrote , " Kaminey is certainly not a run of the mill album and this is where its prime strength lies . The album boasts of at least three <unk> tracks — ' Dhan Te Nan ' ( sure shot superhit ) , ' Thode <unk> ' ( must for the hearts in love ) and ' Raat Ke Dhai <unk> ' ( for some ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> ' ) . Songs like ' <unk> ' and ' Kaminey ' are innovative and situational which showcase the range of Vishal Bhardwaj . Add to that the ' Go Charlie Go – Theme Music ' and you know that Kaminey is yet another addition to some excellent albums that have hit the stands during last one month . " Planet Bollywood rated the album 8 @.@ 5 out of 10 and said it is the best soundtrack released that year , and that " [ i ] t has experimentations with both music and lyrics " . Indo @-@ Asian News Service praised the soundtrack and said that " ... " Kaminey " is easily among 2009 's finest scores . Experimental in its sound , yet very mainstream in appeal .

 = = Marketing and release = = 
 The teaser poster of Kaminey was received positively by critics . The trailer , which introduces four characters ; one lisping , one stuttering , a woman yelling about having raped a man and one jeering at the <unk> , received positive reviews . Critics kept their expectations high due to Bhardwaj 's previous films , and said the trailer was like a comic book which introduces the characters of Kapoor and Chopra differently . The theatrical trailers and the music generated interest for the film . The film 's marketing also involved public appearances by Chopra and Kapoor . 
 The makers of the film were disappointed by the Censor Board for Film Certification 's decision to grant the film an " A " certificate — meant for viewers 18 years or older — instead of a " U / A " certificate that they had expected . Bhardwaj said , " It was injustice to us . There is no abusive language used in the film and the violence is of ' comic book kind ' . " The Censor Board asked him to replace dialogue which mentioned the city of <unk> — which they said was a sensitive constituency — with a fictitious city name . He replaced <unk> with Barabanki . " The film was subject to some controversies . A First Information Report was filed by Jagannath Sena <unk> at a police station in Puri against the film for allegedly denigrating Lord Jagannath . According to them , a scene in which the text " Apna Hath Jagannath " is seen in a toilet on a semi @-@ clad model had hurt religious sentiments . The objectionable portion of the scene was removed from the prints released in the state of Orissa . A complaint supported by a caste group backed by a Samajwadi Party MP about the use of the name of a community " <unk> " in the song " Dhan Te Nan " — which was considered derogatory to the <unk> community — was filed with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting . The Censor Board reacted to the complaint , insisting on the replacement of the word , which was later replaced with " Dilli " . 
 Kaminey was scheduled to release on 5 June 2009 . However , the release was postponed because of problems between the producers and multiplexes in India . The film was released on 14 August 2009 on 1 @,@ 200 screens worldwide . Because of the 2009 flu pandemic , the film was not released in the Maharashtra region — including Mumbai and Pune — because the multiplexes in these cities were closed by the Maharashtra government for three days as part of precautionary measures against swine flu . Moser Baer Home Videos released Kaminey on DVD in October 2009 across all regions in a two @-@ disc pack complying with the NTSC format . One disc contains the film ; the other has additional content including a " making of the film " documentary , the original beginning and deleted scenes .
