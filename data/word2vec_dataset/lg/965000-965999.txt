 = Act of Independence of Lithuania = 
 The Act of <unk> Independence of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuvos Valstybės <unk> <unk> ) or Act of February 16 was signed by the Council of Lithuania on February 16 , 1918 , proclaiming the restoration of an independent State of Lithuania , governed by democratic principles , with Vilnius as its capital . The Act was signed by all twenty representatives of the Council , which was chaired by Jonas Basanavičius . The Act of February 16 was the result of a series of resolutions on the issue , including one issued by the Vilnius Conference and the Act of January 8 . The path to the Act was long and complex because the German Empire exerted pressure on the Council to form an alliance . The Council had to carefully maneuver between the Germans , whose troops were present in Lithuania , and the demands of the Lithuanian people . 
 The immediate effects of the announcement of Lithuania 's re @-@ establishment of independence were limited . Publication of the Act was prohibited by the German authorities , and the text was distributed and printed illegally . The work of the Council was hindered , and Germans remained in control over Lithuania . The situation changed only when Germany lost World War I in the fall of 1918 . In November 1918 the first Cabinet of Lithuania was formed , and the Council of Lithuania gained control over the territory of Lithuania . Independent Lithuania , although it would soon be battling the Wars of Independence , became a reality . 
 While the Act 's original document has been lost , its legacy continues . The laconic Act is the legal basis for the existence of modern Lithuania , both during the interwar period and since 1990 . The Act formulated the basic constitutional principles that were and still are followed by all Constitutions of Lithuania . The Act itself was a key element in the foundation of Lithuania 's re @-@ establishment of independence in 1990 . Lithuania , breaking away from the Soviet Union , stressed that it was simply re @-@ establishing the independent state that existed between the world wars and that the Act never lost its legal power . 
 = = Historic background and Council of Lithuania = = 
 Lithuania had a centuries long tradition of statehood following the coronation of Mindaugas the King of Lithuania . 
 After the last Partition of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795 , Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire . During the 19th century , both the Lithuanians and the Poles attempted to restore their independence . Lithuanians rebelled during the 1830 November Uprising and the 1863 January Uprising , but their first real opportunity arose when both Russia and Germany were weakened during World War I. 
 In 1915 , Germany occupied western parts of the Russian Empire . After the Russian Revolution in 1917 , Germany conceived the geopolitical strategy of Mitteleuropa – a regional network of puppet states that would serve as a buffer zone – and agreed to allow the Vilnius Conference , hoping that it would proclaim that the Lithuanian nation wanted to detach itself from Russia and establish a closer relationship with Germany . However , this strategy backfired ; the conference , held from September 18 – 22 of 1917 , adopted a resolution that an independent Lithuania should be established and that a closer relationship with Germany would be conditional on Germany 's formal recognition of the new state . On September 21 , the 214 attendees at the conference elected a 20 @-@ member Council of Lithuania to codify this resolution . The German authorities did not allow that resolution to be published , but they did permit the Council to proceed . The Vilnius Conference also resolved that a constituent assembly be elected " in conformity with democratic principles by all the inhabitants of Lithuania " .

 = = = Act of December 11 = = = 
 The Act of December 11 was the second stage in the progression towards the final Act of Independence . The first draft , demanded by chancellor Georg von Hertling , was prepared by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 1 . Further changes were jointly prepared by the German chancellery and by a delegation of the Council of Lithuania . The delegation 's members were Antanas Smetona , Steponas Kairys , Vladas Mironas , Jurgis Šaulys , Petras Klimas and Aleksandras Stulginskis . After discussion amongst the parties , a compromise was reached on the document 's text . The German representative , Kurt von <unk> , insisted that not one word be changed in the agreed @-@ upon text and that all the Council members sign the document . 
 After the delegation returned to Vilnius , a session of the Council was held on December 11 in order to discuss the Act . It was adopted without any further changes . Fifteen voted in favor of the Act , three voted against it , one member abstained , and one did not participate . It is not entirely clear whether every member of the Council signed this document . The Act was written in German , and apparently no official Lithuanian translation was prepared . Therefore , different sources provide slightly different translations . The Act of December 11 pronounced Lithuania 's independence , but also asked German government for protection ( clause 2 ) and called for " a firm and permanent alliance " with Germany . Since the Act specified that the alliance was to be formed based on conventions concerning military affairs , transportation , customs , and currency , many Lithuanians argued that the Council had overstepped its authority : the September resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference clearly demanded that a constituent assembly decide these crucial matters of state . 
 = = = Act of January 8 = = = 
 When peace talks started between Germany and Russia in 1918 , German authorities asked the Lithuanian representatives to prepare two notifications of independence — one for Russia , in which Lithuania 's ties with Russia would be denounced and nothing would be mentioned about an alliance with Germany , and a version to be released in Germany that would essentially repeat the Act of December 11 . The Council decided to amend the first part of the Act of December 11 . Petras Klimas included a sentence calling for the Constituent Assembly . Another important development was the statement that democratic principles would be the basis of the new state 's governance , something that was declared by the Vilnius Conference , but omitted in the Act of December 11 . The second part , mentioning the " firm and permanent alliance with Germany " , was completely omitted . Its final version was approved on January 8 , 1918 , the day that U.S. President Woodrow Wilson announced his Fourteen Points . In its essence , the Act of January 8 did not differ from the Act of February 16 . 
 However , Ober Ost , the German military administration , rejected the changes . On January 26 , in compliance with the earlier request , the two versions of the notification were approved , but they did not include the changes of January 8 . The texts were prepared based on the Act of December 11 . These concessions to the Germans created tensions among the council members . Four members – Mykolas Biržiška , Steponas Kairys , Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis – resigned from the Council in protest . Chairman Antanas Smetona , who supported the Act of December 11 , stepped down . Jonas Basanavičius , who would later be called the patriarch of independence , was elected chairman . 
 = = = Act of February 16 = = = 
 Germany failed to recognize Lithuania as an independent state , and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the Brest @-@ Litovsk negotiations that started on December 22 , 1917 between the Central Powers and Russia in order to settle territorial claims . During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities , it was made clear that the Council would serve only as an advisory board . This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries . The prime concern at this point was to invite back those members who had left the Council . Negotiations were undertaken that led to the reformulation of previous versions of the Act . 
 The four withdrawn members demanded that the Council return to the Act of January 8 and omit the mention of any alliance with Germany . After heated debates that lasted for several weeks , on February 15 , at 10 o 'clock am , the new revision of the Act was ready . It included , with minor stylistic changes , wording of the Act of January 8 and promulgation and notification , drafted on February 1 . Promulgation and notification do not carry legal weight and do not change the meaning of a legal document . The Council , including the withdrawn members , was invited to return the next day for its finalization . On the next day , February 16 , 1918 , at 12 : 30 pm , all twenty Council members met in the room of Lithuanian Committee for Support of the War Victims , at 30 <unk> Street in Vilnius . The building has since been known as the House of the Signatories ( Lithuanian : <unk> <unk> ) and houses a museum . The Council first voted to approve the first part , the first two paragraphs up to the word <unk> , of the Act . This section was approved unanimously . The second part , however , did not receive support from the four withdrawn members because they were not satisfied with the word " finally " in describing the duties of the Constituent Assembly ( in " ... the foundation of the Lithuanian State and its relations with other countries will be finally determined by the Constituent Assembly ... " ) . They were afraid that this word would give a pretext for the Council to usurp the powers of the Constituent Assembly , while the majority argued that the word simply expressed the non @-@ negotiable and non @-@ <unk> nature of the future Assembly 's decisions . Therefore , the Act was unanimously approved en bloc but did not have full @-@ fledged support from all twenty men .

 Soon after the signing , the Act was taken to Germany and handed to parties in the Reichstag . On February 18 , the text was reprinted in German newspapers , including Das Neue <unk> , Vossische Zeitung , <unk> Rundschau and <unk> . In Lithuania a text of the proclamation was prepared for printing in newspapers , particularly in Lietuvos <unk> , the Council 's newspaper established by Antanas Smetona ; but the German authorities prohibited this publication . Although the majority of the copies of the issue were confiscated , the newspaper 's editor , Petras Klimas , managed to hide about 60 of them . 
 On March 3 , 1918 , Germany and the now @-@ Bolshevik Russia signed the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk . It declared that the Baltic nations were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them . On March 23 , Germany recognized independent Lithuania on the basis of the December 11 declaration . However , in substance , nothing had changed either in Lithuania or in the Council 's status : any efforts to establish an administration were hindered . This situation changed when the German Revolution started and Germany lost the war in the fall of 1918 – it was no longer in a position to dictate terms . The Council of Lithuania adopted the first provisional constitution on November 2 . The functions of government were entrusted to a three @-@ member presidium , and Augustinas Voldemaras was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers of Lithuania . Complete international recognition took several years ; the US affirmed it on July 28 , 1922 .

 Two copies of the Act were signed : the original and a duplicate . The original was given to Jonas Basanavičius to safeguard and protect . The original was never published or used in any public matters ; its existence was first mentioned in the press in 1933 . The whereabouts of the original remain unknown . The duplicate was used in day @-@ to @-@ day business , and was stored in the president 's archives until June 15 , 1940 , the day when Lithuania received an ultimatum from the Soviet Union and lost its independence . After that date the document disappeared . Neither the original nor the duplicate has been located ; historians and adventurers continue to hunt for it . In 2006 , a team of engineers searched the walls of the former house of Petras Vileišis . Two facsimiles of the duplicate were produced , one in 1928 and the other in 1933 . The 1928 facsimile is a closer reproduction of the Act in its original state ; there are spelling errors , and the background is visually " noisy " , while the 1933 facsimile shows the Act in an " improved " condition .

 Most of the signatories of the Act remained active in the cultural and political life of independent Lithuania . Jonas Vileišis served in the Seimas and as mayor of Kaunas , temporary capital of Lithuania ; <unk> <unk> was involved in finance , opening several banks . Among the signatories were two future Presidents of Lithuania , Antanas Smetona and Aleksandras Stulginskis . Jonas Basanavičius , chairman of the Council of Lithuania , returned to an academic life , pursuing his research in Lithuanian culture and folklore . Five signatories died before World War II started ; three died during the Nazi occupation . Those who did not emigrate to Western countries became political prisoners after Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union . 
 Aleksandras Stulginskis and Petras Klimas were sent to prison in Siberia by Soviet authorities , but survived and returned to Lithuania ; Pranas <unk> and Vladas Mironas were also sent to Siberia but died there . Kazys Bizauskas disappeared during the summer of 1941 while being transported to a Soviet prison in Minsk ; he is presumed to have been shot along with a number of other prisoners . Donatas <unk> was deported to Russia on June 14 , 1941 . 
 Several of the surviving signatories emigrated . Jurgis Šaulys and <unk> Steponas Šaulys died in Switzerland . Antanas Smetona , Mykolas Biržiška , and Steponas Kairys emigrated to the United States and are buried there . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Act of February 16 proclaimed the re @-@ establishment ( <unk> ) of the Lithuanian state , making it the successor to the Lithuanian historical state , the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . In this respect the Council deviated from the resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference which called for establishment ( <unk> ) of a Lithuanian state . However , it was made clear that the new state would be quite different from the old Duchy : it was to be organized only in ethnic Lithuanian lands ( except for <unk> region which was majority Polish ) and was to be governed by democratic principles , as opposed to the multi @-@ ethnic Duchy that had been ruled by aristocracy . The termination of the ties binding Lithuania to other states was addressed to Germany , Russia , and Poland , all of which had their own plans for the country . Even though not addressed directly , the Act renounced any attempt to resurrect the former Polish @-@ Lithuanian union . 
 The Act of February 16 , 1918 , is the legal basis for the existence of present @-@ day Lithuania , both during the interwar period and since 1990 . The Act became one of the key elements during the restoration of Lithuania 's independence from the Soviet Union in 1990 . A paragraph in the Act of the Re @-@ Establishment of the State of Lithuania , delivered on March 11 , 1990 , stated : 
 This formulation emphasized the continuity of the two legal Acts . The Act of February 16 , 1918 and its successor , the Act of March 11 , 1990 , are regarded as two of the most important developments of Lithuanian society in the 20th century . 
 February 16 in Lithuania is now an official holiday . On this day various ceremonies are hosted all across Lithuania . The 2014 commemoration included laying flowers at the signatories ’ graves in Rasos Cemetery , awarding the Lithuanian National Prize , the hoisting of the three Baltic States ’ s flags at <unk> Square , dedicated concerts at Cathedral Square in Vilnius and at the Lithuanian National Philharmonic Society hall , and the lighting of 16 fires along Gediminas Avenue . 
 In 1992 , an award was established in honor of Jonas Basanavičius , who led the Council of Lithuania when the Act of February 16 was signed . The Jonas Basanavičius Prize is bestowed for distinguished work within the previous five years in the fields of ethnic and cultural studies . 
 = 2007 National League Wild Card tie @-@ breaker game = 
 The 2007 National League wild @-@ card tie @-@ breaker game was a one @-@ game extension to Major League Baseball 's ( MLB ) 2007 regular season , played between the San Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies of the National League 's ( NL ) West Division to determine the NL wild card . It was played at Coors Field in Denver , Colorado , on October 1 , 2007 . The Rockies won the game 9 – 8 in thirteen innings on a controversial play at home plate . 
 The game was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win – loss records of 89 – 73 . The Rockies won a coin flip late in the season , which awarded them home field for the game . Upon winning , the Rockies advanced to the NL Division Series where they swept the Philadelphia Phillies . After advancing , they swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NL Championship Series , winning their first pennant in franchise history . However , the Rockies were , in turn , swept in the 2007 World Series by the Boston Red Sox , ending their season . In baseball statistics the tie @-@ breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams , with all events in the game added to regular season statistics . 
 = = Background = = 
 The 2007 season saw heavy competition between the Padres and the Arizona Diamondbacks for the National League West divisional title . The Padres spent 52 days with at least a share of the lead , while the Diamondbacks spent 89 total days atop the division and ultimately won by a game with a record of 90 – 72 . The Rockies spent just three days , last on April 6 , with a lead in the division . Notably the Diamondbacks scored 20 fewer runs than their pitchers allowed , one of just five teams in MLB history to make the playoffs despite being outscored during the season . 
 In addition to the divisional race , the competition over the wild card continued to the last day of the season . Six teams in the 2007 National League finished within five games of one another : the aforementioned Diamondbacks , Padres , and Rockies along with the Philadelphia Phillies , New York Mets , and Chicago Cubs . The Diamondbacks , Phillies , and Cubs won the Western , Eastern , and Central divisions respectively . Meanwhile , the 2007 Mets underwent what was described in the New York Times as " one of the biggest collapses in baseball history " , becoming the first team with a seven @-@ game divisional lead with only 17 games remaining to finish outside of first place , losing the Eastern division to the Phillies on the final day of the season . Also , at 88 – 74 , the Mets finished a single game behind the Rockies and Padres ' 89 – 73 record in the wild @-@ card race . 
 While the Padres had been a consistent presence amongst the league 's top teams during the 2007 season , the Rockies finished the first half with a .500 record of 44 – 44 . They propelled themselves into the wild @-@ card race , however , by going 46 – 29 in the second half of the season including a Rockies ' season @-@ best 11 @-@ game winning streak from September 16 through September 27 and ultimately tied the Padres regular season record . With the Rockies and Padres holding the best non @-@ division winning records in the league a tie @-@ breaker was necessary to determine the wild @-@ card winner . A coin flip conducted earlier that September set the Rockies ' home park of Coors Field as the location for the game . 
 = = Game summary = = 
 Box score for Monday October 1 , 2007 — 5 : 37 p.m. ( MT ) at Coors Field in Denver , Colorado 
 The starting pitcher matchup saw eventual Cy Young Award and Major League Baseball Triple Crown winner Jake Peavy against the Rockies Josh Fogg , who teammate Matt Holliday nicknamed " Dragon Slayer " for his strong performances against ace starters throughout the season . The Rockies opened the bottom of the first inning with a leadoff double by Kaz Matsui , followed by a Troy Tulowitzki single and a walk to Matt Holliday to load the bases . Matsui scored on a sacrifice fly by Todd Helton and Garrett Atkins made the game 2 – 0 with a single which scored Tulowitzki . <unk> Torrealba later added to that lead , leading off the bottom of the second inning with a solo home run . The Padres took the lead in the top of the third , however , loading the bases via singles from Peavy and Scott Hairston and a walk to Brian Giles . Adrian Gonzalez then hit a grand slam home run , making the score 4 – 3 . This was Gonzalez ' first career grand slam . Khalil Greene then singled , advanced to third base on a double by Josh Bard , and scored on a ground out by Brady Clark . Helton homered in the bottom of the inning to close the gap to 5 – 4 in favor of San Diego . 
 The score remained the same through the fifth inning . Fogg was relieved by Taylor Buchholz in the top of the fifth and , following a double by Tulowitzki , Peavy allowed the game @-@ tying run to score on a Holliday single . Seth Smith , pinch hitting for the pitcher in the bottom of the sixth , hit a triple and then scored on a sacrifice fly by Matsui to give the Rockies a 6 – 5 lead . The Rockies ' Garrett Atkins appeared to homer in the bottom of the seventh , extending the Rockies lead , but umpires ruled that the ball hit padding on the outfield wall , which was still in play , and awarded Atkins a double . Jamey Carroll pinch ran for Atkins , but no runs scored in the inning . The Rockies brought in closer Brian Fuentes in the top of the 8th , but the Padres re @-@ tied the game when Geoff Blum singled to lead off the inning , advanced to second base on a wild pitch , and scored on a double by Brian Giles . This was Fuentes ' seventh blown save of the season . 
 The game remained tied through nine innings , forcing extra innings . There too the game stayed tied until the top of the 13th inning when Giles singled off of Jorge Julio and scored on a home run by Scott Hairston . Ramón Ortiz relieved Julio and no further runs scored in the inning , but the Padres entered the bottom of the 13th with an 8 – 6 lead . The Padres brought in Trevor Hoffman to secure the game and a wild @-@ card victory . However , Hoffman blew the save , allowing doubles to Matsui and Tulowitzki and a triple to Holliday which tied the game 8 – 8 . Hoffman then intentionally walked Todd Helton leaving baserunners at first and third base . Carroll then hit a line drive to right fielder Brian Giles . Holliday tagged up at third and slid headfirst on a close play at home plate . Home plate umpire Tim McClelland ruled Holliday safe on the sacrifice fly , and the Rockies won the game 9 – 8 . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 During the final play Padres catcher Michael Barrett attempted to block home plate from Holliday 's slide while receiving the ball on a throw from Brian Giles . Holliday arrived at the plate before the ball did and the ball bounced away from Barrett . Some controversy arose after the game as to whether Holliday had actually touched home plate or if Barrett had successfully blocked him . Several sportswriters , such as Jeff <unk> of Yahoo ! Sports and Mark Kiszla of The Denver Post , said outright that Holliday never touched the plate . Kiszla referred to the moment humorously , saying " When folks retell this story 100 years from now , he still will not have touched home plate . " Padres manager Bud Black and first base umpire Ed Montague both agreed with McClelland 's safe call . Barrett said he was unsure but " never , ever second @-@ guessed Tim McClelland at home plate . " If McClelland had ruled Holliday had not touched the plate during his slide Barrett would have had the chance to tag out Holliday , preventing the winning run . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Colorado 's win clinched the team 's second post @-@ season berth in franchise history , and the first for their first baseman Todd Helton . The Rockies swept the Phillies in the 2007 National League Division Series and the Diamondbacks in the 2007 National League Championship Series ( NLCS ) to win the franchise 's first National League pennant . This streak , in combination with the Rockies performance at the end of the season , meant the Rockies had won 21 of their last 22 games . The last National League team to win 20 of 21 games at any point in the season were the 1936 New York Giants . The Rockies also opened the playoffs with seven straight wins , the 1976 Cincinnati Reds were the only other team in major league history to do so . The Rockies moved on to the 2007 World Series with their NLCS win , where they were swept by the Boston Red Sox . 
 The game counted as a regular season game in baseball statistics . If Matt Holliday had gone 0 for 5 in the game he would have lost the batting title to Chipper Jones . However , Holliday went 2 for 6 and won the title with a batting average of .340 . Also , Holliday 's triple and run batted in ( RBI ) in the 13th gave him 137 RBI in total , winning the RBI crown over Ryan Howard by 1 . Holliday 's teammate Tulowitzki believed Holliday was the league 's most valuable player , but he ultimately finished a close second to the Phillies ' Jimmy Rollins in the Most Valuable Player Award voting . Also , Padres ' starter Jake Peavy increased his earned run average ( ERA ) from 2 @.@ 36 to 2 @.@ 54 in the game and added six strikeouts to his season total . Peavy ultimately won the National League wins , strikeout , and ERA titles . These titles combined to give Peavy a pitching Triple Crown and he went on to win the Cy Young Award unanimously . Finally , despite an error in the game , the Rockies set the single @-@ season major league record for team fielding percentage ( <unk> ) , breaking the 2006 Boston Red Sox mark of <unk> .

 Sol @-@ Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams is the second studio album by American R & B singer Solange Knowles , released August 26 , 2008 , on Polydor Records and Music World . Recording during 2005 to 2008 , Knowles was heavily influenced by the " Motown Sound " of the 1960s and 1970s during the album 's conception , prompting her to work with several vintage @-@ style producers and songwriters such as Jack Splash , CeeLo Green , Mark Ronson , and former Holland – Dozier – Holland composer Lamont Dozier . Exploring the lyrical theme of independence , it also incorporates elements of downbeat and electronic music that she had familiarized herself with on previous trips to Europe . 
 Deviating from the R & B and dance @-@ pop of Knowles ' debut album , Solo Star ( 2002 ) , Sol @-@ Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams featured promotion that aimed at an " intellectual , backpacking , coffee shop , digital kid " audience . The album debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200 chart , selling 46 @,@ 000 copies in its first week , and spawned three singles that attained chart success as number @-@ one Billboard Dance hits . Upon its release , Sol @-@ Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams received generally positive reviews from most music critics . As of April 2009 , it has sold 138 @,@ 000 copies in the United States .

 Knowles had been working on her second studio album on and off since 2005 following her return home to Houston , Texas , and her divorce from Daniel Smith , with whom she had lived following the birth of their son Daniel Julez in October 2004 . The follow @-@ up to the critical and commercial disappointment of 2003 's Solo Star was preceded by Knowles 's move from Columbia to Geffen Records in late 2007 . Knowles was heavily influenced by Motown girl groups such as The Supremes and The Marvelettes , and by her mother Tina , a one @-@ time member of the 1960s harmony group The <unk> , who used to play music by the likes of Dusty Springfield and Martha Reeves to her . Knowles decided to distance herself from the teen pop and dance @-@ pop @-@ oriented R & B sound mainly associated with her previous effort , Solo Star . 
 <unk> to create a concept album revolving around her growth as a musical artist instead , she eventually got into the idea of a " sweet , soulful record [ ... ] based around the Sixties and Seventies , telling stories of where I have been the last couple years . " Also borrowing elements from downbeat and electronic music she discovered on recent trips to Europe , her vision of the album eventually resulted in a mixture that Knowles has described as a " ' 60s / 70s vintage soul record with hints of electronica . " In an interview with Billboard magazine , Geffen Records chairman Ron Fair said of the album prior to release , " Her record is totally bananas ... It 's not what people would expect from her . The music is more electric and international . She 's in her own lane . " 
 = = Recording = = 
 Although Knowles had previously worked with a wide range of high @-@ profile producers and songwriters on earlier projects , she struggled to convince her <unk> musicians to contribute to Sol @-@ Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams , production @-@ wise . This was due to no producer signing on to the project before hearing any material for the album . " I don 't think it was offensive , " Knowles admitted . " I understand that these are people that want to take on credible passionate projects . So before I would work with them I would schedule a meeting and play them the record . And then they were more convinced and willing to get on board . " Cee @-@ Lo Green and Mark Ronson were not consulted until late into the production of the album , both having been persuaded by Knowles at the 50th Grammy Awards ceremony : " I had to party with Cee @-@ Lo too to get him to work on the record [ ... ] but once he did [ listen to my music ] he signed on immediately . " 
 Knowles collaborated with several studio personalities , including Jack Splash , Shea Taylor , Mr. Familiar , Lamont Dozier , production teams Soulshock & Karlin and Bama Boyz , as well as singers and rappers Pharrell Williams , Bilal , Q @-@ Tip and Lil Wayne respectively . In addition , Marsha Ambrosius of Floetry lent vocals to the unreleased recording " Wanna Go Back " , while Raphael Saadiq and British singer Estelle demoed the track " Same Song , Different Man " , which didn ’ t make it to the final track listing . In an interview with Starpulse , Knowles later said of the experience : 
 Inspired by the aspirations of Knowles 's father Mathew , the album was titled after Hadley Street , a plot of land in downtown Houston : " My father took me there one day and told me he was going to build a studio , " she said in an interview with the Daily Mail . " The title is a tribute to his vision . He had a plan and he saw it through . That was a real eye @-@ opener for me . It inspired me to dig out my old Marvin Gaye albums and start writing songs . "

 = = Critical reception = = 
 Sol @-@ Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams received generally positive reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 72 , based on 14 reviews . Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice called the album " bizarrely mesmerizing " and felt that some of the material 's idiosyncratic and unconventional lyrics invite " inexplicable but highly favorable comparisons to Kate Bush . ( Ethereal but powerful , unhinged but in total command . ) " Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe referred to the album as a " smartly executed , classy set of songs that 's miles away from the hoochie pop being turned out by young female R & B vocalists these days " . <unk> Elan of The Times declared the album " a modern classic " . Dan LeRoy of The Hartford Courant compared her work to that of sister Beyoncé Knowles , stating " Solange combines retro warmth and current cool in ways her more commercially successful sibling probably can 't . " Jaimie Gill of Yahoo ! Music called it a " fine , rich and extremely likeable record " , and Francis Jones of Hot Press called Solange 's singing " sassy and assured " . Andy Kellman of AllMusic cited it as " one of the year 's more entertaining and easily enjoyable R & B releases " and found it " fun , silly , slightly eccentric and , most importantly , fearless " : 
 In a mixed review , Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone cited Knowles 's attempts at Erykah Badu @-@ inspired psychedelic @-@ soul tracks such as " Cosmic Journey " , as well as her vocal abilities , as " embarrassing " , comparing the album 's sound to " a woozy lava lamp glow . " Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian called its music " savvy R & B with a gloss you can check your reflection in " , but ultimately observed " a lack of both memorable tunes and the steely spined ardour that makes Beyoncé so compelling . " Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was ambivalent towards its use of sampling on certain songs , but praised " the mix of organic , old @-@ school instrumentation and more electronic elements " , which he felt make it " a loose , fun and reverent record . " Writing for MSN Music , Robert Christgau gave the album a two @-@ star honorable mention ( ) , indicating a " likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy . " He cited " Would 've Been the One " and " I Decided , Pt . 1 " as highlights and quipped , " <unk> , defiantly , privilege 's child runs through her options " . Vibe 's Keith Murphy cited it as one of the R & B best albums of the year .

 = St Llibio 's Church , Llanllibio = 
 St Llibio 's Church , Llanllibio is a demolished church in Anglesey , north Wales . Founded by Llibio in the sixth century , the church served a small community of bondmen as a chapel of ease . The population of Llanllibio declined substantially during the Middle Ages as a result of the Black Death and changes in farming practice , amongst other factors , and the community that the church served effectively disappeared . As a result , St Llibio 's closed in the seventeenth century ; the remaining worshippers moved to another local church . 
 Plans in the nineteenth century to rebuild the church , which was in ruins by 1776 , came to nothing . Except for a memorial stone , nothing more than " tiny traces " of St Llibio 's can now be seen . 
 = = Early history = = 
 St Llibio 's was the church for Llanllibio in Anglesey , north Wales . A survey of Anglesey conducted in 1352 records Llanllibio as a tir <unk> township , a Welsh form of land tenure in which the inhabitants , who were generally few in number , were bondmen working for the lord in return for a small arable holding and some grazing rights . It was the only tir <unk> township in Anglesey to have a church . Like many other communities in Anglesey , and elsewhere in medieval Wales , Llanllibio 's population decreased substantially during the Middle Ages , and the settlement effectively disappeared . Communities such as Llanllibio were affected by the Black Death , the destruction resulting from the revolt of Owen <unk> , by changes in land tenure , and by new farming practices that reduced the need for tied labour . 
 The parish was on the old road between London and the Anglesey port town of Holyhead , and about 0 @.@ 8 miles ( 1 @.@ 3 km ) from Bodedern . The church was dedicated to St Llibio , a sixth @-@ century monk , confessor , and disciple of the Anglesey saint Cybi . Llibio himself is recorded as having founded a church on the site , and his feast day was celebrated on 28 February . The area took its name from the church : the Welsh word " llan " originally meant " enclosure " and then " church " . 
 St Llibio 's was used as a chapel of ease to the Church of St <unk> , St Ieuan and St <unk> , Llantrisant , about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) away . 
 = = Closure = = 
 St Llibio 's was closed in the seventeenth century , and the church at Llantrisant was enlarged to accommodate worshippers from Llanllibio . By 1776 St Llibio 's was in ruins . According to Angharad Llwyd , a historian of Anglesey writing in 1833 , the inhabitants of the area attended worship at St Edern 's Church , Bodedern . She noted that Wynne Jones , the rector of Llantrisant , hoped to rebuild the church , but that did not happen . 
 A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire stated that " the church has entirely disappeared , but the foundations of the churchyard wall are still visible . " A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that " only tiny traces " of the church can be seen , adding that a memorial slate marks its location . 
 = Delphine LaLaurie = 
 Born Marie Delphine Macarty or Maccarthy , ( c . 1780 – 1849 ) , more commonly known as Madame LaLaurie , was a New Orleans Creole socialite and alleged serial killer , infamous for torturing and likely murdering her household slaves . 
 Born during the Spanish colonial period , Delphine Macarty married three times in Louisiana , having twice been widowed . She maintained her position in New Orleans society until April 10 , 1834 , when rescuers responded to a fire at her Royal Street mansion and discovered bound slaves in her attic who showed evidence of cruel , violent treatment over a long period . Lalaurie 's house was subsequently sacked by an outraged mob of New Orleans citizens . She escaped to France with her family . 
 The mansion where Lalaurie lived is a landmark in the French Quarter , in part because of its history and in part because there were relatively few homes of such massive size in the Quarter . 
 = = Early life and family history = = 
 Marie Delphine Macarty was born 1780 , one of five children . Her father was Louis Barthelemy Macarty , originally Chevalier de Maccarthy ) whose father Barthelemy ( de ) Maccarthy brought the family to New Orleans from Ireland around 1730 , during the French colonial period . ( The Irish surname Maccarthy was shortened to Macarty or de Macarty . ) Her mother was Marie Jeanne Lovable , also known as " the widow Lecomte " , whose marriage to Louis B. Macarty was her second . Both were prominent in the town 's white Creole community . Delphine 's cousin , Augustin de Macarty , was mayor of New Orleans from 1815 to 1820 . 
 = = First marriage and death of husband = = 
 On June 11 , 1800 , Mlle. Marie Delphine Macarty married Don Ramón de Lopez y Angulo , a Caballero de la Royal de Carlos , a high @-@ ranking Spanish royal officer , at the Saint Louis Cathedral in New Orleans . Luisiana , as it was spelled in Spanish , had become a Spanish colony in the 1760s . In 1804 , after the American acquisition , Don Ramón had been appointed to the position of consul general for Spain in the Territory of Orleans . 
 Also , in 1804 , Delphine and Ramón Lopez traveled to Spain . Accounts of the trip vary . Grace King wrote in 1921 that the trip was Lopez 's " military punishment " and that Señora Delphine Lopez met the Queen , who was impressed with Mrs. Lopez 's beauty . Stanley Arthur 's 1936 report differed ; he stated that on March 26 , 1804 , Don Ramón Lopez was recalled to Spain " to take his place at court as befitting his new position , " but that Lopez never arrived in Madrid because he died in en route , in Havana . 
 During the voyage , Delphine gave birth to a daughter , named Marie @-@ Borja / Borgia Delphine Lopez y Angulo de la Candelaria , nicknamed <unk> . Delphine and her daughter returned to New Orleans afterwards . 
 = = Second marriage and death of husband = = 
 In June 1808 , Delphine married Jean Blanque , a prominent banker , merchant , lawyer , and legislator . At the time of the marriage , Blanque purchased a house at 409 Royal Street in New Orleans for the family , which became known later as the Villa Blanque . Delphine had four more children by Blanque , named Marie Louise Pauline , Louise Marie Laure , Marie Louise Jeanne , and Jeanne Pierre Paulin <unk> died in 1816 . 
 = = Third marriage = = 
 Delphine married her third husband , physician Leonard Louis Nicolas LaLaurie , who was much younger than she , on June 25 , 1825 . In 1831 , she bought property at 1140 Royal Street , which she managed in her own name with little involvement of her husband , and in 1832 had built a three @-@ story mansion there , complete with attached slave quarters . She lived there with her third husband and two of her daughters , and maintained a central position in New Orleans society . 
 = = Torture and murder of slaves and 1834 LaLaurie mansion fire = = 
 The <unk> maintained several black slaves in slave quarters , attached to the Royal Street mansion . Accounts of Delphine Lalaurie 's treatment of her slaves between 1831 and 1834 are mixed . Harriet Martineau , writing in 1838 and recounting tales told to her by New Orleans residents during her 1836 visit , claimed Lalaurie 's slaves were observed to be " singularly haggard and wretched ; " however , in public appearances Lalaurie was seen to be generally polite to black people and solicitous of her slaves ' health , and court records of the time showed that Lalaurie manumitted two of her own slaves ( Jean Louis in 1819 and <unk> in 1832 ) . Nevertheless , Martineau reported that public rumors about Lalaurie 's mistreatment of her slaves were sufficiently widespread that a local lawyer was dispatched to Royal Street to remind LaLaurie of the laws relevant to the upkeep of slaves . During this visit , the lawyer found no evidence of wrongdoing or mistreatment of slaves by Lalaurie . 
 Martineau also recounted other tales of Lalaurie 's cruelty that were current among New Orleans residents in about 1836 . She claimed that , subsequent to the visit of the local lawyer , one of Lalaurie 's neighbors saw one of the LaLaurie 's slaves , a twelve @-@ year @-@ old girl named Lia ( or Leah ) , fall to her death from the roof of the Royal Street mansion while trying to avoid punishment from a whip @-@ wielding Delphine LaLaurie . Lia had been brushing Delphine 's hair when she hit a snag , causing Delphine to grab a whip and chase her . The body was subsequently buried on the mansion grounds . According to Martineau , this incident led to an investigation of the Lalauries , in which they were found guilty of illegal cruelty and forced to forfeit nine slaves . These nine slaves were then bought back by the Lalauries through the intermediary of one of their relatives , and returned to the Royal Street residences . Similarly , Martineau reported stories that LaLaurie kept her cook chained to the kitchen stove , and beat her daughters when they attempted to feed the slaves . 
 On April 10 , 1834 , a fire broke out in the LaLaurie residence on Royal Street , starting in the kitchen . When the police and fire marshals got there , they found a seventy @-@ year @-@ old woman , the cook , chained to the stove by her ankle . She later confessed to them that she had set the fire as a suicide attempt for fear of her punishment , being taken to the uppermost room , because she said that anyone who was taken there never came back . As reported in the New Orleans Bee of April 11 , 1834 , bystanders responding to the fire attempted to enter the slave quarters to ensure that everyone had been evacuated . Upon being refused the keys by the Lalauries , the bystanders broke down the doors to the slave quarters and found " seven slaves , more or less horribly mutilated ... suspended by the neck , with their limbs apparently stretched and torn from one extremity to the other " , who claimed to have been imprisoned there for some months . 
 One of those who entered the premises was Judge Jean @-@ Francois Canonge , who subsequently deposed to having found in the LaLaurie mansion , among others , a " <unk> ... wearing an iron collar " and " an old negro woman who had received a very deep wound on her head [ who was ] too weak to be able to walk . " Canonge claimed , that when he questioned Madame LaLaurie 's husband about the slaves , he was told in an insolent manner that " some people had better stay at home rather than come to others ' houses to dictate laws and meddle with other people 's business . " 
 A version of this story circulating in 1836 , recounted by Martineau , added that the slaves were emaciated , showed signs of being flayed with a whip , were bound in restrictive postures , and wore spiked iron collars which kept their heads in static positions . 
 When the discovery of the tortured slaves became widely known , a mob of local citizens attacked the Lalaurie residence and " demolished and destroyed everything upon which they could lay their hands " . A sheriff and his officers were called upon to disperse the crowd , but by the time the mob left , the Royal Street property had sustained major damage , with " scarcely any thing [ remaining ] but the walls . " The tortured slaves were taken to a local jail , where they were available for public viewing . The New Orleans Bee reported that by April 12 up to 4 @,@ 000 people had attended to view the tortured slaves " to convince themselves of their sufferings . " 
 The Pittsfield Sun , citing the New Orleans Advertiser and writing several weeks after the evacuation of LaLaurie 's slave quarters , claimed that two of the slaves found in the LaLaurie mansion had died since their rescue , and added , " We understand ... that in digging the yard , bodies have been disinterred , and the condemned well [ in the grounds of the mansion ] having been uncovered , others , particularly that of a child , were found . " These claims were repeated by Martineau in her 1838 book Retrospect of Western Travel , where she placed the number of unearthed bodies at two , including the child . 
 = = Escape from justice and self @-@ imposed , exile in France = = 
 Delphine LaLaurie 's life after the 1834 fire is not well documented . Martineau wrote in 1838 , that LaLaurie fled New Orleans during the mob violence that followed the fire , taking a coach to the waterfront and travelling , by schooner , from there to Mobile , Alabama and then on to Paris . Certainly by the time Martineau personally visited the Royal Street mansion in 1836 it was still unoccupied and badly damaged , with " gaping windows and empty walls " . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 The circumstances of her death are also unclear . George Washington Cable recounted in 1888 , a then @-@ popular but unsubstantiated story , that LaLaurie had died in France , in a boar @-@ hunting accident . Whatever the truth , in the late 1930s , Eugene Backes , who served as sexton to St. Louis Cemetery # 1 until 1924 , discovered an old cracked , copper plate in Alley 4 of the cemetery . The inscription on the plate read " Madame LaLaurie , née Marie Delphine Maccarthy , <unk> à Paris , le 7 Décembre , 1842 , à l <unk> de <unk> . " 
 According to the French archives of Paris , however , Marie Delphine Maccarthy died on December 7 , 1849 . 
 = = LaLaurie mansion = = 
 The New Orleans house occupied by Delphine LaLaurie at the time of the 1834 fires stands today at 1140 Royal Street , on the corner of Royal Street and Governor Nicholls Street ( formerly known as Hospital Street ) . At three stories high , it was described in 1928 as " the highest building for squares around " , with the result that " from the cupola on the roof one may look out over the Vieux Carré and see the Mississippi in its crescent before Jackson Square " . The entrance to the building bears iron grillwork , and the door is carved with an image of " Phoebus in his chariot , and with wreaths of flowers and depending garlands in bas @-@ relief " . Inside , the vestibule is floored in black and white marble , and a curved mahogany @-@ railed staircase runs the full three stories of the building . The second floor holds three large drawing rooms connected by ornamented sliding doors , whose walls are decorated with plaster rosettes , carved woodwork , black marble mantle pieces and fluted pilasters . 
 Subsequent to LaLaurie 's departure from America , the house remained ruined at least until 1836 , but at some point prior to 1888 it was " <unk> restored " , and over the following decades was used as a public high school , a conservatory of music , a tenement , a refuge for young delinquents , a bar , a furniture store , and a luxury apartment building . 
 In April 2007 , Nicolas Cage bought the LaLaurie House through Hancock Park Real Estate Company , LLC , for a sum of $ 3 @.@ 45 million . The mortgage documents were arranged in such a way that Cage 's name did not appear on them . On November 13 , 2009 , the property , then valued at $ 3 @.@ 5 million , was listed for auction as a result of bank foreclosure and purchased by Regions Financial Corporation for $ 2 @.@ 3 million . 
 = = LaLaurie in folklore = = 
 Folk histories of Lalaurie 's poor treatment of her slaves circulated in Louisiana during the nineteenth century , and were reprinted in collections of stories by Henry Castellanos and George Washington Cable . Cable 's account ( not to be confused with his unrelated 1881 novel Madame Delphine ) was based on contemporary stories in newspapers such as the New Orleans Bee and the Advertiser , and upon Martineau 's 1838 account , Retrospect of Western Travel , but mixed in some synthesis , dialogue and supposition entirely of his own creation . 
 After 1945 , stories of the Lalaurie slaves became considerably more explicit . Jeanne deLavigne , writing in Ghost Stories of Old New Orleans ( 1946 ) , alleged that Lalaurie had a " sadistic appetite [ that ] seemed never appeased until she had inflicted on one or more of her black servitors some hideous form of torture " and claimed that those who responded to the 1834 fire had found " male slaves , stark naked , chained to the wall , their eyes gouged out , their fingernails pulled off by the roots ; others had their joints skinned and festering , great holes in their buttocks where the flesh had been sliced away , their ears hanging by shreds , their lips sewn together ... Intestines were pulled out and knotted around naked waists . There were holes in skulls , where a rough stick had been inserted to stir the brains . " DeLavigne did not directly cite any sources for these claims , and they were not supported by the primary sources . 
 The story was further popularized and embellished in Journey Into Darkness : Ghosts and Vampires of New Orleans ( 1998 ) by Kalila Katherina Smith , the operator of a New Orleans ghost tour business . Smith 's book added several more explicit details to the discoveries allegedly made by rescuers during the 1834 fire , including a " victim [ who ] obviously had her arms amputated and her skin peeled off in a circular pattern , making her look like a human caterpillar , " and another who had had her limbs broken and reset " at odd angles so she resembled a human crab " . Many of the new details in Smith 's book were unsourced , while others were not supported by the sources given . 
 Today , modern re @-@ tellings of the Lalaurie legend often use deLavigne and Smith 's versions of the tale to found claims of explicit tortures , and to place the number of slaves who died under Lalaurie 's care at as many as one hundred . 
 = = In popular culture = = 
 The former , now defunct , historically @-@ themed wax museum in the French Quarter , the Musée Conti Wax Museum , on Conti Street , traditionally included a scene depicting abused slaves in Madame LaLaurie 's attic . 
 Poet Jennifer Reeser has written a poem in terza rima titled " The Lalaurie Horror " , chronicling the mansion 's history and folklore , done as a poetic " ghost tour " . 
 In 2000 , Ted Nicolaou directed a found footage movie called The St. Francisville Experiment about people who spend the night in a disused Louisiana plantation house and encounter hostile ghosts . While not the LaLaurie house in New Orleans , the plantation house is one location LaLaurie is alleged to have fled to after the 1834 fire incident . The fictional camera crew finds physical and supernatural evidence suggesting , that LaLaurie did indeed flee to the house and continue her cruelty there . 
 In 2004 , James <unk> directed " Trespassing , " aka " Evil Remains , " about a grad student of folklore leading his friends on a research expedition to an old plantation estate near New Orleans . The site , once the home of a woman whose backstory is directly taken from the bio of LaLaurie , is reputed to mysteriously cause madness and death to all who enter it . 
 Kathy Bates portrays a heavily fictionalized Delphine LaLaurie in the 2014 third season of the American anthology horror television series American Horror Story .

 " Get It Right " is a song performed by the cast of American television series Glee , taken from their sixth soundtrack album , Glee : The Music , Volume 5 . It is sung by Lea Michele who portrays the series ' lead character , Rachel Berry . The song was written by the series ' music producer Adam Anders , who created the song with his wife Nikki Hassman , and writing partner Peer Åström . Anders and company wrote the song specifically for Michele , and based the lyrics on the storyline of Rachel . The song was released with a number of Glee songs on the iTunes Store on March 15 , 2011 . Musically , " Get It Right " is a piano @-@ driven pop ballad , with mild country influences . According to MTV 's Aly Semigran , the song has similarities to Britney Spears ' Everytime " ( 2004 ) . 
 While critics praised Michele 's vocals in the song , they were not as receptive to the song itself with it being coined as " dull " and " boring . " The lyrics of the song revolve around self @-@ doubt over a lost relationship . The song debuted at number sixteen on the US Billboard Hot 100 , and appeared in the top forty in three other countries . The song 's performance was featured in the Glee episode " Original Song " which first aired on March 15 , 2011 in which Berry ( Michele ) used a bedazzled microphone , backed by Brittany Pierce ( Heather Morris ) and Tina Cohen @-@ Chang ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) .

" Basically , you try to do everything right and you have good motivations with everything you ’ re doing but everything ends up going wrong . How many times will it take for me to get it right ? " 
 In an interview with TV Guide Anders expressed the same sentiments , responding , " I 've watched Rachel struggle .

' " Voerding also said that Michele 's " clean voice bites under and glides above timeless lyrics of self @-@ doubt over love recently lost . " Lyrically the song is based upon the storyline of Michele 's character , Rachel Berry , which involves her watching her ex , Finn Hudson ( Cory Monteith ) , leave her and get back with his ex @-@ girlfriend Quinn Fabray ( Dianna Agron ) . According to Aly Semigran of MTV News the song 's opening moments are similar to " Everytime " by Britney Spears , and features " fluttering piano and breathy vocals " that come " into its own as it builds .

 Reviewing the track for AOL Radio Blog , Voerding wrote " Michele 's voice is among the cast 's most versatile , striding confidently through growls and whispers , proclamations and wavering cries . This single , with the drive of its melody and narrative , is no exception . " Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer called Michele 's voice on the song " phenomenal , " and commented " I love how her vocals are reined in , and then build up to that wonderful glory note . I seriously got chills while listening to it . " She also commented how the song 's narrative fit Michele 's storyline on the show . Christopher Rosen of Movieline wrote " If you love Lea Michele ’ s voice , you ’ ll like " Get It Right . " Becky Bain of Idolator said " This one , compared to the instantly catchy “ Loser Like Me ” , is a bit more underwhelming , though Lea kills it . " Jarret Wieselman of The New York Post said " Lea Michele 's voice was on point throughout this soaring ballad , but without that secret ingredient , lyrics like " my best intentions keep making a mess of things " are best left to Rachel 's diary . " Although she called it " boring " and said it was like every other reflection @-@ ballad performed by Michele , Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone said that the song would fit in on Top 40 radio . Melinda Newman of HitFix said the song was " lovely , but a bit dull . "

 = Himura Kenshin = 
 Himura Kenshin ( <unk> <unk> ) , known as Kenshin Himura in the English @-@ language anime dubs , is a fictional character and protagonist of the Rurouni Kenshin manga created by Nobuhiro Watsuki . When creating Kenshin , Watsuki designed him to be the physical opposite of Hiko Seijūrō , a character that appears in Watsuki 's first one @-@ shot manga , " Crescent Moon in the Warring States " ; a character with the same name appears in Rurouni Kenshin as Kenshin 's swordsmanship teacher . 
 Kenshin 's story is set in a fictional version of Japan during the Meiji period . Kenshin is a former legendary assassin known as " Hitokiri Battōsai " ( <unk> ) ( rendered as <unk> the <unk> in the Media Blasters English anime dub , as <unk> : The Slasher in the Sony English dub , and as The <unk> on the Japanese kanzenban covers ) , more properly named Himura Battōsai ( <unk> ) . At the end of the Bakumatsu , he becomes a wandering samurai , now wielding a sakabatō ( <unk> , lit . " reverse @-@ blade sword " ) , a katana that has the cutting edge on the inwardly curved side of the sword , thus being nearly incapable of killing . Kenshin wanders the countryside of Japan offering protection and aid to those in need , as atonement for the murders he once committed as an assassin . In Tokyo , he meets a young woman named Kamiya Kaoru , who invites him to live in her dojo despite learning about Kenshin 's past . Throughout the series , Kenshin begins to establish lifelong relationships with many people , including ex @-@ enemies , while dealing with his fair share of enemies , new and old . 
 Kenshin 's character was well received by fans , with his holding the top spot in all reader popularity polls for the series . Critics of the series praised his personality , though some complained about his development during the original video animation ( OVA ) series , which differs from the manga . A variety of collectibles based around Kenshin have been created , including figurines , key chains , plushies , and replicas of his sakabatō sword .

 Himura Kenshin , real name Shinta ( <unk> ) , was born on June 20 , 1849 . As a former legendary assassin , Kenshin is an extremely powerful swordsman with virtually unmatched skills . Kenshin practices the Hiten Mitsurugi @-@ ryū ( <unk> , lit . " Flying Heaven Honorable Sword Style " ) , a fictional ancient sword art which can be based on <unk> , that enables him to exercise superhuman speed and reflexes , study and predict his opponent 's movements in battle , as well as perform many powerful sword techniques . Most of his techniques were originally intended to be lethal , but Kenshin has since modified his usage of such techniques in accordance with his vow never to kill . To this end , he fights using his sakabatō ( A reversed @-@ edge sword ) . 
 After finishing his job as the murderer " Hitokiri Battōsai " in the Ishin Shishi , Kenshin assumes the life of a wanderer . Ten years after the Revolution , he arrives in Tokyo , where he meets Kamiya Kaoru . She invites him to stay in her dojo even after she discovers that Kenshin is the " Battōsai " . During his residence in the dojo , Kenshin establishes lifelong relationships with many people , including ex @-@ enemies , such as the former Shinsengumi member Saitō Hajime . Kenshin desires to protect every individual from danger without harming others . Formerly known as " the strongest hitokiri , " Kenshin is the main target of many old enemies and people who want to gain his title . Thus , he avoids letting others get too close to him personally for their own protection . However , he eventually begins relying on his friends , allowing them to fight alongside him . 
 When Shishio Makoto , the brutal once @-@ successor to Kenshin 's position as Chōshū 's hitokiri , masterminds a movement seeking to overthrow the Meiji Government , Kenshin leaves Tokyo to stop him . To defeat such a foe , Kenshin is forced to resume his training and mend his relationship with his teacher Seijūrō , who taught and took care of Kenshin , originally named Shinta , in his childhood . That childhood training was interrupted when Kenshin decided to protect the people of Japan . He learns the Kuzu @-@ ryūsen ( <unk> , lit . " Nine @-@ headed Dragon Strike " ) , which deals nine simultaneous strikes to the fundamental targets of swordsmanship . The Kuzu @-@ ryūsen , however , is a byproduct used for the initiation in learning <unk> Ryū no Hirameki ( <unk> , lit . " Heavens Gliding Dragon Flash " ; Viz translation - " Dragon Flight of Heaven " ) , a Hiten Mitsurugi @-@ ryū <unk> that surpasses the speed of the Kuzu @-@ ryūsen . If the strike is avoided or blocked , the force of the unusually fast slashing motion displaces the air around it , generating a vacuum in its wake and sucking the opponent in ; as this happens , the body is spun around for a second stronger strike . Throughout the training , Kenshin also develops a desire to survive to any combat so that Kaoru will not be shocked by his death . After finishing his training , all Kenshin 's friends reunite with him and help him to defeat Shishio and his army . 
 Months later , a man known as Yukishiro Enishi starts attacking all people that Kenshin meets as an act of revenge for the death of his sister Yukishiro Tomoe . At this moment , it is discovered that Kenshin was married to Tomoe in the Bakumatsu but accidentally killed her when trying to rescue her from a group of assassins . When Enishi finds out about Kenshin 's feelings towards Kaoru , Enishi sets out to kidnap her . He succeeds and leaves behind a professionally made decoy of Kaoru with a sword in her heart , making everyone believe that she had been murdered . Kenshin falls into severe depression and runs off to a village of wanderers to mourn . However , he breaks out of his depression after his friends discover Kaoru is alive . The group goes to rescue her on Enishi 's island . A battle between Kenshin and Enishi follows and when Kenshin wins , he and Kaoru return home . Afterwards , Kenshin learns that since the Hiten Mitsurugi @-@ ryū is only suitable to a wide @-@ framed muscular build like that of Seijūrō 's , his body eventually began to deteriorate and soon he will be unable to use it ever again . Five years later , Kenshin is married to Kaoru and has a son named Kenji . After an encounter with Kaoru 's student Myōjin Yahiko , Kenshin gives his sakabatō to him as a gift for his coming @-@ of @-@ age . 
 = = Creation and conception = = 
 Watsuki discovered and used the story of Kawakami <unk> , a hitokiri ( <unk> , literally " <unk> " ) executed by the Meiji Government . According to Watsuki , when he found that Kawakami maintained a duty to his dead comrades , he decided to create the title character . Since Watsuki 's debut work contained a tall , black @-@ haired man in " showy " armor , the creator wanted to make a character " completely opposite " to the debut character and the new character ended up " coming out like a girl . " According to Watsuki , he used " no real motif " when creating Kenshin and placed a cross @-@ shaped scar when " not knowing what else to do . " 
 During the development of the pilot chapter of the series , Rurouni , Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story , Watsuki and his editor argued over Kenshin 's speech patterns ; they settled for a " slangy " pattern . For the final version of the first Romantic Story , Watsuki adjusted the dialogue ; in his view , he made Kenshin sound " more as I prefer him now . " Watsuki added Kenshin 's trademark " oro " ( <unk> ) as a placeholder to be an expression of the English speech <unk> " huh " . Watsuki notes that he was surprised at how much it caught on , and how much he ended up having Kenshin use the sound during the series . Watsuki also planned to make Kenshin older than 30 years old ; his editor commented that it was strange that the main character of a manga for teenagers was so old , so he made Kenshin 28 years old . 
 At the end of the series , Kenshin appears with short hair . Initially , Watsuki had planned to make his hair shorter before the end , however , he found this to be similar to the character Multi from To Heart . Watsuki based most of Kenshin 's abilities on a real swordsman of the Tokugawa period named <unk> <unk> , who was skilled in acrobatic techniques . During his fight against Shishio Makoto 's army , Kenshin is given a new sword with a sheath made of wood . Watsuki decided to redesign the sword to make it look as the first one Kenshin had in the series , though it is more difficult to draw . 
 In the first Rurouni Kenshin kanzenban , published in Japan in July 2006 , Watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of Kenshin 's character . To make his X @-@ shaped scar more notable , Watsuki made it long enough to cross his nose . Kenshin 's hair is tied in two tails , which are flowing to make him look younger , but shorter , to be less androgynous . Watsuki also added a <unk> to Kenshin 's sword to make it easier to draw by simplifying its structure , while also emphasizing strength . Kenshin 's hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly , by making his clothes more damaged and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe 's neck scarf . 
 In the anime adaptation of Rurouni Kenshin , Watsuki 's designs were combined with the voice talents of Mayo Suzukaze , a voice actress . In producing the English dub version of the series , Media Blasters considered following suit , with Mona Marshall considered as a finalist for voicing Kenshin . Richard Hayworth eventually was selected for the role , giving Kenshin 's character a more masculine voice in the English adaptation . Additionally , Marshall was selected to voice the younger Kenshin during flashback scenes . Clark Cheng , writer of the Media Blasters dub script , said that localizing Kenshin 's unusual speech was a difficult process . His use of " de gozaru " and " oro " were not only character trademarks that indicated Kenshin 's state of mind , but important elements to the story . However , neither is directly translatable to English , and in the end the company chose to replace " de gozaru " with " that I did , " " that I am , " or " that I do . " Kenshin 's signature " oro " was replaced with " <unk> " to simulate it being a " funny sound " that had no real meaning . Daryl Surat of Otaku USA said that the grammar in Kenshin 's dialogue in the Media Blasters dub and subtitles resemble the grammar in the dialogue of Yoda , a character in Star Wars .

 Kenshin first appeared in two chapters of Rurouni , Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story , the pilot chapters of the manga , in which he arrives in Tokyo and defeats several groups of villains attacking families . In these stories , Kenshin is given a similar personality to the one he has in the series , but his name is unmentioned . 
 Later , in the movie Rurouni Kenshin : The Motion Picture , Kenshin meets a samurai named Takimi Shigure , who tries to overthrow the Meiji Government and avenge the deaths of his family during the Bakumatsu . Kenshin encounters Shigure and defeats him in order to avoid the start of a war . 
 In the OVAs , Kenshin is given a more humanized design . There are also numerous changes to his life story compared to that of the manga , including the way he received his X @-@ shaped scar in Rurouni Kenshin : Trust & Betrayal . In Rurouni Kenshin : Reflection , as time passes , Kenshin becomes tortured anew by the guilt of leading a happy life after such a destructive past . He makes the decision to wander again , and Kaoru strongly supports him , promising to welcome him home with a smile and their child . Kenshin eventually becomes ravaged by an unknown disease . However , he decides to assist in the First Sino @-@ Japanese War as he had promised the Meiji Government . After the war 's end , Sagara Sanosuke discovers a gravely injured Kenshin on the shore , who lost his memories and thus cannot come back to Japan . Sanosuke arranges for Kenshin 's return to Tokyo and Kaoru . The two finally meet , and Kenshin collapses into her arms as he clutches her to him . Kaoru then notices Kenshin 's scar has faded away , signifying his death . Nobuhiro Watsuki , after watching the last OVA , was quite unhappy with how the story ended , saying that " Kenshin went through so much crap and deserved a happy ending . " 
 Kenshin is a playable character in all of the Rurouni Kenshin video games , including Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars . In June 2013 , Kenshin was confirmed to be a playable character alongside Bleach 's Ichigo Kurosaki in J @-@ Stars Victory Vs for the PlayStation 3 . 
 The manga reboot Rurouni Kenshin : Restoration follows Kenshin 's stay in Tokyo as in the original series . Before the reboot , Watsuki also wrote a prequel chapter where Kenshin meets a western doctor during his years of wandering . 
 In the live @-@ action movie trilogy , Kenshin is portrayed by Takeru Satoh . Watsuki was surprised by Satoh 's work as well as the special effects in the first film which made Kenshin 's character realistic . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Kenshin has been highly popular with the Rurouni Kenshin reader base , having ranked first in every Shonen Jump popularity poll of the series , always with more than double the votes of second place . Two polls by the official Rurouni Kenshin anime featured Kenshin as one the series ' most popular characters . In the first , Kenshin was at the top , while in the second he placed second . His Battōsai incarnation was also fifth in the latter one . Watsuki received letters from fans describing Megumi Ogata 's CD book voice as a " good fit " for Kenshin . Watsuki said that he imagined Kenshin 's voice to be " more neutral . " The fact that the CD book voice actors , especially Ogata and Tomokazu Seki , who portrayed Sanosuke , did not get their corresponding roles in the anime disappointed Watsuki . He has also been featured various times in the Animage 's Anime Grand Prix polls , ranking as one of the most popular male anime characters . 
 An abundance of merchandise have been released in Kenshin 's likeness including keychains , action figures , and plush dolls . Since the manga was published , non @-@ functional and functional sakabatō have been produced for purchase by collectors and fans . 
 Several publications for manga , anime , video games , and other media have provided praise and criticism on the character . T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews criticized that Kenshin 's super deformed appearance in comedy scenes does not suit the context of the character and the series . Mania.com remarks that Kenshin has a " smartass " attitude in a review of volume 8 ; while they noted that is a common attitude in the anime that makes him look out @-@ of @-@ character . Anime News Network praises Kenshin for being a character that all people enjoy watching due to his comedy scenes . SciFi.com remarked " Kenshin 's schizoid personal conflict between his ruthless @-@ killer side and his <unk> bumpkin " as a perfect way to develop good stories . In About.com 's " Top 8 Anime Love Stories " , Kenshin and Kaoru 's relationship ranked 8th with Katherine Luther noting it a " classic romance . " He was also fifth in IGN 's Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie describing him as " A classic example of a classic anime type , the peace @-@ loving killing machine " . In a Newtype poll from March 2010 , Kenshin was voted as the eighth most popular male anime character from the 1990s . Kenshin 's <unk> Ryū no Hirameki technique has ranked third in a Japanese survey that featured the most popular moves in manga and anime . In 2014 , IGN ranked him as the fifth greatest anime character of all time , saying that " Although Kenshin 's momentary lapses make him a complete badass and set the stage for some of the most epic sword battles ever animated , Kenshin always goes back to his sweet persona once the danger is gone . " 
 The development of Kenshin in the Rurouni Kenshin : Reflection OVA series has had negative reviews by many publications . Anime News Network also adds that in Reflection he " continues to be his old mopey self " and criticizes that he never says " oro " , while IGN cited that some moments of the relationship between Kenshin and Kaoru were depressing . However , some reviewers noted Kenshin 's personality in the OVAs to be one of the most complex to ever be animated remarking the fact that he can not forget his bloody past , despite having a peaceful life . In an interview with Mayo Suzukaze , who is the voice actress for the character , says that she started feeling similar to Kenshin after years of work as his voice , and comments that providing the voice for the character was one of her best experiences . 
 For the 9th Asian Film Awards , Takeru Satoh was nominated in the category " Best Actor " for Kenshin . 
 = Deptford = 
 Deptford ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ ford ) is an area of South @-@ East London , England , located mainly within the London Borough of Lewisham and partly within the Royal Borough of Greenwich . 
 From the mid @-@ 16th to the late 19th century , Deptford was home to Deptford Dockyard , the first Royal Navy Dockyard . The area declined as the Royal Navy moved out and commercial docks shut ; the last dock , Convoys Wharf , closed in 2000 . 
 Historically a part of Kent , Deptford became a Metropolitan Borough in 1900 . This became part of Inner London in 1965 , within the newly created county of Greater London . 
 = = History = = 
 Deptford began life as a ford of the Ravensbourne ( near what is now Deptford Bridge DLR station ) along the route of the Celtic trackway which was later paved by the Romans and developed into the medieval Watling Street . The modern name is a corruption of " deep ford " . Deptford was part of the pilgrimage route from London to Canterbury used by the pilgrims in Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales , and is mentioned in the Prologue to the " Reeve 's Tale " . The ford developed into first a wooden then a stone bridge , and in 1497 saw the Battle of Deptford Bridge , in which rebels from Cornwall , led by Michael An Gof , marched on London protesting against punitive taxes , but were soundly beaten by the King 's forces . 
 A second settlement developed as a modest fishing village on the Thames until Henry VIII used that site for a royal dock repairing , building and supplying ships , after which it grew in size and importance , shipbuilding remaining in operation until March 1869 . Trinity House , the organisation concerned with the safety of navigation around the British Isles , was formed in Deptford in 1514 , with its first Master being Thomas <unk> , captain of the Mary Rose . It moved to Stepney in 1618 . The name " Trinity House " derives from the church of Holy Trinity and St Clement , which adjoined the dockyard . 
 Originally separated by market gardens and fields , the two areas merged over the years , with the docks becoming an important part of the Elizabethan exploration . Queen Elizabeth I visited the royal dockyard on 4 April 1581 to knight the adventurer Francis Drake . As well as for exploration , Deptford was important for trade - the Honourable East India Company had a yard in Deptford from 1607 until late in the 17th century , later ( 1825 ) taken over by the General Steam Navigation Company . It was also connected with the slave trade , John Hawkins using it as a base for his operations , and Olaudah Equiano , the slave who became an important part of the abolition of the slave trade , was sold from one ship 's captain to another in Deptford around 1760 . 
 Diarist John Evelyn lived in Deptford at Sayes Court from 1652 . Evelyn inherited the house when he married the daughter of Sir Richard Browne in 1652 . On his return to England at the Restoration , Evelyn laid out meticulously planned gardens in the French style , of hedges and parterres . In its grounds was a cottage at one time rented by master woodcarver Grinling Gibbons . After Evelyn had moved to Surrey in 1694 , Russian Tsar Peter the Great studied shipbuilding for three months in 1698 . He and some of his fellow Russians stayed at Sayes Court , the manor house of Deptford . Evelyn was angered at the antics of the Tsar , who got drunk with his friends and , using a wheelbarrow with Peter in it , rammed their way through a fine holly hedge . Sayes Court was demolished in 1728 @-@ 9 and a workhouse built on its site . Part of the estates around Sayes Court were purchased in 1742 for the building of the Admiralty Victualling Yard , renamed the Royal Victoria Yard in 1858 after a visit by Queen Victoria . This massive facility included warehouses , a bakery , a <unk> / abattoir and sugar stores , and closed in 1960 . All that remains is the name of Sayes Court Park , accessed from Sayes Court Street off Evelyn Street , not far from Deptford High Street . The Pepys Estate , opened on 13 July 1966 , is on the former grounds of the Royal Victoria Dockyard . 
 The Docks had been gradually declining from the 18th century ; the larger ships being built found The Thames difficult to navigate , and Deptford was under competition from the new docks at Plymouth , Portsmouth and Chatham . When the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 the need for a Docks to build and repair warships declined ; the Docks shifted from shipbuilding to concentrate on victualling at the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard , and the Royal Dock closed in 1869 . From 1871 until the First World War the shipyard site was the City of London Corporation 's Foreign Cattle Market , in which girls and women butchered sheep and cattle until the early part of the 20th century . At its peak , around 1907 , over 234 @,@ 000 animals were imported annually through the market , but by 1912 these figures had declined to less than 40 @,@ 000 a year . The yard was taken over by the War Office in 1914 , and was an Army Supply Reserve Depot in the First and Second World Wars . The site lay unused until being purchased by Convoys ( newsprint importers ) in 1984 , and eventually came into the ownership of News International . In the mid @-@ 1990s , although significant investment was made on the site , it became uneconomic to continue using it as a freight wharf . In 2008 Hutchison Whampoa bought the <unk> site from News International with plans for a £ <unk> 3 @,@ 500 @-@ home development scheme . The Grade II listed Olympia Warehouse will be refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site . 
 Deptford experienced economic decline in the 20th century with the closing of the docks , and the damage caused by the bombing during the Second World War - a V @-@ 2 rocket destroyed a Woolworths store outside Deptford Town Hall , killing 160 people . High unemployment caused some of the population to move away as the riverside industries closed down in the late 1960s and early 1970s . The local council have developed plans with private companies to regenerate the riverside area , and the town centre . 
 = = Governance = = 
 The Manor of Deptford or West Greenwich was bestowed by William the Conqueror upon Gilbert de <unk> or <unk> , bishop of Lisieux , one of the eight barons associated with John de Fiennes for the defence of Dover Castle . <unk> held the head of his barony at Deptford and according to John Lyon writing in 1814 , he built himself a castle , or castellated mansion at Deptford , of which all traces had by then long since been buried in their ruins , but from the remains of some ancient foundations which had been discovered the site was probably on the brow of Broomfield , near the Mast Dock and adjacent to Sayes Court . 
 Originally under the governance of the ancient parishes of St Paul and St Nicholas , in 1900 , a Metropolitan Borough of Deptford was formed out of the southern parish of St Paul , with St Nicholas and the area around the Royal Dockyard coming under the governance of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich . Under the London Government Act 1963 , the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford was absorbed in 1965 into the newly created London Borough of Lewisham , with the area around the Royal Dockyard being transferred to Lewisham in a 1994 boundary adjustment of about 40 hectares ( 99 acres ) . The electoral wards consist of Evelyn in the north and part of New Cross to the south . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Deptford borders the areas of Brockley and Lewisham to the south , New Cross to the west and Rotherhithe to the north west ; Deptford Creek divides it from Greenwich to the east , and the River Thames separates the area from the Isle of Dogs to the north east ; it is contained within the London <unk> post code area . The area referred to as North Deptford is the only part of the London Borough of Lewisham to front the Thames and is sandwiched between Rotherhithe and Greenwich . Much of this riverside estate is populated by the former Naval Dockyards , now known as Convoys Wharf , the Pepys Estate and some eastern fringes of the old Surrey Commercial Docks . 
 The name Deptford — anciently written <unk> meaning " deep ford " — is derived from the place where the road from London to Dover , the ancient Watling Street ( now the A2 ) , crosses the River Ravensbourne at the site of what became Deptford Bridge at Deptford Broadway . The Ravensbourne crosses under the A2 at roughly the same spot as the DLR crosses over ; and at the point where it becomes tidal , just after Lewisham College , it is known as Deptford Creek , and flows into the River Thames at Greenwich Reach . 
 Deptford was mostly located in the Blackheath Hundred of the county of Kent , with the <unk> part in Surrey . It was regarded as two parts and in 1730 was divided into the two parishes of St Nicholas in the north and St Paul in the south . The southern part by the ford was known as Deptford and the northern , riverside area was known as Deptford Strand . It was also referred to as West Greenwich , with the modern town of Greenwich being referred to as East Greenwich until this use declined in the 19th century . The whole of Deptford came within the Metropolitan Police District in 1830 and was included in the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855 . It was transferred to the County of London in 1889 and became part of Greater London in 1965 . 
 The area was split in 1900 : the southern part , the parish of St Paul Deptford , became the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford ; while the northern part , the parish of St Nicholas Deptford , became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich . In 1965 the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford was absorbed into the London Borough of Lewisham , then in 1994 the bulk of the northern part , including the former Royal Dockyard area , was transferred to Lewisham Borough from Greenwich Borough , leaving only the north eastern area , around St Nicholas 's church , in Greenwich . 
 = = Demography = = 
 Deptford 's population has been mainly associated with the docks since the establishment of the Royal Docks by Henry VIII , though there has also been some market gardening and potteries . When the docks were thriving as the main administrative centre of the British Navy , so the area prospered , and fine houses were built for the administrative staff and the skilled shipbuilders , and a few grand houses like Sayes Court and Stone House on Lewisham Way were erected . There was a start of a demographic shift downwards when the Royal Navy pulled out of Deptford , and the docks moved into storage and freight . The downward shift continued into the 20th century as the local population 's dependency on the docks continued : as the docks themselves declined , so did the economic fortune of the inhabitants until the last dock , Convoys Wharf , closed in 2000 . 
 Deptford 's northern section nearest the old docks contains areas of desolate council housing and deprivation typical of inner city poverty , though the area , along with neighbouring New Cross , has been touted as " the new Shoreditch " by some journalists and estate agents paying attention to a trendy arts and music scene that is popular with students and artists . To the south where Deptford rolls into the suburban spread of Brockley , the previously multi @-@ occupancy Victorian houses are being gentrified by young city workers and urban professionals . Deptford has a growing Vietnamese community reflected in the number of restaurants in the area . 
 Deptford contains a number of student populations , including those of Goldsmiths College , the University of Greenwich , Bellerbys College and Laban Dance Centre . Goldsmiths College 's hall of residence , Rachel McMillan , in Creek Road was sold in 2001 for £ 79 million , and was subsequently demolished and replaced with the McMillan Student Village which opened in 2003 and provides accommodation for approximately 970 students of the University of Greenwich , Trinity Laban and Bellerbys colleges . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Deptford 's economic history has been strongly connected to the Dockyard - when the Dockyard was thriving , so Deptford thrived ; with the docks now all closed , Deptford has declined economically . However , areas of Deptford are being gradually re @-@ developed and gentrified - and the local council has plans to regenerate the riverside and the town centre . A large former industrial site by the Thames called Convoys Wharf is scheduled for redeveloping into mixed use buildings . This will involve the construction of around 3 @,@ 500 new homes and an extension of the town centre northwards towards the river . 
 Much of the area along Creek Road , close to Greenwich , has also been redeveloped , with the demolition of the old Deptford Power Station and Rose Bruford College buildings . Aragon Tower on the Pepys Estate was sold by Lewisham Borough to fund regeneration plans for the estate ; the award winning refurbishment into privately owned accommodation was featured in the BBC1 documentary , " The Tower " . 
 Deptford Market , a street market in Deptford High Street sells a range of goods , and is considered one of London 's liveliest street markets . In February 2005 , the High Street was described as " the capital 's most diverse and vibrant high street " by Yellow Pages business directory , using a unique mathematical formula . 
 = = Culture = = 
 The Albany Theatre , a community arts centre with a tradition of " radical community arts and music " including holding 15 " Rock Against Racism " concerts , has its roots in a charity established in 1894 to improve the social life of Deptford 's deprived community . The original building , the Albany Institute , was opened in 1899 on Creek Road , changing its name in the 1960s to the Albany Empire . It was burnt down in 1978 , but rebuilt on Douglas Way , with Prince Charles laying the foundation stone , and Diana , Princess of Wales opening it in 1982 . Creekside , a regeneration area beside Deptford Creek , is used for educational and artistic purposes , such as the Laban Dance Centre , which was designed by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de <unk> , and opened in February 2003 ; and the Art in Perpetuity Trust ( APT ) gallery and studio space .

 = Danielle Jones ( EastEnders ) = 
 Danielle Jones is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders , played by Lauren Crace . The character appeared between 18 August 2008 and 3 April 2009 . Crace 's casting in the role was announced in July 2008 , when she was described as a love interest for fellow new character Callum Monks ( Elliott Jordan ) . In October 2008 , it was revealed that Danielle was actually the long @-@ lost daughter of established character Ronnie Mitchell ( Samantha Womack ) . Crace has disclosed that even she was unaware of this fact upon being cast in the role , but always knew Danielle would only have a short arc . Danielle 's feelings were further explored in a segment of the BBC EastEnders homepage entitled Danielle 's Diary , documenting the character 's thoughts on the storylines she was involved in , while a special episode of EastEnders Revealed entitled " The Secret Mitchell " further explored the character 's impact on the show . 
 Danielle 's storylines focused on her friendship with local resident Stacey Slater ( Lacey Turner ) , her crush on Callum , and her adoption secret . She was deemed a welcome addition to the soap by members of the Telford local council , for raising awareness of the town the character originates from , however was poorly received by The Guardian 's Gareth McLean and Grace Dent , and dubbed " Drippy Danielle " by the Daily Mirror 's Jane Simon . Her final episode was watched by 11 @.@ 46 million viewers , and caused a notable power surge on the National Grid . 
 = = Storylines = = 
 Danielle arrives in Walford , having left her hometown of Telford and is befriended by local resident Stacey Slater ( Lacey Turner ) , who gives her a job on her market clothing stall and offers her the spare room in her family 's home . Danielle quickly develops a crush on fellow stall @-@ trader Callum Monks ( Elliott Jordan ) , who leads her on in an attempt to make Stacey jealous but he helps her get a second job , cleaning at The Queen Victoria public house , where she gets caught in the feud between Ronnie ( Samantha Janus ) and Archie Mitchell ( Larry Lamb ) . Both try to use Danielle to get information from the other , with Archie persuading Danielle to steal Ronnie 's post . Ronnie is furious when she realises and sacks Danielle after publicly berating her . Danielle is devastated , and is later seen clutching a locket containing a photograph of Ronnie , revealing herself to be Ronnie 's long @-@ lost daughter , Amy . 
 It transpires that Danielle is the result of a teenage romance between Ronnie and her first boyfriend , Joel Reynolds . Archie disapproved of the pregnancy and put Danielle - named Amy by Ronnie — up for adoption . Danielle was adopted by Lizzie and Andy Jones ( Aneirin Hughes ) . She began trying to locate her birth mother after Lizzie 's death in 2007 . Following Ronnie 's tirade , Danielle tries to leave Albert Square but Stacey and her family persuade her to stay with them . 
 Ronnie 's sister , Roxy ( Rita Simons , gives birth to a baby girl that she names Amy , to Danielle 's surprise . Ronnie 's dislike of her lessens with time , and when Danielle falls out with Stacey and ends up squatting in a flat owned by landlord Ian Beale ( Adam Woodyatt ) , Ronnie convinces him not to call the police . 
 Danielle later breaks down and tells Ronnie that she is pregnant by Paul , a barman she had a one night stand with . She intended to tell him about her pregnancy until he reveals he has a girlfriend . Ronnie comforts Danielle and contacts Andy , suggesting that he take Danielle home but she resists in favour of staying close to Ronnie . She is dismayed when Ronnie confides in her that having her own child was the biggest mistake of her life . Danielle makes up with Stacey and decides to terminate her pregnancy .

Following her abortion , Danielle visits her family for a while , but soon comes to miss Ronnie and Stacey and returns to Walford . Danielle becomes increasingly angry with Ronnie for rejecting her . She decides that she will tell Ronnie who she really is and leave Walford for good but Archie stops her when he learns who she is .

 = = Creation and characterisation = = 
 On 19 July 2008 , The Sun reported that a new character , Danielle , would be introduced to EastEnders as the love interest of fellow newcomer Callum Monks . Nineteen @-@ year @-@ old Danielle was described as a " naive blonde [ ... ] easily taken in by Callum 's smooth patter " , arriving in Walford with " just a suitcase and a dream of a new life " . It was later revealed that Danielle had additionally been created as the long @-@ lost daughter of established character Ronnie Mitchell , and a member of the soap 's long @-@ running Mitchell family . Her introduction had been planned from 2007 , when story producer Dominic Treadwell @-@ Collins conceived the idea of two new Mitchell sisters , Ronnie and Roxy . Ronnie was depicted as the more detached and icy sister , and a hidden secret was first alluded to eight months after their introduction , when Roxy made a veiled reference to Ronnie 's child and a physical fight ensued . Several months later , off @-@ set episodes shot in Weymouth and dubbed " Mitchell Week " by the BBC were aired , during which the audience were introduced to Ronnie and Roxy 's father Archie , and learned that Ronnie had given a child up for adoption . 
 Treadwell @-@ Collins explained that it was necessary to introduce Danielle shortly after this revelation , but in such a manner that she would arrive " under the audience 's radar " , to preserve the later revelation of her identity as Ronnie 's daughter . Lauren Crace , then a third year student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , was cast as Danielle and began filming in June 2008 . EastEnders was Crace 's first professional acting role , and executive producer Diederick Santer expressed his pleasure that Crace had chosen to make her debut on the show . Upon her introduction , EastEnders 's producers attempted to deceive the audience into believing Danielle was nothing more than a new friend for Stacey . Crace herself was only told of Danielle 's true identity after her successful audition , though as she only signed a six @-@ month contract with the show , was always aware Danielle would only have a short arc . She stated that some audience members guessed Danielle to be Ronnie 's daughter almost as soon as she arrived , and that she found maintaining the secret difficult . 
 Crace initially portrayed Danielle as being shy and afraid of rejection , though felt that Stacey 's friendship and living with the Slater family could have a positive impact on her confidence . Discussing her failure at romantic relationships , Crace assessed that Danielle 's eagerness may scare men off . She came to find portraying Danielle depressing , explaining that she was bored by and had doubts about Danielle 's constant naivety and passive personality . She suggested to the producers that Danielle should stand up for herself more , which was accepted and adapted into her personality , to the point that by the end of her tenure on the show , Danielle was " not a little mouse any more " . Crace 's view is that Danielle 's Mitchell heritage manifested itself in an inner @-@ strength and ability to " come back fighting " , giving her a toughness beneath her " wet and pathetic " personality . 
 = = Development = = 
 Series writer Simon Ashdown explained that Danielle initially chose to conceal her identity from Ronnie due to her fear of being rejected . He described her as " hurt and broken by her life " , and hoping to charm Ronnie into liking her before revealing the truth . Crace observed that Danielle was intrigued by Ronnie and the Mitchells , but also worried that she was too different from them and may be a disappointment to Ronnie . Danielle 's pregnancy was used as a plot @-@ device to bring the two closer together . Crace deemed the development " a huge thing " for Danielle , as contrary to her constant rejection , the one person she most desired support from was finally showing her affection . However , Ronnie 's failure to attend Danielle 's second clinic appointment signified " a step back " for the character , leaving her " hurt and distraught " and less willing to confide the truth in Ronnie than ever . 
 In the aftermath of her abortion , Danielle was depicted as being increasingly emotionally unstable and angry with Ronnie , believing that she deserved to belong to the Mitchell family . The writers had Archie discover her secret as a test of his character , experimenting with whether he would be despicable enough to conceal the truth . Lamb deemed Danielle " a huge threat " to Archie 's position as patriarch of the Mitchell family , explaining why he chose to lie that Ronnie was suffering from depression and Danielle ought not tell her . Danielle accepted the lie , believing it to explain Ronnie 's " hot and cold " reaction to her , and attempted to care for Ronnie and help her recover . Crace explained that despite their turbulent relationship , Ronnie was all Danielle had ever wanted . Despite seeing Archie as " a domineering figure " , Danielle initially trusted him and believed he would reunite her with her mother when the time was right . However , as time passed she became aware of Archie 's " true colours " and grew afraid of him . 
 The ultimate revelation of Danielle 's identity was set at Archie 's wedding to Peggy ( Barbara Windsor ) , matriarch of the Mitchell family . Crace deemed the wedding " the perfect opportunity " for the storyline to conclude , and Santer explained : " Weddings are great because they bring the community together . A wedding gives you a stage , it gives you an event , the context to play things out , so it felt right that these big Mitchell stories would collide at Peggy 's wedding . " Writer James Payne concurred that setting the reveal at the wedding helped to make the moment " as dramatic and sensational " as it could possibly be . The episode saw Danielle announce that she was Ronnie 's daughter in front of the entire wedding reception party , in what Crace has named her favourite scene on the show . She opined that the disbelief Danielle was faced with was " heartbreaking " and served to highlight the fact that " she came as the outsider and she still is the outsider because no one steps in to help her " . 
 Danielle was killed off minutes after revealing her true identity to Ronnie , dying in her mother 's arms . Although different outcomes to the storyline were considered , Santer explained that Danielle dying best preserved Ronnie 's status as EastEnders ' " tragic heroine character " . Treadwell @-@ Collins felt that to allow Ronnie to have her daughter , the " one thing that is key to her character " would serve to progressively weaken her character , and Santer agreed that while it may initially be touching , ultimately the relationship would become boring . The scene in which Danielle dies was filmed during winter , but as it was set in early April , snow had to be cleared away from the set before filming could commence . A body double was used for the moment Danielle was run over . Although sad to leave , Crace felt that the story 's conclusion was the right one , and was glad that Ronnie and Danielle finally shared a brief moment in the end , explaining : " It was so important that that tender moment was finally found , because that 's all people wanted . It 's all Danielle wanted , and it 's all Ronnie wants . " Crace concluded : " I think Danielle will leave quite a big mark on the Square and on the people in the Square – probably a bigger mark than she did when she was alive . 
 News of Danielle 's death was subject to a media embargo , although several newspapers and magazines including the Radio Times leaked news of Crace 's exit in advance of the event . Digital Spy 's Kris Green reported that most of the online EastEnders community had anticipated the character 's exit from the soap beforehand , some as early as January 2009 . 
 = = Related media = = 
 The BBC used viral promotion on the EastEnders homepage to further develop the character of Danielle . A new section named Danielle 's Diary was launched , encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards , written in diary style from Danielle 's point of view . Insight was given into the character 's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week , beginning with the introduction : " Bit new to all this . Need some way to clear my head though . Can 't really talk to Stace . Or Callum . Or anyone . Maybe if I write it all down , my head won 't explode ... Anyway , welcome to my life in Walford . " 
 In this manner , viewers were able to keep up with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009 , when she returned home to Telford following her abortion : " Back in Dawley . Feels strange to be away from Stacey ... away from R & R ... away from Ronnie . Been sleeping a lot – so tired . When I was younger I never dreamt that I ’ d go through all of this . Stace keeps ringing , but I can ’ t speak to anyone . I can ’ t even listen to my voicemail " , and were privy to Danielle 's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie : " It 's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself , as she actually admitted that she cared . For about ten seconds I felt close to her again . Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud ... feeling the warmth across your skin again . But , then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it . " The final entry , dated minutes before Danielle 's on @-@ screen death , reads : " All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes . To call me her baby . To tell me she loved me . I have to leave now . I have to go back to Telford . Goodbye Walford . " After the character had been killed off , the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages , supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters , including Abi Branning ( Lorna Fitzgerald ) , Lucy Beale ( Melissa Suffield ) , Callum and Stacey .

 Miles Hosken , a former mayor of Telford , welcomed the choice to give Danielle a Telford background due to the national exposure it gave the area . Sarah Raper , chief executive of economic development company Transforming Telford , commented : " We hope the new character will portray Telford in a positive light and increase national awareness of the town " , and Councillor Eric Carter , Telford & Wrekin Council cabinet member for regeneration , adding : " There are a lot of people working to put Telford on the map and this will help " . 
 The Daily Mirror sympathised with Danielle over the storyline which saw her manipulated by Archie , deeming it one of the more interesting EastEnders plot strands . Gareth McLean of The Guardian 's described Danielle as a " wet weekend incarnate " , criticising the drawn out nature of the secret Mitchell storyline . Fellow Guardian critic Grace Dent was similarly critical of the storyline , particularly the scripting . The Daily Mirror 's Tony Stewart wrote that " when a downcast Danielle walks into a room , it 's like all the lights have been switched off " , and his colleague Jane Simon christened the character " Drippy Danielle " , writing that " If she 's half Mitchell , her father must have been a marshmallow . " 
 Discussing the character 's death , Digital Spy 's Kris Green praised Crace 's acting . He compared Danielle 's revelation that Ronnie was her mother to the EastEnders storyline several years previously , when Kat Slater ( Jessie Wallace ) revealed she was actually the mother of her supposed sister Zoe ( Michelle Ryan ) . Green opined : " Although it didn 't quite capture the magic of [ the Kat @-@ Zoe scene ] it definitely comes an extremely close second . " He concluded : " I 'd probably go as far as to say that it 's one of the best episodes EastEnders has produced in a long time " . The episode was selected as recommended viewing by The Guardian 's Sarah Dempster . Simon called it " the EastEnders episode of the year " , though was again critical of Danielle , writing : " As a nation we 've been driven mad by Danielle screwing up her forehead , shrugging her shoulders and walking around like a wide eyed simpleton . She isn 't the first person in the world to track down their biological mother and while it 's seldom easy , I can 't imagine it 's ever been quite so hard as Danielle has made it . " Writing for The Times , Tim Teeman was critical of the length of time it took for the storyline to conclude , calling it " the most drawn @-@ out ' reveal ' in soapland " . He deemed Ashdown 's scripting of Danielle 's exit to be " mad crescendo after mad crescendo " , and the storyline as a whole " implausible " , concluding that by the time Danielle died in Ronnie 's arms : " EastEnders had hit the misery mother lode . " 
 Crace was pleased with public reaction to the mother @-@ daughter storyline , commenting prior to the reveal : " Everyone seems desperate to know why Danielle hasn 't told Ronnie yet , so I 'm taking that as a sign they 're enjoying the story . Viewers are always telling me that they love it when Danielle and Ronnie have a scene together – I think they 're on the edge of their seats , waiting to see when Danielle is finally going to admit the truth about her identity . " Danielle 's death received a mixed reaction from viewers , with 90 % of viewers polled by The Sun opining that killing Danielle off was a mistake . The decision was defended by Santer , who stated : " We acknowledge that we didn 't deliver the happy ending that many of the audience may have been hoping for , and that for some people this was upsetting . We hope viewers understand that our aim is to deliver the best drama . That doesn 't always lead to a happy ending . EastEnders – like all good drama – contains a balance of storylines , both happy and sad . We ’ re proud of the episode , the storyline which built up to it and the way the audience have engaged with it . " Following Danielle 's final episode , regulator Ofcom confirmed they had received a number of complaints from the public about the " violent nature of the show and the horrific death at the end " , and the fact it was broadcast before the 9 p.m. watershed . 
 Danielle 's final episode was watched by an average of 11 @.@ 46 million viewers , peaking at 11 @.@ 5 million during its broadcast , and attaining a 48 @.@ 3 % audience share . A further 1 @.@ 2 million viewers watched the episode 's repeat on BBC Three later that evening . The high ratings caused a power surge more than double the national average , seeing a grid surge of <unk> compared to the <unk> usually experienced during EastEnders episodes . A National Grid spokeswoman commented that the surge was " equivalent to around half a million kettles being switched on at once . " 
 = College Republicans = 
 The College Republican National Committee ( CRNC ) is a national organization for college and university students who support the Republican Party of the United States . The organization is known as an active recruiting tool for the Republican Party and has produced many prominent Republican and conservative activists and introduced more party members to the Republican party than any other organization in the nation . 
 The organizational structure of the College Republicans has changed significantly since its founding in 1892 . Originally founded as an organization for the Republican National Committee , the College Republicans now operate as an independent 527 group . After the Young Republican National Federation was spun off from the College Republicans organization in 1972 , the groups operate independent of one another .

 = = = Founding and early history = = = 
 The College Republicans were founded as the American Republican College League on May 17 , 1892 at the University of Michigan . The organization was spearheaded by law student James Francis Burke , who would later serve as a Congressman from Pennsylvania . The inaugural meeting was attended by over 1 @,@ 000 students from across the country , from Stanford University in the west to Harvard University in the east . Contemporary politicians also attended the meeting , including Judge John M. Thurston , Senator Russell A. Alger , Congressman J. Sloat Fassett , Congressman W. E. Mason , John M. Langston , and Abraham Lincoln 's successor in the Illinois State Legislature , A. J. Lester . Then @-@ Governor of Ohio William McKinley gave a rousing keynote speech . 
 The College Republicans quickly pursued a strategy of sending college students to vote in their home districts and registering others to vote where they schooled to swing closely contested districts . This strategy was successfully implemented for the 1900 presidential election between William McKinley and William Jennings Bryan , helping win Bryan 's home state of Nebraska for McKinley . 
 The College Republicans were financed , at least in part , by the Republican National Committee throughout much of its history . James Francis Burke received significant funding from the RNC to support the American Republican College League 's founding and to maintain the organization 's early offices in New York and Chicago . By 1924 , the organization was operating directly under the auspices of the RNC as the Associated University Republican Clubs . 
 The relative dominance of the Democratic party through the 1930s through the 1960s coincided with a precipitous drop in the membership and effectiveness of the College Republicans . In 1931 , the College Republicans were absorbed as an arm of the Hoover campaign . For the next several years the organization operated alternately under the auspices of the " Republican National League , " " Young Republican National Committee , " and the " Division of Young Republican Activities . " In 1935 , the College Republicans were merged into the newly created Young Republican National Federation , encompassing both college students and young professionals . College Republican operations continued under the Young Republicans until the 1965 founding of the " College Republican National Committee . " 
 = = = Modern history = = = 
 In 1967 , Morton Blackwell , then a field representative for the CRNC to Kentucky , developed many of the principles now used by the College Republicans . As the college organizer supporting Louie Nunn 's campaign for Governor of Kentucky , Blackwell organized approximately 5 @,@ 000 college student volunteers who dropped 93 @,@ 000 pieces of literature , posted 20 @,@ 000 flyers , mailed 15 @,@ 000 hand @-@ addressed and signed postcards to friends of known student supporters of Nunn , and processed over 8 @,@ 000 absentee ballots . On election day , Nunn became the first Republican Governor of Kentucky in 20 years . The New York Times and Louie Nunn himself credited the efforts of Blackwell 's volunteers . 
 In 1970 , the Young Republican National Federation was permanently spun off from the College Republicans in 1970 to prevent counter @-@ productive infighting among the two groups . In 1972 the Republican National Committee made the College Republican National Committee an auxiliary arm of the RNC . 
 In 1973 , Karl Rove ran for chair of the College Republicans . He challenged the front @-@ runner 's delegates , throwing the national convention into disarray , after which both he and his opponent , Robert Edgeworth , claimed victory . The dispute was resolved when Rove was selected through the direct order of the chairman of the Republican National Committee , who at the time was George H W Bush . 
 By 1980 , only 20 active College Republican chapters remained . By the US Presidential election in 1980 , that number had increased to 1 @,@ 000 active clubs , helping Reagan win 98 of 105 mock elections and recruiting thousands of voters . This success led to $ 290 @,@ 000 in financial assistance from the RNC , mainly to implement Jack Abramoff 's field representative program .

 Prompted by the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act , the CRNC officially left the control of the RNC by reconstituting as a 527 group , allowing it to operate independently and raise unlimited amount of money for issue @-@ advocacy work . As a 527 group , the organization is prohibited from coordinating directly with a particular campaign and its recent focus has turned towards developing volunteers and other support activities rather than outright campaigning . The shift has allowed the CRNC to vastly expand its fundraising efforts . During its first two years , the CRNC raised $ 17 @.@ 3 million , most going to pay fundraising costs and other administrative costs , while leaving more than $ 2 million to expand the field representative program and to improve pay for the full @-@ time positions . 
 The CRNC was criticized for its relationship with Response Dynamics , a Virginia @-@ based direct mail company . The relationship became an issue during the 2005 election for National Chairman , which was won by former CRNC Treasurer , Paul Gourley , whose signature was on the questionable fundraising letters . 
 Morgan Wilkins , a CRNC field representative for election 2006 was placed on probation by the CRNC after suggesting several controversial events might be held on the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor Campus , to that school 's student newspaper , the Michigan Daily . The events included , " Catch an Illegal Immigrant Day " and " Fun with Guns Day , " where students were to shoot cardboard cutouts of prominent Democrats . This incident ultimately became a major news story on several national media outlets . Several sources , including the Michigan Daily incorrectly identified Ms. Wilkins as an employee of the Republican National Committee , rather than the CRNC , eliciting an outcry from Democratic National Committee Chairman , Howard Dean . In return , GOP Chairman Ken Mehlman condemned Wilkins ' activities , as well as Governor Dean . Keith Olbermann named Wilkins his " Worst Person in the World . " She was suspended for the incident , and later fired by the CRNC for later creating a Facebook group in which she promised to make out with individuals who signed up volunteers for get out the vote efforts .

 There are 52 College Republican state federations , each administering the College Republican activities at the state level , in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , and in the District of Columbia . The state federation leadership team , which includes a state chairperson and other officers , serve as the primary link between local university chapters and the national College Republican National Committee . The state chairman serves as the representative for College Republicans when dealing with the state Republican Party , local media , and governmental entities . State federations are responsible for organizing and assisting local chapters with securing proper credentials , recruitment efforts , and campus voter canvasses .

 The CRNC organizes election @-@ year field representative programs to send paid staffers to recruit and train students and chapters nationwide . Former national chair Jack Abramoff founded the field representative program in 1981 . The program faltered during the 1980s and was revived during the late 1990s . 
 During the election season , campus chapters are responsible for organizing and implementing the campus canvas , running mock elections , managing the local get @-@ out @-@ the @-@ vote efforts . At other times , the campus chapters will organize issue advocacy and lobbying efforts , welcome conservative guest speakers to campus , and organize social events and other recruitment activities . 
 During the election season , the CRNC focuses on developing a " mass based youth effort " directed toward electing Republican candidates . The CRNC often sends paid field representatives to individual campuses to assist in organizing the election efforts . Generally the hired field representative or chapter chair begins the school year with membership tables on campus for recruitment . Members use door @-@ to @-@ door canvassing and word of mouth to identify and register as many Republican voters among the student body as possible . These individuals are encouraged to vote through an absentee ballot and assist the candidates with election day Get Out The Vote efforts . Chapters occasionally run student mock elections and other special events as a means to gain positive earned media attention for a candidate .

 = Pycnoporellus alboluteus = 
 Pycnoporellus alboluteus , commonly known as the orange sponge polypore , is a species of polypore fungus in the family <unk> . Distributed throughout the boreal conifer zone , the fungus is found in mountainous regions of western North America , and in Europe . It causes a brown cubical rot of conifer wood , especially spruce , but also fir and poplar . The soft , spongy orange fruit bodies grow spread out on the surface of fallen logs . Mature specimens have tooth @-@ like or jagged pore edges . A snowbank mushroom , P. alboluteus can often be found growing on logs or stumps protruding through melting snow . Although the edibility of the fungus and its usage for human culinary purposes are unknown , several species of beetles use the fungus as a food source . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was originally described as Fomes alboluteus by Job Bicknell Ellis and Benjamin Matlack Everhart in 1895 . Collected by botanist Charles Spencer Crandall , the type specimens were found growing on the charred trunks of Abies <unk> in the mountains of Colorado , at an elevation of 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) . In its taxonomic history , it has been transferred to several genera . The original authors moved it to Polyporus in 1898 , considering it allied to Polyporus <unk> . They also noted that the pores developed teeth @-@ like elongations like those of genus <unk> . Other generic transfers include <unk> by Otto Kuntze in the same year , <unk> by William Alphonso Murrill in 1895 , <unk> by Murrill in 1905 , Phaeolus by Albert Pilát in 1937 , and Hapalopilus by <unk> <unk> Bondartsev and Rolf Singer in 1943 . It was given its current name in 1963 when Czech mycologists František <unk> and Zdeněk Pouzar placed it in Pycnoporellus . 
 The generic name Pycnoporellus is Ancient Greek for " with countless pores " . The specific epithet alboluteus is a combination of the Latin words for " white " and " yellow " . Curtis Gates Lloyd did not approve of the name , opining : " I hardly see how Ellis could have given it a worse name if he had tried , for it is neither " white " nor " yellow " , but orange as Ellis described it . The young growth may possibly be white , but not when developed . " The fungus is commonly known as the " orange sponge polypore " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies of P. alboluteus are annual , and are resupinate ; they can be spread out on the substrate surface for up to 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . Fresh fruit bodies are bright orange , finely grooved , and have a soft and spongy upper surface . The pore surface is orange with angular pores that are usually larger than 1 mm in diameter . It features thin partitions that split to form a teeth @-@ like layer . The flesh is soft and pale orange , up to 2 mm thick , with a felt @-@ like texture . The tubes are the same color as the pores , and continuous with the flesh , measuring up to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) thick . Bruised pores sometimes turn black . All tissues of the fungus turn bright red if a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide is applied . Fresh fruit bodies retain considerable moisture and can be squeezed of liquid like a sponge . The fruit body can be readily removed in large sheets from the wood it grows on . The edibility of the fruit body is unknown . It has a fragrant odor . 
 In deposit , the spores are white . Spores are cylindrical , smooth , hyaline ( translucent ) , inamyloid , and measure 9 – 12 by 3 – 3 @.@ 5 µm . Pycnoporellus alboluteus has a monomitic hyphal system , meaning it is made of generative hyphae , which are thin @-@ walled , branched , and narrow . Hyphae in the flesh layer are <unk> to thick @-@ walled , frequently branched , and measure 2 – 10 µm in diameter , while those of the pores are roughly similar in morphology , but measure 3 – 5 µm . Both forms have a thin <unk> on their walls that gives them a rough appearance when viewed with a light microscope . The hymenium ( spore @-@ bearing tissue layer ) is 40 – 60 µm thick , and has abundant cystidia , which are hyaline , and measure 7 – 9 µm in diameter . They are cylindrical , thin @-@ walled to moderately thick @-@ walled , hyaline , have a septum at the base , and measure 60 – 120 by 5 – 10 µm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and have dimensions of 25 – 35 by 6 – 7 µm . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Field characteristics used to identify Pycnoporellus alboluteus include its orange color , toothlike pore edges , and the soft texture of its flesh . Other reddish @-@ colored polypores with which Pycnoporellus alboluteus can be confused include Polyporus alboluteus , P. fibrillosus , and P. cinnabarinus . They can be distinguished by the size of their pores : P. alboluteus has pores that measure 1 – 3 mm , those of P. fibrillosus are 1 – 2 per mm , while those of P. cinnabarinus are 2 – 4 per mm . The shelf @-@ like fruit bodies of Pycnoporellus fulgens have distinct caps , smaller pores measuring 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 5 mm , and less tendency to be pulled away from the substrate in sheets . <unk> <unk> is another snowbank fungus that prefers downed conifer logs . It can be distinguished from P. alboluteus by its whitish cottony upper surface . Another orange fungus , <unk> <unk> , is tightly appressed to the wood substrate , with a soft , gelatinous body texture . 
 = = Ecology , habitat and distribution = = 
 Pycnoporellus alboluteus causes a brown cubical rot on fallen logs of coniferous trees . The fruit bodies usually grow on the underside of the log , and may start developing while still immersed in snow . Although new fruit bodies usually begin growing in the spring , they may persist throughout the year . In Europe , it usually grows on Picea species , but also on Abies . In North America , it also grows on Populus . The fungus has a circumpolar distribution , and is found in the boreal conifer zone , particularly in the montane zone , 8 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 400 – 3 @,@ 000 m ) . In North America , the fruit bodies begin growth under snow in the spring , continuing until midsummer , while in Europe , it is usually encountered in autumn . It is abundant in the Rocky Mountain region of North America , but rare in the eastern United States and Canada . As a timberline fungus subject to high altitudes , the fruit bodies are subjected to bright light , high winds , and low relative humidity , all of which have a drying effect . They counteract these extremes by absorbing water quickly , and drying slowly . 
 In Europe , it is one of 32 threatened species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention . It has been recorded from Czechoslovakia , and Poland , where it is mostly found in old @-@ growth forests . It is rare in northern Europe , where it has been found in Finland growing on Picea abies and Alnus incana , and in Sweden . 
 In North America , the fruit bodies of the fungus serve as a food source for the rove beetle species <unk> castaneum , the pleasing fungus beetle species <unk> <unk> , and minute tree @-@ fungus beetles , including <unk> laevis .

 = Southward expansion of the Han dynasty = 
 The southward expansion of the Han dynasty comprises a series of military campaigns and expeditions in what is now modern South China and Northern Vietnam . Military expansion to the south began under the previous Qin dynasty and continued during the Han . Campaigns were dispatched against the Yue tribes , leading to the annexation of Minyue by the Han in 135 BCE and 111 BCE , Nanyue in 111 BCE , and Dian in 109 BCE . 
 Chinese culture influenced the newly conquered territories , and merged with native traditions . Han influences are apparent in artifacts excavated in the Baiyue tombs of southern China . This influence extended to the kingdoms of Southeast Asian , where contact led to trade and diplomacy . The demand for Chinese silk established trade routes between Europe , the Middle East , and China . 
 = = Background = = 
 Military campaigns against the Baiyue began under the Qin , the dynasty that preceded the Han . The Qin emperor Qin Shi Huang desired the resources of the Baiyue , and ordered military expeditions against the region between 221 BC and 214 BC . He sent a large campaign against Lingnan in 214 BC , comprising conscripted merchants and soldiers . Military garrisons were installed in Lingnan , canals were constructed , and the area was placed under Qin rule . The collapse of the Qin caused the dissolution of Qin administration in southern China . Indigenous Yue kingdoms emerged in the former Qin territories , including the Nanyue kingdom in Guangxi , Guangdong , and Vietnam , Minyue in Fujian , and Eastern Ou in Zhejiang . 
 Supported by the Han , Minyue was established in 202 BC and Eastern Ou in 192 BC after the fall of the Qin dynasty . Zhao Tuo , a former Chinese commander of the Qin , established Nanyue in 208 BC after the death of the emperor Qin Shi Huang . Emperor Gaozu , first emperor of the Han dynasty , approved Zhao Tuo 's new title as king . Zhao was born in the city of <unk> in Central China , and the ruling class of the new kingdom was composed of Chinese officials from the former Qin dynasty . In 180 BC , Zhao offered to submit as a vassal state and the Han accepted , a decision partly based on his family 's northern Chinese ancestry . 
 = = Military campaigns = = 
 = = = Campaigns against Minyue and Eastern Ou = = = 
 Military campaigns were launched against the Baiyue under the reign of the Han emperor Han Wudi . Eastern Ou requested Han military assistance when Minyue invaded the kingdom in 138 BC . Supreme commander Tian Fen opposed Han intervention . Tian told the emperor that the Yue tribes could not be trusted . Battles between the Yue tribes occurred frequently , and Tian believed that protecting them was not a responsibility of the Han court . The Han official Zhuang Zhu convinced the emperor to intervene in the war . Zhuang 's argument was based on the emperor 's role as the Son of Heaven , a concept in Chinese political philosophy . In Sima Qian 's Records of the Grand Historian , Zhuang is reported to have said : 
 The only thing we should worry about is whether we have strength enough to rescue them and virtue enough to command their loyalty ... Now a small country has come to report its distress to the Son of Heaven . If he does not save it , to whom can it turn for aid ? And how can the Son of Heaven claim that the rulers of all other states are like sons to him if he ignores their pleases ? 
 The Minyue surrendered after a Han naval force led by Zhuang Zhu was dispatched from Shaoxing in northern Zhejiang , and withdrew from Eastern Ou . The Yue tribes of Eastern Ou were transferred to the north , between the Yangtze River and Huai River . 
 A second intervention was launched in 135 BC after Minyue , ruled by Zou Ying , invaded Nanyue , ruled by Zhao Mo . Nanyue had been a Han vassal since 180 BC . Zhao asked the Han for their support , and the emperor responded by sending an army led by Wang Hui and Han Anguo against Minyue . 
 Zou Ying was assassinated with a spear by his younger brother Zou Yushan , who plotted against the ruler with the royal family and prime minister . Ying beheaded the corpse and gave the head to a messenger , who delivered it to Wang as a sign of Minyue 's surrender . After the assassination , Minyue was succeeded by a state divided into a dual monarchy composed of the kingdom of Minyue , controlled by a Han proxy ruler , and the kingdom of Dongyue , ruled by Zou Yushan . 
 As general Yang Pu returned north with his soldiers after the Han – Nanyue War in 111 BC , he requested the emperor 's permission to annex Dongyue . The emperor refused after he considered the morale of the troops . Zou Yushan had promised to supply an army to assist the Han in their war against the Nanyue . The army never arrived and Zou blamed the weather conditions , while secretly maintaining a diplomatic relationship with Nanyue . 
 Zou began a rebellion against the Han after learning of Yang 's plot against him . A Han military campaign was dispatched and led by General Han Yue , General Yang Pu , military commander Wang Wenshu , and two marquises of Yue ancestry . The revolt was repressed and the Han annexed Dongyue in the last months of 111 BC , conquering the remaining territory of the former Minyue . Sima Qian records that the entire population of Dongyue was exiled , a claim that is implausible . 
 = = = Campaign against Nanyue = = = 
 In the 110s BC , <unk> ( <unk> ) , the empress dowager of Nanyue , wife of the deceased Zhao <unk> and a Chinese native , mooted the unification of Nanyue with Han China . This proposal was met with resistance in the Nanyue nobility which , although nominally tributary to the Han , had not paid tribute in years . The queen was executed by Lü Jia , leader of those who had opposed her , in the summer of 112 BC . 
 The Han dynasty took umbrage at the diplomats killed with her and saw this event as an act of rebellion . Emperor Wu sent a military campaign consisting of 2 @,@ 000 soldiers led by General Han <unk> to quell the revolt . The general died in battle and the Han forces lost . The second campaign , led by the generals Lu Bode and Yang Pu , was dispatched by sea with 100 @,@ 000 soldiers in the fall of 112 BC . They reached the city of Panyu , located in modern Guangzhou , in 111 – 110 BC and defeated the rebels . 
 Lingnan was once again brought under Chinese control , and nine Chinese commanderies were created to administer Guangdong , the island of Hainan , and the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam . The two Han commanderies located in Hainan were abandoned in 82 BC and 46 BC , despite the Han government 's interest in the area 's rare resources . 
 In the early years of the Eastern Han , following the usurpation of Wang Mang and the re @-@ establishment of the Han , the tribal elites of Nanyue remained loyal to the Han . In 40 , revolts against Han rule were led by the Trung sisters near the Red River Delta . The rebellion was defeated in 43 by the general Ma Yuan , a participant in the battles that followed Wang Mang 's usurpation . 
 The Han reestablished control of Nanyue . The Trung sisters were executed or killed during the fighting . In popular accounts , they vanished in the sky , fell sick , or took their own lives by jumping into a river and drowning . Violence in the region continued , and there were seven periods of unrest between 100 and 184 . A new strategy was adopted , orchestrated by the official Li Gu , that sought to appoint honest officials , exile hostile tribes , and pit tribal leaders against each other . The strategy was only partially successful . 
 = = = Campaign against Dian = = = 
 In 135 BC , Tang Meng led the earliest Han expedition against Dian , establishing the <unk> commandery in southwestern China . Dian was involved in the trade of livestock , horses , fruit , and slaves , and was attractive to the Han because of its resources . Trade routes between Dian and the rest of the Han empire were opened up by Han soldiers . The Han continued their expansion northward , and annexed the territory near Shu . 
 Due to the Han – Xiongnu War on the north , the rising cost of administration in the distant state led to the Han abandoning the commandery . A group of Chinese explorers were captured by the Dian for four years . They were part of an expedition traveling southwards to establish an alternative trade route for the goods reported in Central Asian markets in 122 BCE . 
 Dian was conquered during a military campaign launched by Wudi in 109 BCE , and the <unk> commandery was established in the former kingdom . Archaeologists discovered the king of Dian 's imperial seal inscribed by the Han , confirming Dian 's surrender and status as a subject of the Han . The Dian led a series of unsuccessful rebellions against Han rule , beginning with two revolts in 86 BCE and 83 BCE . Chen Li , governor of the <unk> commandery , crushed a rebellion in 28 – 35 BCE . Under Wang Mang 's reign as usurper of the Han throne between 9 @-@ 23 CE , hostilities in southwestern China persisted . Wang sent military campaigns to end the unrest . Seventy percent of the soldiers in one campaign died from illness . Another campaign , comprising 100 @,@ 000 men and with double the supplies , was not fruitful . Rebellions continued in 42 @-@ 45 and 176 . 
 The Han expanded further during Emperor Ming 's reign ( 57 – 75 CE ) . The new commandery of <unk> ( <unk> ) was established in what is modern <unk> , Yunnan in the former Dian Kingdom . The tribes west of the <unk> commandery ( <unk> , modern <unk> in southern Sichuan ) submitted to Han rule in 114 CE . Emperor Huang ( r . 146 @-@ 168 ) encouraged the cultural assimilation of the tribes during his reign between . Under <unk> , the teaching of Chinese ethics and culture was promoted in Yunnan . Despite periodic unrest , Han presence remained in the Dian for the remainder of the dynasty . 
 = = Historical significance = = 
 = = = Chinese migration and cultural assimilation = = = 
 Migrations from northern China populated Yunnan , Guangdong , and northern Vietnam . The political turmoil that followed Wang Mang 's usurpation led to another wave of Chinese migration . Han settlers and soldiers from the north were affected by diseases common in tropical regions , such as malaria and schistosomiasis . 
 The military campaigns and Chinese migrations created a culture that merged Chinese traditions with indigenous elements . Archaeological digs in the area reveal the extent of Chinese influence . Han dynasty tombs in Guangzhou , Guangdong show that the native tools and ceramics were gradually replaced by those modeled after Chinese styles by the Western Han . Excavations from the period have uncovered bronze mirrors , stoves , wells , incense burners , tripods , and lanterns manufactured in the style of the Han . 
 Cultural assimilation in Guangxi and Guizhou happened during the late Western Han and occurred later than in Guangdong . As in Guangdong , a number of Han @-@ style mirrors , coins , ceramics , bronze , iron , and lacquerware were discovered in the region 's tombs . 
 Yunnan in southwestern China was sinicized after the establishment of a Chinese prefecture in 109 BC . Cultural assimilation of the tribes through the teaching of Chinese ethics was supported under the reign of Qin Shi Huang . The growing influence of Chinese culture is apparent in excavated Dian artifacts , and coins , ceramics , mirrors , and bronzes have been discovered in Dian manufactured with Han stylistic elements . Dian art adopted the aesthetics of Han imports and by 100 , the indigenous Dian culture had largely disappeared . Northern Chinese culture had become largely ingrained in the south . The expansion of China from the North China Plain to the south , a process that began in the Qin dynasty , had reached its height under the Han . 
 = = = Trade and foreign contact = = = 
 The southward expansion of the Han dynasty brought the empire into contact with the civilizations of Southeast Asia . Chinese cultural and technological influence spread to nearby Southeast Asian kingdoms . Remnants of Chinese pottery from the Han dynasty have been excavated in Sumatra , Borneo , and Java and date from the 1st century . Archaeologists have also discovered bronze axes in Cambodia that were based on the design of Chinese axes . 
 Trade relationships were also formed between China and foreign empires through the conquered territories . Trade connected China with India , Persia , and the eastern Roman Empire . Roman dancers and entertainers were sent to Luoyang as a gift to China from a Burmese kingdom in 120 . A kingdom referred to in the Book of Han as <unk> delivered a rhinoceros in 2 as a tribute . An Indian embassy arrived in China between 89 and 105 . Roman merchants from the province of Syria visited Vietnam in 166 , Nanjing in 226 , and Luoyang in 284 . Foreign products have been found at archaeological sites excavating tombs in southern China . Originating with the overseas demand for Chinese silk , these trade routes were responsible for the transmission of goods and ideas between Europe , the Middle East , and China .

 Trenck 's Pandurs ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> , German : <unk> ) were a light infantry unit of the Habsburg Monarchy , raised by Baron Franz von der Trenck under a charter issued by Maria Theresa of Austria in 1741 . The unit was largely composed of volunteers from the Kingdom of Slavonia and Slavonian Military Frontier , and named after security guards otherwise employed to maintain public order . The Pandurs were presented to the empress in May 1741 — with the unit 's military band — earning them a claim of pioneering martial music in Europe . The Pandurs did not use uniforms and had an overall oriental / Ottoman appearance . The original organization of the unit was retained until 1745 , when it transformed into a regiment . Trenck was relieved of command in 1746 and imprisoned in Spielberg Castle , where he died in 1749 . The unit ultimately transformed into the 53rd Infantry Regiment , headquartered in Zagreb , until it was disbanded in 1919 . The regiment 's commemorative medals bear Trenck 's image wearing Pandur attire . 
 The Pandurs took part in the War of the Austrian Succession , including the First and Second Silesian War . They contributed to the capture or destruction of <unk> am Berge , <unk> , Klaus Castle , Linz , <unk> , <unk> Castle , Cham , Cosel fortress and Munich . During the Battle of <unk> , the unit looted a Prussian war chest and the belongings of Frederick the Great . They also took part in the Battle of Waterloo . In the Wellington museum in Waterloo , Belgium , their motto Vivat Pandur can be read , on a sword found on the battlefield . The Pandurs earned a reputation as brave , audacious , feared and ruthless soldiers , known for looting and pillaging . They were prone to disobedience , breaches of military discipline and stubbornness . The city of Waldmünchen , located near Cham , celebrates the Pandurs and Trenck as the city 's saviors for sparing the city from destruction in 1742 . The Pandurs ' and Trenck 's heritage is also preserved in the city of Požega , Croatia , where an eponymous living history troop and city music band exist . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The term <unk> made its way into military use via the Hungarian language — being used in Hungarian as a loanword , in turn originating from the Serbo @-@ Croatian term <unk> , though the nasal in place of the " u " suggests a borrowing before Serbo @-@ Croatian innovated its own reflex for Proto @-@ Slavic / ɔ ̃ / . " <unk> " is still applied to security guards protecting crops in vineyards and fields , and it was coined from the verb <unk> ( also spelled <unk> ) meaning to chase or scare away . The meaning of the Hungarian loanword was expanded to guards in general , including law enforcement officers . The word was likely ultimately derived from medieval Latin <unk> or <unk> , meaning either a guardian of fields or summoner , or follower of a banner . 
 By the middle of the 18th century , law enforcement in the counties of Croatia included county pandurs or hussars who patrolled roads and pursued criminals . In 1740 , the term was applied to frontier guard duty infantry deployed in the Croatian Military Frontier ( <unk> Frontier ) , specifically its Karlovac and Varaždin <unk> . The role of the pandurs as security guards was extended to Dalmatia after the establishment of Austrian rule there in the early 19th century . The term has dropped from official use for law enforcement officials , but it is still used colloquially in Croatia and the Western Balkans in a manner akin to the English word cop . The unit raised and led by Trenck is also referred to more specifically as Trenck 's Pandurs , and less frequently in Croatia than elsewhere , as Croatian Pandurs . 
 = = History = = 
 The Pandurs were a <unk> unit of the Habsburg Monarchy , raised by Baron Franz von der Trenck following a charter ( German : <unk> ) issued by Maria Theresa of Austria on 27 February 1741 , permitting Trenck to raise a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ strong troop . The unit was largely composed of men enlisted as volunteers from areas of the Kingdom of Slavonia and Slavonian Military Frontier , consisting of ethnic Croats and Serbs . The Pandurs saw military action in Silesia , Bohemia , Bavaria and France . 
 The Pandurs arrived in Vienna for a military parade for the empress on 27 May 1741 . The unit was headed by Trenck and included two captains , a senior lieutenant , five lieutenants , a quartermaster , an adjutant , two chaplains ( a Catholic and an Orthodox Christian ) , two medics , 40 sergeants , five scribes , 80 corporals and twelve musicians equipped with flutes , a drum and cymbals . The musicians were called the Turkish band , after Ottoman military bands , and are considered pioneers of martial music in Europe according to <unk> Miletić . The Pandurs did not have specific uniforms — their clothes varied but were of Turkish style . Their oriental appearance was compounded by mandatory head shaving , leaving a rattail , as well as by the use of a horse tail <unk> instead of a unit banner . Each Pandur carried four single @-@ shot pistols , a fighting knife and a small knife . 
 The Pandurs took part in War of the Austrian Succession , including the First Silesian War . They took part in capturing <unk> am Berge and <unk> in Lower Silesia from the Prussians , and defending a bridgehead near Vienna after the Battle of <unk> . In 1742 , the Pandurs took part in capture of Klaus Castle in Styria as well as Linz and <unk> , where they defeated French troops before taking part in Austrian recapture of Munich . By the end of that year , the Pandurs had captured <unk> Castle and Cham from Bavarian defenders , completely destroying Cham to secure access for Habsburg troops led by Ludwig Andreas von <unk> to Bohemia . In 1743 , the Pandurs led by Trenck captured Cosel fortress . In 1745 , during the Second Silesian War , the Pandurs took part in the Battle of <unk> , where they looted a Prussian war chest containing 80 @,@ 000 ducats , as well as weapons , horses and a tent belonging to Frederick the Great . 
 The Pandurs earned a reputation for being brave and audacious , as well as feared and ruthless soldiers , looting and pillaging , but also characterized by disobedience , breaches of military discipline and stubbornness . On the other hand , the City of Waldmünchen , located near Cham , celebrates the Pandurs and Trenck as their savior for sparing the city from destruction in 1742 . Since 1950 , the city organizes a historical reenactment of the event involving about 300 actors . 
 The original organization of the unit was retained until 1745 , when it was transformed into a Pandur regiment following Trenck 's petition to the empress . Trenck was relieved of command in 1746 and tried for unspecified " acts of violence " . He was imprisoned in Spielberg Castle , where he died in 1749 . After the Peace of Aachen , the regiment was transformed into a Slavonian battalion on 22 December 1748 . In 1756 , as the Seven Years ' War started , the battalion was reformed into the 53rd Infantry Regiment and its headquarters moved to Zagreb ending history of the Pandurs . Still , the regiment kept its Pandur lineage alive through its commemorative medals bearing Trenck 's image wearing Pandur attire . The regiment was disbanded in January 1919 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The achievements of the Pandurs led by Trenck left a lasting mark on the culture and heritage of Croatia as well as Bavaria . An example of the unit 's legacy is found in the village of <unk> — named after the commander of the Pandurs in 1912 . The village is located in area of Trenck 's former Velika estate , near Požega , Croatia , where the baron lived . It was the location of a baroque manor once owned by Trenck , which was replaced by another structure in the late 18th or early 19th centuries . Pandur heritage is preserved by the Trenck 's Pandurs ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> ) military band — the official music band of the city of Požega — established on 28 January 1881 . In 1997 , an eponymous living history troop was established out of members of the band . Also , a Trenck festival is held annually in Waldmünchen , commemorating the events of 1742 , when the city was spared by Trenck from destruction . 
 The military unit and its leader also give their names to a modern armed force unit and modern military equipment . Special police platoon <unk> , formed in Požega on 8 March 1991 , took part in the Croatian War of Independence . Steyr @-@ Daimler @-@ Puch produces the Pandur armoured fighting vehicle .

 Kingdom Hearts features a mixture of familiar Disney and Square Enix characters , as well as several new characters designed and created by Nomura . In addition to original locations , the Kingdom Hearts series features many worlds from Disney films . Sora must visit these worlds and interact with various Disney characters to protect them from enemies . Often , his actions in these worlds closely follow the storylines of their respective Disney films . The main characters try not to interfere with the affairs of other worlds , as it could negatively affect the universe 's order . Moogles , small creatures from the Final Fantasy series , are another common element in the games . They provide the player with a synthesis shop in order to create and purchase items used in the game . So far , twenty @-@ one characters from the Final Fantasy Series have appeared in the Kingdom Hearts games . The main cast from The World Ends with You also makes an appearance in the series as seen in Dream Drop Distance . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The series starts with Kingdom Hearts showing how a 14 @-@ year @-@ old boy named Sora is separated from his friends Riku and Kairi when their world , Destiny Islands , is invaded by creatures known as the Heartless . During the invasion , Sora obtains a weapon called the Keyblade that allows him to fight the Heartless . He soon arrives in another world , Traverse Town , where he meets Donald Duck and Goofy , two emissaries from Disney Castle sent by King Mickey to find the wielder of the Keyblade . The three band together and travel to different Disney @-@ themed worlds , sealing the hearts of the worlds to prevent more Heartless invasions , and to find Riku and Kairi . Along the way , they encounter a group of Disney villains led by Maleficent , who are controlling the Heartless to capture seven maidens called the " Princesses of Heart " , and use their power to open the door to " Kingdom Hearts " and rule over all the worlds . Though they eventually defeat Maleficent , the three discover that Ansem has been possessing Riku 's body and using Maleficent , and plans to attain eternal darkness by opening Kingdom Hearts himself . Sora , Donald and Goofy defeat Ansem , and seal the door to Kingdom Hearts with the help of Riku and King Mickey on the other side of the door . Kairi remains back home to await her friends ' return . 
 In Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories , Sora and his two friends begin searching for Riku and King Mickey . They arrive at a fortress called Castle Oblivion , where they encounter members of a mysterious group called Organization XIII , which is made up of non @-@ existent beings called the Nobodies . While in the castle , the three 's memories are manipulated by a girl named Naminé . After defeating the Organization , the three are put to sleep for a year by Naminé to allow them to regain their memories , though they must lose the memories of their experience in Castle Oblivion . Meanwhile , Riku appears in the basement of the castle and travels up to the surface with the aid of Mickey . Riku then keeps Sora and Naminé safe until Sora is awoken . In Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days , a snag in the plan over the year forces Riku to capture Roxas , the thirteenth member of the Organization , in order to enable Sora 's reawakening . 
 In Kingdom Hearts II , Sora and friends awaken from their sleep and resume their search for Riku and King Mickey , passing through Twilight Town and meeting Yen Sid , learning of the Nobodies and becoming re @-@ familiarized with Organization XIII . Sora once again travels to many Disney @-@ themed worlds and resolves the trouble caused by the Heartless and Nobodies , and Maleficent 's servant Pete . They reunite with King Mickey and encounter Xemnas , the leader of Organization XIII . The Organization 's plan is also revealed — they seek the power of " Kingdom Hearts " , the sum of all the hearts that Sora released by destroying the Heartless with his Keyblade , to regain their lost hearts . The three arrive at the headquarters of Organization XIII and team up with their friends and Kairi , who went to find Sora earlier . Ansem the Wise uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts ' power , but it self @-@ destructs , engulfing Ansem . At the top of the Castle that Never Was , Sora and his friends battle Xemnas . After Sora and Riku defeat Xemnas , they get trapped in the Realm of Darkness , but a letter from Kairi summons a gateway for them and the two are reunited with their friends at their home . 
 Sometime later , Sora , Riku and Kairi receive a letter from King Mickey 's detailing parts of their past that Naminé learned while restoring Sora 's memory , and Mickey found out about during the events of Kingdom Hearts Coded . As they read the letter , they learn about the exploits of the three Keyblade wielders ' fates during the events of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep ( a decade before Kingdom Hearts ) by the hands of Xehanort while trying to recreate the legendary χ @-@ blade which all Keyblades are modeled after and plunge the worlds into chaos : Terra is converted by Xehanort 's experiments to turn his heart into " Ansem " and his body into Xemnas ; Ventus sacrifices himself to stop Xehanort 's plan to obtain the χ @-@ blade , and his heart ended up with the body of Sora himself , and new Keyblade Master Aqua ends up trapped in the Realm of Darkness after sacrificing herself to save Terra . King Mickey also discovers that the destruction of " Ansem " and Xemnas has led to the reconstruction of Xehanort . To combat the new threat Xehanort poses , Sora and Riku take an exam to attain the Mark of Mastery that will allow them to become Keyblade Masters themselves . 
 During the test in Kingdom Hearts : Dream Drop Distance , Sora and Riku enter into the Realm of Sleep , where they encounter a young version of Xehanort with the ability to travel through time . The two Keyblade wielders also learn of Xehanort 's true goal : creating thirteen replicas of himself by placing a piece of his own heart in each " host " , thus taking it over , then pitting them against seven hearts of pure light in an ultimate battle to recreate the χ @-@ blade once more . Though the Organization was defeated , Xehanort had a second plan to become " Ansem " and give give his younger self the ability to travel through time and gather other versions of Xehanort together to form the Thirteen Seekers of Darkness . Sora is narrowly saved from becoming Xehanort 's final vessel , and Riku learns that data was implanted in Sora during his year @-@ long sleep that may be able to be used to save both those who are lost and ceased to be . At the end of the exam , Riku is declared a Keyblade Master , and Sora embarks on a new journey alone to train . In the meantime , to defend the Princesses of Heart from Xehanort , the Seven Guardians of Light are formed from any available Keyblade users ( including Kairi ) to combat the Thirteen <unk> in the upcoming final battle against Xehanort . 
 = = = Gameplay = = = 
 The Kingdom Hearts games contain elements of both action and role @-@ playing video games . The games are driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next , usually shown in the form of a cutscene , though there are numerous side quests available that provide bonus benefits to the characters . In most games , the player primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series , Sora . Sora is usually accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy , who are artificial intelligence @-@ controlled non @-@ playable characters that aid Sora in battle . In the first and third game , their behavior can be altered to suit different combat objectives . The games feature real @-@ time combat that incorporates physical attacks , magic , and summonings , though each game handles battles differently . The game also allows for items to be used on the field of battle to heal oneself or one 's party members . 
 Gummi Ships are another common element of the series , which serve as the main mode of transportation between worlds in the games . The gameplay for the Gummi Ship sections is more akin to a rail shooter . Because it received negative criticism in the first game , it was modified in the third title . Most games also feature a journal which is accessible from the main menu . This journal keeps track of information regarding the story , characters , enemies , and locations . In the first three games , the journal is kept by Jiminy Cricket , who was appointed by Queen Minnie as the royal chronicler . In 358 / 2 Days , Birth by Sleep and Dream Drop Distance , the main characters write their own journal entries . 
 The games are influenced by their parent franchise , Final Fantasy , and carry its gameplay elements over into their own action @-@ based , hack @-@ and @-@ slash system . Like many traditional role @-@ playing games , Kingdom Hearts features an experience point system which determines character development . As enemies are defeated , the player gains experience which culminates in a " level @-@ up " , where the characters grow stronger and gain access to new abilities . The amount of experience is shared with all party members and each character grows stronger as experience is gained . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music for the series has been primarily composed by Yoko Shimomura . Kaoru Wada works as the arranger for orchestral music , including orchestral renditions of the main vocal themes and the ending themes . The orchestral music was performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra . Soundtracks were released for the first and third installments following the release of their respective games . A compilation soundtrack was later released that included soundtracks for the entire series , including reworked tracks for the re @-@ released Kingdom Hearts Re : Chain of Memories . 
 While the themes for some of the Disney @-@ based worlds are taken directly from their Disney film counterparts , most of them are given entirely original musical scores . In addition to each world having unique background music , each is given its own battle theme rather than having a common theme to cover all fights . Several of the main characters have themes , and the final boss of each game has several themes played in the various phases of those fights . The fights with Sephiroth feature a modified version of Nobuo Uematsu 's " One @-@ Winged Angel " from Final Fantasy VII . 
 The main theme songs for the Kingdom Hearts games were written and performed by Japanese pop star , Hikaru Utada . The two main themes are " Hikari " , from Kingdom Hearts and Chain of Memories , and " Passion " , from Kingdom Hearts II . Each song has an English counterpart , " Simple and Clean " and " Sanctuary " respectively , for the North American and European releases . Utada was the only singer Tetsuya Nomura had in mind for the first Kingdom Hearts theme song . This marked the first time Utada had produced a song for a video game . Both theme songs reached notable popularity in Japan . On weekly Oricon charts , " Hikari " reached No. 1 in 2002 and " Passion " reached No. 4 in 2005 . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = History = = = 
 The initial idea for Kingdom Hearts began with a discussion between Shinji Hashimoto and Hironobu Sakaguchi about Super Mario 64 . They were planning to make a game with freedom of movement in three dimensions like Super Mario 64 but lamented that only characters as popular as Disney 's could rival a Mario game . Tetsuya Nomura , overhearing their conversation , volunteered to lead the project and the two producers agreed to let him direct . A chance meeting between Hashimoto and a Disney executive in an elevator — Square and Disney had previously worked in the same building in Japan — allowed Hashimoto to pitch the idea directly to Disney . Development began in February 2000 with Nomura as director and Hashimoto as producer . While Nomura had done previous work in the Final Fantasy series as monster designer and graphic director , he did not gain widespread recognition until he was the lead character designer for Final Fantasy VII . Kingdom Hearts marked his transition into a directorial position , though he also served as the game 's character designer . Scenarios were provided by Kazushige Nojima who was a scenario writer for Square from Final Fantasy VII until he left in 2003 . Originally the development focused on the gameplay with a simple story to appeal to Disney 's target age range . After Kingdom Hearts executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi told Nomura the game would be a failure if it did not aim for the same level as the Final Fantasy series , he began to develop the story further . In June 2013 , Nomura stated the name of the game came from him thinking about Disney Theme Parks , especially Animal Kingdom . However , Nomura could not get the IP with just " Kingdom " , so the development team began to think about " heart " as a core part of the story , so they decided to combine the two to form " Kingdom Hearts " . 
 Nomura placed a secret trailer in Kingdom Hearts in hopes that fans would want a sequel . He was unsure if fans would want a sequel and felt that if they did not , then it would be best to leave certain events in the first game unexplained . After Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was completed , development for Kingdom Hearts II began . There were several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel . One was the development team 's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more ; Mickey 's inclusion in the first game was restricted to a very small role . Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained . To bridge the gap between the two games , Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories was developed . Nomura was hesitant about releasing a game on the Game Boy Advance because he felt the 3D graphics of the original game would not translate well into 2D . He changed his position after hearing that children wanted to play Kingdom Hearts on the handheld system . 
 = = = Creation and design = = = 
 Though Disney gave Nomura freedom in the characters and worlds used for the games , he and his staff tried to stay within the established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds . Nomura has stated that though many of the Disney characters are not normally dark and serious , there were not many challenges making them so for the story , and despite this , their personalities shine because they maintain their own characteristics . He also felt managing and keeping multiple worlds was problematic . When deciding which worlds to include in the game , the development staff tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting and made an effort to minimize any overlap in the overall look and feel of each world . 
 The inclusion of specific Final Fantasy characters was based on the opinions of both fans and staff . Another criterion for inclusion was whether the staff felt the characters would fit into the storyline and in the Kingdom Hearts universe . Initially , Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design , because he was unfamiliar with the backstory of such characters . For Kingdom Hearts II , he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff . Throughout the development of the games , Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games . Nomura does this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination . He has stated that with speculation , even though a game gets old , people can still be happy with it .

Initial details were that it would be a collaboration between Square and Disney Interactive , and would feature worlds developed by both companies and Disney characters .

It was also announced that many of the Disney characters would be voiced by the official voice actors from their respective Disney films . 
 A secret trailer in the first Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts Final Mix hinted at the possibility of a sequel . Rumors for a sequel on the PlayStation 2 were spurred in Japan when a Japanese video game site , <unk> , stated that " an internal ( and anonymous ) source at Square Japan " confirmed that development of Kingdom Hearts II had begun . It was not until Kingdom Hearts II was announced , along with Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories , at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2003 that rumors were confirmed . Initial details were that it would take place some time after Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories , which takes place directly after the first game .

 = Tallinn Offensive = 
 The Tallinn Offensive ( Russian : <unk> <unk> операция ) was a strategic offensive by the Red Army 's 2nd Shock and 8th Armies and the Baltic Fleet against the German Army Detachment Narwa and Estonian units in mainland Estonia on the Eastern Front of World War II on 17 – 26 September 1944 . Its German counterpart was the abandonment of the Estonian territory in a retreat codenamed Operation Aster ( German : Unternehmen Aster ) . 
 The Soviet offensive commenced with the Soviet 2nd Shock Army breaching the defence of the II Army Corps along the Emajõgi River in the vicinity of Tartu . The defenders managed to slow the Soviet advance sufficient for Army Detachment Narwa to be evacuated from mainland Estonia in an orderly fashion . On 18 September , the constitutional Government of Estonia captured the government buildings in Tallinn from the Germans and the city was abandoned by the German forces by 22 September . The Leningrad Front seized the capital and took the rest of mainland Estonia by 26 September 1944 .

 = = = Prelude = = = 
 Attacks by the Leningrad Front had pushed Army Group North west of Lake Peipus , resulting in a series of operations around Narva . In the south , Soviet forces had advanced towards the Baltic coast at the end of Operation Bagration the Belorussian strategic offensive ( June – August 1944 ) against Army Group Centre . The Soviet Tallinn Offensive was designed as a part of the Baltic Offensive to eliminate the positions of Army Group North along the Baltic . 
 Stavka began an intricate supply and transport operation , to move the 2nd Shock Army from the Narva front to the Emajõgi river on September 5 , 1944 . The 25th River Boat Brigade and engineer troops were ordered by Stavka to ferry the units over Lake Peipus . Five crossings were built from the Russian settlement of <unk> across the 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) -wide sound of <unk> to the Estonian village of <unk> . Forty @-@ six vessels worked 24 hours a day to carry 135 @,@ 000 troops , 13 @,@ 200 horses , 9 @,@ 100 lorries , 2 @,@ 183 artillery and 8 @,@ 300 tons of ammunition across the lake . Luftwaffe units observed the move without intervening . The 2nd Shock Army acquired command over the Emajõgi front from the 3rd Baltic Front on 11 September 1944 . 
 The three Soviet Baltic Fronts launched their Riga Offensive Operation on 14 September , along the German 18th Army front segment from the town of Madona in Latvia to the mouth of the Väike Emajõgi river . In the Estonian section , from the Valga railway junction to Lake Võrtsjärv , the Soviet 3rd Baltic Front attacked the German XXVIII Army Corps . The German and Estonian Omakaitse units held their positions and prevented the Army Detachment Narwa from being encircled in Estonia . 
 = = = Soviet objectives = = = 
 The Soviet forces attempted to capture Estonia and its capital Tallinn . Stavka hoped a quick breakthrough at the Emajõgi front would open a path for the armoured units to the north , thus cutting the Army Detachment Narwa off from the rest of Army Group North . The Red Army command presumed that the main direction of retreat for the German forces would be Tallinn , and concentrated their forces there in an attempt to block the roads . 
 = = = German objectives = = = 
 Army Group North had already considered abandoning Estonia in February 1944 , during the Soviet Kingisepp @-@ Gdov Offensive . A large number of units would have been freed up with changes to the front , but the Narva front continued to be defended on Hitler 's orders . The German Command considered it important to maintain control over the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland to ease the situation in Finland and keep the Soviet Baltic Fleet trapped in the eastern bay of the gulf . The retention of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida @-@ Viru was important for economic reasons . 
 The exit of Finland from the war on 3 September provided the political impetus for abandoning Estonia . The next day , Generaloberst Heinz Guderian suggested that it would not be possible to hold Ostland and ordered plans for the evacuation operation , codenamed Königsberg , to be drawn up . Hitler , however , declared that Ostland must not be given up at any cost , since doing so would provide support to those Finns that did not favour the new course of the government , and would influence Sweden to maintain its current foreign policy . After lunch , Guderian ordered that the Königsberg plan nevertheless be secretly initiated . On the next day , Oberst Natzmer visited the headquarters of Army Detachment Narwa to discuss details of the evacuation . On 11 September , the evacuation of Estonia was discussed in the Army Headquarters at length . On 15 September , the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Army Group , Generaloberst Ferdinand Schörner , requested that Guderian convince Hitler to order the evacuation of German troops from the continental part of Estonia , codenamed Operation Aster . Schörner emphasised that although the front was still holding , delaying the order would mean the units in Estonia would be trapped . Hitler agreed on 16 September . 
 According to the plan , the main forces of Army Group Narwa had to withdraw mainly through Viljandi and Pärnu to Riga . In order to do that , II Army Corps at the Emajõgi front and XXVIII Army Corps at the Väike Emajõgi had to keep the front line stable until the Army Detachment had passed behind them . Officially , the beginning of the operation was supposed to be September 19 . The retreat was to be gradual , over several lines of resistance . The withdrawal was to be backed mainly by the units consisting of Estonians , who , by the estimates of the German army command , would not have wanted to leave Estonia anyway . A naval force under Vice @-@ Admiral Theodor Burchardi began evacuating elements of the German formations along with some civilians on 17 September . The headquarters prepared a detailed plan to leave their positions at the Narva front on the night of 18 – 19 September . 
 = = = Estonian objectives = = = 
 Various Estonian troops , which used men who had deserted from the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS ( 1st Estonian ) , Omakaitse militia , border defence and auxiliary police battalions , had no general planning . However , their aim was to defend the independence of Estonia .

 By the beginning of the Tallinn Offensive on 17 September at the Emajõgi front , the II German Army Corps was reduced to a modest division of 4 @,@ 600 men , while defending against the 140 @,@ 000 men of the 2nd Shock Army . While the II Army Corps had practically no armoured forces , the 3rd Baltic Front deployed 300 armoured vehicles .

The 15 @,@ 000 strong III SS ( Germanic ) Panzer Corps stood against the Soviet 8th Army numbering 55 @,@ 000 troops at the Narva front . The pro @-@ independence Estonian troops numbered 2 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Operations = = 
 The 3rd Baltic Front commenced their offensive in the early morning of 17 September . After the German II Army Corps were subjected to an artillery barrage of 132 @,@ 500 shells , the three leading rifle corps crossed the Emajõgi River in the 25 km long section of the front east of Tartu and breached the defence . The 2nd Shock Army forced its way through to the German divisional headquarters and artillery positions . Only Kampfgruppe <unk> , stationed near Tartu , held their frontage , albeit with heavy losses . Army Detachment Narwa and XXVIII Corps , the northernmost elements of Army Group North , were at risk of getting encircled and destroyed . General Ferdinand Schörner ordered II Army Corps to abandon the defence of the Emajõgi and to move quickly around the northern tip of Lake Võrtsjärv to Latvia . 
 Six Estonian border defence regiments , the 113th Security Regiment , and remnants of the 20th Waffen SS Division retreating from the most distant part of the Narva front in the Krivasoo swamp were blocked by the advance units of the 8th Estonian Rifle Corps and destroyed in the battles of <unk> and <unk> on 20 and 21 September . Estonians of the Soviet rifle corps murdered their compatriots that had been taken prisoner at <unk> and the wounded sheltering in the <unk> Parish church . 
 The defence allowed Army Detachment Narwa to escape from Estonia as the III ( Germanic ) SS Panzer Corps and the 11th Infantry Division abandoned their positions , unbeknownst to the Soviet 8th Army . The Soviet forces began advancing in the early morning , took Jõhvi , and by evening reached the <unk> – Jõhvi – Kurtna line , also taking 63 POW . The Panzer Corps itself declared 30 dead or MIA , and 30 wounded . On the night of 20 September , the headquarters of the Corps were near Pärnu on the southwestern coast , alongside the " Nederland " , " Nordland " and the 11th Infantry Division headquarters . The " Nordland " and the 11th Infantry divisions were sent to Latvia , under the command of the 16th Army . The " Nederland " was left to organise the defence of Pärnu . On 23 September , " Nederland " dynamited the harbour and retreated to Latvia . On 24 September near <unk> on the Latvian border the rearguard of the " Nederland " carried out its final battle on Estonian ground , destroying 12 – 15 Soviet tanks . 
 Military personnel , the wounded , institutions and industries , prisoners and civilians were evacuated mostly by sea . The chief of evacuation for the navy was the Admiral of the Eastern Baltic Sea , Theodor Burchardi . He was mainly responsible for securing the evacuation from Tallinn and Paldiski . For this purpose , he commanded the 24th Landing Flotilla , 14th Security Flotilla , 31st Mine Trawler Flotilla , 5th Security Flotilla and 1st Evacuation Flotilla , with a total of approximately 50 small warships , launches , escort ships and other vessels . Within six days , around 50 @,@ 000 troops , 20 @,@ 000 civilians , 1 @,@ 000 POWs and 30 @,@ 000 tons of goods were removed from Estonia , 38 @,@ 000 of the military personnel by sea . In the course of the evacuation from Tallinn , the following ships suffered serious damage from Soviet air army attacks : on board the " <unk> " and " Vp 1611 " , 8 people killed and 29 wounded ; the " RO @-@ 22 " hit and 100 personnel killed ; the hospital ship " <unk> " , with 1 @,@ 155 refugees , wounded and crew on board , sunk in the middle of the Baltic sea with 637 dead . The evacuation by sea , despite the fact that the time for evacuation was much shorter than planned , was considered a complete success , with only 0 @.@ 9 % of the evacuees killed . 
 On 18 September 1944 , the provisional government formed by the National Committee of the Republic of Estonia in Tallinn re @-@ declared the independence of Estonia . Estonian military units clashed with German troops in Tallinn , seizing the state offices at <unk> . The government appealed to the Soviet Union to recognize the independence of the republic . 
 By the time the advance units of the Leningrad Front arrived at Tallinn early on 22 September , German troops had practically abandoned the city and the streets were empty . The last German unit to leave Tallinn that morning was the 531st Navy Artillery Battalion . Before embarkation , all stationary artillery and armaments , special equipment , guns that could not be evacuated , ammunition , the telephone exchange , the radio broadcast house , locomotives and railroad cars , and the railway were destroyed . The Tallinn power plant was fired upon from the sea and the Old City Harbour was destroyed . The retreating German units had no combat contact with the Red Army in Tallinn . The Government of Estonia had failed to concentrate the Estonian soldiers retreating from the Narva and Emajõgi fronts , as the units were scattered and mixed with the German detachments withdrawing towards Latvia . Therefore , the government lacked significant military forces to repulse the Soviet forces concentrated around Tallinn . The units securing the national capital and the government were led by Rear Admiral Johan <unk> . Troops of the Leningrad Front seized Tallinn on 22 September . Jüri Uluots , acting President of Estonia , evacuated to Sweden . In the following days , several pro @-@ independence Estonian battle groups attacked the Soviet troops in <unk> and <unk> counties without success . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The German evacuation had been carried out in an orderly fashion . Army Group North 's plans had paid off and both the Soviets and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ( German High Command ) was surprised and impressed by the speed of the evacuation . The 8th Army went on to take the remaining West Estonian islands ( Moonsund archipelago ) in the Moonsund Landing Operation , an amphibious attack . Overall , the Baltic Offensive resulted in the expulsion of German forces from Estonia , Lithuania and a large part of Latvia . 
 = = = Soviet reoccupation = = = 
 Soviet rule of Estonia was re @-@ established by force , and sovietisation followed , which was mostly carried out in 1944 – 1950 . The forced collectivisation of agriculture began in 1947 , and was completed after the mass deportation of Estonians in March 1949 . All private farms were confiscated , and farmers were made to join the collective farms . An armed resistance movement of ' forest brothers ' was active until the mass deportations . A total of 30 @,@ 000 participated or supported the movement ; 2 @,@ 000 were killed . The Soviet authorities fighting the forest brothers suffered also hundreds of deaths . Among those killed on both sides were innocent civilians . Besides the armed resistance of the forest brothers , a number of underground nationalist schoolchildren groups were active . Most of their members were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment . The punitive actions decreased rapidly after Joseph Stalin 's death in 1953 ; from 1956 – 58 , a large part of the deportees and political prisoners were allowed to return to Estonia . Political arrests and numerous other kind of crimes against humanity were committed all through the occupation period until the late 1980s . After all , the attempt to integrate Estonian society into the Soviet system failed . Although the armed resistance was defeated , the population remained anti @-@ Soviet . This helped the Estonians to organise a new resistance movement in the late 1980s , regain their independence in 1991 , and then rapidly develop a modern society . 
 = Battles of the Kinarot Valley = 
 The Battles of the Kinarot Valley ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , is a collective name for a series of military engagements between the Haganah and the Syrian army during the 1948 Arab – Israeli War , fought between May 15 – 22 , 1948 in the Kinarot Valley . It includes two main sites : the Battle of Degania – Samakh ( Tzemah ) , and battles near Masada – Sha 'ar HaGolan . The engagements were part of the battles of the Jordan Valley , which also saw fighting against Transjordan in the area of Gesher . 
 The battles began shortly after the Israeli declaration of independence , when Syria shelled Ein Gev on the night of May 15 – 16 . They were the first military engagement between Israel and Syria . On May 18 , Syria attacked the Israeli forward position in Samakh ( Tzemah ) , and on May 20 attacked Degania Alef and occupied Masada and Sha 'ar HaGolan . The attack on Degania Alef was a failure , after which the Syrian forces attempted to capture Degania Bet . After reaching a stalemate , they retreated to their initial position in Tel al @-@ Qasr , where they remained until the end of the war . 
 The campaign was perceived as a decisive Israeli victory , causing reorganizations in the Syrian high command and the birth of heroic tales in Israel . However , Syria made a small territorial gain and certain actions were criticized within Israel , such as the retreat from Masada and Sha 'ar HaGolan . 
 = = Background = = 
 The first stage of the 1948 War , referred to as the 1947 – 1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine , started following the ratification of UN Resolution 181 on November 29 , 1947 , which granted Israel the mandate to declare independence . This was declared on May 14 , 1948 and the next night , the armies of a number of Arab states invaded Israel and attacked Israeli positions . 
 The Arab states surrounding the Mandate of Palestine started to prepare themselves a few weeks before May 15 . According to the Arab plan , the Syrian army was to attack the new state from southern Lebanon and capture Safed . As such , the Syrians massed their forces in that area ; however , after they found out that Lebanon did not wish to actively participate in combat , their plans changed to an attack from the southern Golan Heights on Samakh ( Tzemah ) and later Tiberias . The Syrian force assembled in Qatana on May 1 . It moved on May 12 to Beirut and to Sidon on May 13 , after which it headed to Bint Jbeil . After the sudden plan change , the force moved to <unk> , and proceeded around the Finger of the Galilee to Banias and Quneitra , from which the eventual attack was staged . 
 The Syrian Army was meant to consist of two brigade @-@ sized units , but there was no time to prepare them , thus only the 1st Brigade was in a state of readiness by May 15 . It had about 2 @,@ 000 soldiers in two infantry battalions , one armored battalion , and 4 – 6 artillery batteries . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 According to plan , the Syrians attacked from the southern Golan Heights , just south of the Sea of Galilee through al @-@ Hama and the Yarmouk River , hitting a densely populated Jewish area of settlement . This came as a surprise to the Haganah , which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar <unk> . The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev , Masada , Sha 'ar HaGolan and both Deganias . 
 On Friday , May 14 , the Syrian 1st Infantry Brigade , commanded by Colonel Abdullah Wahab el @-@ Hakim , was in Southern Lebanon , positioned to attack <unk> . That day Hakim was ordered to return to Syria , move south across the Golan and enter Palestine south of the Sea of Galilee through Samakh ( Tzemah ) . He began to advance at 9 : 00 AM on Saturday and had only two of his battalions , where the soldiers were already exhausted . 
 At the onset of the invasion , the Syrian force consisted of a reinforced infantry brigade , supplemented by at least one armored battalion ( including Renault R35 tanks ) and a field artillery battalion . The troops moved to Kafr Harib and were spotted by Haganah reconnaissance , but because the attack was not expected , the Israeli troops did not attack the invaders . At night between 15 and 16 May , the bulk of the Syrian forces set up camp in Tel al @-@ Qasr in the southwestern Golan . One company with armored reinforcements split up to the south to proceed to the Jewish water station on the Yarmouk riverbank . 
 The Haganah forces in the area consisted of several units from the Barak ( 2nd ) Battalion of the Golani Brigade , as well as the indigenous villagers , including a reduced Guard Corps ( HIM ) company at the Samakh ( Tzemah ) police station . This force was headed by the battalion commander 's deputy , who was killed in action in the battle . On May 13 , the battalion commander declared a state of emergency in the area from May 15 until further notice . He authorized his men to seize all necessary arms from the settlements and urged them to dig in and build fortifications as fast as possible , and to mobilize all the necessary work force to do so . 
 = = Battles = = 
 On Saturday night , May 15 , the observation posts reported many vehicles with full lights moving along the Golan ridge east of the Sea of Galilee . The opening shots were fired by Syrian artillery on kibbutz Ein Gev at approximately 01 : 00 on May 16 . At dawn , Syrian aircraft attacked the Kinarot valley villages . The following day , a Syrian company which split from the main force attacked the water station with heavy weaponry , where every worker was killed except one . 
 An Israeli reserve unit was called in from Tiberias . It arrived after twenty minutes and took positions around the town . At that point , Samakh ( Tzemah ) was defended by three platoons from the Barak battalion and reinforcements from neighboring villages . They entrenched in the actual village , which had been abandoned by the residents in April 1948 , with British escort . Positions in the village included the police station in the west , the cemetery in the north , the <unk> neighborhood in the south , and the railway station . The Syrians set up their positions in an abandoned British military base just east of the village and in an animal quarantine station to the southeast . 
 Two Israeli sappers were sent to mine the area of the quarantine station , but did not know that it was already under Syrian control . Their vehicle was blown up , but they managed to escape alive . On the same day , the Syrian company that attacked the water station from Tel ad @-@ <unk> proceeded towards Sha 'ar HaGolan and Masada . Its advance was halted by the village residents as well as a platoon of reinforcements armed with 20 mm cannons . The company retreated to its position and commenced artillery fire on the two kibbutzim . 
 This development gave the Israeli forces time to organize their defenses at Samakh ( Tzemah ) . During the course of May 16 , Israeli gunboats harassed the Syrian positions on the southeastern Sea of Galilee shore , trenches were dug , and roadblocks were set up . Meanwhile , Syrian aircraft made bombing runs on Masada , Sha 'ar HaGolan , Degania Bet and <unk> . The attack on Samakh ( Tzemah ) resumed before dawn on May 17 — the Syrians attacked the village 's northern positions , but their armor stayed behind . The infantry thus could not advance into the concentrated Israeli fire from the village itself , despite severe ammunition shortages on the Israeli side . 
 Meanwhile , the defenders of Tiberias believed their town would be targeted next , and built barricades and fortifications . Ben @-@ Gurion told the cabinet that " The situation is very grave . There aren 't enough rifles . There are no heavy weapons " . Aharon Israeli , a platoon leader , commented that there was also a severe lack of experienced field commanders — he himself was hastily promoted on May 15 , despite not having sufficient knowledge or experience . Also on May 16 , the Syrian President , Shukri al @-@ Quwatli , visited the front with his Prime Minister , Jamil Mardam , and his Defense Minister , Taha al @-@ Hashimi . He told his forces " to destroy the Zionists " . 
 At night , A Syrian force attempted to surround the Israelis by crossing the Jordan River to the north of the Sea of Galilee , but encountered a minefield in which a senior Syrian officer was wounded . This was spotted and reported by the Israelis at <unk> , and the additional reprieve allowed the Kinarot Valley villages to evacuate the children , elderly and sick , as well as conduct maneuvers which feigned massive reinforcements in the <unk> @-@ <unk> region . In the panic of surprise , many men also tried to flee the frontal villages , but <unk> were set up near Afula and Yavne 'el by the Military Police Service 's northern command , under Yosef Pressman , who personally stopped buses and allowed only the women and children to proceed to safety . 
 = = = Samakh ( Tzemah ) = = = 
 At about 04 : 30 on May 18 , the Syrian 1st Brigade , now commanded by Brigadier General Husni al @-@ Za 'im and consisting of about 30 vehicles , including tanks , advanced west towards Samakh ( Tzemah ) in two columns — one across the coast , and another flanking from the south . A contingent was allocated further south , in order to secure the safety of the main force by flanking Sha 'ar HaGolan and Masada from the west . It entered a stalemate with a new Israeli position northwest of the two villages . 
 The coastal column shelled the Israeli positions and inflicted enormous damage ; the Israelis were either dug in within shallow trenches made for infantry warfare with no head cover , or in Samakh 's clay houses that were vulnerable to heavy weapons . The Israelis were eventually forced to abandon their posts and concentrate in the police station , where they brought the wounded . The deputy commander of the Golani Brigade , <unk> Levkov , also arrived at the station , and called reinforcements from Sha 'ar HaGolan and Tiberias , which did not manage to arrive on time . 
 A soldier who participated in the battle reported that only 20 uninjured troops were left to defend the police station as the second Syrian column reached Samakh ( Tzemah ) . The only heavy weapon the defenders possessed was ineffective against Syrian armor . Fearing their forces would be completely cut off , an order was given by the Haganah to retreat and leave the wounded , <unk> Levkov among them . The retreat was disorganized and heavy Israeli casualties were recorded as Samakh 's police station fell . Reinforcements from the Deganias , commanded by Moshe Cohen , arrived but were immediately hit by the Syrians and did not significantly affect the battle . Aharon Israeli , a platoon commander in these reinforcements , wrote that it was clear as soon as they arrived that the battle was over . Cohen would not hear of a retreat initially , but when the force saw Levkov fall into a trench , they hastily withdrew . 
 On the same day , Syrian aircraft bombed the Israeli village <unk> and the regional school Beit <unk> , on the southwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee . By evening , Samakh ( Tzemah ) had fallen and a new Israeli defensive line was set up in the Deganias , facing the Syrian counterparts . At night , a Palmach company from Yiftach 's 3rd Battalion attempted to recapture Samakh 's police station . They stealthily reached the school next to the station , but the assault on the actual fort was warded off . On the morning of May 19 , a message was sent from Sha 'ar HaGolan and Masada that they were preparing for an evacuation , although when the order was given to stay put , the villages had already been abandoned , mostly to <unk> . In the morning , when the villagers carried out an order to return to their positions , local Arabs were already present at the location . The Syrian troops then captured the villages without a fight , and proceeded to loot and destroy them . Aharon Israeli wrote that an order was given not to disclose the flight of Masada and Sha 'ar HaGolan 's residents , but this became clear as fire and smoke rose from the villages , and hurt the morale of the Israelis making defensive preparations in the Deganias . 
 The counterattack on the police station failed but delayed the Syrian attack on the Deganias by twenty @-@ four hours . In the evening of May 19 , a delegation from the Deganias arrived in Tel Aviv to ask for reinforcements and heavy weapons . One of its members later wrote that David Ben @-@ Gurion told them he could not spare them anything , as " The whole country is a front line " . He also wrote that Yigael Yadin , the Chief Operations Officer of the Haganah , told him that there was no alternative to letting the Arabs approach to within twenty to thirty meters of the gates of Degania and fight their tanks in close combat . Yadin prepared reinforcements , and gave an order : " No point should be abandoned . [ You ] must fight at each site " . He and Ben @-@ Gurion argued over where to send the Yishuv 's only battery of four pre @-@ World War I 65 mm mountain guns ( nicknamed " <unk> " ) , which had no proper sights . Ben @-@ Gurion wanted to send them to Jerusalem , but Yadin insisted that they be sent to the Kinarot valley , and Ben @-@ Gurion eventually agreed . 
 On the night of May 18 – 19 , a platoon departed from Ein Gev by sea to Samra and raided the Syrian contingent in Tel al @-@ Qasr . The raid failed , but may have delayed the Syrian attack on Degania , thus giving its defenders twenty @-@ four hours to prepare . A second raid , by a Yiftach company , crossed the Jordan and struck the Syrian camp at the Customs House , near the main Bnot Yaakov Bridge . After a short battle , the Syrian defenders ( one or two companies ) fled . The <unk> destroyed the camp and several vehicles , including two armored cars , without losses . 
 = = = Degania Alef = = = 
 After the fall of Tzemah , the Haganah command realized the importance of the campaign in the region , and made a clear separation between the Kinarot Valley , and the Battle of Gesher fought against Transjordan and Iraq to the south . On May 18 , Moshe Dayan , who had been born in Degania , was given command of all forces in the area , after having been charged with creating a commando battalion in the 8th Brigade just a day before . A company of reinforcements from the <unk> program was allocated , along with 3 PIATs . Other reinforcements came in the form of a company from the Yiftach Brigade and another company of paramilitaries from villages in the Lower Galilee and the Jezreel Valley . The Palmach counterattack on the police station on the night of May 18 gave the Israeli forces an additional day to prepare defense and attack plans . 
 The Israelis called the reinforcements assuming this was the main Syrian thrust . The Syrians were not intending to carry out any further operation south of the Sea of Galilee and planned to make their main effort further north , near the Bnot Ya 'akov bridge . On May 19 , the Iraqis were about to drive west through Nablus toward Tulkarm , and asked the Syrians to make a diversion in the Degania area to protect their right flank . The Syrians complied , their main objective being to seize the bridge across the river north of Degania Alef , thus blocking any Israeli attack from Tiberias against the Iraqi line of communications . 
 Heavy Syrian shelling of Degania Alef started at about 04 : 00 on May 20 from the Samakh police station , by means of 75 mm cannons , and 60 and 81 mm mortars . The barrage lasted about half an hour . At 04 : 30 on May 20 , the Syrian army began its advance on the Deganias and the bridge over the Jordan River north of Degania Alef . Unlike the attack on Samakh ( Tzemah ) , this action saw the participation of nearly all of the Syrian forces stationed at Tel al @-@ Qasr , including infantry , armor and artillery . The Israeli defenders numbered about 70 persons ( 67 according to Aharon Israeli 's head count ) , most of them not regular fighters , with some Haganah and Palmach members . Their orders were to fight to the death . They had support from three 20 mm guns at Beit <unk> , deployed along the road from Samakh to Degania Alef . They also had a <unk> mortar , which exploded during the battle , and a PIAT with fifteen projectiles . 
 At night , a Syrian expeditionary force attempted to infiltrate Degania Bet , but was caught and warded off , which caused the main Syrian force to attack Degania Alef first . At 06 : 00 , the Syrians started a frontal armored attack , consisting of 5 tanks , a number of armored vehicles and an infantry company . The Syrians pierced the Israeli defense , but their infantry was at some distance behind the tanks . The Israelis knocked out four Syrian tanks and four armored cars with 20 mm cannons , PIATs and Molotov cocktails . Meanwhile , other defenders kept small arms fire on the Syrian infantry , who stopped in citrus groves a few hundred meters from the settlements . The surviving Syrian tanks withdrew back to the Golan . At 07 : 45 , the Syrians halted their assault and dug in , still holding most of the territory between Degania Alef 's fence and Samakh 's police fort . They left behind a number of lightly damaged or otherwise inoperable tanks that the Israelis managed to repair . 
 = = = Degania Bet = = = 
 Despite the Syrian superiority in numbers and equipment , the destruction of a multitude of armored vehicles and the infantry 's failure to infiltrate Degania Alef was the likely cause for the retreat of the main Syrian force to Samakh ( Tzemah ) . A less @-@ organized and sparsely numbered armored and infantry force forked off to attack Degania Bet . Eight tanks , supported by mortar fire , moved within 400 yards of the settlement defense , where they stopped to provide fire support for an infantry attack . The Syrians made two failed attempts to breach the Israeli small arms fire defense and gave up the attempt . Against this force , the Israelis had about 80 people and one PIAT . The defenses in Degania Bet were disorganized and there were not enough trenches . They also had no communication link to the command , so Moshe Dayan sent one of his company commanders to assess the situation . 
 While the battle was taking place , the 65 mm artillery , four Napoleonchik canons , reached the front in the middle of the day and were placed on the <unk> – <unk> ridge . It was the first Israeli artillery to be used in the war . At 13 : 20 , they began to fire at the Syrians , and about 40 rounds the latter began to retreat . The Israelis also fired into Samakh , where the Syrian officers , who had until then believed that the Israelis had nothing that could hit their headquarters , took shelter . One projectile hit the Syrian ammunition depot in the village , and others ignited fires in the dry fields . While the soldiers who operated the cannons ( still lacking sights ) were not proficient in handling them , an acceptable level of accuracy was achieved after practice shots into the Sea of Galilee . In all , the artillery fire took the Syrian army by complete surprise , and the latter decided to regroup and retreat to Tel al @-@ Qasr , also recalling the company at Sha 'ar HaGolan and Masada . A total of 500 shells were fired by the Israeli artillery . Syrian officers may have shot some of their fleeing soldiers . 
 There were two other reasons for the Syrian withdrawal . The 3rd Battalion from the Palmach 's Yiftach Brigade had been sent by boat during the previous night across the sea to Ein Gev , planning to assault and capture Kafr Harib . It was , noticed and shelled by the Syrians , but one of the companies managed to climb up the Golan . It carried out a smaller raid at dawn , bombing water carriers and threatening the Syrian 1st Brigade 's line of communications . The second reason was that they were running out of ammunition : Husni al @-@ Za 'im had been promised replenishment , and attacked Degania short of ammunition . Za 'im ordered a withdrawal when his troops ran out of ammunition . The replenishment was instead sent to the 2nd Brigade further north . The Israelis were not aware of this , and attributed the Syrian withdrawal to surprise at the Israeli artillery fire .

 On May 21 , Haganah troops returned to Samakh ( Tzemah ) and set up fortifications , The damaged tanks and armored cars were gathered and taken to the rear . The settlers returned that night to identify the bodies of their comrades in the fields and buried them in a common grave in Degania . At dawn on May 21 , the Golani staff reported that the enemy was repelled but that they were expecting another attack . The full report read : 
 Our forces repelled yesterday a heavy attack of tanks , armored vehicles and infantry that lasted about 8 hours . The attack was repelled by the brave stand of our men , who used Molotov cocktails and their hands against the tanks . 3 " mortars and heavy machinery took their toll on the enemy . Field cannons caused a panicked retreat of the enemy , who yesterday left Tzemah . This morning our forces entered Tzemah and took a large amount of booty of French ammunition and light artillery ammunition . We have captured 2 tanks and an armored vehicle of the enemy . The enemy is amassing large reinforcements . We are expecting a renewal of the attack . 
 On May 22 , villagers returned to Masada and Sha 'ar HaGolan , which had been largely destroyed . Expecting another attack , reinforcements from the Carmeli Brigade took up positions in the two villages . Many of the participants of the battles were sent to Tiberias to rest and recuperate , and the units that lost soldiers were reorganized . 
 In the wake of the fall of Gush Etzion , news of Degania 's successful stand ( as well as that of Kfar Darom ) provided a morale boost for other Israeli villages . The battle also influenced British opinion on the balance of power in the war . The success of the Napoleonchik field cannons prompted the Israeli high command to re @-@ use two of them in attempts to capture Latrun . The flight from Masada and Sha 'ar HaGolan , on the other hand , stirred controversy in the young state , fueled by news of the Kfar Etzion massacre just days before , and the Palmach issued a newsletter accusing them of abandoning national assets , among other things . These accusations were subsequently repeated in media and in a play by Yigal <unk> , and a campaign was started by the villagers to clear their name . 
 The battles of the Kinarot Valley were the first and last of the major ground engagements between Israel and Syria to the south of the Sea of Galilee , although minor patrol skirmishes continued until the first ceasefire . The campaign , combined with the Battle of Gesher , was possibly the only coordinated attack between two or more Arab countries in the northern front . At the end , the Syrians held Tel al @-@ Qasr , which was part of the British Mandate of Palestine and the Jewish state according to the UN partition of 1947 . Despite the above , the offensive was considered a decisive Syrian defeat by both sides . The Syrian defense minister Ahmad al @-@ Sharabati and Chief of Staff Abdullah <unk> blamed each other , the latter resigning and the former being dismissed by the prime minister as a result of the battle . As reasons for their defeat , they gave their low level of preparedness and the strength of the Israeli defenses , as well as their lack of coordination with the Iraqis ( according to one Syrian historian , the Iraqis were supposed to assist them in the Deganias ) . After the battle , British observers became convinced that the Arabs were not going to win the war , and compared the battle to the Luftwaffe 's failure in the Battle of Britain in 1940 , which showed that Germany was not going to win the air war . The observers said that " A greater edge than the [ Syrians ] enjoyed at Degania they won 't have again " . 
 = = = First tank kill controversy = = = 
 The first Syrian tank damaged near Degania Alef 's gates , which has been preserved on the location , was the subject of a historiographic dispute when Baruch " Burke " Bar @-@ Lev , a retired IDF colonel and one of Degania 's native defenders at the time , claimed that he was the one who stopped the tank with a Molotov cocktail . However , his account was rebutted by an IDF Ordnance Corps probe , which in 1991 determined that a PIAT shot had killed the tank 's crew . Shlomo <unk> , a Haifa resident who also participated in the battle , told Haaretz in 2007 that the tank was hit by PIAT fire from a Golani soldier , and that the Molotov cocktail could not possibly have hit the crew .

 The parody of Tom Cruise ( Kevin Bishop ) is framed through the viewpoint of the actor 's association with the Church of Scientology . The show recounts the actor 's days with a group of actors known as the Brat Pack , and how he maintains a friendship with Patrick Swayze , an actor from this crowd . ( Brat Pack is a nickname given to a group of young actors and actresses who frequently appeared together in teen @-@ oriented coming @-@ of @-@ age films in the 1980s ; Cruise has been referred to as a member due to his role in the film The Outsiders . ) While filming Top Gun , Cruise is afraid he looks " a bit gay " next to his co @-@ stars . His co @-@ stars subsequently turn into the Village People . Cruise has alien spirit guides who appear as " a pair of giant blobs who speak with Welsh accents " . They comment on Top Gun , " It 's no ET but it 's got something . " Cruise is introduced to Scientology by John Travolta ( Steve Edge ) , who presents it as a " legitimate alien @-@ race @-@ based religion " .

" Greetings , Earth Man , I am here to serve you , " says Holmes to Cruise upon their first meeting . After Cruise asks Holmes to marry him , she states , " Affirmative " . The show makes fun of Cruise 's couch jumping incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show . ( This spoof is in reference to a 2005 appearance by Cruise on the Oprah program , where he " jumped around the set , hopped onto a couch , fell to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his new girlfriend . " ) At the wedding of Cruise and Holmes , an alien bride and groom are displayed on the top of the couple 's wedding cake , and the show spoofs the couple 's wedding vows .

 Multiple publications commented on the potential legal implications of parodying both Tom Cruise and Scientology . " Given the Church of Scientology 's full @-@ throttle reaction to any criticism or mickey @-@ taking , the Star Stories boys are sure to find themselves in the firing line , " wrote a reviewer for the Evening Times . A review in The Sunday Times commented , " Taking their careers in their hands , the Star Stories team tackle the notoriously litigious Tom Cruise ... The lawyers must still be having a nice lie down after watching . " 
 In an interview with The Northern Echo , Star Stories actor Kevin Bishop discussed the legal issues involved with making the series : " We 're not allowed to say anything about anyone that isn 't true . It can be quite tricky . Sometimes we 've had to change lines even when the filming is all finished . We go back to the recording studio and put one line over another line . ... The only reason I reckon we 've not been sued is because actually we 've not said anything that technically we can 't . " He said the series was " well looked after " by attorneys . In a 2009 interview with The Independent , Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States : " I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could be bothered to watch it saw the Tom Cruise one . One guy went ' you can 't do that it 's Tom Cruise man ? [ we ’ ve done it ] ' yeah but you can 't do that on TV ' [ it 's already gone out ] ' what you ’ re talking about Scientology , are you fucking nuts ? ? [ er , look we ’ ve done it it 's been on telly and everyone loved and we 've had no complaints ] has Tom Cruise seen this ? ! "

 The Guardian and the Evening Times highlighted the Star Stories parody as the " pick of the day " . Martin Skeggs of The Guardian commented , " There 's everything you ever wanted to know about the world 's number one film star , including how he was introduced to Scientology ( John Travolta whacked him over the head with a shovel ) , the time he met Nicole Kidman and asked her if she would mind sitting down to make him look taller " . He characterized the parody as , " A toned down version of real life , then . " Barry McDonald of the Evening Times described the episode as " equally cruel and <unk> hilarious " . He commented , " This is as close to must @-@ watch television as you 're likely to get and a testament to the quality of comedy writing on display . " In a later review of the program for the Evening Times when it was shown again on re @-@ runs , McDonald wrote , " I don 't care if it 's been shown several times before , this is one of the shows which you just have to see again . " <unk> Baig of The Sun highlighted the show as " Best Spoof " , and wrote , " pint @-@ sized Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise is subjected to some serious mocking . We follow his film career , his marriages to Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes ( portrayed as a robot ) and how everything in his life has been shaped by his belief in Scientology . The show is as crude as ever " . Stephen Milton of The Sun described the parody of Cruise 's appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show as " the best gag in the whole episode " . Aidan Smith of Scotland on Sunday wrote favorably of the show , and noted , " <unk> , in view of how paranoid Scientologists are , the latest target was Tom Cruise . I especially liked the scene where the tiny screen giant winched himself , Mission Impossible @-@ style , on to Nicole Kidman while she slugged from a <unk> like a good Sheila . " 
 The Daily Mirror described the program as " far too funny " . A review in The Daily Mirror was positive , commenting , " If you want to see a brilliant spoof about Tom Cruise 's faith in Scientology and his relationship with Katie Holmes , look no further than C4 's Star Stories . " She commented , " It 's so absurd , even Tom will laugh . " The Advertiser described Star Stories as " a surprisingly funny sendup of movie stars and pop groups " , and noted of the episode 's title , " This week 's episode is titled Being Tom Cruise - How Scientology isn 't in Any Way Mental , which should give you some idea of the vein of humour mined . " The Sunday Times observed , " Just when you thought you might go a week without seeing a mention of brand Beckham , here is a documentary on their best friends , brand Tom Cruise , as recorded by the least reverential writers and least convincing lookalikes on the planet . Scientologists might prefer something on the Sci @-@ fi channel . " Victoria Segal , Sally <unk> and Sarah Dempster of The Sunday Times highlighted the episode in their " Critics ' Choice " column .

 = The Original All Blacks = 
 The Original All Blacks ( also known simply as " The Originals " ) were the first New Zealand national rugby union team to tour outside Australasia . They toured the British Isles , France and the United States of America during 1905 – 1906 . Their opening game was against Devon on 16 September 1905 whom they defeated 55 – 4 . Such was the surprise that some newspapers in Britain printed that Devon had scored 55 points and not the All Blacks . They went on to defeat every English side that they faced , including a 16 – 3 victory over English county champions Durham , and a 32 – 0 victory over Blackheath . They defeated Scotland , Ireland and England with the closest of the three matches their 12 – 7 victory over Scotland . The team 's only loss of the tour was a 3 – 0 defeat by Wales at Cardiff Arms Park . The loss was highly controversial wing Bob Deans claimed to have scored a try that would have brought them level . However , in truth Wales were generally considered the better team with the All Blacks playing particularly poorly in the first half of the game . They managed narrow wins against the Welsh club teams and went on to play France in France 's first ever Test match . They returned to New Zealand via North America where they played two matches against Canadian teams . Overall they played a total of thirty @-@ five matches , which included five Tests , and only lost once — the defeat by Wales . 
 The 1905 All Blacks tour of Britain went on to achieve legendary status within the rugby world and New Zealand in particular . They scored 976 points and conceded only 59 , and thus set the standard for all subsequent All Black sides . The tour also saw the first use of the All Blacks name and established New Zealand 's reputation as a world class rugby nation . Some of these players eventually defected to participate in the professional 1907 – 08 tour of Australia and Great Britain where they played against Northern Union sides in the sport that would eventually become known as rugby league . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 After the formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1892 , New Zealand representative teams were selected for matches against international opponents . The first tour by a New Zealand representative side under NZRFU auspices was in 1894 to New South Wales ( although an earlier team had toured Britain and Australia in 1888 – 1889 ) . New Zealand 's first Test match was in 1903 when they played Australia in Sydney . New Zealand 's first home Test Match was the following year when they defeated Britain at Athletic Park , Wellington , by 9 – 3 . The win was significant as Britain had been unbeaten in their Australian tour , yet they won only two out of five matches in New Zealand . The captain of Great Britain , David Bedell @-@ Sivright , said after the Test that he could not see New Zealand winning the big matches on their Northern Hemisphere tour , but " I think you will probably win most of the county matches . " 
 The New Zealand selectors named a squad of 53 players from which the touring team would be selected in late 1904 . The following year on 25 February , a list of 16 " certainties " for the tour was named ( one of whom would eventually not tour due to injury ) . A final opportunity for selection was the North @-@ South inter @-@ island match on 3 June 1905 after which , 25 players were selected for the team , and an additional two were added prior to the team 's departure to Britain . 
 Before the Northern Hemisphere tour , 18 of the squad conducted a preliminary three @-@ match tour of Australia where they won two matches and drew the other . They also played four pre @-@ tour matches in New Zealand , winning two , drawing one , and losing their final match 3 – 0 to Wellington . 
 The team departed for England aboard the Rimutaka on 30 July . There were two ports of call on the journey – Montevideo , and Tenerife – before their arrival in Plymouth , England . The day after their arrival on 8 September , the squad travelled 24 km ( 15 mi ) to Newton Abbot , which served as the team 's training base throughout much of the tour . 
 = = = Early matches = = = 
 Their first match took place on 16 September 1905 against Devon , who had been runners @-@ up in the most recent English county championship , and for whom played ten members of Devonport Albion , the top club in England . Because of this , Devon went into the match as favourites , however the crowd of 6 @,@ 000 at the match were soon stunned by the New Zealanders as they scored 12 tries and eventually won 55 – 4 . Billy Wallace scored 28 points , including three tries , and it would be another 51 years before another All Black would score more points in one match . The score caused a sensation in Britain , and some newspapers even incorrectly reported the score as Devon 55 , New Zealand 4 . Eventually the reports were corrected , and the New Zealanders returned to Newton Abbot to be greeted by a brass band and cheering crowd . 
 Five days later New Zealand faced Cornwall at Recreation Ground in Camborne . Although the score was only 12 – 0 at half time , the New Zealanders ended up with 11 tries , and a 41 – 0 victory . The team then travelled to play Bristol , who they played on 23 September . The game was played in front of 6 @,@ 500 spectators , with the same result as the Cornwall match , a 41 – 0 victory for New Zealand . They then travelled to Northampton , after stopping in London . The game resulted in another victory , this time 31 – 0 , to the All Blacks . By now , the All Blacks had scored 169 points in their four games , with only four against . 
 The next match was against Leicester at Welford Road on 30 September . Four players in the Leicester team would go on to play in the England Test ; more than any other club . Although the All Blacks were held scoreless for the first 25 minutes , at the time the longest period that the All Blacks had gone without scoring on tour , George Smith eventually crossed for the All Blacks first score of the game . The All Blacks ended the match 28 – 0 winners . 
 After the following match against Middlesex , won 34 – 0 by the All Blacks , The Daily Chronicle said " These New Zealanders turn defence into attack with such bewildering rapidity as to prove that scrummaging is a mere detail . There is nothing in the game in which they do not excel . " 
 The toughest game of the tour so far was against Durham County , on 7 October . Durham were the English county champions , and were the first team to score a try against the All Blacks on tour . Despite the small 6 – 3 advantage to the All Blacks at the break , they scored 10 unanswered points in the second half to win 16 – 3 . The All Blacks ' closest game of the tour so far was immediately followed by their largest win . The match against Hartlepool Clubs , one of the strongest teams in northern England , was won 63 – 0 by the All Blacks . 
 The All Blacks next three games were against Northumberland , Gloucester , and Somerset . None of the sides scored against the All Blacks ; with them losing by 31 , 44 , and 23 points to nil respectively . Four days following the Somerset match , the All Blacks faced Devonport Albion . Devonport Albion were England 's club champion , and the runners @-@ up for Great Britain club champion . 20 @,@ 000 spectators witnessed another All Blacks victory ; this time by 21 – 3 . 
 For the match against Midland Counties at Leicester , 17 @,@ 000 spectators , as well as officials from the Welsh rugby union attended the match . Although Midland Counties scored a converted try , the All Blacks retained their winning record with a 21 – 5 victory . The victory over Midland Counties was followed by an 11 – 0 victory over Surrey , and 32 – 0 victory over Blackheath . The seven try win over Blackheath was considered by Wallace to be the end of the All Blacks ' peak — " Unfortunately , after this game injuries began to take their toll and prevented us ever putting in so fine a team again on the tour . " 
 The next three game for the All Blacks would be played in five days . The All Blacks scored 13 tries , and Jimmy Hunter five of them , as they ran up a 47 – 0 victory over Oxford University . Their next match , two days later , was against Cambridge University . The Scotland Test was approaching , and the All Blacks decided to rest several players , Hunter , Billy Stead , Selling and George Gillett . Cambridge 's kicking game , and fast backs helped them to restrict the score to 14 – 0 to the All Blacks . Two days later the All Blacks faced Richmond , and scored five tries to register a 17 – 0 victory . Their last game before the Scotland Test was against a Bedford XV in Richmond . There were four All Black tries in the first half , and six in the second . The final score was 41 – 0 ; the All Blacks had now scored over 600 points on tour .

 At the time of the Tour , rugby in Scotland was a game of the upper classes , and the Scottish Rugby Union ( SRU ) was very conservative . Their officials believed the game should remain strictly amateur , and that rugby was for the players , not the spectators . The Scottish were uncomfortable with the public interest in the All Blacks , and did not make them feel very welcome . They interpreted a letter sent to them stating that the All Blacks did not want to be entertained after their match quite literally , and the All Blacks were not invited to the after @-@ match dinner organised by the Scottish Union . As well as this , the SRU refused to grant international caps for the game . 
 The game was a financial success for the NZRFU . The NZRFU had asked for a £ 500 financial guarantee from the SRU for the game , but because of their poor finances , the SRU offered instead to give the entire gate ( minus expenses ) . Due to a big attendance , the NZRFU received a fee of over £ 1700 for the game . Although the SRU were very happy with this ( they offered the same terms to the Springboks when they toured in 1906 ) , there were also concerns about the three shillings a day each All Black received whilst on tour . After they found that the Rugby Football Union had approved the payments , a Calcutta Cup match was cancelled . 
 The game was played on 18 November on an icy pitch ( straw had not been spread over the pitch the night before ) , which nearly caused the game to be cancelled . The All Blacks kicked off , and had the best of the first ten minutes . Scotland eventually got a scrum near the All Blacks goal @-@ line , and after winning the scrum , passed to Ernest Simson , who dropped a goal to put Scotland ahead 4 – 0 . It was the first time the All Blacks had been behind on tour . The All Blacks replied with a try under the posts , which was unconverted . A second try was then scored , by Smith ; again it went unconverted . Scotland then scored an unconverted try , to lead at half time 7 – 6 . With less than ten minutes to go the score remained 7 – 6 and it looked like the All Blacks might lose their first match on tour . However , with four minutes to go the All Blacks had a scrum on halfway ; the resulting movement finished with George Smith crossing for a try . Bill Cunningham then scored a try with seconds remaining , and the All Blacks were victorious 12 – 7 . 
 Four days after the Scotland Test the All Blacks faced West of Scotland in Glasgow . The cities ' secondary schools were given half a day off to watch the match . The All Blacks scored six tries on the way to a 22 – 0 victory . The team then travelled to Ireland , for their third Test .

 The welcome extended by the Irish Rugby Football Union ( IRFU ) was in contrast to that of Scotland . The morning they arrived in Belfast they were met by several IRFU officials who took them out for breakfast . The arrival in Ireland also marked a homecoming for the captain Dave Gallaher , who was born in County Donegal , but had moved to New Zealand at the age of four . Thousands awaited the All Blacks when they arrived in the Dublin train station . On the Thursday before the Test , both teams attended the theatre together ; sitting alternatively so they could better mix . 
 The sold out Test was played on Saturday 25 November at Lansdowne Road . The 12 @,@ 000 that turned up did not get to see Gallaher though , as he was injured . Simon Mynott was also selected to play on the wing despite having never played there before , and there being three three @-@ quarters available . For a 30 @-@ minute period in the first half the Irish forwards dominated , however the deadlock was broken close to half time when Bob Deans scored a try under the posts ; Wallace converted the try giving the All Blacks a 5 – 0 half @-@ time lead . Early in the second half Deans scored another try ; again converted by Wallace . Smith lost the ball over the line before Alex McDonald scored the All Blacks third and final try . Wallace successfully converted to give the All Blacks a 15 – 0 victory . 
 The All Blacks then headed to Limerick for their one other game in Ireland . Not all of the team travelled for the match against Munster , and Dixon had even tried to get the All Blacks out of the game . The match played on Tuesday 28 November was won 33 – 0 by the All Blacks . The eight tries witnessed by the 3 @,@ 000 strong crowd included a penalty try after Fred Roberts was tripped close to the line .

 Following the Munster match the All Blacks returned to England . Due to its larger capacity , the game was played at Crystal Palace ( which had an official capacity of 50 @,@ 000 ) rather than Blackheath . Despite the official capacity , it is estimated between 70 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 people attended the match ; many of them non @-@ paying spectators . The 100 @,@ 000 spectators , including the Prince of Wales ( the future King George V ) , was a record for a rugby or football match in London . 
 The England Test was the All Blacks ' third international in as many weeks ; they had been played on successive Saturdays , with a mid @-@ week match between each . England named eight new caps in their side , and played a rover ( or wing @-@ forward ) on top of seven forwards . The game has been described as " a benefit for All Black wing Duncan McGregor " . He scored four tries in the Test — a record not equalled by an All Black until 1987 . A try was also scored by Fred Newton , and with none of the five tries converted , the score finished 15 – 0 . English sportsman C. B. Fry said after the match , " The notion that these men beat us because of our physical degeneracy is nonsense . They beat us by organisation and by tactics . " A legacy of this match is that the whistle used by the referee , Gil Evans , has been used to start the opening match of every Rugby World Cup tournament . Between tournaments the whistle is housed at the New Zealand Rugby Museum in Palmerston North and was donated to them by the chairman of the NZRFU and manager of the 1924 – 25 All Blacks . 
 The All Blacks had three more games before their Wales Test Their first was again Cheltenham on 6 December at Cheltenham . The match was won by the All Blacks 18 – 0 after they scored four tries ; three of them by Abbott . The next match was at Birkenhead against Cheshire . The All Blacks scored 10 tries and recorded their biggest win in nearly a month . The final score witnessed by the 8 @,@ 000 strong crowd at Birkenhead Park was 34 – 0 . The All Blacks ' last match before facing Wales was against Yorkshire in Leeds . The game was played in Northern Union territory , and there were many league scouts trying to recruit All Black squad members to the rival code . 24 @,@ 000 spectators watched as the All Blacks won 40 – 0 , which included 10 tries .

 The Original 's Test against Wales is still considered one of sport 's great matches . The Test was played at Cardiff Arms Park , 16 December 1905 in front of 47 @,@ 000 spectators . The All Blacks were applauded onto the park where they performed their haka in front of a silent crowd . Once they had applauded their haka , the crowd , led by ' Teddy ' Morgan , sung the Welsh national anthem Hen Wlad fy Nhadau ( Land of Our Fathers ) . The anthem was sung in an attempt to reduce the perceived psychological advantage of the haka . The match was the first time a national anthem had been sung before a sporting fixture .
