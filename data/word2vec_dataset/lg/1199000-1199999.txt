 The ZX Spectrum ( UK / <unk> <unk> <unk> / ) is an 8 @-@ bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd . 
 Referred to during development as the ZX81 Colour and <unk> , it was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair to highlight the machine 's colour display , compared with the black and white of its predecessor , the ZX81 . The Spectrum was released as eight different models , ranging from the entry level with 16 KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum + 3 with 128 KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987 ; together they sold in excess of 5 million units worldwide ( not counting clones ) . 
 The Spectrum was among the first mainstream @-@ audience home computers in the UK , similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the USA . The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine , the effects of which are still seen ; some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry . Licensing deals and clones followed , and earned Clive Sinclair a knighthood for " services to British industry " . 
 The Commodore 64 , Dragon 32 , Oric @-@ 1 and Atmos , BBC Microcomputer and later the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s . Over 24 @,@ 000 software titles have been released since the Spectrum 's launch and new titles continue to be <unk> 100 in 2012 . In 2014 , a Bluetooth keyboard modelled on the Spectrum was announced . 
 = = Hardware = = 
 The Spectrum is based on a Zilog Z80 A CPU running at 3 @.@ 5 MHz ( or NEC <unk> @-@ 1 clone ) . The original model has 16 KB ( 16 × 1024 bytes ) of ROM and either 16 KB or 48 KB of RAM . Hardware design was by Richard <unk> of Sinclair Research , and the outward appearance was designed by Sinclair 's industrial designer Rick Dickinson . 
 Video output is through an RF modulator and was designed for use with contemporary portable television sets , for a simple colour graphic display . Text can be displayed using 32 columns × 24 rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application , from a palette of 15 shades : seven colours at two levels of brightness each , plus black . The image resolution is 256 × 192 with the same colour limitations . To conserve memory , colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution , 32 × 24 grid overlay , corresponding to the character cells . In practice , this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour . <unk> received a patent for this design . 
 An " attribute " consists of a foreground and a background colour , a brightness level ( normal or bright ) and a flashing " flag " which , when set , causes the two colours to swap at regular intervals . This scheme leads to what was dubbed colour clash or attribute clash , where a desired colour of a specific pixel could not necessarily be selected . This became a distinctive feature of the Spectrum , meaning programs , particularly games , had to be designed around this limitation . Other machines available around the same time , for example the Amstrad CPC or the Commodore 64 , did not suffer from this limitation . The Commodore 64 used colour attributes in a similar way , but a special multicolour mode , hardware sprites and hardware scrolling were used to avoid attribute clash . 
 Sound output is through a beeper on the machine itself , capable of producing one channel with 10 octaves . Software was later available that could play two channel sound . The machine includes an expansion bus edge connector and 3 @.@ 5 mm audio in / out ports for the connection of a cassette recorder for loading and saving programs and data . The " ear " port can drive headphones and the " mic " port provides line level audio out which could be amplified . 
 = = Firmware = = 
 The machine 's Sinclair BASIC interpreter is stored in ROM ( along with fundamental system @-@ routines ) and was written by Steve Vickers on contract from Nine Tiles Ltd . The Spectrum 's <unk> keyboard ( on top of a membrane , similar to calculator keys ) is marked with BASIC keywords . For example , pressing " G " when in programming mode would insert the BASIC command <unk> . 
 The BASIC interpreter was developed from that used on the ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified , but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features making it easier to use . The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81 , which did not feature lower @-@ case letters . Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound , and supported multi @-@ statement lines . The cassette interface was much more advanced , saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 ( 1500 bits per second compared to 307 ) , and unlike the ZX81 , the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations . As well as being able to save programs , the Spectrum could save the contents of arrays , the contents of the screen memory , and the contents of any defined range of memory addresses .

 Rick Dickinson came up with a number of designs for the " <unk> " project before the final ZX Spectrum design . A number of the keyboard legends changed during the design phase including ARC becoming <unk> , <unk> becoming <unk> and BACK becoming <unk> . The Spectrum reused a number of design elements of the ZX81 : The ROM code for things such as floating point calculations and expression parsing were very similar ( with a few obsolete ZX81 routines left in the Spectrum ROM ) . The simple keyboard decoding and cassette interfaces were nearly identical ( although the latter was now programmed to load / save at a higher speed ) . The central ULA integrated circuit was somewhat similar although it implemented the major enhancement over the ZX81 : A ( fully ) hardware based television raster generator ( with colour ) that indirectly gave the new machine approximately four times as much processing power as the ZX81 , simply due to the Z80 now being released from this video generation task . A bug in the ULA as originally designed meant that the keyboard did not always scan correctly , and was rectified by a " dead cockroach " ( a small circuit board mounted upside down next to the CPU ) for Issue 1 ZX Spectrums .

 The original ZX Spectrum is remembered for its rubber keyboard , diminutive size and distinctive rainbow motif . It was originally released on 23 April 1982 with 16 KB of RAM for £ 125 or with 48 KB for £ 175 ; these prices were later reduced to £ 99 and £ 129 respectively . Owners of the 16 KB model could purchase an internal 32 KB RAM upgrade , which for early " Issue 1 " machines consisted of a <unk> . Later issue machines required the fitting of 8 dynamic RAM chips and a few TTL chips . Users could mail their 16K Spectrums to Sinclair to be upgraded to 48 KB versions . Later revisions contained 64 KB of memory but were configured such that only 48 KB were usable . External 32 KB RAM packs that mounted in the rear expansion slot were available from third parties . Both machines had 16 KB of onboard ROM . 
 About 60 @,@ 000 " Issue 1 " ZX Spectrums were manufactured ; they can be distinguished from later models by the colour of the keys ( light grey for Issue 1 , blue @-@ grey for later models ) . 
 The Sinclair models featured audio line in and out , in the form of an " ear " and " mic " socket . An external tape recorder was needed to load the majority of software released . Either socket could be connected to headphones or an amplifier as an audio output , although this would not disable the internal speaker .

 Planning of the ZX Spectrum + started in June 1984 , and it was released in October the same year . This 48 KB Spectrum ( development code @-@ name TB ) introduced a new QL @-@ style case with an injection @-@ moulded keyboard and a reset button that was basically a switch that shorted across the CPU reset capacitor . Electronically , it was identical to the previous 48 KB model . It was possible to change the system boards between the original case and the Spectrum + case . It retailed for £ 179 @.@ 95 . A DIY conversion @-@ kit for older machines was available . Early on , the machine outsold the rubber @-@ key model 2 : 1 ; however , some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30 % , compared with a more usual 5 – 6 % for the older model . 
 = = = ZX Spectrum 128 = = = 
 Sinclair developed the ZX Spectrum 128 ( code @-@ named Derby ) in conjunction with their Spanish distributor <unk> . <unk> had helped adapt the ZX Spectrum + to the Spanish market after the Spanish government introduced a special tax on all computers with 64 KB RAM or less , and a law which obliged all computers sold in Spain to support the Spanish alphabet and show messages in Spanish . 
 The appearance of the ZX Spectrum 128 was similar to the ZX Spectrum + , with the exception of a large external heatsink for the internal <unk> voltage regulator added to the right hand end of the case , replacing the internal heatsink in previous versions . 
 New features included 128 KB RAM , three @-@ channel audio via the AY @-@ 3 @-@ <unk> chip , MIDI compatibility , an RS @-@ 232 serial port , an RGB monitor port , 32 KB of ROM including an improved BASIC editor , and an external keypad . 
 The machine was simultaneously presented for the first time and launched in September 1985 at the <unk> ' 85 trade show in Spain , with a price of 44 @,@ 250 pesetas . Because of the large number of unsold Spectrum + models , Sinclair decided not to start selling in the UK until January 1986 at a price of £ 179 @.@ 95 . No external keypad was available for the UK release , although the ROM routines to use it and the port itself remained . 
 The Z80 processor used in the Spectrum has a 16 @-@ bit address bus , which means only 64 KB of memory can be directly addressed . To facilitate the extra 80 KB of RAM the designers used bank switching so the new memory would be available as eight pages of 16 KB at the top of the address space . The same technique was used to page between the new 16 KB editor ROM and the original 16 KB BASIC ROM at the bottom of the address space . 
 The new sound chip and MIDI out abilities were exposed to the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command <unk> was added to switch the machine into 48K mode , keeping the current BASIC program intact ( although there is no way to switch back to 128K mode ) . To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory , a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80 KB of RAM . The new commands took the place of two existing user @-@ defined @-@ character spaces causing compatibility problems with certain BASIC programs . 
 The ZX Spectrum 128 had no internal speaker , unlike its predecessors . Sound was produced from the television speaker instead . 
 The Spanish version had the " 128K " logo in white ; the British one had the same logo in red .

 = = = ZX Spectrum + 2 = = = 
 The ZX Spectrum + 2 was Amstrad 's first Spectrum , coming shortly after their purchase of the Spectrum range and " Sinclair " brand in 1986 . The machine featured an all @-@ new grey case featuring a spring @-@ loaded keyboard , dual joystick ports , and a built @-@ in cassette recorder dubbed the " <unk> " ( like the Amstrad CPC 464 ) , but was in most respects identical to the ZX Spectrum 128 . The main menu screen lacked the Spectrum 128 's " Tape Test " option , and the ROM was altered to account for a new 1986 Amstrad copyright message . These changes resulted in minor incompatibility problems with software that accessed ROM routines at certain addresses . Production costs had been reduced and the retail price dropped to £ 139 – £ 149 . 
 The new keyboard did not include the BASIC keyword markings that were found on earlier Spectrums , except for the keywords LOAD , <unk> and RUN which were useful for loading software . This was not a major issue , as the + 2 boasted a menu system , almost identical to the ZX Spectrum 128 , where one could switch between 48K BASIC programming with the keywords , and 128K BASIC programming in which all words ( keywords and otherwise ) must be typed out in full ( although the keywords are still stored internally as one character each ) . Despite these changes , the layout remained identical to that of the 128 . 
 The ZX Spectrum + 2 power supply was a grey version of the ZX Spectrum + and 128 power supply . 
 = = = ZX Spectrum + 2A = = = 
 The ZX Spectrum + 2A was a variant of the Spectrum + 3 , housed inside a black version of the Spectrum + 2 case mouldings . The Spectrum + 2A / + 3 motherboard ( AMSTRAD part number <unk> ) was designed such that it could be assembled without the floppy disk controller or associated logic and a + 2 style " <unk> " connected . Originally , Amstrad planned to introduce an additional disk interface for the + 2A / + 2B called the AMSTRAD SI @-@ 1 , but it never appeared . If an external disk drive was added , the " + 2A " on the system OS menu would change to a + 3 . 
 The power supply of the ZX Spectrum + 2A used the same <unk> as the + 3 . The power supply purchased with the + 2A / B had " Sinclair + 2 " written on the case . 
 = = = ZX Spectrum + 3 = = = 
 The ZX Spectrum + 3 looked similar to the + 2 but featured a built @-@ in 3 @-@ inch floppy disk drive ( like the Amstrad CPC <unk> ) instead of the tape drive , and was in a black case . It was launched in 1987 , initially retailed for £ 249 and then later £ 199 and was the only Spectrum capable of running the CP / M operating system without additional hardware . 
 The + 3 saw the addition of two more 16 KB ROMs . One was home to the second part of the reorganised 128 ROM and the other hosted the + 3 's disk operating system . This was a modified version of Amstrad 's <unk> ( the disk access code used in <unk> ) , called + <unk> . These two new 16 KB ROMs and the original two 16 KB ROMs were now physically implemented together as two 32 KB chips . To be able to run CP / M , which requires RAM at the bottom of the address space , the bank @-@ switching was further improved , allowing the ROM to be paged out for another 16 KB of RAM . 
 Such core changes brought incompatibilities : 
 Removal of several lines on the expansion bus edge connector ( video , power , and <unk> ) ; caused many external devices problems ; some such as the <unk> modem could be used via the " <unk> " device . 
 Dividing <unk> into 2 lines , to disable both ROMs 
 Reading a non @-@ existent I / O port no longer returned the last attribute ; caused certain games such as Arkanoid to be unplayable 
 Memory timing changes ; certain RAM banks were now contended causing high @-@ speed colour @-@ changing effects to fail 
 The keypad scanning routines from the ROM were removed 
 move 1 byte address in ROM 
 Some older 48K and 128K games were incompatible with the machine . The ZX Interface 1 was incompatible due to differences in ROM and expansion connector , making it impossible to connect and use the Microdrive units . 
 There was a regression in sound quality from the previous 128K models - an error with a resistor placement meant sound was distorted . 
 The ZX Spectrum + 3 power supply provides the same voltages as the one supplied with + 2A / B. This power supply has the same DIN connector so can be used with the + 2A / B. The power supply purchased with the + 3 had " Sinclair + 3 " written on the case . 
 Production of the + 3 ceased in December 1990 , believed to be in response for Amstrad relaunching their CPC range . At the time , it was estimated about 15 % of ZX Spectrums sold had been + 3 models . Production of the + 2B ( the only other model then still in production ) continued , as it was believed not to be in competition with other computers in Amstrad 's product range . It was discontinued in 1992 . 
 = = = ZX Spectrum + 2B and + 3B = = = 
 The ZX Spectrum + 2B and ZX Spectrum + 3B were functionally similar in design to the Spectrum + 2A and + 3 . The main electronic differences being changes to the generation of the audio output signal to resolve problems with clipping . 
 Unlike the + 2A and + 3 , the Spectrum + 2B and + 3B do not share a common motherboard . The + 2B board ( AMSTRAD part number <unk> ) has no provision for floppy disk controller circuitry and the + 3B motherboard ( Amstrad part number <unk> ) has no provision for connecting an internal tape drive .

 Sinclair licensed the Spectrum design to Timex Corporation in the United States . An enhanced version with better sound , graphics and other modifications was marketed in the USA by Timex as the Timex Sinclair 2068 . Timex 's derivatives were largely incompatible with Sinclair systems . Some of the Timex innovations were later adopted by Sinclair Research . A case in point was the abortive Pandora portable Spectrum , whose ULA had the high resolution video mode pioneered in the <unk> . Pandora had a flat @-@ screen monitor and <unk> and was intended to be Sinclair 's business portable . After Amstrad bought the computer business of Sinclair Research , Sir Clive retained the rights to the Pandora project , and it evolved into the Cambridge Computer <unk> , launched in 1987 . 
 In India , <unk> Electronics introduced a licensed version of the Spectrum + in 1986 . Dubbed the " db Spectrum + " , it did reasonably well in the Indian market and sold many units until 1990 , when the market died away . 
 The ZX Spectrum Vega is a modern redesign of the ZX Spectrum in the form of a game console endorsed by Sir Clive Sinclair . 
 = = = Unofficial clones = = = 
 Unofficial Spectrum clones were produced , especially in the former Eastern Bloc countries ( e.g. in Romania , several models were produced ( Tim @-@ S , <unk> , <unk> , Cobra , Junior , CIP , CIP 3 , Jet ) , some featuring CP / M and a 5 @.@ 25 " / 3 @.@ 5 " floppy disk ) and South America ( e.g. <unk> <unk> and <unk> ) . In the Soviet Union , ZX Spectrum clones were assembled by thousands of small start @-@ ups and distributed through poster ads and street stalls . Over 50 such clone models existed . Some of them are still being produced , such as the Pentagon and ATM Turbo . 
 In the UK , Spectrum peripheral vendor Miles Gordon Technology ( MGT ) released the SAM Coupé as a potential successor with some Spectrum compatibility . By this point , the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST had taken hold of the market , leaving MGT in eventual receivership . 
 = = Peripherals = = 
 Several peripherals were marketed by Sinclair : the ZX Printer was already on the market , as the ZX Spectrum expansion bus was partially backwards @-@ compatible with that of the ZX81 . 
 The ZX Interface 1 add @-@ on module included 8 KB of ROM , an RS @-@ 232 serial port , a proprietary LAN interface ( called ZX Net ) , and an interface for the connection of up to eight ZX <unk> – somewhat unreliable but speedy tape @-@ loop cartridge storage devices released in July 1983 . These were used in a revised version on the Sinclair QL , whose storage format was electrically compatible but logically incompatible with the Spectrum 's . Sinclair also released the ZX Interface 2 which added two joystick ports and a ROM cartridge port . 
 There were a plethora of third @-@ party hardware <unk> . The better known of these included the Kempston joystick interface , the <unk> Peripherals <unk> / RS @-@ 232 interface , the Currah <unk> unit ( speech synthesis ) , <unk> <unk> , RAM pack , the Cheetah Marketing <unk> , a drum machine , and the <unk> , a snapshot and disassembly tool from Romantic Robot . Keyboards were especially popular in view of the original 's notorious " dead flesh " feel . 
 There were disk drive interfaces , such as the Abbeydale Designers / Watford Electronics <unk> , Abbeydale Designers / Kempston <unk> and Opus Discovery . The <unk> and <unk> interfaces were the first to come bundled with office productivity software ( Tasword Word Processor , Masterfile database and <unk> spreadsheet ) . This bundle , together with <unk> 's Stock Control , Finance and Payroll systems , introduced small businesses to a streamlined , computerised operation . The most popular floppy disk systems ( except in East Europe ) were the <unk> and + D systems released by Miles Gordon Technology in 1987 and 1988 respectively . Both systems had the ability to store memory images onto disk snapshots could later be used to restore the Spectrum to its exact previous state . They were both compatible with the Microdrive command syntax , which made porting existing software much simpler . 
 During the mid @-@ 1980s , <unk> Group Ltd launched a fee @-@ based service allowing users to connect their ZX Spectrums via a Prism Micro Products <unk> modem to a <unk> service known as <unk> 800 , hosted by <unk> , which provided news and information about microcomputers . The service allowed a form of instant messaging and online shopping . 
 = = Software = = 
 As of July 2012 , over 24 @,@ 000 titles had been released for the Spectrum family . While most of these are games , the library includes programming language implementations , databases ( e.g. VU @-@ File ) , word processors ( e.g. Tasword II ) , spreadsheets ( e.g. VU @-@ <unk> ) , drawing and painting tools ( e.g. <unk> Art Studio ) , and even 3D @-@ modelling ( e.g. VU @-@ 3D ) and archaeology software amongst many other types . 
 The early Spectrum models ' great success as a games platform came in spite of its lack of built @-@ in joystick ports , primitive sound generation , and colour support that was optimised for text display : the hardware limitations of the platform required a particular level of creativity from video game designers . 
 A simulation program called Evolution , commonly known as Foxes and Rabbits , came with the Spectrum . The logic was that too small a population of rabbits would provide insufficient food for foxes whose numbers would then decline , until too few foxes would result in the rabbit population again increasing , and the cycle would continue . One nominated a number of rabbits and number of foxes to start , then watched the basic graph of the two populations rising and falling . At any point in time , one could pause the simulation and save to the audio cassette by pressing ' Record ' on the connected remote tape recorder , then later resume the simulation on the Spectrum from that point . 
 According to the 90th issue of the British gaming magazine GamesMaster , the ten biggest games released were ( in descending order ) Head Over Heels , Jet Set Willy , Skool Daze , Renegade , R @-@ Type , Knight Lore , Dizzy , The Hobbit , Way Of The Exploding Fist , and Match Day 2 . 
 = = = Distribution = = = 
 Most Spectrum software was originally distributed on audio cassette tapes . The Spectrum was intended to work with a normal domestic cassette recorder , and despite differences in audio reproduction fidelity , the software loading process was quite reliable and faster than on competing systems of the time , but slow by modern standards . 
 Although the ZX Microdrive was initially greeted with good reviews , it never took off as a distribution method due to worries about the quality of the cartridges and piracy . Hence the main use became to complement tape releases , usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express , ( a tape to <unk> copying utility ) . No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive . 
 Although the Interface 2 proved popular , the high cost of ROM cartridges meant that very few titles were released in this format . 
 Despite the popularity of the <unk> and + D systems , most software released for them took the form of utility software . The ZX Spectrum + 3 enjoyed much more success when it came to commercial software releases on floppy disk . More than 700 titles were released on 3 @-@ inch disk from 1987 to 1997 . 
 Software was distributed through print media ; magazines and books . The reader would type the Sinclair BASIC program listing into the computer by hand , run it , and could save it to tape for later use . Software distributed in this way was in general simpler and slower than its assembly language counterparts . Magazines printed long lists of <unk> hexadecimal digits with machine code games or tools . 
 Another software distribution method was to broadcast the audio stream from the cassette on another medium and have users record it onto an audio cassette themselves . In radio or television shows in many European countries , the host would describe a program , instruct the audience to connect a cassette tape recorder to the radio or TV and then broadcast the program over the airwaves in audio format . Some magazines distributed 7 " 33 ⅓ rpm <unk> records , a variant of regular vinyl records which could be played on a standard record player . These disks were known under various trademarked names including " Floppy ROM " , " <unk> " , and " <unk> " . 
 = = = <unk> and backup = = = 
 Many copiers — utilities to copy programs from audio tape to another tape , <unk> tapes , and later on diskettes — were available for the Spectrum . As a response to this , publishers introduced copy protection measures to their software , including different loading schemes . Other methods for copy prevention were also used including asking for a particular word from the documentation included with the game — often a novella such as the Silicon Dreams trilogy — or another physical device distributed with the software — e.g. Lenslok as used in Elite , or the colour @-@ code chart included with Jet Set Willy . Special hardware , such as Romantic Robot 's <unk> , was able to dump a copy of the ZX Spectrum RAM to disk / tape at the press of a button , entirely circumventing the copy protection systems . 
 Most Spectrum software has been converted to current media and is available for download . One popular program for converting Spectrum files from tape is Taper ; it allows connecting a cassette tape player to the line in port of a sound card , or — through a simple home @-@ built device — to the parallel port of a PC . Once in files on a host machine , the software can be executed on an emulator . 
 The largest on @-@ line archive of ZX Spectrum software is World of Spectrum , with more than 21 @,@ 000 titles . The legality of this practice is in question and although a number of copyright holders have explicitly objected to the posting of their software , others have given their permission for their games to be archived as part of the preservation project . 
 = = = Community = = = 
 The ZX Spectrum enjoyed a very strong community early on . Several dedicated magazines were released including Sinclair User ( 1982 ) , Your Spectrum ( 1983 ) , rebranded as Your Sinclair in 1986 , and CRASH ( 1984 ) . Early on they were very technically oriented with type @-@ in programs and machine code tutorials . Later on they became almost completely game @-@ oriented . Several general contemporary computer magazines covered the ZX Spectrum in more or less detail . They included Computer Gamer , Computer and Video Games , Computing Today , Popular Computing Weekly , Your Computer and The Games Machine . 
 The Spectrum is affectionately known as the <unk> by elements of its fan following . 
 More than 80 electronic magazines existed , many in Russian . Most notable of them were <unk> ( UK ) , ZX @-@ Format ( Russia ) , Adventurer ( Russia ) and <unk> ( Russia ) . 
 = = = Notable developers = = = 
 A number of notable games developers began their careers on the ZX Spectrum , including David Perry of Shiny Entertainment , and Tim and Chris Stamper ( founders of Rare , formerly Ultimate Play The Game , maker of many games for Nintendo and Microsoft game consoles ) . Other prominent games developers include Julian Gollop ( Chaos , <unk> , X @-@ COM series ) , Matthew Smith ( Manic Miner , Jet Set Willy ) , Jon Ritman ( Match Day , Head Over Heels ) , Jonathan " <unk> " Smith ( Ping Pong , Batman : The Caped Crusader , <unk> , Hyper Sports ) , The Oliver Twins ( the Dizzy series ) , Clive Townsend ( Saboteur ) , Sandy White ( Ant Attack ; I , of the Mask ) , Pete Cooke ( Tau Ceti ) , Mike Singleton ( The Lords of Midnight , War In Middle Earth ) , and Alan Cox . Although the 48K Spectrum 's audio hardware was not as capable as chips in other popular 8 @-@ bit home computers of the era , computer musicians David Whittaker and Tim Follin produced notable multi @-@ channel music for it . 
 Jeff Minter ported some of his Commodore VIC @-@ 20 games to the ZX Spectrum .

 BYTE in January 1983 acknowledged the appeal of the Spectrum 's low £ 125 price to British consumers and called it a " promising machine " . It criticised the keyboard ; " inexpensive or not , the ... layout is impossible to justify ... poorly designed in several respects " . The review was skeptical of the computer 's appeal to American consumers if sold for US $ 220 — " hardly competitive with comparable low @-@ cost American units " — and expected that Timex would sell it for $ 125 – 150 .

 On 23 April 2012 , a Google doodle honoured the 30th anniversary of the Spectrum . As it coincided with St George 's Day , the logo was of St George fighting a dragon in the style of a Spectrum loading screen . 
 In January 2014 , Elite Systems , who produced a successful range of software for the original ZX Spectrum in the 1980s , announced plans for a Spectrum @-@ themed bluetooth keyboard that would attach to mobile devices such as the iPad . The company provided a crowdfunding campaign in order to fund the project , which would be compatible with games already released on iTunes and Google Play . Elite Systems took down its Spectrum Collection application the following month , due to complaints from authors of the original 1980s game software that they had not been paid for the content . Later that year , a £ 100 Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced by Retro Computers and crowdfunded on <unk> , with the apparent backing of Clive Sinclair as an investor , but without a full keyboard and manufactured in a limited capacity . 
 = The Pony Remark = 
 " The Pony Remark " is the second episode of the second season of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld , and the seventh episode overall . The episode was written by series co @-@ creators Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David , based on a remark David made once . 
 In this episode , Jerry , at a relative 's 50th anniversary dinner , makes a tactless remark about hating anybody who had a pony when they were a child . His remark upsets the female guest @-@ of @-@ honor , causing her to storm out in anger . When the woman dies shortly after the dinner , Jerry and his friends wonder if the pony remark had something to do with her death . 
 The episode featured the first appearance of Jerry 's uncle Leo ( Len Lesser ) , who became a recurring character on the show . The episode also featured the first appearance of Barney Martin as Morty Seinfeld , replacing actor Phil Bruns , who had portrayed Morty in the season 1 episode " The Stake Out " . " The Pony Remark " aired on January 30 , 1991 , and gained a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 7 / 16 . It gained positive responses from critics and The New York Times considers the episode a turning point for the show . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Jerry 's parents , Helen ( Liz Sheridan ) and Morty Seinfeld , are staying at Jerry 's apartment in New York City , making themselves at home . He bursts in , wearing baseball clothes , carrying a bat and glove , and proudly tells them that during his softball game , " I made an incredible play in the field ! There was a tag @-@ up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly ! We 'll be in the championship game Wednesday because of me . It was the single greatest moment in my life . " 
 Morty shares the reflected glory by remembering his own greatest moment ; he is sympathetic , but Helen reminds them that they are all going to the 50th anniversary dinner of Helen 's second cousin Manya ( <unk> Halmos ) and her husband Isaac ( David Fresco ) . Though Jerry does not want to go — he has made plans , he doesn 't know the people — his mother coerces him : " At least come and say hello , have a cup of coffee , then you 'll leave . " Jerry knows it won 't be that simple , so he persuades Elaine to attend , too . ( To their unspoken dismay , she is seated at the kiddie table , lower than the grown @-@ ups . ) 
 During the dinner , he makes the tactless comment to which the title refers : 
 <unk> : I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses . You know , trotters , like at Yonkers . 
 JERRY : Horses ? They 're like big riding dogs . 
 <unk> : What about ponies ? What kind of abnormal animal is that ? And those kids who had their own ponies ... 
 JERRY : I know , I hated those kids . In fact , I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up . 
 <unk> : ( angry ) I had a pony . 
 ( The room goes dead quiet . ) 
 JERRY : Well , I didn 't , uh , really mean a pony , per se ... 
 <unk> : When I was a little girl in Poland , we all had ponies . My sister had pony , my cousin had pony ... So , what 's wrong with that ? 
 Jerry tries to apologize , even going as far as to compare ponies with compact cars , but Manya gets even more angry and leaves the table . Just after she leaves , Jerry tries to reason with the others that he did not know she had a pony and wonders why immigrants with ponies would leave Europe to come to America without ponies ( " Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non @-@ pony country ? " ) After the dinner , when Jerry 's parents are leaving , his father soothes : " Hey , I agree with him . Nobody likes a kid with a pony . " But Jerry receives a phone call from Uncle Leo , who informs him that Manya has died . Jerry is very upset about it , but he 's also upset to learn that the funeral will be held on the same day of his softball championship . 
 At Monk 's Cafe , Jerry discusses the situation with George and Elaine . They speculate whether his comment may have been a factor , though both are self @-@ centered : Elaine wonders about her own death , and George urges Jerry to play in the softball game , because he thinks Jerry needs " to play left field " , as Jerry 's replacement fielder " stinks , " and , George adds , " I just don 't see what purpose is it gonna serve your going ? I mean , you think dead people care who 's at their funeral ? They don 't even know they 're having a funeral . " 
 Feeling guilty , Jerry ends up going to the funeral , where he , again , apologizes for his remark . Isaac informs him that Manya had forgotten Jerry made the pony remark : " Oh , no no no . She forgot all about that . She was much more upset about the potato salad . " Elaine asks Isaac multiple times about what is going to happen with their apartment . Isaac eventually tells her that Jerry 's cousin Jeffrey is going to live in it . When it starts to rain , Jerry realizes that the game will be postponed . The following day , after the game , Jerry , George and Elaine meet at Monk 's Cafe , where they discuss the lousy way Jerry played softball . ( Jerry recalls a certain play , about which he admits , " It was the single worst moment of my life . " ) Elaine wonders if Manya 's spirit put a spell on him . 
 In a subplot , Jerry and Kramer bet whether or not Kramer will rebuild his apartment so that it has multiple flat wooden levels instead of needing furniture . Kramer changes his mind and decides not to build levels , but refuses to pay Jerry , arguing that since he did not attempt it , the bet was invalid .

 This episode was written by series creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld , in their second episode for this season , and directed by Tom Cherones , also his second episode this season , during the course of the second production season . This episode was based on a remark David once made during a conversation . Cherones deliberately made Elaine sit at a smaller table while directing the dinner scene . " The Pony Remark " was the first episode in which Kramer wants to gamble , it is later established that he has a gambling addiction . The idea of Elaine asking Isaac what is going to happen with his old apartment was added during rehearsals . The first table reading of the episode was held on October 24 , 1990 , and a run through was held two days later . " The Pony Remark " was filmed in front of a live audience on October 30 , 1990 , while Seinfeld 's stand @-@ up routine was filmed one day earlier , along with the performances used in " The Ex @-@ Girlfriend " and " The Busboy " ; Seinfeld would change wardrobe between takes . 
 " The Pony Remark " featured the second appearance of Helen and Morty Seinfeld , who had previously appeared in the season 1 episode " The Stake Out " . In " The Stake Out " , Morty was portrayed by Phil Bruns ; however , David and Seinfeld decided they wanted the character to be harsher , and re @-@ cast him with Barney Martin , who auditioned for the part on October 15 , 1990 at 12 @.@ 45 PM . Martin was unaware that another actor had already established the part . Helen was portrayed by Liz Sheridan ; in an early draft of the episode , her name was Adele , though this did not match her name from " The Stake Out " . It was later changed back to Helen . The episode also introduced Jerry 's uncle Leo , portrayed by Len Lesser , who was known for his acting in gangster films , and also The Outlaw Josey Wales and Kelly 's Heroes . When Lesser auditioned for the part on October 22 , 1990 , he got a lot of laughs from David , Seinfeld and casting director Marc <unk> , but did not understand why , because he did not think his lines were funny . <unk> stated that Lesser was the right actor for the part when Lesser had auditioned . David Fresco guest starred in the episode as Isaac . Fresco had some difficulty with his lines in the episode , and would sometimes burst into laughter during filming . Other actors who guest @-@ starred in the episode were <unk> Halmos , who portrayed Manya , and Milt Oberman , who played the funeral director .

 On January 30 , 1991 , " The Pony Remark " was first broadcast on American television . It gained a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 7 and an audience share of 16 . This means that 10 @.@ 7 % of American households watched the episode , and that 16 % of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it . The episode gained two Primetime Emmy Award nominations ; Seinfeld and David were nominated for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series and Cherones was nominated for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series . Though the episode did not win either of its Emmy nominations , Seinfeld was praised for co @-@ hosting the Emmy telecast . 
 Dave Kehr of The New York Times felt that " The Pony Remark " was a turning point for the show , stating that , after the first few episodes , the show " turn [ ed ] into something sharp and distinctive [ ... ] Here , suddenly , is the tight knot of guilt and denial , of hypersensitivity and sarcastic contempt that Seinfeld would explore for the next eight years . " Holly Ordway of DVD Talk considered the episode the best episode of Seinfeld 's second season . " The Pony Remark " is considered one of Seinfeld 's " classic episodes " . Writing for Entertainment Weekly , critics Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling called the episode " Seinfeld at its mordant best " and graded it with an A- . 
 In the book Something Ain 't Kosher Here : The Rise of the " Jewish " Sitcom , Vincent Brook analysed the episode , saying , " Jerry is made to feel guilty for his ' lethal ' pony remark , whence the episode 's macabre humor ; yet the moral in terms of ethno @-@ spatial identity is clear . In its violent rejection of Manya , Seinfeld has driven descent @-@ based ethnicities ( and their legacy of privation and self @-@ sacrifice ) off the face of the earth , and literally off the air . There is no place for traditional Jewishness in the hedonistic Seinfeld world , " The Pony Remark " vociferously proclaims . " 
 David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A , calling it a " classic " and writing that it " is so damn clever in how it bonds Jerry 's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality " ; he also praised Louis @-@ Dreyfus 's acting , saying that Elaine " has an amusingly stark little bit of dialogue about death midway through the episode : " You know , funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I 'm actually going to die someday . Me , dead . Imagine that ! " I think it 's probably Louis @-@ Dreyfus ' best moment of the show so far , because she 's really starting to nail Elaine 's declarative , vaguely imperious , self @-@ centered tone . " He also admired " the estimable Barney Martin in his first appearance as Jerry 's irascible dad . " 
 = M @-@ 65 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 65 is a 103 @.@ 176 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 166 @.@ 046 km ) state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan . The highway runs between termini on US Highway 23 ( US 23 ) near Omer and Rogers City in the northeastern Lower Peninsula of the state . M @-@ 65 runs inland through several small communities in the region , passing through forests and fields along its course . M @-@ 65 crosses several watercourses , including the Au Sable River where it runs along the River Road National Scenic Byway . The region also includes the Huron National Forest and the Mackinaw State Forest areas . 
 The original M @-@ 65 was created by 1919 on a discontinuous series of roads between the Ohio state line and Flint ; the two sections were later joined together before the highway was replaced by US 23 in 1926 . The current M @-@ 65 was created in 1930 in Iosco County . When US 23 near Omer was moved in 1932 , M @-@ 65 was extended southward to encompass a roadway formerly part of US 23 . A second segment in Alpena County was added to M @-@ 65 later in the 1930s . A second extension at the end of that decade added another former US 23 segment to the highway . The two sections of M @-@ 65 were connected in the late 1940s , and the highway was completely paved by the early 1960s . The National Forest Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway designations were added in 1988 and 2005 respectively . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 65 begins at an intersection with US 23 ( Huron Road ) near the town of Omer . The highway runs north along Hale Road through a mixed forest and agricultural area inland of the Saginaw Bay in Arenac County . As the road passes through the community of Twining , it crosses a branch of the Lake State Railway . South of Whittemore , the trunkline crosses a tributary of the Au Gres River . M @-@ 65 follows Bullock Street through Whittemore , running near the Whittemore Speedway in town . North of town , the highway crosses the main channel of the Au Gres River before it intersects M @-@ 55 in a rural area of Iosco County about 15 miles ( 24 km ) west of Tawas City . From there , the road continues due north through fields until reaching the edge of Huron National Forest in the northern part of the county . 
 Just north of the community of Hale the road enters the Huron National Forest near Loon Lake . The trunkline takes a turn to the east as it passes along the Au Sable River . The River Road National Scenic Byway starts on M @-@ 65 at <unk> Road , and the highway generally follows the river as it passes by a former logging community which is commemorated by Lumberman 's Monument . At the intersection with River Road , M @-@ 65 turns north to cross the Au Sable , and the byway designation continues east along River Road to follow the river to Oscoda . The M @-@ 65 bridge over the Au Sable is just downstream of the Cooke Dam , crossing high above the water below . The highway turns northwesterly through forest land to cross into Alcona County . North of the county line , the trunkline follows Baker and State roads near Vaughn and Hunters lakes . M @-@ 65 meets the western terminus of county road F @-@ 30 in the community of Glennie . The highway also crosses the South Branch of the Pine River . 
 North of Glennie , the highway passes Clear Lake as it continues through rural Alcona County . Near the West Branch of the Pine River , M @-@ 65 merges with M @-@ 72 . The two trunklines run concurrently curving to the northwest past the eastern terminus of county road F @-@ 32 into Curran . North of town , they separate as M @-@ 72 turns westward and M @-@ 65 continues north , exiting the Huron National Forest . The highway jogs along the Alcona – Alpena County line and crosses the Beaver Creek in the process . The trunkline runs to the east of Beaver Lake as it runs north through mixed forest and fields toward the community of Lachine . Southeast of that town , M @-@ 65 turns eastward along M @-@ 32 for a short distance before turning north into town . North of Lachine , the highway crosses the Thunder Bay River near the community of Long Rapids . As M @-@ 65 runs through the northern portion of Alpena County , it runs through the Mackinaw State Forest . The highway passes through the community of Posen in eastern Presque Isle County . The road continues due north to its terminus at an intersection with US 23 ; the junction is inland from Lake Huron near Big and Little Trout lakes southeast of Rogers City . 
 M @-@ 65 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like all other state highways . As a part of these responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic using the roads under its jurisdiction . They use a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . In 2009 , MDOT 's surveys calculated that the highest volume of traffic along M @-@ 65 was 6 @,@ 699 cars north of the M @-@ 55 junction ; the highest commercial AADT was 310 trucks along the River Road National Scenic Byway segment north to the F @-@ 30 junction in Glennie . The lowest traffic counts were the 947 cars and 107 trucks near the northern terminus in Presque Isle County . The section of M @-@ 65 concurrent with M @-@ 32 has been listed as a part of the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 On July 1 , 1919 , the M @-@ 65 designation was used on two , discontinuous roads in the southern part of the Lower Peninsula . The southern segment ran from the Ohio state line north to the Dundee area in Monroe County ; the northern section ran between Ann Arbor and Flint by way of Brighton and Fenton . The gap between the two segments was eliminated by the middle of 1926 . When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , the original M @-@ 65 was redesignated as part of US 23 . 
 = = = Current routing = = = 
 In 1930 , the first segment of the current routing of M @-@ 65 was designated . At the time , the road ran from an intersection with US 23 and M @-@ 55 near Whittemore and ran north to Hale . US 23 was moved from its inland routing to follow a shoreline alignment along Saginaw Bay around 1932 . The former route through Twinning and Whittemore became an extension of M @-@ 65 as a part of these changes . By 1936 , the highway was lengthened northwards to end in Glennie ; a second segment was also added that ran north from the Alcona – Alpena county line to Lachine . Around the end of the decade , US 23 's routing was moved in another location to follow the lakeshore ; this time the highway was rerouted between Alpena and Rogers City . M @-@ 65 was extended northwards from Lachine through Posen to terminate at M @-@ 91 downtown Rogers City . By 1945 , this northernmost segment downtown was redesignated Business US 23 , and M @-@ 65 was truncated to its junction with US 23 southeast of town . 
 In 1947 or early 1948 , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) closed the gap between the northern and southern segments of M @-@ 65 by adding two " earth " roadways : one between Glennie and M @-@ 72 near Curran and a second between Curran and the Alcona – Alpena county line . By the next year , the northern end of the highway near Posen was moved to eliminate several zig @-@ zagging segments of roadway from the routing ; M @-@ 65 ran due north to terminate at US 23 after the change . In the middle of 1953 , the section of M @-@ 65 / M @-@ 72 in Alcona County was straightened and paved . The MSHD realigned M @-@ 65 from a series of zig @-@ zagging roads to a single set of curves along the Alcona – Alpena county line in late 1961 . At the time this project was completed , all of M @-@ 65 was paved . 
 On December 20 , 1988 , the National Forest Service designated the River Road National Forest Scenic Byway along a section of M @-@ 65 in Iosco County . A second designation was added on September 22 , 2005 , when the Federal Highway Administration listed the roadway as the River Road National Scenic Byway . 
 Beginning in 1999 , MDOT spent substantial sums of money over a five @-@ year program to upgrade M @-@ 65 and US 23 by refurbishing and replacing bridges and adding more passing lanes . During the same timeframe , the community of Hale embarked on a project to beautify the length of M @-@ 65 in town . The project cost $ 877 @,@ 929 and installed park benches , new lighting , sidewalks and plantings along the highway . Funding for the venture came from the federal government and MDOT . 
 In particular , MDOT restored the old truss bridge over the Au Sable River in Iosco County , and then built a new parallel and upgraded bridge next to it . The latter straightened and leveled the roadway , so that it no longer dips deep into the river valley . This change improved the safety of the highway in the area . The new bridge was opened to traffic on October 13 , 2004 , and the original bridge was left in place for recreational uses . The original structure is a Parker truss bridge with two 120 @-@ foot ( 37 m ) spans that was built in 1930 . Its total length of 320 feet ( 98 m ) makes it one of the longest of its type in Michigan .

 = Giuseppe Verdi = 
 Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi ( Italian : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 9 or 10 October 1813 – 27 January 1901 ) was an Italian opera composer . 
 Verdi was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means , and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron . Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Bellini , Donizetti and Rossini , whose works significantly influenced him , becoming one of the pre @-@ eminent opera composers in history . 
 In his early operas Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the Risorgimento movement which sought the unification of Italy . He also participated briefly as an elected politician . The chorus " Va , pensiero " from his early opera Nabucco ( 1842 ) , and similar choruses in later operas , were much in the spirit of the unification movement , and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals . An intensely private person , Verdi however did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements and as he became professionally successful was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region . He surprised the musical world by returning , after his success with the opera Aida ( 1871 ) , with three late masterpieces : his Requiem ( 1874 ) , and the operas Otello ( 1887 ) and Falstaff ( 1893 ) . 
 His operas remain extremely popular , especially the three peaks of his ' middle period ' : Rigoletto , Il trovatore and La traviata , and the bicentenary of his birth in 2013 was widely celebrated in broadcasts and performances . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Childhood and education = = = 
 Verdi , the first child of Carlo Giuseppe Verdi ( 1785 – 1867 ) and Luigia <unk> ( 1787 – 1851 ) , was born at their home in Le <unk> , a village near Busseto , then in the <unk> Taro and within the borders of the First French Empire following the annexation of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza in 1808 . The baptismal register , prepared on 11 October 1813 , lists his parents Carlo and Luigia as " innkeeper " and " spinner " respectively . Additionally , it lists Verdi as being " born yesterday " , but since days were often considered to begin at sunset , this could have meant either 9 or 10 October . Verdi himself , following his mother , always celebrated his birthday on 9 October . 
 Verdi had a younger sister , <unk> , who died aged 17 in 1833 . From the age of four , Verdi was given private lessons in Latin and Italian by the village schoolmaster , <unk> , and at six he attended the local school . After learning to play the organ , he showed so much interest in music that his parents finally provided him with a spinet . Verdi 's gift for music was already apparent by 1820 – 21 when he began his association with the local church , serving in the choir , acting as an altar boy for a while , and taking organ lessons . After <unk> 's death , Verdi , at the age of eight , became the official paid organist . 
 The music historian Roger Parker points out that both of Verdi 's parents " belonged to families of small landowners and traders , certainly not the illiterate peasants from which Verdi later liked to present himself as having emerged ... Carlo Verdi was energetic in furthering his son 's education ... something which Verdi tended to hide in later life ... [ T ] he picture emerges of youthful precocity eagerly nurtured by an ambitious father and of a sustained , sophisticated and elaborate formal education . " 
 In 1823 , when he was 10 , Verdi 's parents arranged for the boy to attend school in Busseto , enrolling him in a Ginnasio — an upper school for boys — run by Don Pietro <unk> , while they continued to run their inn at Le <unk> . Verdi returned to Busseto regularly to play the organ on Sundays , covering the distance of several kilometres on foot . At age 11 , Verdi received schooling in Italian , Latin , the humanities , and rhetoric . By the time he was 12 , he began lessons with Ferdinando Provesi , maestro di cappella at San Bartolomeo , director of the municipal music school and co @-@ director of the local Società Filarmonica ( Philharmonic Society ) . Verdi later stated : " From the ages of 13 to 18 I wrote a motley assortment of pieces : marches for band by the hundred , perhaps as many little <unk> that were used in church , in the theatre and at concerts , five or six concertos and sets of variations for pianoforte , which I played myself at concerts , many serenades , cantatas ( arias , duets , very many trios ) and various pieces of church music , of which I remember only a Stabat Mater . " This information comes from the Autobiographical Sketch which Verdi dictated to the publisher Giulio Ricordi late in life , in 1879 , and remains the leading source for his early life and career . Written , understandably , with the benefit of hindsight , it is not always reliable when dealing with issues more contentious than those of his childhood . 
 The other director of the Philharmonic Society was Antonio Barezzi , a wholesale grocer and distiller , who was described by a contemporary as a " manic dilettante " of music . The young Verdi did not immediately become involved with the Philharmonic . By June 1827 , he had graduated with honours from the Ginnasio and was able to focus solely on music under Provesi . By chance , when he was 13 , Verdi was asked to step in as a replacement to play in what became his first public event in his home town ; he was an immediate success mostly playing his own music to the surprise of many and receiving strong local recognition . 
 By 1829 – 30 , Verdi had established himself as a leader of the Philharmonic : " none of us could rival him " reported the secretary of the organisation , Giuseppe <unk> . An eight @-@ movement cantata , I <unk> di Saul , based on a drama by Vittorio Alfieri , was written by Verdi when he was 15 and performed in Bergamo . It was acclaimed by both <unk> and Barezzi , who commented : " He shows a vivid imagination , a philosophical outlook , and sound judgment in the arrangement of instrumental parts . " In late 1829 , Verdi had completed his studies with Provesi , who declared that he had no more to teach him . At the time , Verdi had been giving singing and piano lessons to Barezzi 's daughter Margherita ; by 1831 , they were unofficially engaged . 
 Verdi set his sights on Milan , then the cultural capital of northern Italy , where he applied unsuccessfully to study at the Conservatory . Barezzi made arrangements for him to become a private pupil of Vincenzo Lavigna , who had been maestro <unk> at La Scala , and who described Verdi 's compositions as " very promising . " Lavigna encouraged Verdi to take out a subscription to La Scala , where he heard Maria Malibran in operas by Gioachino Rossini and Vincenzo Bellini . Verdi began making connections in the Milanese world of music that were to stand him in good stead . These included an introduction by Lavigna to an amateur choral group , the Società Filarmonica , led by Pietro Massini . Attending the Società frequently in 1834 , Verdi soon found himself functioning as rehearsal director ( for Rossini 's La <unk> ) and continuo player . It was Massini who encouraged him to write his first opera , originally titled Rocester , to a libretto by the journalist Antonio Piazza . 
 = = = 1834 – 42 : First operas = = = 
 In mid @-@ 1834 , Verdi sought to acquire Provesi 's former post in Busseto but without success . But with Barezzi 's help he did obtain the secular post of maestro di musica . He taught , gave lessons , and conducted the Philharmonic for several months before returning to Milan in early 1835 . By the following July , he obtained his certification from Lavigna . Eventually in 1835 Verdi became director of the Busseto school with a three @-@ year contract . He married Margherita in May 1836 , and by March 1837 , she had given birth to their first child , Virginia Maria Luigia on 26 March 1837 . <unk> Romano followed on 11 July 1838 . Both the children died young , Virginia on 12 August 1838 , <unk> on 22 October 1839 . 
 In 1837 , the young composer asked for Massini 's assistance to stage his opera in Milan . The La Scala impresario , Bartolomeo Merelli , agreed to put on Oberto ( as the reworked opera was now called , with a libretto rewritten by <unk> Solera ) in November 1839 . It achieved a respectable 13 additional performances , following which Merelli offered Verdi a contract for three more works . 
 While Verdi was working on his second opera Un giorno di regno , Margherita died of encephalitis at the age of 26 . Verdi adored his wife and children and was devastated by their deaths . Un giorno , a comedy , was premiered only a few months later . It was a flop and only given the one performance . Following its failure , it is claimed Verdi vowed never to compose again , but in his Sketch he recounts how Merelli persuaded him to write a new opera . 
 Verdi was to claim that he gradually began to work on the music for Nabucco , the libretto of which had originally been rejected by the composer Otto Nicolai : " This verse today , tomorrow that , here a note , there a whole phrase , and little by little the opera was written " , he later recalled . By the autumn of 1841 it was complete , originally under the title <unk> . Well received at its first performance on 9 March 1842 , Nabucco underpinned Verdi 's success until his retirement from the theatre , twenty @-@ nine operas ( including some revised and updated versions ) later . At its revival in La Scala for the 1842 autumn season it was given an unprecedented ( and later unequalled ) total of 57 performances ; within three years it had reached ( among other venues ) Vienna , Lisbon , Barcelona , Berlin , Paris and Hamburg ; in 1848 it was heard in New York , in 1850 in Buenos Aires . Porter comments that " similar accounts ... could be provided to show how widely and rapidly all [ Verdi 's ] other successful operas were disseminated . " 
 = = = 1842 – 49 = = = 
 A period of hard work for Verdi — with the creation of twenty operas ( excluding revisions and translations ) — followed over the next sixteen years , culminating in Un ballo in maschera . This period was not without its frustrations and setbacks for the young composer , and he was frequently demoralised . In April 1845 , in connection with I due Foscari , he wrote : " I am happy , no matter what reception it gets , and I am utterly indifferent to everything . I cannot wait for these next three years to pass . I have to write six operas , then addio to everything . " In 1858 Verdi complained : " Since Nabucco , you may say , I have never had one hour of peace . Sixteen years in the galleys . " 
 After the initial success of Nabucco , Verdi settled in Milan , making a number of influential acquaintances . He attended the <unk> Maffei , Countess Clara Maffei 's salons in Milan , becoming her lifelong friend and correspondent . A revival of Nabucco followed in 1842 at La Scala where it received a run of fifty @-@ seven performances , and this led to a commission from Merelli for a new opera for the 1843 season . I Lombardi alla prima <unk> was based on a libretto by Solera and premiered in February 1843 . Inevitably , comparisons were made with Nabucco ; but one contemporary writer noted : " If [ Nabucco ] created this young man 's reputation , I Lombardi served to confirm it . " 
 Verdi paid close attention to his financial contracts , making sure he was appropriately remunerated as his popularity increased . For I Lombardi and Ernani ( 1844 ) in Venice he was paid 12 @,@ 000 lire ( including supervision of the productions ) ; Attila and Macbeth ( 1847 ) , each brought him 18 @,@ 000 lire . His contracts with the publishers Ricordi in 1847 were very specific about the amounts he was to receive for new works , first productions , musical arrangements , and so on . He began to use his growing prosperity to invest in land near his birthplace . In 1844 he purchased Il <unk> , 62 acres ( 23 hectares ) of farmland with a farmhouse and outbuildings , providing a home for his parents from May 1844 . Later that year , he also bought the Palazzo Cavalli ( now known as the Palazzo <unk> ) on the via Roma , Busseto 's main street . In May 1848 , Verdi signed a contract for land and houses at Sant 'Agata in Busseto , which had once belonged to his family . It was here he built his own house , completed in 1880 , now known as the Villa Verdi , where he lived from 1851 until his death . 
 In March 1843 , Verdi visited Vienna ( where Gaetano Donizetti was musical director ) to oversee a production of Nabucco . The older composer , recognising Verdi 's talent , noted in a letter of January 1844 : " I am very , very happy to give way to people of talent like Verdi ... Nothing will prevent the good Verdi from soon reaching one of the most honourable positions in the cohort of composers . " Verdi travelled on to Parma , where the Teatro Regio di Parma was producing Nabucco with Strepponi in the cast . For Verdi the performances were a personal triumph in his native region , especially as his father , Carlo , attended the first performance . Verdi remained in Parma for some weeks beyond his intended departure date . This fuelled speculation that the delay was due to Verdi 's interest in Giuseppina Strepponi ( who stated that their relationship began in 1843 ) . Strepponi was in fact known for her amorous relationships ( and many illegitimate children ) and her history was an awkward factor in their relationship until they eventually agreed on marriage . 
 After successful stagings of Nabucco in Venice ( with twenty @-@ five performances in the 1842 / 43 season ) , Verdi began negotiations with the impresario of La Fenice to stage I Lombardi , and to write a new opera . Eventually , Victor Hugo 's <unk> was chosen , with Francesco Maria Piave as librettist . Ernani was successfully premiered in 1844 , and within six months had been performed at twenty other theatres in Italy , and also in Vienna . The writer Andrew Porter notes that for the next ten years , Verdi 's life " reads like a travel diary – a timetable of visits ... to bring new operas to the stage or to supervise local premieres . " La Scala premiered none of these new works , except for Giovanna d 'Arco . Verdi " never forgave the Milanese for their reception of Un giorno di regno . " 
 During this period , Verdi began to work more consistently with his librettists . He relied on Piave again for I due Foscari , performed in Rome in November 1844 , then on Solera once more for Giovanna d 'Arco , at La Scala in February 1845 , while in August that year he was able to work with Salvadore Cammarano on <unk> for the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples . Solera and Piave worked together on Attila for La Fenice ( March 1846 ) . 
 In April 1844 , Verdi took on Emanuele Muzio , eight years his junior , as a pupil and amanuensis . He had known him since about 1828 as another of Barezzi 's protégés . Muzio , who in fact was Verdi 's only pupil , became indispensable to the composer . He reported to Barezzi that Verdi " has a breadth of spirit , of generosity , a wisdom . " In November 1846 , Muzio wrote of Verdi : " If you could see us , I seem more like a friend , rather than his pupil . We are always together at dinner , in the cafes , when we play cards ... ; all in all , he doesn 't go anywhere without me at his side ; in the house we have a big table and we both write there together , and so I always have his advice . " Muzio was to remain associated with Verdi , assisting in the preparation of scores and transcriptions , and later conducting many of his works in their premiere performances in the USA and elsewhere outside Italy . He was chosen by Verdi as one of the executors of his will , but predeceased the composer in 1890 . 
 After a period of illness Verdi began work on Macbeth in September 1846 . He dedicated the opera to Barezzi : " I have long intended to dedicate an opera to you , as you have been a father , a benefactor and a friend for me . It was a duty I should have fulfilled sooner if imperious circumstances had not prevented me . Now , I send you Macbeth , which I prize above all my other operas , and therefore deem worthier to present to you . " In 1997 Martin Chusid wrote that Macbeth was the only one of Verdi 's operas of his " early period " to remain regularly in the international repertoire , although in the 21st century Nabucco has also entered the lists . 
 Strepponi 's voice declined and her engagements dried up in the 1845 to 1846 period , and she returned to live in Milan whilst retaining contact with Verdi as his " supporter , promoter , unofficial adviser , and occasional secretary " until she decided to move to Paris in October 1846 . Before she left Verdi gave her a letter that pledged his love . On the envelope , Strepponi wrote : " 5 or 6 October 1846 . They shall lay this letter on my heart when they bury me . " 
 Verdi had completed I <unk> for London by May 1847 except for the orchestration . This he left until the opera was in rehearsal , since he wanted to hear " la [ Jenny ] Lind and modify her role to suit her more exactly . " Verdi agreed to conduct the premiere on 22 July 1847 at Her Majesty 's Theatre , as well as the second performance . Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attended the first performance , and for the most part , the press was generous in its praise . 
 For the next two years , except for two visits to Italy during periods of political unrest , Verdi was based in Paris . Within a week of returning to Paris in July 1847 , he received his first commission from the Paris Opéra . Verdi agreed to adapt I Lombardi to a new French libretto ; the result was Jérusalem , which contained significant changes to the music and structure of the work ( including an extensive ballet scene ) to meet Parisian expectations . Verdi was awarded the Order of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour . To satisfy his contracts with the publisher Francesco Lucca , Verdi dashed off Il Corsaro . Budden comments " In no other opera of his does Verdi appear to have taken so little interest before it was staged . " 
 On hearing the news of the " Cinque <unk> " , the " Five Days " of street fighting that took place between 18 and 22 March 1848 and temporarily drove the Austrians out of Milan , Verdi travelled there , arriving on 5 April . He discovered that Piave was now " Citizen Piave " of the newly proclaimed Republic of San Marco . Writing a patriotic letter to him in Venice , Verdi concluded " <unk> every petty municipal idea ! We must all extend a fraternal hand , and Italy will yet become the first nation of the world ... I am drunk with joy ! Imagine that there are no more Germans here ! ! " 
 Verdi had been admonished by the poet Giuseppe Giusti for turning away from patriotic subjects , the poet pleading with him to " do what you can to nourish the [ sorrow of the Italian people ] , to strengthen it , and direct it to its goal . " Cammarano suggested adapting Joseph Méry 's 1828 play La Bataille de Toulouse , which he described as a story " that should stir every man with an Italian soul in his breast " . The premiere was set for late January 1849 . Verdi travelled to Rome before the end of 1848 . He found that city on the verge of becoming a ( short @-@ lived ) republic , which commenced within days of La battaglia di Legnano 's enthusiastically received premiere . In the spirit of the time were the tenor hero 's final words , " Whoever dies for the fatherland cannot be evil @-@ minded " . 
 Verdi had intended to return to Italy in early 1848 , but was prevented by work and illness , as well as , most probably , by his increasing attachment to Strepponi . Verdi and Strepponi left Paris in July 1849 , the immediate cause being an outbreak of cholera , and Verdi went directly to Busseto to continue work on completing his latest opera , Luisa Miller , for a production in Naples later in the year .

 Verdi was committed to the publisher Giovanni Ricordi for an opera — which became Stiffelio — for Trieste in the Spring of 1850 ; and , subsequently , following negotiations with La Fenice , developed a libretto with Piave and wrote the music for Rigoletto ( based on Victor Hugo 's Le roi s <unk> ) for Venice in March 1851 . This was the first of a sequence of three operas ( followed by Il trovatore and La traviata ) which were to cement his fame as a master of opera . The failure of Stiffelio ( attributable not least to the censors of the time taking offence at the taboo subject of the supposed adultery of a clergyman 's wife and interfering with the text and roles ) incited Verdi to take pains to rework it , although even in the completely recycled version of <unk> ( 1857 ) it still failed to please . Rigoletto , with its intended murder of royalty , and its sordid attributes , also upset the censors . Verdi would not compromise : 
 What does the sack matter to the police ? Are they worried about the effect it will produce ? ... Do they think they know better than I ? ... I see the hero has been made no longer ugly and hunchbacked ! ! Why ? A singing hunchback ... why not ? ... I think it splendid to show this character as outwardly deformed and ridiculous , and inwardly passionate and full of love . I chose the subject for these very qualities ... if they are removed I can no longer set it to music . 
 Verdi substituted a Duke for the King , and the public response and subsequent success of the opera all over Italy and Europe fully vindicated the composer . Aware that the melody of the Duke 's song " La donna è mobile " ( " Woman is fickle " ) would become a popular hit , Verdi excluded it from orchestral rehearsals for the opera , and rehearsed the tenor separately . 
 For several months Verdi was preoccupied with family matters . These stemmed from the way in which the citizens of Busseto were treating Giuseppina Strepponi , with whom he was living openly in an unmarried relationship . She was shunned in the town and at church , and while Verdi appeared indifferent , she was certainly not . Furthermore , Verdi was concerned about the administration of his newly acquired property at Sant 'Agata . A growing estrangement between Verdi and his parents was perhaps also attributable to Strepponi ( The suggestion that this situation was sparked by the birth of a child to Verdi and Strepponi which was given away as a foundling lacks any firm evidence ) . In January 1851 , Verdi broke off relations with his parents , and in April they were ordered to leave Sant 'Agata ; Verdi found new premises for them and helped them financially to settle into their new home . It may not be coincidental that all six Verdi operas written in the period 1849 – 53 ( La battaglia , Luisa Miller , Stiffelio , Rigoletto , Il trovatore and La traviata ) , have , uniquely in his oeuvre , heroines who are , in the opera critic Joseph Kerman 's words , " women who come to grief because of sexual transgression , actual or perceived " . Kerman , like the psychologist Gerald Mendelssohn , sees this choice of subjects as being influenced by Verdi 's uneasy passion for Strepponi . 
 Verdi and Strepponi moved into Sant 'Agata on 1 May 1851 . May also brought an offer for a new opera from La Fenice , which Verdi eventually realised as La traviata . That was followed by an agreement with the Rome Opera company to present Il trovatore for January 1853 . Verdi now had sufficient earnings to retire , should he have wished to do so . He had reached a stage where he could develop his operas as he wished , rather than be dependent on commissions from third parties . Il trovatore was in fact the first opera he wrote without a specific commission ( apart from Oberto ) . At around the same time he began to consider creating an opera from Shakespeare 's King Lear . After first ( 1850 ) seeking a libretto from Cammarano ( which never appeared ) , Verdi later ( 1857 ) commissioned one from Antonio Somma , but this proved intractable , and no music was ever written . Verdi began work on Il trovatore after the death of his mother in June 1851 . The fact that this is " the one opera of Verdi 's which focuses on a mother rather than a father " is perhaps related to her death . 
 In the winter of 1851 – 52 Verdi decided to go to Paris with Strepponi where he concluded an agreement with the Opéra to write what became Les vêpres siciliennes , his first original work in the style of grand opera . In February 1852 , the couple attended a performance of Alexander Dumas fils 's play , The Lady of the <unk> ; Verdi immediately began to compose music for what would later become La traviata . 
 After his visit to Rome for Il trovatore in January 1853 , Verdi worked on completing La traviata , but with little hope of its success , due to his lack of confidence in any of the singers engaged for the season . Furthermore , the management insisted that the opera be given a historical , not a contemporary setting . The premiere in March 1853 was indeed a failure : Verdi wrote : " Was the fault mine or the singers ' ? Time will tell . " Subsequent productions ( following some rewriting ) throughout Europe over the following two years fully vindicated the composer ; Roger Parker has written " Il trovatore consistently remains one of the three or four most popular operas in the Verdian repertoire : but it has never pleased the critics " . 
 = = = 1853 – 60 : Consolidation = = = 
 In the eleven years up to and including Traviata , Verdi had written sixteen operas . Over the next eighteen years ( up to Aida ) , he wrote only six new works for the stage . Verdi was happy to return to Sant 'Agata and , in February 1856 , was reporting a " total abandonment of music ; a little reading ; some light occupation with agriculture and horses ; that 's all " . A couple of months later , writing in the same vein to Countess Maffei he stated : " I 'm not doing anything . I don 't read . I don 't write . I walk in the fields from morning to evening , trying to recover , so far without success , from the stomach trouble caused me by I <unk> <unk> . Cursed operas ! " An 1858 letter by Strepponi to the publisher Léon Escudier describes the kind of lifestyle that increasingly appealed to the composer : " His love for the country has become a mania , madness , rage , and fury — anything you like that is exaggerated . He gets up almost with the dawn , to go and examine the wheat , the maize , the vines , etc .... Fortunately our tastes for this sort of life coincide , except in the matter of sunrise , which he likes to see up and dressed , and I from my bed . " 
 Nonetheless on 15 May , Verdi signed a contract with La Fenice for an opera for the following spring . This was to be Simon Boccanegra . The couple stayed in Paris until January 1857 to deal with these proposals , and also the offer to stage the translated version of Il trovatore as a grand opera . Verdi and Strepponi travelled to Venice in March for the premiere of Simon Boccanegra , which turned out to be " a fiasco " ( as Verdi reported , although on the second and third nights , the reception improved considerably ) . 
 With Strepponi , Verdi went to Naples early in January 1858 to work with Somma on the libretto of the opera Gustave III , which over a year later would become Un ballo in maschera . By this time , Verdi had begun to write about Strepponi as " my wife " and she was signing her letters as " Giuseppina Verdi " . Verdi raged against the stringent requirements of the Neapolitan censor stating : " I 'm drowning in a sea of troubles . It 's almost certain that the censors will forbid our libretto . " With no hope of seeing his Gustavo III staged as written , he broke his contract . This resulted in litigation and counter @-@ litigation ; with the legal issues resolved , Verdi was free to present the libretto and musical outline of Gustave III to the Rome Opera . There , the censors demanded further changes ; at this point , the opera took the title Un ballo in maschera . 
 Arriving in Sant 'Agata in March 1859 Verdi and Strepponi found the nearby city of Piacenza occupied by about 6 @,@ 000 Austrian troops who had made it their base , to combat the rise of Italian interest in unification in the Piedmont region . In the ensuing Second Italian War of Independence the Austrians abandoned the region and began to leave Lombardy , although they remained in control of the Venice region under the terms of the armistice signed at Villafranca . Verdi was disgusted at this outcome : " [ W ] here then is the independence of Italy , so long hoped for and promised ? ... Venice is not Italian ? After so many victories , what an outcome ... It is enough to drive one mad " he wrote to Clara Maffei . 
 Verdi and Strepponi now decided on marriage ; they travelled to Collonges @-@ sous @-@ <unk> , a village then part of Piedmont . On 29 August 1859 the couple were married there , with only the coachman who had driven them there and the church bell @-@ ringer as witnesses . At the end of 1859 , Verdi wrote to his friend Cesare De Sanctis " [ Since completing Ballo ] I have not made any more music , I have not seen any more music , I have not thought anymore about music . I don 't even know what colour my last opera is , and I almost don 't remember it . " He began to remodel Sant 'Agata , which took most of 1860 to complete and on which he continued to work for the next twenty years . This included major work on a square room that became his workroom , his bedroom , and his office . 
 = = = Politics = = = 
 Having achieved some fame and prosperity , Verdi began in 1859 to take an active interest in Italian politics . His early commitment to the Risorgimento movement is difficult to estimate accurately ; in the words of the music historian Philip Gossett " myths intensifying and exaggerating [ such ] sentiment began circulating " during the nineteenth century . An example is the claim that when the " Va , pensiero " chorus in Nabucco was first sung in Milan , the audience , responding with nationalistic fervour , demanded an encore . As encores were expressly forbidden by the government at the time , such a gesture would have been extremely significant . But in fact the piece encored was not " Va , pensiero " but the hymn " <unk> <unk> " . 
 The growth of the " identification of Verdi 's music with Italian nationalist politics " perhaps began in the 1840s . In 1848 , the nationalist leader Giuseppe Mazzini , ( whom Verdi had met in London the previous year ) requested Verdi ( who complied ) to write a patriotic hymn . The opera historian Charles Osborne describes the 1849 La battaglia di Legnano as " an opera with a purpose " and maintains that " while parts of Verdi 's earlier operas had frequently been taken up by the fighters of the Risorgimento ... this time the composer had given the movement its own opera " It was not until 1859 in Naples , and only then spreading throughout Italy , that the slogan " Viva Verdi " was used as an acronym for Viva Vittorio Emanuele Re D 'Italia ( Viva Victor Emmanuel King of Italy ) , ( who was then king of Sardinia ) . After Italy was unified in 1861 , many of Verdi 's early operas were increasingly re @-@ interpreted as Risorgimento works with hidden Revolutionary messages that perhaps had not been originally intended by either the composer or his librettists . 
 In 1859 , Verdi was elected as a member of the new provincial council , and was appointed to head a group of five who would meet with King Vittorio Emanuele II in Turin . They were enthusiastically greeted along the way and in Turin Verdi himself received much of the publicity . On 17 October Verdi met with Cavour , the architect of the initial stages of Italian unification . Later that year the government of Emilia was subsumed under the United Provinces of Central Italy , and Verdi 's political life temporarily came to an end . Whilst still maintaining nationalist feelings , he declined in 1860 the office of provincial council member to which he had been elected in absentia . Cavour however was anxious to convince a man of Verdi 's stature that running for political office was essential to strengthening and securing Italy 's future . The composer confided to Piave some years later that " I accepted on the condition that after a few months I would resign . " Verdi was elected on 3 February 1861 for the town of Borgo San <unk> ( <unk> ) to the Parliament of Piedmont @-@ Sardinia in Turin ( which from March 1861 became the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy ) , but following the death of Cavour in 1861 , which deeply distressed him , he scarcely attended . Later , in 1874 , Verdi was appointed a member of the Italian Senate , but did not participate in its activities . 
 = = = 1860 – 1887 : from La forza to Otello = = = 
 In the months following the staging of Ballo , Verdi was approached by several opera companies seeking a new work or making offers to stage one of his existing ones , but refused them all . But when , in December 1860 , an approach was made from Saint Petersburg 's Imperial Theatre , the offer of 60 @,@ 000 francs plus all expenses was doubtless a strong incentive . Verdi came up with the idea of adapting the 1835 Spanish play Don Alvaro o la <unk> del <unk> by Angel Saavedra , which became La forza del destino , with Piave writing the libretto . The Verdis arrived in St. Petersburg in December 1861 for the premiere , but casting problems meant that it had to be postponed . 
 Returning via Paris from Russia on 24 February 1862 , Verdi met two young Italian writers , the twenty @-@ year @-@ old Arrigo Boito and Franco <unk> . Verdi had been invited to write a piece of music for the 1862 International Exhibition in London , and charged Boito with writing a text , which became the Inno delle <unk> . Boito , as a supporter of the grand opera of Giacomo Meyerbeer and an opera composer in his own right , was later in the 1860s critical of Verdi 's " reliance on formula rather than form " , incurring the composer 's wrath . Nevertheless , he was to become Verdi 's close collaborator in his final operas . The St. Petersburg premiere of La forza finally took place in September 1862 , and Verdi received the Order of St. Stanislaus . 
 A revival of Macbeth in Paris in 1865 was not a success , but he obtained a commission for a new work , Don Carlos , based on the drama , Don Carlos by Friedrich Schiller . He and Giuseppina spent late 1866 and much of 1867 in Paris , where they heard , and did not warm to , Giacomo Meyerbeer 's last opera L 'Africaine , and Richard Wagner 's overture to Tannhäuser . The opera 's premiere in 1867 drew mixed comments . Whilst the critic Théophile Gautier praised the work , the composer Georges Bizet was disappointed at Verdi 's changing style : " Verdi is no longer Italian . He is following Wagner . " 
 During the 1860s and 1870s Verdi paid great attention to his estate around Busseto , purchasing additional land , dealing with unsatisfactory ( in one case , embezzling ) , stewards , installing irrigation , coping with variable harvests and economic slumps . In 1867 , both Verdi 's father Carlo , with whom he had restored good relations , and his early patron and father @-@ in @-@ law Antonio Barezzi , died . Verdi and Giuseppina decided to adopt Carlo 's great @-@ niece Filomena Maria Verdi , then seven years old , as their own child . She was to marry in 1878 the son of Verdi 's friend and lawyer Angelo Carrara and her family became eventually the heirs of Verdi 's estate . 
 Aida was commissioned by the Egyptian government for the opera house built by the Khedive Isma 'il Pasha to celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 . The opera house actually opened with a production of Rigoletto . The prose libretto in French by Camille du Locle , based on a scenario by the Egyptologist Auguste Mariette , was transformed to Italian verse by Antonio <unk> . Verdi was offered the enormous sum of 150 @,@ 000 francs for the opera ( even though he confessed that Ancient Egypt was " a civilization I have never been able to admire " ) , and it was first performed in Cairo in 1871 . Verdi spent much of 1872 and 1873 supervising the Italian productions of Aida at Milan , Parma and Naples , effectively acting as producer and demanding high standards and adequate rehearsal time . During the rehearsals for the Naples production he wrote his string quartet , the only chamber music by him to survive , and the only major work in the form by an Italian of the 19th century . 
 In 1869 , Verdi had been asked to compose a section for a requiem mass in memory of Gioachino Rossini . He compiled and completed the requiem , but its performance was abandoned ( and its premiere did not take place until 1988 ) . Five years later , Verdi reworked his " Libera Me " section of the Rossini Requiem and made it a part of his Requiem honouring Alessandro Manzoni , who had died in 1873 . The complete Requiem was first performed at the cathedral in Milan on the anniversary of Manzoni 's death on 22 May 1874 . The <unk> soprano Teresa Stolz ( 1834 – 1902 ) , who had sung in La Scala productions from 1865 onwards , was the soloist in the first and many later performances of the Requiem ; in February 1872 , she had created Aida in its European premiere in Milan . She became closely associated personally with Verdi ( exactly how closely remains conjectural ) , to Giuseppina Verdi 's initial disquiet ; but the women were reconciled and Stolz remained a companion of Verdi after Giuseppina 's death in 1897 until his own death . 
 Verdi conducted his Requiem in Paris , London and Vienna in 1875 and in Cologne in 1876 . It seemed that it would be his last work . In the words of his biographer John Rosselli , it " confirmed him as the unique presiding genius of Italian music . No fellow composer ... came near him in popularity or reputation " . Verdi , now in his sixties , initially seemed to withdraw into retirement . He deliberately shied away from opportunities to publicise himself or to become involved with new productions of his works , but secretly he began work on Otello , which Boito ( to whom the composer had been reconciled by Ricordi ) had proposed to him privately in 1879 . The composition was delayed by a revision of Simon Boccanegra which Verdi undertook with Boito , produced in 1881 , and a revision of Don Carlos . Even when Otello was virtually completed , Verdi teased " Shall I finish it ? Shall I have it performed ? Hard to tell , even for me . " As news leaked out , Verdi was pressed by opera houses across Europe with enquiries ; eventually the opera was triumphantly premiered at La Scala in February 1887 .

 Following the success of Otello Verdi commented , " After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines , I have at last the right to laugh a little . " He had considered a variety of comic subjects but had found none of them wholly suitable and confided his ambition to Boito . The librettist said nothing at the time but secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV , Part 1 and Part 2 . Verdi received the draft libretto probably in early July 1889 after he had just read Shakespeare 's play : " Benissimo ! Benissimo ! ... No one could have done better than you " , he wrote back to Boito . But he still had doubts : his age , his health ( which he admits to being good ) and his ability to complete the project : " If I were not to finish the music ? " . If the project failed , it would have been a waste of Boito 's time , and have distracted him from completing his own new opera . Finally on 10 July 1889 he wrote again : " So be it ! So let 's do Falstaff ! For now , let 's not think of obstacles , of age , of illnesses ! " Verdi emphasised the need for secrecy , but continued " If you are in the mood , then start to write . " Later he wrote to Boito ( capitals and exclamation marks are Verdi 's own ) : " What joy to be able to say to the public : HERE WE ARE <unk> ! ! ! COME AND SEE US ! " 
 The first performance of Falstaff took place at La Scala on 9 February 1893 . For the first night , official ticket prices were thirty times higher than usual . Royalty , aristocracy , critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present . The performance was a huge success ; numbers were encored , and at the end the applause for Verdi and the cast lasted an hour . That was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer , his wife and Boito arrived at the Grand Hotel de Milan . Even more hectic scenes ensued when he went to Rome in May for the opera 's premiere at the Teatro Costanzi , when crowds of well @-@ wishers at the railway station initially forced Verdi to take refuge in a tool @-@ shed . He witnessed the performance from the Royal Box at the side of King Umberto and the Queen . 
 In his last years Verdi undertook a number of philanthropic ventures , publishing in 1894 a song for the benefit of earthquake victims in Sicily , and from 1895 onwards planning , building and endowing a rest @-@ home for retired musicians in Milan , the Casa di <unk> per <unk> , and building a hospital at Villanova <unk> <unk> , close to Busseto . , His last major composition , the choral set of Four sacred pieces , was published in 1898 . In 1900 he was deeply upset at the assassination of King Umberto and sketched a setting of a poem in his memory but was unable to complete it . While staying at the Grand Hotel , Verdi suffered a stroke on 21 January 1901 . He gradually grew more feeble over the next week , during which Stolz cared for him , and died on 27 January at the age of 87 . 
 Verdi was initially buried in a private ceremony at Milan 's <unk> <unk> . A month later , his body was moved to the crypt of the Casa di <unk> . On this occasion , " Va , pensiero " from Nabucco was conducted by Arturo Toscanini with a chorus of 820 singers . A huge crowd was in attendance , estimated at 300 @,@ 000 . Boito wrote to a friend , in words which recall the mysterious final scene of Don Carlos , " [ Verdi ] sleeps like a King of Spain in his <unk> , under a bronze slab that completely covers him . " 
 = = Personality = = 
 Not all of Verdi 's personal qualities were amiable . John Rosselli concluded after writing his biography that " I do not very much like the man Verdi , in particular the autocratic rentier @-@ cum @-@ estate owner , part @-@ time composer , and seemingly full @-@ time <unk> and reactionary critic of the later years " , yet admits that like other writers , he must " admire him , warts and all ... a deep integrity runs beneath his life , and can be felt even when he is being unreasonable or wrong . " 
 Budden suggests that " With Verdi ... the man and the artist on many ways developed side by side . " <unk> and awkward in society in his early years , " as he became a man of property and underwent the civilizing influence of Giuseppina , ... [ he ] acquired assurance and authority . " He also learnt to keep himself to himself , never discussing his private life and maintaining when it suited his convenience legends about his supposed ' peasant ' origins , his materialism and his indifference to criticism . Mendelsohn describes the composer as " an intensely private man who deeply resented efforts to inquire into his personal affairs . He regarded journalists and would @-@ be biographers , as well as his neighbors in Busseto and the operatic public at large , as an intrusive lot , against whose prying attentions he needed constantly to defend himself . " 
 Verdi was similarly never explicit about his religious beliefs . Anti @-@ clerical by nature in his early years , he nonetheless built a chapel at Sant 'Agata , but is rarely recorded as going to church . Strepponi wrote in 1871 " I won 't say [ Verdi ] is an atheist , but he is not much of a believer . " Rosselli comments that in the Requiem " The prospect of Hell appears to rule ... [ the Requiem ] is troubled to the end , " and offers little consolation .

 The writer Friedrich Schiller ( four of whose plays were adapted as operas by Verdi ) distinguished two types of artist in his 1795 essay On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry . The philosopher Isaiah Berlin ranked Verdi in the ' naïve ' category – " They are not ... self @-@ conscious . They do not ... stand aside to contemplate their creations and express their own feelings .... They are able ... if they have genius , to embody their vision fully . " ( The ' <unk> ' seek to recreate nature and natural feelings on their own terms – Berlin instances Wagner – " offering not peace , but a sword . " ) Verdi 's operas are not written according to an aesthetic theory , or with a purpose to change the tastes of their audiences . In conversation with a German visitor in 1887 he is recorded as saying that , whilst " there was much to be admired in [ Wagner 's operas ] Tannhäuser and Lohengrin ... in his recent operas [ Wagner ] seemed to be overstepping the bounds of what can be expressed in music . For him " philosophical " music was incomprehensible . " Although Verdi 's works belong , as Rosselli admits " to the most artificial of genres ... [ they ] ring emotionally true : truth and directness make them exciting , often hugely so . " 
 That is not to say his operas did not come as great innovations . What sounds to a modern listener as derivative of the bel canto , his first major success , Nabucco , came as a something entirely new . Never before had opera been so harmonically complex and direct . No longer was there the empty vocal display of the bel canto period composers . Granted , there is a significant amount of vocal fireworks , but they exist for the purpose of drama , not to show off singers . Aside from this , his use of the chorus was entirely new . Before Nabucco , an opera 's chorus was limited to be only a background voice , another instrument . In Nabucco , this is abolished ; he uses the chorus as character , to show the suffering and consensus of the people . The famous " Va , pensiero " is an example of this . 
 The first of his " big three " operas , Rigoletto , followed by La Traviata , and ending with Il Trovatore , also was revolutionary . In a letter to Rigoletto 's librettist , Francesco Maria Piave , he says , " I conceived Rigoletto almost without arias , without finales but only an unending string of duets . " And that it is . Rigoletto is one of , if not the earliest operas to abandon the traditional distinction between the sung aria , and the more speech @-@ like recitative . 
 After these three operas , his works took an increasing amount of time to finish , were significantly longer , and more masterfully orchestrated . 
 = = = Periods = = = 
 The earliest study of Verdi 's music , published in 1859 by the Italian critic Abraham Basevi , already distinguished four periods in Verdi 's music . The early , ' grandiose ' period , ended according to Basevi with La battaglia di Legnano ( 1849 ) , and a ' personal ' style began with the next opera Luisa Miller . These two operas are generally agreed today by critics to mark the division between Verdi 's ' early ' and ' middle ' periods . The ' middle ' period is felt to end with La traviata ( 1853 ) and Les vêpres siciliennes ( 1855 ) , with a ' late ' period commencing with Simon Boccanegra ( 1857 ) running through to Aida ( 1871 ) . The last two operas , Otello and Falstaff , together with the Requiem and the Four Sacred Pieces , then represent a ' final ' period . 
 = = = = Early period = = = = 
 Verdi was to claim in his Sketch that during his early training with Lavigna " I did nothing but canons and fugues ... No @-@ one taught me orchestration or how to handle dramatic music . " He is known to have written a variety of music for the Busseto Philharmonic society , including vocal music , band music and chamber works , ( and including an alternative overture to Rossini 's Barber of Seville ) but few of these works survive . ( He may have given instructions before his death to destroy his early works ) . 
 Verdi uses in his early operas ( and , in his own stylized versions , throughout his later work ) the standard elements of Italian opera content of the period , referred to by the opera writer Julian Budden as the ' Code Rossini ' , after the composer who established through his work and popularity the accepted templates of these forms ; they were also used by the composers dominant during Verdi 's early career , Bellini , Donizetti and Saverio Mercadante . Amongst the essential elements are the aria , the duet , the ensemble , and the finale sequence of an act . The aria format , centred on a soloist , typically involved three sections ; a slow introduction , marked typically cantabile or adagio , a tempo di mezzo which might involve chorus or other characters , and a <unk> , an opportunity for bravura singing for the soloist . The duet was similarly formatted . Finales , covering climactic sequences of action , used the various forces of soloists , ensemble and chorus , usually culminating with an exciting stretto section . Verdi was to develop these and the other formulae of the generation preceding him with increasing sophistication during his career . 
 The operas of the early period show Verdi learning by doing and gradually establishing mastery over the different elements of opera . Oberto is poorly structured , and the orchestration of the first operas is generally simple , sometimes even basic . The musicologist Richard Taruskin suggests " the most striking effect in the early Verdi operas , and the one most obviously allied to the mood of the Risorgimento , was the big choral number sung – crudely or sublimely , according to the ear of the beholder – in unison . The success of " Va , pensiero " in Nabucco ( which Rossini approvingly denoted as " a grand aria sung by sopranos , contraltos , tenors and basses " ) , was replicated in the similar " O Signor , dal <unk> natio " in I <unk> and in 1844 in the chorus " Si <unk> il Leon di <unk> " in Ernani , the battle hymn of the conspirators seeking freedom In I due Foscari Verdi first uses recurring themes identified with main characters ; here and in future operas the accent moves away from the ' oratorio ' characteristics of the first operas towards individual action and intrigue . 
 From this period onwards Verdi also develops his instinct for " <unk> " ( literally ' colour ' ) , a term which he used for characterising elements of an individual opera score – Parker gives as an example " the rising 6th that begins so many lyric pieces in Ernani " . Macbeth , even in its original 1847 version , shows many original touches ; characterization by key ( the Macbeths themselves generally singing in sharp keys , the witches in flat keys ) , a preponderance of minor key music , and highly original orchestration . In the ' dagger scene ' and the duet following the murder of Duncan , the forms transcend the ' Code Rossini ' and propel the drama in a compelling fashion . Verdi was to comment in 1868 that Rossini and his followers missed " the golden thread that binds all the parts together and , rather than a set of numbers without coherence , makes an opera . " <unk> was for Verdi this " golden thread " , an essential unifying factor in his works . 
 = = = = Middle period = = = = 
 The writer David Kimbell states that in Luisa Miller and Stiffelio ( the earliest operas of this period ) there appears to be a " growing freedom in the large scale structure ... and an acute attention to fine detail . " Others echo those feelings . Julian Budden expresses the impact of Rigoletto and its place in Verdi 's output as follows : " Just after 1850 at the age of 38 , Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with Rigoletto . The so @-@ called <unk> in music is finished . Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas , but in a totally new spirit . " One example of Verdi 's wish to move away from " standard forms " appears in his feelings about the structure of Il trovatore . To his librettist , Cammarano , Verdi plainly states in a letter of April 1851 that if there were no standard forms – " <unk> , duets , trios , choruses , finales , etc . ... and if you could avoid beginning with an opening chorus .... " , he would be quite happy . 
 Two external factors had their impacts on Verdi 's compositions of this period . One is that with increasing reputation and financial security he no longer needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill , had more freedom to choose his own subjects , and had more time to develop them according to his own ideas . In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas , compared with fourteen in the previous ten years . 
 Another factor was the changed political situation ; the failure of the 1848 revolutions led both to some diminution of the Risorgimento ethos ( at least initially ) and a significant increase in theatre censorship . This is reflected both in Verdi 's choices of plots dealing more with personal relationships than political conflict , and in a ( partly consequent ) dramatic reduction in the operas of this period in the number of choruses ( of the type which had first made him famous ) – not only are there on average 40 % fewer choruses in the ' middle ' period operas compared to the ' early ' period ' , but whereas virtually all the ' early ' operas commence with a chorus , only one ( Luisa Miller ) of the ' middle ' period operas begin this way . Instead , Verdi experiments with a variety of means – e.g. a stage band ( Rigoletto ) , an aria for bass ( Stiffelio ) , a party scene ( La traviata ) . Chusid also notes Verdi 's increasing tendency to replace full @-@ scale overtures with shorter orchestral introductions . Parker comments that La traviata , the last opera of the ' middle ' period , is " again a new adventure . It gestures towards a level of ' realism ' ... the contemporary world of waltzes pervades the score , and the heroine 's death from disease is graphically depicted in the music . " Verdi 's increasing command of musical highlighting of changing moods and relationships is exemplified in Act III of Rigoletto , where Duke 's flippant song " La donna è mobile " is followed immediately by the quartet " Bella <unk> dell 'amore " , contrasting the rapacious Duke and his <unk> with the ( concealed ) indignant Rigoletto and his grieving daughter . Taruskin asserts this is " the most famous ensemble Verdi ever composed . " 
 = = = = Late period = = = = 
 Chusid notes Strepponi 's description of the operas of the 1860s and 1870s as being " modern " whereas Verdi described the pre @-@ 1849 works as " the cavatina operas " , as further indication that " Verdi became increasingly dissatisfied with the older , familiar conventions of his predecessors that he had adopted at the outset of his career , " Parker sees a physical differentiation of the operas from Les vêpres siciliennes ( 1855 ) to Aida ( 1871 ) is that they are significantly longer , and with larger cast @-@ lists , than previous works . They also reflect a shift towards the French genre of grand opera , notable in more colorful orchestration , <unk> of serious and comic scenes , and greater spectacle . The opportunities of transforming Italian opera by utilising such resources appealed to him . For a commission from the Paris Opéra he expressly demanded a libretto from Eugène Scribe , the favorite librettist of Meyerbeer , telling him : " I want – in fact , I must have – a grandiose , impassioned and original subject . " The result was Les vêpres siciliennes , and the scenarios of Simon Boccanegra ( 1857 ) , Un ballo in maschera ( 1859 ) , La forza del destino ( 1862 ) , Don Carlos ( 1865 ) and Aida ( 1872 ) all meet the same criteria . Porter notes that Un ballo marks an almost complete synthesis of Verdi 's style with the grand opera hallmarks , such that " huge spectacle is not mere decoration but essential to the drama ... musical and theatrical lines remain taut [ and ] the characters still sing as warmly , passionately and personally as in Il trovatore . " 
 Aida marks a return to earlier days in many ways . The plot as in the first operas centers on love and heroism ; the music is relatively ' four @-@ square ' and oriented to sensation and spectacle . When the composer Ferdinand Hiller asked Verdi whether he preferred Aida or Don Carlos , Verdi replied that Aida had " more bite and ( if you 'll forgive the word ) , more theatricality . " During the rehearsals for the Naples production of Aida Verdi amused himself by writing his only string quartet , a sprightly work which shows in its last movement that he had not lost the skill for fugue @-@ writing that he had learned with Lavigna . 
 = = = = Final works = = = = 
 Verdi 's three last major works continued to show new development in conveying drama and emotion . The first to appear , in 1874 was his Requiem , scored for operatic forces but by no means an " opera in ecclesiastical dress " ( the words in which Hans von Bülow condemned it before even hearing it ) . Although in the Requiem Verdi puts to use many of the techniques he learned in opera , its musical forms and emotions are not those of the stage . Verdi 's tone painting at the opening of the Requiem is vividly described by the Italian composer Ildebrando Pizzetti , writing in 1941 : " in [ the words ] murmured by an invisible crowd over the slow swaying of a few simple chords , you straightaway sense the fear and sadness of a vast multitude before the mystery of death . In the [ following ] Et lux perpetuum the melody spreads it wings ... before falling back on itself ... you hear a sigh for consolation and eternal peace . " 
 By the time Otello premièred in 1887 , more than 15 years after Aida , the operas of Verdi 's ( predeceased ) contemporary Richard Wagner had begun their ascendancy in popular taste , and many sought or identified Wagnerian aspects in Verdi 's latest composition . Budden points out that there is little in the music of Otello that relates either to the verismo opera of the younger Italian composers , and little if anything which can be construed as a homage to the New German School . Nonetheless there is still much originality , building on the strengths which Verdi had already demonstrated ; the powerful storm which opens the opera in medias res , the recollection of the love duet of Act I in Otello 's dying words ( more an aspect of <unk> than leitmotif ) , imaginative touches of harmony in Iago 's " Era la <unk> " ( Act II ) . 
 Finally , six years later , appeared Falstaff , Verdi 's only comedy apart from the early , ill @-@ fated Un giorno di regno . In this work Roger Parker writes that : " the listener is bombarded by a stunning diversity of rhythms , orchestral textures , melodic motifs and harmonic devices . Passages that in earlier times would have furnished material for an entire number here crowd in on each other , shouldering themselves unceremoniously to the fore in bewildering succession " . Rosselli comments : " In Otello Verdi had miniaturized the forms of romantic Italian opera ; in Falstaff he miniaturized himself ... [ M ] <unk> ... crystallize a feeling ... as though an aria or duet had been precipitated into a phrase . "

 Although Verdi 's operas brought him a popular following , not all contemporary critics approved of his work . The English critic Henry Chorley allowed in 1846 that " he is the only modern man ... having a style , – for better or worse " , but found all his output unacceptable . " [ His ] faults [ are ] grave ones , calculated to destroy and degrade taste beyond those of any Italian composer in the long list " wrote Chorley , whilst conceding that " howsoever incomplete may have been his training , howsoever mistaken his aspirations may have proved ... he has aspired . " But by the time of Verdi 's death , 55 years later , his reputation was assured , and the 1910 edition of Grove 's Dictionary pronounced him " one of the greatest and most popular opera composers of the nineteenth century . " 
 Verdi had no pupils apart from Muzio and no school of composers sought to follow his style which , however much it reflected his own musical direction , was rooted in the period of his own youth . By the time of his death , verismo was the accepted style of young Italian composers . The New York Metropolitan Opera frequently staged Rigoletto , Trovatore and Traviata during this period and featured Aida in every season from 1898 to 1945 . Interest in the operas reawakened in mid @-@ 1920s Germany and this sparked a revival in England and elsewhere . From the 1930s onward there began to appear scholarly biographies and publications of documentation and correspondence . 
 In 1959 the Instituto di Studi <unk> ( from 1989 the Istituto Nazionale di Studi <unk> ) was founded in Parma and became a leading centre for research and publication of Verdi studies , and in the 1970s the American Institute for Verdi Studies was founded at New York University .

 Three Italian conservatories , the Milan Conservatory and those in Turin and Como , are named after Verdi , as are many Italian theatres . 
 Verdi ’ s hometown of Busseto displays Luigi Secchi 's statue of a seated Verdi in 1913 , next to the Teatro Verdi built in his honour in the 1850s . It is one of many statues to the composer in Italy . The Giuseppe Verdi Monument , a 1906 marble memorial , sculpted by Pasquale Civiletti , is located in Verdi Square in Manhattan , New York City . The monument includes a statue of Verdi himself and life @-@ sized statues of four characters from his operas , ( Aida , Otello , and Falstaff from the operas of the same names , and Leonora from Il trovatore ) . 
 Verdi has been the subject of a number of film and stage works . These include the 1938 film directed by Carmine <unk> , Giuseppe Verdi , starring <unk> <unk> ; the 1982 miniseries , The Life of Verdi , directed by Renato Castellani , where Verdi was played by Ronald Pickup , with narration by Burt Lancaster in the English version ; and the 1985 play After Aida , by Julian Mitchell ( 1985 ) . He is a character in the 2011 opera Risorgimento ! by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero , written to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Italian unification of 1861 .

 Verdi 's operas are frequently staged around the world . The Operabase listings for 2013 – 2014 show La traviata as the most performed opera during this period ( 659 performances ) . Other Verdi operas in the top 20 are Rigoletto ( 8th place , 445 performances ) , Aida ( 12th place , 304 performances ) , Nabucco ( 16th place , 304 performances ) and Il trovatore ( 18th place , 232 performances ) . All of his operas are available in recordings in a number of versions , and on DVD – Naxos Records offers a complete boxed set . 
 Modern productions may differ substantially from those originally envisaged by the composer . Jonathan Miller 's 1982 version of Rigoletto for English National Opera , set in the world of modern American mafiosi , received critical plaudits . But the same company 's staging in 2002 of Un ballo in maschera as A Masked Ball , directed by Calixto Bieito , including " satanic sex rituals , homosexual rape , [ and ] a demonic dwarf " , got a general critical thumbs down . 
 Meanwhile , the music of Verdi can still evoke a range of cultural and political resonances . Excerpts from the Requiem were featured at the memorial service for Diana , Princess of Wales in 1997 . On 12 March 2011 during a performance of Nabucco at the Opera di Roma celebrating 150 years of Italian unification , the conductor Riccardo Muti paused after " Va pensiero " and turned to address the audience ( which included the then Italian Prime Minister , Silvio Berlusconi ) to complain about cuts in state funding of culture ; the audience then joined in a repeat of the chorus . In 2014 , the pop singer Katy Perry appeared at the Grammy Award wearing a dress designed by Valentino , embroidered with the music of " Dell <unk> <unk> e gia l <unk> " from the start of La traviata . The bicentenary of Verdi 's birth in 2013 was celebrated in numerous events around the world , both in performances and broadcasts .

 Noble , simple , with a degree of unbroken vitality and vast natural power of creation and organization , Verdi is the voice of a world that is no more . His enormous popularity among the most sophisticated as well as the most ordinary listeners today is due to the fact that he expressed permanent states of consciousness in the most direct terms : as Homer , Shakespeare , Ibsen , and Tolstoy have done ... After Verdi this is not heard in music again . – Isaiah Berlin ( 1979 ) 
 = Viva Ned Flanders = 
 " Viva Ned Flanders " is the tenth episode of The Simpsons ' tenth season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 10 , 1999 . In the episode , Ned Flanders , who is revealed to be 60 years old , feels that he has not lived his life to the fullest . He asks for help from his neighbor , Homer Simpson , who takes Ned to Las Vegas to show him " the right way to live " . However , while there , the two become intoxicated and marry two cocktail waitresses . 
 The episode was written by David M. Stern and directed by Neil Affleck . The revelation of Ned 's age was heavily debated between the Simpsons staff , and the decision to make him 60 years old could have been inspired from a joke by Simpsons writer Ron Hauge . A scene in the episode features the song Viva Las Vegas by Elvis Presley , although the staff originally wanted a version of the song performed by Bruce Springsteen . The Moody Blues guest @-@ starred as themselves in the episode , and the episode marked the first appearance of the cocktail waitresses Amber and Ginger , who were voiced by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille . 
 The episode was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program ( For Programming less than One Hour ) in 1999 , which it ultimately lost to King of the Hill . Following the tenth season 's release on DVD , the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics . Amber and Ginger have appeared in later episodes in the series , the first time being the season 13 episode " Brawl in the Family " , which serves as a continuation of " Viva Ned Flanders " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Mr. Burns ' Casino is about to get demolished , however , a confusion over whether demolitions are supposed to involve implosions or explosions results in the casino being blasted into a huge dust cloud . The family goes to the car wash to get rid of the dust , and when Homer is there , he sees that Ned Flanders gets a senior discount . Homer thinks Ned is lying and tries to expose him at church , but Ned proves he really is sixty years old . People are impressed that Ned looks so young for his age and remark that he must take exceptional care of himself , but when Ned says that he follows the three " c " s of success — clean living , chewing thoroughly , and " a daily dose of vitamin Church ! " — they start to pity him for having never , in their view , truly lived at all . 
 Ned reluctantly agrees with this and asks Homer to teach him the secret to his lust for life . This leads Homer to head towards Mr. Burns ' Casino , but when Ned reminds Homer it is now defunct , Homer instead takes Ned on a gambling trip to Las Vegas . Homer is confident about going there , but Flanders is nervous . When they arrive , they see Captain Lance Murdock ( from " Bart the Daredevil " ) doing one of his stunts , and Homer chooses to volunteer , and survives . They wander into a casino called " Nero 's Palace " and begin to play roulette . Ned protests against games of chance because of Deuteronomy 7 , but Homer ignores him and takes the reference as a lucky number . They win , but immediately lose all they won . They then go to the casino 's bar , and Ned gives into temptation and gets drunk of wine <unk> . Homer and Ned wake up the next morning in their hotel room married to two cocktail waitresses : Homer 's new wife is named Amber , and Ned 's new wife is Ginger . Homer finally realizes he got in over his head . While Homer fantasizes about bigamy , Ned snaps Homer back to reality by saying they were drunk and thus not of sound judgement to have such quickie , plastic weddings ; also they are already married . 
 Homer and Ned try to escape from the waitresses , going on a wild rampage through the casino , until they are confronted by casino security , Gunter and Ernst ( also from " $ pringfield " ) , Drederick Tatum , Boomhauer , and the Moody Blues . Homer and Ned attempt to escape in a car , but are beaten up in the process and are exiled from Las Vegas . Amber & Ginger angrily tell the two never to marry them again . Homer and Ned head back to their real wives in Springfield by hitchhiking , only to be attacked by two hungry vultures on their way back , being heard screaming as the credits roll .

 " Viva Ned Flanders " was written by writer David M. Stern and directed by director Neil Affleck . It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on January 10 , 1999 . It was recorded in July 1998 . 
 The beginning of the episode shows Mr. Burns ' casino being demolished with implosion . In the DVD commentary for the episode , show runner Mike Scully stated that there was " a lot of talk " and news reports about implosions at the time . Only directly after the implosion do the on @-@ lookers realize the amount of dust that is unleashed . This is based on an observation by the writers , who noted that , when an implosion takes place , " everybody wants to be right next to them " , not realizing that dust and asbestos will " fly in the air " . In the DVD audio commentary for the episode , director Affleck stated that the scene was very complicated to animate , and took about " four or five takes " to get right . Scully thought that the implosion looked " fantastic " . 
 The revelation of Ned 's age was much discussed among the writers , and Scully stated that they argued over " how old they could get away with " , since Ned had " lived such a pure life " and had " taken such good care of himself " . The writers kept pitching for him to be older and older , eventually debating whether his age would be 57 or 58 . They then decided on 60 , an idea that could have come from Ron Hauge , one of the Simpsons writers . A few weeks before the discussions , after having found out that he was slightly older than the next oldest writer in the staff , Hauge had told one of the writers , in " the most serious reasonable " voice , that he was 60 years old . At the time , Hauge was " around 40 " years old . 
 The morning after having drunk extensively , Homer and Ned are seen sleeping , clothed , in a Jacuzzi . The staff discussed whether or not the two should wake up naked or clothed ; series creator Matt Groening , for example , wanted them to wake up naked , since it would " raise some questions " . During production , Affleck had drawn an alternate version of the scene , which would be based on his " extensive experience in the field of alcohol abuse " in his younger years . The scene would be in Ned 's point of view , and would show Homer 's open mouth half submerged in the Jacuzzi . Affleck described the alternate scene as being " a little bit Fellini @-@ esque " and therefore did not fit with The Simpsons style . Scully had also suggested that Ned would throw up on screen at the end of the scene , however the idea never came to fruition . 
 The song used during the chase scene in the casino is " Viva Las Vegas " , performed by Elvis Presley . Although he admitted that he has " nothing against Elvis " , Scully originally wanted to use a " hard to find " version of the song performed by Bruce Springsteen . However , Scully could not clear the version in time , and therefore had to resort to using Elvis ' version of the song . The episode features The Moody Blues as themselves . Scully commented that they were " very good actors " and " did a great job " . The episode also features the first appearance of Amber and Ginger , who were voiced by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille respectively . Real @-@ life commentator Don Rickles and fictional character Lance Murdock were both portrayed by series regular voice actor Dan Castellaneta , who plays Homer among many others in the series . 
 Affleck described the plot of the episode to have a " grotesque " and " burlesque " , yet " plausible " quality to it . In a scene in the episode , Homer , not knowing of Ned 's age , accuses Ned of defrauding a <unk> salesman . Affleck commented that the scene has " a touch of music @-@ hall " in it , as it turns , from a scene in church , to a " courtroom scene " . He also noted that Ned 's journey to Las Vegas can be compared to a Christian 's travel to the temple of Mammon , a figure that in the Bible is characterized as the personification of wealth and greed . 
 The episode 's title is a reference to the film Viva Las Vegas ( 1964 ) . The panic and smoke cloud generated from the implosion of Mr Burns ' casino is reminiscent of the 1997 disaster film Dante 's Peak , and the Simpson family 's escape from the smoke cloud is a reference to a scene in the 1996 science fiction film Independence Day . Outside Rev. Lovejoy 's church is a notice that today 's sermon will be ' He Knows What You Did Last Summer ' , which is a reference to the title of the 1997 slasher film I Know What You Did Last Summer . As Homer and Ned escape from Vegas , a snippet of the theme from the 1996 comic science fiction film Mars Attacks ! can be heard . The Comic Book Guy 's license plate is NCC @-@ 1701 , which is also the registration of the USS Enterprise , a fictional starship from the Star Trek media franchise . He also has a bumper sticker which reads " my other car is the Millennium Falcon " which was given to him by somebody who looked liked the actor Harrison Ford ; the Millennium Falcon was the ship used by Ford 's character Han Solo in the Star Wars film series . The line Homer gives after Ned signs the contract is a reference to the 1997 film The Game . 
 The song Homer and Ned listen to on the way to Las Vegas is “ Highway Star ” by English rock band Deep Purple . The two characters driving the other way from Las Vegas were based on Ralph Steadman 's illustrations of Raoul Duke and his attorney Dr Gonzo from the novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas : A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream , written by Hunter S. Thompson . The reference was contributed by Simpsons writer George Meyer , who stated that , since Homer and Ned were driving to Las Vegas , " we [ the Simpsons writers ] had to do a Ralph Steadman tribute . In the wedding video , Homer is seen wearing an attire similar to the ones worn by the Rat Pack members .

 In its original American broadcast on January 10 , 1999 , " Viva Ned Flanders " received an 11 @.@ 6 rating , according to Nielsen Media Research , translating to approximately 11 @.@ 5 million viewers . The same year , the episode was nominated for an Emmy award in the category of animated programming less than one hour , but it ultimately lost to the King of the Hill episode " And They Call It Bobby Love " . On August 7 , 2007 , the episode was released as part of The Simpsons : The Complete Tenth Season DVD set . 
 Following its home video release , " Viva Ned Flanders " received mostly positive reviews from critics . Ian Jane of DVD Talk wrote that the episode is a " classic " , and Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News found it to be one of the better episodes of the season . Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that even though he found Ned being 60 years old " absurd " , the episode " musters plenty of fine laughs " . He especially liked Homer 's escapades , as well as the scenes in Vegas . He concluded his review by writing that " now it ’ s Marge ’ s time to shine ! " is one of his favorite lines of the series . 
 Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , were also positive , commenting that the episode is " one of the fastest paced episodes ever " , and " moves at breathless speed " . They added that it is " enormous fun with more bizarre moments than you can shake a stick at " , particularly praising a scene involving " a hysterical Joan Rivers " . Mac MacEntire of DVD Verdict wrote that the establishing shots in Vegas were the episode 's highlights . Aaron Roxby of Collider thought negatively of the episode however , writing that , even though the episode has " some decent gags " , it is overall " one of the weaker Flanders based episodes " . 
 Similarities have been noted on multiple occasions between this episode and the 2009 film The Hangover , particularly in the inclusion of plot devices such as intoxicated , unexpected marriage and the protagonists meeting an iconic Boxer , as well as featuring a massive suite at Caesar 's Palace ( or " Nero 's Palace " in The Simpsons ) . Amber and Ginger would re @-@ appear in later episodes of the series . They first returned in the season 13 episode " Brawl in the Family " , in which they track down Homer and Ned . In the DVD commentary for said episode , current show runner Al Jean praised " Viva Ned Flanders " , but stated that he thought the ending was " loose " . He said , " Usually , like , if you leave a wife like , in Vegas , they track you down " . " Brawl in the Family " was produced to " resolve " the ending to " Viva Ned Flanders " . In the season 18 episode " Jazzy and the Pussycats " , the Simpson family attend Amber 's funeral , after it is revealed that she has died of a drug overdose while waiting in line to ride a rollercoaster . 
 = Mavis Wilton = 
 Mavis Wilton ( née Riley ) is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera Coronation Street , played by Thelma Barlow . A long @-@ running series regular , Mavis appeared in the show for 26 years from 1971 to 1997 . Introduced for a one @-@ off cameo appearance , she proved popular with producers and viewers and subsequently became a regular . 
 Mavis was portrayed as moralising , repressed , and dithering , and often appeared in comic scenes with her boss Rita Sullivan or her husband Derek Wilton . She was generally well received by critics , described as a national institution and one of Coronation Street 's best loved characters , an old @-@ fashioned spinster . Barlow has been praised for her portrayal of Mavis , a character notably spoofed by impressionist Les Dennis during the 1980s . 
 Barlow decided to leave Coronation Street in 1997 ; her character left to run a guest house in Cartmel following the death of her husband . Barlow has said that the producers of Coronation Street repeatedly asked her to return as Mavis , but she declined . 
 = = Storylines = = 
 Born in Weatherfield , Mavis was brought up in Grange @-@ over @-@ Sands where her parents , despite being teetotal , ran an off @-@ licence . Mavis first appears in Coronation Street in 1971 at Emily Nugent ( Eileen Derbyshire ) and Ernest Bishop 's ( Stephen Hancock ) engagement party , as a friend / colleague of Emily 's from the mail order warehouse and is invited to be a bridesmaid at the wedding . She is initially employed as a receptionist at the local vet and then as an assistant in the corner shop , but takes a job offered by Rita Littlewood ( Barbara Knox ) at The <unk> newsagents , 14 Rosamund Street . Mavis and Rita are complete opposites – Rita sexy and self @-@ assured , Mavis mouse @-@ like and dowdy – but they get on well and become friends . Rita often despairs at Mavis 's choices in life , particularly when it comes to men . Rita 's dominance over Mavis seems like bullying to outsiders , but she is only thinking of Mavis 's best interests . 
 In 1973 , Mavis starts dating the equally shy Jerry Booth ( Graham Haberfield ) , but it remains platonic . Jerry dies of a heart attack in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions . She meets salesman Derek Wilton ( Peter Baldwin ) the following year . They date , but the relationship is strained by Derek 's interfering mother , who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son . The relationship remains non @-@ committal until 1983 , when another man competes for Mavis 's hand , the artistic Victor Pendlebury ( Christopher Coll ) . Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end . On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar . Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek – feeling the same way she does – did not attend the ceremony either . Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne ( Diane Fletcher ) , but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again , realizing he made a mistake when he let her go . Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988 . The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke , but neither care as they are genuinely in love . They spend evenings reading aloud to each other and discussing the events of the day . They remain happy despite the occasional problem , but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident . Devastated , at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years . 
 Living in Weatherfield without Derek proves too difficult for Mavis . She surprises Rita when she suggests that they should move away and go into business together . They discuss the possibility of running a guest house in Cartmel , a village in the Lake District . Rita considers it but both realize that a partnership would not work . Mavis goes without her , buying a guest house and leaving Weatherfield in October 1997 . She and Rita bid each other an emotional farewell , ending a partnership of 25 years .

 = = = Characterisation = = = 
 Mavis Riley 's 1971 cameo appearance proved to be a hit with viewers , persuading the producers of Coronation Street to make her a regular character . It has been reported that Barlow based her portrayal of Mavis on a woman she had seen working in Granada studios ( where Coronation Street is filmed ) as well as " dozens of northern women she had seen battered into submission by worry " . Discussing the woman who inspired Mavis 's characterisation , Barlow said , " She had a strong core , but didn 't show it . She was desperate to be liked but she didn 't want to appear pushy . " 
 Discussing her character , Barlow described Mavis as a " soppy thing " , adding " she had great integrity , and she was a very loyal person . She would stick by her morality . She was a mouse to begin with , and then she met [ her future husband ] Derek and ... she learnt to be quite tough . " In Daran Little 's book The Coronation Street Story Mavis is described as a " very creative person " . She often met men through her creative endeavours , but her status as a spinster often led to feelings of bitterness , and she resented that her friend Emily had married two men before she had married once . Her lack of male attention led Mavis to be labelled the " eternal virgin " of Coronation Street . The serial 's New Zealand broadcaster TVNZ described her as " flighty and romantic " . 
 The character has been discussed in a variety of publications . Hilary Kingsley in her book Soapbox discusses Mavis 's reticent and moralistic personality as seen in her drinking habits : Mavis drinks fruit juices , but on special occasions sweet sherry : " two for Mavis is one too many " says Kingsley . In a 1983 issue of New Statesman magazine , Mavis is described as having a face that is " never quite sure of its own shape " . The author describes the storyline featuring Mavis facing the prospect of a trial marriage or losing her boyfriend as an example of the " either @-@ or situations " into which soap opera is " forever ensnaring its characters " . An article in the Evening Standard said Mavis was " meek and mild " and " would not say boo to a budgie " . In the same newspaper Mark Walton @-@ Cook discusses Mavis 's style , stating : " I keep picturing Corrie 's Mavis Riley twittering and clutching at the high neck of a securely fastened polyester blouse with a tasteful cameo brooch " . 
 Mavis was frequently used to provide comic relief ; she has been dubbed one of Coronation Street 's comedy stars , well known for her catchphrase , " ooh , I don 't really know " . Susan Purdie writes that Mavis 's storylines and persona often " hover between pathos and comedy " . The critic David Meade agrees , noting that Mavis was " a permanent mourner @-@ in @-@ waiting " . Sean @-@ Day Lewis describes Mavis as " muddled and mousy " , while Dennis Joseph Enright calls her a moralistic shop assistant who " no one takes very seriously " . She was often spoofed by comedian Les Dennis in the 1980s ; the character featured along with Dustin Gee 's impression of Vera Duckworth in a variety of sketch shows .

 The producers of the show decided to pair Mavis with Rita Fairclough ( Barbara Knox ) by giving her a job in Rita 's corner shop ; the characters ' relationship has been described as a chalk and cheese comedy partnership . Christine Geraghty has cited Mavis and Rita 's friendship as an example of a soap opera portraying an important , stable , intimate female relationship : " Rita is Mavis 's boss , but she is also one of her closest friends " . 
 A spinster for many years , Mavis resisted the advances of men , often too shy to allow dating to progress beyond the initial stages of courtship . Ian Randall comments that " Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley , but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the <unk> of the male species " . In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton ( Peter Baldwin ) , but it was more than a decade before the couple finally married in 1988 , after simultaneously <unk> each other four years earlier . Barbara Knox , who plays Rita , said , " She [ Mavis ] was quite a tough little character . You know , a lot of girls would have gone through with [ the wedding ] , and she stuck to her guns and said ' No , no this isn 't right . ' Again , dithering and weepy , but she was tough enough to do it . That scene [ where Rita supports her decision to <unk> Derek ] is reflective of the two of them . That was the essence of the friendship , they stuck up for each other and [ were ] great friends , all the way through . " 
 Richard Dyer perceives the Mavis and Derek characters to be as " shy physically " as one another , whereas Kathryn Hone , writing in The Sunday Times , considers Derek " even more dithering than Mavis " . Nevertheless the on @-@ screen relationship between the couple progresses quickly , despite the interference of Derek 's mother . Actors Thelma Barlow and Peter Baldwin had worked together before their casting as Derek and Mavis , and the two became close friends . 
 Derek and Mavis have been described by What 's on TV as " an old @-@ fashioned pair who were made for each other " , and were typically featured in comic storylines , such as one in 1995 that saw their garden gnome kidnapped and transported around the world ; Derek and Mavis received pictures of the gnome in various exotic locations , sent to them with ransom notes . It transpired that the kidnapper was Derek 's friend Norris Cole ( Malcolm Hebden ) . The Daily Record labelled this storyline one of " Coronation Street 's Classic Comic Moments " in 2008 . 
 Marilyn J. <unk> cites Mavis and Derek Wilton as examples of clever naming , in that the serial had created a fitting image of the characters before viewers even saw them together . 
 = = = Departure = = = 
 Barlow decided to leave the role of Mavis in 1997 , having played it for 26 years . It was reported that she had quit following the axing of Peter Baldwin , who played her screen husband Derek Wilton . At the time Coronation Street was undergoing off @-@ screen changes following the introduction of a new executive producer , Brian Park , dubbed " the axeman " in the press after he culled many characters from the regular cast . The actress Jean Alexander , who played the character of Hilda Ogden in the serial , went to the press in protest at the news . She wrote : " Peter Baldwin and Thelma Barlow were a wonderfully funny couple , but they 've killed off Derek and now Mavis is about to leave . Even all the humour has been taken out of scenes between Mavis and Rita . " Park suggested that when he took over as head producer there was a general feeling among the programme @-@ makers that " Derek and Mavis had had their day " . Barlow has stated her belief that the producers killed off Derek as a result of her own desire to leave . She said : " It was sort of cruel , really ; I mean , they could have killed Mavis off . It was a new director and a new producer , and they wanted to make a big news splash . It was very hard for Peter [ who played Derek ] . " The village of Cartmel , near Grange @-@ over @-@ Sands , enjoyed a boost in tourism attributed to the exposure given to it by Mavis 's storyline . 
 In 2002 producers asked Barlow to return as Mavis , but she was too busy . In 2006 Barlow claimed that she had again been asked to return to Coronation Street , but had refused as she felt the storylines were not good enough for Mavis . Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return , because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997 . Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that she would have liked Mavis to return to the serial . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Brian Meade of the Daily Mirror has suggested that Mavis was a " national institution " who enriched the life of millions . In the Scottish newspaper The Herald Alison Kerr listed Mavis as one of the female characters that in her opinion have been " the real pivot " in the serial , " ever ready with a sympathetic word " . An article in the Huddersfield Daily Examiner said that Mavis was one of Coronation Street 's best @-@ loved characters , describing her as timid and " clad in sensible cardigan and shoes " . Jules Stenson writing in The People said that Mavis was much like the previous character Minnie Caldwell ( Margot Bryant ) : they were both " easily bullied " and , like Minnie , Mavis seemed to be " on the shelf for life " until her marriage to Derek . 
 In Meade 's opinion , Mavis gave a name to and represented a certain type of woman : " A 1940s spinster with a 1940s head who 's looked 50 since birth . A Woman 's Realm made flesh . And you have a name for her . She 's a Mavis ... Mavis Riley was a masterpiece of observation " . His opinion was shared by <unk> Frey @-@ Vor and Julia Hallam , who consider Mavis to be a " model for a <unk> type of woman " . Brian Meade suggested that Barlow had " honed a comic gem until it cut into the national consciousness " in her characterisation of Mavis , likening her to other successful TV characters like Basil Fawlty , Del Boy Trotter and Alf Garnett . Meade applauded Barlow for staying true to Mavis 's character for 26 years , " sustaining the most timid , world @-@ weary of women with remarkable consistency . Try to recall her great lines and you are stumped . Every sentence she <unk> seemed to begin with ' Ooh Derek ' and end with : ' Well , I don 't really know ' " , but he suggested that she had graced some of Coronation Street 's " finest scenes " , pointing to Mavis and Rita 's spoof of a Laurel and Hardy act as one example . 
 The character received various accolades over the years . At the TV Times " Corrie Awards " , Mavis and Derek were nominated for " Best Couple " , and Susannah Clapp listed Mavis in The Observer 's " 10 best Coronation Street characters " list . Clapp said " Thelma Barlow played [ Mavis ] , with exceptional delicacy , in a variety of pastel <unk> , for 26 years . " She concluded that she had a " tumultuous relationship with her soulmate , Derek " . When Barlow quit the role as Mavis in 1997 , various Coronation Street stars praised her contribution : Sherrie Hewson ( who played Maureen Holdsworth ) said " Thelma 's a wonderful lady and a superb actress . We 'll miss her " ; Michael Le Vell ( Kevin Webster ) said " Thelma 's quality as an actress shone through for everyone to see after the death of Derek " ; Peter Baldwin ( Derek ) said " It has made a difference to the programme and the departure of Derek and now Mavis is going to upset a lot of viewers " . 
 Mavis has been praised for providing Coronation Street with much comic relief via her partnerships with Rita and Derek . Reflecting on Mavis and Derek 's partnership in 2010 , Paul Vallely of The Independent said that they were an example of a " great double act " , but he noted that they could not survive in the serial after it became focused on " dramatic storylines " . 
 Mavis has remained a popular and well @-@ loved character . In 2010 , thirteen years after her departure , Darren Fitzgerald wrote in The Sentinel ( Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent ) that he wanted to see Mavis return to the serial and that he would have written out half of the cast and brought her back as a replacement . But Mavis has also been criticised : Jack Kibble @-@ White , writing for MSN , called Mavis and Derek a " pathetic couple " , suggesting that their gnome plot was one of the serial 's most bizarre . 
 = Siege of Patras ( 805 or 807 ) = 
 The Siege of Patras in 805 or 807 was undertaken by the local Slavic tribes of the Peloponnese , reportedly with aid from an Arab fleet . The siege 's failure , attributed to the miraculous intervention of the city 's patron , Saint Andrew , marked the consolidation of Byzantine control over the Peloponnese peninsula after two centuries of Slavic rule over its western half . It also marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the Metropolis of Patras in the peninsula 's ecclesiastical affairs . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Byzantine Empire 's military position in the Balkans collapsed in the early 7th century as a result of disastrous military ventures against the Persians and then the Arabs in the East , which forced the effective abandonment of the Danube limes and opened the way for large @-@ scale penetration and settlement of the Balkan hinterland by various Slavic tribes . The Slavs raided as far as southern Greece and the coasts of Asia Minor . Most of the region 's cities were sacked or abandoned and only a few , including Thessalonica , remained occupied and in imperial hands . 
 In Greece , the eastern coasts of the Peloponnese and Central Greece remained in Byzantine hands as the theme of Hellas , while in the interior , various Slavic groups established themselves . A large native Greek population probably also remained in the land , either mixed with the Slavs or in its own autonomous communities . As elsewhere , a mostly peaceful modus vivendi soon emerged between the Slavs and the remaining Byzantine strongholds , with the mainly agricultural Slavs trading with the Byzantine @-@ held coastal towns . Further north , in the Greek mainland , by the turn of the 7th to 8th century smaller Slavic districts or <unk> emerged around the fringes of imperial territory , ruled by their own archons , who received Byzantine titles and recognized some form of imperial suzerainty . Imperial authority across Greece was greatly strengthened by the 783 campaign of the logothete Staurakios , who ventured from Constantinople overland to Thessalonica and from there south to the Peloponnese , subduing the Slavs of those regions . 
 Patras , on the northwestern coast of the Peloponnese , is claimed by the Chronicle of Monemvasia — a work of highly disputed accuracy and chronology , but an essential source for the period — to have been one of the cities abandoned c . 587 / 8 as a result of the Slavic depredations , its population fleeing to Rhegion in Calabria . This was followed by 218 years of independent Slavic rule in the Peloponnese , until around 804 / 5 . The archaeological record on the other hand shows Patras to have remained in Byzantine control throughout the period , although it is possible that part of the population indeed emigrated to Italy . 
 = = Siege of Patras = = 
 According to Chapter 49 of the De administrando imperio of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos ( r . 913 – 959 ) , in the reign of Emperor Nikephoros I ( r . 802 – 811 ) the Slavs of the Peloponnese made war on the Greek population with the aid of " African Saracens " , looted the countryside and laid siege to Patras . The city held out for a while , but as food began growing short , the inhabitants gave thought to surrendering . First , however , they dispatched a rider to the direction of Corinth , the seat of the military governor ( strategos ) , to find out whether he was coming to their aid or not . The envoy had been instructed on his return to give a signal through a flag he carried : if help was on its way , he was to dip the flag , otherwise to hold it erect . The rider found out that the strategos was not coming or was delayed — Constantine VII writes that he arrived three days after the siege had ended — but on his return to the city , his horse slipped and both he and the flag fell down . The inhabitants of Patras interpreted this as a sign that aid was near , and sallied forth against the besieging Slavs , allegedly led by the city 's patron Saint Andrew himself on horseback . The Slavs panicked at the sudden assault and fled , abandoning the siege . As a punishment , Constantine VII records that the Slavs were thereafter obligated to maintain at their own cost all officials or envoys passing through Patras , relieving the local see of this burden . 
 Constantine VII gives no precise date for the attack , but it has been usually dated to around 805 , when the city of Patras was " re @-@ founded " , according to the Chronicle of Monemvasia , or to 807 , when an Arab ( " Saracen " ) fleet is known to have reached southern Greece , although the Arab participation may well be the result of a later interpolation , mixing the real Slavic revolt with subsequent Arab raids . The Chronicle of Monemvasia on the other hand does not mention any siege of the city . Instead it records that an Armenian strategos at Corinth named Skleros defeated the Peloponnesian Slavs , and that this victory , in the year 804 / 5 or 805 / 6 , marked the end of " 218 years " of Slavic rule in the Peloponnese . Emperor Nikephoros I is then said to have rebuilt Patras by bringing back the descendants of its original inhabitants from Rhegion , and to have engaged in a large @-@ scale resettlement and Christianization program for the peninsula , bringing in Greek colonists from Italy and Asia Minor . Nikephoros ' resettlement program at least is also confirmed by the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor , who puts it slightly later , in 810 / 1 . 
 Some scholars have tried to reconcile the conflicting accounts of the Chronicle and the De administrando imperio as implying a first recovery of Patras c . 805 as the result of Skleros ' campaign , which was probably concurrent with the establishment of the Peloponnese as a separate theme from Hellas , if this had not been done slightly earlier . According to this interpretation , the Slavic revolt and attack on Patras followed as a reaction a few years later , between 807 and 811 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Whatever the exact course of events of the early 9th century , the failure of the Slavic attack on Patras consolidated the recently re @-@ established Byzantine control over the Peloponnese , and Nikephoros I 's policies led to the successful re @-@ Christianization and Hellenization of the peninsula . The defence of Patras also secured the Byzantine Empire 's main maritime road of communication with Italy and the West , as it opened up the shorter route through the Corinthian Gulf , instead of the longer , more dangerous route around the Peloponnese that was exposed to Arab attacks . 
 According to Constantine VII , the Slavs rose up again in the early 840s , but were defeated by strategos Theoktistos Bryennios . In the south , the two tribes of the <unk> and <unk> held out longer . They were eventually subdued and forced to pay heavy tribute , but retained their autonomy . These two tribes rose up again a century later , in 921 . Again they were quickly subdued , this time by the strategos <unk> <unk> , but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity until well into Frankish times . 
 The successful repulsion of the siege through the " intervention " of Saint Andrew also marked the abrupt rise of the see of Patras to prominence : formerly a suffragan of the Metropolis of Corinth , it was raised to a separate metropolis and came to enjoy great political and financial influence . Henceforth the metropolitan of Patras rivalled with his former superior in Corinth over control of the other sees of the Peloponnese . 
 = Zion National Park = 
 Zion National Park is located in the Southwestern United States , near Springdale , Utah . A prominent feature of the 229 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 590 km2 ) park is Zion Canyon , which is 15 miles ( 24 km ) long and up to half a mile ( 800 m ) deep , cut through the reddish and tan @-@ colored Navajo Sandstone by the North Fork of the Virgin River . The lowest elevation is 3 @,@ 666 ft ( 1 @,@ 117 m ) at Coalpits Wash and the highest elevation is 8 @,@ 726 ft ( 2 @,@ 660 m ) at Horse Ranch Mountain . Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau , Great Basin , and Mojave Desert regions , the park 's unique geography and variety of life zones allow for unusual plant and animal diversity . Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds , 75 mammals ( including 19 species of bat ) , and 32 reptiles inhabit the park 's four life zones : desert , riparian , woodland , and coniferous forest . Zion National Park includes mountains , canyons , buttes , mesas , monoliths , rivers , slot canyons , and natural arches . 
 Human habitation of the area started about 8 @,@ 000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans ; the semi @-@ nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi ( 300 CE ) stem from one of these groups . In turn , the Virgin Anasazi culture ( 500 CE ) developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities . A different group , the Parowan Fremont , lived in the area as well . Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the <unk> and several other Southern Paiute subtribes . Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s . In 1909 the President of the United States , William Howard Taft , named the area a National Monument to protect the canyon , under the name of Mukuntuweap National Monument . In 1918 , however , the acting director of the newly created National Park Service changed the park 's name to Zion , the name used by the Mormons . According to historian Hal Rothman : " The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time . Many believed that Spanish and Indian names would deter visitors who , if they could not pronounce the name of a place , might not bother to visit it . The new name , Zion , had greater appeal to an ethnocentric audience . " The United States Congress established the monument as a National Park on November 19 , 1919 . The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate Zion National Monument in 1937 , but was incorporated into the park in 1956 . 
 The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area includes nine formations that together represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic @-@ aged sedimentation . At various periods in that time warm , shallow seas , streams , ponds and lakes , vast deserts , and dry near @-@ shore environments covered the area . Uplift associated with the creation of the Colorado Plateaus lifted the region 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) starting 13 million years ago .

 The park is located in southwestern Utah in Washington , Iron and Kane counties . <unk> , it is located on the Markagunt and Kolob plateaus , at the intersection of three North American geographic provinces : the Colorado Plateaus , the Great Basin , and the Mojave Desert . The northern part of the park is known as the Kolob Canyons section and is accessible from Interstate 15 , exit 40 . 
 The 8 @,@ 726 @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 660 m ) summit of Horse Ranch Mountain ( photo ) is the highest point in the park ; the lowest point is the 3 @,@ 666 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 117 m ) elevation of Coal Pits Wash , creating a relief of about 5 @,@ 100 feet ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) . 
 Streams in the area take rectangular paths because they follow jointing planes in the rocks . The stream gradient of the Virgin River , whose North Fork flows through Zion Canyon in the park , ranges from 50 to 80 feet per mile ( 9 @.@ 5 to 15 @.@ 2 m / km ) ( 0 @.@ 9 – 1 @.@ 5 % ) — one of the steepest stream gradients in North America . 
 The road into Zion Canyon is 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) long , ending at the Temple of Sinawava ( " Sinawava " refers to the Coyote God of the Paiute Indians ) . At the Temple the canyon narrows and a foot @-@ trail continues to the mouth of the Zion Narrows , a gorge as narrow as 20 feet ( 6 m ) wide and up to 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) tall . The Zion Canyon road is served by a free shuttle bus from early April to late October and by private vehicles the other months of the year . Other roads in Zion are open to private vehicles year @-@ round . 
 The east side of the park is served by Zion – Mount Carmel Highway , which passes through the Zion – Mount Carmel Tunnel and ends at Mount Carmel Junction , Utah . On the east side of the park , notable park features include Checkerboard Mesa ( photo ) and the East Temple . 
 The Kolob Terrace area , west of Zion Canyon features The Subway , a slot canyon hike , and Lava Point , with a panoramic view of the entire area . The Kolob Canyons section , further west near Cedar City , features the world 's second longest arch , Kolob Arch . 
 Spring weather is unpredictable , with stormy , wet days being common , mixed with occasional warm , sunny weather . Precipitation is normally heaviest in March . Spring wildflowers bloom from April through June , peaking in May . Fall days are usually clear and mild ; nights are often cool . Summer days are hot ( 95 to 110 ° F ; 35 to 43 ° C ) , but overnight lows are usually comfortable ( 65 to 70 ° F ; 18 to 21 ° C ) . Afternoon thunderstorms are common from mid @-@ July through mid @-@ September . Storms may produce waterfalls as well as flash floods . Autumn tree @-@ color displays begin in September in the high country ; in Zion Canyon , autumn colors usually peak in late October . Winter in Zion Canyon is fairly mild . Winter storms bring rain or light snow to Zion Canyon and heavier snow to the higher elevations . Clear days may become quite warm , reaching 60 ° F ( 16 ° C ) ; nights are often 20 to 40 ° F ( − 7 to 4 ° C ) . Winter storms can last several days and make roads icy . Zion roads are plowed , except the Kolob Terrace Road which is closed when covered with snow . Winter driving conditions last from November through March . 
 Notable geographical features of the park include : Virgin River Narrows , Emerald Pools , Hidden Canyon ( photo ) , Angels Landing ( photo ) , The Great White Throne , Checkerboard Mesa ( photo ) , The Three Patriarchs ( photo ) and Kolob Arch . 
 = = History = = 
 Archaeologists have divided the long span of Zion 's human history into three cultural periods : the Archaic , Protohistoric and Historic periods . Each period is characterized by distinctive technological and social adaptations . 
 = = = Archaic period = = = 
 The first human presence in the region dates to 8 @,@ 000 years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds . About 2 @,@ 000 years ago , some groups began growing corn and other crops , leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle . Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos . Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until about 500 CE . Baskets , cordage nets , and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period . The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives , drills , and stemmed dart points . The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls . 
 By 300 CE some of the archaic groups developed into an early branch of seminomadic Anasazi , the Basketmakers . Basketmaker sites have <unk> or stone @-@ lined storage cists and shallow , partially underground dwellings called pithouses . They were hunters and gatherers who supplemented their diet with limited agriculture . Locally collected pine nuts were important for food and trade . 
 = = = Protohistoric period = = = 
 Both the Virgin Anasazi and the Parowan Fremont disappear from the archaeological record of southwestern Utah by about 1300 . Extended droughts in the 11th and 12th centuries , interspersed with catastrophic flooding , may have made horticulture impossible in this arid region . 
 Tradition and archaeological evidence hold that their replacements were <unk> @-@ speaking cousins of the Virgin Anasazi , such as the Southern Paiute and Ute . The newcomers migrated on a seasonal basis up and down valleys in search of wild seeds and game animals . Some , particularly the Southern Paiute , also planted fields of corn , sunflowers , and squash to supplement their diet . These more sedentary groups made <unk> vessels that were used for storage and cooking . 
 = = = Exploration and settlement by Euro @-@ Americans = = = 
 The Historic period begins in the late 18th century with the exploration of southern Utah by Padres Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez . The padres passed near what is now the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center on October 13 , 1776 , becoming the first people of European descent known to visit the area . In 1825 , trapper and trader Jedediah Smith explored some of the downstream areas while under contract with the American Fur Company . 
 In 1847 , Mormon farmers from the Salt Lake area became the first people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region . In 1851 , the Parowan and Cedar City , Utah areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber , and for grazing cattle , sheep , and horses . They prospected for mineral deposits , and diverted Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below . Mormon settlers named the area Kolob — in Mormon scripture , the heavenly place nearest the residence of God . 
 Settlements had expanded 30 miles ( 48 km ) south to the lower Virgin River by 1858 . That year , a Southern Paiute guide led young Mormon missionary and interpreter Nephi Johnson into the upper Virgin River area and Zion Canyon . Johnson wrote a favorable report about the agricultural potential of the upper Virgin River basin , and returned later that year to found the town of Virgin . In 1861 or 1862 , Joseph Black made the arduous journey to Zion Canyon and was very impressed by its beauty . 
 The floor of Zion Canyon was settled in 1863 by Isaac Behunin , who farmed corn , tobacco , and fruit trees . The Behunin family lived in Zion Canyon near the site of today 's Zion Lodge during the summer , and wintered in Springdale . Behunin is credited with naming Zion , a reference to a place of peace mentioned in the Bible . Two more families settled Zion Canyon in the next couple of years , bringing with them cattle and other domesticated animals . The canyon floor was farmed until Zion became a Monument in 1909 . 
 The Powell Geographic Expedition entered the area in 1869 after their first trip through the Grand Canyon . John Wesley Powell visited Zion Canyon in 1872 and named it Mukuntuweap , under the impression that that was the Paiute name . Powell Survey photographers John K. Hillers and James <unk> first visited the Zion Canyon and Kolob Plateau region in the spring of 1872 . Hillers returned in April 1873 to add more photographs to the " Virgin River Series " of photographs and stereographs . Hillers described wading the canyon for four days and nearly freezing to death to take his photographs .

 Paintings of the canyon by Frederick S. <unk> were exhibited at the Saint Louis World 's Fair in 1904 , followed by a glowing article in Scribner 's Magazine the next year . That , along with previously created photographs , paintings , and reports , led to President William Howard Taft 's proclamation on July 31 , 1909 that created Mukuntuweap National Monument . In 1917 , the acting director of the newly created National Park Service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular Mukuntuweap to Zion , a name used by the local Mormon community . The United States Congress added more land and established Zion National Park on November 19 , 1919 . A separate Zion National Monument , the Kolob Canyons area , was proclaimed on January 22 , 1937 , and was incorporated into the park on July 11 , 1956 . 
 Travel to the area before it was a national park was rare due to its remote location , lack of accommodations , and the absence of real roads in southern Utah . Old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about 1910 , and the road into Zion Canyon was built in 1917 leading to the Grotto , short of the present road that now ends at the Temple of Sinawava . 
 Touring cars could reach Zion Canyon by the summer of 1917 . The first visitor lodging in Zion Canyon , called Wylie Camp , was established that same year as a tent camp . The Utah Parks Company , a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad , acquired Wylie Camp in 1923 , and offered ten @-@ day rail / bus tours to Zion , nearby Bryce Canyon , Kaibab , and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon . The Zion Lodge complex was built in 1925 at the site of the Wylie tent camp . Architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed the Zion Lodge ( photo ) in the " Rustic Style " and the Utah Parks Company funded the construction .

 Work on the Zion – Mount Carmel Highway started in 1927 to enable reliable access between Springdale and the east side of the park . The road opened in 1930 and park visit and travel in the area greatly increased . The most famous feature of the Zion - Mount Carmel Highway is the 1 @.@ 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 8 km ) Zion - Mt . Carmel Tunnel , which has six large windows cut through the massive sandstone cliff . 
 In 1896 , local rancher John Winder improved the Native American footpath up Echo Canyon , which later became the East Rim Trail . Entrepreneur David Flanigan used this trail in 1900 to build <unk> that lowered lumber into Zion Canyon from Cable Mountain . More than 200 @,@ 000 board feet ( 470 m3 ) of lumber were lowered by 1906 . The auto road was extended to the Temple of Sinawava , and a trail built from there 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the start of the Narrows . Angel 's Landing Trail was constructed in 1926 and two suspension bridges were built over the Virgin River . Other trails were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s .

 Zion Canyon Scenic Drive provides access to Zion Canyon . Traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as a major problem in the 1990s and a public transportation system using propane @-@ powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year 2000 . As part of its shuttle fleet , Zion has two electric trams each holding up to 36 passengers . Usually from early April through late October , the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses . 
 On April 12 , 1995 , heavy rains triggered a landslide that blocked the Virgin River in Zion Canyon . Over a period of two hours , the river carved away part of the only exit road from the canyon , trapping 450 guests and employees at the Zion Lodge . A one @-@ lane , temporary road was constructed within 24 hours to allow evacuation of the Lodge . A more stable — albeit temporary — road was completed on May 25 , 1995 to allow summer visitors to access the canyon . This road was replaced with a permanent road during the first half of 1996 . 
 The Zion – Mount Carmel Highway can be travelled year @-@ round . Access for oversized vehicles requires a special permit , and is limited to daytime hours , as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles . The 5 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) -long Kolob Canyons Road was built to provide access to the Kolob Canyons section of the park . This road often closes in the winter . 
 In March 2009 , President Barack Obama signed into law the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 , which designated and further protected 124 @,@ 406 acres ( 50 @,@ 345 ha ) of park land as the Zion Wilderness . 
 In September 2015 , flooding trapped a party of seven in Keyhole Canyon , a slot canyon in the park . The flash flood killed all seven members of the group , whose remains were located after a search lasting several days .

 Streams , ponds , and lakes of the Chinle , Moenave , and Kayenta formations ; 
 The vast desert of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations ; and 
 The dry near @-@ shore environment of the Carmel Formation . 
 Uplift affected the entire region , known as the Colorado Plateaus , by slowly raising these formations more than 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) higher than where they were deposited . This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral Virgin and other rivers on the plateau . 
 The faster @-@ moving streams took advantage of uplift @-@ created joints in the rocks . Eventually , all Cenozoic @-@ aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus . Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way . During the later part of this process , lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area . 
 High water volume in wet seasons does most of the downcutting in the main canyon . These flood events are responsible for transporting most of the 3 million short tons ( 2 @.@ 7 million metric tons ) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly . The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds , so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin . The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon .

 = = Biology = = 
 The Great Basin , Mojave Desert , and Colorado Plateau converge at Zion and the Kolob canyons . This , along with the varied topography of canyon – mesa country , differing soil types , and uneven water availability , provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix of plants and animals that live in the area . The park is home to 289 bird , 79 mammals , 28 reptiles , 7 fish , and 6 amphibian species . These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the Park : desert , riparian , woodland , and coniferous forest . 
 Desert conditions persist on canyon bottoms and rocky ledges away from perennial streams . Sagebrush , prickly pear cactus , and rabbitbrush , along with sacred <unk> and Indian paintbrush , are common . Utah penstemon and golden aster can also be found . <unk> and prince 's plume are found in pockets of selenium @-@ rich soils . 
 Common daytime animals include mule deer , rock squirrels , pinyon jays , and whiptail and collared lizards ( photo ) . Desert cottontails , jackrabbits , and Merriam 's kangaroo rats come out at night . Cougars , bobcats , coyotes , badgers , gray foxes , and ring @-@ tail cats are the top predators . 
 Cooler conditions persist at mid @-@ elevation slopes , from 3 @,@ 900 to 5 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 to 1 @,@ 700 m ) . <unk> forests of pinyon pine and juniper coexist here with manzanita shrubs , <unk> , serviceberry , scrub oak , and yucca . Stands of ponderosa pine , <unk> oak , manzanita and aspen populate the mesas and cliffs above 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) . 
 Golden eagles , red @-@ tailed hawks , peregrine falcons , and white @-@ throated swifts can be seen in the <unk> bighorn sheep were reintroduced in the park in 1973 . California condors were reintroduced in the Arizona Strip and in 2014 the first successful breeding of condors in the park was confirmed . Nineteen species of bat also live in the area . 
 <unk> , Fremont cottonwood , maple , and willow dominate riparian plant communities . Animals such as bank beavers , flannel @-@ mouth suckers , gnatcatchers , dippers , canyon wrens , the virgin <unk> , and water striders all make their homes in the riparian zones . 
 = = Activities = = 
 Guided horseback riding trips , nature walks , and evening programs are available from late March to early November . The Junior Ranger Program for ages 6 to 12 is active from Memorial Day to Labor Day at the Zion Nature Center . Rangers at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center and the smaller Kolob Canyons Visitor Center can help visitors plan their stay . A bookstore attached to the Zion Canyon Visitor Center , run by the Zion Natural History Association , offers books , maps , and souvenirs for sale , with proceeds benefiting the park . The Grotto in Zion Canyon , the Visitor Center , and the viewpoint at the end of Kolob Canyons Road have the only designated picnic sites . 
 Trails 
 Seven trails with round @-@ trip times of half an hour ( Weeping Rock ) to 4 hours ( Angels Landing ) are found in Zion Canyon . Two popular trails , Taylor Creek ( 4 hours round trip ) and Kolob Arch ( 8 hours round trip ) , are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park , near Cedar City . Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer . However , hiking beyond Big Springs requires a permit . The entire Narrows from Chamberlain 's Ranch is a 16 @-@ mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking . A shorter alternative is to enter the Narrows via Orderville Canyon . Both Orderville and the full Narrows require a back country permit . Entrance to the <unk> Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited . Other often @-@ used backcountry trails include the West Rim and <unk> Creek . The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons . 
 Zion is a center for rock climbing , with short walls like Touchstone , Moonlight Buttress , Spaceshot , and Prodigal Son being very popular . 
 Camping and lodging 
 Lodging in the park is available at Zion Lodge , located halfway through Zion Canyon . Zion Lodge is open year @-@ round and has motel units and cabins , as well as a restaurant , café , and gift shop , but rooms fill up fast . Three campgrounds are available : South and Watchman at the far southern side of the park , and a primitive site at Lava Point in the middle of the park off Kolob Terrace Road . Watchman is the only campground in the park that takes reservations . Lava Point has only primitive facilities and is usually open from June to October . Overnight camping in the backcountry requires permits . 
 Nearby attractions and amenities 
 Zion Canyon IMAX in Springdale offers many interesting documentaries about the natural history of Zion Canyon and the American Southwest . 
 Lodging , food , and entertainment are also offered on the east side of the park along the Zion – Mount Carmel Highway and in Mount Carmel Junction . 
 Adjacent to the park on the south is the town of Springdale , Utah , which offers services such as lodging , food , and entertainment . 
 Driving through the east side of Zion to U.S. Route 89 allows access to Bryce Canyon National Park in the north or to the north rim of the Grand Canyon in the south . Due to the narrowness of the Zion – Mount Carmel Tunnel , RVs and buses must obtain a special pass and can only drive through the tunnel during limited hours . 
 = HMS Endeavour = 
 HMS Endeavour , also known as HM Bark Endeavour , was a British Royal Navy research vessel that Lieutenant James Cook commanded on his first voyage of discovery , to Australia and New Zealand , from 1769 to 1771 . 
 She was launched in 1764 as the collier Earl of Pembroke , and the navy purchased her in 1768 for a scientific mission to the Pacific Ocean and to explore the seas for the surmised Terra Australis Incognita or " unknown southern land " . The navy renamed and commissioned her as His Majesty 's Bark the Endeavour . She departed Plymouth in August 1768 , rounded Cape Horn , and reached Tahiti in time to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the Sun . She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south , stopping at the Pacific islands of Huahine , Bora Bora , and Raiatea to allow Cook to claim them for Great Britain . In September 1769 , she anchored off New Zealand , the first European vessel to reach the islands since Abel Tasman 's Heemskerck 127 years earlier . 
 In April 1770 , Endeavour became the first ship to reach the east coast of Australia , when Cook went ashore at what is now known as Botany Bay . Endeavour then sailed north along the Australian coast . She narrowly avoided disaster after running aground on the Great Barrier Reef , and Cook had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her . He then beached her on the mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull . On 10 October 1770 , she limped into port in Batavia ( now named Jakarta ) in the Dutch East Indies for more substantial repairs , her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had visited . She resumed her westward journey on 26 December , rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771 , and reached the English port of Dover on 12 July , having been at sea for nearly three years . 
 Largely forgotten after her epic voyage , Endeavour spent the next three years sailing to and from the Falkland Islands . Sold into private hands in 1775 , and later renamed as Lord Sandwich , she was hired as a British troop transport during the American War of Independence and was scuttled in a blockade of Narragansett Bay , Rhode Island , in 1778 . As of 2016 her wreck had not been precisely located but was thought to be one of a cluster of five in Newport Harbor , and searching continued . Relics , including six of her cannon and an anchor , are displayed at maritime museums worldwide . A replica of Endeavour was launched in 1994 and is berthed alongside the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney Harbour . The US space shuttle Endeavour is named after the ship and she is depicted on the New Zealand fifty @-@ cent coin . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Endeavour was originally the merchant collier Earl of Pembroke , built by Thomas Fishburn for Thomas Millner , launched in June 1764 from the coal and whaling port of Whitby in North Yorkshire , and of a type known locally as the Whitby Cat . She was ship @-@ rigged and sturdily built with a broad , flat bow , a square stern , and a long box @-@ like body with a deep hold . 
 A flat @-@ bottomed design made her well @-@ suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock . Her hull , internal floors , and <unk> were built from traditional white oak , her keel and stern post from elm , and her masts from pine and fir . Plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel , floors and frames in place . 
 Some doubt exists about the height of her standing masts ( excludes top and gallant masts ) , as surviving diagrams of Endeavour depict the body of the vessel only , and not the mast plan . While her main and foremast standing spars ( excludes top and gallant masts ) are accepted to be a standard ( standards differed from shipyard to shipyard and country to country ) 69 and 65 feet ( 21 and 20 m ) , respectively from an annotation on one surviving ship plan National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM <unk> which records these lengths has the mizzen as " 16 yards 29 inches " ( 15 @.@ 4 m ) . If correct , this would produce an oddly truncated mast a full 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) shorter than the standards of the day. late 20th century research suggested the annotation may be a transcription error and should read " 19 yards 29 inches " ( 24 @.@ 5 m ) , which would more closely conform with both the naval standards ( which standard ? ) and the lengths of the other masts . 
 A more recent critical review of contemporary sources doesn 't require a supposed typo in 1771 to explain this shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst at the same time offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height . Sydney Parkinson 's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM <unk> , and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold / keelson , but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10 ft above this as was sometimes done . This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8 – 9 ft below the main mast cap and approx 5 @.@ 5 ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops ( excludes top and gallant masts ) from the level of the water line . Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18 ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson 's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland , by Samuel Atkins c . 1794 at the top of this page . <unk> this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen <unk> on the original as fitted draught NMM <unk> . Using these mizzen <unk> angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold . 
 The replica standing mizzen is built to this shorter measurement and stepped in the hold on the keelson , as is the model in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich . There is a difference between the height of the mizzen fore @-@ and @-@ aft spar in the contemporary painting of Earl of Pembroke before the naval refit of 1768 by Luny ( below ) and its position on the replica in the photographs , compared to the height of the lowest spars on the fore and mainmasts . 
 = = Purchase and refit by the Admiralty = = 
 On 16 February 1768 , the Royal Society petitioned King George III to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun . Royal approval was granted for the expedition , and the Admiralty elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent Terra Australis Incognita ( or " unknown southern land " ) . 
 The Royal Society suggested command be given to Scottish geographer Alexander Dalrymple , whose acceptance was conditional on a brevet commission as a captain in the Royal Navy . However , First Lord of the Admiralty Edward Hawke refused , going so far as to say he would rather cut off his right hand than give command of a navy vessel to someone not educated as a seaman . In refusing Dalrymple 's command , Hawke was influenced by previous insubordination aboard the sloop HMS Paramour in 1698 , when naval officers had refused to take orders from civilian commander Dr. Edmond Halley . The impasse was broken when the Admiralty proposed James Cook , a naval officer with a background in mathematics and cartography . Acceptable to both parties , Cook was promoted to Lieutenant and named as commander of the expedition . 
 On 27 May 1768 , Cook took command of Earl of Pembroke , valued in March at £ 2 @,@ 307 . 5s . 6d. but ultimately purchased for £ 2 @,@ 840 . 10s . <unk> and assigned for use in the Society 's expedition . [ b ] She was refitted at Deptford on the River Thames for the sum of £ 2 @,@ 294 , almost the price of the ship itself . The hull was sheathed and caulked to protect against shipworm , and a third internal deck installed to provide cabins , a powder magazine and storerooms . The new cabins provided around 2 square metres ( 22 sq ft ) of floorspace apiece and were allocated to Cook and the Royal Society representatives : naturalist Joseph Banks , Banks ' assistants Daniel Solander and Herman <unk> , astronomer Charles Green , and artists Sydney Parkinson and Alexander Buchan . These cabins encircled the officer 's mess . The Great Cabin at the rear of the deck was designed as a workroom for Cook and the Royal Society . On the rear lower deck , cabins facing on to the mate 's mess were assigned to Lieutenants Zachary Hickes and John Gore , ship 's surgeon William Monkhouse , the gunner Stephen Forwood , ship 's master Robert Molyneux , and the captain 's clerk Richard Orton . The adjoining open mess deck provided sleeping and living quarters for the marines and crew , and additional storage space . 
 A longboat , pinnace and yawl were provided as ship 's boats , though the longboat was rotten and had to be rebuilt and painted with white lead before it could be brought aboard . These were accompanied by two privately owned skiffs , one belonging to the boatswain John <unk> , and the other to Banks . The ship was also equipped with a set of 28 ft ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) sweeps to allow her to be rowed forward if becalmed or <unk> . The refitted vessel was commissioned as His Majesty 's Bark the Endeavour , to distinguish her from the 4 @-@ gun cutter HMS Endeavour . 
 On 21 July 1768 , Endeavour sailed to Galleon 's Reach to take on armaments to protect her against potentially hostile Pacific island natives . Ten 4 @-@ pounder cannons were brought aboard , six of which were mounted on the upper deck and the remainder stowed in the hold . Twelve swivel guns were also supplied , and fixed to posts along the quarterdeck , sides and bow . The ship departed for Plymouth on 30 July , for provisioning and to board her crew of 85 , including 12 Royal Marines . Cook also ordered that twelve tons of pig iron be brought on board as sailing ballast .

 = = = Outward voyage = = = 
 Endeavour departed Plymouth on 26 August 1768 , carrying 94 people and 18 months of provisions . [ c ] Livestock on board included pigs , poultry , two greyhounds and a milking goat . 
 The first port of call was Funchal in the Madeira Islands , which Endeavour reached on 12 September . The ship was recaulked and painted , and fresh vegetables , beef and water were brought aboard for the next leg of the voyage . While in port , an accident cost the life of master 's mate Robert Weir , who became entangled in the anchor cable and was dragged overboard when the anchor was released . To replace him , Cook shanghaied a sailor from an American sloop anchored nearby . [ d ] 
 Endeavour then continued south along the coast of Africa and across the Atlantic to South America , arriving in Rio de Janeiro on 13 November 1768 . Fresh food and water were brought aboard and the ship departed for Cape Horn , which she reached during stormy weather on 13 January 1769 . Attempts to round the Cape over the next two days were unsuccessful , and Endeavour was repeatedly driven back by wind , rain and contrary tides . Cook noted that the seas off the Cape were large enough to regularly submerge the bow of the ship as she rode down from the crests of waves . At last , on 16 January the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the Cape and anchor in the Bay of Good Success on the Pacific coast . The crew were sent to collect wood and water , while Banks and his team gathered hundreds of plant specimens from along the icy shore . On 17 January two of Banks ' servants died from cold while attempting to return to the ship during a heavy snowstorm . 
 Endeavour resumed her voyage on 21 January 1769 , heading west @-@ northwest into warmer weather . She reached Tahiti on 10 April , where she remained for the next three months . The transit of Venus across the Sun occurred on 3 June , and was observed and recorded by astronomer Charles Green from Endeavour 's deck . 
 = = = Pacific exploration = = = 
 The transit observed , Endeavour departed Tahiti on 13 July and headed northwest to allow Cook to survey and name the Society Islands . Landfall was made at Huahine , Raiatea and <unk> , providing opportunities for Cook to claim each of them as British territories . However , an attempt to land the pinnace on the Austral Island of Rurutu was thwarted by rough surf and the rocky shoreline . On 15 August , Endeavour finally turned south to explore the open ocean for Terra Australis Incognita . 
 In October 1769 , Endeavour reached the coastline of New Zealand , becoming the first European vessel to do so since Abel Tasman 's Heemskerck in 1642 . Unfamiliar with such ships , the Māori people at Cook 's first landing point in Poverty Bay thought the ship was a floating island , or a gigantic bird from their mythical homeland of Hawaiki . Endeavour spent the next six months sailing close to shore , while Cook mapped the coastline and concluded that New Zealand comprised two large islands and was not the hoped @-@ for Terra Australis . In March 1770 , the longboat from Endeavour carried Cook ashore to allow him to formally proclaim British sovereignty over New Zealand . On his return , Endeavour resumed her voyage westward , her crew sighting the east coast of Australia on 19 April . On 29 April , she became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of Australia , when Cook landed one of the ship 's boats on the southern shore of what is now known as Botany Bay , New South Wales . 
 = = = Shipwreck = = = 
 For the next four months , Cook charted the coast of Australia , heading generally northward . Just before 11 pm on 11 June 1770 , the ship struck a reef , today called Endeavour Reef , within the Great Barrier Reef system . The sails were immediately taken down , a <unk> anchor set and an unsuccessful attempt was made to drag the ship back to open water . The reef Endeavour had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground , Cook measured depths up to 70 feet ( 21 m ) less than one ship 's length away . 
 Cook then ordered that the ship be lightened to help her float off the reef . Iron and stone ballast , spoiled stores and all but four of the ship 's guns were thrown overboard , and the ship 's drinking water pumped out . The crew attached buoys to the discarded guns with the intention of retrieving them later , but this proved impractical . Every man on board took turns on the pumps , including Cook and Banks . 
 When , by Cook 's reckoning , about 40 to 50 long tons ( 41 to 51 t ) of equipment had been thrown overboard , on the next high tide a second unsuccessful attempt was made to pull the ship free . In the afternoon of 12 June , the longboat carried out two large bower anchors , and block and tackle were rigged to the anchor chains to allow another attempt on the evening high tide . The ship had started to take on water through a hole in her hull . Although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef , Cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10 : 20 pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off . The anchors were retrieved , except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned . 
 As expected the leak increased once the ship was off the reef , and all three working pumps had to be continually manned . A mistake occurred in sounding the depth of water in the hold , when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross @-@ beams . The mistake suggested the water depth had increased by about 18 inches ( 46 cm ) between soundings , sending a wave of fear through the ship . As soon as the mistake was realised , redoubled efforts kept the pumps ahead of the leak . 
 The prospects if the ship sank were grim . The vessel was 24 miles ( 39 km ) from shore and the three ship 's boats could not carry the entire crew . Despite this , Joseph Banks noted in his journal the calm efficiency of the crew in the face of danger , contrary to stories he had heard of seamen panicking or refusing orders in such circumstances . 
 Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse proposed <unk> the ship , as he had previously been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully . He was entrusted with supervising the task , sewing bits of oakum and wool into an old sail , which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull . The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering , allowing the crew to stop two of the three pumps . 
 Endeavour then resumed her course northward and parallel to the reef , the crew looking for a safe harbour in which to make repairs . On 13 June , the ship came to a broad watercourse that Cook named the Endeavour River . Cook attempted to enter the river mouth , but strong winds and rain prevented Endeavour from crossing the bar until the morning of 17 June . She grounded briefly on a sand spit but was refloated an hour later and warped into the river proper by early afternoon . The ship was promptly beached on the southern bank and careened to make repairs to the hull . Torn sails and rigging were also replaced and the hull scraped free of barnacles . 
 An examination of the hull showed that a piece of coral the size of a man 's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off . Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother , this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef . 
 = = = Northward to Batavia = = = 
 After waiting for the wind , Endeavour resumed her voyage on the afternoon of 5 August 1770 , reaching the northernmost point of Cape York Peninsula fifteen days later . On 22 August , Cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim British sovereignty over the eastern Australian mainland . Cook christened his landing place Possession Island , and ceremonial volleys of gunfire from the shore and Endeavour 's deck marked the occasion . 
 Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward along the coast , picking a path through intermittent shoals and reefs with the help of the pinnace , which was rowed ahead to test the water depth . By 26 August she was out of sight of land , and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea , earlier navigated by Luis <unk> de Torres in 1606 . To keep Endeavour 's voyages and discoveries secret , Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been . 
 After a three @-@ day layover off the island of Savu , Endeavour sailed on to Batavia , the capital of the Dutch East Indies , on 10 October . A day later lightning during a sudden tropical storm struck the ship , but the rudimentary " electric chain " or lightning rod that Cook had ordered rigged to Endeavour 's mast saved her from serious damage . 
 The ship remained in very poor condition following her grounding on the Great Barrier Reef in June . The ship 's carpenter , John <unk> , observed that she was " very leaky – makes from twelve to six inches an hour , occasioned by her main keel being wounded in many places , false keel gone from beyond the midships . Wounded on her <unk> side where the greatest leak is but I could not come at it for the water . " An inspection of the hull revealed that some unrepaired planks were cut through to within ⅛ inch ( 3 mm ) . Cook noted it was a " surprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water " for the previous three @-@ month voyage across open seas . 
 After riding at anchor for two weeks , Endeavour was heaved out of the water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs . Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with <unk> , which required careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull . Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked , scraped of shellfish and marine flora , and repainted . Finally , the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England . Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770 , and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean . 
 = = = Return voyage = = = 
 Though Endeavour was now in good condition , her crew were not . During the ship 's stay in Batavia , all but 10 of the 94 people aboard had been taken ill with malaria and dysentery . [ e ] By the time Endeavour set sail on 26 December , seven crew members had died and another forty were too sick to attend their duties . Over the following twelve weeks , a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea , including <unk> , Green , Parkinson , and the ship 's surgeon William Monkhouse . 
 Cook attributed the sickness to polluted drinking water , and ordered that it be purified with lime juice , but this had little effect . Jonathan Monkhouse , who had proposed <unk> the ship to save her from sinking on the reef , died on 6 February , followed six days later by ship 's carpenter John <unk> , whose skilled repair work in Batavia had allowed Endeavour to resume her voyage . The health of the surviving crew members then slowly improved as the month progressed , with the last deaths from disease being three ordinary seamen on 27 February . 
 On 13 March 1771 , Endeavour rounded the Cape of Good Hope and made port in Cape Town two days later . Those still sick were taken ashore for treatment . The ship remained in port for four weeks awaiting the recovery of the crew and undergoing minor repairs to her masts . On 15 April , the sick were brought back on board along with ten recruits from Cape Town , and Endeavour resumed her homeward voyage . The English mainland was sighted on 10 July and Endeavour entered the port of Dover two days later . 
 Approximately one month after his return , Cook was promoted to the rank of Commander , and by November 1771 was in receipt of Admiralty Orders for a second expedition , this time aboard HMS Resolution . He was killed during an altercation with Hawaiians at Kealakekua Bay on 14 February 1779 . 
 = = Later service = = 
 While Cook was fêted for his successful voyage , Endeavour was largely forgotten . Within a week of her return to England , she was directed to Woolwich Dockyard for refitting as a naval transport . Under the command of Lieutenant James Gordon she then made three return voyages to the Falkland Islands . 
 The first , with Joseph Irving as sailing master ( replaced by John Dykes at Portsmouth due to illness ) , was to deliver " sufficient provisions to serve 350 men to the end of the year 1772 " ; she sailed from Portsmouth on 8 November 1771 , but due to terrible weather did not arrive at Port Egmont ( the British base in the Falkland Islands ) until 1 March . Endeavour sailed from Port Egmont on 4 May in a three @-@ month non @-@ stop voyage until she anchored at Portsmouth . 
 The second voyage was to reduce the garrison and replace HM Sloop Hound , John Burr Commander , with a smaller vessel , namely the 36 @-@ ton shallop Penguin , commander Samuel Clayton . She was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart , and the pieces were stowed in Endeavour . Endeavour sailed in November with Hugh Kirkland as the sailing master , and additionally the crew of Penguin , and four ship 's carpenters whose job was to reassemble Penguin on arrival , which was 28 January 1773 . On 17 April Endeavour and Hound sailed for England with their crew . One of Penguin 's crew was Bernard Penrose who wrote an account . Samuel Clayton also wrote an account . 
 The third voyage sailed in January 1774 and her purpose was to evacuate the Falklands entirely as Britain was faced with political difficulties from the American Colonies , the French and the Spanish . The government thought that if British ships and troops were engaged in America , Spain might seize the Falklands , capturing the small garrison at Port Egmont and maybe killing some of them - this , it was feared , would trigger an outcry which might topple the government . Endeavour left England in January 1774 , and sailed from the Falklands with all the British inhabitants on 23 April , leaving a flag and a plaque . 
 Endeavour was paid off in September 1774 , and in March 1775 was sold by the Navy to shipping magnate J. Mather for £ 645 . Mather returned her to sea for at least one commercial voyage to Archangel in Russia . 
 Once the American War of Independence had commenced , the British government needed ships to carry troops and materiel across the Atlantic . In 1775 Mather submitted Endeavour as a transport ship , and she was rejected . Thinking that renaming her would fool Deptford Yard , Mather resubmitted Endeavour under the name Lord Sandwich Lord Sandwich was rejected in no uncertain terms : " Unfit for service . She was sold out Service Called Endeavour Bark refused before " . Lord Sandwich then had serious repairs , and on her third submission was accepted and was termed Lord Sandwich 2 as there was already a transport ship called Lord Sandwich . 
 Lord Sandwich 2 , master William Author , sailed on 6 May 1776 from Portsmouth in a fleet of 100 vessels , 68 of which were transports , which was under orders to support Howe 's campaign to capture New York . Lord Sandwich 2 carried 206 men mainly of the Hessian du Corps regiment of Hessian mercenaries . The crossing was terrible , and two Hessians who were in the same fleet have left us accounts of the voyage . The scattered fleet assembled at Halifax and then sailed to Sandy Hook where other ships and troops assembled . On 15 August 1776 Lord Sandwich 2 was anchored at Sandy Hook ; also assembled there was Adventure ( which had sailed with Resolution on Cook 's second voyage ) , now a storeship , captain John Hallum . Another ship there at that time was HMS Siren , captain Tobias Furneaux , who had commanded Adventure on the second voyage . 
 New York was eventually captured , but Newport , Rhode Island in the hands of the Americans posed a threat as a base for recapturing New York , so in November 1776 a fleet , which included Lord Sandwich 2 carrying Hessian Troops , set out to take Rhode Island , which was taken but not subdued , and Lord Sandwich 2 was needed as a prison ship .

 The surrender of Burgoyne 's army at Saratoga , brought France into the war , and in the summer of 1778 a pincer plan was agreed to recapture Newport : the Continental Army would approach overland , and a French Fleet would sail into the harbour . To prevent the latter the British commander , Captain John Brisbane , determined to blockade the bay by sinking surplus vessels at its mouth . Between 3 and 6 August a fleet of Royal Navy and hired craft , including Lord Sandwich 2 , were scuttled at various locations in the Bay . [ f ] Lord Sandwich 2 , previously Endeavour , previously Earl of Pembroke , was sunk on 4 August 1778 . 
 The owners of the sunken vessels were compensated by the British government for the loss of their ships . The Admiralty valuation for 10 of the sunken vessels recorded that many had been built in Yorkshire , and the details of the Lord Sandwich transport matched those of the former Endeavour including construction in Whitby , a burthen of 368 71 / 94 tons , and re @-@ entry into Navy service on 10 February 1776 . In 1834 a letter appeared in the Providence Journal of Rhode Island , drawing attention to the possible presence of the former Endeavour on the seabed of the bay . This was swiftly disputed by the British consul in Rhode Island , who wrote claiming that Endeavour had been bought from Mather by the French in 1790 and renamed Liberté . The consul later admitted he had heard this not from the Admiralty , but as hearsay from the former owners of the French ship . It was later suggested Liberté , which sank off Newport in 1793 , was in fact another of Cook 's ships , the former HMS Resolution , or another Endeavour , a naval schooner sold out of service in 1782 . A further letter to the Providence Journal stated that a retired English sailor was conducting guided tours of a hulk on the River Thames as late as 1825 , claiming that the ship had once been Cook 's Endeavour . 
 In 1991 the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project ( RIMAP ) began research into the identity of the thirteen transports sunk as part of the Newport blockade of 1778 , including Lord Sandwich . In 1999 RIMAP discovered documents in the Public Record Office ( now called the National Archives ) in London confirming that Endeavour had been renamed Lord Sandwich , had served as a troop transport to North America , and had been scuttled at Newport as part of the 1778 fleet of transports . 
 In 1999 a combined research team from RIMAP and the Australian National Maritime Museum examined some known wrecks in the harbour and in 2000 , RIMAP and the ANMM examined a site that appears to be one of the blockade vessels , partly covered by a separate wreck of a 20th @-@ century barge . The older remains were those of a wooden vessel of approximately the same size , and possibly a similar design and materials as Lord Sandwich ex Endeavour . Confirmation that Cook 's former ship had indeed been in Newport Harbor sparked considerable media and public interest in confirming her location . However , further mapping showed eight other 18th @-@ century wrecks in Newport Harbor , some with features and conditions also consistent with Endeavour . In 2006 RIMAP announced that the wrecks were unlikely to be raised . In 2016 RIMAP concluded that there was a probability of 80 to 100 % that the wreck of Endeavour was still in Newport Harbor , probably one of a cluster of five wrecks on the seafloor , and planned to investigate the ships and their artifacts further . They were seeking funds to build facilities for handling and storing recovered objects . 
 = = Endeavour relics and legacy = = 
 In addition to the search for the remains of the ship herself , there was considerable Australian interest in locating relics of the ship 's south Pacific voyage . In 1886 , the Working Men 's Progress Association of Cooktown sought to recover the six cannons thrown overboard when Endeavour grounded on the Great Barrier Reef . A £ 300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns , but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed . Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900 , and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an Endeavour cannon from shallow water near the Reef . 
 In 1937 , a small part of Endeavour 's keel was gifted to the Australian Government by philanthropist Charles Wakefield in his capacity as president of the Admiral Arthur Phillip Memorial . Prime Minister Joseph Lyons of Australia described the section of keel as " intimately associated with the discovery and foundation of Australia " . 
 Searches were resumed for the lost Endeavour Reef cannons , but expeditions in 1966 , 1967 , and 1968 were unsuccessful . They were finally recovered in 1969 by a research team from the American Academy of Natural Sciences , using a sophisticated magnetometer to locate the cannons , a quantity of iron ballast and the abandoned bower anchor . Conservation work on the cannons was undertaken by the Australian National Maritime Museum , after which two of the cannons were displayed at its headquarters in Sydney 's Darling Harbour , and eventually put on display at Botany Bay and the National Museum of Australia in Canberra ( with a replica remaining at the museum ) . A third cannon and the bower anchor were displayed at the James Cook Museum in Cooktown , with the remaining three at the National Maritime Museum in London , the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia , and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington . 
 Endeavour 's Pacific voyage was further commemorated in the use of her image on the reverse of the New Zealand fifty @-@ cent coin , and in the naming of the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1989 . 
 = = Replica vessels = = 
 In January 1988 , to commemorate the Australian Bicentenary of European settlement in Australia , work began in Fremantle , Western Australia , on a replica of Endeavour . Financial difficulties delayed completion until December 1993 , and the vessel was not commissioned until April 1994 . The replica vessel commenced her maiden voyage in October of that year , sailing to Sydney Harbour and then following Cook 's path from Botany Bay northward to Cooktown . From 1996 to 2002 , the replica retraced Cook 's ports of call around the world , arriving in the original Endeavour 's home port of Whitby in May 1997 and June 2002 . Footage of waves shot while rounding Cape Horn on this voyage was later used in digitally composited scenes in the 2003 film Master and Commander : The Far Side of the World . 
 The replica Endeavour visited various European ports before undertaking her final ocean voyage from Whitehaven to Sydney Harbour on 8 November 2004 . Her arrival in Sydney was delayed when she ran aground in Botany Bay , a short distance from the point where Cook first set foot in Australia 235 years earlier . The replica Endeavour finally entered Sydney Harbour on 17 April 2005 , having travelled 170 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 310 @,@ 000 km ) , including twice around the world . Ownership of the replica was transferred to the Australian National Maritime Museum in 2005 for permanent service as a museum ship in Sydney 's Darling Harbour . 
 A second full @-@ size replica of Endeavour is berthed on the River Tees in Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees . While this reflects the external dimensions of Cook 's vessel , this replica was constructed with a steel rather than a timber frame , has one less internal deck than the original , and is not designed to be put to sea . 
 The Russell Museum , in the Bay of Islands , New Zealand , has a seagoing one @-@ fifth scale replica of the Endeavour . It was built in Auckland ; during 1969 and 1970 it sailed some 15 @,@ 000 miles ( 24 @,@ 000 km ) in New Zealand and Australia . 
 At Whitby the " Bark Endeavour Whitby " is a scaled @-@ down replica of the original ship . It relies on engines for propulsion and is a little less than half the size of the original . Trips for tourists take them along the coast to Sandsend .

 Louis Jean Joseph Leblanc ( born January 26 , 1991 ) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey centre . 
 Leblanc played minor hockey in the Montreal region before he moved to the United States in 2008 , where he played one season with the Omaha Lancers of the United States Hockey League ( USHL ) and was named Rookie of the Year . Eligible for the 2009 NHL Entry Draft , he was selected 18th overall by the Montreal Canadiens . He then enrolled at Harvard University and spent one season with the Crimson , being named Ivy League rookie of the year , before he signed a contract with the Canadiens in 2010 . Leblanc joined the Montreal Juniors later that year , who had earlier acquired his Quebec Major Junior Hockey League ( QMJHL ) playing rights . Midway through his first season in the QMJHL , Leblanc played in the 2011 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships for Team Canada ; it was the second time he had played in an international tournament , having played at the 2008 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament , where Canada won the gold medal .

 Leblanc was selected 18th overall by the Val @-@ d 'Or Foreurs in the 2007 QMJHL Draft , but instead went to the Omaha Lancers of the United States Hockey League ( USHL ) , with the intent of attending university in the United States . He spent the 2008 – 09 season with Omaha and played in 60 games for the Lancers , finishing with 28 goals and 31 assists for 59 points . His point total led the team in scoring and tied for tenth overall in the USHL ; his goal total was tied for eighth overall , and the six game @-@ winning goals Leblanc scored were tied for second overall . In recognition of his season , the USHL named him the league 's rookie of the year . 
 Leblanc was one of the top @-@ ranked prospects for the 2009 NHL Entry Draft , ranked 13th overall among North American skaters by NHL Central Scouting , and was selected 18th overall by the Montreal Canadiens , who were hosts of the Draft . Leblanc was the first francophone selected in the first round of the Entry Draft by the Canadiens since they picked Eric Chouinard 16th overall in 1998 . Leblanc was praised for his speed and determination , in addition to his willingness to go to the corners for the puck , as well as being a natural goal @-@ scorer . Then @-@ Canadiens General Manager Bob Gainey also applauded Leblanc 's choice to move to the United States and play in the USHL rather than stay in Quebec with the QMJHL and stated that as it was a more difficult developmental route , it showed he had good character . 
 Leblanc enrolled at Harvard University in September 2009 , and began playing for the university 's hockey team , the Crimson . In his one year at Harvard , Leblanc led the team in goals ( 11 ) , assists ( 12 ) and points ( 23 ) . He was named the Ivy League rookie of the year , and was a finalist for the ECAC rookie of the year . 
 On July 30 , 2010 , Leblanc signed a three @-@ year contract with the Canadiens . By agreeing to an NHL contract , he forfeited his NCAA eligibility , being considered a professional . Leblanc subsequently left Harvard and joined the Montreal Junior Hockey Club of the QMJHL for the 2010 – 11 season . His QMJHL rights had previously been owned by three different teams . Originally selected by Val @-@ d 'Or in the 2007 QMJHL Draft , the team traded him to the Chicoutimi <unk> on January 8 , 2009 . His rights were traded again on June 5 , 2010 , when Chicoutimi sent him to the Juniors . After attending his first training camp with the Canadiens in September 2010 , Leblanc was sent back to the Juniors , where he made his QMJHL debut on September 10 in Montreal against the Shawinigan Cataractes ; he recorded his first point , an assist , in the game . Two days later , he scored his first goal in the QMJHL , in addition to three assists , against the Gatineau Olympiques . 
 The Montreal Juniors relocated in the summer of 2011 and became the Blainville @-@ <unk> Armada . On August 22 , 2011 , the summer trade deadline in the QMJHL , Leblanc was traded by the Armada to the Shawinigan Cataractes in exchange for Cole Hawes . Because Leblanc was now eligible to play in the American Hockey League ( AHL ) due to being 20 years old , Blainville @-@ <unk> received two draft choices from Shawinigan , who hosted ( and won ) the 2012 Memorial Cup , if Leblanc played . 
 = = = Professional = = = 
 Leblanc made his professional debut on October 27 , 2011 , scoring three points for the Hamilton Bulldogs of the AHL , including potting the overtime winner , to give his team a 3 – 2 victory over the Rochester Americans . 
 On November 28 , 2011 , Montreal recalled Leblanc from their Hamilton AHL affiliate to join the Canadiens ; Leblanc had recorded four goals and six assists in 14 games with the Bulldogs by that point . He made his NHL debut November 30 against the Anaheim Ducks . He recorded his first NHL point , an assist on a goal by Andrei <unk> on December 3 , against the Los Angeles Kings . In addition , he scored his first NHL goal in a 4 – 3 loss against the Philadelphia Flyers on December 15 , 2011 . Leblanc split the remainder of the season playing with both Montreal and Hamilton . He played 42 games for the Canadiens , where he had five goals and five assists , and 31 games with the Bulldogs , scoring 11 goals and 11 assists . 
 With Leblanc failing to establish himself on the Canadiens roster , on June 14 , 2014 , he was traded to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a conditional fifth @-@ round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft . 
 On July 17 , 2015 , Leblanc signed as a free agent to a one @-@ year , two @-@ way contract with the New York Islanders . After failing to secure a spot in New York 's lineup and being assigned to New York 's AHL affiliate , Bridgeport Sound Tigers , the team agreed to release him from his contract and he quickly signed with HC Slovan Bratislava of the Kontinental Hockey League ( KHL ) . 
 On January 15 , 2016 , it was announced that Leblanc signed with Lausanne HC of the National League A ( NLA ) . 
 On June 29 , 2016 , Leblanc announced his retirement from professional ice hockey .

 Leblanc first participated in an international tournament when he played for the Canadian national junior team at the 2008 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in August 2008 @.@ he led the team with three goals and added two assists for five points as Canada won the gold medal . Leblanc was then invited to try out for the national junior team prior to the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships , but was one of the last players cut from the team . There was speculation that since he played in the NCAA rather than the Canadian Hockey League ( CHL ) , it hindered his chances of making the team , as CHL players had played considerably more games than those in the NCAA . Leblanc also had exams scheduled around the time of the camp . He was invited to the summer camp the following year in St. John 's , Newfoundland and Labrador , and was one of the better players at the camp . After the pre @-@ tournament camp in December 2010 , Leblanc was named to the final roster for the 2011 World Juniors . 
 In Canada 's first game against Russia , Leblanc earned his first point , an assist . He scored his first goal , short @-@ handed ( Canada 's first in the tournament ) , and added an assist in the second game , versus the Czech Republic . He later notched an assist in the gold medal game , where Canada lost to Russia 5 – 3 . He finished the tournament with three goals and seven points over seven games and ranked fourth in team scoring .

 = Outlaw Run = 
 Outlaw Run is a wooden roller coaster located at the Silver Dollar City amusement park in Branson , Missouri . The ride was the first wooden roller coaster manufactured by Rocky Mountain Construction and the first wooden roller coaster with multiple inversions , in which riders are turned upside @-@ down and then back upright . The 2 @,@ 937 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 895 m ) ride features three inversions and a top speed of 68 miles per hour ( 109 km / h ) , making Outlaw Run the fourth @-@ fastest wooden roller coaster in the world . The 162 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 49 m ) first drop of the ride is the second steepest in the world among wooden roller coasters , at 81 ° beyond horizontal . 
 Planning for Outlaw Run began in 2009 , three years before its official announcement in August 2012 . Rocky Mountain Construction were contracted to manufacture the ride as their proposal best suited Silver Dollar City 's available space and budget . The ride 's track layout was designed by Alan Schilke . Outlaw Run opened to the public on March 15 , 2013 , to generally positive reviews . 
 = = Planning and marketing = = 
 Planning for a new 2013 attraction in the Silver Dollar City amusement park began in 2009 with the owners , <unk> Family Entertainment , approaching Rocky Mountain Construction and other manufacturers for ideas for " a ride with marketing appeal " . Joel Manby , CEO of <unk> , wanted a " world first " , to have a wooden roller coaster that would be " the first to do a double barrel roll " , which is when the train goes twice through a combination of a loop and a roll . In 2011 , Rocky Mountain Construction showcased their new steel roller coaster , New Texas Giant , to park executives . This demonstration secured the contract . 
 Marketing began in 2011 when the public were made aware at the 2011 trade show of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions that Rocky Mountain were working on a wooden roller coaster ; it being later revealed that this roller coaster would be built at Silver Dollar City . Following the beginning of construction at the park , Silver Dollar City launched a teaser website for a new attraction to open in 2013 . The website featured a public notice indicating that the ride 's theme would be stagecoaches and the wild west . The teaser website also stated that an announcement would be made on August 9 , 2012 . As part of its teaser campaign leading to the announcement , the park released two clues ; the first clue was a handwritten letter , while the second was a photo of the park 's Powder Keg : A Blast into the Wilderness attraction and the nearby Table Rock Lake . On August 9 , 2012 , Silver Dollar City officially announced that Outlaw Run would open in the second quarter of 2013 . At its opening , the ride would be the only wooden roller coaster to feature inversions and would feature the steepest drop on a wooden roller coaster . At a cost of $ 10 million , the ride would be the most expensive Silver Dollar City attraction in more than a decade . 
 On September 26 , 2012 , the last piece of track was installed on Outlaw Run . The ride opened to a limited audience on March 13 , 2013 , with a public opening two days later . Official opening celebrations were held in April . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Outlaw Run was Rocky Mountain Construction 's first wooden roller coaster . It is the sixth fastest wooden roller coaster in the world , reaching speeds of up to 68 miles per hour ( 109 km / h ) . Throughout the course of the 2 @,@ 937 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 895 m ) ride , riders go through three inversions , including a double heartline roll . The park 's existing terrain ( the park is located in the Ozark Mountains ) is used to allow a 107 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 33 m ) lift hill to be translated into a first drop stretching 162 feet ( 49 m ) . 
 The 2 @,@ 937 feet ( 895 m ) of track is made primarily of layers of laminated wood , with a steel plate located in the upper layers of the track . The steel plating is known as Topper Track and is found on many roller coasters that Rocky Mountain Construction has renovated . This track style is designed to reduce the maintenance typically required for a wooden roller coaster and to provide a smoother ride experience . Rocky Mountain Construction spent four years developing technology to allow them to twist beams of wood , that make up the lower layers of the track . This track configuration allows for more dynamic roller coaster elements to be performed on a wooden roller coaster . 
 Outlaw Run consists of two trains , each featuring twelve pairs of riders . Riders , who must be 48 inches ( 122 cm ) or taller to ride , are restrained in their individual fiberglass seats with a U @-@ shaped lap bar . Unlike most roller coaster trains , which have polyurethane wheels , Outlaw Run features steel wheels . 
 Outlaw Run features a Western stagecoach theme . The ride 's station is themed as a stagecoach depot located in the outskirts of Silver Dollar City . According to the ride 's storyline , stagecoaches depart daily heading west , where they are intercepted by outlaws who want to steal the riders ' belongings . Outlaw Run riders are law enforcement personnel tasked with stopping the outlaws . To keep their family @-@ friendly image , Silver Dollar City uses a variety of theming to advertise that the " good guys " will always win . 
 = = Ride experience = = 
 The train exits out of the station and ascends the chain lift hill . The track then goes through a small pre @-@ drop , similar to that on Bolliger & Mabillard steel roller coasters , before dropping 162 feet ( 49 m ) at an angle of 81 ° . The train then ascends into the first element , an outside banked turn , where the track is banked over to 153 ° before rolling back out of the bank . After going around a low @-@ to @-@ the @-@ ground curve , the train enters a 100 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 30 m ) double down followed by a 70 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 21 m ) double up . After more turns , the train enters a small air @-@ time hill . Outlaw Run 's final two inversions are heartline rolls , turns in which the axis of rotation is approximately at the riders ' hearts . The train then enters the brake run and returns to the station . A single ride cycle is completed in approximately 1 minute and 27 seconds . 
 = = Records = = 
 Outlaw Run debuted with the steepest drop , 81 ° , on any wooden roller coaster in the world at the time . Although the creators of Outlaw Run originally planned to claim the record for the only operating wooden roller coaster to feature inversions , the announcement of Hades 360 at Mt . Olympus Water & Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells , Wisconsin , forced Silver Dollar City to modify their claim ; they now cite Outlaw Run as the only wooden roller coaster to feature multiple inversions . It is also tied with <unk> at Heide Park as the second fastest wooden roller coaster in the world , with a top speed of 68 miles per hour ( 109 km / h ) . The speed , height , and drop angle records were broken by Goliath at Six Flags Great America in the first half of 2014 . Goliath is another Rocky Mountain Construction roller coaster . Outlaw Run retains the record for the wooden roller coaster with the most inversions .

 Following the announcement of Outlaw Run , the ride 's layout received favorable reviews . Arthur Levine of About.com said that " the coaster appears to have a great layout and should provide the kind of ride that fans adore " . Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times ranked Outlaw Run in his top 13 most anticipated new theme park attractions in the United States for 2013 . 
 Outlaw Run received largely positive reviews following the ride 's opening in 2013 . Marcus <unk> of WGN @-@ TV was among the first to ride Outlaw Run . Despite his high expectations , he described it as " a great ride ; an incredible ride " . Brandy McDonnell of The Oklahoman described Outlaw Run as the highlight of Silver Dollar City : " it 's a speedy and spine @-@ tingling ride worth waiting a few hours to take " . Tim Baldwin of Roller Coaster Magazine described Outlaw Run as " exhilarating but not intimidating " and " satisfying to the thrill seekers and fun for moms as well " . Justin <unk> of First Drop Magazine , after describing pacing as an important characteristic of a roller coaster , said " So many coasters get it wrong . Outlaw Run gets it right . " 
 In its debut year , Outlaw Run ranked highly in Amusement Today 's Golden Ticket Awards . The ride won the Golden Ticket Award for Best New Ride with 45 % of the vote . It also ranked at position 7 for the world 's best wooden roller coasters . 
 = Oryzomys antillarum = 
 Oryzomys antillarum , also known as the Jamaican rice rat , is an extinct rodent of Jamaica . A member of the genus Oryzomys within the family Cricetidae , it is similar to O. couesi of mainland Central America , from where it may have dispersed to its island during the last glacial period . O. antillarum is common in subfossil cave faunas and is also known from three specimens collected live in the 19th century . Some historical records of Jamaican rats may pertain to it . The species probably became extinct late in the 19th century , perhaps due to the introduction of the small Asian mongoose , competition with introduced rodents such as the brown rat , and habitat destruction . 
 Oryzomys antillarum was a medium @-@ sized rat , similar in most respects to Oryzomys couesi . The head and body length was 120 to 132 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 to 5 @.@ 2 in ) and the skull was about 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) long . The upperparts were reddish and graded into the yellowish underparts . The tail was about as long as the head and body , sparsely haired , and darker above than below . The species differed from O. couesi in having longer nasal bones , shorter incisive foramina ( perforations of the front part of the palate ) , and more robust zygomatic arches ( cheekbones ) . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 In his 1877 monograph on North American rodents , Elliott Coues mentioned two specimens of Oryzomys from Jamaica in the collections of the United States National Museum ( USNM ) . According to Coues , the specimens were similar to the marsh rice rat ( Oryzomys palustris ) of the United States , but different in color . Although he wrote that they probably represented a separate form , he refrained from giving a scientific name to them because of the possibility that the form had already received a name he did not know of . The species was first formally described by Oldfield Thomas in 1898 based on a specimen that had been in the British Museum of Natural History since 1845 . He recognized it as a separate species of Oryzomys , Oryzomys antillarum , but wrote that it was related to the mainland Central American O. couesi . Thomas suspected that the species was already extinct on Jamaica , but that it or a similar rice rat could still be found in the unexplored interior of Cuba or Hispaniola . 
 Revising North American Oryzomys in 1918 , Edward Alphonso Goldman retained O. antillarum as a separate species , but conceded that it was so similar to mainland O. couesi that it may have been introduced on Jamaica . In 1920 , Harold Anthony reported that remains of O. antillarum were common in coastal caves , suggesting that the species had previously been an important part of the diet of the barn owl ( Tyto alba ) . In 1942 , Glover Morrill Allen doubted that it was even a distinct species and in his 1962 Ph.D. thesis , Clayton Ray , who examined numerous cave specimens , agreed and retained it as only a " weakly differentiated subspecies " of Oryzomys palustris ( which by then included O. couesi and other Mexican and Central American forms ) , Oryzomys palustris antillarum . Philip Hershkovitz came to the same conclusion in a 1966 paper . After O. couesi of Mexico and Central America was again classified as a species distinct from the marsh rice rat ( O. palustris ) of the United States , the Jamaican form came to be regarded as a subspecies of the former , Oryzomys couesi antillarum . 
 In a 1993 review , Gary Morgan reinstated the animal as a distinct species closely related to O. couesi , citing an unpublished paper by Humphrey , Setzer , and himself . Guy Musser and Michael Carleton , writing for the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the World , continued to classify the Jamaican form as part of O. couesi , but did not reference Morgan . However , in a 2006 review of the contents of Oryzomys , Marcelo Weksler and colleagues listed O. antillarum as a separate species , citing Morgan , and in a 2009 paper on western Mexican Oryzomys Carleton and Joaquín Arroyo @-@ Cabrales did the same . 
 According to the classification by Carleton and Arroyo @-@ Cabrales , Oryzomys antillarum is one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys , which occurs from the eastern United States ( O. palustris ) into northwestern South America ( O. gorgasi ) . O. antillarum is further part of the O. couesi section , which is centered on the widespread Central American O. couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions . Many aspects of the systematics of the O. couesi section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group . Oryzomys previously included many other species , which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in the 2006 paper by Weksler and colleagues , which excluded more than forty species from the genus . All are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ( " rice rats " ) , a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species , and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae , along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents . 
 = = Description = = 
 Oryzomys antillarum was a medium @-@ sized rodent , about as large as O. couesi . According to Thomas 's description , the upperparts were reddish , slightly brighter on the rump and more grayish on the head . The color of the upperparts graded into that of the underparts , which were yellowish . The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases . The small ears were black on the outer and yellow on the inner side and the upper surfaces of the hands and feet were whitish . The tail was nearly naked and was light brownish above and lighter below . Goldman wrote that the specimens in the USNM were rather more reddish , but their color may have been altered because they had been preserved in alcohol . Coues had described these as rusty brown above and washed with the same color below . Andrew Arata compared the USNM specimens with examples of the reddish Florida subspecies of the marsh rice rat , Oryzomys palustris natator , for Ray and found that they were more reddish than even the most strongly colored animals from Florida . 
 The skull was generally similar to that of Oryzomys couesi , as were the teeth . It was robust and bore well @-@ developed supraorbital ridges ( located above the eyes ) on the braincase . The interparietal bone , part of the roof of the braincase , was small and narrow . The bony palate extended beyond the third molars . The nasal bones extended further back than the premaxillaries , whereas these bones are usually about coterminous in O. couesi . On average , the incisive foramina , which perforate the front part of the palate , were shorter than in O. couesi . The zygomatic arch ( cheekbone ) appears to have been better developed in O. antillarum . 
 In the three modern and numerous cave specimens , condylobasal length ( a measure of skull length ) varies from 28 @.@ 9 to 31 @.@ 2 mm ( 1 @.@ 14 to 1 @.@ 23 in ) ( one modern and two cave specimens only ) , length of the bony palate from 13 @.@ 0 to 17 @.@ 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 51 to 0 @.@ 70 in ) , width of the interorbital region ( located between the eyes ) from 4 @.@ 78 to 6 @.@ 33 mm ( 0 @.@ 188 to 0 @.@ 249 in ) , length of the incisive foramina from 5 @.@ 1 to 6 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 to 0 @.@ 26 in ) , crown length of the upper molars from 4 @.@ 36 to 5 @.@ 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 172 to 0 @.@ 205 in ) , and crown length of the lower molars from 4 @.@ 80 to 5 @.@ 39 mm ( 0 @.@ 189 to 0 @.@ 212 in ) .

However , a site ( Wallingford Roadside Cave ) from the last interglacial , the Eemian , contains only the hystricognath rodents <unk> and <unk> browni and lacks Oryzomys . The presence of the rice rat on Jamaica before the arrival of humans disproves the hypothesis that it was introduced ; instead , it must have reached the island by overwater dispersal through a rafting event , probably less than 125 @,@ 000 years ago . During the last glacial period , low sea levels would have exposed much land between Jamaica and Central America , substantially decreasing the distance needed for the ancestor of O. antillarum to arrive on the island and probably influencing sea currents so that rafts of vegetation from Central America would be more likely to reach Jamaica . Species of Oryzomys are semiaquatic and closely associated with water , which may help to explain the occurrence of the genus on Jamaica . The rice rat has been found in many superficial , late Holocene cave deposits , some of which have been radiocarbon dated to within the last 1 @,@ 100 years . Its remains also occur in some Amerindian archeological sites . From its common and widespread occurrence in caves , Ray suggested that the rice rat occurred in many different habitats before European contact . O. antillarum was the only sigmodontine rodent on any of the Greater Antilles , where the rodent fauna otherwise consists solely of hystricognaths and introduced rodents . 
 = = = Historical records = = = 
 Although there are some early historical records of the rats of Jamaica , very little is to be found in them regarding Oryzomys antillarum , perhaps because the species declined rapidly following the European colonization of the island and because early authors failed to distinguish it from introduced rodents ( the black rat , Rattus rattus ; brown rat , Rattus norvegicus ; and house mouse , Mus musculus ) . Patrick Browne , in the 1756 Civil and Natural History of Jamaica , described a " House and Cane @-@ Rat " , a " Mouse " , and a large " Water @-@ Rat " , which he said had been introduced to the island and become very common there . 
 In his History of Jamaica ( 1774 ) , Edward Long recognized four Jamaican rats : Browne 's " Water @-@ Rat " , termed the " Charles @-@ price rat " , which Long regarded as identical with the European water vole ( Arvicola ) ; the " black house @-@ rat " , said to have been brought from England ; and two he said were indigenous . The larger of those was a grayish " cane @-@ rat " and the smaller was a reddish " field @-@ rat " as large as the English mole ( the European mole , <unk> europaea ) . Ray considered that the last may simply have been the house mouse , since the size of an English mole would be too small for Oryzomys . 
 In A Naturalist 's Sojourn in Jamaica ( 1851 ) , Philip Henry Gosse listed the black and brown rat and the house mouse , as well as the " Cane @-@ piece Rat " , which he described as Mus <unk> and regarded as probably identical with Browne 's " Water @-@ Rat " and Long 's " Charles @-@ price Rat " . He also mentioned the two species Long had listed as indigenous . Thomas and Ray both asserted that this " Cane @-@ piece Rat " was most likely a brown rat , as judged from its measurements . Gosse wrote that an early explorer , Anthony Robinson , had described and pictured this species in an unpublished manuscript , on the basis of a specimen 20 inches ( 51 cm ) long , half of which consisted of the tail . Ray was unable to examine Robinson 's manuscript , but suggested that Robinson 's rat could not have been the brown rat , because that species did not reach the Americas until about 1800 , and may instead have been O. antillarum . 
 Gosse had collected the British Museum specimen of Oryzomys antillarum in 1845 , but may not have separated it from introduced rats found with it . Coues noted that the two USNM specimens he examined were received after he had written the preceding part of his monograph ; later , Thomas and others wrote that these specimens were obtained around 1877 , but Ray asserted that they were taken before 1874 . No specimens have been collected since . 
 = = = Extinction = = = 
 Oryzomys antillarum probably became extinct about the 1870s and is currently listed as such by the IUCN Red List . Its disappearance is usually attributed to the small Asian mongoose ( Herpestes javanicus ) , which was introduced to Jamaica in 1872 , and sometimes also to introduced Rattus species . Ray , on the other hand , argued that the significance of the mongoose had been overrated . Instead , he suggested that Oryzomys antillarum may have been affected by the massive environmental changes that occurred on the island after the British takeover in 1655 . In that period , the bulk of the island came to be used for cultivation , so that the native habitat of Oryzomys was destroyed . Thus , Oryzomys was reduced to competition with introduced rats in man @-@ made habitats , to which the latter are well adapted . Perhaps , Ray wrote , the black rat may not have been able to extirpate Oryzomys , but the brown rat , a later and more assertive invader , brought it to extinction . Cats and dogs preying on Oryzomys may also have contributed to its demise . 
 = AHS Centaur = 
 Australian Hospital Ship ( AHS ) Centaur was a hospital ship which was attacked and sunk by a Japanese submarine off the coast of Queensland , Australia , on 14 May 1943 . Of the 332 medical personnel and civilian crew aboard , 268 died , including 63 of the 65 army personnel . 
 The Scottish @-@ built vessel was launched in 1924 as a combination passenger liner and refrigerated cargo ship and operated a trade route between Western Australia and Singapore via the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) , carrying passengers , cargo , and livestock . At the start of World War II , Centaur ( like all British Merchant Navy vessels ) was placed under British Admiralty control , but after being fitted with defensive equipment , was allowed to continue normal operations . In November 1941 , the ship rescued German survivors of the engagement between Kormoran and HMAS Sydney . Centaur was relocated to Australia 's east coast in October 1942 , and used to transport materiel to New Guinea . 
 In January 1943 , Centaur was handed over to the Australian military for conversion into a hospital ship , as the ship 's small size made her suitable for operating in Maritime Southeast Asia . The refit ( including installation of medical facilities and repainting with Red Cross markings ) was completed in March , and the ship undertook a trial voyage : transporting wounded from Townsville to Brisbane , then from Port Moresby to Brisbane . After replenishing in Sydney , Centaur embarked the 2 / 12th Field Ambulance for transport to New Guinea , and sailed on 12 May . Before dawn on 14 May 1943 , during her second voyage , Centaur was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine off North Stradbroke Island , Queensland . The majority of the 332 aboard died in the attack ; the 64 survivors were discovered 36 hours later . The incident resulted in public outrage as attacking a hospital ship is considered a war crime under the tenth 1907 Hague Convention . Protests were made by the Australian and British governments to Japan and efforts were made to discover the people responsible so they could be tried at a war crimes tribunal . In the 1970s the probable identity of the attacking submarine , I @-@ 177 , became public . 
 The reason for the attack is unknown , with theories that Centaur was in breach of the international conventions that should have protected her , that I @-@ 177 's commander was unaware that Centaur was a hospital ship , or that the submarine commander knowingly attacked a protected vessel . Claims of discovery were made in 1995 , but that wreck was proven in 2003 to be another ship . The wreck of Centaur was found on 20 December 2009 .

 In early 1923 , the Ocean Steamship Company ( a subsidiary of Alfred Holt 's Blue Funnel Line ) decided that a new vessel would be required to replace the ageing Charon on the Western Australia to Singapore trade route . The vessel had to be capable of simultaneously transporting passengers , cargo , and livestock . She also had to be capable of resting on mud flats out of the water as the tidal variance in ports at the northern end of Western Australia was as great as 8 metres ( 26 ft ) . 
 Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Greenock was chosen to build Centaur . The ship 's keel was laid on 16 November 1923 , with the ship ready for collection by 29 August 1924 . Constructed at a cost of £ 146 @,@ 750 sterling , Centaur was designed to carry 72 passengers and 450 cattle . Cargo was carried in four holds ; the two decks within the hull were primarily for livestock , and could also be used as additional cargo space . The hull of the ship was a ' turret deck ' design ; decks below the waterline were wider than those above water , and a flat , reinforced hull allowed the ship to rest on the bottom . Centaur was among the first civilian vessels to be equipped with a diesel engine . One of the most visible characteristics was the 35 @-@ foot ( 11 m ) smokestack , the extreme size was more a concession to tradition than of practical advantage on a diesel @-@ powered vessel . Her engine was 6 @-@ cylinder 4 @-@ stroke , single cycle single action diesel engine . It had cylinders of <unk> ⁄ 16 inches ( 64 cm ) diameter by 513 ⁄ 16 inches ( 135 cm ) stroke . The engine was built by Burmeister & Wain , Copenhagen , Denmark . One of her holds was fitted with refrigeration equipment . The refrigerant was brine and the insulation was cork . The refrigerated hold had a capacity of 3 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 85 m3 ) . 
 In December 1939 , Centaur underwent a minor refit in Hong Kong , with a supercharger and a new propeller fitted to the engine . The supercharger broke down in April 1942 , and could not be repaired because of equipment shortages and restricted dockyard access caused by World War II . 
 = = = Hospital ship refit = = = 
 At the beginning of 1943 , Centaur was placed at the disposal of the Australian Department of Defence for conversion to a hospital ship . The conversion was performed by United Ship Services in Melbourne , Australia , and was initially estimated to cost AU £ 20 @,@ 000 . 
 The cost increased to almost AU £ 55 @,@ 000 , for a variety of reasons . It was originally intended for the ship to travel between ports in New Guinea and Townsville , Queensland , Australia . Increasing casualty numbers in the New Guinea campaign meant that the hospitals in Queensland would quickly become unable to deal with the quantity of the casualties and the nature of their injuries , so a longer voyage to Sydney was required . The Army demanded that additional facilities and conversions be added to the original plans such as expanded bathing and washing facilities , hot water made available to all parts of the ship through installation of a <unk> , the rerouting of all steam pipes away from patient areas , and ventilation arrangements suitable for tropical conditions . The unions representing the ship 's crew requested improved living and dining conditions , including new sinks in the food preparation areas and the replacement of flooring in the quarters and mess rooms . 
 When AHS Centaur was relaunched on 12 March 1943 , she was equipped with an operating theatre , dispensary , two wards ( located on the former cattle decks ) , and a dental surgery , along with quarters for seventy five crew and sixty five permanent Army medical staff . To maintain the ship 's mean draught of 6 @.@ 1 metres ( 20 ft ) , 900 tons of ironstone were distributed through the cargo holds as ballast . AHS Centaur was capable of voyages of 18 days before resupply and could carry just over 250 bedridden patients .

 Centaur was allocated the United Kingdom Official Number <unk> and the Code Letters <unk> . Her port of registry was Liverpool . When Centaur entered service at the end of 1924 , the Fremantle – Java – Singapore trade route was being serviced by two other Blue Funnel Line vessels ; Gorgon ( which remained in service until 1928 ) and Charon ( which Centaur was replacing ) . Centaur 's route ran from Fremantle up the Western Australian coast calling at Geraldton , Carnarvon , Onslow , Point Samson , Port Hedland , Broome , and Derby then to the Bali Strait , Surabaya , Semarang , Batavia , and Singapore . Centaur operated as a cross between a tramp steamer and a freight liner ; she travelled a set route , but stops at ports along the route varied between journeys . From 1928 until sometime in the 1930s , Centaur remained alone on her route , but the increase in trade along this route prompted Blue Funnel Line to reassign Gorgon and assign the new Charon to work alongside Centaur . 
 Following the change in Code Letters in 1934 , Centaur was allocated the Code Letters <unk> . A highlight of Centaur 's pre @-@ war career was the rescue of the 385 ton Japanese whale @-@ chaser Kyo Maru II in November 1938 . Kyo Maru II had developed boiler problems while returning from the Antarctic and was drifting towards the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago , where she was in danger of being wrecked by the reefs in the area . Centaur responded to the distress signal and towed Kyo Maru II to Geraldton .

 As a vessel of the British Merchant Navy , Centaur was affected by the British Parliament 's 1939 outline of how the Merchant Navy would respond to the declaration of war , primarily submission to the Admiralty in all matters excluding the crewing and management of vessels . Following the outbreak of World War II on 3 September 1939 , Centaur was equipped with a stern @-@ mounted 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) Mark IX naval gun and two .303 Vickers machine guns located on the bridge wings for protection against Axis warships and aircraft . She was also fitted with port and starboard paravanes and degaussing equipment for protection against naval mines . The weapons were removed during the hospital ship refit , although the anti @-@ mine countermeasures remained . Centaur initially remained in service on her original trade route . 
 On 26 November 1941 , a damaged lifeboat carrying 62 Kriegsmarine ( German navy ) sailors and officers was spotted by an aircraft looking for the missing Australian cruiser HMAS Sydney ; the aircraft directed Centaur to the lifeboat . Upon encountering the lifeboat , food was lowered to its occupants , and one person was allowed on board to explain the situation . Initially posing as a Norwegian merchant navy officer , the man quickly revealed that he was the first officer of the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran and that the lifeboat contained German survivors from Kormoran 's battle with HMAS Sydney seven days earlier , including Captain Theodor Detmers . 
 Unwilling to leave the shipwrecked men at sea , but afraid of having his ship captured by the Germans , Centaur 's master decided to take the lifeboat in tow , after allowing nine wounded men aboard . During the tow towards Carnarvon , Western Australia , the lifeboat was swamped and partially sunk by rough seas , so two of Centaur 's lifeboats were lowered to carry the Germans . On arrival in Carnarvon , the Germans were relocated to the number one cargo hold , where they were joined by another hundred Kormoran survivors collected by other ships , plus forty Australian Army guards , which were then transported by Centaur to Fremantle . 
 Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the beginning of the Malayan Campaign on 7 December 1941 , Centaur 's run was curtailed to Broome , Western Australia . On 6 October 1942 , Centaur was ordered to sail to Queensland , where she began runs between the east coast of Australia and New Guinea , carrying materiel .

 With the commencement of hostilities between Japan and the British Empire , it became clear that the three hospital ships currently serving Australia — Manunda , Wanganella , and Oranje — would not be able to operate in the shallow waters typical of Maritime Southeast Asia , so a new hospital ship was required . Of the Australian Merchant Navy vessels able to operate in this region , none were suitable for conversion to a hospital ship , and a request to the British Ministry of Shipping placed Centaur at the disposal of the Australian military on 4 January 1943 . The conversion work began on 9 January and Centaur was commissioned as an Australian Hospital Ship on 1 March . During her conversion , Centaur was painted with the markings of a hospital ship as detailed in Article 5 of the tenth Hague Convention of 1907 ( " Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention " ) ; white hull with a green band interspersed by three red crosses on each flank of the hull , white superstructure , multiple large red crosses positioned so that the ship 's status would be visible from both sea and air , and an identification number ( for Centaur , 47 ) on her bows . At night , the markings were illuminated by a combination of internal and external lights . Data on the ship 's markings and the layout of identifying structural features was provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross during the first week of February 1943 , who passed this on to the Japanese on 5 February . This information was also circulated and promoted by the press and media . 
 Centaur entered operation as a hospital ship on 12 March 1943 . The early stages of Centaur 's first voyage as a hospital ship were test and transport runs ; the initial run from Melbourne to Sydney resulted in the Master , Chief Engineer , and Chief Medical Officer composing a long list of defects requiring attention . Following repairs , she conducted a test run , transporting wounded servicemen from Townsville to Brisbane to ensure that she was capable of fulfilling the role of a medical vessel . Centaur was then tasked with delivering medical personnel to Port Moresby , New Guinea , and returning to Brisbane with Australian and American wounded along with a small number of wounded Japanese prisoners of war . 
 Arriving in Sydney on 8 May 1943 , Centaur was re @-@ provisioned at Darling Harbour , before departing for Cairns , Queensland on 12 May 1943 . From there , her destination was again New Guinea . On board at the time were 74 civilian crew , 53 Australian Army Medical Corps personnel ( including 8 officers ) , 12 female nurses from the Australian Army Nursing Service , 192 soldiers from the 2 / 12th Field Ambulance , and one Torres Strait ship pilot . Most of the female nurses had transferred from the hospital ship Oranje , and the male Army personnel assigned to the ship aboard were all medical staff . During the loading process , there was an incident when the ambulance drivers attached to the 2 / 12th attempted to bring their rifles and personal supplies of ammunition aboard . This was met with disapproval from Centaur 's Master and Chief Medical Officer , and raised concerns amongst the crew and wharf labourers that Centaur would be transporting military supplies or commandos to New Guinea : the rifles were not allowed on board until Centaur 's Master received official reassurance that the ambulance drivers were allowed to carry weapons under the 10th Hague Convention ( specifically Article 8 ) , as they were used " for the maintenance of order and the defence of the wounded . " The remaining cargo was searched by the crew and labourers for additional weapons and munitions . 
 = = Sinking = = 
 At approximately 4 : 10 am on 14 May 1943 , while on her second run from Sydney to Port Moresby , Centaur was torpedoed by an unsighted submarine . The torpedo struck the portside oil fuel tank approximately 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) below the waterline , creating a hole 8 to 10 metres ( 26 to 33 ft ) across , igniting the fuel , and setting the ship on fire from the bridge aft . Many of those on board were immediately killed by concussion or perished in the inferno . Centaur quickly took on water through the impact site , rolled to port , then sank bow @-@ first , submerging completely in less than three minutes . The rapid sinking prevented the deployment of lifeboats , although two broke off from Centaur as she sank , along with several damaged <unk> . 
 According to the position extrapolated by Second Officer Gordon Rippon from the 4 : 00 am dead reckoning position , Centaur was attacked approximately 24 nautical miles ( 44 km ; 28 mi ) east @-@ northeast of Point Lookout , North Stradbroke Island , Queensland . Doubts were initially cast on the accuracy of both the calculated point of sinking and the dead reckoning position , but the 2009 discovery of the wreck found both to be correct , with Centaur located within 1 nautical mile ( 1 @.@ 9 km ; 1 @.@ 2 mi ) of Rippon 's coordinates . 
 = = = Survivors = = = 
 Of the 332 people on board , 64 were rescued . Most of the crew and passengers were asleep at the time of attack and had little chance to escape . It was estimated that up to 200 people may have been alive at the time Centaur submerged . Several who made it off the ship later died from shrapnel wounds or burns ; others were unable to find support and drowned . 
 The survivors spent 36 hours in the water , using barrels , wreckage , and the two damaged lifeboats for flotation . During this time , they drifted approximately 19 @.@ 6 nautical miles ( 36 @.@ 3 km ; 22 @.@ 6 mi ) north east of Centaur 's calculated point of sinking and spread out over an area of 2 nautical miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ; 2 @.@ 3 mi ) . The survivors saw at least four ships and several aircraft , but could not attract their attention . 
 At the time of rescue , the survivors were in two large and three small groups , with several more floating alone . Amongst those rescued were Sister Ellen Savage , the only surviving nurse from 12 aboard ; Leslie <unk> , the only surviving doctor from 18 aboard ; Gordon Rippon , second officer and most senior surviving crewmember ; and Richard Salt , the Torres Strait ship pilot . In 1944 , Ellen Savage was presented with the George Medal for providing medical care , boosting morale , and displaying courage during the wait for rescue .

 On the morning of 15 May 1943 , the American destroyer USS Mugford departed Brisbane to escort the 11 @,@ 063 ton New Zealand freighter Sussex on the first stage of the latter 's trans @-@ Tasman voyage . At 2 : 00 pm , a lookout aboard Mugford reported an object on the horizon . Around the same time , a Royal Australian Air Force Avro Anson of No. 71 Squadron , flying ahead on anti @-@ submarine watch , dived towards the object . The aircraft returned to the two ships and signalled that there were shipwreck survivors in the water requiring rescue . Mugford 's commanding officer ordered Sussex to continue alone as Mugford collected the survivors . Marksmen were positioned around the ship to shoot sharks , and sailors stood ready to dive in and assist the wounded . Mugford 's medics inspected each person as they came aboard and provided necessary medical care . The American crew learned from the first group of survivors that they were from the hospital ship Centaur . 
 At 2 : 14 pm , Mugford made contact with the Naval Officer @-@ in @-@ Charge in Brisbane , and announced that the ship was recovering survivors from Centaur at 27 ° 03 ′ S 154 ° 12 ′ E , the first that anyone in Australia had knowledge of the attack on the hospital ship . The rescue of the 64 survivors took an hour and twenty minutes , although Mugford remained in the area until dark , searching an area of approximately 7 by 14 nautical miles ( 13 by 26 km ; 8 by 16 mi ) for more survivors . After darkness fell , Mugford returned to Brisbane , arriving shortly before midnight . Further searches of the waters off North Stradbroke Island were made by USS Helm during the night of 15 May until 6 : 00 pm on 16 May , and by HMAS Lithgow and four motor torpedo boats from 16 to 21 May , with neither search finding more survivors . 
 = = = Attacker = = = 
 At the time of the attack , none aboard Centaur witnessed what had attacked the ship . Due to the ship 's position , the distance from shore , and the depth , it was concluded that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to be operating off the Australian east coast . Several survivors later claimed to have heard the attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were adrift , and the submarine was seen by the ship 's cook , Francis Martin , who was floating alone on a hatch cover , out of sight from the main cluster of survivors . Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors ' return to land ; his description matched the profile of a KD7 type Kaidai @-@ class submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy . 
 At the time of the attack , three KD7 Kaidai were operating off Australia 's east coast : I @-@ 177 under the command of Hajime Nakagawa , I @-@ 178 under <unk> <unk> , and I @-@ 180 under Toshio Kusaka . None of these submarines survived the war ; I @-@ 177 was sunk by USS Samuel S. Miles on 3 October 1944 , I @-@ 178 by USS Patterson on 25 August 1943 , and I @-@ 180 by USS Gilmore on 26 April 1944 . Kusaka and Nakagawa were transferred to other submarines before the loss of I @-@ 180 and I @-@ 177 respectively , but <unk> and I @-@ 178 were sunk while returning from the patrol off the coast of Australia . 
 In December 1943 , following official protests , the Japanese government issued a statement formally denying responsibility for the sinking of Centaur . Records provided by the Japanese following the war also did not acknowledge responsibility . Although Centaur 's sinking was a war crime , no one was tried for sinking the hospital ship . Investigations into the attack were conducted between 1944 and 1948 , and included the interrogation of the commanders of the submarines operating in Australian waters at the time , their superiors , plus junior officers and crewmen from the submarines who had survived the war . Several of the investigators suspected that Nakagawa and I @-@ 177 were most likely responsible , but they were unable to establish this beyond reasonable doubt , and the Centaur case file was closed on 14 December 1948 without any charges laid . 
 Historians were divided on which submarine was responsible . In Royal Australian Navy , 1942 – 1945 , published in 1968 as part of the series detailing the Australian official history of World War II , George Hermon Gill concluded that either I @-@ 178 or I @-@ 180 was responsible ; the former was more likely as she had served in Australian waters the longest of any Japanese submarine at the time , but had claimed no kills in the three @-@ month period surrounding Centaur 's sinking . In 1972 , German military historian Jürgen Rohwer claimed in Chronology of the war at sea that I @-@ 177 torpedoed Centaur , based on a Japanese report stating that I @-@ 177 had attacked a ship on 14 May 1943 in the area the hospital ship had sunk . Japanese Rear Admiral <unk> Sakamoto , who had shown Rohwer the report , stated that Nakagawa and I @-@ 177 were responsible for the attack on Centaur in his 1979 book History of Submarine Warfare . 
 As an official history of the Japanese Navy , Sakamoto 's work was considered to be official admission of the attacking submarine 's identity . Subsequently , most sources assumed as fact Nakagawa 's and I @-@ 177 's role in the loss of Centaur . Nakagawa refused to speak on the subject of the attack on Centaur following the war crimes investigation at the end of World War II , even to defend himself or deny the claims made by Rohwer 's and Sakamoto 's works , and died in 1991 . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 = = = Public reaction = = = 
 The media were notified of Centaur 's sinking on 17 May 1943 , but were ordered not to release the news until it had been announced in the South West Pacific Area 's General Headquarters dispatch at midday on 18 May , and in Parliament by Prime Minister John Curtin that afternoon . News of the attack made front pages throughout the world , including The Times of London , The New York Times , and the Montreal Gazette . In some newspapers , the news took precedence over the ' Dambuster ' raids performed in Europe by No. 617 Squadron RAF . 
 The initial public reaction to the attack on Centaur was one of outrage , significantly different from that displayed following the loss of Australian warships or merchant vessels . As a hospital ship , the attack was a breach of the tenth Hague Convention of 1907 , and as such was a war crime . The sinking of Centaur drew strong reactions from both Prime Minister Curtin and General Douglas MacArthur . Curtin stated that the sinking was " an entirely inexcusable act , undertaken in violation of the convention to which Japan is a party and of all the principles of common humanity " . MacArthur reflected the common Australian view when he stated that the sinking was an example of Japanese " limitless savagery " . Politicians urged the public to use their rage to fuel the war effort , and Centaur became a symbol of Australia 's determination to defeat what appeared to be a brutal and uncompromising enemy . The Australian Government produced posters depicting the sinking , which called for Australians to " Avenge the Nurses " by working to produce materiel , purchasing war bonds , or enlisting in the armed forces . 
 People also expressed their sympathy towards the crew , with several efforts to fund a new hospital ship established . The councillors of Caulfield , Victoria , organised a fund to replace the lost medical equipment , opening with a donation of AU £ 2 @,@ 000 . Those who worked on Centaur 's conversion contributed money towards a replacement , and employees of Ansett Airways pledged to donate an hour 's pay towards the fitting out of such a replacement . 
 With some people unable to believe that the Japanese would be so ruthless , rumours began to spread almost immediately after news of the attack was made public . The most common rumour was that Centaur had been carrying munitions or commandos at the time of her sinking , with the Japanese made aware of this prior to her departure . This stemmed from an incident involving the ambulance drivers ' weapons during loading in Sydney . 
 = = = Military reaction = = = 
 The attack was universally condemned by Australian servicemen , who commonly believed that the attack on Centaur had been carried out deliberately and in full knowledge of her status . Similar reactions were expressed by other Allied personnel ; United States Army Air Forces General George Kenney recalled having to talk a sergeant bombardier out of organising a retaliatory bombing run on a Japanese hospital ship known to be in their area . 
 Six days after the attack on Centaur , a request was made by the Australian Department of Defence that the identification markings and lights be removed from Australian hospital ship Manunda , weapons be installed , and that she begin to sail blacked out and under escort . The conversion was performed , although efforts by the Department of the Navy , the Admiralty , and authorities in New Zealand and the United States of America caused the completed conversion to be undone . The cost of the roundabout work came to £ 12 @,@ 500 , and kept Manunda out of service for three months . On 9 June 1943 , communications between the Combined Chiefs of Staff on the subject of hospital ships contained a section referring to the Manunda incident as a response to the attack on Centaur , with the conclusion that the attack was the work of an irresponsible Japanese commander , and that it would be better to wait until further attacks had been made before considering the removal of hospital ship markings . 
 When the consideration was made that the ambulance drivers ' weapons incident just prior to Centaur 's voyage may have been partially responsible for the attack , it led to the tightening of rules regarding who was allowed to travel on a hospital ship . Quasi @-@ medical staff , like repatriation teams , were no longer permitted on hospital ships . Ambulance drivers had to transfer from the regular Army to the Australian Army Medical Corps before they were allowed aboard , although they were still permitted to carry their unloaded weapons and ammunition . 
 = = = Official protests = = = 
 After consultation with the Australian armed forces , General MacArthur , the Admiralty , and the Australian Government , an official protest was sent . This was received by the Japanese Government on 29 May 1943 . At around the same time , the International Committee of the Red Cross sent a protest on behalf of the major Allied Red Cross organisations to the Japanese Red Cross . 
 On 26 December 1943 , a response to the Australian protest arrived . It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying the allegation made , and therefore took no responsibility for what happened . The reply counter @-@ protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies , although these claims were directed against the United States , not Australia . Although several later exchanges were made , the lack of progress saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur .

 = = = Overview = = = 
 Torpedo attacks in Australian waters were common at this time , with 27 Japanese submarines operating in Australian waters between June 1942 and December 1944 . These submarines attacked almost 50 merchant vessels , with 20 ships confirmed to be sunk as result of a Japanese attack , plus 9 more unconfirmed . This was part of a concentrated effort to disrupt supply convoys from Australia to New Guinea . 
 Several actions on Centaur 's part may have contributed to her demise . Centaur was under orders to sail well out to sea until reaching the Great Barrier Reef ; her course keeping her between 50 and 150 nautical miles ( 90 and 280 km ; 60 and 170 mi ) from shore . Centaur 's Master , believing he had been given a route intended for a merchant vessel , set a course closer to land , but on the seaward side of 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) in depth . Also , Centaur was sailing completely illuminated , with the exception of the two bow floodlights , which had been switched off as they interfered with visibility from the bridge . 
 There are three main theories as to why Centaur was attacked : 
 = = = Theory : Centaur was believed to be a legitimate target = = = 
 This theory stems from the various rumours spreading after Centaur 's sinking . If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907 , and someone had informed the Japanese of this , I @-@ 177 may have been under valid orders to attack . When Centaur left Sydney , her decks were packed with green @-@ uniformed men , and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat , a distant observer could have concluded that the hospital ship was transporting soldiers . Those witnessing the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard , and could have come to a similar conclusion . If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese , I @-@ 177 could have been lying in wait . The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that Centaur was taking an alternative route and how they were able to determine the new route selected . 
 Similar but later rumours included that during her first voyage , Centaur had transported soldiers to New Guinea , or Japanese prisoners of war back to Australia for interrogation , and consequently had been marked as a legitimate target by the Japanese . Centaur had carried 10 prisoners of war on her return voyage from New Guinea , but as they were all wounded personnel , transporting them on a hospital ship was legal . 
 = = = Theory : Nakagawa was unaware that Centaur was a hospital ship = = = 
 This theory states that Nakagawa was unaware that the vessel he was attacking was a hospital ship , and that the sinking was an unfortunate accident . This view was supported by several Japanese officers , both before and after the revelation that Nakagawa was responsible . Amongst them was Lieutenant Commander <unk> <unk> , who took command of I @-@ 177 after Nakagawa . <unk> did not hear anything from the crew about having sunk a hospital ship , not even rumours , and believed that if I @-@ 177 had knowingly attacked Centaur , he would have learned this from the crew 's gossip . 
 When compared to the other contemporary Australian hospital ships , Centaur was the smallest , approximately a third of the size of Manunda or Wanganella . Centaur was also slightly shorter than I @-@ 177 . The observation of Centaur was made through a periscope , and submarine officers attest that at 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) , the optimum range of attack for World War II – era Japanese submarines , some officers would not be able to clearly identify a target ship 's profile or hull markings . With Centaur 's bow floodlights out , and with the observation of the target made through the periscope , there is a possibility Nakagawa would not have seen the hospital ship 's markings if he had been in the wrong position . Apart from the two bow floodlights , Centaur was lit up brilliantly . To attack , I @-@ 177 would have had to approach from abeam of Centaur , which was illuminated by both its own lights and a full moon . 
 = = = Theory : Nakagawa knowingly attacked a protected vessel = = = 
 This theory states that Nakagawa was fully aware that his target was a hospital ship and decided to sink her regardless , either on his own initiative or on a poor interpretation of his orders . Researchers speculate that as Nakagawa was approaching the end of his tour in Australian waters , and had only sunk a single enemy vessel , the 8 @,@ 742 ton freighter Limerick , he did not want to return with the disgrace of a single kill . Other claims include that Nakagawa may have been acting in vengeance for casualties inflicted by the Allies during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , or may have expected praise for the sinking of an enemy naval vessel . 
 In February 1944 , while in command of I @-@ 37 , Nakagawa ordered the machine @-@ gunning of survivors from three British merchant vessels torpedoed by his submarine ( British Chivalry , on 22 February ; Sutlej , on 24 February ; and <unk> , on 29 February ) . His defence , that he was acting under orders from Vice Admiral Shiro Takasu , was not accepted , and he was sentenced to four years imprisonment at Sugamo Prison as a Class B war criminal . These incidents showed that Nakagawa was willing to ignore the laws of war . 
 = = Shipwreck = = 
 Following World War II , several searches of the waters around North Stradbroke and Moreton Islands failed to reveal Centaur 's location . It was believed that she had sunk off the edge of the continental shelf , to a depth at which the Royal Australian Navy did not have the capability to search for a vessel of Centaur 's size . Some parties also believed that Rippon 's calculated point of sinking was inaccurate , either intentionally or through error . 
 Several points were incorrectly identified as the location where Centaur sank . The first was in the War Diary Situation Report entry for the hospital ship 's sinking , which gives 27 ° 17 ′ S 154 ° 05 ′ E , 7 nautical miles ( 13 km ; 8 @.@ 1 mi ) east of Rippon 's position . According to Milligan and Foley , this likely occurred because an estimated 50 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 93 km ; 58 mi ) distance from Brisbane , included as a frame of reference , was interpreted literally . In 1974 , two divers claimed to have found the ship approximately 40 nautical miles ( 74 km ; 46 mi ) east of Brisbane , in 60 metres ( 200 ft ) of water , but did not disclose its exact location . Attempts to relocate the site between 1974 and 1992 were unsuccessful , with an associate of the divers claiming that the Navy destroyed the wreck shortly after its discovery . 
 = = = Dennis 's claim = = = 
 In 1995 , it was announced that the shipwreck of Centaur had been located in waters 9 nautical miles ( 17 km ; 10 mi ) from the lighthouse on Moreton Island , a significant distance from her believed last position . The finding was reported on A Current Affair , during which footage of the shipwreck , 170 metres ( 560 ft ) underwater , was shown . Discoverer Donald Dennis claimed the identity of the shipwreck had been confirmed by the Navy , the Queensland Maritime Museum , and the Australian War Memorial . A cursory search by the Navy confirmed the presence of a shipwreck at the given location , which was gazetted as a war grave and added to navigation charts by the Australian Hydrographic Office . 
 Over the next eight years , there was growing doubt about the position of Dennis ' wreck , due to the distance from both Second Officer Rippon 's calculation of the point of sinking and where USS Mugford found the survivors . During this time , Dennis had been convicted on two counts of deception and one of theft through scams . Two wreck divers , Trevor Jackson and Simon Mitchell , used the location for a four @-@ hour world record dive on 14 May 2002 , during which they examined the wreck and took measurements , claiming that the ship was too small to be Centaur . Jackson had been studying Centaur for some time , and believed that the wreck was actually another , much smaller ship , the 55 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 180 ft ) MV <unk> , a lime freighter purchased by the Royal Australian Air Force and sunk during bombing practice on 12 May 1951 . The facts gathered on the dive were inconclusive , but the divers remained adamant it was not Centaur , and passed this information onto Nick Greenaway , producer of the newsmagazine show 60 Minutes . 
 On the 60th anniversary of the sinking , 60 Minutes ran a story demonstrating that the wreck was not Centaur . It was revealed that nobody at the Queensland Maritime Museum had yet seen Dennis ' footage , and when it was shown to Museum president Rod McLeod and maritime historian John Foley , they stated that the shipwreck could not be Centaur due to physical inconsistencies , such as an incorrect rudder . Following this story , and others published around the same time in newspapers , the Navy sent three ships to inspect the site over a two @-@ month period ; HMA Ships Hawkesbury , Melville , and Yarra , before concluding that the shipwreck was incorrectly identified as Centaur . An amendment was made to the <unk> , and the Hydrographic Office began to remove the mark from charts . 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 In April 2008 , following the successful discovery of HMAS Sydney , several parties began calling for a dedicated search for Centaur . By the end of 2008 , the Australian Federal and Queensland State governments had formed a joint committee and contributed A $ 2 million each towards a search , and tenders to supply equipment ( including the search vessel , side @-@ scan sonar systems , and a remotely operated inspection submersible ) were opened in February 2009 , and awarded during the year . The search , conducted from the Defence Maritime Services vessel Seahorse Spirit and overseen by shipwreck hunter David Mearns , commenced during the weekend of 12 – 13 December 2009 . The initial search area off Cape Moreton covered 1 @,@ 365 square kilometres ( 527 sq mi ) , with the search team given 35 days to locate and film the wreck before funding was exhausted . 
 Six sonar targets with similar dimensions to Centaur were located between 15 and 18 December : as none of the contacts corresponded completely to the hospital ship , the search team opted to take advantage of favourable weather conditions and continue investigating the area before returning to each site and making a detailed inspection with a higher @-@ resolution sonar . On the afternoon of 18 December , the sonar <unk> separated from the cable , and was lost in 1 @,@ 800 metres ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) of water , forcing the use of the high @-@ resolution sonar to complete the area search . After inspecting the potential targets , Mearns and the search team announced on 20 December that they had found Centaur that morning . 
 The wreck was found at 27 ° 16 @.@ 98 ′ S 153 ° 59 @.@ 22 ′ E ( 30 nautical miles ( 56 km ; 35 mi ) east of Moreton Island , and less than 1 nautical mile ( 1 @.@ 9 km ; 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from Rippon 's coordinates ) , resting 2 @,@ 059 metres ( 6 @,@ 755 ft ) below sea level in a steep @-@ walled gully , 150 metres ( 490 ft ) wide and 90 metres ( 300 ft ) deep . After returning to shore for Christmas and to install a remotely operated vehicle ( ROV ) aboard Seahorse Spirit , the search team commenced efforts to document the wreck , with the first photographs taken by the ROV in the early morning of 10 January 2010 confirming that the wreck is Centaur . Conditions for documenting the hospital ship were not optimal on the first ROV dive , and three more dives were made during 11 and 12 January . During the four dives , over 24 hours of footage were collected , along with numerous photographs : features identified during the operation include the Red Cross identification number , the hospital ship markings , and the ship 's bell . The Centaur wreck site has been marked as a war grave and protected with a navigational exclusion zone under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 . 
 = = Memorials = = 
 In 1948 , Queensland nurses established the " Centaur Memorial Fund for Nurses " which used the money raised to purchase an establishment and name it " Centaur House " ; a facility supporting nurses by holding convivial meetings and providing inexpensive accommodation for out @-@ of @-@ town nurses . The original Centaur House was sold in 1971 , with a new building purchased and renamed . The second Centaur House was sold in 1979 and although the fund still exists , it no longer owns a physical facility . On 15 September 1968 , a cairn was unveiled at Caloundra , Queensland , erected by the local Rotary International Club . In 1990 , a stained glass memorial window depicting Centaur , along with a plaque listing the names of those lost in the attack , was installed at Concord Repatriation General Hospital , at a cost of A $ 16 @,@ 000 . A display about Centaur was placed at the Australian War Memorial . The centrepiece of the display was a scale model of Centaur presented to the Memorial by Blue Funnel Line , and the display included items that were donated by the survivors , such as a lifejacket , a signal flare , and a medical kit . It was removed in 1992 to make way for a display related to the Vietnam War . 
 A memorial to Centaur was unveiled at Point Danger , <unk> , Queensland on 14 May 1993 , the 50th anniversary of the sinking . It consists of a monumental stone topped with a cairn , surrounded by a tiled moat with memorial plaques explaining the commemoration . The memorial is surrounded by a park with a boardwalk , overlooking the sea , with plaques for other Merchant Navy and Royal Australian Navy vessels lost during World War II . The unveiling of the memorial was performed by Minister for Veterans ' Affairs , Senator John Faulkner . 
 A memorial plaque was laid on the foredeck of Centaur on 12 January 2010 , during the fourth and final ROV dive on the hospital ship . This would normally be a breach of the Historic Shipwrecks Act , but a special dispensation permitted the manoeuvre , as placing the plaque on the seabed next to the ship would have seen it sink into the sediment . Following the ship 's discovery , a national memorial service at St John 's Cathedral , Brisbane on 2 March 2010 was attended by over 600 people , including Prime Minister Kevin Rudd . A second ceremony for 300 relatives of the hospital ship 's personnel was held aboard HMAS Manoora on 24 September . During the service , which occurred over the wreck site , wreaths were laid and the ashes of three survivors were scattered . 
 = Roy Welensky = 
 Sir Roland " Roy " Welensky , KCMG ( né Raphael Welensky ; 20 January 1907 – 5 December 1991 ) was a Northern Rhodesian politician and the second and last prime minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland . 
 Born in Salisbury , Southern Rhodesia ( now Harare , Zimbabwe ) to an Afrikaner mother and a Lithuanian Jewish father , he moved to Northern Rhodesia , became involved with the trade unions , and entered the colonial legislative council in 1938 . There , he campaigned for the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia ( the latter under white self @-@ government , the former under the colonial office ) . Although unsuccessful , he succeeded in the formation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland , a state within the British Empire that sought to retain predominant power for the white minority while moving in a progressive political direction , in contrast to apartheid South Africa . 
 Becoming Prime Minister of the Federation in 1957 , Welensky opposed British moves towards black majority rule , and used force to suppress politically motivated violence in the territories . After the advent of black rule in two of the Federation 's three territories ( Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland , now Zambia and Malawi respectively ) , it collapsed in 1963 . Welensky retired to Salisbury , where he re @-@ entered politics and attempted to stop Rhodesia ( formerly Southern Rhodesia ) from unilaterally declaring itself independent . With the end of white rule in 1979 , and the independence of Rhodesia as Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe in 1980 , Welensky moved to England , where he died in 1991 . A fervent admirer of Britain and the Empire , Welensky described himself as " half Jewish , half Afrikaner [ and ] 100 % British " . 
 = = Youth = = 
 Welensky was born in Pioneer Street , Salisbury , Southern Rhodesia . His father , Michael Welensky ( b. c . 1843 ) , was of Lithuanian Jewish origin , hailing from a village near Wilno ( today Vilnius ) ; a trader in Russia and horse @-@ smuggler during the Franco @-@ Prussian War , he settled in Southern Rhodesia after first emigrating to the United States , where he was a saloon @-@ keeper , and then South Africa . His mother , Leah ( born Aletta Ferreira ; c . 1865 – 1918 ) , was a ninth @-@ generation Afrikaner of Dutch ancestry . His parents , for whom Raphael or " Roy " was the 13th child , kept a " poor white " boarding house . Welensky 's mother died when he was 11 , being treated by Godfrey Huggins , a doctor who was later to become the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia . Although not of British ancestry , Welensky was intensely pro @-@ British , a distinctive sentiment among Rhodesians . John Connell , in his foreword to Welensky 's book 4000 Days , wrote : " Welensky , who had not a drop of British blood in his veins , shared this pride and loyalty [ towards Britain ] to the full . " 
 After leaving school at the age of 14 , Welensky found employment with Rhodesia Railways as a fireman , while putting his physical strength to work as a boxer . He rose through the ranks of Rhodesia Railways to become a locomotive <unk> and became involved in the trade union movement , joining the Rhodesian Railway Workers ' Union . After participating in the unsuccessful 1929 Rhodesian Railways strike Welensky was moved by management to Broken Hill , the main base of the railways in Northern Rhodesia . In 1933 he became Chairman of the Broken Hill branch of the union , and was appointed to the National Council . 
 While working on the railways , he became the professional heavyweight boxing champion of Southern Rhodesia at 19 and held the position until he was 21 . During this time , Welensky met his first wife , Elizabeth Henderson , who was working at a cafe in Bulawayo , Southern Rhodesia at the time . They married after a two @-@ year courtship . 
 = = Colonial politics = = 
 Welensky was elected to the Northern Rhodesian Legislative Council in the 1938 general elections . The Governor prevented Welensky from enlisting in the armed forces in World War II and appointed him Director of Manpower . In 1941 he formed his own party , the Northern Rhodesian Labour Party , with the aim of amalgamating the colony with Southern Rhodesia under a new constitution . The party won all five seats it contested in the 1941 elections . After the leader of the unofficial members in the Legislative Council , Stewart Gore @-@ Browne , resigned in 1945 and stated that black Africans had lost confidence in the whites ( due to the wish for amalgamation ) , Welensky was elected leader . 
 = = Amalgamation and federation = = 
 From the beginning , Welensky was involved in the creation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland . He had earlier wanted an amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia with a constitution similar to that of Southern Rhodesia ( that had granted responsible government to the white Rhodesians ) . After the British Government rejected this idea , he set about the creation of a federation , and against his judgement , the small colony of Nyasaland was included . His main wish for amalgamation , and later federation , was primarily so the complementary economic strengths of the Rhodesias could be put to best use . He felt that the colonies were missing out on the post @-@ war economic boom . 
 To this end , Welensky organised a conference in February 1949 to investigate the idea of a federation . Held at the Victoria Falls Hotel ( a common venue for Rhodesian political conferences ) , representatives from the Northern and Southern Rhodesian Governments were present , but native Africans and the British Government were not . It was agreed that continued pushes for amalgamation would fail , with both the British and native Africans opposed . Welensky suggested that the Constitution of Australia be used as a basis for the proposed federal constitution , and pushed the idea of ' partnership ' between blacks and whites . However , he insisted that " for as long as I can see , in that partnership [ the whites ] will be senior partners " . 
 Apart from organising the federation , Welensky won a significant political battle in Northern Rhodesia against the British South Africa Company ( BSAC ) , which controlled mineral rights and the associated royalties throughout the territory . The company , and not the British crown , had signed the treaties with African kings that surrendered mining rights , but the BSAC had stopped administering Northern Rhodesia in 1924 . Welensky argued that the territory had a right to the royalties , and petitioned the governor to take action . After many talks , the BSAC relented and agreed to surrender mineral rights in 1986 , and to pay 20 % of its profits from these rights to the government until then . 
 In March 1952 , the colonial and the British governments met in London to discuss federation . There , the idea for a federation was finalised and settled , although the colonial governments had , again , insisted on amalgamation . They were rebuffed by the left @-@ leaning public servant ( later Sir ) Andrew Cohen , who , after much deliberation , brought the parties to an agreement . It was acknowledged by those at the meeting that all too often the racial policies of the Rhodesias were confused with the emerging apartheid of South Africa , and Welensky himself claimed to refute these ideas when being interviewed by a South African newspaper . He was paternalistic towards native Africans , but believed in the dictum of " equal rights for all civilised men " and gradual advancement . 
 Behind the scenes , Welensky and the Rhodesians had been courting the Conservatives , while the native Africans had been doing the same with Labour . A British general election was held in 1951 and the Conservatives gained power . Labour , mindful of the overwhelming opposition of Africans from both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and of the Colonial Office mandate to oversee native interests , had been lukewarm at best to the idea of federation , and had been wholly opposed to amalgamation . After the election , the bipartisan approach to federation broke down and the British laws for its creation passed only with the support of the Conservatives , with both Liberal and Labour Parties now opposed . 
 = = Federation established = = 
 Welensky stood for the federal legislature in 1953 for the United Federal Party ( UFP ) , created by himself and Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Godfrey Huggins . The party was successful in its first election , with twice the votes of the opposition Confederate Party . Welensky himself gained more than 80 % of the vote in the federal constituency of Broken Hill and was immediately promoted to Minister for Transport . 
 The first few years of the federation were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and a booming economy . The government 's coffers were kept full through revenue from Northern Rhodesia 's copper mines , and overseas investment saw the rapid expansion of the cities of Salisbury , Bulawayo and Lusaka . High @-@ standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded . Welensky credited the high rate of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance , Donald Macintyre . 
 The Southern Rhodesian Government , under the leadership of Garfield Todd , began removing restrictions imposed on native Africans . The civil service opened more positions to blacks , the title for male Africans was changed from ' AM ' ( African male ) to Mr. , and diners and restaurants were allowed to be multiracial ; Welensky , as Transport Minister , allowed for railway dining cars to be multiracial . However , when it came to liberalising alcohol restrictions on blacks , Welensky argued against doing so , stating that such an action would cause the UFP to lose the next election . After repeated failed attempts to secure Dominion status for the federation , Prime Minister Huggins opted not to stand again for his party 's leadership at their September 1956 conference . In October he resigned and Welensky , the second most senior figure in the federal arena , was chosen to replace him . Welensky took office on 1 November . 
 = = Prime minister = = 
 On taking office , Welensky was forced to take sides in the Suez Crisis . The government of the United Kingdom received heavy international criticism for its actions , but Welensky 's government , with those of Australia and New Zealand , nonetheless stood behind Britain . It was Welensky 's first experience in international politics . In the aftermath of the Suez debacle British colonial policy changed significantly , which would have adverse effects for the federation . It marked the decline of a gradual approach to decolonisation , and a rapid speeding up of the process . Politically , only three years after its founding , the federation began to decline . 
 International attitudes to the federation were critical , particularly from the Afro @-@ Asian bloc in the United Nations . At a time when most colonial powers were rushing their colonies towards independence , the federation seemed to its opponents to be an unwelcome obstacle . In Britain , Labour grew more critical , and African nationalists in the federation itself became more vocal , dissatisfied with the liberalisation that was taking place , and demanding faster moves towards African advancement . The Governor of Northern Rhodesia , Sir Arthur Benson , wrote a secret letter to his superiors in Britain , highly critical of Welensky and the federation ; this letter remained undiscovered until 1958 , when Huggins revealed it to Welensky . 
 = = = Nyasaland unrest = = = 
 The Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox @-@ Boyd visited the federation in January 1957 , while Welensky prepared to outline the difficulties regarding African advancement . Seeking to bring Africans into the established political processes , and hoping they would shun the recently formed African National Congress ( ANC ) parties , Welensky hit out at what he saw as the poor Colonial Office practice of making the situation " [ consist ] of two opposed policies , black rule and white rule . They naturally prefer to aim for black rule and hope they will experience this , which they regard as the apotheosis of Colonial Office policy " . 
 The Nyasaland African Congress ( NAC ) was particularly vocal about increased African representation in the Nyasaland Legislative Council , demanding in September 1957 an African majority in the council . Nyasaland 's inclusion in the federation was never a goal of its proponents , it was there primarily because it was not economically viable by itself . Welensky did not understand or appreciate the party 's goal of increased African representation or secession when it relied on the federation for its well being . 
 Hastings Banda , the leader of the Nyasaland nationalist cause , returned to the territory in 1958 and began organising opposition to the federation . Having lived outside the territory for more than 25 years and having great difficulty remembering his native African language , he required the assistance of interpreters to communicate with the population , whom he stirred into a frenzy with his speeches . After the Governor and the federal government refused to give Africans a majority in the Legislative Council , he embarked on a speaking tour of the territory . In January 1959 , he stated in a speech that he " put Salisbury [ the capital ] on fire ... I got Salisbury rocking , rocking , and got it awake out of its political sleep ... " , after which his followers stoned passing cars and police officers . 
 The federal government met with the territorial governments to plan for a response should the violence get out of hand . Welensky did not rule out deploying federal troops if the situation deteriorated . Speaking to the defence chiefs in Salisbury , he said that " during the next three months we can expect some fairly serious trouble in Nyasaland ... It is my concern to ensure that this government is in a position to exercise its responsibilities if trouble comes " . 
 A NAC meeting was held outside Blantyre on 25 January . It was alleged that the meeting discussed in detail a plan for the overthrow of the territorial government and the massacre of the territory 's whites and any blacks who collaborated with them . ( although a subsequent Royal Commission found there was insufficient evidence to make such a claim ) . Welensky obtained the meeting 's proceedings in early February and decided to act , calling a meeting of the federal and territorial governments . Federal troops were deployed to Nyasaland on 21 February , the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency on 3 March and the nationalist leaders were arrested and flown to jails in Southern Rhodesia . In the subsequent fortnight , riots broke out and troops used force to end the violence . Almost 50 people died in the unrest . 
 The main militant African nationalist parties in each territory were banned by the federal and territorial governments , but all reorganised under new names only months later . The Southern Rhodesian ANC became the National Democratic Party ( later ZAPU ) , the Northern Rhodesian ANC became the Zambian African National Congress , and the Nyasaland ANC became the Malawi Congress Party . The media 's use of the term ' police state ' to describe the response to the violence outraged the Liberals , the Church of Scotland , and leftist Conservatives , and particularly the Labour Party , in Britain . John Stonehouse , a Labour MP , had been deported prior to the declaration of the state of emergency , adding to the tension . A Royal Commission was announced to investigate the violence . Welensky was indignant when asked to contribute to the Royal Commission , and the Labour Party boycotted it . 
 = = = Commissions and Macmillan = = = 
 In addition to the Royal Commission that investigated the Nyasaland violence ( now known as the Devlin Report ) , the British Government organised a second one , known as the Monckton Report , to advise on the future of the federation . Released in October 1960 , the report advocated sweeping changes to be made to the federal structure , including African majorities in the Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesian legislatures . Welensky was outraged when the report was published , calling it the " death knell of federation " and rejecting it out of hand . African nationalist opinion was just as opposed , but on different grounds . All nationalists wanted an end to federation , and independence for the territories as black @-@ majority @-@ ruled states . Welensky was opposed to any talk of secession , and the Monckton Report suggested it in writing when it stated that the territories should have the option after five years under a new federal constitution . 
 Early 1960 saw British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan journey to the federation for the first and last time . There he held talks in person with Welensky and the territorial governments , and took the opportunity to gauge African opinion towards the federation . He also wished to talk to the jailed African leaders , but was met with a rebuff from Welensky . Hastings Banda discussed the probability of his release from prison with the British Government through Labour MP Dingle Foot . Welensky had Banda 's cell wired for sound and was frustrated with what he saw as the British government 's " betrayal , duplicity , appeasement , cowardice and loss of nerve " when dealing with the African nationalists and the federation . Macmillan travelled on to South Africa , where he made his ' Wind of Change ' speech to the South African Parliament , raising the attention of South African Prime Minister , Dr Hendrik Verwoerd . Welensky was informed that Banda would be released so he could join in discussions with the British Government over the future of the federation . Losing patience with the British , Welensky took a harder line against them : " I 've tried all along to behave in a reasonable and responsible manner . Now I 'm seriously wondering whether restraint has been the right policy . " 
 = = = New constitutions = = = 
 After Banda was released from prison against the wishes of Welensky , he travelled to the United Kingdom , where he took part in the Nyasaland constitutional talks . The outcome was a constitution which , through a voting system that was as complex as that of the federation itself , amounted to black majority rule for the territory . Bitter and angry at what he saw as British ignorance to the situation , Welensky did not comprehend how the British were willing to deal with Banda . In Welensky 's words , since his release from prison , " [ Banda ] was careful to appeal for calm and to condemn violence " , but Welensky was averse to Banda 's demands for black majority rule and believed that granting it to the territory would mean the end of the federation . 
 In Northern and Southern Rhodesia new constitutions were also enacted . The Southern Rhodesian constitution was very cautious and prolonged white rule . It had 50 A @-@ roll seats with high voting qualifications ( essentially for whites ) , and 15 B @-@ roll seats with lower qualifications ( for blacks ) . A system of ' cross voting ' meant that results in A @-@ roll seats would be affected by the B @-@ roll vote , and vice versa . All constitutions were signed by the UFP and the African nationalist party in each territory . However , there were immediate repercussions ; Ian Smith , chief whip for the UFP in the federal assembly , resigned in protest at the new Southern Rhodesian constitution , calling it " racialist " , while the nationalist National Democratic Party withdrew support for the constitution having earlier signed it . 
 Eventually , Welensky was comfortable with an African majority in Nyasaland and for the province to secede , seeking to preserve only a union of the two Rhodesias . But , as a Northern Rhodesian , he did not accept black majority rule for the territory and a battle was had with the British Government over its new constitution throughout 1961 – 62 . Discussing Northern Rhodesia under African rule with Smith : " I am not prepared to hand power to the blacks . Personally I could not live in a country where they were in control . " 
 Welensky considered a federal unilateral declaration of independence when the new Northern Rhodesian constitution appeared likely to grant an African majority in its parliament . Determined at one point to prevent changes , Welensky was convinced that if he refused , the British would use military force to remove his government . Believing that preparations were being made for an invasion from Kenya , he discussed the federation 's ability to repel an attack with his defence chiefs and plans were set in motion . In the end , the idea of a British invasion was one of many options considered , and did not make it past cabinet discussion . 
 = = = Congo , Katanga and Tshombe = = = 
 After Congo @-@ Léopoldville gained independence in 1960 , it collapsed into a state of anarchy within a fortnight . The large Belgian population of the Congo fled from the violence into neighbouring states , including the federation . Welensky dispatched the Royal Rhodesian Air Force ( RRAF ) to assist in their evacuation , but was prevented by the British government from entering the Congo itself . Refugees fled by foot to Ndola in Northern Rhodesia , where RRAF planes picked them up and flew them to camps in Salisbury . More than 6 @,@ 000 people were evacuated by the RRAF . 
 The president of Congo 's Katanga Province , Moise Tshombe , requested British and Rhodesian forces to enter the country to restore order . Welensky was sympathetic to the situation but unable to act ; the British government , which had ultimate jurisdiction over the federation , disallowed him from mobilising the armed forces . Tshombe declared Katanga unilaterally independent on 11 July , one day after requesting British and Rhodesian assistance . Welensky pleaded with Macmillan to deploy the Rhodesian forces but Macmillan rebuffed him , telling Welensky their hopes were pinned on the United Nations being able to restore order , and hoping for a wholly neutral or anti @-@ communist Congo . United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld , hoping to negotiate a solution to Katanga 's secession , agreed to meet Tshombe at Ndola . However , Hammarskjöld 's plane crashed close to Ndola , and he was killed . Welensky was subsequently blamed for the accident throughout the communist and Afro @-@ Asian world , becoming a hated figure and a lingering symbol of colonialism . Welensky 's attitude towards Katanga and the Congo would strain relations between the federation and the British until its dissolution .

 With new constitutions in place for the territories , elections were held throughout 1961 – 62 , with Welensky 's UFP being beaten in each one . In Nyasaland , the African nationalist Malawi Congress Party won a huge majority and Banda set about lobbying the British Government for the break @-@ up of the federation and the independence of Nyasaland as Malawi . In Northern Rhodesia , neither the UFP nor the two African nationalist parties held a majority , but the African nationalists united to push for independence . Welensky hoped to get a display of confidence in federation , so he dissolved parliament in mid @-@ 1962 and held elections . While his party won a huge victory , it did so because it was completely unopposed . Neither the recently formed Rhodesian Front ( RF ) nor the African nationalist parties bothered to contest it . 
 In Southern Rhodesia , the UFP lost the hold that it and its successor parties had for decades in the October election . Ian Smith , a former federal member of the UFP , had united with Winston Field of the Dominion Party to form the Rhodesian Front , a conservative party that was opposed to a fast rate of African political advancement and the 1961 constitution , and in support of Southern Rhodesian independence . The RF won 55 % of the vote and 35 A @-@ roll seats , while the UFP won 44 % of the vote , 15 A @-@ roll seats and 14 B @-@ roll seats . Welensky now had parties in power in all three territorial legislatures that were opposed to the federation and advocating independence for their respective territories .

 With Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia now promised independence by Britain under ' one man , one vote ' constitutions , the federation was essentially dead . Southern Rhodesia , still governed by its white minority , was subject to attacks in the United Nations general assembly which regarded its constitution as unsatisfactory . It demanded ' one man , one vote ' elections , stating that this was the only " realistic answer to the powerful and irresistible urge of the indigenous people for freedom and equality " . 
 Accepting the end of the federation , Welensky set about ensuring that the assets of the federal government were transferred to Southern Rhodesia , making this a condition of him attending dissolution talks at Victoria Falls . Welensky refused to dine with the British delegates , on the grounds of " not choking on his food " , but ensured that the talks went smoothly . The federation was legally dissolved on 31 December 1963 .

 With the collapse of the federation , Welensky moved to Salisbury , Rhodesia ( renamed from Southern Rhodesia after Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia ) . After a short break , he was invited to lead the UFP in Rhodesia , which had recently renamed itself the Rhodesia Party . With the Rhodesian Front pushing for independence for the territory and a new constitution , the Rhodesia Party advocated the same , but with a focus on stemming white emigration and rebuilding the economy ( all three territories had slipped into recession with the end of the federation ) . 
 With the resignation of the RF member for the Salisbury constituency of Arundel , Welensky was given a chance to re @-@ enter the political arena . Clifford Dupont , Deputy Prime Minister , resigned his constituency in Charter to oppose Welensky . Welensky knew if the RF won the <unk> it would appear as a mandate for unilateral independence ; the campaign , for only two seats , was intense . At public meetings , Welensky was heckled by opponents to ironic cries of ' Communist ' , ' traitor ' , and ' coward ' . Sharing a television platform with Smith on 3 September , Welensky talked of the economic and political dangers of a UDI , but nonetheless wished Smith luck when he departed for independence talks in London . Welensky had much more antipathy for the British Government than his RF opponents , and was disgusted at their treatment of the Rhodesians during constitutional talks : 
 I want to remind you that I am no friend of the present Government in Rhodesia : I have opposed their policies and can be considered a political opponent . But I was as horrified as any other Rhodesian at this cavalier treatment of a country which has , since its creation , staunchly supported , in every possible way , Britain and the Commonwealth . 
 On 1 October Welensky was soundly defeated by his RF opponent , with 633 votes to Dupont 's 1079 . In December he resigned the leadership of his party . When the RF declared unilateral independence on 11 November 1965 , Welensky was upset at the constitutional break with Britain . He believed that Rhodesia was entitled to her independence , and disagreed with the British government 's demand for ' no independence before majority rule ' , but was opposed to illegal action . 
 Welensky continued living in Rhodesia until Robert Mugabe gained power and the country became Zimbabwe in 1980 . While in London in 1971 , and by then a widower , Welensky met his second wife , Valerie Scott , an organiser for the Cities of London and Westminster Conservative Association , who was some thirty years his junior . The couple relocated in 1981 to Blandford Forum , Dorset , where he died on 5 December 1991 . 
 = Meningitis = 
 Meningitis is an acute inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord , known collectively as the meninges . The most common symptoms are fever , headache and neck stiffness . Other symptoms include confusion or altered consciousness , vomiting , and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises . Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms , such as irritability , drowsiness , or poor feeding . If a rash is present , it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis ; for instance , meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may be accompanied by a characteristic rash . 
 The inflammation may be caused by infection with viruses , bacteria , or other microorganisms , and less commonly by certain drugs . Meningitis can be life @-@ threatening because of the inflammation 's proximity to the brain and spinal cord ; therefore , the condition is classified as a medical emergency . A lumbar puncture diagnoses or excludes meningitis . A needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , that envelops the brain and spinal cord . The CSF is examined in a medical laboratory .
