 = German submarine U @-@ 43 ( 1939 ) = 
 German submarine U @-@ 43 was a Type IXA U @-@ boat of Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine during World War II . The keel for U @-@ 43 was laid down in August 1938 at Bremen ; she was launched in May 1939 and commissioned in August . 
 Between November 1939 and July 1943 , the U @-@ boat conducted 14 combat patrols , sinking 21 merchant ships for a total of 117 @,@ 036 gross register tons ( GRT ) , damaging one ship of 10 @,@ 350 GRT and another of 9 @,@ 131 GRT - enough for it to be declared a total loss . 
 U @-@ 43 was sunk on 30 July 1943 southwest of the Azores by a torpedo dropped by a United States Navy aircraft ; all 55 hands were lost .

 U @-@ 43 was ordered for the Kriegsmarine on 21 November 1936 ( as part of Plan Z and in violation of the Treaty of Versailles ) . Her keel was laid down on 15 August 1938 by AG Weser , Bremen as yard number 946 . She was launched on 23 May 1939 and commissioned on 26 August of that same year under the command of Korvettenkapitän Wilhelm Ambrosius .

 As one of the eight original German Type IX submarines , later designated IXA , U @-@ 43 had a displacement of 1 @,@ 032 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 016 long tons ) when at the surface and 1 @,@ 153 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 135 long tons ) while submerged . The U @-@ boat had a total length of 76 @.@ 50 m ( 251 ft ) , a pressure hull length of 58 @.@ 75 m ( 192 ft 9 in ) , a beam of 6 @.@ 51 m ( 21 ft 4 in ) , a height of 9 @.@ 40 m ( 30 ft 10 in ) , and a draught of 4 @.@ 70 m ( 15 ft 5 in ) . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40 / 46 supercharged four @-@ stroke , nine @-@ cylinder diesel engines producing a total of 4 @,@ 400 metric horsepower ( 3 @,@ 240 kW ; 4 @,@ 340 shp ) for use while surfaced , two Siemens @-@ Schuckert 2 GU 345 / 34 double @-@ acting electric motors producing a total of 1 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 740 kW ; 990 shp ) for use while submerged . She had two shafts and two 1 @.@ 92 m ( 6 ft ) propellers . The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres ( 750 ft ) . 
 The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 18 @.@ 2 knots ( 33 @.@ 7 km / h ; 20 @.@ 9 mph ) and a maximum submerged speed of 7 @.@ 7 knots ( 14 @.@ 3 km / h ; 8 @.@ 9 mph ) .

 Commissioned into the 6th U @-@ boat Flotilla , based at Kiel , U @-@ 43 left for her first combat patrol of the war on 6 November 1939 , sailing around the British Isles and into the Atlantic . There , on 16 November , she attacked the 4 @,@ 915 ton British merchant ship Arlington Court , a straggler from Convoy SL @-@ 7A , en route from Rosario , Argentina to Hull with a cargo of 7 @,@ 340 tons of maize . The ship was hit by a single torpedo 320 nautical miles ( 590 km ; 370 mi ) west @-@ south @-@ west of Start Point in Devon . The crew abandoned ship , the U @-@ boat fired another torpedo , which sank the ship within 30 minutes . Seven of the crew were lost , the survivors were picked up by Dutch and Norwegian freighters . After the attack , U @-@ 43 was hunted by convoy escorts for 20 hours , sustaining some damage from depth charges . 
 Continuing with her patrol , U @-@ 43 attacked Convoy 14 @-@ BS in the Bay of Biscay , and sank the 4 @,@ 374 ton French merchant ship <unk> on 22 November . Convoy escorts counter @-@ attacked with 23 depth charges , but U @-@ 43 escaped without damage . 
 Late on 25 November 1939 , about 120 nautical miles ( 220 km ; 140 mi ) west @-@ north @-@ west of Cape Finisterre ( northwest Spain ) , U @-@ 43 attacked the unescorted 2 @,@ 483 ton British collier Uskmouth . Both G7a torpedoes malfunctioned ( a common problem in the early years of the war ) , so the U @-@ boat opened fire with her deck gun . After a while she fired another torpedo , but missed , so recommenced shelling . After firing 149 rounds , U @-@ 43 left the ship on fire and slowly sinking . Two crewmen were killed , while 23 survivors were picked up by an Italian merchant ship . 
 On the morning of 8 December U @-@ 43 was attacked by an unidentified aircraft and severely damaged . She returned to Wilhelmshaven six days later , on the 14th . 
 = = = 2nd patrol = = = 
 After the 6th U @-@ boat Flotilla was disbanded in December 1939 , U @-@ 43 was assigned to the 2nd U @-@ boat Flotilla based in Wilhelmshaven . U @-@ 43 departed from there on 13 March 1940 and sailed along the coast of Norway , north of Scotland , and into the waters west of Ireland , but had no success . The First Watch Officer ( second @-@ in @-@ command of the U @-@ boat ) Oberleutnant zur See Hans @-@ Wilhelm Behrens fell overboard and was lost on 31 March . U @-@ 43 returned to Wilhelmshaven , after 25 days at sea , on 6 April . 
 = = = 3rd patrol = = = 
 U @-@ 43 's third voyage began on 12 April 1940 . She patrolled the North Sea and along the Norwegian coast , supporting the invasion of that country . On 22 April she was bombed by two British Hudson aircraft and suffered slight damage . She returned to Wilhelmshaven the next day . 
 = = = 4th patrol = = = 
 U @-@ 43 sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 13 May 1940 and out into the Atlantic . Her first attack took place on 28 May , south @-@ west of Land 's End , when she fired a torpedo at the British merchant ship Alca . She missed , and then opened fire with her deck gun . The armed ship returned fire , but neither vessel made any hits ; the U @-@ boat broke off the attack . 
 U @-@ 43 finally found success on 21 June when she attacked Convoy 65 @-@ X south @-@ west of Figueira da Foz , Portugal , hitting the 8 @,@ 627 ton British tanker <unk> with a single torpedo . The ship caught fire and sank . Five crew members were killed , the 45 survivors were picked up by a French trawler . 
 Late on 30 June U @-@ 43 hit the 13 @,@ 376 ton British merchant ship SS <unk> Star with a single torpedo 220 nautical miles ( 410 km ; 250 mi ) northwest of Cape Finisterre . The ship , part of Convoy SL @-@ 36 , was en route from Buenos Aires to London with a cargo of 5 @,@ 630 tons of frozen meat and 1 @,@ 000 tons of oranges . The crew abandoned the ship , which foundered the next day . One crewman was killed in the attack , the 84 survivors were picked up by the British merchant ship <unk> , which was subsequently torpedoed and sunk by U @-@ 30 on 1 July . Three survivors from <unk> Star were killed . 
 On the evening of 9 July U @-@ 43 sank the unescorted 3 @,@ 944 ton British merchant ship Aylesbury about 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ; 230 mi ) southeast of Ireland . Hit by two torpedoes , the ship sank in 15 minutes . All 35 crew survived . 
 U @-@ 43 's fourth and final success on her fourth patrol took place on the morning of 17 July when she sank the 3 @,@ 509 @-@ ton British merchant ship <unk> , a straggler from convoy OA @-@ 184 , about 135 nautical miles ( 250 km ; 155 mi ) north @-@ west of Bloody Foreland ( Cnoc <unk> ) , Donegal . The U @-@ boat 's first torpedo passed under the vessel , but the second struck the ship and caused her to sink within five minutes . Twelve of the crew were killed , 21 survivors were rescued . U @-@ 43 arrived back at Wilhelmshaven on 22 July after 71 days at sea . 
 = = = 5th patrol = = = 
 U @-@ 43 sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 9 September 1940 , stopping at Bergen , Norway for three days before sailing on the 15th for another Atlantic patrol . She sank only one ship , the 5 @,@ 802 ton British merchantman <unk> , separated from Convoy OB @-@ 217 , on 25 September . The U @-@ boat hit the ship with a single torpedo causing her to sink 356 nautical miles ( 659 km ; 410 mi ) west of Achill Head , County Mayo . One man was lost , the remaining 56 crewmen were picked up by HMCS Ottawa . 
 U @-@ 43 then made for her new home port at Lorient in France , where the 2nd U @-@ boat Flotilla had relocated in June after the fall of that country , arriving there on 18 October . Her commander , Wilhelm Ambrosius , was promoted to Korvettenkapitän on 1 November , and left U @-@ 43 , going on to take command of the 22nd U @-@ boat Flotilla in January 1941 . Command of the U @-@ boat passed to Oberleutnant zur See Wolfgang Lüth , who would go on to become the second most successful German submarine commander of the war . 
 = = = 6th patrol = = = 
 Under her new captain , U @-@ 43 left Lorient on 10 November 1940 and returned to the waters west of Ireland , where she sank three more merchant ships and damaged a fourth . 
 On the morning of 2 December she attacked Convoy OB @-@ 251 west @-@ south @-@ west of Rockall and sank two ships . Her first victim was the 7 @,@ 113 ton British merchant ship Pacific President , which was hit by two torpedoes and quickly sank with the loss of her crew of 50 men . Forty @-@ five minutes later U @-@ 43 hit the 12 @,@ 247 ton British oil tanker Victor Ross with two torpedoes . A third torpedo was fired five minutes later , but missed , the U @-@ boat evaded a ramming attempt by crash @-@ diving shortly afterwards . However , she persisted and hit the ship with a fourth torpedo 20 minutes later , sinking her . There were no survivors from her 44 crew . 
 In the evening of 6 December , U @-@ 43 spotted a ship and pursued her for three and a half hours before firing a single torpedo , which missed . The U @-@ boat fired another torpedo 20 minutes later , hitting the unknown ship and sinking her in 63 seconds . The vessel is believed to be the 1 @,@ 902 ton Norwegian merchant ship <unk> , which had lost contact with Convoy OB @-@ 252 two days before in heavy weather and was never seen again . 
 Finally , on 13 December , U @-@ 43 fired two torpedoes at the unescorted 10 @,@ 350 ton British merchant ship Orari about 450 nautical miles ( 830 km ; 520 mi ) southwest of Ireland . One torpedo hit the ship in the stern . However , U @-@ 43 had no torpedoes left , and the sea was too rough for her to use her deck gun . The crew of the ship managed to plug the hole with tarpaulins , and the ship made it under her own power to the Clyde . 
 U @-@ 43 returned to Lorient on 17 December 1940 after a patrol of 38 days . On 4 February 1941 , while at Lorient docks , U @-@ 43 was sunk after a valve was accidentally left open , putting the U @-@ boat out of action for the next three months . 
 = = = 7th patrol = = = 
 After this enforced absence U @-@ 43 began her next patrol on 11 May 1941 , still under the command of Wolfgang Lüth , who had been promoted to Kapitänleutnant on 1 January . Once again she sailed out into the mid @-@ Atlantic , where she sank three ships . 
 Early on the morning of 15 May U @-@ 43 opened fire with her deck gun and anti @-@ aircraft guns on the 488 ton French three @-@ masted sailing ship Notre Dame du Châtelet , en route from St. Malo to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to fish . After being hit by 45 shells the ship sank . Lüth suspected that the vessel was reporting the positions of U @-@ boats to Allied forces , while the 10 survivors thought they had been attacked by a British submarine . They , from her crew of 38 , abandoned ship in two lifeboats . Two were picked up by the Italian submarine <unk> on 23 May . 
 On the evening of 6 June U @-@ 43 put two torpedoes into the 4 @,@ 802 ton Dutch merchant ship <unk> about 600 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 100 km ; 690 mi ) east of Newfoundland . The ship , separated from Convoy OB @-@ 328 , sank within two minutes . Only 10 of her crew of 34 survived to be rescued by the Finnish merchantman <unk> on 15 June . 
 In the early hours of 17 June , U @-@ 43 torpedoed and sank the 2 @,@ 727 ton British merchant ship Cathrine , part of Convoy SL @-@ 76 , which was loaded with 3 @,@ 700 tons of manganese ore , about 250 nautical miles ( 460 km ; 290 mi ) south @-@ west of Cape Clear ( southern Ireland ) . Only three men survived from her crew of 27 ; they spent 33 days in a lifeboat before being found by a British trawler . 
 U @-@ 43 returned to Lorient on 1 July after a patrol lasting 52 days . 
 = = = 8th and 9th patrols = = = 
 U @-@ 43 's next patrol , beginning on 2 August 1941 , took her back out into the mid @-@ Atlantic for 53 days , but she had no success before returning to Lorient on 23 September . 
 U @-@ 43 went to sea again on 10 November 1941 , this time she was more successful , sinking three ships near the Azores . 
 Early on the morning of 29 November , U @-@ 43 fired two torpedoes at the 5 @,@ 569 ton British merchant ship Thornliebank , part of Convoy OS @-@ 12 , and loaded with general cargo and munitions , about 240 nautical miles ( 440 km ; 280 mi ) north @-@ north @-@ west of the Azores . Both torpedoes struck the ship , which exploded violently . There were no survivors from the crew of 75 men . Despite being about 1 @,@ 200 metres ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) distant , debris from the explosion struck the surfaced U @-@ boat , slightly injuring a crewman ; the next day an <unk> 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) shell was found lodged in the conning tower . 
 On the evening of 30 November , the 4 @,@ 868 @-@ ton British merchant ship Ashby , a straggler from Convoy OS @-@ 12 , was hit by one of two torpedoes fired by U @-@ 43 , 170 nautical miles ( 310 km ; 200 mi ) south @-@ south @-@ east of Flores in the Azores . The ship sank within four minutes with the loss of 17 of her crew of 50 . The survivors were picked up by the Portuguese destroyer Lima . After the attack the U @-@ boat was depth charged for several hours by convoy escorts , but managed to escape unharmed . 
 At about 17 : 00 on 1 December 1941 , U @-@ 43 and U @-@ 575 spotted the 7 @,@ 542 ton unescorted and unarmed tanker Astral . Both U @-@ boats gave chase , but after four hours U @-@ 575 , commanded by Kapitänleutnant Günther <unk> , observed the large American flag painted on her side and abandoned the pursuit . U @-@ 43 continued to follow the neutral ship , firing a torpedo at her around midnight , which missed . The ship immediately began to sail a zigzag evasive course at full speed , but the U @-@ boat had no problem following her in the light of the full moon . The next morning U @-@ 43 hit the Astral with two torpedoes . The ship , loaded with 78 @,@ 200 barrels ( 12 @,@ 430 m3 ) of gasoline and kerosene , exploded and sank within minutes . There were no survivors from her crew of 37 . The Astral was the third of four American merchant ships sunk by U @-@ boats prior to America 's entry into the war . 
 U @-@ 43 returned to Lorient on 16 December .

On the morning of 12 January 1942 the ship was hit by two torpedoes and sank within a minute . Six British passengers and 32 crewmen were lost , the only two survivors were spotted on a raft on 10 February by a British patrol aircraft , which directed a fishing trawler to their position the next day . 
 Early in the morning of 14 January , U @-@ 43 attacked Convoy ON @-@ 55 south of Iceland and sank the 6 @,@ 641 ton British merchant ship Empire Surf . Only six of the crew of 53 survived to be picked up by HMS <unk> .

A 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) diameter hole was made in her side , and the cargo caught fire . While some of the crew abandoned ship , those remaining aboard managed to put the fires out ; making only three knots , the ship limped the 300 nautical miles ( 560 km ; 350 mi ) to Bonavista Bay , Newfoundland , arriving on 24 November . Brilliant eventually left Newfoundland on 18 January 1943 under tow , but after two days the ship broke in half . The fore section sank immediately , while the aft section drifted for some days before it was found and the 44 crew rescued . The aft section was taken in tow , but sank the next day .

 = Coeliac disease = 
 Coeliac disease , also spelled celiac disease , is an autoimmune disorder affecting primarily the small intestine that occurs in people who are genetically predisposed . Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea , abdominal distention , malabsorption , loss of appetite , and among children failure to grow normally . This often begins between six months and two years of age . Non @-@ classic symptoms are the most common , especially in people older than two years . There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms , a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body , or no obvious symptoms . Coeliac disease was first described in childhood ; however , it may develop at any age . It is associated with other autoimmune diseases , such as diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroiditis , among others . 
 Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gluten , which are various proteins found in wheat and in other grains such as barley , and rye . Moderate quantities of oats , free of contamination with other gluten @-@ containing grains , are usually tolerated but problems may depend on the type consumed . Upon exposure to gluten , an abnormal immune response may lead to the production of several different autoantibodies that can affect a number of different organs . In the small @-@ bowel this causes an inflammatory reaction and may produce shortening of the villi lining the small intestine ( villous atrophy ) . This affects the absorption of nutrients , frequently leading to anaemia . 
 Diagnosis is typically made by a combination of blood antibody tests and intestinal biopsies , helped by specific genetic testing . Making the diagnosis is not always straightforward . Frequently , the autoantibodies in the blood are negative and many people have only minor intestinal changes with normal villi . People may have severe symptoms and be investigated for years before a diagnosis is achieved . Increasingly , the diagnosis is being made in people without symptoms as a result of screening . While the disease is caused by a permanent intolerance to wheat proteins , it is usually classified as different from the other forms of wheat allergy . 
 The only known effective treatment is a strict lifelong gluten @-@ free diet , which leads to recovery of the intestinal mucosa , improves symptoms , and reduced risk of developing complications in most people . If untreated it may result in cancers such as intestinal lymphoma and a slight increased risk of early death . Rates vary between different regions of the world , from as few as 1 in 300 to as many as 1 in 40 , with an average of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 170 people . In developed countries , it is estimated that five out of six cases ( 83 % ) remain undiagnosed , usually because of non @-@ classic , minimal , or absent complaints . Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men . The term " coeliac " is from the Greek <unk> ( <unk> , " abdominal " ) and was introduced in the 19th century in a translation of what is generally regarded as an ancient Greek description of the disease by Aretaeus of Cappadocia . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 The classic symptoms of coeliac disease include pale , loose , and greasy stool ( <unk> ) and weight loss or failure to gain weight ( in young children ) . More commonly symptoms are subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself . It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any symptoms whatsoever . This represents at least in 43 % of the cases in children . Many adults with subtle disease only have fatigue or anaemia . 
 = = = Gastrointestinal = = = 
 The diarrhea that is characteristic of coeliac disease is ( chronic ) pale , voluminous , and abnormally malodorous . Abdominal pain and cramping , <unk> with abdominal distension ( thought to be due to <unk> production of bowel gas ) , and mouth ulcers may be present . As the bowel becomes more damaged , a degree of lactose intolerance may develop . Frequently , the symptoms are ascribed to irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , only later to be recognised as coeliac disease ; a small proportion of people with symptoms of IBS have underlying coeliac disease , and screening for coeliac disease is recommended for those with IBS symptoms . 
 Coeliac disease leads to an increased risk of both adenocarcinoma and lymphoma of the small bowel ( enteropathy @-@ associated T @-@ cell lymphoma ( <unk> ) or other non @-@ Hodgkin 's lymphomas ) . This risk is also higher in first @-@ degree relatives such as siblings , parents , and children . Whether or not a gluten @-@ free diet brings this risk back to baseline is not clear . Long @-@ standing and untreated disease may lead to other complications , such as ulcerative <unk> ( ulcer formation of the small bowel ) and stricturing ( narrowing as a result of scarring with obstruction of the bowel ) . 
 = = = <unk> @-@ related = = = 
 The changes in the bowel make it less able to absorb nutrients , minerals , and the fat @-@ soluble vitamins A , D , E , and K. 
 The inability to absorb carbohydrates and fats may cause weight loss ( or failure to thrive / stunted growth in children ) and fatigue or lack of energy . 
 <unk> may develop in several ways : iron malabsorption may cause iron deficiency anaemia , and folic acid and vitamin B12 malabsorption may give rise to megaloblastic anaemia . 
 Calcium and vitamin D malabsorption ( and compensatory secondary hyperparathyroidism ) may cause osteopenia ( decreased mineral content of the bone ) or osteoporosis ( bone weakening and risk of fragility fractures ) . 
 Selenium malabsorption in coeliac disease , combined with low selenium content in many gluten @-@ free foods , confers a risk of selenium deficiency , 
 Copper and zinc deficiencies have also been associated with coeliac disease . 
 A small proportion have abnormal coagulation due to vitamin K deficiency and are slightly at risk for abnormal bleeding . 
 = = = Miscellaneous = = = 
 Coeliac disease has been linked with a number of conditions . In many cases , it is unclear whether the gluten @-@ induced bowel disease is a causative factor or whether these conditions share a common predisposition . 
 IgA deficiency is present in 2 @.@ 3 % of people with coeliac disease , and in turn this condition features a tenfold increased risk of coeliac disease . Other features of this condition are an increased risk of infections and autoimmune disease . 
 <unk> herpetiformis , an itchy cutaneous condition , has been linked to a transglutaminase enzyme in the skin , features small @-@ bowel changes identical to those in coeliac disease , and may respond to gluten withdrawal even if no gastrointestinal symptoms are present . 
 Growth failure and / or pubertal delay in later childhood can occur even without obvious bowel symptoms or severe malnutrition . Evaluation of growth failure often includes coeliac screening . 
 Pregnancy complications can occur in case of coeliac disease as an intercurrent disease in pregnancy , with significant complications including miscarriage , intrauterine growth restriction , low <unk> and preterm birth . 
 <unk> ( a small and underactive spleen ) occurs in about a third of cases and may predispose to infection given the role of the spleen in protecting against bacteria . 
 Abnormal liver function tests ( randomly detected on blood tests ) may be seen . 
 Coeliac disease is associated with a number of other medical conditions , many of which are autoimmune disorders : diabetes mellitus type 1 , hypothyroidism , primary biliary cirrhosis , microscopic colitis , gluten ataxia , psoriasis , vitiligo , autoimmune hepatitis , dermatitis herpetiformis , primary sclerosing cholangitis , and more . 
 A more controversial area is a group of diseases in which <unk> antibodies ( an older and nonspecific test for coeliac disease ) are sometimes detected but no small bowel disease can be demonstrated . Sometimes these conditions improve by removing gluten from the diet . This includes cerebellar ataxia , peripheral neuropathy , schizophrenia , and autism . 
 = = Cause = = 
 Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gliadin , a prolamin ( gluten protein ) found in wheat , and similar proteins found in the crops of the tribe <unk> ( which includes other common grains such as barley and rye ) . 
 = = = Other grains = = = 
 Wheat subspecies ( such as spelt , durum and Kamut ) and related species ( such as barley , rye and triticale ) also induce symptoms of coeliac disease . A small number of people with coeliac also react to oats . It is most probable that oats produce symptoms due to cross @-@ contamination with other grains in the fields or in the distribution channels . Therefore , oats are generally not recommended . However , many companies assure the ' purity ' of oats , and they are therefore still able to be consumed through these sources . 
 Other cereals such as corn , millet , sorghum , <unk> , rice , and wild rice are safe for people with coeliac to consume , as well as <unk> such as amaranth , <unk> , and buckwheat . <unk> carbohydrate @-@ rich foods such as potatoes and bananas do not contain gluten and do not trigger symptoms . 
 = = = Risk modifiers = = = 
 There are various theories as to what determines whether a genetically susceptible individual will go on to develop coeliac disease . Major theories include infection by rotavirus or human intestinal adenovirus . Some research has suggested that smoking is protective against adult @-@ onset coeliac disease . 
 The eating of gluten early in a baby 's life does not appear to increase the risk of CD but later introduction after 6 months may increase it . There is uncertainty whether breastfeeding reduces risk . Prolonging breastfeeding until the introduction of gluten @-@ containing grains into the diet appears to be associated with a 50 % reduced risk of developing coeliac disease in infancy ; whether this persists into adulthood is not clear . These factors may just influence the timing of onset . Factors that can trigger symptoms include : surgery , pregnancy , infection and emotional stress . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Coeliac disease appears to be multifactorial , both in that more than one genetic factor can cause the disease and in that more than one factor is necessary for the disease to manifest in a person . 
 Almost all people ( 95 % ) with coeliac disease have either the variant HLA @-@ DQ2 allele or ( less commonly ) the HLA @-@ DQ8 allele . However , about 20 – 30 % of people without coeliac disease have also inherited either of these alleles . This suggests additional factors are needed for coeliac disease to develop ; that is , the predisposing HLA risk allele is necessary but not sufficient to develop coeliac disease . Furthermore , around 5 % of those people who do develop coeliac disease do not have typical HLA @-@ DQ2 or HLA @-@ DQ8 alleles ( see below ) . 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 The vast majority of people with coeliac have one of two types of the HLA @-@ DQ protein . HLA @-@ DQ is part of the MHC class II antigen @-@ presenting receptor ( also called the human leukocyte antigen ) system and distinguishes cells between self and non @-@ self for the purposes of the immune system . The two subunits of the HLA @-@ DQ protein are encoded by the HLA @-@ DQA1 and HLA @-@ DQB1 genes , located on the short arm of the sixth chromosome . 
 There are seven HLA @-@ DQ variants ( DQ2 and <unk> – <unk> ) . Over 95 % of people with coeliac have the isoform of DQ2 or DQ8 , which is inherited in families . The reason these genes produce an increase in risk of coeliac disease is that the receptors formed by these genes bind to gliadin peptides more tightly than other forms of the antigen @-@ presenting receptor . Therefore , these forms of the receptor are more likely to activate T lymphocytes and initiate the autoimmune process . 
 Most people with coeliac bear a two @-@ gene HLA @-@ DQ2 haplotype referred to as DQ2.5 haplotype . This haplotype is composed of two adjacent gene alleles , DQA1 * <unk> and DQB1 * <unk> , which encode the two subunits , DQ <unk> and DQ β2 . In most individuals , this DQ2.5 isoform is encoded by one of two chromosomes 6 inherited from parents ( <unk> ) . Most coeliacs inherit only one copy of this DQ2.5 haplotype , while some inherit it from both parents ; the latter are especially at risk for coeliac disease as well as being more susceptible to severe complications . 
 Some individuals inherit DQ2.5 from one parent and an additional portion of the haplotype ( either DQB1 * 02 or DQA1 * 05 ) from the other parent , increasing risk . Less commonly , some individuals inherit the DQA1 * 05 allele from one parent and the DQB1 * 02 from the other parent ( <unk> ) ( called a trans @-@ haplotype association ) , and these individuals are at similar risk for coeliac disease as those with a single DQ2.5 @-@ bearing chromosome 6 , but in this instance disease tends not to be familial . Among the 6 % of European coeliacs that do not have DQ2.5 ( cis or trans ) or DQ8 ( encoded by the haplotype DQA1 * 03 : DQB1 * <unk> ) , 4 % have the <unk> isoform , and the remaining 2 % lack DQ2 or DQ8 . 
 The frequency of these genes varies geographically . DQ2.5 has high frequency in peoples of North and Western Europe ( Basque Country and Ireland with highest frequencies ) and portions of Africa and is associated with disease in India , but is not found along portions of the West Pacific rim . DQ8 has a wider global distribution than DQ2.5 and is particularly common in South and Central America ; up to 90 % of individuals in certain Amerindian populations carry DQ8 and thus may display the coeliac phenotype . 
 Other genetic factors have been repeatedly reported in coeliac disease ; however , involvement in disease has variable geographic recognition . Only the HLA @-@ DQ loci show a consistent involvement over the global population . Many of the loci detected have been found in association with other autoimmune diseases . One locus , the LPP or <unk> @-@ preferred partner gene , is involved in the adhesion of extracellular matrix to the cell surface , and a minor variant ( SNP = <unk> ) increases the risk of disease by approximately 30 % . This gene strongly associates with coeliac disease ( p < 10 − 39 ) in samples taken from a broad area of Europe and the US . 
 The prevalence of coeliac disease genotypes in the modern population is not completely understood . Given the characteristics of the disease and its apparent strong heritability , it would normally be expected that the genotypes would undergo negative selection and to be absent in societies where agriculture has been practised the longest ( compare with a similar condition , Lactose intolerance , which has been negatively selected so strongly that its prevalence went from ~ 100 % in ancestral populations to less than 5 % in some European countries ) . This expectation was first proposed by <unk> ( 1981 ) . By now , however , it is apparent that this is not the case ; on the contrary , there is evidence of positive selection in coeliac disease genotypes . It is suspected that some of them may have been beneficial by providing protection against bacterial infections . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The majority of the proteins in food responsible for the immune reaction in coeliac disease are the prolamins . These are storage proteins rich in proline ( <unk> ) and glutamine ( <unk> ) that dissolve in alcohols and are resistant to proteases and peptidases of the gut . <unk> are found in cereal grains with different grains having different but related prolamins : wheat ( gliadin ) , barley ( <unk> ) , rye ( <unk> ) , corn ( <unk> ) and as a minor protein , <unk> in oats . One region of α @-@ gliadin stimulates membrane cells , enterocytes , of the intestine to allow larger molecules around the sealant between cells . Disruption of tight junctions allow peptides larger than three amino acids to enter circulation . 
 Membrane leaking permits peptides of gliadin that stimulate two levels of immune response , the innate response and the adaptive ( T @-@ helper cell mediated ) response . One protease @-@ resistant peptide from α @-@ gliadin contains a region that stimulates lymphocytes and results in the release of interleukin @-@ 15 . This innate response to gliadin results in immune @-@ system signalling that attracts inflammatory cells and increases the release of inflammatory chemicals . The strongest and most common adaptive response to gliadin is directed toward an α2 @-@ gliadin fragment of 33 amino acids in length . 
 The response to the <unk> occurs in most coeliacs who have a DQ2 isoform . This peptide , when altered by intestinal transglutaminase , has a high density of overlapping T @-@ cell epitopes . This increases the likelihood that the DQ2 isoform will bind and stay bound to peptide when recognised by T @-@ cells . <unk> in wheat is the best @-@ understood member of this family , but other prolamins exist , and <unk> ( from barley ) and <unk> ( from rye ) may contribute to coeliac disease . However , not all prolamins will cause this immune reaction , and there is ongoing controversy on the ability of <unk> ( the prolamin found in oats ) to induce this response in coeliac disease . 
 = = = Tissue transglutaminase = = = 
 Anti @-@ transglutaminase antibodies to the enzyme tissue transglutaminase ( tTG ) are found in the blood of the majority of people with classic symptoms and complete villous atrophy , but only in 70 % of the cases with partial villous atrophy and 30 % of the cases with minor mucosal lesions . Tissue transglutaminase modifies gluten peptides into a form that may stimulate the immune system more effectively . These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways , deamidation or transamidation . 
 <unk> is the reaction by which a glutamate residue is formed by cleavage of the epsilon @-@ amino group of a glutamine side chain . <unk> , which occurs three times more often than deamidation , is the cross @-@ linking of a glutamine residue from the gliadin peptide to a lysine residue of tTg in a reaction which is catalysed by the transglutaminase . <unk> may occur either within or outside the active site of the enzyme . The latter case yields a permanently covalently linked complex between the gliadin and the tTg . This results in the formation of new epitopes which are believed to trigger the primary immune response by which the autoantibodies against tTg develop . 
 Stored biopsies from people with suspected coeliac disease have revealed that <unk> deposits in the subclinical coeliacs are detected prior to clinical disease . These deposits are also found in people who present with other autoimmune diseases , anaemia , or malabsorption phenomena at a much increased rate over the normal population . <unk> components of antibodies ( EMA ) to tTG are believed to be directed toward cell @-@ surface transglutaminase , and these antibodies are still used in confirming a coeliac disease diagnosis . However , a 2006 study showed that EMA @-@ negative people with coeliac tend to be older males with more severe abdominal symptoms and a lower frequency of " atypical " symptoms , including autoimmune disease . In this study , the anti @-@ tTG antibody deposits did not correlate with the severity of villous destruction . These findings , coupled with recent work showing that gliadin has an innate response component , suggest that gliadin may be more responsible for the primary manifestations of coeliac disease , whereas tTG is a bigger factor in secondary effects such as allergic responses and secondary autoimmune diseases . In a large percentage of people with coeliac , the anti @-@ tTG antibodies also recognise a rotavirus protein called VP7 . These antibodies stimulate monocyte proliferation , and rotavirus infection might explain some early steps in the cascade of immune cell proliferation . 
 Indeed , earlier studies of rotavirus damage in the gut showed this causes a villous atrophy . This suggests that viral proteins may take part in the initial flattening and stimulate self @-@ <unk> anti @-@ VP7 production . Antibodies to VP7 may also slow healing until the gliadin @-@ mediated tTG presentation provides a second source of <unk> antibodies . 
 Other intestinal disorders may have biopsy that look like coeliac disease including lesions caused by Candida . 
 = = = <unk> atrophy and malabsorption = = = 
 The inflammatory process , mediated by T cells , leads to disruption of the structure and function of the small bowel 's mucosal lining and causes malabsorption as it impairs the body 's ability to absorb nutrients , minerals and fat @-@ soluble vitamins A , D , E and K from food . Lactose intolerance may be present due to the decreased bowel surface and reduced production of lactase but typically resolves once the condition is treated . 
 Alternative causes of this tissue damage have been proposed and involve release of interleukin 15 and activation of the innate immune system by a shorter gluten peptide ( <unk> – 43 / 49 ) . This would trigger killing of enterocytes by lymphocytes in the epithelium . The villous atrophy seen on biopsy may also be due to unrelated causes , such as tropical sprue , <unk> and radiation enteritis . While positive serology and typical biopsy are highly suggestive of coeliac disease , lack of response to diet may require these alternative diagnoses to be considered . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Diagnosis is often very difficult so that most cases are diagnosed with great delay . There are several tests that can be used . The level of symptoms may determine the order of the tests , but all tests lose their usefulness if the person is already eating a gluten @-@ free diet . Intestinal damage begins to heal within weeks of gluten being removed from the diet , and antibody levels decline over months . For those who have already started on a gluten @-@ free diet , it may be necessary to perform a <unk> with some gluten @-@ containing food in one meal a day over 6 weeks before repeating the investigations . 
 = = = Blood tests = = = 
 <unk> blood tests are the first @-@ line investigation required to make a diagnosis of coeliac disease . Its sensitivity correlates with the degree of histological lesions . People who present minor damage of the small intestine may have seronegative findings so many patients with coeliac disease often are missed . In patients with villous atrophy , anti @-@ endomysial ( EMA ) antibodies of the immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) type can detect coeliac disease with a sensitivity and specificity of 90 % and 99 % , respectively . Serology for anti @-@ transglutaminase antibodies ( anti @-@ tTG ) was initially reported to have a higher sensitivity ( 99 % ) and specificity ( > 90 % ) . However , it is now thought to have similar characteristics to anti @-@ endomysial antibody . Both anti @-@ transglutaminase and anti @-@ endomysial antibodies have high sensitivity to diagnose people with classic symptoms and complete villous atrophy , but they are only found in 30 @-@ 89 % of the cases with partial villous atrophy and in less than 50 % of the people who have minor mucosal lesions ( duodenal <unk> ) with normal villi . 
 Tissue transglutaminase modifies gluten peptides into a form that may stimulate the immune system more effectively . These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways , deamidation or transamidation . Modern anti @-@ tTG assays rely on a human recombinant protein as an <unk> tTG testing should be done first as it is an easier test to perform . An equivocal result on tTG testing should be followed by anti @-@ endomysial antibodies . 
 Guidelines recommend that a total serum IgA level is checked in parallel , as people with coeliac with IgA deficiency may be unable to produce the antibodies on which these tests depend ( " false negative " ) . In those people , IgG antibodies against transglutaminase ( IgG @-@ tTG ) may be diagnostic . 
 If all these antibodies are negative , then it should be determined anti @-@ DGP antibodies ( antibodies against <unk> gliadin peptides ) . IgG class anti @-@ DGP antibodies may be useful in people with IgA deficiency . In children younger than two years , anti @-@ DGP antibodies perform better than anti @-@ endomysial and anti @-@ transglutaminase antibodies tests . 
 Because of the major implications of a diagnosis of coeliac disease , professional guidelines recommend that a positive blood test is still followed by an endoscopy / <unk> and biopsy . A negative serology test may still be followed by a recommendation for endoscopy and duodenal biopsy if clinical suspicion remains high . 
 Historically three other antibodies were measured : anti @-@ <unk> ( ARA ) , anti @-@ gliadin ( AGA ) and anti @-@ endomysial ( EMA ) antibodies . ARA testing , however , is not accurate enough for routine diagnostic use . Serology may be unreliable in young children , with anti @-@ gliadin performing somewhat better than other tests in children under five . Serology tests are based on indirect immunofluorescence ( <unk> , gliadin and <unk> ) or ELISA ( gliadin or tissue transglutaminase , tTG ) . 
 Antibody testing may be combined with HLA testing if the diagnosis is unclear . TGA and EMA testing are the most sensitive serum antibody tests , but as a negative HLA @-@ DQ type excludes the diagnosis of coeliac disease , testing also for HLA @-@ DQ2 or DQ8 maximises sensitivity and negative predictive values . However , widespread use of HLA typing to rule out coeliac disease is not currently recommended . 
 = = = Endoscopy = = = 
 An upper endoscopy with biopsy of the duodenum ( beyond the duodenal bulb ) or jejunum is performed to obtain multiple samples ( four to eight ) from the duodenum . Not all areas may be equally affected ; if biopsies are taken from healthy bowel tissue , the result would be a false negative . Even in the same <unk> fragment , different degrees of damage may be present . 
 Most people with coeliac disease have a small intestine that appears to be normal on endoscopy before the biopsies are examined . However , five findings have been associated with a high specificity for coeliac disease : scalloping of the small bowel folds ( pictured ) , paucity in the folds , a mosaic pattern to the mucosa ( described as a " cracked @-@ mud " appearance ) , prominence of the <unk> blood vessels , and a nodular pattern to the mucosa . 
 European guidelines suggest that in children and adolescents with symptoms which are compatible with coeliac disease , the diagnosis can be made without the need for intestinal biopsy if anti @-@ tTG antibodies titres are very high ( 10 times the upper limit of normal ) . 
 Until the 1970s , biopsies were obtained using metal capsules attached to a suction device . The capsule was swallowed and allowed to pass into the small intestine . After x @-@ ray verification of its position , suction was applied to collect part of the intestinal wall inside the capsule . Often @-@ utilised capsule systems were the Watson capsule and the Crosby – Kugler capsule . This method has now been largely replaced by fibre @-@ optic endoscopy , which carries a higher sensitivity and a lower frequency of errors . 
 Capsule endoscopy ( CE ) allows identification of typical mucosal changes observed in coeliac disease but has a lower sensitivity compared to regular endoscopy and histology . CE is therefore not the primary diagnostic tool for coeliac disease . However , CE can be used for diagnosing T @-@ cell lymphoma , ulcerative <unk> and adenocarcinoma in refractory or complicated coeliac disease . 
 = = = Pathology = = = 
 The classic pathology changes of coeliac disease in the small bowel are categorised by the " Marsh classification " : 
 Marsh stage 0 : normal mucosa 
 Marsh stage 1 : increased number of intra @-@ epithelial lymphocytes ( <unk> ) , usually exceeding 20 per 100 enterocytes 
 Marsh stage 2 : proliferation of the crypts of <unk> 
 Marsh stage 3 : partial or complete villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy 
 Marsh stage 4 : hypoplasia of the small intestine architecture 
 Marsh 's classification , introduced in 1992 , was subsequently modified in 1999 to six stages , where the previous stage 3 was split in three <unk> . Further studies demonstrated that this system was not always reliable and that the changes observed in coeliac disease could be described in one of three stages : 
 A representing lymphocytic infiltration with normal villous appearance ; 
 B1 describing partial villous atrophy ; and 
 B2 describing complete villous atrophy . 
 The changes classically improve or reverse after gluten is removed from the diet . However , most guidelines do not recommend a repeat biopsy unless there is no improvement in the symptoms on diet . In some cases , a deliberate gluten challenge , followed by biopsy , may be conducted to confirm or refute the diagnosis . A normal biopsy and normal serology after challenge indicates the diagnosis may have been incorrect . 
 In untreated coeliac disease , villous atrophy is more common in children younger than three years , but in older children and adults , it is common to find minor intestinal lesions ( duodenal <unk> ) with normal intestinal villi . 
 = = = Other diagnostic tests = = = 
 At the time of diagnosis , further investigations may be performed to identify complications , such as iron deficiency ( by full blood count and iron studies ) , folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency and hypocalcaemia ( low calcium levels , often due to decreased vitamin D levels ) . Thyroid function tests may be requested during blood tests to identify hypothyroidism , which is more common in people with coeliac disease . 
 <unk> and osteoporosis , mildly and severely reduced bone mineral density , are often present in people with coeliac disease , and investigations to measure bone density may be performed at diagnosis , such as dual @-@ energy X @-@ ray <unk> ( <unk> ) scanning , to identify risk of fracture and need for bone protection medication . 
 = = = Gluten withdrawal = = = 
 Although blood antibody tests , biopsies , and genetic tests usually provide a clear diagnosis , occasionally the response to gluten withdrawal on a gluten @-@ free diet is needed to support the diagnosis . Currently , gluten challenge is no longer required to confirm the diagnosis in patients with intestinal lesions compatible with coeliac disease and a positive response to a gluten @-@ free diet . Nevertheless , in some cases , a gluten challenge with a subsequent biopsy may be useful to support the diagnosis , for example in people with a high suspicion for coeliac disease , without a biopsy confirmation , who have negative blood antibodies and are already on a gluten @-@ free diet . Gluten challenge is discouraged before the age of 5 years and during pubertal growth . The alternative diagnosis of non @-@ coeliac gluten sensitivity may be made where there is only symptomatic evidence of gluten sensitivity . Gastrointestinal and <unk> symptoms of people with non @-@ coeliac gluten sensitivity can be similar to those of coeliac disease , and improve when gluten is removed from the diet , after coeliac disease and wheat allergy are reasonably excluded . 
 A careful interpretation of the symptomatic response is needed , as a lack of response in a person with coeliac disease may be due to continued ingestion of small amounts of gluten , either voluntary or inadvertent , or be due to other commonly associated conditions such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( <unk> ) , lactose intolerance , fructose , sucrose , and sorbitol malabsorption , and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency , among others . In untreated coeliac disease , these are often transient conditions derived from the intestinal damage . They normally revert or improve several months after starting a gluten @-@ free diet , but may need temporary interventions such as supplementation with pancreatic enzymes , dietary restrictions of lactose , fructose , sucrose or sorbitol containing foods , or treatment with oral antibiotics in the case of associated bacterial overgrowth . In addition to gluten withdrawal , some people need to follow a low @-@ <unk> diet or avoid consumption of commercial gluten @-@ free products , which are usually rich in preservatives and additives ( such as sulfites , <unk> , nitrates and <unk> ) and which might have a role in triggering functional gastrointestinal symptoms . 
 = = Screening = = 
 There is significant debate as to the benefits of screening . Some studies suggest that early detection would decrease the risk of osteoporosis and anaemia . In contrast , a cohort study suggested that people with undetected coeliac disease had a beneficial risk profile for cardiovascular disease ( less overweight , lower cholesterol levels ) . There is limited evidence that screen @-@ detected cases benefit from a diagnosis in terms of morbidity and mortality ; hence , population @-@ level screening is not presently thought to be beneficial . 
 In the United Kingdom , the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) recommends screening for coeliac disease in people with newly diagnosed chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome , as well as in type 1 diabetics , especially those with insufficient weight gain or unexplained weight loss . It is also recommended in autoimmune thyroid disease , dermatitis herpetiformis , and in the first @-@ degree relatives of those with confirmed coeliac disease . 
 In 2016 the United States Preventative Services Task Force found inadequate evidence for benefits or harms from screening people at any age who do not have symptoms . 
 Serology has been proposed as a screening measure , because the presence of antibodies would detect some previously undiagnosed cases of coeliac disease and prevent its complications in those people . However , serologic tests have high sensitivity only in people with total villous atrophy and have very low ability to detect cases with partial villous atrophy or minor intestinal lesions . Testing for coeliac disease may be offered to those with commonly associated conditions . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 At present , the only effective treatment is a lifelong gluten @-@ free diet . No medication exists that will prevent damage or prevent the body from attacking the gut when gluten is present . Strict adherence to the diet allows the intestines to heal , leading to resolution of all symptoms in most cases and , depending on how soon the diet is begun , can also eliminate the heightened risk of osteoporosis and intestinal cancer and in some cases sterility . The diet can be cumbersome ; failure to comply with the diet may cause relapse . 
 <unk> input is generally requested to ensure the person is aware which foods contain gluten , which foods are safe , and how to have a balanced diet despite the limitations . In many countries , gluten @-@ free products are available on prescription and may be reimbursed by health insurance plans . Gluten @-@ free products are usually more expensive and harder to find than common gluten @-@ containing foods . Since ready @-@ made products often contain traces of gluten , some coeliacs may find it necessary to cook from scratch . 
 The term gluten @-@ free is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence . The exact level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain and controversial . A recent systematic review tentatively concluded that consumption of less than 10 mg of gluten per day is unlikely to cause histological abnormalities , although it noted that few reliable studies had been done . Regulation of the label gluten @-@ free varies . In the European Union , the European Commission issued regulations in 2009 limiting the use of " gluten @-@ free " labels for food products to those with less than 20 mg / kg of gluten , and " very low gluten " labels for those with less than 100 mg / kg . In the United States , the FDA issued regulations in 2013 limiting the use of " gluten @-@ free " labels for food products to those with less than 20 ppm of gluten . The current international Codex <unk> standard allows for 20 ppm of gluten in so @-@ called " gluten @-@ free " foods . Several organisations , such as the Gluten @-@ Free Certification Organization ( <unk> ) , the Celiac <unk> Association ( CSA ) , and the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness ( <unk> ) , also certify products and companies as gluten @-@ free . 
 Even while on a diet , health @-@ related quality of life ( <unk> ) may be lower in people with coeliac disease . Studies in the United States have found that quality of life becomes comparable to the general population after staying on the diet , while studies in Europe have found that quality of life remains lower , although the surveys are not quite the same . Men tend to report more improvement than women . Some have persisting digestive symptoms or dermatitis herpetiformis , mouth ulcers , osteoporosis and resultant fractures . Symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome may be present , and there is an increased rate of anxiety , fatigue , dyspepsia and musculoskeletal pain . 
 = = = Refractory disease = = = 
 Up to 5 % of people have refractory disease , which means they do not improve on a gluten @-@ free diet . This may be because the disease has been present for so long that the intestines are no longer able to heal on diet alone , or because the person is not adhering to the diet , or because the person is consuming foods that are inadvertently contaminated with gluten . If alternative causes have been eliminated , steroids or immunosuppressants ( such as azathioprine ) may be considered in this scenario . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Globally coeliac diseases affects between 1 in 100 and 1 in 170 people . Rates , however , vary between different regions of the world from as few as 1 in 300 to as many as 1 in 40 . In the United States it is thought to affect between 1 in 1750 ( defined as clinical disease including dermatitis herpetiformis with limited digestive tract symptoms ) to 1 in 105 ( defined by presence of IgA TG in blood donors ) . Due to variable signs and symptoms it is believed that about 85 % of people affected are undiagnosed . The percentage of people with clinically diagnosed disease ( symptoms prompting diagnostic testing ) is 0 @.@ 05 – 0 @.@ 27 % in various studies . However , population studies from parts of Europe , India , South America , Australasia and the USA ( using serology and biopsy ) indicate that the percentage of people with the disease may be between 0 @.@ 33 and 1 @.@ 06 % in children ( but 5 @.@ 66 % in one study of children of the predisposed <unk> people ) and 0 @.@ 18 – 1 @.@ 2 % in adults . Among those in primary care populations who report gastrointestinal symptoms , the rate of coeliac disease is about 3 % . The rate amongst adult blood donors in Iran , Israel , Syria and Turkey is 0 @.@ 60 % , 0 @.@ 64 % , 1 @.@ 61 % and 1 @.@ 15 % , respectively . 
 People of African , Japanese and Chinese descent are rarely diagnosed ; this reflects a much lower prevalence of the genetic risk factors , such as HLA @-@ B8 . People of Indian ancestry seem to have a similar risk to those of Western Caucasian ancestry . Population studies also indicate that a large proportion of coeliacs remain undiagnosed ; this is due , in part , to many clinicians being unfamiliar with the condition and also due to the fact it can be asymptomatic . Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men . A large multicentre study in the U.S. found a prevalence of 0 @.@ 75 % in not @-@ at @-@ risk groups , rising to 1 @.@ 8 % in symptomatic people , 2 @.@ 6 % in second @-@ degree relatives ( like grandparents , aunt or uncle , grandchildren , etc . ) of a person with coeliac disease and 4 @.@ 5 % in first @-@ degree relatives ( siblings , parents or children ) . This profile is similar to the prevalence in Europe . Other populations at increased risk for coeliac disease , with prevalence rates ranging from 5 % to 10 % , include individuals with Down and Turner syndromes , type 1 diabetes , and autoimmune thyroid disease , including both hyperthyroidism ( overactive thyroid ) and hypothyroidism ( underactive thyroid ) . 
 Historically , coeliac disease was thought to be rare , with a prevalence of about 0 @.@ 02 % . The reason for the recent increases in the number of reported cases is unclear . It may be at least in part due to changes in diagnostic practice . There also appears to be an approximately 4 @.@ 5 fold true increase that may be due to less exposure to bacteria and other pathogens in Western environments .

 Humans first started to cultivate grains in the Neolithic period ( beginning about 9500 BCE ) in the Fertile Crescent in Western Asia , and it is likely that coeliac disease did not occur before this time . Aretaeus of Cappadocia , living in the second century in the same area , recorded a <unk> syndrome with chronic diarrhoea , causing a debilitation of the whole body . His " <unk> Affection " ( coeliac from Greek <unk> <unk> , " abdominal " ) gained the attention of Western medicine when Francis Adams presented a translation of Aretaeus 's work at the Sydenham Society in 1856 . The patient described in Aretaeus ' work had stomach pain and was atrophied , pale , feeble and incapable of work . The diarrhoea manifested as loose stools that were white , malodorous and flatulent , and the disease was intractable and liable to periodic return . The problem , Aretaeus believed , was a lack of heat in the stomach necessary to digest the food and a reduced ability to distribute the digestive products throughout the body , this incomplete digestion resulting in the diarrhoea . He regarded this as an affliction of the old and more commonly affecting women , explicitly excluding children . The cause , according to Aretaeus , was sometimes either another chronic disease or even consuming " a copious draught of cold water . " 
 The paediatrician Samuel Gee gave the first modern @-@ day description of the condition in children in a lecture at Hospital for Sick Children , Great Ormond Street , London , in 1887 . Gee acknowledged earlier descriptions and terms for the disease and adopted the same term as Aretaeus ( coeliac disease ) . He perceptively stated : " If the patient can be cured at all , it must be by means of diet . " Gee recognised that milk intolerance is a problem with coeliac children and that highly starched foods should be avoided . However , he forbade rice , sago , fruit and vegetables , which all would have been safe to eat , and he recommended raw meat as well as thin slices of toasted bread . Gee highlighted particular success with a child " who was fed upon a quart of the best Dutch mussels daily . " However , the child could not bear this diet for more than one season . 
 Christian Archibald Herter , an American physician , wrote a book in 1908 on children with coeliac disease , which he called " intestinal infantilism . " He noted their growth was retarded and that fat was better tolerated than carbohydrate . The eponym Gee @-@ Herter disease was sometimes used to acknowledge both contributions . Sidney V. Haas , an American paediatrician , reported positive effects of a diet of bananas in 1924 . This diet remained in vogue until the actual cause of coeliac disease was determined . 
 While a role for carbohydrates had been suspected , the link with wheat was not made until the 1940s by the Dutch paediatrician Dr. Willem Karel Dicke . It is likely that clinical improvement of his patients during the Dutch famine of 1944 ( during which flour was scarce ) may have contributed to his discovery . Dicke noticed that the shortage of bread led to a significant drop in the death rate among children affected by coeliac disease from greater than 35 % to essentially zero . He also reported that once wheat was again available after the conflict , the mortality rate soared to previous levels . The link with the gluten component of wheat was made in 1952 by a team from Birmingham , England . <unk> atrophy was described by British physician John W. <unk> in 1954 on samples taken at surgery . This paved the way for biopsy samples taken by endoscopy . 
 Throughout the 1960s , other features of coeliac disease were elucidated . Its hereditary character was recognised in 1965 . In 1966 , dermatitis herpetiformis was linked to gluten sensitivity . 
 = = Social and culture = = 
 May has been designated as " Coeliac Awareness Month " by several celiac organizations . 
 = = = Christian churches and the Eucharist = = = 
 Speaking generally , the various denominations of Christians celebrate a Eucharist in which a wafer or small piece of sacramental bread from wheat bread is blessed and then eaten . A typical wafer weighs about half a gram . Wheat flour contains around 10 to 13 % gluten , so a single communion wafer may have more than 50 mg of gluten , an amount which will harm the health of many people with coeliac especially if consumed every day ( see Diet above ) . 
 Many Christian churches offer their communicants gluten @-@ free alternatives , usually in the form of a rice @-@ based cracker or gluten @-@ free bread . These include the United Methodist , Christian Reformed , Episcopal , the Anglican Church ( Church of England , UK ) and Lutheran . Catholics may receive from the Chalice alone , or ask for gluten @-@ reduced hosts ; gluten @-@ free ones however are not considered to still be wheat bread , and hence invalid matter . 
 = = = = Roman Catholic position = = = = 
 Roman Catholic doctrine states that for a valid Eucharist , the bread to be used at Mass must be made from wheat . In 2002 , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith approved German @-@ made low @-@ gluten hosts , which meet all of the Catholic Church 's requirements , for use in Italy ; although not entirely gluten @-@ free , they were also approved by the Italian Celiac Association . Some Catholics with coeliac have requested permission to use rice wafers ; such petitions have always been denied . As Catholic doctrine affirms that Christ is wholly and equally present under both species , it is possible to receive under the species of wine alone . 
 The issue is more complex for priests . As a celebrant , a priest is , for the fullness of the sacrifice of the Mass , absolutely required to receive under both species . On 24 July 2003 , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated , " Given the centrality of the celebration of the Eucharist in the life of a priest , one must proceed with great caution before admitting to Holy Orders those candidates unable to ingest gluten or alcohol without serious harm . " 
 By January 2004 , extremely low @-@ gluten Church @-@ approved hosts had become available in the United States , Italy and Australia . 
 = = = Passover = = = 
 The Jewish festival of Pesach ( Passover ) may present problems with its obligation to eat matzo , which is unleavened bread made in a strictly controlled manner from wheat , barley , spelt , oats , or rye . This rules out many other grains that are normally used as substitutes for people with gluten sensitivity , especially for Ashkenazi Jews , who also avoid rice . Many kosher @-@ for @-@ Passover products avoid grains altogether and are therefore gluten @-@ free . Potato starch is the primary starch used to replace the grains . Consuming matzo is mandatory on the first night of Pesach only . Jewish law holds that one should not seriously endanger one 's health in order to fulfill a commandment . Thus , a person with severe coeliac disease is not allowed , let alone required , to eat any matzo other than gluten @-@ free matzo . The most commonly used gluten @-@ free matzo is made from oats . 
 = = Research directions = = 
 Various other approaches are being studied that would reduce the need of dieting . All are still under development , and are not expected to be available to the general public for a while . 
 Three main approaches have been proposed as new therapeutic modalities for coeliac disease : gluten detoxification , modulation of the intestinal permeability , and modulation of the immune response . 
 Using genetically engineered wheat species , or wheat species that have been selectively bred to be minimally immunogenic , may allow the consumption of wheat . This , however , could interfere with the effects that gliadin has on the quality of dough . Alternatively , gluten exposure can be minimised by the ingestion of a combination of enzymes ( prolyl endopeptidase and a barley glutamine @-@ specific cysteine endopeptidase ( EP @-@ B2 ) ) that degrade the putative 33 @-@ mer peptide in the duodenum . 
 Alternative treatments under investigation include the inhibition of <unk> , an endogenous signalling protein linked to increased permeability of the bowel wall and hence increased presentation of gliadin to the immune system . One inhibitor of this pathway is <unk> acetate , which is currently scheduled for phase 3 clinical trials . Other modifiers of other well @-@ understood steps in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease , such as the action of HLA @-@ DQ2 or tissue transglutaminase and the MICA / <unk> interaction that may be involved in the killing of enterocytes . 
 Attempts to modulate the immune response with regard to coeliac disease are mostly still in phase I of clinical testing ; one agent ( <unk> @-@ B ) has been evaluated in a phase II clinical trial on the basis of small @-@ intestinal biopsies taken from people with coeliac disease before and after gluten exposure . 
 = Our Lady Star of the Sea and St Winefride , Amlwch = 
 Our Lady Star of the Sea and St Winefride , Amlwch is a Roman Catholic church in Amlwch , a town on the island of Anglesey , north Wales . It was built in the 1930s to a design by an Italian architect , Giuseppe Rinvolucri , using reinforced concrete . The church is in the shape of an upturned boat , reflecting Amlwch 's maritime heritage , and is dedicated to Our Lady , Star of the Sea ( a title of St Mary ) and St Winefride , a Welsh saint . 
 The church is a Grade II * listed building , a designation given to " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " , because it is a " remarkable inter @-@ war church " , built to " a highly unusual and experimental design " . The Twentieth Century Society has called it " a rare and unique church " , and it has also been called " one of Britain 's most avant @-@ garde churches " . 
 = = Location and history = = 
 The church is on the <unk> road , about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) to the west of Amlwch , a town on the north coast of Anglesey , Wales . It is dedicated to St Mary ( under the title Our Lady , Star of the Sea ) and to St Winefride , a 7th @-@ century Welsh noblewoman who is also venerated at St Winefride 's Well , Flintshire . Construction of the church began in 1932 , when the foundations were excavated . It was completed in 1937 , and the church was consecrated in the same year . The architect was Giuseppe Rinvolucri , an Italian engineer from Piedmont , who settled in Conwy , north Wales , because his English wife was suffering from tuberculosis . His specialist field was the design of Roman Catholic churches , and other – more conventional – examples of his work can be found in Abergele and Porthmadog , also in north Wales . 
 The church is part of Caernarfon Deanery within the Diocese of Wrexham . As of 2012 , the parish priest is Father Michael Ryan , of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate . The parish of Amlwch also includes the churches of St David , Cemaes Bay , and Our Lady of Lourdes , <unk> . 
 Damage from the weather and deterioration in the concrete meant that the church closed for worship in 2004 , requiring worshippers to attend services elsewhere on Anglesey . Demolition was a possibility in 2006 . An appeal launched raised the estimated £ 1 @.@ 2 million to £ 1 @.@ 4 million necessary for repairs , which included replacing the roof coverings , redecorating internally and externally , and repairing the steps . An application for planning permission for the work was submitted in May 2008 to the Isle of Anglesey County Council . An application for a grant of £ 840 @,@ 000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund was rejected on 18 March 2009 , with the committee concerned about the proposed new extension ( terming it " inappropriate " ) , although recognising the " high heritage merit " of the proposal . Cadw ( the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales ) made a grant of £ 150 @,@ 000 in 2007 ; the National Churches Trust made a grant of £ 10 @,@ 000 in June 2010 ; and other bodies and individuals made donations to the appeal . The church reopened after its restoration on 1 May 2011 with a Mass celebrated by the Bishop of Wrexham , Edwin Regan . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 Built of reinforced concrete , the building is designed in the style of an upturned boat , and the design has a " nautical theme " with elements such as porthole windows . This is a deliberate reference to Amlwch 's history as a port town and its position on the coast . The church has six concrete parabolic arch " ribs " along the outside , with portholes on the base plinth between each rib . 
 The main entrance is at the south end of the church at the top of some stone steps on either side . A window ( shaped , like all the others in the church , like a star ) set in mosaic is positioned above the door , and there is a stone cross at the top of the facade . The concrete of the church is dressed with stone on the south side , nearest the main road . The ribs on the outside are visible inside the building ; in between them , there are patterns of lights and coloured marble panels on the lower parts of the interior walls . The vestry is to the rear of the church , and there is a parish hall , built from masonry , underneath the church . The altar was replaced in 1995 and again on the reopening of the church in 2011 , when a carved crucifix , which was brought to Amlwch from a former convent in Liverpool , was also dedicated . The porch houses a sepulchral slab , dating from the latter half of the 13th century . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 The church is a Grade II * listed building – the second @-@ highest of the three grades of listing , designating " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " . It was given this status on 12 December 2000 , and has been listed as " a remarkable inter @-@ war church " . Cadw describes it as " striking and individual " , and " a highly unusual and experimental design which exploits the plastic qualities of its constructional material to create a powerfully expressive religious building . " 
 A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes it as " a very impressive building " , that " must surely be the most unusual church in Anglesey . " A 2009 guide to the buildings of north Wales describes it as " a piece of Italian architectural daring " . Referring to the French structural engineer Eugène Freyssinet , who worked with concrete , the guide rhetorically asks , " What inspired this Futurist church , closer to Freyssinet 's 1920s airship hangars at Orly , Paris , than to Catholic church design , and so unlike the conservatism of Anglesey building ? " Writing before the church reopened , the heritage writer and journalist Simon Jenkins has said that the church was worth a visit for the exterior alone , even though it was closed . He noted the " sweeping parabolic arches , perhaps inspired by airship hangars or by upturned boats in Amlwch harbour " , as well as the " bold gable with sloping sides " at the west end , concluding " This church must be saved . " It has also been described as " one of Britain 's most avant @-@ garde churches " . The Twentieth Century Society has said that it is " by far [ Rinvolucri 's ] best work " , calling it " a rare and unique church " . It noted the " highly individual interpretation of its seaside setting " , with a " strikingly modern " parabolic design and a " monumental almost pyramidal aesthetic " at the entrance . A 2011 guide to religious buildings in Wales ( written before the church reopened ) described it as " most unusual " , but added that the fittings were " not worthy of the building " . It also noted one writer 's words that " no Catholic church ( nor any church of another denomination ) built in Britain between the wars has the frankly radical character of Amlwch . "

 Hyogo ( <unk> , Hyōgo @-@ ku ) is one of nine wards of Kobe in Japan . It has an area of 14 @.@ 56 km2 and a population of 106 @,@ 322 ( as of January 1 , 2015 ) . 
 The area 's location with a natural harbour near the Akashi Strait which links Osaka Bay and the Seto inland sea has been an important location throughout the history of Japan . The capital of Japan was located in the area for a short period in the 12th century . Today the area is an important manufacturing zone . 
 The modern ward of Hyogo was formed as Sōsai @-@ ku ( <unk> , , lit . " Minato West Ward " ) when the City of Kobe adopted the system of wards in 1931 . Its name was changed to Hyogo in 1933 and its current boundaries were settled in 1971 . The floral emblem of the ward is the pansy .

 The features of the natural harbour around Wadamisaki peninsula has meant the port in Hyogo has been an important gateway to the Seto inland sea since the 8th century Nara period . In the 12th century , in the latter part of the Heian period , Taira no Kiyomori recognized the strategic benefit of the location and developed the harbor , including the building of <unk> ( ja : <unk> ) , a man @-@ made island completed in 1173 and described as 37 <unk> in size in the The Tale of the Heike . Kiyomori , the de facto ruler of Japan between 1160 and 1180 , moved his official residence to Fukuhara , in what is modern @-@ day Hyogo . Fukuhara became the capital of Japan for a brief period near the end of Kiyomori 's rule . A monument erected shortly after his death , the Kiyomori @-@ <unk> , stands in the gardens of a shrine opposite Kiyomori Bridge , also named in his honour . 
 = = = Edo @-@ Meiji periods = = = 
 During the Edo period Hyogo was within the Yatabe District of Settsu Province . Although Japan was placed under isolation by the ruling Tokugawa shogunate , Hyogo Port remained an important route for domestic trade . Given its importance , Hyogo Port was under the direct administration of the Shogunate via the Osaka <unk> @-@ <unk> . In 1868 , at the end of the Edo period , Hyogo port was one of the first to be opened to foreign vessels , ending Japan 's 250 @-@ year long isolation . 
 As part of the Shogunate 's efforts to protect Japan from Western colonial forces , the defence of Hyogo Port was upgraded with the construction of the Wadamisaki Battery , one of six land batteries built around Osaka Bay under the design of Count Katsu Kaishū . It was completed in 1864 after 18 months of construction at a cost of 25 @,@ 000 ryō . The outer enceinte was built of granite from the <unk> Islands and the inner two @-@ storey structure was made of keyaki ( Japanese elm ) wood harvested from the <unk> and <unk> Mountains in Kobe . In 1921 the battery was the first place in Hyogo Prefecture to be designated as a historic site by the prefectural government . 
 Also , the Wadamisaki Lighthouse was completed in 1871 under the guidance of the " father of Japanese lighthouses " , Englishman Richard Henry Brunton , who was brought to Japan by the Shogunate under an 1867 agreement with the United Kingdom to build five western @-@ style lighthouses around Osaka Bay . The original lighthouse , which was first illuminated in 1872 , was a wooden octagonal structure . This was replaced with a 17m tall , three @-@ story , steel hexagonal structure in 1884 . The steel lighthouse was moved to the Suma <unk> ( Seaside ) Park in Suma @-@ ku in 1967 and in September 1998 it was registered as a national tangible cultural asset under the name Old Wadamisaki Lighthouse ( <unk> , Kyū @-@ Wadamisaki <unk> ) .

The area of Hyogo town which lay east of the Minato River became part of <unk> @-@ ku ( <unk> , , lit . " Minato East Ward " ) . On 1 January 1933 Sōsai 's name was changed to Hyogo in recognition of the area 's historic name . 
 = = = Bombing during World War II = = = 
 The concentration of military and industrial manufacturing facilities including Kobe Steel , Kawanishi Aircraft Company Kawasaki Aircraft Industries and the Kawasaki and Mitsubishi Shipyards made the city of Kobe a primary target of bombing by the United States during World War II . It suffered the highest fatality rate of the five major Japanese cities ( the others being Tokyo , Yokohama , Nagoya and Osaka ) . 
 The first attack upon Kobe was by one B @-@ 25 bomber as a part of the Dolittle Raid on 18 April 1942 . With Japan 's success in expanding its territory through south @-@ east Asia at the time , an attack by foreign aircraft was not expected at the time and it was reported that some residents even waved flags at the plane as it flew overhead , thinking it was a Japanese aircraft . One resident of Hyogo ward was the only fatality of the bombing of Kobe on that day . 
 In 1945 the United States changed tactics from strategic bombing of military sites to indiscriminate bombing of cities , including the use of incendiary cluster bombs . The first successful firebombing raid against Japan was an attack on Kobe on 4 February 1945 . The bombing was centred upon Hyogo and Minato wards . 
 With the final attack upon eastern Kobe in June 1945 , the United States command determined that Kobe had been destroyed to the extent that further attacks upon the city were not required . By the end of the war , Kobe had suffered more than 8 @,@ 000 deaths due to the air raids . Hyogo suffered the highest toll in terms of both lives lost and buildings destroyed .

A total of 6 @,@ 434 people died in the earthquake , of which the city of Kobe recorded fire as the cause of death of 528 people . 
 Infrastructure in Hyogo was also significantly damaged by the earthquake . The underground <unk> Station collapsed and brought down National Route 28 that runs above it . The loss of lives and infrastructure saw Hyogo lose a significant portion of its population ; the ward 's population has failed to return to its 1994 level twenty years later .

 Sōsai @-@ ku was one of seven wards established when the system of wards was adopted by the city on 1 September 1931 . Following the name change to Hyogo in 1933 , the next change occurred on 1 May 1945 when the city restructured the wards , with Hyogo expanded to include Minato @-@ ku , the western portion of <unk> @-@ ku , and the portion of Hayashida @-@ ku that lay east of the Hyogo Canals . 
 On 1 March 1947 the city of Kobe expanded due to the merger of the town of Arima and nine other villages from the districts of Muko , Arima and Akashi . Of these , Arima town and the villages Yamada in Muko and <unk> in Arima District became a part of Hyogo ward . On 1 July 1951 the villages of Hata , <unk> and <unk> that were located in Arima District merged into Kobe and Hyogo ward . On 15 October 1955 Nagao village in Arima merged into Kobe and Hyogo ward . This was followed by the village <unk> of <unk> District on 1 February 1958 . This expansion northwards made Hyogo the largest of Kobe 's wards in size , encompassing <unk> of Kobe 's <unk> . 
 On 1 August 1973 the area of Hyogo north of the <unk> mountains , consisting of all of the former villages from the districts of Arima , <unk> and Muko , were split from Hyogo to create the new Kita @-@ ku . This reduced Hyogo to its current size of 14 @.@ 56 km2 .

 = Scarygirl = 
 Scarygirl ( also stylized as <unk> ) is an adventure @-@ platformer video game for the Xbox 360 's Xbox Live Arcade , PlayStation 3 's PlayStation Network and the personal computer . Prior to being adapted as a console and PC game , Scarygirl was a graphic novel by Nathan Jurevicius , a Flash game , and a downloadable title for the PlayStation Portable . Developed by <unk> and published by Square Enix , Scarygirl was released on January 18 , 2012 with an ESRB rating of 10 + . 
 Scarygirl places the player in control of a girl who is sent from her home to a far @-@ away city on a rescue mission . The girl is able to jump , grapple , and hover her way though seven game worlds , either alone or with another player in a cooperative multiplayer mode . Combat is handled through combining strings of light and heavy attacks , with grapple @-@ based attacks becoming available once enemies take enough damage . <unk> praised for Jurevicius ' art , <unk> received otherwise mixed reviews upon its release . Critics found fault with both the control scheme and its combat system , although boss battles did receive some praise . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Scarygirl is a side @-@ scrolling adventure game with platforming and action components . Players control the protagonist Scarygirl as she navigates and fights through twenty @-@ one stages spread across seven distinct worlds . The game uses a 2.5D visual style and employs parallax scrolling to create visual depth . 
 Outside of combat , <unk> navigates the game world by running , jumping , gliding , and using her tentacle arm to grapple onto objects . Scarygirl eventually gains access to a feather attachment that can replace the hook on her tentacle arm , allowing Scarygirl to hover and reach otherwise inaccessible locations . Stages contain deadly traps that have to be avoided , often by grappling over them , and most stages contain at least two paths through the stage , although after choosing one the option to backtrack and take the other route exists . Crystals , which can be used to purchase combat upgrades for both combat and exploration , and heart fragments , which increase Scarygirl 's maximum health , are scattered throughout stages . In order to get all of the crystals and heart fragments , players will have to traverse both paths through stages that have more than one path . 
 In combat , Scarygirl has light and heavy attacks , which can be strung together to form combos . Heavy attacks have the ability to launch enemies in the air . After enemies take a certain amount of damage , they can be grappled and thrown or used to bludgeon other enemies . Additional moves are available for purchase using crystals , such as a grappling attack that heals Scarygirl or an attack that turns Scarygirl 's tentacle into a club with a smashing attack . Additional weapons , which replace the hook at the end of Scarygirl 's tentacle arm , are also available for purchase , and include an anchor and a fan . Scarygirl charges a meter when she attacks , and is able to enter a " Rage Mode " once it is fully charged . In rage mode Scarygirl gains the ability to eat enemies , restoring her own health in the process . 
 Scarygirl does not have an online component , but does support two player cooperative multiplayer . The second player is able to drop in or out of the game at any time , and plays as Bunniguru . Bunniguru is faster than Scarygirl and has a different , martial arts inspired , set of moves in combat , but lacks Scarygirl 's ability to grapple . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the game , the player controls Scarygirl , a young girl with an eye patch , a sewn @-@ shut mouth and a hook @-@ capped tentacle for one arm . The girl , an orphan , was raised and cared for by Blister , an intelligent , mustached octopus that built the girl a tree house to live in . Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man , the girl consults Bunnyguru , a rabbit that lives in the bottom of the tree where the girl makes her home . Bunniguru offers a vision of a city far away from the girl 's home . The girl is then sent by Blister into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life is losing its leaves , where she discovers that one of the keepers of the forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru 's vision , and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest 's safe return . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Scarygirl received mixed reviews upon its release . The game received a Metacritic score of 66 for the PlayStation 3 and a 63 for the Xbox 360 . Critics praised the game 's visuals , with Nathan Meunier of GamesRadar stating that the game " really stands out " as one of the " more visually impressive and creatively designed downloadable offerings " in recent years . Peter Eykemans of IGN wrote that " the art highlights the journey " and that " the overall aesthetics are beautiful " . Edge Magazine , in a highly critical review , called the game " successful only as an interactive showcase of Jurevicius ' art " . Simon Parkin of Eurogamer , in a review that was much kinder to the game overall , also called the art and animation " the strongest aspects of the game " . Several reviewers compared the game 's visuals to the style developed by Tim Burton . 
 The gameplay itself was viewed in a significantly harsher light . Several critics took issue with the controls , which were viewed as imprecise , both in the platforming and in the combat phases of the game . Reviewers took issue with various parts of the combat system . Several reviewers found combat against large groups of enemies to be frustrating . Jason Venter of GameSpot singled out a specific combat stage taking place on an airship as particularly demonstrative of the game 's shortcomings in combat , calling the scenario " cheap " . Venter did , however , have praise for the game 's boss battles , which he described as " a nice change of pace because victory relies more on pattern memorization and intuition than manic combat " . Edge Magazine echoed the praise for the boss battles , and both reviews lamented that such segments were not more common . 
 Reviews were mixed on the co @-@ op mode . While reviewers praised Bunnyguru 's martial arts @-@ inspired moveset , they did not like Bunnyguru 's inability to grapple , which limits the second player 's utility in some situations . Edge Magazine also complained that even when there were two players playing , the camera would always center on Scarygirl , even if that meant that Bunnyguru wound up off screen . Reviews were also mixed for the exploration and collection aspects of the game . Parkin of Eurogamer described these aspects by stating that : " <unk> paths through levels add the illusion of depth but , for players who wish to collect 100 per cent of the gems in a stage , trekking backwards and forwards through a level is an inelegant slog " . Peter Eykemans of IGN found that the game 's branching paths created difficulty for players seeking to gain a rating of " perfection " , but goes on to recommend the game to people that enjoy searching for collectables . 
 = The World 's Greatest Tag Team = 
 The World 's Greatest Tag Team is a professional wrestling tag team , which also used the name Wrestling 's Greatest Tag Team . The team consisted of Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin . Originally formed in World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , they started out captained by Kurt Angle , during which time they were known as Team Angle . They also wrestled for several other independent promotions . 
 Haas and Benjamin made their debut on the SmackDown ! brand in December 2002 , and won the WWE Tag Team Championship in February 2003 . After losing the championship in May , Haas and Benjamin were fired from Team Angle , and changed their name to The Best Damn Tag Team Period , before settling on The World 's Greatest Tag Team . They won the championship back in July , and their second reign lasted for two months . They continued to compete on SmackDown ! , until March 2004 , when Benjamin was moved to the Raw brand as part of the Draft Lottery . 
 The team reformed in December 2006 on the Raw brand , and competed against numerous teams , although they were unsuccessful in winning the World Tag Team Championship . The team was split again in November 2007 , when Benjamin moved to the ECW brand , but later reformed briefly back on SmackDown in May 2009 . In 2010 , the team reformed on the independent circuit , and began competing regularly for Ring of Honor ( ROH ) , where they are former two @-@ time ROH World Tag Team Champions .

 The tag team made their debut on the December 26 , 2002 edition of WWE 's SmackDown ! . Paul Heyman introduced Benjamin and Haas under the name Team Angle as a " gift " to his top client Kurt Angle . Team Angle quickly involved themselves in a scripted rivalry with Chris Benoit and Edge , defeating them on January 30 , 2003 to become the number one contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship . 
 The following week , on February 6 , they won the WWE Tag Team Championship by defeating Los Guerreros . They continued their rivalry with Benoit , facing him and Brock Lesnar at No Way Out in a handicap match , where they teamed with their mentor Angle in a losing effort . After a successful title defense at WrestleMania XIX against Los Guerreros and the team of Chris Benoit and Rhyno , Team Angle lost the championship to Eddie Guerrero and his new partner Tajiri at Judgment Day on May 18 in a ladder match . Shortly afterwards , on June 12 , Angle confronted Benjamin and Haas about the losing streak they had been in for a couple of weeks , and , after they blamed him for losing the Tag Team Championship and began to question his leadership , he fired them both from Team Angle . For a few weeks they wrestled against Angle , both in singles matches and in tag team matches . 
 Soon after the breakup , Benjamin and Haas referred to themselves as The Best Damn Tag Team Period and then The Self @-@ Proclaimed World 's Greatest Tag Team , or The World 's Greatest Tag Team for short . They went on to recapture the WWE Tag Team Championship from Eddie Guerrero and Tajiri on July 3 . Following their win , they competed against the teams of Rey Mysterio and Billy Kidman and The APA , before losing the championship to the reformed Los Guerreros team two months later on September 18 . After their loss The World 's Greatest Tag Team continued competing against Los Guerreros in an attempt to regain the championship , but were unsuccessful . 
 In early 2004 , The World 's Greatest Tag Team began a scripted rivalry with The APA , and beat them at the No Way Out pay @-@ per @-@ view . Following their loss , The World 's Greatest Tag Team mocked The APA , leading to The APA attacking them . Both the team of Scotty Too Hotty and Rikishi and the Basham Brothers also got involved in the brawl , leading to a fatal four @-@ way match at WrestleMania XX for the WWE Tag Team Championship . At WrestleMania , Scotty Too Hotty and Rikishi retained the championship .

 The group stayed together until March 22 , 2004 when , during the Draft Lottery , Benjamin was drafted to the Raw brand , breaking up The World 's Greatest Tag Team . On the Raw brand Benjamin was quickly added to the WWE Intercontinental Championship picture , first challenging for it at Bad Blood in June 2004 against Randy Orton . He eventually won the championship at Taboo Tuesday in October by defeating Chris Jericho , and held the championship for approximately eight months , eventually losing it to Carlito in June 2005 . He held the championship twice more during 2006 . 
 After Benjamin 's draft , Haas gained Miss Jackie as a valet and teamed with Rico to win the WWE Tag Team Championship on April 22 , 2004 . After a brief spell in singles competition , Haas joined forces with Hardcore Holly briefly , before being released from WWE in July 2005 . Haas wrestled in the independent circuit for nearly a year , wrestling in Jersey All Pro Wrestling and other independent promotions before returning to WWE on the Raw brand in April 2006 .

 On April 17 , 2006 , Haas returned to WWE as part of the Raw brand , defeating his former tag team partner , Benjamin , the very same night . On the December 4 episode of Raw , after Benjamin pinned Super Crazy , Haas entered the ring , berated Crazy , and celebrated with a bewildered Benjamin . The next week , Benjamin announced The World 's Greatest Tag Team was officially back in a segment with Cryme Tyme . They defeated The Highlanders in a match later that same night . They then started a scripted rivalry with Cryme Tyme , but were largely unsuccessful , including a tag team turmoil match at New Year 's Revolution . They finally pinned Cryme Tyme , however , ending their undefeated streak , on the January 29 , 2007 episode of Raw . 
 On April 2 , The World 's Greatest Tag Team was unsuccessful in defeating the team of Ric Flair and Carlito , but defeated them in a rematch on April 16 when Haas distracted Carlito , allowing Benjamin to gain the win . They won again two weeks later when Carlito turned on Flair , attacking him and allowing The World 's Greatest Tag Team to win via countout . They then challenged the Hardy Boyz for the World Tag Team Championship at One Night Stand in a ladder match , but were unsuccessful . 
 Following this , The World 's Greatest Tag Team began a rivalry with Paul London and Brian Kendrick after losing to the duo in their debut match on Raw . A few weeks later , London defeated Benjamin in a singles match , however , on the July 23 episode of Raw , The World 's Greatest Tag Team got a tag team win over London and Kendrick to end the rivalry . For this match they were announced as The ( Self @-@ Proclaimed ) World 's Greatest Tag Team , having been previously using simply The World 's Greatest Tag Team since their reformation . 
 Following this , Benjamin and Haas competed against the teams of Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes and Super Crazy and Jim Duggan until November , when the team was disbanded due to Benjamin joining the ECW roster . Benjamin was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2008 Supplemental Draft .

The following week on the May 15 episode of SmackDown , Benjamin and Haas unofficially reunited and competed against John Morrison and CM Punk in a losing effort . At Judgment Day , Haas escorted Benjamin to the ring for his match against Morrison . On June 29 , Benjamin was traded back to the ECW brand . On February 28 , 2010 , WWE announced that Haas had been released from his contract , and two months later , on April 22 , WWE announced that Benjamin had also been released .

The duo later stated that they would collectively be known as Wrestling 's Greatest Tag Team . At Glory By Honor IX Haas and Benjamin were defeated by Hero and Castagnoli in a non – title match . On December 8 , 2010 , Haas and Benjamin returned to Ohio Valley Wrestling , more than seven years after their previous match for the promotion . In their return match they defeated The Elite ( Adam Revolver and Ted <unk> ) . The following day they took part in their first Ring of Honor Wrestling tapings , defeating the Bravado Brothers ( Harlem and Lance ) . The following day , at the second set of television tapings , Haas and Benjamin defeated the All Night Express of Kenny King and Rhett Titus , before participating in an eight @-@ man tag team match , in which Haas and <unk> teamed with the Briscoe Brothers against the Kings of Wrestling and the All @-@ Night Xpress .

 = Premastication = 
 Premastication , pre @-@ chewing , or kiss feeding is the act of chewing food for the purpose of physically breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of masticating the food by themselves . This is often done by the mother or relatives of a baby to produce baby food capable of being consumed by the child during the weaning process . The chewed food in the form of a bolus is transferred from the mouth of one individual to another , either directly mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth , via utensils , hands , or is further cooked or processed prior to feeding . 
 The behaviour was common throughout human history and societies and observed in non @-@ human animals . While premastication is less common in present @-@ day Western societies it was commonly practiced , and is still done in more traditional cultures . Although the health benefits of premastication are still being actively studied , the practice appears to confer certain nutritional and immunological benefits to the infant , provided that the caretaker is in good health and not infected by pathogens . 
 = = Behavioural roots = = 
 Premastication and mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth feeding in humans is postulated to have evolved from the regurgitation of food from parent to offspring or male to female ( courtship feeding ) and has been observed in numerous mammals and animals of other species . For instance , food begging behaviour observed in young wolves , wild dogs and certain gulls species , which involves the young approaching the beak or mouth of the adult with their own whereupon gaping their mouths or nuzzling , the adult would regurgitate portions of food to feed the young . However , in the aforementioned animals , this nuzzling behaviour and other types of mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth contact are also used for bonding , socialization , and courtship . 
 = = = In apes = = = 
 Young orangutans also beg for food by such contact and accordingly their caretakers regurgitate to feed them . Indeed , behaviours of mouth to mouth feeding of premasticated food and ritualized mouth to mouth contact for bonding has been observed in anthropoid great apes such as gorillas , orangutans , and chimpanzees . All of this supports the idea that human behaviours of kissing and feeding of premastication foods , either directly or indirectly from the mouth , have their behavioural roots in higher animals and ancestral great apes . 
 = = = Human kiss precursor = = = 
 In all human cultures premastication / kiss @-@ feeding or kissing between mother and infant has been observed in all with kissing believed to be a socially ritualized form of feeding premasticated food . There is high similarity in the execution of kiss @-@ feeding and human kisses ( e.g. French kiss ) ; in the former , the tongue is used to push food from mother to child with the child receiving both the mother 's food and tongue in sucking movements , and the latter simply forgoes the premasticated food . In fact , observations across various species and cultures confirms that the act of kissing and premastication have most likely evolved from the similar relationship @-@ based feeding behaviours . 
 = = History and culture = = 
 Written records of premastication have been found in Ancient Egypt , though the practice likely extends back into prehistoric times to non @-@ human ancestors . For instance , in the Ancient Egyptian Ebers medical papyrus , a mother was instructed to give a medical remedy to a child through premastication . In the fifth century A.D. Roman culture , premastication of infants ' food by caretakers was also common , though the lack of sanitation along with the practice contributed to infant mortality . Infants in Medieval Europe were fed an assortment of mashed , premasticated food or bread softened with liquids . 
 Due to attitudes in Western medicine in the 1940s and 1950s , Native American and Fijian cultures and societies were strongly dissuaded from premastication due to concerns about the hygiene of the practice . However , the lack of knowledge regarding premastication and its prohibition by missionaries and doctors instead caused severe anemia in the infants of the population , or resulted in malnourished infants and children deprived of nourishment . 
 Although less prevalent in modern post @-@ industrial Western societies , the offering of premasticated foods to infants is found in many traditional cultures and offers their infant numerous benefits . In North America , premastication is still commonly used by Black and Hispanic mothers , and commonly used by women of Inuit and Aleut peoples . 
 In many human cultures , the act of premastication and direct mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth feeding is linked with the showing of affection , known as kiss feeding . In the Manus cultures of the Admiralty Islands , the act of premastication has been used by a women to remind children and descendants of their obligations to her . Some human cultures such as the people of Papua New Guinea in fact use mouth to mouth contact primarily for feeding premasticated food , with sexual kissing only observed after the arrival of Europeans . This form of feeding is believed to have evolved into the modern human acts of kissing and French kissing . 
 Many Western societies have strong <unk> toward premastication , which have been compared to their similar criticisms and aversion towards breastfeeding in previous generations for similar rationale , with the same societies finding breastfeeding to be a disagreeable practice performed only by the uneducated lower classes or <unk> foreign cultures . For instance , in the late 1800s the medical community of Texas was embroiled in a debate on premastication , with those supporting the practice arguing its benefits and those against it stating that it is " filthy and <unk> and ... barbaric " . 
 = = Health = = 
 The act of premastication is commonly found in all human societies and populations , although it is less prevalent in some than others . The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro @-@ nutrients . Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre @-@ chewed foods , the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour . Furthermore , discouraging premastication as prevention to disease <unk> may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s . In the end , the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child . The true scope of the benefits of premastication and its prevalences in <unk> societies is still under active research , though there appears to be some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice . 
 = = = Advantages = = = 
 = = = = <unk> supplement = = = = 
 Premastication is complementary to breastfeeding in the health practices of infants and young children , providing large amounts of carbohydrate and protein nutrients not always available through breast milk , and micronutrients such as iron , zinc , and vitamin B12 which are essential nutrients present mainly in meat . Compounds in the saliva , such as <unk> also help increase B12 availability by protecting the vitamin against stomach acid . 
 = = = = Infant intake of heme iron = = = = 
 Meats such as beef were likely premasticated during human evolution as hunter @-@ gatherers . This animal @-@ derived bioinorganic iron source is shown to confer benefits to young children ( two years onwards ) by improving growth , motor , and cognitive functions . In earlier times , premastication was an important practice that prevented infant iron deficiency . 
 Meats provide <unk> iron that are more easily absorbed by human physiology and higher in bioavailability than non @-@ heme irons sources , and are recommended sources of iron for infants . 
 = = = = Anti @-@ allergy and immunological benefits = = = = 
 The infant can benefit from immunological resistance to infections and immunological hypersensitivity such as asthma can be inhibited through the antimicrobial , anti @-@ inflammatory , growth factors , and nutrient transporters in the mother 's saliva . Related to the hygiene hypothesis , it is postulated that early childhood exposure to rich microflora from premastication may be important in priming the immune system and reducing allergic responses . 
 Premastication may itself promote the development of infant immune systems through antibody generators in the mother 's saliva , which help prevent the development of allergies in the infant . Early infant feeding of premasticated foods such as eggs and nuts alongside breastfeeding could help promote immune tolerance and help moderate allergic responses . The practice of premastication is postulated to play an important role in the development of oral <unk> and help prevent the occurrence of autoimmune diseases in the infant . Although the rise in allergic and autoimmune diseases in Western societies has not been directly linked to the decrease of premastication in these same societies , researchers believe that these two phenomena are related . 
 = = = = Parental enzymes = = = = 
 <unk> foods allow for better infant digestion through the presence of saliva enzymes lacking in infants . Alpha @-@ amylase from maternal saliva aids in digestion of starches fed to a baby . This may be important in the developed nations since " ... milk supplements containing starch are used frequently and if these are introduced into feeds at an early stage , digestion of the starch will require the action of salivary amylase ... " Children being fed mainly plant based diets by vegetarian parents also benefit from the more prevalent and different types of digestive enzymes in premasticated food . Fat digesting lingual lipase in adult saliva can also help infant digestion and fat absorption since infants generally do not produce enough of these enzymes in their digestive tracts to efficiently process the fats they consume . 
 = = = Disadvantages = = = 
 = = = = Transmission of diseases = = = = 
 Premastication can transmit a wide range of diseases and pathogens from infected parents to their infants through the parents ' saliva and open mouth ulcers , including HIV @-@ AIDS as well as possibly hepatitis B virus and Helicobacter pylori . Given the prevalence of HIV in populations of lower @-@ income and poorer nation @-@ states who practice premastication extensively , the practice is likely an important method for transmission of the virus in their populations . In Chile , the practice is also associated with HIV transmission from caregivers who were unaware of their infection to children under their care . 
 Some state that since most mothers in the West will already know if they are carrying HIV or other serious infectious agents , mothers exercising caution who wish to breastfeed or <unk> for their children should not be dissuaded by experts who use science to justify their own personal disapproval . 
 = = = = Establishment of cavity causing bacteria = = = = 
 The widespread belief that dental caries causing bacteria from the mother 's oral ecology can be transmitted to the infant through the saliva , resulting in bacterial colonization and a strong predisposition to tooth decay in the child was already falsified by a voluminous study in 1994 . Instead , it was found that children develop a higher resistance to caries if there are frequent mother – infant salivary contacts . 
 = Quebec Expedition = 
 The Quebec Expedition , or the Walker Expedition to Quebec , was a British attempt to attack Quebec in 1711 in Queen Anne 's War , the North American theatre of the War of Spanish Succession . It failed because of a shipping disaster on the Saint Lawrence River on 22 August 1711 , when seven transports and one storeship were wrecked and some 850 soldiers drowned ; the disaster was at the time one of the worst naval disasters in British history . 
 The expedition was planned by the administration of Robert Harley , and was based on plans originally proposed in 1708 . Harley decided to mount the expedition as part of a major shift in British military policy , emphasizing strength at sea . The expedition 's leaders , Admiral Hovenden Walker and Brigadier @-@ General John Hill , were chosen for their politics and connections to the crown , and its plans were kept secret even from the Admiralty . Despite the secrecy , French agents were able to discover British intentions and warn authorities in Quebec . 
 The expedition expected to be fully provisioned in Boston , the capital of colonial Massachusetts , but the city was unprepared when it arrived , and Massachusetts authorities had to scramble to provide even three months ' supplies . Admiral Walker also had difficulty acquiring experienced pilots and accurate charts for navigating the waters of the lower Saint Lawrence . The expedition reached the Gulf of Saint Lawrence without incident , but foggy conditions , tricky currents , and strong winds combined to drive the fleet toward the northern shore of the Saint Lawrence near a place now called Pointe @-@ aux @-@ Anglais , where the ships were wrecked . Following the disaster , Walker abandoned the expedition 's objectives and returned to England . Although the expedition was a failure , Harley continued to implement his " blue water " policy . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1710 , late in the War of Spanish Succession , a mixed force of British regulars and American colonists captured the French fort at Port Royal on the northwestern coast of Acadia ( present @-@ day Annapolis Royal , Nova Scotia ) . Francis Nicholson , the leader of the expedition , brought news of the victory to London , where he and Jeremiah Dummer , who represented the Province of Massachusetts Bay in London , lobbied for an expedition against the heartland of New France , Quebec . 
 The British government , however , was in some turmoil , and in August 1710 , the ministry of Lord Godolphin fell . Queen Anne replaced him with Robert Harley , a political opponent of the Duke of Marlborough , who had also fallen out of favour . Harley wanted to change Britain 's military strategy , implementing a " blue water " policy that emphasized strength at sea , at the cost of a reduced army . He also sought to blunt Marlborough 's continuing influence with a victory of his own devising . To these ends , he authorised expeditions by land and sea to capture Quebec ; however , he fell ill , so most of the work of organisation was done by his Secretary of State , Henry St. John ( the future Lord Bolingbroke ) . 
 The basic plan followed one first proposed by Samuel Vetch in 1708 for the 1709 campaign season , with the main thrust to be a naval expedition carrying a combined force of regular army forces and provincial militia . Rear Admiral of the White Sir Hovenden Walker was given overall command of the expedition , with Brigadier John Hill in command of the land forces . Walker , who was promoted to admiral in March , had led a squadron on an expedition to the West Indies earlier in the war that had failed to produce significant results , and may have been chosen due to his friendship with St. John and his Tory sympathies . St. John probably chose Hill to curry favour at court : he was the brother of Queen Anne 's confidante Abigail Masham . The duchess of Marlborough , presumably echoing the opinions of her husband , wrote of Hill that " he was no good as a soldier " . Five regiments from Marlborough 's force in Flanders were added to two from Britain to build a force of some 5 @,@ 000 land troops . This force sailed from ports in southern England in April and May 1711 . Its destination was a tightly guarded secret : Walker was not immediately informed of its destination , nor were the Lords of the Admiralty informed , and it was provisioned only with sufficient supplies for a typical voyage in European waters in an attempt to mislead spies .

 Francis Nicholson arrived in Boston in early June 1711 with news and details of the expedition plans , and a meeting of provincial governors was quickly arranged in New London , Connecticut . The naval expedition was to include provincial militia raised in the New England colonies , while Nicholson led a provincial force raised in provinces from Connecticut to Pennsylvania up the Hudson River and down Lake Champlain to Montreal . The provincial forces that were to go with Walker 's expedition were led by Samuel Vetch , who became the governor of Nova Scotia in 1710 . They consisted of 1 @,@ 500 men , most from Massachusetts , with smaller contingents from New Hampshire and Rhode Island . 
 The fleet arrived in Boston on 24 June , and the troops were disembarked onto Noddle 's Island ( the present @-@ day location of Logan International Airport ) . The size of the force was , according to historian Samuel Adams Drake , " the most formidable that had ever crossed the Atlantic under the English flag . " Since the fleet had left with insufficient supplies , its organizers expected it to be fully provisioned in Boston . Since the number of soldiers and sailors outnumbered the population of Boston at the time , this proved a daunting task . Laws were passed to prevent merchants from price @-@ gouging , but sufficient provisions were eventually acquired . Additional laws were passed penalizing residents found harbouring deserters from the fleet ; apparently the attraction of colonial life was sufficient that this was a significant problem during the five weeks the expedition was in Boston . 
 During the expedition 's sojourn in Boston , Walker attempted to enlist pilots experienced in navigating the Saint Lawrence River . To his dismay , none were forthcoming ; even Captain Cyprian Southack , reputed to be one of the colony 's best navigators , claimed he had never been beyond the river 's mouth . Walker intended to rely principally on a Frenchman he had picked up in Plymouth prior to the fleet 's departure . Samuel Vetch , however , deeply distrusted the Frenchman , writing that he was " not only an ignorant , pretending , idle , drunken Fellow " , but that he " is come upon no good Design " . Following this report , Walker also forced a Captain Jean Paradis , the captain of a captured French sloop , to serve as navigator . The charts Walker accumulated were notably short in details on the area around the mouth the Saint Lawrence , as was the journal Sir William Phips kept of his 1690 expedition to Quebec , which Walker also acquired . Walker interviewed some participants in the Phips expedition , whose vague tales did nothing to relieve his concerns about what he could expect on the river . These concerns prompted him to detach his largest and heaviest ships for cruising duty , and he transferred his flag to the 70 @-@ gun Edgar .

 On 30 July , the fleet set sail from Boston . It consisted of a mix of British and colonial ships , including nine ships of war , two bomb vessels , and 60 transports and tenders . It carried 7 @,@ 500 troops and about 6 @,@ 000 sailors . By 3 August the fleet reached to coast of Nova Scotia , and Samuel Vetch piloted the fleet around Cape Breton and Cape North and into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence . 
 On the morning of the 18 August , just as the expedition was about to enter the Saint Lawrence River , the wind began to blow hard from the northwest , and Walker was forced to seek shelter in Gaspé Bay . On the morning of the 20th , the wind veered to the southeast , and he was able to advance slowly past the western extremity of Anticosti Island before it died down and thick fog blanketed both shore and fleet . By the 22nd , the wind had freshened from the southeast , and there were intermittent breaks in the fog , but not sufficient to give sight of land . At this point the fleet was west of Anticosti at a point where the Saint Lawrence was about 70 miles ( 110 km ) wide , but it narrowed noticeably at a point where the river 's North Shore made a sharp turn , running nearly north @-@ south . This area , near what is now called Pointe @-@ aux @-@ Anglais , includes a number of small islands , including Île @-@ aux @-@ <unk> ( Egg Island ) , and numerous rocky shallows . After consulting his pilots , Walker gave the signal to head the fleet roughly southwest at about 8 : 00 pm . 
 Walker had thought he was in mid @-@ stream when he issued the order . In fact , he was about seven leagues ( about 20 miles ( 32 km ) ) north of his proper course , and in the grasp of strong currents which steered his ships towards the northwest . Aided by an easterly wind , the fleet was gradually closing on the north @-@ south shore near Île @-@ aux @-@ <unk> . When Captain <unk> reported to Walker that land had been sighted around 10 : 30 pm , presumably dead ahead , Walker assumed that the fleet was approaching the south shore , and ordered the fleet to wear , and bring @-@ to on the other tack , before he went to bed . This manoeuvre put the fleet onto a more northerly heading . Some minutes later , an army captain named Goddard roused Walker , claiming to see breakers ahead . Walker dismissed the advice and the man , but Goddard returned , insisting that the admiral " come upon deck myself , or we should certainly be lost " . 
 Walker came on deck in his dressing gown , and saw that the ship was being driven toward the western lee shore by the east wind . When the French navigator came on deck , he explained to Walker where he was ; Walker immediately ordered the anchor cables cut , and beat against the wind to escape the danger . Two of the warships , Montague and Windsor , had more difficulty , and ended up anchored for the night in a precarious situation , surrounded by breakers . Throughout the night , Walker heard sounds of distress , and at times when the fog lifted , ships could be seen in the distance being ground against the rocks . One New Englander wrote that he could " hear the shrieks of the sinking , drowning , departing souls . " Around 2 : 00 am the wind subsided , and then shifted to the northwest , and most of the fleet managed to stand away from the shore . 
 It took three days to discover the full extent of the disaster , during which the fleet searched for survivors . Seven transports and one supply ship were lost . Walker 's initial report was that 884 soldiers perished ; later reports revised this number down to 740 , including women attached to some of the units . Historian Gerald Graham estimates that about 150 sailors also perished in the disaster . After rescuing all he could , Walker and Hill held a war council on 25 August . After interviewing a number of the pilots , including Samuel Vetch , the council decided " that by reason of the Ignorance of the Pilots <unk> the Men of War " , the expedition should be aborted . Vetch openly blamed Walker for the disaster : " The late disaster cannot , in my humble opinion , be anyways imputed to the difficulty of navigation , but to the wrong course we steered , which most unavoidably carried us upon the north shore . " 
 The fleet sailed down the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and came to anchor at Spanish River ( now the harbour of Sydney , Nova Scotia ) on 4 September , where a council was held to discuss whether or not to attack the French at Plaisance . Given the lateness of the season , insufficient supplies to overwinter in the area , and rumours of strong defences at Plaisance , the council decided against making the attack , and sailed for England . 
 = = Return = = 
 Francis Nicholson 's land expedition learned of the naval disaster when it was encamped near Lake George ; Nicholson aborted the expedition . He was reported to be so angry that he tore off his wig and threw it to the ground . 
 The expedition 's fortunes did not improve on the return voyage . Walker had written to New York requesting the HMS Feversham and any available supply ships to join him ; unbeknownst to him , the Feversham and three transports ( Joseph , Mary , and Neptune ) were wrecked on the coast of Cape Breton on 7 October with more than 100 men lost . The fleet returned to Portsmouth on 10 October ; Walker 's flagship , the Edgar , blew up several days later , possibly due to improper handling of gunpowder . Walker lost a number of papers as a result , and claimed that the journal of William Phips was lost in the blast . 
 Despite the magnitude of the expedition 's failure , the political consequences were relatively mild . The failure was an early setback in Robert Harley 's " blue water " policy , which called for the aggressive use of the navy to keep England 's enemies at bay ; however , Harley continued to implement it , withdrawing further resources from European military campaigns . Since the project had been organised by the current government , it was also not interested in delving deeply into the reasons for its failure . Walker was sympathetically received by the queen , and both he and Hill were given new commands . Walker eventually wrote a detailed and frank account of the expedition , based on his memory as well as surviving journals and papers ; it is reprinted in Graham . Walker was stripped of his rank in 1715 ( amid a larger change of power including the accession of King George I ) , and died in 1728 . 
 Popular sentiment in England tended to fault the colonies for failing to properly support the expedition , citing parsimony and stubbornness as reasons . These sentiments were rejected in the colonies , where Nicholson and Governor Dudley instead blamed Walker . The relations between the military leadership and the colonial populations was not always cordial during the army 's stay outside Boston , and foreshadowed difficult relations between civilians and military occupiers in the political conflicts that preceded the American Revolutionary War . One of Hill 's officers wrote of the " ill Nature and <unk> of these People , whose Government , Doctrine , and Manners , whose <unk> and canting , are unsupportable " , and further commented that unless they were brought under firmer control , the colonists would " grow more stiff and disobedient every Day . " Colonists noted with some disgust the fact that both Walker and Hill escaped censure for the expedition 's failure . 
 = = French actions = = 
 Authorities in France were alerted as early as March 1711 that Nicholson was organising an expedition against Quebec . They also knew the composition of Hill 's force , but were apparently unaware of his destination until July . The Governor @-@ general of New France , the marquis de Vaudreuil , sent Louis Denys de La Ronde to Boston ostensibly to oversee a prisoner exchange in early June . La Ronde also had secret instructions that he was to try to convince authorities to withhold support from expeditions sent from England . La Ronde , who coincidentally arrived in Boston on 8 June , the same day as Nicholson , was apparently unsuccessful in his attempts to influence British colonial opinion . Nicholson became suspicious of his behaviour and eventually had him arrested . When copies of his secret instructions were found aboard a captured French vessel and brought to Boston , La Ronde was held in Boston until November . 
 Governor Vaudreuil was warned again in August that expeditions against Quebec and Montreal were being organised . He called out his militia , rallied local Indians , and prepared his defences as best he could , putting the whole colony on a war footing . In mid @-@ October word reached Quebec that large ships were approaching , heightening tensions further . It turned out they were French , and on board was a scout Vaudreuil had sent downriver on 19 September to watch for the British fleet . The scout reported finding the wreckage of seven ships and an estimated 1 @,@ 500 bodies . Although locals were already plundering through the wreckage , the colony organised a formal salvage operation that recovered items like anchors , chains , tents , and cannons ; the items recovered were auctioned .

 The fleet is listed in the order of sail drawn up by Admiral Walker . Ships generally sailed two abreast . 
 = USS New Mexico ( BB @-@ 40 ) = 
 USS New Mexico ( BB @-@ 40 ) was a battleship in service with the United States Navy from 1918 to 1946 . She was the lead ship of a class of three battleships , and the first ship to be named for the state of New Mexico . Her keel was laid down on 14 October 1915 at the New York Navy Yard , she was launched on 23 April 1917 , and was commissioned on 20 May 1918 . She was the first ship with a turbo @-@ electric transmission , which helped her reach a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Shortly after completing initial training , New Mexico escorted the ship that carried President Woodrow Wilson to Brest , France to sign the Treaty of Versailles . The interwar period was marked with repeated exercises with the Pacific and Atlantic Fleets , use as a trial ship for PID controllers , and a major modernization between March 1931 and January 1933 . 
 The ship 's first actions during World War II were neutrality patrols in the Atlantic Ocean . She returned to the Pacific after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , and participated in shore bombardments during operations at Attu and Kiska , Tarawa , the Marshall Islands , the Mariana and Palau islands , Leyte , Luzon , and Okinawa . These were interspersed with escort duties , patrols , and refits . The ship was attacked by kamikazes on several occasions . New Mexico was present in Tokyo Bay for the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on 2 September 1945 . Four days later , she sailed for the United States , and arrived in Boston on 17 October . 
 New Mexico was decommissioned in Boston on 19 July 1946 , and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 February 1947 . The ship was sold for scrapping to the Lipsett Division of Luria Bros in November 1947 , but attempts to bring the ship to Newark , New Jersey for breaking up were met by resistance from city officials . City fireboats were sent to block the passage of the battleship and the Lipsett tugboats , while the United States Coast Guard declared intentions to guarantee safe passage . The Under Secretary of the Navy Department was sent to defuse what the media began to call the " Battle of Newark Bay " , with the city agreeing to the breaking up of New Mexico and two other battleships before scrapping operations in Newark Bay ceased , and Lipsett under instructions to dismantle the ships in a set timeframe or suffer financial penalties . Scrapping commenced in November and was completed by July 1948 . 
 = = Description = = 
 New Mexico was 624 feet ( 190 m ) long overall and had a beam of 97 ft 5 in ( 29 @.@ 69 m ) and a draft of 30 ft ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) . She displaced 31 @,@ 000 long tons ( 32 @,@ 000 t ) as designed and up to 32 @,@ 000 long tons ( 33 @,@ 000 t ) at full load . She had a crew of 1 @,@ 084 officers and enlisted men . The ship 's main armament comprised twelve 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) / 50 caliber guns mounted three guns in each of four turrets , with each turret weighing 980 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 080 short tons ) . The secondary battery consisted of fourteen 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 51 caliber guns , with all of them being removed in May 1942 . The anti @-@ aircraft defense consisted of four 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) / 50 caliber guns , which were soon replaced by a battery of eight 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 25 caliber guns . As was standard for capital ships of the period , she carried two 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes in deck mounted torpedo launchers . 
 New Mexico 's main armored belt was 13 @.@ 5 in ( 343 mm ) thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and 8 in ( 203 mm ) elsewhere . The main battery gun turrets had 18 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) thick faces , and the supporting barbettes had 13 in ( 330 mm ) of armor plating on their exposed sides . Armor that was 3 @.@ 5 in ( 89 mm ) thick protected the decks . The conning tower had 11 @.@ 5 in ( 290 mm ) thick sides . 
 = = = Propulsion system = = = 
 Unlike the other two battleships of this class which used geared turbines , New Mexico had turbo @-@ electric transmission , in which the high @-@ speed steam turbine drove a set of generators providing electricity to electric motors turning the propeller shafts . The engines were rated at 27 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 20 @,@ 500 kW ) and had nine Babcock & Wilcox boilers , generating a top speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . She had a range of 8 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 200 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 General Electric ran an advertisement titled " The " Constitution " of To @-@ day — Electronically Propelled " with a drawing of New Mexico next to USS Constitution . The ad touted the battleship as " the first of any nation to be electrically propelled " . The electrical generating plant was said to put out 27 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 20 @,@ 500 kW ) for a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . GE called it one of the most important achievements of the scientific age and related it to consumer products noting that " so general are the applications of electricity to the needs of mankind that scarcely a home or individual today need be without the benefits of General Electric products and service . " An illustrated booklet titled " The Electric Ship " was offered free of charge upon request . 
 A comparison of the turbo @-@ electric propulsion with the more conventional direct @-@ drive turbine design used on her sister ships showed that the conventional design generated 2 @.@ 5 times the power per ton of machinery and required 1 / 3 the floor area although at the cost of 20 % greater fuel consumption , always a concern for the U.S. Navy given Pacific distances . The turbo @-@ electric design allowed for the equipment to be split between smaller watertight compartments , which was a potential benefit should parts of the engine space be attacked and flooded . There was a design weakness in that all electrical connections went through a single switch room , which could entirely disable the ship were that room to be hit . Saratoga , which used a similar propulsion design , lost power for five minutes when it was hit by a torpedo in 1942 . The scheme of watertight subdivisions was further weakened by large ventilation trunks passing through bulkheads and glass windows in the generator room bulkhead .

 New Mexico 's keel was laid down on 14 October 1915 by the New York Navy Yard . She was launched on 23 April 1917 . The ship was sponsored by Miss Margaret Cabeza De Baca , the daughter of the recently deceased Governor of New Mexico , Ezequiel Cabeza De Baca ( died on 28 February 1917 ) . She was commissioned on 20 May 1918 , with Captain Ashley Herman Robertson in charge . 
 After New Mexico passed her initial trials , she left New York Harbor on 15 January 1919 for Brest , to escort the ship George Washington . The George Washington was carrying President Woodrow Wilson on his return from the Versailles Peace Conference to the U.S. She returned to the Hampton Roads area on 27 February . New Mexico became the flagship of the newly created United States Pacific Fleet on 16 July and three days later she left Hampton for San Pedro , California . She passed through the Panama Canal and arrived at San Pedro on 9 August . Two of her 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) / 51 caliber guns were removed in a later overhaul , in 1922 . 
 The next twelve years consisted of training exercises and maneuvers in the Pacific and the Caribbean , with the Pacific and the Atlantic Fleets . She also took several cruises to South American ports and was used for the early development of PID controllers . Invented by the Russian @-@ American engineer Nicolas Minorsky for the automated steering of ships , the devices have since become widespread in control engineering . After that , in 1925 , she took a cruise to Australia and New Zealand . 
 After her training exercises in the Atlantic and the Pacific were finished , New Mexico was overhauled and modernized at the Philadelphia Harbor by the Navy from March 1931 to January 1933 . The overhaul included the replacement of her turbo @-@ electric drive with more conventional geared turbines , which were made by Curtis . In addition , New Mexico received eight 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 25 caliber anti @-@ aircraft guns , replacing the four 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) guns that had been previously installed . After the overhaul , she returned the Pacific to continue training exercises and the development of tactical operations . 
 Even in 1936 during Fleet Problem XVII , she was one of the fastest battleships in the Navy , having a maximum speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) , higher than most U.S. battleships , but only 1 @.@ 5 knots ( 2 @.@ 8 km / h ; 1 @.@ 7 mph ) faster than Japan 's slowest battleships . This led to the development of the North Carolina @-@ class battleship and South Dakota @-@ class battleship . In 1937 , she arrived in Hawaii to sail to Dutch Harbor , Alaska , where she and several other ships were sent to help the Navy evaluate fighting in sub @-@ arctic conditions .

 As the prospect of war grew , New Mexico 's was based at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , from 6 December 1940 to 20 May 1941 . She then left Pearl Harbor to join the Atlantic fleet at Norfolk on 16 June for neutrality patrol duty along the Atlantic coast . In the Atlantic , she served on three 7 – 14 day " shifts " following destroyers to escort convoys across the Atlantic . On 10 December , while headed to Hampton Roads ( en route to the west coast after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor ) , she accidentally rammed and sank the U.S. freighter Oregon south of the Nantucket Lightship off Boston Harbor . She managed to reach the Panama Canal by 17 January 1942 . 
 During an overhaul in May 1942 , at the Puget Sound Navy Yard , she had her secondary battery of twelve 5 in / 51 guns removed to make space for more anti @-@ aircraft guns . After the overhaul , which was completed on 1 August , she departed San Francisco to Hawaii to prepare for action . From 6 December to 22 March 1943 , she escorted convoys and transports to the Fiji Islands . After that , she patrolled the southwestern Pacific , before returning to Pearl Harbor to get ready for the Aleutian Islands Campaign . After her training , on 17 May , she steamed to Adak , which would be her base for the attack on Attu . She later participated in the shelling of Kiska on 21 July , which led to the Japanese evacuation of the island a week later . 
 After the Aleutian Islands Campaign , a refit was undertaken at the Puget Sound Navy Yard . On 25 October , New Mexico returned to Pearl Harbor to practice for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands . On 20 November , while the invasion was underway , she shelled Makin Atoll . During the fighting on the islands the ship was tasked with guarding transports at night when they retreated from the islands , providing anti @-@ aircraft fire for the unloading of supplies and troops , and providing screening fire for the aircraft carriers . After U.S. troops captured the Gilbert Islands on 5 December , New Mexico returned to Pearl Harbor . 
 = = = = 1944 = = = = 
 New Mexico was part of the Marshall Islands invasion force on 12 January 1944 . She shelled Kwajalein and Ebeye from 31 January to 1 February . <unk> at Majuro , on 20 February the ship shelled Wotje , and then the following month also shelled New Ireland and Kavieng . After that , she sailed to the Solomon Islands to practice the attack on the Mariana Islands , stopping at Sydney , in Australia , on the way . 
 In mid @-@ June , New Mexico joined the shelling of Tinian , and also bombarded Saipan and Guam . On 18 June , she helped drive away two air attacks . Later , on 20 June , she escorted transports off the Mariana Islands . Meanwhile , the carrier task force destroyed the Japanese carrier force at the Battle of the Philippine Sea . Later , she escorted troop transports to the naval base of Eniwetok . On 9 July , she sailed to guard escort carriers until 12 July . Her guns later hit Guam on 21 July and kept on shelling the island until 30 July . 
 After the invasion of the Mariana Islands , she received an overhaul at Bremerton , Washington , from October to November . After the overhaul , she arrived in Leyte Gulf to escort reinforcement and supply transports and convoys . She dealt with daily air attacks , as the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the liberation of the Philippines . She departed Leyte Gulf on 2 December to the Palaus , where she later joined a Mindoro @-@ bound convoy . She provided anti @-@ aircraft fire for the convoy and provided cover fire for invading forces . She provided cover for two more days before retiring to the Palaus . 
 = = = = 1945 = = = = 
 New Mexico 's next task in the Philippines was the liberation of Luzon . She took part in the pre @-@ invasion shelling of Lingayen Gulf on 6 January . During the bombardment she came under heavy kamikaze attack , one of which hit her bridge , killing her commanding officer , Captain Robert Walton Fleming , and 29 others . The dead included Lieutenant General Herbert Lumsden , the British representative to General of the Army Douglas MacArthur . A further 87 of her crew were wounded . Bruce Fraser , the commander of the British Pacific Fleet , narrowly escaped death while on her bridge , although his secretary was killed . The guns remained in action as the ship 's crew repaired the damage while the invasion troops were landing on the beaches . 
 More extensive repairs were completed at Pearl Harbor , after which New Mexico sailed to the island of Ulithi to rehearse the invasion of Okinawa as part of a large fire @-@ support group . Her heavy guns opened up on Okinawa on 26 March , and for the next month she continued to support the US troops ashore . On 11 May , she destroyed eight Shinyo suicide boats . 
 While she was approaching her berth in the Hagushi anchorage , just after sunset on 12 May , she was attacked by two kamikazes . One of them plunged into her , the other managed to hit her with its bomb . She was set on fire and 54 members of New Mexico 's crew were killed , while a further 119 were wounded . Swift action led to the fires being extinguished within 30 minutes . On 28 May , she departed for repairs at Leyte , followed by rehearsals for the planned invasion of the Japan . Word of the war 's end reached her when she was at Saipan on 15 August . The next day she sailed for Okinawa to join the occupation force . She entered Sagami Wan on 27 August to support the airborne occupation of Atsugi Airfield . The next day New Mexico passed into Tokyo Bay to witness the Japanese surrender , which took place on 2 September . She departed Tokyo Bay on 6 September , passing Okinawa , Hawaii , and the Panama Canal , before arriving at Boston on 17 October .

 New Mexico was decommissioned in Boston on 19 July 1946 , and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 February 1947 . On 9 November 1947 , she was sold for scrapping to the Lipsett Division of Luria Bros , for $ 381 @,@ 600 . 
 Lipsett decided to tow New Mexico for scrapping at Newark , New Jersey . The proximity of Newark to rail lines made it an ideal location for dismantling the ship and hauling away the steel . In early November 1947 New Mexico departed Boston , towed by two tugs . On 12 November , while off the coast of New York , the tugs pulling the battleship encountered heavy weather and were forced to cut the tow lines . Running lights were kept on aboard New Mexico along with three crewmembers , but the tugs eventually lost sight of the battleship . New Mexico then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day , 35 miles off the coast . The two tugs then secured tow lines and continued the journey to the scrapyard . 
 Newark city officials decided they did not want any more ships scrapped along the city 's waterfront . Newark was implementing a beautification plan for the waterfront , and had allocated $ 70 million for improvements . As such , the city declared that any attempt to bring New Mexico to Newark would be blocked . Two city fireboats , Michael P. Duffy and William T. Brennan , were dispatched and were prepared to use their fire hoses and chemical sprayers to halt Lipsett and New Mexico . In response , Lipsett organized its own force of four tugs , and the United States Coast Guard declared it would guarantee safe passage of New Mexico , provided legal entry was permitted . This showdown was dubbed by the press as the " Battle of Newark Bay " , while the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce announced it would protest Newark 's " slur " of New Mexico 's namesake , through its refusal to admit the battleship . 
 As New Mexico awaited suitable tidal conditions to make the final tow into Newark , the Navy Department sent Under Secretary W. John Kenney to negotiate . After several sessions , he arranged a tenuous agreement between the City of Newark and Lipsett . Newark would allow New Mexico and two other battleships , Idaho and Wyoming , to be scrapped at Newark , but there would be no permanent ship dismantling facility . Lipsett had nine months to dispose of the three ships , or would be subjected to a fine of $ 1 @,@ 000 per day after the deadline . 
 New Mexico finally entered Newark Channel on 19 November , and was greeted by the same Newark fireboats that had earlier been sent to oppose the ship . Newark also arranged to have school children honor the old battleship dockside , with a marching band . New Mexico was subsequently joined by Idaho and Wyoming , where all three were finally dismantled . Scrapping of New Mexico began on 24 November and was completed by July 1948 .

 Dunder Mifflin Paper Company , Inc. is a paper sales company featured in the United States television series The Office . It is analogous to Wernham Hogg in the British original of the series , and <unk> Jennings and <unk> in the French Canadian and French adaptations respectively . Originally , the company was completely fictitious , but eventually the brand was used to sell products at Staples and other office supply outlets . 
 Two websites have been created to support the fictional company , NBC sold branded merchandise at its NBC Universal Store website . Its logo was prominently displayed in several locations in downtown Scranton , Pennsylvania , where the show is set . Scranton has been associated internationally with Dunder Mifflin due to the show 's international reach . In a 2008 St. Patrick 's Day speech in the suburb of Dickson City , then @-@ Prime Minister of Ireland Bertie Ahern made a reference to the city 's fictional branch office . 
 = = Overview = = 
 A fourth @-@ season episode , " Dunder Mifflin Infinity " , said the company was founded in 1949 by Robert Dunder and Robert Mifflin , originally to sell brackets for use in construction . The fifth @-@ season episode " Company Picnic " said that the co @-@ founders met on a tour of Dartmouth College . U.S. News and World Report likens it to many real companies in its size range : " It is facing an increasingly competitive marketplace . Like many smaller players , it just can 't compete with the low prices charged by big @-@ box rivals like Staples , OfficeMax and Office Depot , and it seems to be constantly bleeding corporate customers that are focused on cutting costs themselves . " The show 's creators share this assessment — " It 's basically a Staples , just not as big " , says co @-@ producer Kent Zbornak — as do some of those companies . " Since Dunder Mifflin could be considered among our competitors " , says Chuck Rubin , an Office Depot executive , " I think Michael Scott is actually the perfect person to run their Scranton office . " 
 The company was depicted as based in New York City , with branches in smaller Northeastern cities . Episodes are set in the Scranton branch , but other branches have been mentioned and seen . The now @-@ closed Stamford , Connecticut , branch was seen when Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) transferred there during the first half of the third season . Another episode , " Branch Wars " , gave viewers a brief glimpse of the Utica branch , one of several purportedly in upstate New York . Zbornak says that city was on the short list for where to base the show , with some of its writers having ties to Central New York , and that they always intended for at least a branch office to be located there , for reasons of phonetics . " Utica was just such a different @-@ sounding name than Scranton , " Zbornak says . But also , " we had done a little research and thought our kind of business could survive in Utica . " 
 A Buffalo branch has been mentioned in several episodes , and a Rochester office was also mentioned in the episode titled " Lecture Circuit " . The Dunder Mifflin website also lists a Yonkers branch . Albany rounds out the New York locations , which in a deleted scene in " Stress Relief " is revealed to have closed , leaving three other branches in other states : Akron , Ohio ; Camden , New Jersey ; and Nashua , New Hampshire . In " Company Picnic " , it is announced that the Camden and Yonkers branches have closed , and that the Buffalo branch is about to close . In " Boys and Girls " , a Pittsfield branch was mentioned , until Jan shut it down when their warehouse workers unionized . The episode " Turf War " focuses on the closing of the Binghamton branch , and how reps from the Syracuse branch are competing with Scranton employees for Binghamton 's old clients . 
 Business writer Megan Barnett has pointed out parallels between Dunder Mifflin and the real @-@ life W.B. Mason paper company , based near Boston , in Brockton , Massachusetts . It is similarly regional in focus , serving corporate customers in New England and the Mid @-@ Atlantic states . Like Dunder Mifflin , its original product line ( rubber stamps ) was something other than paper , and it faces stiff competition from national and international chains . It , too , has a branch office in Stamford , but Mason 's has remained open . In 2009 , it had an accounting scandal that resulted in a $ 545 @,@ 000 payment to corporate customers , much as Dunder Mifflin had to deal with the arrest of Ryan Howard for fraud the year before .

 The company 's " clearly dysfunctional " top @-@ down management style is a major source of tension on the show , notes Chicago @-@ based writer <unk> Canon . Corporate headquarters rejects the television commercial Michael created , as he in turn insisted on his own ideas for the commercial and ignored his employees . Ryan Howard ( B. J. Novak ) , who began as a temp , becomes Michael 's new boss because he has an M.B.A. despite never having sold any paper or paper products . Michael , in turn , treats his own employees the same way . The show 's depiction of a dysfunctional corporate culture has led some commentators to liken Dunder Mifflin to the software maker <unk> in Mike Judge 's cult comedy Office Space and the nameless company in which the Dilbert comic strip is set . 
 Dunder Mifflin is also depicted as struggling to accommodate the demands of a diverse workforce . Episodes have focused on sensitivity training sessions and other informal efforts . Sexual harassment has occurred often enough , however , that it has lent its name to an episode . Employment lawyer Julie Elgar started a blog analyzing each episode for plot developments likely to be actionable if they occurred in real life and estimating the legal bill and / or possible verdict the company would incur should a suit be filed — as Michael 's former supervisor , Jan Levenson ( Melora Hardin ) did in one episode , alleging wrongful termination . Greg Daniels , the show 's creator , said many episode plotlines are in fact based on anecdotes recounted during the sensitivity training he and the other members of the show 's cast and crew are required to take annually as employees of NBC , a General Electric subsidiary . The episode " Boys and Girls " showed that the company strongly resisted unionization efforts by its employees , to the point of closing down a branch , as many real companies do or threaten to do in the same situation .

 The office and warehouse of the Scranton branch office are sets on the production company 's office in Van Nuys , California ( a real office was used in the show 's first season ) . The parking lots and exterior of the building are likewise the exterior of the building ( except in the first season , when the building 's exterior was different because a different shooting location was used ) . Since the stage set had no windows , writer Jennifer Celotta 's office was dressed to look like Michael Scott 's when the script called for him or someone else to look out the window into the parking lot . In the second and subsequent seasons , the office interiors and exteriors are at a different location in Van Nuys . 
 Some viewers have presumed that the Pennsylvania Paper & Supply Company 's tower , a downtown Scranton landmark which appears in video footage shot by cast member John Krasinski for the show 's opening credits , is the Dunder Mifflin office .

 = Battle of San Domingo = 
 The Battle of San Domingo was a naval battle of the Napoleonic Wars fought on 6 February 1806 between squadrons of French and British ships of the line off the southern coast of the French @-@ occupied Spanish colonial Captaincy General of Santo Domingo ( San Domingo in contemporary British English ) in the Caribbean . The French squadron , under Vice @-@ Admiral Corentin Urbain Leissègues in the 120 @-@ gun Impérial , had sailed from Brest in December 1805 , one of two squadrons intending to raid British trade routes as part of the Atlantic campaign of 1806 . 
 Separating from the squadron under Contre @-@ Admiral Jean @-@ Baptiste Willaumez in the mid @-@ Atlantic , Leissègues sailed for the Caribbean . After winter storms near the Azores damaged and scattered his squadron , Leissègues regrouped and repaired his ships at the city of Santo Domingo , where a British squadron under Vice @-@ Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth discovered them on 6 February 1806 . Duckworth had abandoned his assigned station off Cadiz in pursuit of Willaumez during December and traveled so far across the Atlantic in pursuit that he was forced to resupply at St. Kitts in the Leeward Islands , where news had reached him of Leissègues ' arrival . 
 By the time French lookouts at Santo Domingo had spotted Duckworth approaching from the southeast , it was too late for Leissègues to escape . Sailing with the wind westwards along the coast , Leissègues formed a line of battle to meet the approaching British squadron , which had split into two divisions . Although his divisions separated during the approach , Duckworth 's lead ships remained in a tight formation and successfully engaged the head of the French line , targeting the flagship Impérial . Under pressure , the French squadron broke apart with the British isolating and capturing three ships before concentrating on the main combat around the French flagship . Severely damaged and surrounded , Leissègues drove Impérial ashore to avoid capture . The remaining French ship of the line , Diomède , followed him . Although most of the crew of these ships scrambled ashore , British boarding parties captured both vessels and set them on fire . The only French ships to escape the battle were three smaller warships , which Duckworth 's squadron had ignored ; they eventually returned to France . 
 Willaumez 's squadron remained at large in the Atlantic until July 1806 , when a hurricane scattered the vessels along the American Seaboard where British patrols were waiting to intercept them . Of the 11 ships that set out in December 1805 , just four eventually returned to France . The crews of the British squadron were decorated for their success , with the exception of Duckworth , who shared in the general thanks but was otherwise unrewarded . By leaving his post off Cadiz he had provoked the anger of Vice @-@ Admiral Lord Collingwood , commander in the Mediterranean ; only his victory enabled Duckworth to escape a court martial . 
 The battle of San Domingo was the last fleet engagement of the war between French and British capital ships in open water . The Royal Navy 's dominance off every French port made the risks involved in putting to sea insurmountable . The only subsequent breakout attempt , by the Brest fleet in 1809 , ended with the defeat of the French fleet close to its own anchorage at the Battle of the Basque Roads . 
 = = Background = = 
 In late 1805 , First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Barham withdrew the Royal Navy blockade of the French Atlantic ports following the Trafalgar Campaign , in which the French Navy had lost 14 ships of the line . Barham believed that the French , having suffered such heavy losses , would be unable and unwilling to launch a major offensive in the Atlantic until after the winter . However , he had miscalculated the strength of the fleet at Brest , the principal French Atlantic seaport . The Brest fleet had not been engaged in the 1805 campaign and was therefore intact . 
 Taking advantage of the withdrawal of the British blockade , Emperor Napoleon ordered two squadrons to put to sea with orders to raid the British trade routes that crossed the Atlantic . These forces were to inflict as much economic damage to Britain as possible without engaging an equivalent British naval squadron and risking defeat and capture . The cruise was expected to last as long as 14 months , sustained by captured food supplies from British merchant ships . Sailing unopposed on 13 December 1805 , the squadrons separated two days later in pursuit of British merchant convoys , one squadron steering for the South Atlantic under Contre @-@ Admiral Jean @-@ Baptiste Willaumez and the other , under Vice @-@ Admiral Corentin @-@ Urbain Leissègues , sailing for the Caribbean . The Admiralty in London did not discover that the French had sailed until 24 December , and the two squadrons they prepared in pursuit , under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and Rear @-@ Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren , did not sail until January 1806 , by which time the French had disappeared into the Atlantic . 
 There was however one British squadron that had maintained contact with the French : since the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805 , the Admiralty had stationed a squadron under Vice @-@ Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth off Cadiz to watch the remnants of the combined fleet . In November 1805 , reports reached Duckworth of a French squadron operating against British convoys off the Savage Islands between Madeira and the Canary Islands . This squadron , which belonged to Contre @-@ Admiral Zacharie Allemand , had left France in July 1805 . Immediately sailing to investigate , Duckworth abandoned Cadiz , leaving just two frigates to watch the Allied fleet at anchor . Passing the Savage and Canary Islands , Duckworth continued to the Cape Verde Islands before conceding that the French had escaped him and turning northwards again . Allemand was already far to the north . He eventually returned to France without incident on 23 December . 
 = = = Duckworth 's cruise = = = 
 During his return journey to Cadiz , on 23 December Duckworth encountered HMS Arethusa under Captain Charles Brisbane escorting a small group of merchant ships . Leissègues had intercepted , chased and dispersed Brisbane 's convoy in the Bay of Biscay on 15 December , Brisbane retaining only the largest merchant ships to help cover the flight of the smaller vessels . Once he had escaped Leissègues ' pursuit , Brisbane sailed in search of support at Cadiz , continuing southwards after realizing that Duckworth was not at his appointed station . Immediately setting a course that he believed would intercept Leissègues , Duckworth turned to the northwest and on 25 December discovered an enemy squadron approximately 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) northwest of the Canary Islands . Duckworth ordered his squadron to pursue , the chase lasting throughout the day and continuing into 26 December , by which time it had become clear that his quarry was not Allemand . In fact , Duckworth had discovered Willaumez 's squadron . However , the French admiral ordered his ships to run before Duckworth rather than give battle . By 13 : 00 on 26 December , it seemed certain that the British flagship , HMS Superb , would outstrip the rearmost French ship , when Duckworth suddenly called off the pursuit . He later claimed that he was concerned that the leading ships of his squadron would be overwhelmed by the concentrated French squadron before the stragglers , some of which were more than 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ) behind Superb , could join the battle . 
 As Willaumez escaped into the South Atlantic , Duckworth ordered his squadron to sail for Barbados to resupply before making the long journey back to Cadiz . When he arrived on 12 January 1806 , he ordered the frigate HMS Acasta to St. Kitts to arrange the required water supplies , and moved the squadron to an anchorage off Basseterre on 19 January . There two ships of the Leeward Islands squadron , HMS Northumberland and HMS Atlas , joined him . Northumberland was the flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral Alexander Cochrane , commander of the station . Cochrane 's arrival raised the number of admirals in the squadron to three , as Duckworth 's second in command was Rear @-@ Admiral Thomas Louis in HMS Canopus . Leissègues was also en route to the Caribbean , winter storms off the Azores having delayed him , separated Alexandre and Brave and inflicted damage on Jupiter and Diomède . Arriving at the French @-@ held city of Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola on 20 January , Leissègues disembarked over 1 @,@ 000 soldiers as reinforcements for the garrison , and made hasty repairs as he awaited the arrival of his missing ships , which appeared on 29 January . During his time in the harbour , Leissègues moved ashore and gave orders for the ships to be recaulked following their Atlantic voyage , a difficult and time @-@ consuming process . 
 On 1 February the small sloop HMS Kingfisher arrived at Basseterre with information that three French ships of the line had been sighted off Santo Domingo . Duckworth gave orders for the fleet to sail immediately . On 3 February the brig HMS Epervier joined him at St. Thomas and on 5 February the frigate HMS Magicienne under Captain Adam Mackenzie joined near the Mona Passage . Mackenzie was accompanied by a Danish schooner that had sailed from Santo Domingo a few days before , and whose crew were able to provide a detailed account of the French squadron 's composition . Before the schooner had sailed , a number of French officers had commented on the risk involved in allowing the vessel to leave port , but the admiral had refused their demands that he burn the Danish ship . Duckworth was now confident that he outnumbered and outgunned Leissègues . During the night of 5 February the British squadron slowly approached Santo Domingo , Acasta and Magicienne scouting ahead of the main fleet .

 = = = Duckworth 's attack = = = 
 At 06 : 00 on 6 February Duckworth 's scouts sighted the French , observing two frigates , five ships of the line and one large merchant ship anchored in line at the entrance to Santo Domingo . Leissègues had reportedly issued orders for the squadron to sail for Jamaica , even though several of the French ships were not yet ready for sea , and two frigates were already under sail when the British arrived . Leissègues was not aboard Impérial ; he and a number of his officers were still conducting their business in the town and were therefore forced to join the squadron in small boats , which delayed the squadron . Several officers , possibly including Leissègues , did not reach their ships until after the engagement had begun . Recognising that his enemy was in a vulnerable position , Duckworth raised all sail in an effort to close with the French . Leissègues too recognised the danger his ships were in and ordered them to raise anchor and then to sail westwards along the coast in the direction of Nizao . [ Note A ] Maintaining close formation , the French formed a line of battle , Captain Pierre @-@ Elie Garreau in Alexandre leading , with Impérial , Diomède , Jupiter and Brave following . The frigates and corvette took a position between the battle line and the shore . Duckworth was concerned that there might be other French forces to the west . He therefore angled his line of attack to pass across the front of the French line and signaled to his squadron to direct their fire at the front three ships : Alexandre , Impérial and Diomède . 
 At 08 : 00 Duckworth 's ships divided into two divisions , a westerly line to windward under Duckworth with Superb , Northumberland , HMS Spencer and HMS Agamemnon , and an eastern line under Louis with Canopus , HMS Donegal and Atlas . The British frigates were gathered in formation to the west of the British lines , awaiting orders to assist if required . Over the next two hours the British slowly closed with the French squadron , the British divisions breaking up as the faster ships outpaced the slower . Louis ' squadron fell behind Duckworth 's , while Agamemnon dropped behind the other three vessels in her division , which otherwise remained in a tight formation . A slight shift in the wind allowed Leissègues to adjust his direction to the southwest , but the close presence of the land restricted French movements and at 10 : 10 Superb was able to open fire on Alexandre . 
 With the British flagship engaged with the leading French vessel , Northumberland opened fire on the next in line , Leissègues ' flagship Impérial . The French ship carried 120 guns to Northumberland 's 74 , but Cochrane engaged closely , rapidly supported by Spencer , which opened fire on Impérial and Diomède simultaneously . For 15 minutes the British continued to close , both squadrons sailing westwards along the coast with the wind . At 10 : 25 , the damaged Alexandre suddenly swung out of the line in an attempt to drive between Spencer and Northumberland and rake them both . Captain Robert Stopford on Spencer responded rapidly , turning across Alexandre 's bow and raking her , before pulling along the opposite side of Garreau 's Alexandre and opening fire from close range . In the smoke and confusion neither Superb nor Northumberland noticed Spencer 's move ; both fired several shots into Spencer before they realized their mistake . With Spencer and Alexandre out of the way , Impérial was able to engage both of the leading British ships , threatening to overwhelm them . Cochrane moved to defend the flagship by pulling Northumberland between Impérial and Superb , suffering terrible damage but preserving Duckworth 's ship intact . Impérial 's fire was so heavy that several shot passed straight through Northumberland into Superb . 
 = = = Destruction of the French rear = = = 
 As the combat raged at the head of the line , the remainder of both squadrons strained to join the battle . The British eastern division under Louis reached the battling Alexandre and Spencer at 10 : 35 , the two ships locked together to the south of the main engagement . As they passed , Canopus , Donegal and Atlas all raked the French ship , bringing down all of her masts and leaving her in a crippled state . Canopus then steered directly towards the battle around Impérial , as Donegal and Atlas turned northwest to intercept Brave and Jupiter respectively . At 11 : 00 , Spencer followed Canopus while Alexandre 's crew were preoccupied with extinguishing a fire that had broken out on board . Alexandre was so badly damaged that she was unable to either escape or continue the action ; she formally surrendered ten minutes later . 
 Captain Pulteney Malcolm on Donegal attacked Brave directly , firing his starboard guns and then crossing Brave 's stern , inflicting severe damage with a raking broadside , before pulling alongside again and engaging from close range . Badly damaged , Brave surrendered . Malcolm then ordered Captain Richard Dunn in Acasta to take possession as Donegal moved forward to engage Jupiter . With Donegal alongside Jupiter , Captain Samuel Pym in Atlas abandoned his brief engagement with the French ship and steered for the melee surrounding the increasingly isolated Impérial . Taking advantage of his ship 's superior speed , Malcolm pulled ahead of Jupiter and then rammed her bow , securing the ships together to prevent the French vessel from escaping . Recognising that further resistance was hopeless , Captain Gaspard <unk> surrendered immediately . Malcolm then sent 100 men on board as a prize crew and attached a towline to the French ship , just as the trailing Agamemnon finally reached the battle . 
 = = = Leissègues drives ashore = = = 
 Under the shroud of heavy smoke that confused the positions and identities of the ships at the head of the line , manoeuvering became hazardous : Atlas fired two broadsides into Impérial as she arrived and then raked the French flagship before her tiller jammed just as Diomède loomed out the smoke . Receiving a heavy broadside from the French ship , Atlas subsequently collided with Canopus as she too appeared immediately ahead , tearing off her bowsprit in the collision . Turning back into the battle , Atlas engaged Diomède at close range as the rest of the British squadron concentrated their fire on the beleaguered Impérial , with the exception of the damaged Northumberland , which was drifting out of the line . 
 With his main and mizzen masts collapsed and escape impossible , Leissègues turned his ship towards the shore at 11 : 30 , outdistancing the fire from the drifting Northumberland and leaving Superb behind , Duckworth reluctant to risk his ship in the shallow coastal shoals . Canopus maintained the pressure , pursuing the French flagship until it was clear at 11 : 40 that Impérial was hard aground on a coral reef , less than a mile from the beach . Diomède , under attack by Atlas and the recently returned Spencer , followed Impérial ashore . As they struck the reef , both French ships lost their remaining masts and suffered severe damage to their hulls . Their crews then gathered on deck and made preparations to abandon ship as the British squadron pulled back out of range of fire from the shore . During the engagement the French frigates and corvette had all slipped between the battling squadrons and the shoreline and escaped to the westwards . The British frigates were too preoccupied with boarding and towing prizes to initiate a chase . 
 = = = Destruction of Impérial and Diomède = = = 
 As Duckworth gathered his squadron , Northumberland 's mainmast collapsed across the deck , causing severe damage to the ship 's fittings . Although Cochrane 's flagship was the most severely damaged of the squadron , all had suffered to a degree : Superb 's men counted 60 shot holes while Atlas was out of control and Donegal had lost one of her topmasts . Casualties were also distributed throughout the fleet , with Northumberland and Spencer suffering the worst and Atlas the least except for the barely engaged Agamemnon . Total losses were 74 killed and 264 wounded and several ships were damaged , but Duckworth was rapidly able to effect repairs as his ships remained on station to observe the situation ashore . 
 Impérial and Diomède had both run aground between Nizao and Point Catalan , their hulls broadside to the beach and their bottoms stove in by the reefs that lay offshore . Using the remaining ship 's boats and with assistance from the shore , the wounded and survivors were ferried to the beach . These operations continued uninterrupted until 8 February , when Duckworth sent boats from Acasta and Magicienne to the wrecks . Boarding unopposed , the boat parties removed the remaining French crewmen as prisoners and set both ships on fire to deny their potential use to the French , although Leissègues had in fact already issued orders for them to be burnt once the last men had been evacuated . Her captain , Jean @-@ Baptiste Henry , was among the 150 prisoners the British took from Diomède . By contrast , the British found only six men still aboard Impérial , none of them officers . French casualties in the engagement were very heavy , with over 500 men estimated to have been killed or wounded on Impérial alone and over 1 @,@ 000 additional casualties shared among the rest of the fleet . Jupiter had not been severely damaged in the engagement and Brave , although damaged in the hull , was in a sailing condition . Both ships had surrendered early in the engagement after losing their captains killed or wounded , in the initial exchanges . Alexandre , by contrast , was a shattered wreck . Her British prize crew only just prevented the gaping holes smashed in her hull from sinking her . 
 Duckworth remained at anchor off Santo Domingo for several more days until his entire squadron and their prizes were ready for the voyage to Jamaica , sending Commander Nathaniel Day Cochrane to Britain in Kingfisher with the official despatches . Admiral Cochrane separated from the fleet on the day of departure and Northumberland and Agamemnon sailed for Barbados in case other French forces should appear in the Leeward Islands while the main fleet was repairing at Jamaica . Duckworth was received at Jamaica with " rapturous acknowledgments " and his prizes were refitted for the journey back to Britain . In the event , Brave foundered off the Azores with the loss of three men , and Alexandre was too badly damaged for further service , being broken up on arrival . Only Jupiter , renamed HMS Maida after the recent French defeat at the battle of Maida in Italy , had any continued career in the Royal Navy . The only surviving French ships , the frigates Comète and Félicité , and the corvette Diligente all returned to France without incident over the following months . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The victory , just four months after the success at Trafalgar , was celebrated in Britain and across the Empire , particularly in the Caribbean . Mere rumours of Leissègues ' presence had stifled trade and caused panic among the merchant houses of the West Indies and Duckworth 's victory helped to restore confidence in commercial ocean travel once more . In Britain both the House of Commons and the House of Lords voted their thanks to the entire squadron when Duckworth 's account of the action was read out , the motions led by Lord Grenville and Charles Grey , who both made expansive speeches in praise of Duckworth . Head money , a bounty on enemy servicemen killed , wounded or captured , was paid for 4 @,@ 268 men , even though records showed that the French fleet carried significantly fewer men than that . Additional prize money was paid for the captured Jupiter and awards of money , ceremonial plate and ornate swords were made by patriotic societies and Lloyd 's of London insurers . Admiral Louis was made a baronet and Cochrane a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath , while a number of promotions were distributed among the first lieutenants . Duckworth , however , received nothing beyond his share of the general rewards . Vice @-@ Admiral Lord Collingwood , commander in chief of the Mediterranean , was furious that Duckworth had deserted his post off Cadiz , failed to bring Willaumez to battle in December and then sailed for the West Indies to resupply rather than returning to the Spanish coast . Historians William James and William Laird Clowes both considered that if Duckworth had not defeated Leissègues he would probably have faced a court martial . Duckworth 's absence forced Collingwood to divert some of his own ships to the Cadiz blockade . The force provided still proved inadequate – on 26 February a French frigate squadron broke out of the port and escaped to Rochefort . Collingwood 's influence was enough to block additional rewards to Duckworth , who subsequently returned to the Mediterranean and in 1807 commanded the fleet at the ineffectual Dardanelles Operation . Over four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal , awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847 . 
 In France , the government press misrepresented the battle . Le Moniteur Universel published a report purportedly written by Captain Raymond <unk> of the corvette Diligente . The report began by inaccurately claiming that the British squadron consisted of nine ships of the line . The report concluded with the information that two British ships had been destroyed on the San Domingo coast alongside three French and that two others had been dismasted and were badly damaged . The official French report , written by Leissègues but not published in France , contradicted this version of events . Leissègues stated that <unk> , with the other smaller warships , had made all sail to the westwards at the start of the engagement and that by the time the flagship drove ashore , Diligente was already out of sight . Leissègues remained on Santo Domingo for some time , but had returned to Europe by the time the colony fell to a joint English and Spanish force in July 1809 . He later received a regional command in the Ionian Sea and took part in the Adriatic campaign . 
 The Atlantic campaign continued throughout the spring and summer . Willaumez was able to avoid the British squadrons searching for him by remaining deep in the South Atlantic . However , on 13 March 1806 the British under Warren intercepted and defeated an unrelated French squadron under Contre @-@ Admiral Charles @-@ Alexandre Durand Linois while he was returning from the Indian Ocean . Eventually forced north in search of additional food supplies , Willaumez entered the Caribbean , where he hoped to intercept the Jamaica convoy to Britain . The disobedience of one of his own captains foiled Willaumez 's plan and he ordered his squadron to its final cruising ground , off Newfoundland . On 18 August 1806 , while it was deep in the Central Atlantic , a ferocious hurricane caught the squadron and scattered it . Willaumez eventually found shelter in Havana ; a number of his ships reached ports in the United States , some too badly damaged to ever sail again . Only four of the 11 ships of the line that left Brest in December 1805 ever returned to France . San Domingo was the last fleet battle of the Wars to be fought in open water ; the only subsequent engagement between fleets was the Battle of Basque Roads , fought in the narrow , shallow waters at the mouth of the Charente River .

 Ryan Wayne White ( December 6 , 1971 – April 8 , 1990 ) was an American teenager from Kokomo , Indiana , who became a national poster child for HIV / AIDS in the United States after being expelled from middle school because of his infection . As a hemophiliac , he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment and , when diagnosed in December 1984 , was given six months to live . Doctors said he posed no risk to other students , but AIDS was poorly understood at the time . When White tried to return to school , many parents and teachers in Kokomo rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer . Western School was actually located in <unk> outside of Kokomo and was not part of the local Kokomo school system . A lengthy legal battle with the school system ensued , and news of the court case turned White into a popular celebrity and advocate for AIDS research and public education . Surprising his doctors , White lived five years longer than predicted but died in April 1990 , one month before his high school graduation . 
 Before White , AIDS was a disease widely associated with the male gay community , because it was first diagnosed among gay men . That perception shifted as White and other prominent HIV @-@ infected people such as Magic Johnson , Arthur Ashe , the Ray brothers , and Kimberly <unk> appeared in the media to advocate for more AIDS research and public education to address the epidemic . The U.S. Congress passed a major piece of AIDS legislation , the Ryan White CARE Act , shortly after White 's death . The Act has been reauthorized twice ; Ryan White Programs are the largest provider of services for people living with HIV / AIDS in the United States . 
 = = Early life and illness = = 
 Ryan White was born at St. Joseph Memorial Hospital in Kokomo , Indiana , to Jeanne Elaine Hale and Hubert Wayne White . When he was circumcised , the bleeding would not stop . When he was three days old , doctors diagnosed him with severe hemophilia A , a hereditary blood coagulation disorder associated with the X chromosome , which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding . For treatment , he received weekly transfusions of Factor VIII , a blood product created from pooled plasma of non @-@ hemophiliacs , an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time . 
 Healthy for most of his childhood , he became extremely ill with pneumonia in December 1984 . On December 17 , 1984 , during a partial @-@ lung removal procedure , White was diagnosed with AIDS . The scientific community knew little about AIDS at the time : scientists had only realized earlier that year that HTLV @-@ III , now called HIV , was the cause of AIDS . White had apparently received a contaminated treatment of Factor VIII that was infected with HTLV @-@ III , although exactly when he was infected remains unknown to this day . At that time , because the retrovirus that causes AIDS had been recently identified , much of the pooled Factor VIII concentrate supply in hospitals was tainted because doctors did not know how to test for the disease , and donors often did not know they were infected or that blood was a factor in the transmission of the virus . Among hemophiliacs treated with blood @-@ clotting factors between 1979 and 1984 , nearly 90 % became infected with HIV . At the time of his diagnosis , his T @-@ cell count had dropped to 25 ( a healthy individual without HIV will have around 500 – 1200 ) . Doctors predicted White had only six months to live . 
 After the diagnosis , White was too ill to return to school , but by early 1985 he began to feel better . His mother asked if he could return to school , but was told by school officials that he could not . On June 30 , 1985 , a formal request to permit re @-@ admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith , sparking a legal battle that lasted for eight months . 
 = = Battle with schools = = 
 Western Middle School in <unk> faced enormous pressure from many parents and faculty to ban White from the campus after his diagnosis became widely known . 117 parents ( from a school of 360 total students ) and 50 teachers signed a petition encouraging school leaders to ban White from school . Due to the widespread fear and ignorance of AIDS , the principal and later the school board succumbed to this pressure and banned White . The White family filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban . The Whites initially filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis . The court , however , declined to hear the case until administrative appeals had been resolved . On November 25 , an Indiana Department of Education officer ruled that the school must follow the Indiana Board of Health guidelines and that White must be allowed to attend school . 
 The ways in which HIV spread were not fully understood in the 1980s . Scientists knew it spread via blood and was not <unk> by any sort of casual contact , but as recently as 1983 , the American Medical Association had thought that " Evidence <unk> Household Contact May <unk> AIDS " , and the belief that the disease could easily spread persisted . Children with AIDS were still rare : at the time of White 's rejection from school , the Centers for Disease Control knew of only 148 cases of pediatric AIDS in the United States . Many families in Kokomo believed his presence posed an unacceptable risk . When White was permitted to return to school for one day in February 1986 , 151 of 360 students stayed home . He also worked as a paperboy , and many of the people on his route canceled their subscriptions , believing that HIV could be transmitted through newsprint . 
 The Indiana state health commissioner , Dr. Woodrow Myers , who had extensive experience treating AIDS patients in San Francisco , and the Centers for Disease Control both notified the board that White posed no risk to other students , but the school board and many parents ignored their statements . In February 1986 , the New England Journal of Medicine published a study of 101 people who had spent three months living in close but non @-@ sexual contact with people with AIDS . The study concluded that the risk of infection was " minimal to nonexistent , " even when contact included sharing toothbrushes , razors , clothing , combs and drinking glasses ; sleeping in the same bed ; and hugging and kissing . 
 When White was finally readmitted in April , a group of families withdrew their children and started an alternative school . Threats of violence and lawsuits persisted . According to White 's mother , people on the street would often yell , " we know you 're queer " at Ryan . The editors and publishers of the Kokomo Tribune , which supported White both editorially and financially , were also ridiculed by members of the community and threatened with death for their actions . 
 White attended Western Middle School for eighth grade for the entire 1986 – 87 school year , but was deeply unhappy and had few friends . The school required him to eat with disposable utensils , use separate bathrooms , and waived his requirement to enroll in a gym class . Threats continued . When a bullet was fired through the Whites ' living room window ( no one was home at the time ) , the family decided to leave Kokomo . After finishing the school year , his family moved to Cicero , Indiana , where White enrolled at Hamilton Heights High School , located in Arcadia , Indiana . On August 31 , 1987 , a " very nervous " White was greeted by school principal Tony Cook , school system superintendent Bob G. Carnal , and a handful of students who had been educated about AIDS and were unafraid to shake White 's hand .

 The publicity of White 's trial catapulted him into the national spotlight , amidst a growing wave of AIDS coverage in the news media . Between 1985 and 1987 , the number of news stories about AIDS in the American media doubled . While isolated in middle school , White appeared frequently on national television and in newspapers to discuss his tribulations with the disease . Eventually he became known as a poster child for the AIDS crisis , appearing in fundraising and educational campaigns for the syndrome . White participated in numerous public benefits for children with AIDS . Many celebrities appeared with White , starting during his trial and continuing for the rest of his life , to help publicly <unk> socializing with people with AIDS . Singers John Cougar Mellencamp , Elton John and Michael Jackson , actor Matt <unk> , diver Greg <unk> , President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan , Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop , businessman Donald Trump ( who also paid for White 's medical expenses ) , Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight and basketball player Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar all befriended White . He also was a friend to many children with AIDS or other potentially debilitating conditions . 
 For the rest of his life he appeared frequently on Phil Donahue 's talk show . His celebrity crush , Alyssa Milano of the then @-@ popular TV show Who 's the Boss ? , met White and gave him a friendship bracelet and a kiss . Elton John loaned Jeanne White $ 16 @,@ 500 to put toward a down payment on the Cicero home , and rather than accept repayment , placed the repaid money into a college fund for Ryan 's sister . In high school White drove a red Mustang convertible , a gift from Michael Jackson . Despite the fame and donations , White stated that he disliked the public spotlight , loathed remarks that seemingly blamed his mother or his upbringing for his illness , and emphasized that he would be willing at any moment to trade his fame for freedom from the disease . 
 In 1988 , White spoke before the President 's Commission on the HIV Epidemic . White told the commission of the discrimination he had faced when he first tried to return to school , but how education about the disease had made him welcome in the town of Cicero . White emphasized his differing experiences in Kokomo and Cicero as an example of the power and importance of AIDS education . 
 In 1989 , ABC aired the television movie The Ryan White Story , starring Lukas Haas as Ryan , Judith Light as Jeanne and Nikki Cox as his sister Andrea . White had a small cameo appearance in the film , playing a boy also suffering from HIV who befriends Haas . Others in the film included Sarah Jessica Parker as a sympathetic nurse , George Dzundza as his doctor , and George C. Scott as White 's attorney , who legally argued against school board authorities . Nielsen estimated that the movie was seen by 15 million viewers . Some residents of Kokomo felt that the movie portrayed their entire town in an unfairly negative light . After the film aired , the office of Kokomo mayor Robert F. Sargent was flooded with complaints from across the country , although Sargent had not been elected to the office during the time of the controversy . 
 By early 1990 , White 's health was deteriorating rapidly . In his final public appearance , he hosted an after @-@ Oscars party with former president Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan in California . Although his health was deteriorating , White spoke to the Reagans about his date to the prom and his hopes of attending college . 
 = = Death = = 
 On March 29 , 1990 , White entered Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis with a respiratory infection . As his condition deteriorated , he was placed on a ventilator and sedated . He was visited by Elton John and the hospital was deluged with calls from well @-@ wishers . White died on April 8 , 1990 . 
 Over 1 @,@ 500 people attended White 's funeral on April 11 , a standing @-@ room only event held at the Second Presbyterian Church on Meridian Street in Indianapolis . White 's pallbearers included Elton John , football star Howie Long and Phil Donahue . Elton John performed " Skyline Pigeon " at the funeral . The funeral was also attended by Michael Jackson and First Lady Barbara Bush . On the day of the funeral , former President Ronald Reagan wrote a tribute to White that appeared in The Washington Post . Reagan 's statement about AIDS and White 's funeral were seen as indicators of how greatly White had helped change perceptions of AIDS . 
 White is buried in Cicero , close to the home of his mother . In the year following his death , his grave was vandalized on four occasions . As time passed , White 's grave became a shrine for his admirers .

 White was one of a handful of highly visible people with AIDS in the 1980s and early 1990s who helped change the public perception of the disease . White , along with actor Rock Hudson , was one of the earliest public faces of AIDS . Along with later public figures who became associated with HIV / AIDS , such as the Ray brothers , Magic Johnson , Arthur Ashe , The Brady Bunch 's Robert Reed , Tim Richmond , Kimberly <unk> , Elizabeth Glaser , Liberace and Freddie Mercury , White helped to increase public awareness that HIV / AIDS was a significant epidemic . 
 Numerous charities formed around White 's death . The Indiana University Dance Marathon , started in 1991 , raises money for the Riley Hospital for Children . Between 1991 and 2013 , this event helped raise over $ 16 million for children at Riley . The money raised has also helped found the Ryan White Infectious Disease Clinic at the hospital to take care of the nation 's sickest children . White 's personal physician , with whom he was close friends , Dr. Martin Kleiman , became the Ryan White Professor of Pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis . In a 1993 interview , prominent gay rights and AIDS activist Larry Kramer said , " I think little Ryan White probably did more to change the face of this illness and to move people than anyone . And he continues to be a presence through his mom , Jeanne White . She has an incredibly moving presence as she speaks around the world . " 
 In 1992 , White 's mother founded the national nonprofit Ryan White Foundation . The foundation worked to increase awareness of HIV / AIDS @-@ related issues , with a focus on hemophiliacs like Ryan White , and on families caring for relatives with the disease . The foundation was active throughout the 1990s , with donations reaching $ 300 @,@ 000 a year in 1997 . Between 1997 and 2000 , however , AIDS donations declined nationwide by 21 % , and the Ryan White Foundation saw its donation level drop to $ 100 @,@ 000 a year . In 2000 , White 's mother closed the foundation , and merged its remaining assets with AIDS Action , a larger charity . She became a spokeswoman for AIDS activism and continues to arrange speaking events through the site devoted to her son , <unk> White 's high school , Hamilton Heights , has had a student @-@ government sponsored annual Aids Walk , with proceeds going to a Ryan White Scholarship Fund . 
 White 's death inspired Elton John to create the Elton John AIDS Foundation . White also became the inspiration for a handful of popular songs . Elton John donated proceeds from " The Last Song , " which appears on his album The One , to a Ryan White fund at Riley Hospital . Michael Jackson dedicated the song " Gone Too Soon " from his Dangerous album to White , as did 1980s pop star Tiffany with the song " Here in My Heart " on her New Inside album . In November 2007 , The Children 's Museum of Indianapolis opened an exhibit called " The Power of Children : Making a Difference , " which remains a sobering , featured exhibit and continues to develop , while it features White 's bedroom and belongings alongside similar tributes to Anne Frank and Ruby Bridges .

 In the early 1980s , AIDS was known as gay @-@ related immune deficiency , because the disease had first been identified among primarily homosexual communities in New York City and San Francisco . At the start of the HIV / AIDS epidemic in the United States , the disease was thought to be a " homosexual problem " and was largely ignored by policy makers . White 's diagnosis demonstrated to many that AIDS was not exclusive to LGBT , minority , and poor people . In his advocacy for AIDS research , White always rejected any criticism of homosexuality , although not gay himself . 
 White was seen by some as an " innocent victim " of the AIDS epidemic . White and his family strongly rejected the language of " innocent victim " because the phrase was often used to imply that gays with AIDS were " guilty " . White 's mother told The New York Times , 
 Ryan always said , ' I 'm just like everyone else with AIDS , no matter how I got it . ' And he would never have lived as long as he did without the gay community . The people we knew in New York made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in Indiana . I hear mothers today say they 're not gonna work with no gay community on anything . Well , if it comes to your son 's life , you better start changing your heart and your attitude around .

 In August 1990 , four months after White 's death , Congress enacted The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency ( CARE ) Act ( often known simply as the Ryan White CARE Act ) , in his honor . The act is the United States ' largest federally funded program for people living with HIV / AIDS . The Ryan White CARE Act funds programs to improve availability of care for low @-@ income , uninsured and under @-@ insured victims of AIDS and their families . 
 Ryan White programs are " payers of last resort , " which subsidize treatment when no other resources are available . The act was reauthorized in 1996 , 2000 , 2006 and 2009 and remains an active piece of legislation today . The program provides some level of care for around 500 @,@ 000 people a year and , in 2004 , provided funds to 2 @,@ 567 organizations . The Ryan White programs also provide funding and technical assistance to local and state primary medical care providers , support services , healthcare provider and training programs . 
 The Ryan White CARE Act was set to expire on September 30 , 2009 , although efforts began to obtain an extension to the act . The Ryan White HIV / AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 was signed on October 30 , 2009 by President Barack Obama , who announced that implementation was progressing on repeal of the ban on travel and immigration to the U.S. by individuals with HIV that had been passed by Congress .

 Public Storage is an American international self storage company headquartered in Glendale , California that is run as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) . It is the largest brand of self @-@ storage services in the US . In 2008 , it was the largest of four publicly traded storage REITs . There are more than 2 @,@ 200 Public Storage self @-@ storage locations in the US , Canada and Europe . It also owns 42 percent of an office parks subsidiary , sells packing supplies , and provides other services . As a REIT , it is owned by real estate investors , who receive more than 90 percent of the company 's profits as a return @-@ on @-@ investment . 
 Public Storage Inc. was founded in 1972 by B. Wayne Hughes and Kenneth Volk Jr . It grew to 1 @,@ 000 locations by 1989 , using funding from investors in real estate limited partnerships ( RELPs ) . The private company was re @-@ structured as a publicly traded REIT in 1995 , when Storage Equities merged with Public Storage and adopted its name . In 2006 it acquired Shurgard Storage Centers in a $ 5 @.@ 5 billion transaction . 
 The company has been criticized for mold problems at many of its facilities , poor security resulting in burglaries , and sale of insurance policies that do not pay valid claims .

 The idea for Public Storage was conceived by Southern California real estate developer B. Wayne Hughes in the early 1970s . During a trip to Texas , he observed that local real estate developers were doing well creating mini @-@ storage facilities outside of Dallas and Houston ; he brought the self @-@ storage concept back with him to California . Hughes partnered with Kenneth Volk and the two founded Public Storage in August 1972 with a $ 50 @,@ 000 initial investment , at first calling it " Private Storage Spaces Inc . " 
 The first warehouse was built in 1972 in El Cajon , California . According to Hughes , consumers thought " Private Storage " meant the storage units were not available to the public , so the name was changed to " Public Storage " to match the " PS " acronym already on documents and signs . The founders initially planned to build the storage warehouses as a temporary source of income until the land became more valuable and could be redeveloped for another use . 
 Within three months , the first location was breaking even with a 35 percent occupancy . In comparison to real estate investments in apartments or office space , the units were rented for a similar price per square foot but cost 35 to 50 percent less to build and maintain . A property management subsidiary called Public Storage Management Inc. was formed in 1973 . By 1974 , 20 locations had been built . 
 = = = Real Estate Limited Partnership financing = = = 
 Hughes disliked loans , so he financed the purchase and development of new properties primarily through real estate limited partnerships ( RELPs ) . At first , Public Storage built warehouses and sold them to independent RELPs for a development fee . The company 's own RELP , called Public Storage Partners Ltd , was formed in 1975 and closed its first deal for $ 3 million in investments two years later . Public Storage paid cash to acquire property and build a self @-@ storage facility , then used the property 's income to pay investors back and earn a portion as profit . Public Storage Inc. also earned revenues from a portion of each deal that was made . 
 Early investors earned three to four times their money back due to increasing property values in Southern California , high occupancy rates , and increasing storage rental prices . By the mid @-@ 1980s , Public Storage was raising $ 200 to $ 300 million in investments each year . The RELP format allowed Public Storage to continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the industry had halted growth because of higher interest rates on loans . In the mid @-@ 1980s , co @-@ founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes . Forbes estimated that by this time the company was worth $ 800 million . 
 Investment funding was used to build mini @-@ storage warehouses nationally beyond California , targeting the 39 largest US cities . Public Storage opened self @-@ storage locations in close proximity , so multiple construction sites could share a development office , and to justify local television advertising . Public Storage 's growth slowed in the mid @-@ 1980s as new competition increased the cost of property and slowed the increase in rental prices to consumers . Poor weather and difficult labor markets outside of California delayed development projects ; the company also made poor investments in office parks . Interest in real estate investing also diminished . 
 By the late 1980s , the company opened its 1,000th Public Storage location and the company was three times larger than its nearest competitor in the US market . By 1989 , $ 2 @.@ 7 billion had been invested from 200 @,@ 000 investors . Public Storage helped popularize the use of self @-@ storage businesses as a real estate investment vehicle and became one of the longest @-@ running RELP investment vehicles . By 1991 , Public Storage had set up more than 150 RELPs and real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) . 
 = = = Real Estate Investment Trust ( REIT ) = = = 
 According to Financial World , by 1989 the real estate limited partnership ( RELP ) market that Public Storage relied on for funding " all but vanished " . A book by Public Storage Inc. said the Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the tax benefits of RELPs and was followed by " a tough time for real estate companies . " In December 1990 , five of its partnerships were converted to Real Estate Investment Trusts ( REITs ) in December . It also began consolidating its partnerships and acquiring many of the companies in which it held an interest . 
 Storage Equities was founded by Public Storage in 1980 to purchase self @-@ storage facilities . It was one of 17 self @-@ storage REITs that Public Storage held an interest in . Between 1992 and 1995 , Storage Equities paid Public Storage $ 31 million in management and consulting fees . In 1995 , Public Storage and its subsidiaries were merged with its self @-@ storage REIT , Storage Equities Inc . , and re @-@ structured as a single REIT called Public Storage Inc . One analyst said the acquisition capitalized on conflict of interest concerns , while Hughes said the merger was set up to alleviate them . 
 In 1995 , the company spun @-@ off its box , locks , and packing and moving supplies business into the PS <unk> subsidiary ; Public Storage said this was done to avoid the risk of losing the company 's tax @-@ free REIT status if too large a portion of the company 's business is no longer related to real estate . This frustrated institutional investors that can only invest in real estate companies and could no longer invest in the new non @-@ real estate subsidiaries . By 1998 , Public Storage had $ 141 million in quarterly revenues , $ 2 billion in assets and 1 @,@ 200 facilities in 38 states . Later that year , Public Storage acquired a competing storage company called Storage Trust Realty in a $ 600 million transaction .

 Public Storage grew steadily in the early 2000s and was added to the S & P 500 in 2005 . In 2006 it acquired Shurgard Storage Centers in a transaction totaling $ 5 @.@ 5 billion , acquiring 624 locations , including 141 in Europe . Public Storage had attempted to acquire the company in 2000 and again in 2005 , but its offers were rejected . The company has continued to make numerous acquisitions , such as a March 2010 purchase of 30 locations from A @-@ American Self Storage .
