 In 1796 British Royal Navy dominance in the East Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars was challenged by the arrival of a squadron of six French Navy frigates , commanded by Contre @-@ amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey . Among these ships was the new 40 @-@ gun frigate Preneuse , commanded by Captain Jean @-@ Matthieu @-@ Adrien Lhermitte . Preneuse had not sailed from France with Sercey , instead passing independently through the Atlantic and uniting with the squadron at Port Louis on Île de France . Sercey deployed his squadron to the Dutch East Indies , but suffered frustration at the Action of 9 September 1796 and the Bali Strait Incident of January 1797 and subsequently returned to the base at Port Louis . There the squadron began to fracture , with a succession of ships sent back to France or detached on independent missions . 
 Preneuse separated in March 1798 , carrying messages of support and 86 military volunteers for the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore , an enemy of the British in Southern India who sought to form an alliance with France . Lhermitte 's instructions emphasised subtlety in the operation , but on 20 April he attacked the British port of Tellicherry and seized the East Indiaman merchant ships <unk> and Raymond . This alerted the British to Preneuse 's mission and although the reinforcements were landed safely at Mangalore on 24 April , diplomatic relations between the British and Mysore collapsed , leading to the Fourth Anglo @-@ Mysore War the following year in which Tipu Sultan was killed and his kingdom absorbed into British India . 
 Lhermitte then sailed to rejoin Sercey and the corvette Brûle @-@ Gueule at Batavia in the Dutch East Indies for a planned junction with an allied Spanish squadron at Manila . This combined force then attacked an East India Company convoy gathering in the Pearl River in January 1799 , but in the ensuing Macau Incident they were driven off by the Royal Navy escort squadron . <unk> , Sercey returned westwards to Île de France , narrowly avoiding an unequal battle with a large British squadron blockading the port . On arrival he discovered that Preneuse and Brûle @-@ Gueule were the only ships remaining of his original command , the others having returned to France or been lost in battle . 
 = = Battle of Algoa Bay = = 
 In September 1799 Sercey dispersed his remaining ships . Brûle @-@ Gueule was sent back to France on 26 September carrying condemned political prisoners ; the corvette was eventually wrecked on the Pointe du Raz with heavy loss of life . Preneuse was ordered to operate against British trade off the coast of Southeast Africa , sailing from Port Louis on 4 August . Lhermitte focused his efforts on the Mozambique Channel and the approaches to the British Cape Colony and on 20 September encountered a squadron anchored in Algoa Bay comprising the 24 @-@ gun naval storeship HMS Camel , the 16 @-@ gun HMS Rattlesnake and the schooner Surprise , the former ships lying with their masts and rigging removed . This force was supporting an expeditionary army under General Francis Dundas fighting the Third Xhosa War . Camel was laden with military supplies but neither ship was prepared for battle , with a 30 of Camel 's sailors and 15 from Rattlesnake trapped on shore by the surf . 
 Lhermitte approached the anchored ships at 18 : 00 , flying false Danish colours , and anchored nearby . A ship 's boat from Camel approached the new arrival , rapidly realising that Preneuse was a hostile frigate and returning to their ship . Lieutenant William Fothergill , the most senior officer with the convoy , fired warning shots close to the frigate , which Lhermitte ignored . Both British ships then prepared for action . At 20 : 30 , Preneuse began to approach Rattlesnake and Fothergill opened fire immediately , joined by Camel . Lhermitte returned fire , focusing its broadside on Camel . By midnight Camel had taken several shot in the hull causing widespread flooding , and the crew ceased firing to man the pumps . Lhermitte apparently believed that Camel had abandoned the fight and he switched fire towards Rattlesnake , the engagement continuing until 03 : 30 at which point Lhermitte slipped his anchor and pulled out of range . Remaining in the bay until 10 : 00 before standing out to sea . British losses were two killed and twelve wounded , both Camel and Rattlesnake badly damaged . It was later reported in French sources that Lhermitte believed the schooner Surprise to be a well armed naval brig , prompting his withdrawal . Preneuse 's loss in the action was around 40 killed and wounded , and the frigate was reported to be badly damaged ; messages to this effect were hastily sent to the commander at the Cape , Captain George Losack who sent the 50 @-@ gun HMS Jupiter in pursuit . 
 On 9 October after spending the night with the convoy in Algoa Bay , Jupiter discovered Preneuse at 34 ° 41 ′ S 27 ° 54 ′ E and gave chase . The sea was turbulent due to a strong gale from the northwest and the chase continued into the evening before Captain William Granger was able to fire ranging shot at the French ship . Lhermitte responded with his <unk> . Granger rapidly gained on the damaged Preneuse but the state of the sea made it impossible for him to safely open his lower deck gunports and a long @-@ range duel continued at high speed throughout the night and much of the following two days . At 14 : 00 on 10 October Granger was finally close enough to bring Lhermitte to action , but found that with his 24 @-@ pounder guns unusable he was restricted to his upper deck 12 @-@ pounder guns , which were no match for Lhermitte 's main battery . As a result , the rigging on Jupiter was rapidly shot away and the British ship fell back for urgent repairs and Preneuse was able to take the opportunity to escape . Granger returned to Table Bay on 16 October . 
 = = Chase off Port Louis = = 
 Lhermitte had little subsequent success , and Preneuse returned to Port Louis in early December 1799 . The entrance to the port was blockaded by the 74 @-@ gun ship of the line HMS Tremendous under Captain John Osborn and the 50 @-@ gun HMS Adamant under Captain William Hotham . These ships had been sent specifically to intercept Preneuse , arriving at Port Louis on 7 December and successfully intercepting the merchant French vessels Benjamin and <unk> and the Spanish Nuestra Señora del Carmen . Four days later they sighted the approaching frigate and chased it northeast , Adamant pressing so close that Lhermitte could not escape and was forced to drive the frigate on shore at the mouth of the Tombeau River within range of a large shore battery . 
 At 15 : 00 Lhermitte ordered the masts on Preneuse to be cut away and the frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant , which was carefully sailing through the coastal shoals in an effort to engage the beached French ship . For more than two hours Hotham 's ship worked its way inshore until at 17 : 30 it was well positioned to open fire , unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse . By 17 : 45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours . Preneuse had surrendered , but was likely damaged beyond repair . 
 Hotham and Osborn discussed the situation and determined to destroy the wreck to deny it to the French . To this end , three cutters were gathered and a boarding party under Lieutenant Edward Grey sent in to attack Preneuse at 20 : 00 . This party came under fire from the batteries but was able to successfully access the battered French frigate at 21 : 00 , finding that only the officers and a handful of sailors remained , the others having been given the opportunity to escape to the shore in boats rather than become prisoners of war . Among the captives was Lhermitte , who was permitted to bring his personal baggage with him before he was brought to the British squadron as a prisoner . Grey then set the wrecked ship alight before returning to Adamant , having executed his orders without losing a single man . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As Preneuse had gone ashore near Port Louis , Sercey had come to observe the engagement and therefore witnessed the destruction of the last of his squadron of 1796 . A commander without a command he subsequently took ship back to France and there retired from his commission , later returning to his family and settling on Île de France . The action temporarily left the French with no naval forces in the East Indies at all , although raiding cruises by privateers still posed a considerable threat to the British Indian Ocean trade routes . The only subsequent reinforcement to arrive in the region during the war was the frigate Chiffone was intercepted and captured at the Battle of Mahé shortly after arrival in 1801 , although substantial reinforcements did reach Île de France before the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803 . 
 Lhermitte subsequently came under criticism from historians for his failure to inflict greater damage on the light force in Algoa Bay : William James described it as " a somewhat discreditable action " . Granger was also heavily criticised for his performance in the action on 11 October : William Laird Clowes considered that " No explanation of the Jupiter 's failure can be given " , while James wrote of the action with Jupiter that " Undoubtedly it was a cause of triumph to Captain L 'Hermite and well calculated to wipe away the disgrace incurred by Preneuse at Algoa bay " . 
 = Vauxhall Bridge = 
 Vauxhall Bridge is a Grade II * listed steel and granite deck arch bridge in central London . It crosses the River Thames in a south – east north – west direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Pimlico on the north bank . Opened in 1906 , it replaced an earlier bridge , originally known as Regent Bridge but later renamed Vauxhall Bridge , built between 1809 and 1816 as part of a scheme for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames . The original bridge was itself built on the site of a former ferry . 
 The building of both bridges was problematic , with both the first and second bridges requiring several redesigns from multiple architects . The original bridge , the first iron bridge over the Thames , was built by a private company and operated as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879 . The second bridge , which took eight years to build , was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane . 
 In 1963 it was proposed to replace the bridge with a modern development containing seven floors of shops , office space , hotel rooms and leisure facilities supported above the river , but the plans were abandoned because of costs . With the exception of alterations to the road layout and the balustrade , the design and appearance of the current bridge has remained almost unchanged since 1907 . The bridge today is an important part of London 's road system and carries the A202 road across the Thames . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the early 13th century , Anglo @-@ Norman mercenary Falkes de Breauté built a manor house in the then empty marshlands of South Lambeth , across the River Thames from Westminster . In 1223 – 24 , de Breauté and others revolted against Henry III ; following a failed attempt to seize the Tower of London , de Breauté 's lands in England were forfeited and he was forced into exile in France and later Rome . The lands surrounding his Lambeth manor house continued to be known as Falkes ' Hall , later Vauxhall . 
 With the exception of housing around the New Spring Gardens ( later Vauxhall Gardens ) pleasure park , opened in around 1661 , the land at Vauxhall remained sparsely populated into the 19th century , with the nearest fixed river crossings being the bridges at Westminster , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) downstream , and Battersea , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) upstream . In 1806 a scheme was proposed by Ralph Dodd to open the south bank of the Thames for development , by building a new major road from Hyde Park Corner to Kennington and Greenwich , crossing the river upstream of the existing Westminster Bridge . The proprietors of Battersea Bridge , concerned about a potential loss of customers , petitioned Parliament against the scheme , stating that " [ Dodd ] is a well known adventurer and <unk> , and the projector of numerous undertakings upon a large scale most if not all of which have failed " , and the bill was abandoned . 
 In 1809 a new bill was presented to Parliament , and the proprietors of Battersea Bridge agreed to allow it to pass and to accept compensation . The Bill incorporated the Vauxhall Bridge Company , allowing it to raise up to £ 300 @,@ 000 ( about £ 19 @.@ 6 million in 2016 ) by means of mortgages or the sale of shares , and to keep all profits from any tolls raised . From these profits , the Vauxhall Bridge Company was obliged to compensate the proprietors of Battersea Bridge for any drop in revenue caused by the new bridge . 
 = = Old Vauxhall Bridge = = 
 Dodd submitted a scheme for a bridge at Vauxhall of 13 arches . However , soon after the 1809 Act was passed , he was dismissed by the Vauxhall Bridge Company and his design was abandoned . John Rennie was commissioned to design and build the new bridge , and a stone bridge of seven arches was approved . On 9 May 1811 , Lord Dundas laid the foundation stone of the bridge on the northern bank . 
 The Vauxhall Bridge Company ran into financial difficulties and was unable to raise more than the £ 300 @,@ 000 stipulated in the 1809 Act , and a new Act was passed in 1812 permitting the Company to build a cheaper iron bridge . Rennie submitted a new design for an iron bridge of eleven spans , costing far less than the original stone design . Rennie 's design was rejected , and instead construction began on a nine arch iron bridge designed by Samuel Bentham . Concerns were raised about the construction of the piers , and engineer James Walker was appointed to inspect the work . Walker 's report led to the design being abandoned for the second time , and Walker himself was appointed to design and build a bridge of nine 78 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) cast @-@ iron arches with stone piers , the first iron bridge to be built across the Thames . 
 On 4 June 1816 , over five years after construction began , the bridge opened , initially named Regent Bridge after George , Prince Regent , but shortly afterwards renamed Vauxhall Bridge . The developers failed to pay the agreed compensation to the owners of Battersea Bridge and were taken to court ; after a legal dispute lasting five years a judgement was made in favour of Battersea Bridge , with Vauxhall Bridge being obliged to pay £ 8 @,@ 234 ( about £ 633 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) compensation . As well as the compensation awarded by the courts to Battersea Bridge in 1821 , the 1809 Act also obliged the Vauxhall Bridge Company to pay compensation to the operators of Huntley Ferry , the Sunday ferry service to Vauxhall Gardens , with the level to be decided by " a jury of 24 honest , sufficient and indifferent men " . The bridge cost £ 175 @,@ 000 ( about £ 12 @.@ 1 million in 2016 ) to build ; with the costs of approach roads and compensation payments , the total cost came to £ 297 @,@ 000 ( about £ 20 @.@ 5 million in 2016 ) . 
 = = = Usage = = = 
 In anticipation of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs , tolls were set at relatively high rates on a sliding scale , ranging from a penny for pedestrians to 2s 6d for vehicles drawn by six horses . Exemptions were granted for mail coaches , soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns . However , the area around the bridge failed to develop as expected . In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts ( later Royal Doulton ) stoneware factory at Vauxhall , and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company , the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory 's workers . Meanwhile , the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge , discouraging housing development . Consequently , toll revenues were initially lower than expected , and the dividends paid to investors were low . 
 Usage rose considerably in 1838 when the terminus of the London and South Western Railway was built at nearby Nine Elms . Nine Elms station proved inconvenient and unpopular with travellers , and in 1848 a new railway terminus was built 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) closer to central London , at Waterloo Bridge station ( renamed " Waterloo Station " in 1886 ) , and the terminus at Nine Elms was abandoned . 
 With the closure of the rail terminus , Vauxhall Bridge 's main source of revenue was visitors to the Vauxhall Gardens pleasure park . In addition to people visiting the Gardens themselves , Vauxhall Gardens were used as a launch point for hot air balloon flights , and large crowds would gather on the bridge and surrounding streets to watch the flights . A large crowd also assembled on the bridge in September 1844 to watch Mister Barry , a clown from Astley 's Amphitheatre , sail from Vauxhall Bridge to Westminster Bridge in a <unk> towed by geese .

 Despite early setbacks and the construction nearby in the 19th century of three competing bridges ( Lambeth Bridge , Chelsea Bridge and Albert Bridge ) , the rapid urban growth of London made Vauxhall Bridge very profitable . The annual income from tolls rose from £ 4 @,@ 977 ( about £ 329 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) in its first full year of operation , to £ 62 @,@ 392 ( about £ 5 @,@ 297 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) in 1877 . In 1877 the Metropolis Toll Bridges Act was passed , allowing the Metropolitan Board of Works ( MBW ) to buy all London bridges between Hammersmith Bridge and Waterloo Bridge and free them from tolls . 
 In 1879 the bridge was bought by the MBW for £ 255 @,@ 000 ( about £ 23 @,@ 380 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) and tolls on the bridge were lifted . Inspections of the bridge by the MBW following the purchase found that the two central piers were badly eroded , exposing the timber cradles on which the piers rested . Large quantities of cement in bags were laid around the wooden cradles as an emergency measure ; however , the cement bags themselves soon washed away . The piers were removed , replaced by a single large central arch . By this time the bridge was in very poor condition , and in 1895 the London County Council ( LCC ) , which had taken over from the MBW in 1889 , sought and gained Parliamentary approval to replace the bridge . Permission was granted by Parliament to raise the projected replacement costs of £ 484 @,@ 000 ( about £ 50 @,@ 420 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) from rates across the whole of London rather than only local residents , as a new bridge was considered to be of benefit to the whole of London . 
 In August 1898 a temporary wooden bridge was moved into place alongside the existing bridge , and the demolition of the old bridge began . 
 = = New Vauxhall Bridge = = 
 Sir Alexander Binnie , the resident engineer of the London County Council ( LCC ) , submitted a design for a steel bridge , which proved unpopular . At the request of the LCC , Binnie submitted a new design for a bridge of five spans , to be built in concrete and faced with granite . 
 Work on Binnie 's design began , but was beset by problems . Leading architects condemned the design , with Arthur Beresford <unk> describing it as " a would @-@ be Gothic architectural form of great vulgarity and stupid want of meaning " , and T G Jackson describing the bridge designs as a sign of " the utter apparent indifference of those in authority to the matter of art " . Plans to build large stone abutments had to be suspended when it was found that the southern abutment would block the River Effra , which by this time had been diverted underground to serve as a storm relief sewer and which flowed into the Thames at this point . The Effra had to be rerouted to join the Thames to the north of the bridge . After the construction of the foundations and piers it was then discovered that the clay of the riverbed at this point would not be able to support the weight of a concrete bridge . With the granite piers already in place , it was decided to build a steel superstructure onto the existing piers , and a superstructure 809 feet ( 247 m ) long and 80 feet ( 24 m ) wide was designed by Binnie and Maurice Fitzmaurice and built by LCC engineers at a cost of £ 437 @,@ 000 ( about £ 42 @,@ 390 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . 
 The new bridge was eventually opened on 26 May 1906 , five years behind schedule , in a ceremony presided over by the Prince of Wales and Evan Spicer , Chairman of the LCC . Charles Wall , who had won the contract to build the superstructure of the new bridge , paid the LCC £ 50 for the temporary wooden bridge , comprising 40 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 1 @,@ 100 m3 ) of timber and 580 tons of scrap metal . 
 = = = Sculpture = = = 
 The new bridge was built to a starkly functional design , and many influential architects had complained about the lack of consultation from any architects during the design process by the engineers designing the new bridge . In 1903 , during the construction of the bridge , the LCC consulted with architect William Edward Riley regarding possible decorative elements that could be added to the bridge . Riley proposed erecting two 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) pylons topped with statues at one end of the bridge , and adding decorative sculpture to the bridge piers . The pylons were rejected on grounds of cost , but following further consultation with leading architect Richard Norman Shaw it was decided to erect monumental bronze statues above the piers , and Alfred Drury , George Frampton and Frederick Pomeroy were appointed to design appropriate statues . 
 Frampton resigned from the project through pressure of work , and Drury and Pomeroy carried out the project , each contributing four monumental statues , which were installed in late 1907 . On the upstream piers are Pomeroy 's Agriculture , Architecture , Engineering and Pottery , whilst on the downstream piers are Drury 's Science , Fine Arts , Local Government and Education . Each statue weighs approximately two tons . Despite their size , the statues are little @-@ noticed by users of the bridge as they are not visible from the bridge itself , but only from the river banks or from passing shipping .

 The new bridge soon became a major transport artery and today carries the A202 across the Thames . Originally built with tram tracks , New Vauxhall Bridge was the first in central London to carry trams . Initially it carried horse @-@ drawn trams , but shortly after the bridge 's opening it was converted to carry the electric trams of London County Council Tramways ; it continued to carry trams until the ending of tram services in 1951 . In 1968 Vauxhall Bridge and Park Lane became the first roads in London to have bus lanes ; during weekday evening rush hours , the central lane of the bridge was reserved for southbound buses only . 
 = = Millbank Bridge = = 
 During the Second World War the government was concerned that Axis bombers would target the bridge , and a temporary bridge known as Millbank Bridge was built parallel to Vauxhall Bridge , 200 yards ( 180 m ) downstream . Millbank Bridge was built of steel girders supported by wooden stakes ; however , despite its flimsy appearance it was a sturdy structure , capable of supporting tanks and other heavy military equipment . In the event , Vauxhall Bridge survived the war undamaged , and in 1948 Millbank Bridge was dismantled . Its girders were shipped to Northern Rhodesia and used to span a tributary of the Zambezi . 
 = = The Crystal Span = = 
 In 1963 the Glass Age Development Committee commissioned a design for a replacement bridge at Vauxhall , inspired by the design of the Crystal Palace , to be called the Crystal Span . The Crystal Span was to have been a seven @-@ story building supported by two piers in the river , overhanging the river banks at either end . The structure itself would have been enclosed in an air conditioned glass shell . The lowest floor would have contained two three @-@ lane carriageways for vehicles , with a layer of shops and a skating rink in the centre of the upper floors . The southern end of the upper floors was to house a luxury hotel , whilst the northern end was to house the modern art collection of the nearby Tate Gallery , which at this time was suffering from a severe shortage of display space . The roof was to have housed a series of roof gardens , observation platforms and courtyards , surrounding a large open @-@ air theatre . The entire structure would have been 970 feet ( 300 m ) long and 127 feet ( 39 m ) wide . Despite much public interest in the proposals , the London County Council was reluctant to pay the estimated £ 7 million ( £ 132 million in 2016 ) construction costs , and the scheme was abandoned . 
 = = Recent history = = 
 In 1993 , a remnant of the earliest known bridge @-@ like structure in London was discovered alongside Vauxhall Bridge , when shifting currents washed away a layer of silt which had covered it . Dating to between 1550 BC and 300 BC , it consists of two rows of wooden posts , which it is believed would originally have carried a deck of some kind . It is believed that it did not cross the whole river , but instead connected the south bank to an island , possibly used for burial of the dead . As no mention of this or similar structures in the area is made in Julius Caesar 's account of crossing the Thames nor by any other Roman author , it is presumed that the structure had been dismantled or destroyed prior to Caesar 's expedition to Britain in 55 BC . The posts are still visible at extreme low tides . 
 Following the closure of a number of the area 's industries , in the 1970s and 1980s the land at the southern end of Vauxhall Bridge remained empty , following the failures of multiple redevelopment schemes . The most notable came in 1979 when Keith Wickenden MP , owner of the land at the immediate southern end of the bridge , proposed a large @-@ scale redevelopment of the site . The development was to contain 300 @,@ 000 square feet ( 28 @,@ 000 m2 ) of office space , 100 luxury flats and a gallery to house the Tate Gallery 's modern art collection . The offices were to be housed in a 500 @-@ foot ( 150 m ) tower of green glass , which was nicknamed the " Green Giant " and met with much opposition . The then Secretary of State for the Environment , Michael Heseltine , refused permission for the development and the site remained empty . 
 In 1988 Regalian Properties purchased the site , and appointed Terry Farrell as architect . Farrell designed a self @-@ contained community of shops , housing , offices and public spaces for the site . Regalian disliked the proposals and requested Farrell design a single large office block . Despite containing 50 % more office space than the rejected Green Giant proposal , the design was accepted . The government then bought the site and design as a future headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service , and the design was accordingly modified to increase security . In 1995 the SIS Building was opened on the site , and today dominates other buildings in the vicinity of the bridge . 
 In 2004 the Vauxhall Cross area at the southern end of the bridge was redeveloped as a major transport interchange , combining a large bus station with the existing National Rail and London Underground stations at Vauxhall . Immediately to the east of the southern end of the bridge , a slipway provides access for amphibious buses between the road and river . 
 The only significant alteration to the structure of the bridge itself since the addition of the sculptures in 1907 came in 1973 , when the Greater London Council ( GLC ) decided to add an extra traffic lane by reducing the width of the pavements . To counter the increased load of extra traffic , the council announced the replacement of the cast @-@ iron balustrades with low box @-@ girder structures . Despite formal objections from both Lambeth and Westminster Councils , the GLC ignored the objections . In 2015 , the extra lane of motor traffic was removed in favour of a kerb @-@ protected two @-@ way cycle track , on the north @-@ east side of the bridge . 
 The bridge was declared a Grade II * listed structure in 2008 , providing protection to preserve its character from alteration . 
 = McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 4 Phantom II in UK service = 
 The United Kingdom operated the McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 4 Phantom II as one of its principal combat aircraft from the 1960s to the early 1990s . The UK was the first export customer for the Phantom , which was ordered in the context of political and economic difficulties around indigenous British designs for the roles that it was eventually purchased to undertake . The Phantom was procured to serve in both the Fleet Air Arm and Royal Air Force in several roles including air defence , close air support , low @-@ level strike and tactical reconnaissance . 
 Although assembled in the United States , the UK 's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing a significant amount of British technology as a means of easing the pressure on the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations . Two individual variants were eventually built for the UK ; the F @-@ 4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy 's aircraft carriers , while the F @-@ 4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles . In the mid @-@ 1980s , a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of second @-@ hand F @-@ 4J aircraft were purchased to augment the UK 's air defences following the Falklands War . 
 The Phantom entered service with both the Fleet Air Arm and the RAF in 1969 ; while in the Royal Navy it had a secondary strike role in addition to its primary use for fleet air defence , in the RAF it was soon replaced in the strike role by other aircraft designed specifically for strike and close air support missions , and by the mid @-@ 1970s was transferred to become the UK 's principal interceptor , a role in which it continued until the late 1980s . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the late 1950s , the British Government began the process of replacing its early second @-@ generation jet combat aircraft then in service with the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm . At the time , the British aerospace industry was still a major source of equipment , with designs from different companies in service in various roles . The 1957 Defence White Paper brought about a significant change in the working practices , with the Government compelling major aerospace manufacturers to amalgamate into two large groups : British Aircraft Corporation ( formed from the merger of English Electric , Vickers @-@ Armstrongs , Bristol and Hunting ) and Hawker Siddeley ( formed from the merger of Hawker Siddeley Aviation , Folland , de Havilland and Blackburn ) . 
 The intention was to rationalise the industry to cut costs , with the government also offering incentives for amalgamation through promises of contracts for new aircraft orders for the armed forces . At the time , the RAF were looking to replace the English Electric Canberra light bomber in the long @-@ range interdictor role and the Hawker Hunter in the close air support role , while the Royal Navy sought an aircraft to assume the fleet air defence role from the de Havilland Sea Vixen . BAC , through its English Electric subsidiary , had begun developing a new high @-@ performance strike aircraft , the TSR @-@ 2 , which was intended to undertake long @-@ range , low @-@ level strike missions with conventional and tactical nuclear weapons as well as to conduct tactical reconnaissance . Hawker Siddeley was also developing a new aircraft , based on its P.1127 V / STOL demonstrator . The P.1154 was proposed as a supersonic version that could be marketed to both the RAF and Royal Navy to fulfil a number of roles : close air support , air superiority and fleet air defence . 
 During the early 1960s , aircraft development became increasingly expensive , with the result that major projects often became mired in political and economic concerns . The development of TSR @-@ 2 saw increasing cost overruns , combined with the presence of a potentially cheaper alternative then under development in the United States , the F @-@ 111 . The P.1154 was subject to the ongoing inter @-@ service rivalry between the Royal Navy and RAF , which led to two wildly differing specifications being submitted for the aircraft that were impossible to fit within a single airframe . 
 In 1964 , the Royal Navy withdrew from the P.1154 project , and instead made moves to procure a new fleet air defence interceptor . It eventually selected the McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 4 Phantom II , then in service with the US Navy as its primary air defence aircraft , intended to be operated from both existing and new @-@ built aircraft carriers . This better suited the Royal Navy , as McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 4 Phantom II had two engines ( providing redundancy in the event of an engine failure ) , was cheaper than the P.1154 , and was immediately available . P.1154 was then left as a wholly RAF project . Later the same year , a General Election brought the Labour Party back into power . The new government undertook a defence review , which led to the 1966 Defence White Paper that cancelled several projects , including both the P.1154 and TSR @-@ 2 . As a consequence , the government was forced to order new aircraft to replace the Canberra and Hunter for the RAF , and eventually chose two types – to replace the Canberra in the long @-@ range role ( which was intended for TSR @-@ 2 ) , the F @-@ 111 was selected , with plans for a redesigned variant , while the roles undertaken by the Hunter ( for which P.1154 was to be procured ) would be undertaken by a further purchase of F @-@ 4 Phantoms . As the Phantom had been developed primarily for fleet air defence , the Royal Navy was happy with the choice of the aircraft as its Sea Vixen replacement , given that the type had been operational in that role with the US Navy since 1961 , whilst US aircraft had successfully undertaken touch @-@ and @-@ go landings on both HMS Hermes and HMS Victorious . The RAF was less enthusiastic , as the Phantom was primarily designed to operate in the air defence rather than the close air support role , and had been selected as its Hunter replacement more as a way of decreasing the per @-@ unit cost of the overall UK order . 
 Partly as a means of guaranteeing employment in the British aerospace industry , agreement was reached that significant amounts of the structure of the UK 's Phantoms would be built domestically . The F @-@ 4J variant , which was then the primary version in service with the US Navy , was taken as the basis for the UK aircraft , with major redesign . The most significant change was the substitution of the larger and more powerful Rolls @-@ Royce Spey turbofan for the GE J79 turbojet to allow operations from the Royal Navy 's carriers . Although several had received major upgrades , all of which were smaller than the USN carriers that J79 @-@ GE @-@ 8 and − 10 powered Phantoms operated from . To accommodate the larger engines , BAC redesigned and built the entire rear fuselage section . The Westinghouse AN / AWG @-@ 10 radar carried by the F @-@ 4J was to be procured and built under licence by Ferranti as the AN / AWG @-@ 11 for Fleet Air Arm aircraft and AN / AWG @-@ 12 for those of the RAF . The overall changes to the aircraft led to the two variants being given their own separate series letters , with the FAA version being designated as the F @-@ 4K and the RAF version as the F @-@ 4M . 
 Initially , there was an intention to procure up to 400 aircraft for the Royal Navy and the RAF , but the development cost associated with the changes specified by the UK to accommodate the Spey turbofans meant that the per @-@ unit price eventually ended up being three times the price of an F @-@ 4J ; because the government then had a policy of negotiating fixed @-@ price contracts , these costs could not be evened out by a large production run , which left the total order at 170 .

 The British Government ordered a total of four prototypes ( two F @-@ 4K and two F @-@ 4M ) , together with a pair of pre @-@ production F @-@ 4K aircraft . The first UK Phantom , a prototype F @-@ 4K ( designated as YF @-@ 4K ) , first flew on 27 June 1966 at the McDonnell Douglas plant in St. Louis . The second made its first flight on 30 August 1966 . The two pre @-@ production F @-@ 4K aircraft were constructed alongside the prototypes , and were initially used for fit check trials of the various systems they would be fitted with – the first was used for catapult / arrestor and deck landing trials , while the second was primarily for testing the radar and missile systems . All four were delivered to the UK from 1969 to 1970 for continued use in testing work by both the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment and British Aerospace . One of the pre @-@ production examples was subsequently delivered to the RAF for operational use , but was lost in 1978 . The first F @-@ 4M prototype ( designated YF @-@ 4M ) first flew on 17 February 1967 , with both again used for fit check work before delivery to the UK .

 In 1964 , a total of 140 new build Phantoms were ordered for the Fleet Air Arm to serve as the Royal Navy 's primary fleet air defence aircraft , combined with a secondary strike capability . These were procured to replace the Sea Vixen then in service in the role , with the intention that they operate from the decks of four brand new or modernised aircraft carriers . At the time , the Royal Navy 's carrier force consisted primarily of five fleet or light fleet carriers of differing sizes and ages . Of the five in service , only Eagle and Ark Royal , each displacing approximately 50 @,@ 000 tons , were big enough to accommodate the Phantom in sufficient numbers , and so plans were put in place to rebuild the two ships to enable the operation of the aircraft . 
 At the same time , plans were in place to construct two new aircraft carriers to a new design , termed as " CVA @-@ 01 " ; the requirements for the intended force of four carriers meant that up to five squadrons of Phantoms were planned to be purchased . However , in its 1966 Defence White Paper the Government decided to cancel CVA @-@ 01 ( as well as cancelling TSR @-@ 2 ) , which led to reductions in the total procurement order for the Royal Navy 's Phantoms ; initially , 143 were ordered , which then went down to 110 , and finally 50 , with options for another seven . The intention was to form a pair of front @-@ line squadrons , each of twelve aircraft , that would operate from the two remaining , heavily modernised fleet carriers , with the remainder of the fleet as a reserve and for training . 
 The Royal Navy received its first F @-@ 4K Phantoms , which received the British designation FG.1 , in April 1968 . These were assigned to <unk> Naval Air Squadron ( NAS ) , which was to serve as Intensive Flying Trials Unit . Upon completion of the successful flight trials , 767 Naval Air Squadron was commissioned in January 1969 as the FAA 's training squadron . This was followed at the end of March 1969 by 892 Naval Air Squadron , which commissioned as the Royal Navy 's first operational Phantom unit , intended to embark in Ark Royal once her three @-@ year refit had completed in 1970 . 
 At the same time as the Fleet Air Arm was receiving its first aircraft , the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its ' C ' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle . Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969 ; the first set was a set of approaches and touch and go landings , while the second set of trials involved full up catapult launch and arrested recovery . As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans , the ship 's jet blast deflectors ( <unk> ) were not used ; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch , with fire hoses needed after each launch to prevent them melting . 
 Ark Royal had entered refit to accommodate the Phantom in 1967 ; this involved a major reconstruction , with a number of elements undertaken to allow the ship to operate the aircraft – the flight deck was increased in area , and fully angled to 8 ½ ° ; the arresting gear was replaced with a new water @-@ spray system to allow for the Phantom 's higher weight and landing speed ; while bridle catchers and water @-@ cooled <unk> were fitted to the catapults . Once this work was complete , Eagle was then scheduled to undergo a similar modernization . However , in 1969 , the planned refit of Eagle was cancelled , while the options for seven additional FG.1s was not taken up . As a consequence , it was then decided to further reduce the FAA 's Phantom fleet to just 28 aircraft . The remaining 20 aircraft were then allocated to the Royal Air Force . 
 In 1970 , Ark Royal embarked 892 NAS , with a total of 12 aircraft , as part of her air group for the first time . However , the first operational use of the Royal Navy 's Phantoms had come in 1969 , when 892 NAS had embarked for training with the US aircraft carrier USS Saratoga in the Mediterranean , and had undertaken air defence missions alongside the ship 's own F @-@ 4Js . This deployment showed the necessity for the modifications fitted to Ark Royal , as the heat from the afterburners of the Spey , combined with the increased AoA resulting from the extendable nosewheel , during the initial launches from Saratoga caused the deck plates to distort , leading to subsequent catapult launches being undertaken at reduced weight without the use of re @-@ heat . During Ark Royal 's first three @-@ year commission , 892 NAS , which had initially used RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset as its home base , moved to RAF Leuchars in Fife where , during the periods when it was not embarked , it undertook Quick Reaction Alert ( QRA ) duties alongside the RAF 's 43 Squadron . The Phantom served in the Fleet Air Arm until 1978 , when Ark Royal was finally withdrawn from service , leaving no ship left in the Royal Navy capable of operating the type . The final catapult launch from Ark Royal was a Phantom of 892 NAS on 27 November 1978 during the disembarkation of the air group following the ship 's final deployment ; the squadron 's aircraft were delivered to RAF St Athan in Wales where they were then handed over to the RAF . During the type 's service with the Royal Navy , a total of 10 of the total FAA fleet of 28 were lost .

 Following the cancellation of the planned refit of HMS Eagle to allow her to operate the Phantom , a total of 20 airframes that had originally been ordered for the Fleet Air Arm were diverted to the Royal Air Force to serve in the air defence role . At the time , the RAF 's primary interceptor was the English Electric Lightning , which suffered badly both in terms of range , loiter time and weapons fit , all of which hampered its effectiveness , especially in long interceptions of Soviet Air Forces and Soviet Naval Aviation bombers and reconnaissance aircraft over the North Sea and North Atlantic . So a new Phantom squadron was formed at RAF Leuchars , the UK 's most northerly air defence base at the time , to take advantage of the improvements that the Phantom provided over the Lightning – it could carry more fuel , and could thus fly further for longer ; it was fitted with a more powerful radar ; and it could carry more missiles ( up to 8 , compared to 2 for the Lightning ) . On 1 September 1969 , 43 Squadron was formed at Leuchars , operating as part of the UK 's northern QRA zone alongside the Lightnings of 11 Squadron and , from 1972 , the Royal Navy Phantoms of 892 Naval Air Squadron . 
 Upon the withdrawal of HMS Ark Royal in 1978 , the Phantoms of the Fleet Air Arm were turned over to the RAF and used to form a second squadron at Leuchars . At the time , 111 Squadron was stationed there operating the FGR.2 version of the Phantom , having been there since 1975 . In 1979 , to save costs resulting from the differences between the FG.1 and FGR.2 , the squadron converted to the ex @-@ Navy aircraft , dispersing its existing airframes to other Phantom units . Both 43 and 111 Squadrons retained the FG.1 until 1989 , when they converted to the new Tornado <unk> Following the standing down of the two operational squadrons and the final withdrawal of the type from service , the bulk of the RAF 's FG.1 Phantoms were scrapped . The RAF lost a total of eight of their FG.1s in crashes throughout the type 's twenty year service .

 Following the cancellation of both the TSR @-@ 2 and P.1154 programmes , the RAF were still left with a requirement to replace both the Canberra and Hunter in the long @-@ range strike , close air support and reconnaissance roles . This resulted in the procurement of two aircraft , the General Dynamics F @-@ 111K , intended for the long @-@ range interdiction roles carried out by the Canberra , and the F @-@ 4M Phantom , which would be used in the close air support role undertaken by the Hunter . While the F @-@ 111K was cancelled within a year of being ordered , the order for 150 Phantoms went ahead alongside the Phantom order for the Royal Navy . However , the final 32 units of the order were eventually cancelled . The RAF Phantom , given the designation FGR.2 , was broadly similar to the naval version , with some minor variations in terms of engines , avionics and structure , which related to its use as a land @-@ based , rather than carrier @-@ based aircraft . 
 The first RAF Phantom unit was 228 Operational Conversion Unit , which was stood up in August 1968 . The Phantom entered operational service in May 1969 , when 6 Squadron was formed at RAF Coningsby in the tactical strike role . 54 Squadron was formed in September the same year , while 41 Squadron came in 1972 as a tactical reconnaissance unit . A further four squadrons were formed in RAF Germany on the Phantom in these roles , with 2 , 14 , 17 and 31 Squadrons all formed at RAF <unk> in 1970 and 1971 . 14 , 17 and 31 Squadrons were assigned , in addition to their conventional strike role , a tactical nuclear strike role under SACEUR , using weapons supplied by the United States . After initial work @-@ up , 2 Squadron moved to and operated from RAF Laarbruch in the tactical reconnaissance role . The aircraft assigned to the two tactical reconnaissance units were fitted with a recce pod containing 4 optical cameras , an infrared linescan and a sideways looking radar . 
 During the 1970s , the RAF was in the process of developing a new aircraft specifically for the tactical strike and reconnaissance missions , which eventually became the SEPECAT Jaguar . This was introduced into service in 1974 , and led to a re @-@ think in the use of the Phantom as , at the same time , the limitations of the Lightning as an interceptor were becoming more apparent . The conversion of the RAF 's FGR.2 squadrons to operate the Jaguar , combined with the use of the Blackburn Buccaneer , which had been purchased to assume some of the strike roles intended for the F @-@ 111K , meant that it was possible to begin transferring Phantoms to operate purely as interceptors in the air defence role . 
 = = = = Air defence = = = = 
 In October 1974 , 111 Squadron converted from the Lightning to the Phantom FGR.2 , becoming the first unit to operate the type in the air defence role ( notwithstanding 43 Squadron , which had used the FG.1 version since 1969 ) . As more Jaguars were delivered , enabling the strike squadrons in the UK and Germany to convert , more Phantoms were released enabling existing Lightning squadrons to be converted ; 19 Squadron and 92 Squadron , the forward deployed air defence units in Germany , converted in 1976 and 1977 respectively , at the same time moving from RAF Gütersloh , which was the closest RAF base to the East German border , to RAF Wildenrath , taking advantage of the Phantom 's superior range over the Lightning . Three further UK based squadrons , 23 , 29 and 56 , were also converted between 1974 and 1976 . 111 Squadron , which had been the first unit to use the FGR.2 as an interceptor , converted to the FG.1 version in 1979 following the transfer of the Royal Navy 's remaining airframes to the RAF . The Phantom subsequently served as the RAF 's primary interceptor for over a decade until the introduction into service of the Panavia Tornado F.3 in 1987 . 
 When Phantoms were first delivered to interceptor squadrons , they remained in the grey @-@ green camouflage colour scheme more associated with the strike and close air support missions they had undertaken . During the late 1970s , the RAF began experimenting with new colours for its air defence units , with 56 Squadron tasked with trialling proposed new schemes . In October 1978 , a Phantom FGR.2 of 56 Squadron became the first to be painted in the new air superiority grey colour , combined with small , low visibility roundels and markings . However , although the roundel remained in low visibility colours , individual squadron markings eventually returned to more observable sizes and colours . 
 In May 1982 , three Phantoms from 29 Squadron were forward deployed to RAF Wideawake on Ascension Island to provide air cover during the RAF 's operations as part of Operation Corporate , replacing Harriers of 1 Squadron , which were transiting to the war zone . In August 1982 , following the end of the conflict and the reconstruction of the runway , 29 Squadron detached a number of its aircraft to RAF Stanley to provide air defence for the Falkland Islands . Late the following year , 23 Squadron took up the role , remaining stationed there until October 1988 , when they were replaced by 1435 Flight . To make up for the loss of an entire squadron from the UK Air Defence Region , the RAF procured 15 second @-@ hand F @-@ 4J Phantoms that had previously been used by the US Navy . These aircraft were operated by 74 Squadron from 1984 until 1991 , when they were replaced by FGR.2 Phantoms that had been released by other squadrons following their conversion to the Tornado . Initially , it was intended that Phantoms and Tornados serve alongside each other ; a total of 152 Tornado <unk> were ordered for the RAF , enough to convert four squadrons of Phantoms and two of Lightnings , but insufficient to completely convert every air defence squadron ; both 23 and 29 Squadrons converted from the Phantom FGR.2 to the Tornado between 1987 and 1988 , alongside the conversion of the final two remaining Lightning squadrons ; the intention was to retain a pair of UK based Phantom squadrons at RAF Wattisham alongside a pair of Tornado units at RAF Coningsby to provide air defence cover for the southern half of the UK Air Defence Region , with another two squadrons stationed in Germany . The end of the Cold War however led to a more rapid withdrawal of Phantom units than had originally been planned ; under the Options for Change defence review the Phantom was to be withdrawn from service , with the two Germany based units disbanded as part of the gradual run down of the RAF 's presence , and a reduction in the number of air defence squadrons leading to the two UK based units being disbanded in late 1992 . However , just prior to the final withdrawal of the Phantom , it was recalled operationally as a result of Operation Granby , the UK 's participation in the First Gulf War , when a total of six aircraft from 19 and 92 Squadrons were forward deployed to provide air defence cover at RAF Akrotiri ; this was to replace the Tornados that had been originally deployed there on exercise , and were subsequently sent to the Gulf region . Following their final withdrawal from service , with a few exceptions , the bulk of the RAF 's FGR.2 fleet was scrapped . Over its service life , 37 FGR.2s were lost to crashes .

 Following the end of the Falklands War , the UK government began a programme of upgrading the defences of the Falkland Islands to guard against any further potential aggression from Argentina . One of the measures taken was the deployment of an interceptor squadron to the islands themselves , with 23 Squadron forming at RAF Stanley in October 1983 . At the time , the air defence variant of the Panavia Tornado was still in development , meaning that the Phantom was the UK 's primary air defence aircraft ( supported by two remaining squadrons of Lightnings ) . The removal of a squadron of Phantoms to the Falkland Islands left a gap in the UK 's air defences with nothing immediately available to fill it , given that the Tornado was still some years from entering service . As a consequence , the UK government decided to purchase an additional squadron of Phantoms . However , because the aircraft in service with the RAF were the special production batch built to UK specifications , it would not be possible to obtain identical aircraft . So , a total of 15 second @-@ hand airframes were procured from among the best of the ex @-@ US Navy F @-@ 4Js stored at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis – Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and the Naval Air Rework Facility at NAS North Island . The F @-@ 4J was chosen as it was the variant from which the RAF 's F @-@ 4Ks and F @-@ <unk> had been developed , and thus the closest available to the British aircraft . The 15 that were selected were extensively refurbished and brought to a standard almost equivalent to the F @-@ 4S , which was the last variant in service with the US Navy , with the only differences being the absence of leading @-@ edge slats and a helmet gun sight . 
 The major difference between the F @-@ 4J and the British Phantoms was the absence of the Rolls @-@ Royce Spey turbofan , with instead the aircraft being fitted with the GE J79 @-@ 10B , which produced less power than the British engine , but had a faster afterburner light up , giving it better performance at high altitude , at the expense of slightly poorer acceleration at low level ; the high altitude performance was helped by the reduced drag from its smaller air intakes . Initially delivered capable of carrying the Sparrow and Sidewinder air @-@ to @-@ air missiles ( AAM ) , they were soon made compatible with the Skyflash and SUU @-@ 23A gun pod , bringing them into line with the rest of the RAF 's Phantoms . However , in spite of some modifications to allow them to operate with the rest of the fleet , the F @-@ 4Js retained the vast bulk of the equipment they were originally fitted with , which even led to their crews requiring American flying helmets . 
 Although the new Phantoms were assigned a British designation as the F.3 , they were generally referred to as the F @-@ 4J ( UK ) . They were assigned to 74 Squadron at RAF Wattisham , which stood up in October 1984 , just two months after the first flight . The aircraft remained in service through the transition to the Tornado , which began entering service in 1987 . In 1990 , thanks to the conversion of F @-@ 4M squadrons to the Tornado , the RAF were able to transfer the best of its remaining FGR.2s to 74 Squadron , which meant that the F.3 was able to be withdrawn in January 1991 . With a couple of exceptions , all of the RAF 's F @-@ 4Js were broken up for scrap . One of the 15 airframes was lost in a crash in 1987 , killing both crew members .

 The Phantom FG.1 and FGR.2 as built were similar , being fitted as they were with broadly the same engines and avionics , although in both cases there were minor differences . The FGR.2 was fitted with the Mark 202 version of the Rolls @-@ Royce Spey turbofan , while the FG.1 had the Mark 203 ; this was fundamentally the same , but had a modified control system for the afterburner , which allowed it to light faster , to enable power to be applied quickly in the event of a bolter on the small decks of the Royal Navy 's aircraft carriers . Both variants were fitted with a licence built version of the Westinghouse AN / AWG @-@ 10 avionics package ; the FG.1 was fitted with the AN / AWG @-@ 11 , which differed primarily in having a nose radome that was hinged and able to fold backwards against the aircraft 's fuselage to allow for storage in the hangar of an aircraft carrier ; the system was designed to be integrated with both the AGM @-@ 12 Bullpup missile and WE.177 as required . The AN / AWG @-@ 12 fitted to the FGR.2 was not foldable , and featured a better ground mapping mode , to take into account the strike role for which the type was originally procured ; allied to this was a Ferranti inertial navigation / attack system ( removed when the type converted to the air defence role ) . It was also configured to be able to control the SUU @-@ 23A gun pod , which the Royal Navy 's FG.1s were not fitted with . 
 = = = British Phantoms and other Phantoms = = = 
 Although there were some minor differences between the two types of Phantom built for the UK , there were many significant ones between the British Phantoms and those built for the United States . The most obvious one was the substitution of the Rolls @-@ Royce Spey turbofan for the General Electric J79 turbojet . The Spey was shorter in length than the J79 , but wider in diameter , which meant that the intakes had to be redesigned for a higher airflow , making them 20 % larger ( with a consequent increase in drag ) , while the fuselage was widened by 152 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) . The position of the afterburner also meant that the rear of the fuselage had to be made deeper . In addition auxiliary intake doors were fitted on the rear fuselage . 
 Estimates on the performance of the Spey engined Phantom as opposed to its American equivalent had the aircraft requiring a 30 % shorter take @-@ off distance , 20 % faster climb to altitude , higher top speed and longer range . The Spey was certainly more efficient at lower altitudes , and had better acceleration at low speed , giving British Phantoms better range and acceleration , which was shown during the deployment of 892 NAS to the Mediterranean aboard USS Saratoga in 1969 , when the F @-@ 4K was repeatedly quicker off the deck than the F @-@ 4J used by the Americans . But , it was less efficient at higher altitudes , with British Phantoms lacking speed compared with J79 powered versions owing to the increased drag of the re @-@ designed fuselage . This discrepancy became apparent when the F @-@ 4J was obtained by the UK in 1984 ; this was regarded as being the best of the three variants to serve in the RAF . 
 The small size of the aircraft carriers Eagle and Ark Royal , from which the Royal Navy 's Phantoms were intended to operate , compared to the US Navy carriers of the period , meant that the F @-@ 4K version required significant structural changes compared to the F @-@ 4J , from which it was descended , and which performed a similar role . In addition to the folding nose radome to allow for storage in the smaller hangars of the British ships , it had to have a significantly strengthened undercarriage to account for the higher landing weight ( British policy was to bring back unused ordnance ) ; a telescopic nosewheel oleo that extended by 40 inches ( 100 cm ) to provide an increased take @-@ off attitude ( the extension of the nosewheel put the Phantom at a 9 ° attitude ) due to the shorter and less powerful catapults ; and drooping ailerons , enlarged leading edge flaps and a slotted tailplane , increased flap and leading edge blowing , all to improve the lift and handling characteristics of operation from the much smaller carriers of the Royal Navy . 
 As the Phantom continued in service , other changes were made , most notably the addition of the Marconi <unk> Radar Warning Receiver in an installation mounted on top of the vertical stabiliser , the only Phantom variants to be so fitted . The RWR installation was fitted in the mid @-@ 1970s to both the FG.1 and FGR.2 Phantoms , but was not fitted to the <unk> From 1978 , the Skyflash AAM , derived from the AIM @-@ 7 Sparrow , began to be delivered to RAF Phantom units , and was used concurrently with the Sparrow ; all three UK Phantom variants were eventually fitted to operate the Skyflash .

 The first batch of Phantoms produced for the UK received serials in the XT range , with a total of 44 production models ( 20 FG.1s and 24 FGR.2s ) , as well as the four prototypes and two pre @-@ production models being given XT serial numbers . The bulk of the UK 's specially built Phantoms were delivered with XV serials ( 94 FGR.2s and 28 FG.1s ) , while the two cancelled sets of airframes ( 32 FGR.2 and 7 FG.1 ) also received XV numbers . The second @-@ hand examples ( 15 F.3 ) obtained in 1984 received serials in the ZE range .

 The RAF operated the Phantom from a number of bases in the UK , Germany and the Falkland Islands during its operational service , while the Royal Navy initially based its Phantom units at its main air station at Yeovilton ; following the disbanding of the Fleet Air Arm 's dedicated training squadron , its sole operational Phantom squadron was subsequently moved to take up residence at the RAF 's base at Leuchars .

 Although the Phantom was ordered in 1966 , the variants that were eventually constructed were not the first to be offered to the UK . McDonnell Aircraft had been conducting studies into the possibility of the Royal Navy using the Phantom on its carriers since 1959 , when they had concluded on the need for more power than could be provided by the J79 turbojet in order to operate from the smaller decks of British carriers , with the company talking to Rolls @-@ Royce about whether the RB @-@ 168 Spey turbofan , then in development for use in the Blackburn Buccaneer , could be fitted to the aircraft . In 1960 , McDonnell approached the RAF with its model number <unk> , which was an F4H @-@ 1 ( later F @-@ 4B ) with various modifications , including the installation of the Rolls @-@ Royce Spey <unk> turbofan . The company continued studies , with afterburning Spey 101 engines proposed in 1962 , while trials of an F @-@ 4B fitted with an extendable nosewheel oleo took place aboard USS Forrestal in 1963 . In 1964 , the model <unk> was proposed , which was identical to the F @-@ 4D variant , but would have been fitted with the <unk> @-@ 25R version of the Spey engine . 
 = = = = RF @-@ 4M = = = = 
 A further proposal came after the order for the F @-@ 4M was being finalized , and was a result of the UK 's need for an aircraft to perform the tactical reconnaissance role . For this , McDonnell offered two options : 
 The standard F @-@ 4M fitted with a reconnaissance pod in place of the centerline fuel tank 
 A modified airframe , designated as RF @-@ 4M , with the reconnaissance equipment carried internally 
 Although the RF @-@ 4M would have had some advantages , it was discounted as the cost would have been greater , with consequently fewer aircraft purchased , while only those that had been modified would have been able to undertake the reconnaissance mission . Ultimately , the RAF chose the standard F @-@ 4M and external pod , which allowed all of its aircraft to perform all designated roles . 
 = = = = F @-@ 4 ( HL ) = = = = 
 Another idea that McDonnell proposed was a variation of a carrier @-@ based Phantom , with the goal of improving both catapult performance and lower approach speeds . The F @-@ 4 ( HL ) would have had a longer fuselage and wingspan , with less sweep , stabilators with increased area and air intakes with auxiliary blow @-@ in doors to increase airflow at low speeds . In the event , this proposal was not taken forward . 
 = = Replacement = = 
 In the early 1970s , the RAF issued an Air Staff Requirement for the development of a new interceptor intended to replace both the Phantom and the Lightning . One initial proposal was a plan introduced by McDonnell Douglas for a variable geometry wing Phantom . This was rejected by the RAF owing to the fact that there was little apparent improvement in performance over the existing Phantom , and that it might affect the development of the " Multi @-@ Role Combat Aircraft " ( MRCA ) . Another idea that the MRCA concept , which eventually evolved into the Panavia Tornado , could be used in the interceptor role , was ruled out , as both its avionics and engines were optimised for the low level interdictor mission . The UK 's partners in the MRCA project displayed no enthusiasm for the idea of developing an air defence version of the Tornado , so the UK alone began the process , with the authorisation for what came to be known as the Tornado ADV issued in March 1976 . With the aircraft in development , the initial plan was for the Tornado to replace the remaining two squadrons of Lightnings , as well as all seven squadrons of Phantoms . However , while the Tornado was in development , the RAF looked at interim measures to replace the Phantom , which had been in service for over a decade by 1980 , and was beginning to suffer from fatigue issues ; one proposal looked at was the possibility of leasing or purchasing a quantity of F @-@ 15 Eagles to re @-@ equip 19 and 92 Squadrons , the units stationed in Germany . Further suggestions were that up to 80 F @-@ 15s be procured , to replace the Phantom and Lightning squadrons then in service , or even cancel the Tornado entirely and purchase the F @-@ 15 with UK adaptations ( specifically to be fitted with the AI.24 Foxhunter radar developed for the Tornado , and capable of carrying the Skyflash air @-@ to @-@ air missile ) . Ultimately , the F @-@ 15 option was not seriously considered , as it was felt there would not be time or cost savings over this plan against the Tornado . Subsequent to this came a decision that the Tornado , once it had entered service , would only re @-@ equip three of the Phantom squadrons , with two retained in the UK and two in Germany . Eventually , the Tornado accounted for the two FG.1 squadrons at RAF Leuchars ( 43 and 111 Squadrons ) , plus two FGR.2 units ( 23 Squadron and 29 Squadron ) , with 56 and 74 Squadrons remaining with the Phantom . 
 In the Royal Navy , the withdrawal of the conventional aircraft carrier was envisaged to see the end of fixed @-@ wing aviation at sea . Because of this policy , 892 Naval Air Squadron used a black capital Omega ( Ω ) letter on the tailfins of their aircraft , as it was believed they would be the final fixed @-@ wing squadron to be commissioned . However , in the 1970s the Royal Navy was developing what was known as the " Through Deck Cruiser " , a 20 @,@ 000 ton ship with a full length flight deck intended to embark a squadron of large anti @-@ submarine warfare helicopters . Almost as soon as the first ship , HMS Invincible , was ordered , an additional specification was added to the design ; as well as the helicopters , a small squadron of STOVL aircraft would form part of the air group to act as a deterrent to long range reconnaissance aircraft . To this end , a navalised version of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier was developed – over the design process , the Sea Harrier was given , in addition to its air defence role , responsibility for reconnaissance and maritime strike missions . In March 1980 , 14 months after 892 Naval Air Squadron was decommissioned and its Phantoms turned over to the RAF , 800 Naval Air Squadron was formed as the first operational Sea Harrier squadron .

 Sir Sydney Camm , the Chief Designer at Hawker for many years , once said that no British aircraft could be considered a success until it was able to match the capabilities of the Phantom . The Phantom 's versatility was such that , in the RAF and Royal Navy , it was the direct replacement in squadron service for a total of four different aircraft types , with nine separate variants amongst them . In turn , when the Phantom was replaced in service , its major roles required three separate aircraft ( see table ) :

 = Let 's Get Down ( Bow Wow song ) = 
 " Let 's Get Down " is a song by American rapper Bow Wow , released on June 24 , 2003 as the first single off his third album Unleashed ( 2003 ) . The song was written by Shad Moss , Phalon Alexander , Rahman Griffin and a then @-@ unknown T.I .. It was produced by Jazze Pha and features rapper Birdman under his alias " Baby " . It 's the first song to be released by Bow Wow without the " Lil ' " moniker in his name after making his film debut in 2002 's Like Mike and releasing his cover of " Basketball " for the film 's soundtrack . Bow Wow said that following the name change , he wanted to do the same with his music by contributing more into the songwriting process of the album and release a single that matched his new image . 
 " Let 's Get Down " garnered a positive reception from critics who credited Bow Wow for displaying some maturity in his music . It peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 , his highest charting single on that chart until 2005 's " Like You " and " Let Me Hold You " . It also peaked at numbers 6 , 8 and 12 on the Hot Rap Songs , Rhythmic Top 40 and Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs charts respectively . A music video by Bryan Barber was made to promote the single that features Bow Wow getting his driver 's license .

 In 2002 , after finishing production on his debut film Like Mike and releasing his cover of " Basketball " for the film 's soundtrack , Bow Wow dropped the " Lil ' " moniker from his name completely . In an interview with MTV , he said he wanted to distinguish himself from the other rappers who had the word in their moniker : 
 " All these Lil ’ rappers , I ’ m just kind of getting real irritated by it . I said , ' You know what ? Drop the Lil ' . Forget it . I ’ m Bow Wow . ' Besides , I ’ m growing up , I ’ m not little anymore . [ I just decided ] two weeks ago . I really got irritable . It ’ s all these Lil ’ cats , forget it . I ’ m Bow Wow now . Everything is just ' Bow Wow , ' no ' Lil ' Bow Wow . ' " 
 " Let 's Get Down " was produced by Jazze Pha , who previously did production for other rappers like Erick Sermon and Ludacris . The song was written by Shad Moss , Phalon Alexander , Rahman Griffin and Clifford Harris ( aka then @-@ unknown T.I. ) . Donnie Kwak of Vibe described the song as a clone of Baby 's " Do That ... , " with " youthful flirting replacing sleazy come @-@ ons . " In an interview with Billboard , he commented on wanting to make an impact after changing his name and wanting to work with rapper Baby , saying that he was looking for a single that would grab people 's attention and that Baby 's inclusion almost didn 't happen but then changed his mind to work with him on the song . 
 In a September 2003 interview with website <unk> , T.I. talked about his contribution to Bow Wow 's third album Unleashed and the song itself : 
 " Yeah this time around I wrote some songs for him . Even on the single , ' Let 's Get Down ' . I wrote the third verse and the hook . Usually how we did it was [ Jazze Pha ] he 'll write one verse , Bow Wow would write one verse , his homeboy Rocka would write one , and I 'd write a verse and come up with the hook . " 
 In a 2009 interview with HipHopDX , Bow Wow commented on how getting T.I. to ghostwrite for him on his third album didn 't tarnish his credibility as a rapper , saying that he learned about the songwriting process by contributing about 85 percent to the album while T.I. wrote a full song and a couple verses to a few tracks . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Let 's Get Down " received a positive reception from music critics . Rashaun Hall of Billboard praised Jazze Pha 's production and Bow Wow for maturing as an MC . He added that , " [ w ] hile Bow Wow 's more mature stance suits him well , it will be interesting to see how his younger fans and mainstream R & B radio react to the teenage MC 's new image . Either way , Bow Wow has proven that his act is no child 's play . " Steve ' Flash ' Juon of RapReviews was also positive towards the song saying , " Annoying bird calls aside , it is a catchy song about Bow Wow trying to catch a little <unk> . " In 2004 , it won an award in the R & B / Hip @-@ Hop category at the SESAC 2004 New York Music Awards , along with the second single " My Baby " . 
 In 2013 , Complex added the song in its list of nineteen great songs made by teenage rappers in the last 19 years . Complex editor Kyle Kramer said " Not only did he have girls trying to get at him , he was boasting of his prowess with the ladies in a PG tone and a teen 's voice , which makes a line like “ I 'll find me another one , more interesting more fun / The man has just begun ” even colder . With a <unk> flow , paired with a killer , clattering faux @-@ Neptunes beat courtesy of Jazze Pha , the kid , the self @-@ proclaimed “ Mr. 106 and Park , ” was unstoppable . "

 " Let 's Get Down " debuted at number 90 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week of July 5 , 2003 . Six weeks later , it entered the top 40 at number 30 for the week of August 16 , 2003 . It peaked at number 14 for the week of September 20 , 2003 and was present on the chart for a total of seventeen weeks . This gave Bow Wow his third top 20 hit and highest charting single on that chart until 2005 's " Like You " and " Let Me Hold You " . The song was also Birdman 's fourth top 40 hit on that chart ( his third as a featured artist ) . It peaked at number 12 on the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs chart , number 6 on the Hot Rap Songs chart and number 8 on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart .

 = Battle of Savo Island = 
 The Battle of Savo Island , also known as the First Battle of Savo Island and , in Japanese sources , as the First Battle of the Solomon Sea ( <unk> , Dai @-@ ichi @-@ ji <unk> Kaisen ) , and colloquially among Allied Guadalcanal veterans as The Battle of the Five Sitting Ducks , was a naval battle of the Pacific Campaign of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and Allied naval forces . The battle took place on August 8 – 9 , 1942 and was the first major naval engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign , and the first of several naval battles in the straits later named Ironbottom Sound , near the island of Guadalcanal . 
 The Imperial Japanese Navy , in response to Allied amphibious landings in the eastern Solomon Islands , mobilized a task force of seven cruisers and one destroyer under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa . The task forces sailed from Japanese bases in New Britain and New Ireland down New Georgia Sound ( also known as " the Slot " ) , with the intention of interrupting the Allied landings by attacking the supporting amphibious fleet and its screening force . The Allied screen consisted of eight cruisers and fifteen destroyers under British Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley VC , but only five cruisers and seven destroyers were involved in the battle . In a night action , Mikawa thoroughly surprised and routed the Allied force , sinking one Australian and three American cruisers , while suffering only light damage in return . The battle has often been cited as the worst defeat in a fair fight in the history of the United States Navy . 
 After the initial engagement , Mikawa , fearing Allied carrier strikes against his fleet upon daybreak , decided to withdraw under cover of night rather than attempt to locate and destroy the Allied invasion transports . The Japanese attacks prompted the remaining Allied warships and the amphibious force to withdraw earlier than planned ( prior to the unloading of all supplies ) , temporarily ceding control of the seas around Guadalcanal to the Japanese . This early withdrawal of the fleet left the Allied ground forces ( primarily United States Marines ) , which had landed on Guadalcanal and nearby islands only two days before , in a precarious situation , with limited supplies , equipment , and food to hold their beachhead . 
 Mikawa 's decision to withdraw under cover of night rather than attempt to destroy the Allied invasion transports was primarily founded on the high risk of Allied carrier strikes against his fleet upon daybreak . In reality , the Allied carrier fleet , similarly fearing Japanese attack , had already withdrawn beyond operational range . This missed opportunity to cripple ( rather than interrupt ) the supply of Allied forces on Guadalcanal contributed to Japan 's inability to later recapture the island . At this early critical stage of the campaign , it allowed the Allied forces to entrench and fortify themselves in sufficient strength to successfully defend the area around Henderson Field until additional Allied reinforcements arrived later in the year . 
 The battle was the first of five costly , large scale sea and air @-@ sea actions fought in support of the ground battles on Guadalcanal itself , as the Japanese sought to counter the American offensive in the Pacific . These sea battles took place every few days , with increasing delays on each side to regroup and refit , until the November 30 , 1942 Battle of Tassafaronga ( sometimes referred to as the Fourth Battle of Savo Island or , in Japanese sources , as the Battle of Lunga Point ( <unk> ) ) — after which the Japanese , eschewing the costly losses , attempted resupplying by submarine and barges . The final naval battle , the Battle of Rennell Island ( Japanese : <unk> ) , took place months later on January 29 – 30 , 1943 by which time the Japanese were preparing to withdraw and evacuate their remaining land forces . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Operations at Guadalcanal = = = 
 On August 7 , 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily U.S. Marines ) landed on Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and Florida Island in the eastern Solomon Islands . The landings were meant to deny their use to the Japanese as bases , especially the nearly completed airfield at Henderson Field that was being constructed on Guadalcanal . If Japanese air and sea forces were allowed to establish forward operating bases in the Eastern Solomons they would be in a position to threaten the supply shipping routes between the U.S. and Australia . The Allies also wanted to use the islands as launching points for a campaign to recapture the Solomons , isolate or capture the major Japanese base at Rabaul , and support the Allied New Guinea campaign , which was then building strength under General Douglas MacArthur . The landings initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long Guadalcanal campaign . 
 The overall commander of Allied naval forces in the Guadalcanal and Tulagi operation was U.S. Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher . He also commanded the carrier task groups providing air cover . U.S. Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner commanded the amphibious fleet that delivered the 16 @,@ 000 Allied troops to Guadalcanal and Tulagi . Also under Turner was British Admiral Victor Crutchley 's screening force of eight cruisers , fifteen destroyers , and five minesweepers . This force was to protect Turner 's ships and provide gunfire support for the landings . Crutchley commanded his force of mostly American ships from his flagship , the Australian heavy cruiser HMAS Australia . 
 The Allied landings took the Japanese by surprise . The Allies secured Tulagi , nearby islets Gavutu and Tanambogo , and the airfield under construction on Guadalcanal by nightfall on August 8 . On August 7 and August 8 , Japanese aircraft based at Rabaul attacked the Allied amphibious forces several times , setting afire the U.S. transport ship George F. Elliott ( which sank later ) and heavily damaging the destroyer USS Jarvis . In these air attacks , the Japanese lost 36 aircraft , while the U.S. lost 19 aircraft , including 14 carrier fighter aircraft . 
 Concerned over the losses to his carrier fighter aircraft strength , anxious about the threat to his carriers from further Japanese air attacks , and worried about his ships ' fuel levels , Fletcher announced that he would be withdrawing his carrier task forces on the evening of August 8 . 
 Some historians contend that Fletcher 's fuel situation was not at all critical but that Fletcher used it to justify his withdrawal from the battle area . Fletcher 's biographer notes that Fletcher concluded that the landing was a success and that no important targets for close air support were at hand . Being concerned over the loss of 21 of his carrier fighters , he assessed that his carriers were threatened by torpedo @-@ bomber strikes , and , wanting to refuel before Japanese naval forces arrived , withdrew as he had previously forewarned Turner and Vandegrift . Turner , however , believed that Fletcher understood that he was to provide air cover until all the transports were unloaded on August 9 . 
 Even though the unloading was going slower than planned , Turner decided that without carrier air cover he would have to withdraw his ships from Guadalcanal . He planned to unload as much as possible during the night and depart the next day . 
 = = = Japanese response = = = 
 Unprepared for the Allied operation at Guadalcanal , the initial Japanese response included airstrikes and an attempted reinforcement . Mikawa , commander of the newly formed Japanese Eighth Fleet headquartered at Rabaul , loaded 519 naval troops on two transports and sent them towards Guadalcanal on August 7 . However , when the Japanese learned that Allied forces at Guadalcanal were stronger than originally reported , the transports were recalled . 
 Mikawa also assembled all the available warships in the area to attack the Allied forces at Guadalcanal . At Rabaul were the heavy cruiser Chōkai ( Mikawa 's flagship ) , the light cruisers Tenryū and Yūbari and the destroyer Yūnagi . En route from Kavieng were four heavy cruisers of Cruiser Division 6 under Rear Admiral Aritomo Goto : Aoba , Furutaka , Kako , and Kinugasa . 
 The Japanese Navy had trained extensively in night @-@ fighting tactics before the war , a fact of which the Allies were unaware . Mikawa hoped to engage the Allied naval forces off Guadalcanal and Tulagi on the night of August 8 and August 9 , when he could employ his night @-@ battle expertise while avoiding attacks from Allied aircraft , which could not operate effectively at night . Mikawa 's warships rendezvoused at sea near Cape St. George in the evening of August 7 and then headed east @-@ southeast . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Prelude = = = 
 Mikawa decided to take his fleet north of Buka Island and then down the east coast of Bougainville . The fleet would pause east of Kieta for six hours on the morning of August 8 . ( This would avoid daytime air attacks during their final approach to Guadalcanal . ) They would then proceed along the dangerous channel known as " The Slot " , hoping that no Allied plane would sight them in the fading light . The Japanese fleet was in fact sighted in St George Channel , where their column almost ran into USS S @-@ 38 , lying in ambush . She was too close to fire torpedoes , but her captain , Lieutenant Commander H.G. Munson , radioed : " Two destroyers and three larger ships of unknown type heading one four zero true at high speed eight miles west of Cape St George " The warnings , however , were considered vague and the size of the force reported did not suggest an attack was pending . 
 Once at Bougainville , Mikawa spread his ships out over a wide area to mask the composition of his force and launched four floatplanes from his cruisers to scout for Allied ships in the southern Solomons . 
 At 10 : 20 and 11 : 10 , his ships were spotted by Royal Australian Air Force Hudson reconnaissance aircraft based at Milne Bay in New Guinea . The first Hudson misidentified them as " three cruisers , three destroyers , and two seaplane tenders " . ( Note : Some accounts state that the first Hudson 's crew identified the enemy ships correctly , but the composition of enemy forces was changed from the aircraft crews ' report by intelligence officers in Milne Bay . ) The Hudson 's crew tried to report the sighting to the Allied radio station at Fall River , New Guinea . Receiving no acknowledgment , they returned to Milne Bay at 12 : 42 to ensure that the report was received as soon as possible . The second Hudson also failed to report its sighting by radio , but completed its patrol and landed at Milne Bay at 15 : 00 . It reported sighting " two heavy cruisers , two light cruisers , and one unknown type " . For unknown reasons , these reports were not relayed to the Allied fleet off Guadalcanal until 18 : 45 and 21 : 30 , respectively , on August 8 . U.S. official historian Samuel Morison wrote in his 1949 account that the RAAF Hudson 's crew failed to report the sighting until after they had landed and even had tea . This claim made international headlines and was repeated by many subsequent historians . Later research has discredited this version of events , and in 2014 , the U.S. Navy 's Naval History and Heritage Command acknowledged in a letter to the Hudson 's radio operator , who had lobbied for decades to clear his crewmates ' name , that Morison 's criticisms were " unwarranted . " 
 Mikawa 's floatplanes returned by 12 : 00 and reported two groups of Allied ships , one off Guadalcanal and the other off Tulagi . He reassembled his warships and began his run towards Guadalcanal , entering the Slot near Choiseul by 16 : 00 on August 8 . Mikawa communicated the following battle plan to his warships : " On the rush @-@ in we will go from S. ( south ) of Savo Island and torpedo the enemy main force in front of Guadalcanal anchorage ; after which we will turn toward the Tulagi forward area to shell and torpedo the enemy . We will then withdraw north of Savo Island . " 
 Mikawa 's run down the Slot was not detected by Allied forces . Turner had requested that U.S. Admiral John S. McCain , Sr. , commander of Allied air forces for the South Pacific area , conduct extra reconnaissance missions over the Slot in the afternoon of August 8 . But , for unexplained reasons , McCain did not order the missions , nor did he tell Turner that they were not carried out . Thus , Turner mistakenly believed that the Slot was under Allied observation throughout the day . 
 To protect the unloading transports during the night , Crutchley divided the Allied warship forces into three groups . A " southern " group , consisting of the Australian cruisers HMAS Australia and HMAS Canberra , cruiser USS Chicago , and destroyers USS Patterson and USS Bagley , patrolled between Lunga Point and Savo Island to block the entrance between Savo Island and Cape Esperance on Guadalcanal . A " northern " group , consisting of the cruisers USS Vincennes , USS Astoria and USS Quincy , and destroyers USS Helm and USS Wilson , conducted a box @-@ shaped patrol between the Tulagi anchorage and Savo Island to defend the passage between Savo and Florida Islands . An " eastern " group consisting of the cruisers USS San Juan and HMAS Hobart and two U.S. destroyers guarded the eastern entrances to the sound between Florida and Guadalcanal Islands . Crutchley placed two radar @-@ equipped U.S. destroyers to the west of Savo Island to provide early warning for any approaching Japanese ships . The destroyer USS Ralph Talbot patrolled the northern passage and the destroyer USS Blue patrolled the southern passage , with a gap of 12 – 30 kilometres ( 8 – 20 mi ) between their uncoordinated patrol patterns . At this time , the Allies were unaware of all of the limitations of their primitive ship @-@ borne radars , such as the effectiveness of the radar could be greatly degraded by the presence of nearby landmasses . Wary of the potential threat from Japanese submarines to the transport ships , Crutchley placed his remaining seven destroyers as close @-@ in protection around the two transport anchorages . 
 The crews of the Allied ships were fatigued after two days of constant alert and action in supporting the landings . Also , the weather was extremely hot and humid , inducing further fatigue and , in Morison 's words , " inviting weary sailors to slackness . " In response , most of Crutchley 's warships went to " Condition II " the night of August 8 , which meant that half the crews were on duty while the other half rested , either in their bunks or near their battle stations . 
 In the evening , Turner called a conference on his command ship off Guadalcanal with Crutchley and Marine commander Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift to discuss the departure of Fletcher 's carriers and the resulting withdrawal schedule for the transport ships . At 20 : 55 , Crutchley left the southern group in Australia to attend the conference , leaving Captain Howard D. Bode of Chicago in charge of the southern group . Crutchley did not inform the commanders of the other cruiser groups of his absence , contributing further to the dissolution of command arrangements . Bode , awakened from sleep in his cabin , decided not to place his ship in the lead of the southern group of ships , the customary place for the senior ship , and went back to sleep . At the conference , Turner , Crutchley , and Vandegrift discussed the reports of the " seaplane tender " force reported by the Australian Hudson crew earlier that day . They decided it would not be a threat that night , because seaplane tenders did not normally engage in a surface action . Vandegrift said that he would need to inspect the transport unloading situation at Tulagi before recommending a withdrawal time for the transport ships , and he departed at midnight to conduct the inspection . Crutchley elected not to return with Australia to the southern force but instead stationed his ship just outside the Guadalcanal transport anchorage , without informing the other Allied ship commanders of his intentions or location . 
 As Mikawa 's force neared the Guadalcanal area , the Japanese ships launched three floatplanes for one final reconnaissance of the Allied ships , and to provide illumination by dropping flares during the upcoming battle . Although several of the Allied ships heard and / or observed one or more of these floatplanes , starting at 23 : 45 on August 8 , none of them interpreted the presence of unknown aircraft in the area as an actionable threat , and no one reported the sightings to Crutchley or Turner . 
 Mikawa 's force approached in a single 3 kilometre ( 2 mi ) column led by Chōkai , with Aoba , Kako , Kinugasa , Furutaka , Tenryū , Yūbari , and Yūnagi following . Sometime between 00 : 44 and 00 : 54 on August 9 , lookouts in Mikawa 's ships spotted Blue about 9 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 5 mi ) ahead of the Japanese column . 
 = = = Action south of Savo = = = 
 To avoid Blue , Mikawa changed course to pass north of Savo Island . He also ordered his ships to slow to 22 knots ( 41 km / h ) , to reduce wakes that might make his ships more visible . Four minutes later , Mikawa 's lookouts spied either Ralph Talbot about 16 kilometres ( 10 mi ) away or a small schooner of unknown nationality . The Japanese ships held their course while pointing more than 50 guns at Blue , ready to open fire at the first indication that Blue had sighted them . When Blue was less than 2 kilometres ( 1 mi ) away from Mikawa 's force , she suddenly reversed course , having reached the end of her patrol track , and steamed away , apparently oblivious to the long column of large Japanese ships sailing by her . Seeing that his ships were still undetected , Mikawa turned back to a course south of Savo Island and increased speed , first to 26 knots ( 48 km / h ) , and then to 30 knots ( 56 km / h ) . At 01 : 25 , Mikawa released his ships to operate independently of his flagship , and at 01 : 31 , he ordered , " Every ship attack . " 
 At about this time , Yūnagi detached from the Japanese column and reversed direction , perhaps because she lost sight of the other Japanese ships ahead of her , or perhaps she was ordered to provide a " rear guard " for Mikawa 's force . One minute later , Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port . This ship was the destroyer Jarvis , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia . Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown , since her radios had been destroyed . Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis , which all missed . The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1 @,@ 100 meters , close enough for officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer 's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about . If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by , she did not respond in any noticeable way . 
 Two minutes after sighting Jarvis , the Japanese lookouts sighted the Allied destroyers and cruisers of the southern force about 12 @,@ 500 metres away , silhouetted by the glow from the burning George F. Elliott . Several minutes later , at about 01 : 38 , the Japanese cruisers began launching salvos of torpedoes at the Allied southern force ships . At this same time , lookouts on Chōkai spotted the ships of the Allied northern force at a range of 16 kilometres ( 10 mi ) . Chōkai turned to face this new threat , and the rest of the Japanese column followed , while still preparing to engage the Allied southern force ships with gunfire . 
 Patterson 's crew was alert because the destroyer 's captain had taken seriously the earlier daytime sightings of Japanese warships and evening sightings of unknown aircraft , and told his crew to be ready for action . At 01 : 43 , Patterson spotted a ship , probably Kinugasa , 5 @,@ 000 meters dead ahead and immediately sent a warning by radio and signal lamp : " Warning ! Warning ! Strange ships entering the harbor ! " Patterson increased speed to full , and fired star shells towards the Japanese column . Her captain ordered a torpedo attack , but his order was not heard over the noise from the destroyer 's guns . 
 At about the same moment that Patterson sighted the Japanese ships and went into action , the Japanese floatplanes overhead , on orders from Mikawa , dropped aerial flares directly over Canberra and Chicago . Canberra responded immediately , with Captain Frank Getting ordering an increase in speed , a reversal of an initial turn to port , which kept Canberra between the Japanese and the Allied transports , and for her guns to train out and fire at any targets that could be sighted . Less than one minute later , as Canberra 's guns took aim at the Japanese , Chōkai and Furutaka opened fire on her , scoring numerous hits within a few seconds . Aoba and Kako joined in with gunfire , and within the next three minutes Canberra took up to 24 large caliber hits . Early hits killed her gunnery officer , mortally wounded Getting , and destroyed both boiler rooms , knocking out power to the entire ship before Canberra could fire any of her guns or communicate a warning to other Allied ships . The cruiser glided to a stop , on fire , with a 5- to 10 @-@ degree list to starboard , and unable to fight the fires or pump out flooded compartments because of lack of power . Since all of the Japanese ships were on the port side of Canberra , the damage to the ship 's starboard side occurred either from shells entering low on the port side and exiting below the waterline on the starboard side , or from one or two torpedo hits on the starboard side . If torpedoes did hit Canberra on the starboard side , then they may have come from a nearby Allied ship , and at this time the U.S. destroyer Bagley was the only ship on that side of the Australian cruiser and had fired torpedoes moments earlier . 
 The crew of Chicago , observing the illumination of their ship by air @-@ dropped flares and the sudden turn by Canberra in front of them , came alert and awakened Captain Bode from " a sound sleep " . Bode ordered his 5 in ( 127 @.@ 0 mm ) guns to fire star shells towards the Japanese column , but the shells did not function . At 01 : 47 , a torpedo , probably from Kako , hit Chicago 's bow , sending a shock wave throughout the ship that damaged the main battery director . A second torpedo hit but failed to explode , and a shell hit the cruiser 's mainmast , killing two crewmen . Chicago steamed west for 40 minutes , leaving behind the transports she was assigned to protect . The cruiser fired her secondary batteries at the trailing ships in the Japanese column and may have hit Tenryū , causing slight damage . Bode did not try to assert control over any of the other Allied ships in the southern force , of which he was still technically in command . More significantly , Bode made no attempt to warn any of the other Allied ships or personnel in the Guadalcanal area as his ship headed away from the battle area . 
 During this time , Patterson engaged in a gun duel with the Japanese column . Patterson received a shell hit aft , causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members . Patterson continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may have hit Kinugasa , causing moderate damage . Patterson then lost sight of the Japanese column as it headed northeast along the eastern shore of Savo Island . Bagley , whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after Patterson and Canberra , circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes in the general direction of the rapidly disappearing Japanese column ; one or two of which may have hit Canberra . Bagley played no further role in the battle . Yūnagi exchanged non @-@ damaging gunfire with Jarvis before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island . 
 At 01 : 44 , as Mikawa 's ships headed towards the Allied northern force , Tenryū and Yūbari split from the rest of the Japanese column and took a more westward course . Furutaka , either because of a steering problem , or to avoid a possible collision with Canberra , followed Yūbari and Tenryū . Thus , the Allied northern force was about to be enveloped and attacked from two sides . 
 = = = Action north of Savo = = = 
 When Mikawa 's ships attacked the Allied southern force , the captains of all three U.S. northern force cruisers were asleep , with their ships steaming quietly at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ) . Although crewmen on all three ships observed flares or gunfire from the battle south of Savo or else received Patterson 's warning of threatening ships entering the area , it took some time for the crews to go from Condition II to full alert . At 01 : 44 , the Japanese cruisers began firing torpedoes at the northern force . At 01 : 50 , they aimed powerful searchlights at the three northern cruisers and opened fire with their guns . 
 Astoria 's bridge crew called general quarters upon sighting the flares south of Savo , around 01 : 49 . At 01 : 52 , shortly after the Japanese searchlights came on and shells began falling around the ship , Astoria 's main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers and opened fire . Astoria 's captain , awakened to find his ship in action , rushed to the bridge and ordered a ceasefire , fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces . As shells continued to cascade around his ship , the captain ordered firing resumed less than a minute later . Chōkai , however , had found the range , and Astoria was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire . Between 02 : 00 and 02 : 15 , Aoba , Kinugasa , and Kako joined Chōkai in pounding Astoria , destroying the cruiser 's engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt . At 02 : 16 , one of Astoria 's remaining operational main gun turrets fired at Kinugasa 's searchlight , but missed and hit Chōkai 's forward turret , putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the ship . 
 Quincy had also seen the aircraft flares over the southern ships , received Patterson 's warning , and had just sounded general quarters and was coming alert when the searchlights from the Japanese column came on . Quincy 's captain gave the order to commence firing , but the gun crews were not ready . Within a few minutes , Quincy was caught in a crossfire between Aoba , Furutaka , and Tenryū , and was hit heavily and set afire . Quincy 's captain ordered his cruiser to charge towards the eastern Japanese column , but as she turned to do so Quincy was hit by two torpedoes from Tenryū , causing severe damage . Quincy managed to fire a few main gun salvos , one of which hit Chōkai 's chart room 6 meters ( 20 ft ) from Admiral Mikawa and killed or wounded 36 men , although Mikawa was not injured . At 02 : 10 , incoming shells killed or wounded almost all of Quincy 's bridge crew , including the captain . At 02 : 16 , the cruiser was hit by a torpedo from Aoba , and the ship 's remaining guns were silenced . Quincy 's assistant gunnery officer , sent to the bridge to ask for instructions , reported on what he found : 
 When I reached the bridge level , I found it a shambles of dead bodies with only three or four people still standing . In the Pilot House itself the only person standing was the signalman at the wheel who was vainly endeavoring to check the ship 's swing to starboard to bring her to port . On questioning him I found out that the Captain , who at that time was laying [ sic ] near the wheel , had instructed him to beach the ship and he was trying to head for Savo Island , distant some four miles ( 6 km ) on the port quarter . I stepped to the port side of the Pilot House , and looked out to find the island and noted that the ship was heeling rapidly to port , sinking by the bow . At that instant the Captain straightened up and fell back , apparently dead , without having uttered any sound other than a moan . 
 Quincy sank , bow first , at 02 : 38 . 
 Like Quincy and Astoria , Vincennes also sighted the aerial flares to the south , and furthermore , actually sighted gunfire from the southern engagement . At 01 : 50 , when the U.S. cruisers were illuminated by the Japanese searchlights , Vincennes hesitated to open fire , believing that the searchlight 's source might be friendly ships . Shortly thereafter , Kako opened fire on Vincennes which responded with her own gunfire at 01 : 53 . As Vincennes began to receive damaging shell hits , her commander , U.S. Captain Frederick L. Riefkohl , ordered an increase of speed to 25 knots ( 46 km / h ) , but shortly thereafter , at 01 : 55 , two torpedoes from Chōkai hit , causing heavy damage . Kinugasa now joined Kako in pounding Vincennes . Vincennes scored one hit on Kinugasa causing moderate damage to her steering engines . The rest of the Japanese ships also fired and hit Vincennes up to 74 times , and , at 02 : 03 , another torpedo hit her , this time from Yūbari . With all boiler rooms destroyed , Vincennes came to a halt , burning " everywhere " and listing to port . At 02 : 16 , Riefkohl ordered the crew to abandon ship , and Vincennes sank at 02 : 50 . 
 During the engagement , the U.S. destroyers Helm and Wilson struggled to see the Japanese ships . Both destroyers briefly fired at Mikawa 's cruisers but caused no damage and received no damage to themselves . 
 At 02 : 16 , the Japanese columns ceased fire on the northern Allied force as they moved out of range around the north side of Savo Island . Ralph Talbot encountered Furutaka , Tenryū , and Yūbari as they cleared Savo Island . The Japanese ships fixed the U.S. destroyer with searchlights and hit her several times with gunfire , causing heavy damage , but Ralph Talbot escaped into a nearby rain squall , and the Japanese ships left her behind . 
 = = = Mikawa 's decision = = = 
 At 02 : 16 Mikawa conferred with his staff about whether they should turn to continue the battle with the surviving Allied warships and try to sink the Allied transports in the two anchorages . Several factors influenced his ultimate decision . His ships were scattered and would take some time to regroup . His ships would need to reload their torpedo tubes , a labor @-@ intensive task that would take some time . Mikawa also did not know the number and locations of any remaining Allied warships and his ships had expended much of their ammunition . 
 More importantly , Mikawa had no air cover and believed that U.S. aircraft carriers were in the area . Mikawa was probably aware that the Japanese Navy had no more heavy cruisers in production , and thus would be unable to replace any he might lose to air attack the next day if he remained near Guadalcanal . He was unaware that the U.S. carriers had withdrawn from the battle area and would not be a threat the next day . Although several of Mikawa 's staff urged an attack on the Allied transports , the consensus was to withdraw from the battle area . Therefore , at 02 : 20 , Mikawa ordered his ships to retire . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 At 04 : 00 on August 9 Patterson came alongside Canberra to assist the cruiser in fighting her fires . By 05 : 00 , it appeared that the fires were almost under control , but Turner , who at this time intended to withdraw all Allied ships by 06 : 30 , ordered the ship to be scuttled if she was not able to accompany the fleet . After the survivors were removed , the destroyers USS Selfridge and USS Ellet sank Canberra which took some 300 shells and five torpedoes before she succumbed . 
 Later in the morning of August 9 General Vandegrift advised Admiral Turner that he needed more supplies unloaded from the transports before they withdrew . Therefore , Turner postponed the withdrawal of his ships until mid @-@ afternoon . In the meantime , Astoria 's crew tried to save their sinking ship . Astoria 's fires , however , eventually became completely out of control , and the ship sank at 12 : 15 . 
 On the morning of August 9 , an Australian coastwatcher on Bougainville radioed a warning of a Japanese airstrike on the way from Rabaul . The Allied transport crews ceased unloading for a time but were puzzled when the airstrike did not materialize . Allied forces did not discover until after the war was over that this Japanese airstrike instead concentrated on USS Jarvis south of Guadalcanal , sinking her with all hands . The Allied transports and warships all departed the Guadalcanal area by nightfall on August 9 . 
 In the late evening of August 9 , Mikawa on Chōkai released the four cruisers of Cruiser Division 6 to return to their home base at Kavieng . At 08 : 10 on August 10 , Kako was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine USS S @-@ 44 110 kilometers ( 70 mi ) from her destination . The other three Japanese cruisers picked up all but 71 of her crew and went on to Kavieng . 
 From the time of the battle until several months later , almost all Allied supplies and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys , mainly during daylight hours , while Allied aircraft from the New Hebrides and Henderson Field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions . During this time , Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to withstand the several Japanese drives to retake the islands . 
 Despite their defeat in this battle , the Allies eventually won the battle for Guadalcanal , an important step in the eventual defeat of Japan . In hindsight , if Mikawa had elected to risk his ships to go after the Allied transports on the morning of August 9 , he could have improved the chances of Japanese victory in the Guadalcanal campaign at its inception , and the course of the war in the southern Pacific could have gone much differently . Although the Allied warships at Guadalcanal that night were completely routed , the transports were unaffected . Many of these same transports were used many times to bring crucial supplies and reinforcements to Allied forces on Guadalcanal over succeeding months . Mikawa 's decision not to destroy the Allied transport ships when he had the opportunity would prove to be a crucial strategic mistake for the Japanese . 
 A formal United States Navy board of inquiry , known as the Hepburn Investigation , prepared a report of the battle . The board interviewed most of the major Allied officers involved over several months , beginning in December 1942 . The report recommended official censure for only one officer , Captain Howard D. Bode of the Chicago , for failing to broadcast a warning to the fleet of encroaching enemy ships . The report stopped short of recommending formal action against other Allied officers , including Admirals Fletcher , Turner , McCain , and Crutchley , and Captain Riefkohl . The careers of Turner , Crutchley , and McCain do not appear to have been affected by the defeat or the mistakes they made in contributing to it . Riefkohl , however , never commanded ships again . Captain Bode , upon learning that the report was going to be especially critical of his actions , shot himself in his quarters at Balboa , Panama Canal Zone , on April 19 , 1943 , and died the next day . Crutchley was gazetted with the Legion of Merit ( Chief Commander ) in September 1944 . Admiral Yamamoto signaled a congratulatory note to Mikawa on his victory , stating , " <unk> the courageous and hard fighting of every man of your organisation . I expect you to expand your exploits and you will make every effort to support the land forces of the Imperial army which are now engaged in a desperate struggle . " Later on , though , when it became apparent that Mikawa had missed an opportunity to destroy the Allied transports , he was intensely criticised by his comrades . Admiral Turner later assessed why his forces were so soundly defeated in the battle : 
 " The Navy was still obsessed with a strong feeling of technical and mental superiority over the enemy . In spite of ample evidence as to enemy capabilities , most of our officers and men despised the enemy and felt themselves sure victors in all encounters under any circumstances . The net result of all this was a fatal lethargy of mind which induced a confidence without readiness , and a routine acceptance of outworn peacetime standards of conduct . I believe that this psychological factor , as a cause of our defeat , was even more important than the element of surprise " . 
 Historian Richard B. Frank adds that , " This lethargy of mind would not be completely shaken off without some more hard blows to ( U.S. ) Navy pride around Guadalcanal , but after Savo , the United States picked itself up off the deck and prepared for the most savage combat in its history . " 
 = Nebula Award = 
 The Nebula Awards annually recognize the best works of science fiction or fantasy published in the United States during the previous year . The awards are organized and awarded by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America ( SFWA ) , a nonprofit association of professional science fiction and fantasy writers . They were first given in 1966 at a ceremony created for the awards , and are given in four categories for different lengths of literary works . A fifth category for film and television episode scripts was given 1974 – 78 and 2000 – 09 . The rules governing the Nebula Awards have changed several times during the awards ' history , most recently in 2010 . 
 The Nebula Awards have been termed as one of " the most important of the American science fiction awards " . Winning works have been published in special collections , and winners and nominees are often noted as such on the books ' cover . SFWA numbers the awards by the year prior to the year the award is given in ; the 2012 awards were presented in San Jose , California on May 18 , 2013 . 
 For lists of winners and nominees for each Nebula category , see the list of categories below . 
 = = Award = = 
 The Nebula Awards are given each year by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America ( SFWA ) for the best science fiction or fantasy fiction published in the United States during the previous year . The winner receives a trophy but no cash prize ; the trophy is a transparent block with an embedded glitter spiral nebula and gemstones cut to resemble planets . The trophy itself was designed for the first awards by J. A. Lawrence , based on a sketch by Kate Wilhelm , and has remained the same ever since . Works are eligible for an award if they were published in English in the prior calendar year . There are no written rules as to which works qualify as science fiction or fantasy , and the decision of eligibility in that regard is left up to the nominators and voters , rather than to SFWA . 
 Nebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of the SFWA , though the authors of the nominees do not need to be members . Works are nominated each year between November 15 and February 15 by published authors who are members of the organization , and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot , with additional nominees possible in the case of ties . Members may then vote on the ballot throughout March , and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May . Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works , though they can decline nominations , and ties in the final vote are broken , if possible , by the number of nominations the works received . 
 = = History = = 
 The first Nebulas were given in 1966 , for works published in 1965 . The idea for such an award , funded by the sales of anthologies collecting the winning works , was proposed by SFWA secretary @-@ treasurer Lloyd <unk> , Jr. in 1965 . The idea was based on the Edgar Awards , presented by the Mystery Writers of America , and hosting a ceremony to present them at was prompted by the Edgar and Hugo Awards . The initial ceremony consisted of four literary awards , for Novels , Novellas , Novelettes , and Short Stories , which have been presented every year since . A Script award was also presented from 1974 to 1978 under the names Best Dramatic Presentation and Best Dramatic Writing and again from 2000 through 2009 as Best Script , but after 2009 it was again removed and replaced by SFWA with the Ray Bradbury Award . 
 Prior to 2009 , the Nebula Awards employed a rolling eligibility system . Each work was eligible to qualify for the ballot for one year following its date of publication . As a consequence of rolling eligibility , there was the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that . Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations , which were then voted on to create the final ballot . In 1970 , the option was added for voters to select " no award " if they felt that no nominated work was worthy of winning ; this happened in 1971 in the Short Story category and in 1977 in the Script category . 
 Beginning in 1980 the eligibility year for nominations was set to the calendar year , rather than December – November as initially conceived , and the SFWA organizing panel was allowed to add an additional work . Authors were also allowed to use the mass @-@ market paperback publication of their books as the beginning of their nomination period , rather than the initial hardback publication . As a consequence of the combination of this rule and the rolling eligibility , the 2007 awards , despite nominally being for works published in 2006 , instead were all given to works initially published in 2005 . Beginning with the 2010 awards , the rolling eligibility system and paperback publication exemption were replaced with the current rules . 
 = = Categories = = 
 Beside the Nebulas , several other awards and honors are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony , though not necessarily every year . Two of them are annual literary awards voted by SFWA members on the Nebula ballot : the Andre Norton Award for Outstanding Young Adult Science Fiction or Fantasy Book , inaugurated 2006 , and the Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation , which replaced the Best Script award in 2010 . The others are the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award since 1975 for " lifetime achievement in science fiction and / or fantasy " , the Author Emeritus since 1995 for contributions to the field , the Kevin O 'Donnell , Jr . Award for service to SFWA , and the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award since 2009 for significant impact on speculative fiction . All four are discretionary but a Grand Master , selected by the officers and past presidents , has been named every year for more than a decade . The Solstice Award may be presented posthumously ( where only living writers may be named Grand Master or Author Emeritus ) ; in all , twelve have been awarded in five years to 2013 .

 The Nebula Awards have been described as one of " the most important of the American science fiction awards " and " the science @-@ fiction and fantasy equivalent " of the Emmy Awards . Along with the Hugo Award , the Nebula Award is also considered one of the premier awards in science fiction , with Laura Miller of Salon terming it " science fiction 's most prestigious award " , and Justine Larbalestier , in The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction ( 2002 ) , referring to it and the Hugo Award as " the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards " . Brian Aldiss , in his book Trillion Year Spree : The History of Science Fiction , claimed that the Nebula Award provided " more literary judgment " while the Hugo was a barometer of reader popularity , rather than artistic merit , though he did note that the winners of the two awards often overlapped . David Langford and Peter Nicholls stated in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction ( 2012 ) that the two awards were often given to the same works , and noted that some critics felt that the Nebula selection reflected " political as much as literary ability " as it did not seem to focus as much on literary talent over popularity as expected . 
 Several people within the publishing industry have said that winning or being nominated for a Nebula Award has effects on the author 's career and the sales of that work . Spider Robinson in 1992 , as quoted in Science Fiction Culture ( 2000 ) , said that publishers " pay careful attention " to who wins a Nebula Award . Literary agent Richard Curtis said in his 1996 Mastering the Business of Writing that having the term Nebula Award on the cover , even as a nominee , was a " powerful inducement " to science fiction fans to buy a novel , and Gahan Wilson , in First World Fantasy Awards ( 1977 ) , claimed that noting that a book had won the Nebula Award on the cover " demonstrably " increased sales for that novel . 
 There have been several anthologies collecting Nebula @-@ winning short fiction . The series Nebula Winners , published yearly by SFWA and edited by a variety of SFWA members and renamed as the Nebula Awards Showcase series since 1999 , was started in 1966 as a collection of short story winners and nominees for that year . The sales of these anthologies were intended to pay for presenting the awards themselves . The anthology The Best of the Nebulas ( 1989 ) , edited by Ben Bova , collected winners of Nebula awards from 1966 through 1986 officially selected by SFWA members . The unofficial anthology Nebula Award Winning Novellas ( 1994 ) , edited by Martin H. Greenberg , contained ten stories which had won the novella award between 1970 and 1989 . 
 = Ready ( Trey Songz album ) = 
 Ready is the third studio album by American R & B recording artist Trey Songz . It was released on August 31 , 2009 , by Troy Taylor 's record label Songbook , distributed by Atlantic Records . The album serves as the sequel to Trey Day ( 2007 ) . Production for the album took place during from 2008 to 2009 , which contributed by Songz 's longtime collaborator and his mentor Troy Taylor , along with Bryan @-@ Michael Cox , StarGate and Los da Mystro , among others . 
 The album received generally positive reviews from critics , which positively compared Ready to the work of R. Kelly , but also was criticized for this album 's inconsistency . The album debuted at number 3 on the US Billboard 200 , selling 131 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . The album was a certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , becoming Songz 's first certified album . 4 years later , Ready was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . 
 All five singles have achieved chart success , including the top ten Billboard Hot 100 hit " Say Aah " , and the top five Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs hits " Neighbors Know My Name " and " I Invented Sex " , the latter of which topped the chart . Songz promoted Ready in a number of live appearances , including co @-@ heading the 106 & Live tour , sponsored by 106 & Park , and serving as a support act on Jay @-@ Z 's The Blueprint 3 Tour . Ready earned Songz a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R & B Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards ; but lost to Beyoncé Knowles ' I Am ... Sasha Fierce . 
 = = Background and production = = 
 When Songz began recording for Ready ; the purpose of the album was to crossover and increase his exposure on radio . The album 's lead single , " I Need a Girl " was released to connect to mainstream radio . Songz said that " [ it ] was a very radio @-@ geared record which would do great and play on radio heavily during whatever time . It wasn 't a record I expected to last forever , or one I was even excited about singing , but it was a record I knew would do well . " Speaking of the following singles , Songz thought that " I Invented Sex " would be a " career @-@ defining record , and I knew ' Say Aah ' would be a monster club record . " 
 Speaking on his collaborations with the producers , Songz said that on Ready , " we 're breaking down every song , every hook , every chorus , every bridge , and we 're making sure every song is the best song it could be . This album isn 't just going to be a compilation of songs , but a classic body of work . " The album only contained three guest features with Drake , Gucci Mane and Soulja Boy Tell ' Em . Songz wanted to keep the amount of features very limited , and stated that " anybody else I add is going to be very special " . American rapper Fabolous was added as a guest feature on the track , titled " Say Aah " . 
 Songz said that compared to his previous albums , " this album is very adult , very easygoing and very sexy [ ... ] My first album was very adult @-@ like , but in a different , more soulful , sample @-@ driven kind of way , and my second one was more contemporary and trendy . " To reflect his transition into adulthood and the changes in his music , Songz changed his appearance by cutting off his trademark braids . Songz also began dressing in more sophisticated attire , trading in sneakers and T @-@ shirts for vests , tailored pants , and " tasteful " shoes . On the appearance change , Songz 's mentor , producer , and the head of Songbook Entertainment , Troy Taylor said , " Trey 's from the streets , he 's a hood kid . He wasn 't glamorous and ( didn 't have ) the finer things in life growing up , [ ... ] He didn 't want to lose his street @-@ ism , [ ... ] As he grew into it I think he began to realize , ' Wait a minute , this ain 't that bad after all , ' and then he got the ladies ' opinions . " 
 After Ready 's success , Songz explained that the album was a result of his growth and new @-@ found maturity . Commenting about the success of his singles , Songz stated that " they 're very strong records and they 're not just radio records . They 're records that embody the person I am as well as the artist I am . I think they 're more definitive of who I am than any other album I 've had . I 've grown as an artist . I 've been doing this for awhile [ sic ] now . As I 've matured , I 've learned how to exude that of which I want to be felt . I 've learned what my fans want from me and things of that nature . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 The album contains influences of R & B , hip @-@ hop and pop , with a bit of soul , as much of the work has been compared to vintage R. Kelly . Concerning the album 's lyrical content , Ken Capobianco of the Boston Globe said , " While many male modern R & B vocalists are moving to a more mature vibe , Trey Songz keeps the <unk> @-@ with @-@ a @-@ heart tradition alive with his third album . " Sean Fennessey of The Village Voice said , that Ready , featured Songz 's " re @-@ imagining the notion of flow — if not melody — just as his hero Kelly did 15 years ago . " Andrew Rennie of Now Magazine said the production had a 1980s soundtrack vibe . According to Mark Edward Nero of About.com , " I Need A Girl " contains familiar qualities of Songz 's breakout hit " Can 't Help but Wait " , also produced by Stargate . The song is lyrically about finding and pleasing the right woman . The song has also been described to be a mix of Usher and Justin Timberlake 
 Melanie <unk> of Billboard said that " Neighbors Know My Name " " employs a knocking bassline and drip @-@ drop effect to provide the ideal erotic backdrop for Songz 's dirty talk . " " Black Roses " is " set to quasi @-@ electronica production , buoyed by a soulful vocal arrangement . " Tyler Lewis of PopMatters said " Be Where You Are " was reminiscent of Jordan Knight 's " Give It to You " , and called it Songz 's purest pop song to date . " Yo Side of the Bed " , containing soul influences , has been called R & B @-@ pop rock similar to some of Beyoncé 's work on I Am ... Sasha Fierce and Brandy on Human . " LOL : - ) " is lyrically about sexting , while featuring a " ringtone @-@ ready " chorus , and heavy percussion .

 Promoting the album , a major online campaign was launched , his blog site , <unk> , on which Songz streams live chats and behind @-@ the @-@ scenes videos . He also released a track on his Twitter every Monday , some of which was from his mixtape Anticipation , which preceded the album 's release . Songz embarked on a promo tour on July 25 , 2009 , with stops in Chicago , Miami , Atlanta , Dallas and the Carolinas , where he attended radio events and listening sessions . He also toured the House of Blues in September , as well as a college tour that fall . In addition to co @-@ headlining the 106 & Live ! tour with Mario , also featuring Day26 and Sean Garrett , which toured from September 29 , 2009 to October 31 , 2009 , Songz served as a supporting act in 2010 for Jay @-@ Z 's The Blueprint 3 Tour , along with Young Jeezy .

 Ready received mostly positive reviews from professional critics , which received an aggregate score of 67 out of 100 . The score , indicating " generally favorable reviews " was based on six reviews from website Metacritic . It received many comparisons to the work of R & B artist R. Kelly , while several critics noted it as inconsistent . David Jeffries of Allmusic said that " Even at a whopping 17 like @-@ minded tracks , all @-@ night lovers wouldn 't be caught dead complaining about how overly long it all is " , commenting that Ready " is as entertaining and frivolous as a one @-@ night stand should be . " Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe said that Songz had developed as a vocalist stating his voice was more " elastic " and he used his falsetto " judiciously . " Capobianco commended tracks like " Be Where You Are , " and " Love Lost " , commenting that " tracks like that show that he is indeed ready for the next step . " Andrew Rennie of Now said , " slight deviations from R & B ’ s classic formula allow Trey Songz wiggle room to play with his multi @-@ octave voice . This offering sets him apart from other acts and may secure his spot in the canon of bedroom crooners . " Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that after making his name for singing hooks on rap songs , that he " shows his smooth R & B vocals can hold the spotlight all on their own . " Rolling Stone gave the album 3 ½ out of 5 stars and wrote that Songz " takes cues from R. Kelly , slyly mocking the self @-@ parodying excesses of boudoir R & B while supplying the utilitarian goods : the sumptuous vocal harmonies and sultry beats upon which long nights beneath ceiling mirrors depend " . A writer for USA Today said the album reflects his broad appeal , and that Songz 's proves " he 's comfortable as a rogue or romantic . Even though the review pointed out that " he occasionally falls back on booty @-@ call clichés , " it did point out that " his song craft shines on the edgy " Black Roses " and regretful " Love Lost . " Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said , " ' Ready ' is one of the year ’ s most promising R & B albums , and a curious one at that " , commenting , " the results are bawdy but never lecherous ; sometimes all his enthusiastic bedroom talk has an air of childlike goofiness to it , as if he were thrilled to get away with boasting so freely . " Sean <unk> of The Village Voice called the album " one of the year 's best ... " 
 Despite viewing it imperfect and noting Songz had not mastered the balancing act " between being a horny boy and ladies ' man " , Mark Edward Nero of About.com said it was the best album of Songz 's career , commenting , " Trey takes a big step toward establishing himself as an A @-@ list singer . " Nero also commended consistent vocals as a plus , and complimented the <unk> of the songs , saying no tracks are unlistenable . Tyler Lewis of PopMatters said that Songz continued his tradition of inconsistent albums , commenting that the album is best is when it departs from the R. Kelly template . Lewis recommended that the album needed to be trimmed down and included with some from his mixtape Anticipation for what could have been , " the black pop record of the year . " In his consumer guide for MSN Music , critic Robert Christgau gave to the album a dud ( ) rating , indicating " a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought . At the upper level it may merely be overrated , disappointing , or dull . Down below it may be contemptible " . Ajitpaul Mangat of Tiny Mix Tapes called the album often " generic " and " monotonous " noting how Songz 's work on freestyles and work ethic proves how the album could be better . Mangat did overall compliment the album , " While Ready is far from a perfect album , it seems Trey is learning how to <unk> his original works with the charm and inventiveness found in his freestyles and covers . " The album earned Songz a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R & B Album in 2010 .

 = Millwall F.C. – West Ham United F.C. rivalry = 
 The rivalry between Millwall and West Ham United is one of the longest @-@ standing and most bitter in English football . The two teams , then known as Millwall Athletic and Thames Ironworks , both originated in the East End of London , and were located under three miles apart . Their supporters were predominantly dockers at shipyards on either side of the River Thames . Consequently , each set of fans worked for rival firms who were competing for the same business ; this intensified the tension between the teams . 
 They first played against each other in the 1899 – 1900 FA Cup . In 1910 Millwall moved south of the River Thames and the teams were no longer East London neighbours . Even so , the derbies retained their passion and both sets of supporters still consider the other club their main rival . Before the First World War the teams met 60 times in just 16 years , mostly in the Southern and Western Football Leagues . The teams have usually competed in different divisions since , spending only 12 seasons in the same tier of the Football League . They have played a total of 39 times in league and cup competitions since 1916 . 
 The rivalry between the teams has been depicted in films that focused specifically on the animosity between the clubs ' two hooligan firms , the Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers . Violence has occurred sporadically between the fans , once resulting in the death of a Millwall supporter in 1976 . Most recently in the 2009 Upton Park riot , widespread disorder between supporters in and around West Ham 's Upton Park ground led to numerous injuries and a Millwall fan being stabbed before the match began . 
 In the last two games between the sides in the 2011 – 12 season , the Metropolitan Police implemented London @-@ wide operations to ensure the games were trouble @-@ free . As of the 2015 – 16 season , West Ham play in the Premier League and Millwall play in the Football League One , two tiers below . 
 = = History of the rivalry = = 
 = = = Founding of the clubs : 1885 – 98 = = = 
 Millwall Rovers Football Club was formed in 1885 by <unk> at JT Morton 's canned food factory on the Isle of Dogs in the East End of London . Ten years later , Thames Ironworks Football Club was formed by Dave Taylor , a foreman at Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company , London 's last major shipbuilding firm . Arnold Hills , the company owner , decided to form a football team to improve the morale of his workforce . The two clubs were situated under three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) apart . With each set of players and supporters working for opposing firms , competing for the same contracts , rivalries developed . The earliest meetings between the clubs were reserve games : the first ended in a 6 – 0 home win for Millwall Athletic Reserves on 14 December 1895 over a newly formed Thames Ironworks side . On 23 September 1897 , the two sides played a first @-@ team friendly match at Millwall 's Athletic Grounds , Millwall Athletic won 2 – 0 in front of a crowd of 1 @,@ 200 spectators . 
 = = = Sixty meetings in sixteen years : 1899 – 1915 = = = 
 On 9 December 1899 the two teams met for their first competitive fixture – a Fifth Round qualifying match in the FA Cup . Millwall Athletic won 2 – 1 at Thames Ironworks ' Memorial Grounds ; their goal scorers were Hugh Goldie and Bert Banks . Millwall reached the 1899 – 1900 semi @-@ final and lost 3 – 0 to Southampton , but gained the nickname The Lions from a newspaper headline heralding them as " The Lions of the South " for their cup exploits . The teams ' second competitive meeting was a Southern League match that spanned two centuries . A fixture at the Memorial Grounds on 23 December 1899 was abandoned after 69 minutes owing to smog , with Millwall leading 2 – 0 . Instead of replaying the game , the remaining 21 minutes were completed after the return fixture four months later , on 28 April 1900 . After Ironworks won 1 – 0 , the players took a short rest and played the rest of the abandoned game . With no further score , Millwall won the game 2 – 0 . 
 Thames Ironworks was disbanded in June 1900 owing to disputes over the running of the club . The following month it was relaunched as West Ham United . The club 's nickname is The Hammers , owing to their Ironworks origins . In the 1901 – 02 and 1902 – 03 seasons , Millwall and West Ham competed in the Southern League , London League , Western League and Southern Professional Charity Cup . The two sides met seven times in each of these seasons , the highest number of meetings in a season between the clubs . During this period Millwall were unbeaten in 12 consecutive games against West Ham , with nine wins and three draws over two years . This included a 7 – 1 win in a Southern Professional Charity Cup semi @-@ final on 2 April 1903 , the largest winning margin between the teams . Ben Hulse scored four of the goals at the Memorial Grounds . The run was finally broken on 1 September 1904 , in a 3 – 0 victory at West Ham 's first ever game at Upton Park , with two goals from Billy Bridgeman and one by Jack Flynn . 
 On 17 September 1906 , in a Western League game , Millwall player Alf Dean was hurled against a metal advertising board by West Ham 's Len Jarvis . Others were stretchered off following heavy tackles . The East Ham Echo reported : " From the very first kick of the ball it was seen likely to be some trouble , but the storm burst when Dean and Jarvis came into collision ( Millwall had two players sent off during the match ) . This aroused considerable excitement among the spectators . The crowds on the bank having caught the fever , free fights were plentiful . " In 1910 Millwall decided to drop Athletic from their name and move out of East London . With limited expansion space on the Isle of Dogs , the club wanted to boost support and attendances . It moved four miles to The Den , in New Cross , South London . The last East London derby between the teams was at Millwall 's North Greenwich ground on 24 September 1910 ; West Ham won 2 – 0 with goals from Danny Shea and Fred Blackburn . Four months later , Millwall travelled to Upton Park as a South London team for the first time . The game ended in a 2 – 2 draw . On 9 March 1912 , 28 @,@ 400 supporters saw West Ham 's first visit to The Den . The Lions won the game 5 – 1 , with their Welsh international striker Wally Davis scoring a hat @-@ trick . 
 = = = Two World Wars and joining the Football League : 1915 – 45 = = = 
 A number of friendlies and non @-@ competitive derbies took place during the First and Second World Wars . In total , 33 matches were played between the teams in Wartime Leagues . They both fielded severely depleted sides of juniors , reserves and non @-@ professionals , playing 14 games in the London Combination between 1915 and 1919 . West Ham won nine , Millwall three and two were drawn . After the First World War , the Football League was reintroduced in England by The Football Association and West Ham joined the Second Division for the 1919 – 20 season . Millwall joined the inaugural Third Division in the 1920 – 21 season , in the Football League expansion of 44 clubs to 66 . In 1926 a general strike was observed by workers around the Royal Docks , the majority of whom were West Ham supporters . An unsubstantiated story states that Millwall @-@ supporting shipyard workers of the Isle of Dogs refused to lend their support , provoking outrage . ( At this time , Millwall had already moved away from the Isle of Dogs and were playing in New Cross . ) 
 Between 1919 and 1930 the clubs played each other 12 times in the London Professional Footballers Association Charity Fund , London Challenge Cup and the FA Cup . On 15 February 1930 , West Ham won the Fifth Round FA Cup game 4 – 1 at Upton Park ; Vic Watson scored two goals , and Viv Gibbins and Tommy <unk> one each . Harold Wadsworth replied for the Lions . The teams met for the first time in the Football League in the 1932 – 33 season , after West Ham were relegated from the First Division . On 17 September 1932 , West Ham beat Millwall 3 – 0 at Upton Park in the Second Division , two goals being scored by George Watson and one by Jackie Morton . 
 On 27 December 1938 , 42 @,@ 200 spectators at Upton Park saw a Second Division game between the sides end 0 – 0 . As of 2014 , this remains the record attendance for the fixture . Between 1939 and 1946 the two clubs played non @-@ competitive fixtures in the League South ( A ) Division , South Regional League , London League , Football League South and the Football League War Cup . They played 19 games against each other during the Second World War : Millwall won 3 , West Ham 12 and 4 were drawn . The Den was severely damaged by a German bomb in 1943 , and for a brief time Millwall were invited by their neighbours Charlton Athletic , Crystal Palace and West Ham to play their games at The Valley , Selhurst Park and Upton Park . To offset the shortage of professional players during the Second World War , a guest player system was introduced . Players such as Sailor Brown , Louis Cardwell and Jimmy Jinks played for both clubs during this period . West Ham lost 2 – 1 to Chelsea at White Hart Lane in the 1944 – 45 War Time Cup semi @-@ final , with two Millwall guest @-@ players in their team – both of whom went on to play for Millwall in the South Final , which they lost to Chelsea 2 – 0 . 
 = = = Different leagues and hooliganism : 1946 – 87 = = = 
 After the Second World War Millwall 's form was poor and the club dropped into the Third and Fourth Division of the Football League . West Ham have never played below the Second Division in their history and often played a league or two above Millwall . The two sides did not play each other competitively between 13 October 1959 and 7 October 1978 , making the 1960s the only decade the teams have not met . Despite the infrequency of their meetings , both sets of supporters still consider the other club their major rival . During these years , the Hammers enjoyed considerable success , winning the FA Cup in 1964 , 1975 and 1980 . They also won the European Cup Winners ' Cup in 1965 . Over four decades the sides were only in the same tier of the Football League for three seasons , in 1946 – 47 , 1947 – 48 and 1978 – 79 . They played two cup games against each other in the Southern Professional Floodlit Cup in 1959 and the Full Members Cup in 1987 . 
 Football hooliganism reached its height in the 1970s and 80s . West Ham 's Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers firm were at the forefront of the trouble , not just against each other , but against the police and firms associated with other football teams . In 1972 , the two clubs played each other in a testimonial match for Millwall defender Harry Cripps , who began his career at West Ham . The game was marred by intense fighting between the two club 's hooligan firms , both inside and outside the ground . Four years later , a Millwall supporter , Ian Pratt , died at New Cross railway station after falling out of a train during a fight with some West Ham fans . After the incident West Ham hooligans constructed the chant , " West Ham boys , we 've got brains , we throw Millwall under trains . " Millwall fans waited patiently for two years for revenge , until West Ham were relegated to the Second Division . Prior to their next meeting with the Hammers on 7 October 1978 , leaflets were distributed at Millwall 's home matches bearing the words : " A West Ham fan must die to avenge him . " The police responded with an unprecedented show of force for the game at Upton Park , which West Ham won 3 – 0 . Some 500 officers controlled the crowd , carrying out extensive searches and strict segregation . 
 The Lions ' 2 – 1 home league victory over the Hammers on 14 May 1979 ended a run of ten games without a win against their rivals , which stretched over 46 years , back to 1933 . Pop Robson had given West Ham a half @-@ time lead , but second half goals from Dave Mehmet and Nicky Chatterton gave Millwall the win . A 2 – 1 victory in the Full Members Cup on 10 November 1987 gave Millwall their first win at Upton Park in 73 years . Alan Dickens gave the Hammers the lead in the second half , but two goals in three minutes from Teddy Sheringham and Tony Cascarino assured Millwall of their first away win in the derby since 1914 . As of 2014 , it stands as the Lions last away win in the fixture .

 In 1988 Millwall won the Second Division championship and gained promotion , joining West Ham in the First Division for the first time in the club 's history . Paul Ince scored the only goal at The Den on 3 December 1988 , as West Ham won the game 1 – 0 . They also won 3 – 0 at home on 22 April 1989 , with goals from Julian Dicks , George Parris and Alan Dickens . This is the first and only time either side has completed a Football League double over the other . At the end of the season West Ham finished 19th and were relegated . Millwall finished 10th , the highest league finish in their history . The 1988 – 89 season is the only season both teams have been in the top division of English football . Millwall were relegated from the First Division in the 1989 – 90 season , the last time they appeared in the top tier . During the foundation of the Premier League in 1992 , the two teams competed the tier below in the newly formed First Division . The last game played between the teams at The Den was on 15 November 1992 . It was the featured Sunday game on The London Match , an LWT sports show . Millwall won the game 2 – 1 , with goals from Malcolm Allen and Phil Barber . Mark Robson replied for West Ham . 
 In the 1993 – 94 season , Millwall moved into the first purpose @-@ built all @-@ seater stadium , after the Taylor Report on the Hillsborough disaster . The Hammers were promoted , spending ten seasons in the Premier League and it was twelve years until they played at Millwall 's new ground , The New Den . On Mothering Sunday , 24 March 2004 , Millwall beat West Ham 4 – 1 , with two goals from Tim Cahill , one from Nick Chadwick and a Christian Dailly own goal . Marlon Harewood scored the West Ham goal . This is the largest winning margin between the sides in the Football League . In an eventful game , Millwall missed one penalty and had another saved by West Ham goalkeeper Stephen Bywater , who was subsequently sent off . Violence also broke out between the opposing fans . Millwall fans and the media named the match " The Mothers ' Day Massacre " . 
 During an open @-@ air showing in Canada Square , London Docklands of an England game in the 2006 World Cup against Paraguay , 100 West Ham and Millwall supporters fought each other , resulting in injuries to 16 people , one of whom required hospital treatment . The police shutdown the match screen although ten minutes of the game remained to be played . 
 = = = Upton Park riot and West Ham move stadiums : 2009 – present = = = 
 In the 2009 – 10 season Millwall were drawn away to West Ham in the League Cup , which was the first meeting between the teams in the competition . The police cut the number of tickets given to travelling Millwall fans from 3 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 500 , sparking anger among supporters ; Millwall warned police of a higher probability of trouble . West Ham won the game 3 – 1 on 25 August 2009 , their first win over Millwall in seven games played over in 18 years . Neil Harris had given Millwall the lead , but a goal from Junior Stanislas three minutes from the final whistle forced the game into extra @-@ time . Stanislas added another and <unk> Hines a third for the win . Violence marred the match before , during and after kick @-@ off , with multiple pitch invasions by Hammers supporters . Lions fan Alan Baker was stabbed outside the ground and suffered a punctured lung , but made a full recovery . He was one of 20 people injured . The police concluded that the violence , because of its large scale , was organised beforehand . The Football Association brought misconduct charges against both clubs . A disciplinary tribunal fined West Ham £ 115 @,@ 000 for " failing to ensure that their fans did not enter the field of play and refrained from violent , threatening , obscene and provocative behaviour " , but concluded that the allegations against Millwall of " violent , racist behaviour and throwing missiles or dangerous objects on to the pitch " had not been proved . 
 In a poor 2010 – 11 season , West Ham manager Avram Grant guided his team to only seven wins from 37 games . On 15 May 2011 , the Hammers were finally relegated from the Premier League after a 3 – 2 defeat at Wigan Athletic . As Wigan equalised at 2 – 2 , a light aircraft flew above Wigan 's ground , the DW Stadium , trailing a banner which read " Avram Grant – Millwall Legend " . Grant was sacked after the game . The plane had been hired by Millwall supporters from the fans ' website House of Fun , celebrating Grant 's failure to prevent West Ham 's relegation . Their relegation meant they met the Lions in the 2011 – 12 Football League Championship . On 17 September 2011 , their first league meeting for seven years ended in a 0 – 0 draw at The Den . The return fixture and most recent game between the two sides was on 4 February 2012 . West Ham beat Millwall 2 – 1 at Upton Park , despite having their captain Kevin Nolan sent off after only nine minutes for serious foul play . West Ham 's goal scorers were Carlton Cole and Winston Reid . Millwall 's goal was by Liam Trotter . 
 Fixtures between Millwall and West Ham United are currently categorised by the Metropolitan Police as category C – games which carry a high risk of disorder amongst supporters . For the 2011 – 12 season , the Metropolitan Police implemented London @-@ wide operations to ensure that the games passed by without any incident . In 2013 a member of West Ham 's hooligan Inter City Firm was jailed for 12 months for organising violence between West Ham and Millwall fans during an FA Cup match between Dagenham & Redbridge and Millwall on 7 January 2012 . He chose this game in the belief fewer police would be in attendance at a match in Dagenham , but who instead , turned out in force to prevent trouble . In November 2014 the two sides ' development squads were drawn against each other in the U21 Premier League Cup . The Metropolitan Police took preventative measures against any trouble occurring , demanding the game at Rush Green kick @-@ off at 12pm and be played behind closed doors . 
 Millwall and West Ham will move a mile closer and be under four miles ( 6 @.@ 23 km ) apart from the 2016 – 17 season , with the Hammers moving into the Olympic Stadium in Stratford , ending 112 years at Upton Park .

 Billy Bonds is the only manager to have managed both clubs . He was in charge of West Ham from February 1990 to August 1994 , managing the club for 227 games as the team yo @-@ <unk> between the First and Second divisions . He guided them to two promotions and one relegation . He resigned in August 1994 . He was appointed as Millwall manager in May 1997 by chairman Theo Paphitis — an unpopular decision with many Lions fans due to his West Ham allegiance . Bonds , from south London , had several family members who were Millwall fans ; a fact which meant some supporters felt he should be given a chance . After a good start , the team narrowly avoided relegation , finishing 18th in the Second Division . Bonds was sacked in May 1998 , having been in charge of the side for only 53 games . 
 Ted Fenton managed West Ham from 1950 – 61 and was responsible for the establishment of youth development at the club , the Academy of Football . He won the 1957 – 58 Second Division championship , assuring top @-@ flight football for the Hammers for the first time since 1932 . His brother Benny Fenton started his career as a player at West Ham in 1937 , before moving to Millwall in 1939 . After he retired as a footballer , he moved into management , managing Millwall from 1966 – 74 . On 17 January 1967 he was manager of the Lions team that established an English Football League record of 59 games unbeaten at home . The record was eventually taken by Liverpool in 1981 , who went 85 games unbeaten at Anfield in all competitions . 
 Pat Holland , an FA Cup winner in 1975 with West Ham , served as Millwall assistant manager to Willie Donachie in 2006 . After Donachie was fired in 2007 , he continued on as chief scout until 2009 . In June 2011 former Millwall player Sam Allardyce was appointed as manager of West Ham . In June 2013 Millwall appointed former Hammers captain Steve Lomas as their new manager . Lomas joined ex @-@ West Ham defender Tim <unk> , who was Millwall 's first @-@ team coach . As a former West Ham player , Lomas ' appointment was unpopular with many Millwall fans . Lomas was sacked on 26 December 2013 , after winning only five of his 22 games in charge . In May 2014 , former Millwall and West Ham player , Teddy Sheringham was appointed as an attacking coach with West Ham .

The Route 55 freeway serves as a main road through Cumberland and Gloucester counties , serving Millville , Vineland , and Glassboro . It is used as a commuter route north to Philadelphia and , along with Route 47 , as a route from the Delaware Valley to the Jersey Shore resorts in Cape May County . Built to Interstate Highway standards , New Jersey Route 55 has a posted speed limit of 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) for most of its length . 
 What is now Route 55 was originally proposed in the 1950s as a toll road called the Cape May Expressway that was to run from the Walt Whitman Bridge to Cape May . In 1962 , the New Jersey Expressway Authority was created to build the Cape May Expressway and the Atlantic City Expressway . However , by 1965 , the road to Cape May was turned over to the New Jersey Department of Transportation ( NJDOT ) and designated as Route 55 , which was to run from Westville to Cape May Court House . The first portion of the route opened around Millville in 1969 while the section bypassing Vineland was completed in the 1970s . Route 55 was completed north to Deptford in 1989 . 
 Meanwhile , the portion between Route 47 in Port Elizabeth and the Garden State Parkway in Middle Township was canceled in 1975 due to the impact the highway would have on the surrounding environment .

 Route 55 begins at a signalized intersection with Route 47 in the Port Elizabeth section of Maurice River Township , Cumberland County , heading to the north as a two @-@ lane undivided road through wooded areas . At the southern terminus , the road continues south as part of Route 47 . A short distance after beginning , the road widens into a four @-@ lane divided freeway and comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance with Schooner Landing Road . Past this interchange , Route 55 enters Millville and crosses over the Manantico Creek as it heads into built @-@ up areas . The freeway continues north to an interchange with Route 49 . 
 Past the Route 49 interchange , Route 55 continues through Millville , passing over County Route 552 Spur ( CR 552 Spur ) . The route passes to the east of <unk> , which also home to the Creative Glass Center of America , before turning northwest and crossing into Vineland , where it interchanges with CR 555 . 
 The freeway turns to the west past the CR 555 interchange and crosses over a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line before entering Millville again . At this point , the route comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with Route 47 adjacent to the Cumberland Mall . From Route 47 , the freeway enters forested areas again and makes a turn to the north , crossing back into Vineland . In Vineland , it interchanges with CR 552 near the South Jersey Health Care Regional Medical Center . This exit also serves Cumberland County College to the east . 
 Route 55 continues between rural areas near the Maurice River to the west and development to the east , coming to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 56 . Past this interchange , the route passes over a Winchester & Western Railroad line before crossing over CR 540 . Farther north , a modified cloverleaf interchange serves CR 674 ( Garden Road ) , which provides access to the northern part of Vineland . Past the Garden Road interchange , Route 55 continues through farmland and woodland , passing to the east of <unk> Airport . The freeway crosses Scotland Run and briefly runs through Pittsgrove Township in Salem County .

 Route 55 continues northwest into Franklin Township , Gloucester County , and reaches a cloverleaf interchange with U.S. Route 40 ( US 40 ) . Past this interchange , the freeway heads north , crossing over CR 538 . Route 55 comes to a diamond interchange with Little Mill Road before entering Clayton and turning to the west . A short distance later , Route 55 continues into Elk Township and comes to an interchange with CR 553 . 
 The route continues north into Glassboro , where it has an interchange with CR 641 . Past this interchange , Route 55 crosses into Harrison Township and meets US 322 and CR 536 at a cloverleaf interchange . US 322 heads east into Glassboro and serves Rowan University . 
 Past the US 322 interchange , the freeway continues through agricultural areas and enters Mantua Township , where it turns northeast and crosses under CR 553 Alternate . Route 55 passes under a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line before intersecting CR 553 again at a modified cloverleaf interchange . This interchange provides access to The Broadway Theatre of Pitman . 
 Past CR 553 , the route turns north again and passes near more suburban surroundings , briefly entering Washington Township before crossing into Deptford Township . In Deptford Township , Route 55 comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 47 . Northbound Route 47 heads toward the main campus of Rowan College at Gloucester County in Sewell . It crosses CR 534 before coming to a trumpet interchange with Deptford Center Road that provides access to CR 621 and the Deptford Mall . Past this interchange , Route 55 passes under CR 544 and CR 621 before merging onto Route 42 and coming to an end . 
 = = History = = 
 Following the completion of the Walt Whitman Bridge in the 1950s , two toll expressways were proposed to connect the bridge to Atlantic City and to Cape May . In 1962 , the New Jersey Expressway Authority Act was signed into law . This act created the New Jersey Expressway Authority , which was to manage both the Atlantic City and Cape May expressways . 
 While the Atlantic City Expressway was completed by the authority in 1965 , the Cape May Expressway was turned over to the state about this time . The Cape May Expressway was designated Route 55 and legislated to run from US 130 in Westville to US 9 near Cape May Court House . This proposed freeway was projected to cost $ 90 million ( equivalent to $ 676 million in 2016 ) and be completed in 1975 . 
 In 1969 , the first segment of Route 55 opened between Maurice River Township and the Vineland @-@ Millville border , connecting to Route 47 at both ends . In the 1970s , the planned northern terminus of Route 55 was moved to Route 42 in Deptford . The portion of Route 55 between Route 47 in Millville and US 40 in Franklin Township was completed in the mid @-@ 1970s while the portion between US 40 and Route 42 was completed in October 1989 . The Route 55 freeway has been instrumental in bringing economic development to southern New Jersey . The most common use of the highway is as a commuting route northward to Philadelphia . Following its completion , residential development in the southern part of Gloucester County has increased . 
 While the freeway was under construction in 1983 , it was discovered that it ran through Native American burial grounds in Deptford . This revelation led to unsuccessful lawsuits to cease construction of the route . After the lawsuits , a couple of incidents happened to construction workers , including a construction worker being run over by an asphalt truck , another being blown off a bridge by strong winds , and a van carrying five construction workers randomly erupting into flames . 
 Meanwhile , the portion of freeway south of Route 47 in Maurice River Township was not yet built . In 1972 , NJDOT wanted to provide adequate access to the Cape May Peninsula by extending the freeway southeast from the current terminus to the Garden State Parkway in Middle Township . NJDOT conducted an environmental study on this proposal in 1975 . The route was projected to cost $ 155 million ( equivalent to $ 682 million in 2016 ) and be finished by 1995 . Plans resurfaced for a southern extension in 1993 when a feasibility study was conducted to see if the extension of Route 55 could be built . This study , which estimated the extension would cost between $ 423 million and $ 483 million ( equivalent to $ 693 million and $ 791 million in 2016 ) , concluded that the road should not be built because it crossed too many wetlands . 
 The Route 55 freeway , like many other highways in New Jersey , once had solar @-@ powered emergency call boxes every mile ( about 1 @.@ 6 km ) ; the use of the call boxes became limited due to the increasing popularity of cell phones . To save on maintenance costs , NJDOT removed these call boxes in 2005 . 
 Despite the fact that the southern extension was held up for decades , it was revisited due to the disturbing images of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005 in the Gulf states . Route 55 could have been extended in order to provide a proper evacuation route for Cape May Peninsula and surrounding area . In addition , traffic jams along Route 47 during the summer also led to a possible revival of the proposal . There were efforts and studies to consider finishing the remaining 20 miles ( 32 km ) of the missing freeway . 
 In 2009 , State Senator Jeff Van Drew introduced a plan for an extension of Route 55 into Cape May County where the South Jersey Transportation Authority would build the road . In order to reduce the impact on the environment , the freeway would have been elevated . The extension of Route 55 would have been tolled . This effort followed two years of failed attempts for a feasibility study to relieve traffic on Route 47 . 
 However , all of these efforts faced considerable environmental opposition , which has been successful in blocking these plans , which were estimated to cost as much as $ 2 billion .

 In 1975 , the Delaware River Port Authority proposed that a Port Authority Transit Corporation ( PATCO ) rail line be added along the median of Route 55 between Deptford and Glassboro ; however , plans were canceled . In the 2000s , another proposal resurfaced to add a PATCO line along the Route 55 corridor . The alternative called for park and ride lots to be constructed along the Route 55 corridor , providing access to the line . Phase I would have run to Glassboro ( Rowan University ) and Phase II would have extended down to the Millville area and service the Cumberland Mall area . 
 New Jersey Governor Jon S. Corzine and the Delaware River Port Authority announced a comprehensive transportation plan for South Jersey on May 12 , 2009 . This plan would introduce express bus service along the Route 55 freeway and the adjacent Route 42 freeway . It would also include a diesel light rail line between Camden and Glassboro via Woodbury over an existing railroad right @-@ of @-@ way ( as opposed to the expanded PATCO line via Route 55 ) , improvements to New Jersey Transit 's Atlantic City Line , and enhanced connections to the Atlantic City International Airport .

 = Yogo sapphire = 
 Yogo sapphires are a variety of corundum found only in Yogo Gulch , part of the Little Belt Mountains in Judith Basin County , Montana , United States , on land once inhabited by the Piegan Blackfeet people . Yogos are typically cornflower blue , a result of trace amounts of iron and titanium . They have high uniform clarity and maintain their brilliance under artificial light . Because Yogo sapphires occur within a vertically dipping resistive igneous dike , mining efforts have been sporadic and rarely profitable . It is estimated that at least 28 million carats ( 5 @.@ 6 t or 5 @.@ 5 long tons or 6 @.@ 2 short tons ) of Yogos are still in the ground . Jewelry containing Yogos was given to First Ladies Florence Harding and Bess Truman ; in addition , many gems were sold in Europe , though promoters ' claims that Yogos are in the crown jewels of England or the engagement ring of Princess Diana are dubious . Today , several Yogo sapphires are part of the Smithsonian Institution 's gem collection . 
 Yogo sapphires were not initially recognized or valued . Gold was discovered at Yogo Creek in 1866 , and though " blue pebbles " were noticed alongside gold in the stream alluvium by 1878 , it was not until 1894 that the " blue pebbles " were recognized as sapphires . Sapphire mining began in 1895 after a local rancher named Jake Hoover sent a cigar box of gems he had collected to an assay office , which in turn sent them to Tiffany 's in New York , where an appraiser pronounced them " the finest precious gemstones ever found in the United States " . Hoover then purchased the original mother lode from a <unk> , later selling it to other investors . This became the highly profitable " English Mine " , which flourished from 1899 until the 1920s . A second operation , the " American Mine " , was owned by a series of investors in the western section of the Yogo dike , but was less profitable and bought out by the syndicate that owned the English Mine . In 1984 , a third set of claims , known as the Vortex mine , opened . 
 The term " Yogo sapphire " is the preferred wording for gems found in the Yogo Gulch , whereas " Montana sapphire " generally refers to gems found in other Montana locations . More gem @-@ quality sapphires are produced in Montana than anywhere else in North America . Sapphires were first discovered in Montana in 1865 , in alluvium along the Missouri River . Finds in other locations in the western half of the state occurred in 1889 , 1892 , and 1894 . The Rock Creek location , near Phillipsburg , is the most productive site in Montana , and its gems inspired the name of the nearby Sapphire Mountains . In 1969 , the sapphire was co @-@ designated along with the agate as Montana 's state gemstones . 
 In the early 1980s , Intergem Limited , which controlled most of the Yogo sapphire mining at the time , rocked the gem world by marketing Yogos as the world 's only guaranteed " untreated " sapphire , exposing a practice of the time wherein 95 percent of all the world 's sapphires were heat @-@ treated to enhance their natural color . Although Intergem went out of business , the gems it mined appeared on the market through the 1990s because the company had paid its salesmen in sapphires during its financial demise . Citibank had obtained a large stock of Yogos as a result of Intergem 's collapse , and after keeping them in a vault for nearly a decade , sold its collection in 1994 to a Montana jeweler . Mining activity today is largely confined to hobby miners in the area ; the major mines are currently inactive .

 Yogo sapphires are mined in Montana at Yogo Gulch ( 46 ° 50 ′ 45 ″ N 110 ° 18 ′ 38 ″ W ) , which is in Judith Basin County , Montana , 12 miles ( 19 km ) southwest of Utica , 45 miles ( 72 km ) west @-@ southwest of Lewistown , and east of Great Falls . The site was in Fergus County when Yogo sapphires were discovered , but in 1920 , because of the re @-@ designation of county boundaries , Judith Basin County was carved out from parts of western Fergus County and eastern Cascade County . 
 Yogo Gulch and the corresponding natural features of Yogo Peak ( 8 @,@ 625 feet ( 2 @,@ 629 m ) ) , Yogo Creek , and the Yogo dike , where the gems are mined , are all in the Little Belt Mountains within Judith Basin County . The Gulch is located along the lower reaches of Yogo Creek and west of the Judith River . The west end of the Yogo dike outcrops just southwest of Yogo Creek , about 3 miles ( 5 km ) north of Yogo Creek 's confluence with the Middle Fork of the Judith River ; from there it runs east @-@ northeast and ends about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 800 m ) from the Judith River . Yogo Creek starts just south of Yogo Peak , which is about 15 miles ( 24 km ) west of the Judith River . From there the creek flows southeast into the Middle Fork of the Judith River . The Judith River then flows northeast from the Little Belts toward Utica . East of the Judith River is Pig @-@ Eye Basin , where Jake Hoover , credited as the person who discovered Yogo sapphires , owned a ranch . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 Because Yogo Gulch lies in a region historically inhabited by the Piegan Blackfeet people , promoters of Yogo sapphires claim that <unk> may mean " romance " or " blue sky " in the Blackfoot language , although there is little evidence to support this claim . Other meanings for <unk> have been suggested , including " Going over the hill " . The meaning of the word " Yogo " had been lost by 1878 , when placer gold was found in Yogo Creek . Thus , its true meaning is uncertain . 
 = = Mineralogy and geology = = 
 Sapphires are a color variety of corundum , a crystalline form of aluminium oxide ( Al 
 2O 
 3 ) . Corundum is one of the hardest minerals , rating 9 on the Mohs scale . Corundum gems of most colors are called sapphires , except for red ones , which are called rubies . The term " Yogo sapphire " refers only to sapphires from the Yogo Gulch . The cornflower blue color of the Yogo results from trace amounts of iron and titanium . Yogo sapphires are unique in that they are free of cavities and inclusions , have high uniform clarity , lack color zoning , and do not need heat treating because their cornflower blue coloring is uniform and deep . Unlike Asian sapphires , they maintain their brilliance in artificial light . Yogos present an advantage to gemcutters : since they are found as primary constituent minerals within an igneous bedrock rather than in sedimentary alluvial deposits where most other sapphires are located , they retain a perfect or near perfect crystalline shape , making cutting much easier , as does their lack of inclusions , color zoning , or cloudiness . Yogos also exhibit a triangular pattern on the basal plane of the flattened crystals , with thin rhombohedral crystal faces , a feature absent in sapphires from other parts of Montana . 
 Yogos tend to be beautiful , small , and very expensive . The United States Geological Survey and many gem experts have stated that Yogos are " among the world 's finest sapphires . " The roughs tend to be small and flat , so cut Yogo gems heavier than 2 carats ( 0 @.@ 40 g ) are rare . Only about 10 percent of cut pieces are over 1 carat ( 0 @.@ 20 g ) . The largest recorded Yogo rough , found in 1910 , weighed 19 carats ( 3 @.@ 8 g ) and was cut into an 8 @-@ carat ( 1 @.@ 6 g ) gem . The largest cut Yogo is 10 @.@ 2 @-@ carat ( 2 @.@ 04 g ) . Because of the rarity of large rough Yogo sapphires , Yogo gem prices begin rising sharply when they are over 0 @.@ 5 carats ( 0 @.@ 10 g ) , and skyrocket when they are over 1 carat ( 0 @.@ 20 g ) . 
 Montana sapphires in general come in a variety of colors , but Yogos are almost always blue . About two percent of Yogos are purple , due to trace amounts of chromium . A very small number of rubies have been found at Yogo Gulch . 
 Yogo sapphires were first discovered in alluvial streambed sediments during gold mining operations in Yogo Gulch downstream from the Yogo dike , but were later traced to their source within igneous bedrock . Worldwide , other than the Yogo Gulch deposit and one small site in the Kashmir region , most other corundum is mined from the sand and gravel created by the weathering of metamorphic rock . Alluvial sapphires are found in the Far East , Australia , and in three other Montana locations — the upper Missouri River , Rock Creek , and Dry Cottonwood Creek . The location of most Yogo sapphires within igneous rock rather than from alluvial placer deposits requires difficult hard rock mining . Coupled with American labor costs , this makes their extraction fairly expensive . At least 28 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 carats ( 5 @,@ 600 kg ) are estimated to still be in the ground . The Yogo dike is " the only known igneous rock from which sapphire is mined " . 
 The sapphire bearing Yogo dike is a dark gray to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre . The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica . The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix . The phlogopite crystals have been used to determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature ( 900 ° C ( 1 @,@ 650 ° F ) ) . The dike also contains fragments of other rock types . These xenoliths include pieces of limestone , clastic sedimentary rocks , and gneiss . In some locations , due to the abundance of xenoliths , the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix . One gneiss fragment found as a <unk> contains corundum . The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched , indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host , the lamprophyre magma . This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock , such as a corundum @-@ bearing gneiss , later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth . Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region . 
 The Yogo dike is a narrow <unk> sheet @-@ like igneous body . It varies from 2 to 26 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 to 7 @.@ 92 m ) thick and extends for 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) , striking at an azimuth of 255 ° . The dike is broken into three offset en echelon segments , and dates to 48 @.@ 6 mya using Ar dating on phlogopite . The dike intrudes Mississippian age ( 360 to 325 mya ) limestone and other sedimentary rocks of the Madison and Big Snowy Groups . 
 There has been considerable debate over the years as to the depth of the Yogo dike and how many ounces of rough sapphires per ton it contains . In the late 1970s and early 1980s , Delmer L. Brown , a geological engineer and gemologist , conducted the most thorough scientific exploration up to that time , concluding that the dike was at least 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) deep and that the concentration of rough sapphires was not constant throughout the deposit . Brown found that the dike had intruded into a pre @-@ existing fault that had been a conduit for groundwater circulation . The overlying shale , the <unk> Formation , was deposited on an unconformity , an ancient Mississippian @-@ age karst erosion surface , and was not intruded by the dike . This groundwater action produced collapsed zones which were intruded by the dike to form breccia zones . Recent erosion in the area removed the overlying shales and again exposed the limestone to groundwater action which produced collapse breccias which include fragments of the dike rock . He determined that the erosion of the dike in the current erosion cycle was minimal . 
 Brown also showed that the unique characteristics of the Yogo sapphires are related to their geological history . Most sapphires are formed under low pressure and temperature over geologically short periods of time , and this is why most non @-@ Yogo sapphires have imperfections and inconsistent coloring . Yogos show crystalline formation under very high temperatures and pressures corresponding to a great depth , over geologically long periods of time . Brown also showed that distribution of gem rough through the dike was not consistent , so using an average " ounces per ton " was misleading . For example , the section which , despite several ownership and name changes over the years , is generally known as the " American Mine , " was developed in an area dominated by post @-@ dike breccia with significantly lower ounces per ton than the English Mine . 
 = = Montana sapphires = = 
 " Yogo sapphire " is the preferred term for gems found in the Yogo Gulch , whereas " Montana sapphire " generally refers to gems found in other Montana locations . More gem @-@ quality sapphires are produced in Montana than anywhere else in North America . Montana sapphires come in a variety of colors , though rubies are rare . 
 The first sapphires found in the United States were discovered on May 5 , 1865 , along the Missouri River , about 14 miles ( 23 km ) east of Helena , in Lewis and Clark County , by Ed " Sapphire " Collins . Collins sent the sapphires to Tiffany 's in New York City , and to Amsterdam for evaluation ; however , those sapphires were of poor coloring and low overall quality , garnering little notice and giving Montana sapphires a poor reputation . Corundum was also found at Dry Cottonwood Creek near Butte in 1889 , Rock Creek near Philipsburg in 1892 , and Quartz Gulch near Bozeman in 1894 . By 1890 , the English @-@ owned Sapphire and Ruby Mining Company had bought several thousand acres of land where Montana sapphires were found , but the venture failed after a few years because of fraudulent practices by the owners . 
 Sapphires from these three sites are routinely heat @-@ treated to enhance color . While millions of carats of sapphires have been mined from the Missouri River deposits , there has been little commercial activity there since the 1990s because of the high cost of recovery and environmental concerns . Production at Dry Cottonwood Creek has been sporadic and low @-@ yielding . The Rock Creek area , also known as Gem Mountain , continues to be the most productive site in Montana , even more so than Yogo Gulch , producing over 190 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 carats ( 38 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 g ) of sapphires since its inception in 1906 . Other than Yogo , Montana sapphire mines have been less successful because they have few blue sapphires and non @-@ blue sapphires have low profit margins . 
 These gems inspired the names of features : the mountains near Rock Creek are known as the Sapphire Mountains . <unk> are also found at some Montana sapphire sites , inspiring the name of the Garnet Range , which lies to the north of the Sapphire Mountains . In 1969 , the sapphire and agate were jointly declared Montana 's two official state gemstones . 
 = = History = = 
 Mining of Yogo sapphires was exceptionally difficult and remains sporadic today . Even so , Yogo sapphire mining turned out to be more valuable than several gold strikes . The Yogo area also produced small amounts of silver , copper , and iron . 
 Yogo Gulch lies in a region originally inhabited by the Piegan Blackfeet people . Gold was first discovered at Yogo Creek in 1866 , but the small numbers of early prospectors were driven off by local Native Americans . During a Gold Rush in 1878 , about a thousand miners came to Yogo Creek , which was one of the gold @-@ bearing streams in Montana not yet actively mined . " Blue pebbles " were noted along with small quantities of gold . The mining camp at Yogo City only flourished for roughly three years , and eventually the population dwindled to only a few people . 
 Yogo City was briefly known as Hoover City , after Jake Hoover . Hoover was part of a partnership that had been placer mining for gold and is credited as the discoverer of Yogo Sapphires . For several years , he also owned a ranch in nearby Pig @-@ Eye Basin . He later prospected for gold in Alaska and was a deep @-@ sea fishing guide in Seattle before eventually returning to the Judith Basin . Western painter C.M. Russell arrived in the area in 1880 as a young <unk> and was hired by Hoover . Russell stated that he learned most of his frontier skills from Hoover , and the two men remained lifelong friends . Millie Ringold , a former slave born in 1845 , settled in Fort Benton , Montana after having worked as a nurse and servant for an army general . When gold was discovered at Yogo Creek , Ringold sold her boarding house in Fort Benton and left for the Yogo gold fields , setting up a hotel , restaurant , and saloon in Yogo City where she sang and played music . Ringold later cooked for the English mine , but also worked her own gold claims , even after gold mining was on the decline . She was known as a superb cook and ultimately died in Yogo City in 1906 , the last resident of the community . The nearby town of Utica was featured in Russell 's 1907 painting A Quiet Day In Utica , which was originally known as <unk> a Dog . Hoover , Ringold , store owner Charles Lehman , and Russell himself are all depicted in the painting , placed between the hitching post and door of the general store .

 In 1894 , the " blue pebbles " were recognized as sapphires . One story credits a local school teacher for recognizing the blue pebbles as sapphires . A variation is that the teacher lived in Maine , but was a friend of a local miner , who had mailed her a small box with some gold and a few " blue pebbles " in it . Another story credits a miner named S.S. Hobson for surmising that the blue stones might be sapphires , and his guess was confirmed by a jeweler in Helena . Ultimately , in 1895 , Jake Hoover sent a cigar box containing those he had collected while mining gold to an assay office , which in turn sent them via regular , uninsured mail to Tiffany 's in New York City for appraisal by Dr. George Frederick Kunz , the leading American gemologist of the time . Impressed by their quality and color , Kunz pronounced them " the finest precious gemstones ever found in the United States " . Tiffany 's sent Hoover a check for $ 3 @,@ 750 ( approximately $ 106 @,@ 700 as of 2016 ) , along with a letter that described the blue pebbles as " sapphires of unusual quality " .

 Yogos were ultimately traced from the alluvium to their source . In February 1896 , a <unk> named Jim Ettien found the sapphire mother lode : the Yogo dike . Ettien was prospecting for gold , and found sapphires after washing gravel he found in a fissure within a limestone outcrop . Ettien staked two claims . The vein turned out to be 5 miles ( 8 km ) long and several other miners promptly staked claims along it . Ettien sold his claims to Hoover ; Hoover in turn sold his interest in eight original mining stakes , known as the " New Mine Sapphire Syndicate " , to his two partners for $ 5 @,@ 000 ( approximately $ 140 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) . This site was 5 miles ( 8 km ) from Yogo City . In 1899 , Johnson , Walker and Tolhurst , Ltd. of London purchased the New Mine Sapphire Syndicate for $ 100 @,@ 000 ( approximately $ 2 @.@ 8 million as of 2016 ) . At that point , the operation became unofficially known as the " English Mine " . 
 On July 4 , 1896 , two other Americans , John Burke and Pat Sweeney , staked six mining claims on the western portion of the Yogo dike — areas Hoover had deemed unfit for mining . These claims were collectively known as the " Fourth of July Claim " , and became known as the " American Mine " . In 1904 , the mine was bought by the American Gem Syndicate , and it sold in 1907 to the American Sapphire Company . 
 One of the Englishmen who came to the area was Charles Gadsden of Berkhamsted , Hertfordshire . By 1902 , Gadsden was promoted to resident supervisor of the English Mine , and he quickly turned its focus from gold to sapphires . Gadsden 's security measures were very tight , as weight @-@ for @-@ weight , rough sapphires were and continue to be worth much more than gold . The English Mine flourished until the 1920s , but floods on July 26 , 1923 , so severely damaged the mines that they never fully recovered . Between the aftermath of flooding and hard economic times , the English Mine finally failed in 1929 . It had recovered more than 16 million carats ( 3 @.@ 2 t ) of rough sapphires that produced 2 @.@ 5 million carats ( 500 kg ) of finished gems valued at $ 25 million in 1929 dollars ( approximately $ 340 million as of 2016 ) . A series of other firms mined sapphires there , but with marginal success . For much of the 1930s and 1940s Gadsden worked the mine alone and used his own money to pay its property taxes . He remained caretaker of the mines until shortly before his death on March 11 , 1954 . 
 The American Mine operations were less profitable than those of the English Mine . While the English Mine used superior mining and management techniques on a richer lode , the American Mine suffered from insufficient space and lack of water for ore weathering . <unk> from the English Mine were shipped to London and sold in Europe , often with claims they were sapphires from the Far East , while the American Mine had difficulty marketing its gems within the United States . The American Sapphire Company , which used local gemcutters from Great Falls , went bankrupt in 1909 ; a new firm , the Yogo American Sapphire Company , bought the American Mine , but was bankrupt by 1913 . Gadsden and his wife had convinced the New Mine Sapphire Syndicate to buy out the Yogo American Sapphire Company in 1914 , and in doing so , the English syndicate gained control of all known Yogo deposits . They quickly recouped the purchase price by washing the tailings left behind by previous operators of the American Mine .

 Montana sapphires were heavily mined during World War II for industrial abrasive and cutting purposes . However , because the Yogo mines were still owned by the English , the United States government could not control those operations , so the mines were little affected by the war , even though industrial sapphires were critical to the war effort . The Yogo Sapphire Mining Corporation of Billings , Montana , was the next company to try to run the English Mine . They made an initial offer in 1946 , and reached a deal by 1949 . However , the purchase was not complete until 1956 because of legal issues . The sale was finally completed for $ 65 @,@ 000 cash and some stock considerations because the company 's capital was exhausted , similar to previous Yogo ventures . The Yogo Sapphire Mining Corporation then changed its name to be the same as the former English firm 's name : New Mine Sapphire Syndicate . It became informally known as the " American Syndicate " to distinguish it from the previous " English Syndicate " . Production was poor and mining ceased in September 1959 . From 1959 to 1963 , the mine itself was left unattended and unsecured , resulting in hobbyists , picnickers , and <unk> ' coming from all over the US and Canada to gather loose rough sapphires . The American Syndicate took action to stop this in 1963 , with fences and threats of prosecution . The American Syndicate then tried leasing the mine to several operators . One of these was Siskon , Inc. of Nevada , which lost a significant amount of money . They sued , and in May 1965 the Montana Supreme Court ruled in Siskon 's favor . Siskon bought the mine at a sheriff 's sale and in turn leased it to a group headed by Arnold Baron , who had a background in <unk> and jewelry . Baron organized German and Thai gemcutters and had success in marketing Yogos in America — the first such success in 50 years . However , owing to the difficulty in mining the hard rock site , he did not exercise his option to buy the mine , and Siskon sold it in August 1968 to Herman <unk> of Oxnard , California , for $ 585 @,@ 000 . 
 In 1969 , <unk> ' Sapphire Village , Inc. created the Sapphire Village , a nearby homesite development offering buyers limited mining rights to gather their own sapphires with hand tools . Having done no significant mining or marketing , Sapphire Village , Inc. sold in 1973 to one of its investors , Chikara Kunisaki , a celery farmer from Oxnard , California . Kunisaki renamed the business Sapphire International Corporation and attempted to create a commercial mining operation . He built a modern 3 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 910 m ) tunnel at the site of the old American Mine , named the " Kunisaki Tunnel " . But operation costs were so high that Sapphire International Corporation shut down in late 1976 . This was the last actual attempt to mine the American Mine section of the Yogo dike , and today , only the locked portal to the tunnel still exists . 
 In January 1977 , Victor di Suvero and his firm Sapphire @-@ Yogo Mines became the next owner to tackle the Yogo dike . Di Suvero was a native @-@ born Italian who grew up in Tientsin , China , and had been successful with a jade mine in California . Di Suvero 's expertise was in marketing : he formed a company called Sapphire Trading to cut and market the Yogos . He had novel marketing ideas but was not knowledgeable about the mining side of the business . Unable to make payments , his venture folded in late 1979 . 
 By 1980 , only four American owners had been successful at Yogo Gulch , all early in its mining history . The English syndicate had been the most profitable of any venture , and even that venture was short @-@ lived . At least thirteen American @-@ owned Yogo mining efforts had failed . Besides inherent difficulties with financing and the challenges of hard rock mining , the American owners generally did not understand how to effectively market the gems . 
 = = = 1980s and beyond = = = 
 Kunisaki put his mine up for sale , asking $ 6 million to recoup his expenses . Even though mine profits had been poor over the decades , prices of precious gems were very high at the time due to the worldwide oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s . Four individuals or groups seriously considered Kunisaki 's offer . Relying heavily upon Delmer Brown 's expertise , Harry C. Bullock and J. R. Edington formed the limited partnership American Yogo Sapphire Limited , becoming the 14th American company to work the Yogo dike . Bullock and Brown had Yogo mine experience , as they had worked with di Suvero . Bullock 's plan included mining , cutting , making jewelry , and marketing — the whole spectrum of the business . They paid the $ 6 million asked by Kunisaki and then raised another $ 7 @.@ 2 million in funding by October 1981 . Brown located quality gemcutters in Thailand , and set up the American Yogo Sapphire Company there . Brown also set up a thorough , computerized security system that tracked gems from the mine to the gemcutters . Bigger roughs were sent to American cutters , specialty cuts were done in Germany , a few cuts were done in Hong Kong , and the vast majority were done in Thailand . American Yogo Sapphire Limited secured a $ 5 million line of credit with Citibank . Desiring a more modern name , American Yogo Sapphire Limited changed its name to Intergem Limited in early 1982 . Intergem marketed the Yogo as the " Royal American Sapphire . " Their first line of jewelry appeared in mid @-@ 1982 , first marketed regionally in the American west and later at the national level . Intergem also developed a system of authorized dealers , and found success in its first four years , with sales over $ 3 million in 1984 alone . 
 Intergem rocked the gem trade by marketing the Yogo as the world 's only guaranteed untreated sapphire . By 1982 , the practice of routinely heat treating gems had become a major issue in the industry . At the time , 95 percent of all the world 's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color . Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires , known as <unk> , and heated them to an artificial blue . A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time , though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95 percent accuracy . Intergem 's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry . In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated . Intergem 's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch . 
 Intergem began planning to dig even deeper into the Yogo dike , which held more known reserves than all the world 's other known sapphire deposits combined , albeit deep underground rather than near the surface in the manner of the other known deposits . They also set up a washing plant and maintenance sheds at the site of the former American mine . Intergem had made a $ 1 @.@ 5 million down payment and agreed to make semi @-@ annual payments to Kunisaki 's Sapphire International Corporation , which had been renamed to Roncor . Intergem also had loan and interest payments on the $ 7 @.@ 2 million loan to make to Citibank . While the company 's sales were steadily increasing , their profits were still too low and in May 1985 they missed a $ 250 @,@ 000 payment to Roncor . Simultaneously , their collateral of gems , held by Citibank , declined because the value of their collateral was declining ; as a result , Citibank called in its loan . Intergem had over $ 1 million in sales lined up for the 1985 Christmas season , but could only fill a tiny portion because they did not have enough operating capital to manufacture the Yogo jewelry . In mid @-@ 1986 , Roncor regained full ownership even though Intergem had sold loose gems and jewelry worth millions of dollars . 
 Various companies attempted to lease the mine from Roncor , but in the meantime , two local couples , Lanny and Joy Perry and Chuck and Marie Ridgeway , discovered a new site at Yogo Gulch in January 1984 by following a trail to an unused section of the dike that had previously been deemed unsuitable . They began mining the site and named it the " Vortex Mine " , forming a company named Vortex Mining . The mine shaft was 280 feet ( 85 m ) deep and contained two Yogo ore @-@ bearing veins . The portion of the dike they had mined was an extension of the main dike . The Vortex Mine , renamed Yogo Creek Mining , was successful for years but eventually declined and closed in 2004 . 
 In 1992 , Roncor found an 11 @-@ carat ( 2 @.@ 2 g ) rough . <unk> Exploration , operating as the Yogo Sapphire Project , signed a 22 @-@ month lease with Roncor in March 1993 and had some success in the middle and eastern portions of the dike ; it decided not to continue after the end of its lease due to the cost of underground mining , depletion of easily accessible Yogos , and the relatively small size of Yogos then easily accessible . During this time , additional dikes were found in the area using geophysical magnetometer surveys . Low @-@ grade sapphire rough was found in the Eastern Flats Dike , a parallel dike some 500 feet northeast of the main dike . Pacific Cascade Sapphires , a Canadian company , had a mining lease with Roncor in 2000 and 2001 but ran out of funds and their option expired . By this time , most of the easily accessible Yogos had been mined and miners had to dig deeper , further increasing costs . 
 In 1995 , Intergem 's stock of gems began to reappear on the market because the company had paid its salesmen in sapphires during its financial demise . After Intergem collapsed , many of its salesmen continued to sell Yogos , especially after <unk> ceased operations . Citibank also had obtained a large stock of Yogos , reputedly worth $ 3 @.@ 5 million ( approximately $ 7 @,@ 700 @,@ 600 as of 2016 ) , as a result of Intergem 's collapse : 200 @,@ 000 carats ( 40 @,@ 000 g ) of rough , 22 @,@ 000 carats ( 4 @,@ 400 g ) of cut gems , and 2 @,@ 000 pieces of jewelry , all of which sat in the bank 's vaults until 1991 when <unk> Michelsen , director of the Center for Gemstone Evaluation and creator of the Michelsen Gemstone Index , became interested . In 1992 , he and Jim Adair , a Missoula , Montana , jeweler who is the world 's largest retailer of Yogos , got together , and by October 1994 Adair had purchased Citibank 's four sealed bags of Yogo material . However , only one of the bags was truly valuable . Adair and Michelsen designed custom cutting techniques for Yogos . 
 A new owner , Michael Duane Roberts , bought the Vortex Mine in 2008 . Its operations were designed to be environmentally friendly , using methods such as recycling all water and not using other chemicals . Roberts died in a mining accident in 2012 . As of 2011 , there was also mining activity by individual hobby miners on small parcels at Sapphire Village , but the Roncor mines remained inactive .

 Several Yogo sapphires are kept at the Smithsonian Institution . The earliest donations were noted in the museum 's annual report on June 30 , 1899 , when the institution reported that Dr. L. T. Chamberlain gave them two cut Yogos and 21 other sapphires for their Dr. Isaac Lea gem and mineral collection . The record @-@ setting 10 @.@ 2 @-@ carat ( 2 @.@ 04 g ) cut Yogo is also held by the Smithsonian . In 2006 , gemologist Robert Kane of Fine Gems International in Helena , which has the world 's largest selection of Montana sapphires , donated 333 Montana sapphires , weighing a total of 27 @.@ 07 carats ( 5 @.@ 414 g ) , to the Smithsonian 's Gem and Mineral Collection , along with 98 @.@ 48 grams of <unk> yellow gold for the creation of a piece of jewelry . A representative of the Smithsonian asked Paula Crevoshay , a jewelry designer from Albuquerque , New Mexico , to create a piece of finished jewelry from these gems . Crevoshay felt that a butterfly motif would best represent America 's natural beauty , honor her mother 's love of butterflies , and display the wide range of colors found in Montana sapphires . Crevoshay named the brooch " Conchita " in honor of her mother ; it is also referred to as the " Sapphire Butterfly Brooch " , " Conchita Sapphire Butterfly " , and the " Montana Butterfly Brooch " . Two of the sapphires used are cabochon cut and the rest are brilliant cut . The majority are from the Rock Creek deposit . The largest one , however , is a blue Yogo used for the butterfly 's head . Other sapphires used included yellow , purple , pink , and orange gems . Crevoshay completed the brooch in 2007 ; she and Kane presented the finished brooch to Smithsonian curator Jeffrey Post on May 7 , 2007 , in Washington , DC . 
 In the earliest years of Yogo sapphire mining , before Yogos achieved their own reputation , Oriental sapphires were sold in Montana with claims they were Yogos , while in Europe , Yogos were sold as Oriental sapphires . However , Yogos became notable in their own right . Paulding Farnham ( 1859 – 1927 ) used Yogos in several jewelry pieces he designed for the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris , where Yogo sapphires received a silver medal among all gems for color and clarity . An entry of uncut loose Yogo sapphires also won a bronze medal at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis , Missouri . Farnham was the creator of the most elaborate piece of jewelry ever made with Yogos , the life @-@ size Tiffany Iris Brooch , a brooch ornament , which contains 120 Yogo sapphires set in platinum , and sold on March 17 , 1900 , for $ 6 @,@ 906 @.@ 84 . In 1923 , First Lady Florence Harding was given an " all Montana " ring made from a Yogo sapphire and Montana gold . In 1952 , Gadsden gave cut Yogos to President Harry Truman , his wife Bess , and their daughter Margaret . Many Yogos were also sold in Europe , as some Yogo mining was conducted by British interests . Yogos may have been in the personal collections of some members of the British royal family in the 1910s , but promotional claims that Yogos are in any of the crown jewels of England cannot be conclusively proven or disproven . Claims that the gem in the engagement ring of Lady Diana Spencer and Kate Middleton is a Yogo are dubious ; the gem is thought to be of Sri Lankan origin . Its size also indicates it is unlikely to be a Yogo ; the sapphire is large , most often reported as being 9 carats ( 1 @.@ 8 g ) in size , though it has also been described as 12 carats ( 2 @.@ 4 g ) and even 18 carats ( 3 @.@ 6 g ) , however , the latter number is the karat purity of the gold setting . The story that the gem is a Yogo can be traced to a 1984 Los Angeles Times article that described the ring as a 9 @-@ carat ( 1 @.@ 8 g ) sapphire , and quoted Intergem president Dennis Brown 's claim that the gem may have come from a British @-@ owned Yogo mine . 
 = Gunnersbury Triangle = 
 Gunnersbury Triangle is a 2 @.@ 57 @-@ hectare ( 6 @.@ 4 @-@ acre ) Local nature reserve in the London boroughs of Ealing and Hounslow , immediately to the east of Gunnersbury . It was saved when , for the first time in Britain , a public inquiry in 1983 ruled that a planned development of the land could not go ahead because of its value for nature . It opened as a nature reserve in 1985 . 
 The area consists mainly of secondary birch woodland , with some locally uncommon willow carr or wet woodland and a small area of acid grassland along the track of the former Acton curve railway . The reserve supports a varied population of plants , birds , amphibians , insects and other wildlife . It is managed by the London Wildlife Trust . 
 The reserve has free admission . It is maintained by London Wildlife Trust staff with the help of volunteers . There is a varied programme of activities including wildlife walks , fungus forays , open days and talks . The reserve is used regularly by school and community groups , and for team @-@ building work days by corporate groups . Its entrance , with a wooden five @-@ bar gate flanked by hedges , is on the south of Bollo Lane , a few yards from Chiswick Park tube station . 
 = = History = = 
 The area is shown on 19th @-@ century maps as orchards and gravel quarries . The triangular area now occupied by the reserve was delineated by three railway lines , two belonging to the District Line ( now part of London Underground 's sub @-@ surface lines ) , and the now defunct London and South Western Railway ( LSWR ) . There was once a bridge into the triangle from the west , and in the 1940s it was used as railway allotments ( vegetable gardens ) , but when London Transport 's Acton Works was built , the bridge was abandoned . The area , thus disused , was colonised naturally by grasses and trees in a " secondary succession " . 
 In 1981 , the site was proposed for commercial development , provoking an energetic campaign by the Chiswick Wildlife Group , formed in March 1982 , which became the local branch of the London Wildlife Trust . The threat to the site was one of the first to be highlighted by the London Wildlife Trust on its formation in October 1981 . The campaign led to a Public Inquiry in July 1983 , which determined that the site should be devoted to nature conservation . This was the first time anywhere in the United Kingdom that a Public Inquiry had ruled in favour of nature in a city , and the Gunnersbury Triangle example became a test case . 
 According to the New Scientist , writing in 1985 , " the celebrated Gunnersbury Triangle – an undisturbed piece of woodland surrounded by railways including the District Line .. was bought and preserved by Hounslow borough from British Rail with a GLC grant of £ 58 000 . The GLC also gave expert ecological advice when Hounslow council contested a public inquiry to save the Triangle . " 
 The London Wildlife Trust has managed the Gunnersbury Triangle on behalf of the London Borough of Hounslow since 1985 . The London Borough of Hounslow formally designated the Gunnersbury Triangle as a Local Nature Reserve in 1987 . The London Borough of Ealing formally designated the part of the Gunnersbury Triangle that lies in Ealing as a Local Nature Reserve in 1991 . 
 In 1993 , recalling the dramatic events , the President of the London Natural History Society , David Bevan said : 
 On November 19th 1987 , ... The Gunnersbury Triangle was declared by Hounslow Council . The circumstances that led up to this important declaration are vividly described in David Goode 's book . This was emphatically not a rural site . It was surrounded on all three sides by railway lines and had only been in existence for a mere forty years . " 
 Bevan quoted Goode as saying " It had none of the features which , in traditional nature conservation terms , would make it a place worth preserving " , going on to explain this remark as follows : 
 Nevertheless , the woodland that had grown up on it provided the only genuinely wild place for miles around and it was greatly cherished by local people . British Rail , who owned the site , had applied for planning permission to put up warehousing over the whole of the triangle . This was refused by Hounslow Council and a public inquiry followed in 1983 . The Inspector ruled that the development should not be allowed because of the considerable local ecological value . 
 In 2016 , the Triangle 's volunteers won an RE : LEAF Acorn Award for their " particular contribution to promoting or conserving trees " .

 Gunnersbury Triangle is a classic " railway triangle " , the 2 @.@ 57 @-@ hectare ( 6 @.@ 4 @-@ acre ) space in between three curving railway lines . To the west is the Richmond branch of the London Overground ; to the south , the District line ; and to the northeast , the disused track of the London and South Western Railway ( there remains the Piccadilly line a little further north , crossing Bollo lane ) . Much of the area is now wooded . It is a Local Nature Reserve and a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation .

 The following compartments are identified in the reserve 's management plan : 
 Compartment 1 : Secondary birch woodland 
 This covers most of the reserve . Silver birch is dominant , with a few crack willow , goat willow , some wild cherry and sycamore in the canopy . Shrubs include hawthorn , elder , holly , yew and rowan , with garden escapes like <unk> , Oregon grape , cotoneaster , privet . There are some saplings of pedunculate oak , mostly around the edge , and holm oak . The field layer is mainly thick bramble , with ivy in denser shade . Ferns include male fern , broad buckler fern and the less common lady fern . 
 Compartment 2 : Secondary willow woodland 
 Willow carr ( locally uncommon wet woodland including the " mangrove swamp " ) with goat willow , grey willow , and some crack willow , with hybrids . The shrubs and field layer are similar to compartment 1 ; there is some honeysuckle and common <unk> , hemlock water dropwort , gypsywort , yellow flag , pendulous sedge . 
 Compartment 3 : Eastern bank and hedgerow 
 Rough grassland with false oat @-@ grass , Yorkshire fog , yarrow , cat 's ear , with bracken at the south end . There is an uneven hedge of hawthorn and buckthorn . The sunny south @-@ west aspect encourages butterflies including holly blue , Essex skipper and small skipper .

 The Gunnersbury Triangle is regularly visited by school parties , totalling some 1500 students per year , mainly in the summer when they can work outside . They study grassland , woodland and pond ecology . 
 According to the TES ( formerly the Times Educational Supplement ) , " From April , holly blue , peacock and brimstone butterflies abound . Following the illustrated guide , you wind among wild cherry and rowan , under archways of hazel branches to a pond where damsel @-@ flies dance in early summer . A sparrow @-@ hawk nests in a silver birch , a jay comes visiting , bees and wood @-@ mice also live here . " The TES continues : " There are open glades for picnics and , in autumn , blackberries to gather . The aim here is to manage the woodland as a natural piece of countryside in town , and if , from time to time , you glimpse a tube train , you hardly notice it , beyond the trees . " 
 The reserve is open to the public . The London Wildlife Trust runs guided visits such as Fungus <unk> and wildlife walks every year . On open days , staff and volunteers organise activities to enable children and adults to learn more about nature conservation in a relaxed environment . 
 From time to time , companies provide teams of volunteers to work for a day on tasks such as clearing scrub and repairing paths and fences . 
 The London Wildlife Trust 's long @-@ term management objective for the site is " to manage the nature reserve to conserve its natural biodiversity , and to conserve its matrix of woodland , wetland and grassland habitats through appropriate management " , which includes coppicing , clearing scrub , mowing , and controlling invasion by non @-@ native species , while " preserving the feeling of ' wilderness ' " .

 = Tornado = 
 A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that rotates while in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or , in rare cases , the base of a cumulus cloud . They are often referred to as twisters or cyclones , although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name any closed low pressure circulation . Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes , but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust . Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour ( 180 km / h ) , are about 250 feet ( 80 m ) across , and travel a few miles ( several kilometers ) before dissipating . The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour ( 480 km / h ) , are more than two miles ( 3 km ) in diameter , and stay on the ground for dozens of miles ( more than 100 km ) . 
 Various types of tornadoes include the landspout , multiple vortex tornado , and waterspout . Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel @-@ shaped wind current , connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud . They are generally classified as non @-@ <unk> tornadoes that develop over bodies of water , but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes . These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator , and are less common at high latitudes . Other tornado @-@ like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado , dust devil , fire whirls , and steam devil ; downbursts are frequently confused with tornadoes , though their action is dissimilar . 
 Tornadoes have been observed and documented on every continent except Antarctica . However , the vast majority of tornadoes occur in the Tornado Alley region of the United States , although they can occur nearly anywhere in North America . They also occasionally occur in south @-@ central and eastern Asia , northern and east @-@ central South America , Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe , western and southeastern Australia , and New Zealand . Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse @-@ Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data , such as hook echoes or debris balls , as well as through the efforts of storm spotters . 
 There are several scales for rating the strength of tornadoes . The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale . An F0 or EF0 tornado , the weakest category , damages trees , but not substantial structures . An F5 or EF5 tornado , the strongest category , rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers . The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes . Doppler radar data , photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns ( cycloidal marks ) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word tornado is an altered form of the Spanish word <unk> , which means " thunderstorm " . This in turn was taken from the Latin <unk> , meaning " to thunder " . It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish <unk> and <unk> ( " to turn " ) ; however , this may be a folk etymology . A tornado is also commonly referred to as a " twister " , and is also sometimes referred to by the old @-@ fashioned colloquial term cyclone . The term " cyclone " is used as a synonym for " tornado " in the often @-@ aired 1939 film The Wizard of Oz . The term " twister " is also used in that film , along with being the title of the 1996 tornado @-@ related film Twister . 
 = = Definitions = = 
 A tornado is " a violently rotating column of air , in contact with the ground , either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud , and often ( but not always ) visible as a funnel cloud " . For a vortex to be classified as a tornado , it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base . Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word ; for example , there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes . Tornado refers to the vortex of wind , not the condensation cloud . 
 = = = Funnel cloud = = = 
 A tornado is not necessarily visible ; however , the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds ( as described by Bernoulli 's principle ) and rapid rotation ( due to <unk> balance ) usually causes water vapor in the air to condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling . This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel . 
 There is some disagreement over the definition of funnel cloud and condensation funnel . According to the Glossary of Meteorology , a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus , and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition . Among many meteorologists , the funnel cloud term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface , and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud . 
 Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface , and not all funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes . Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground , so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance . 
 = = = Outbreaks and families = = = 
 Occasionally , a single storm will produce more than one tornado , either simultaneously or in succession . Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm cell are referred to as a " tornado family " . Several tornadoes are sometimes spawned from the same large @-@ scale storm system . If there is no break in activity , this is considered a tornado outbreak ( although the term " tornado outbreak " has various definitions ) . A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area ( spawned by multiple weather systems ) is a tornado outbreak sequence , occasionally called an extended tornado outbreak . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Size and shape = = = 
 Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow funnel , a few hundred yards ( meters ) across , with a small cloud of debris near the ground . Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust . These tornadoes are especially dangerous , as even experienced meteorologists might not see them . Tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes . 
 Small , relatively weak landspouts may be visible only as a small swirl of dust on the ground . Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground , if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) , the circulation is considered a tornado . A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a " stovepipe " tornado . Large single @-@ vortex tornadoes can look like large wedges stuck into the ground , and so are known as " wedge tornadoes " or " wedges " . The " stovepipe " classification is also used for this type of tornado , if it otherwise fits that profile . A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds , wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground . Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low @-@ hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance . Many , but not all major tornadoes are wedges . 
 Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes , and often curl or twist into complex shapes . These tornadoes are said to be " roping out " , or becoming a " rope tornado " . When they rope out , the length of their funnel increases , which forces the winds within the funnel to weaken due to conservation of angular momentum . Multiple @-@ vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center , or they may be completely obscured by condensation , dust , and debris , appearing to be a single funnel . 
 In the United States , tornadoes are around 500 feet ( 150 m ) across on average and travel on the ground for 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) . However , there is a wide range of tornado sizes . Weak tornadoes , or strong yet dissipating tornadoes , can be exceedingly narrow , sometimes only a few feet or couple meters across . One tornado was reported to have a damage path only 7 feet ( 2 m ) long . On the other end of the spectrum , wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) wide or more . A tornado that affected Hallam , Nebraska on May 22 , 2004 , was up to 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) wide at the ground , and a tornado in El Reno , Oklahoma on May 31 , 2013 was approximately 2 @.@ 6 miles ( 4 @.@ 2 km ) wide , the widest on record . 
 In terms of path length , the Tri @-@ State Tornado , which affected parts of Missouri , Illinois , and Indiana on March 18 , 1925 , was on the ground continuously for 219 miles ( 352 km ) . Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles ( 160 km ) or longer are composed of a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession ; however , there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri @-@ State Tornado . In fact , modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado may have begun 15 miles ( 24 km ) further west than previously thought . 
 = = = Appearance = = = 
 Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors , depending on the environment in which they form . Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible , marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel . Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white . While traveling over a body of water ( as a waterspout ) , tornadoes can turn very white or even blue . Slow @-@ moving funnels , which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt , are usually darker , taking on the color of debris . Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil , and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow @-@ covered ground , turning white . 
 Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado . A tornado which is " back @-@ lit " ( viewed with the sun behind it ) appears very dark . The same tornado , viewed with the sun at the observer 's back , may appear gray or brilliant white . Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors , appearing in hues of yellow , orange , and pink . 
 Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm , heavy rain and hail , and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes . Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous , since only weather radar observations , or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado , serve as any warning to those in the storm 's path . Most significant tornadoes form under the storm 's updraft base , which is rain @-@ free , making them visible . Also , most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon , when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds . Night @-@ time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning . 
 There is mounting evidence , including Doppler On Wheels mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts , that most tornadoes have a clear , calm center with extremely low pressure , akin to the eye of tropical cyclones . Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado . 
 = = = Rotation = = = 
 Tornadoes normally rotate cyclonically ( when viewed from above , this is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern ) . While large @-@ scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect , thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is unimportant , as indicated by their large Rossby numbers . Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected . Low @-@ level mesocyclones and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment . 
 Approximately 1 percent of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction in the northern hemisphere . Typically , systems as weak as landspouts and <unk> can rotate anticyclonically , and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft ( RFD ) in a cyclonic supercell . On rare occasions , anticyclonic tornadoes form in association with the <unk> of an anticyclonic supercell , in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado , or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell . 
 = = = Sound and seismology = = = 
 Tornadoes emit widely on the acoustics spectrum and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms . Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported , mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar . Popularly reported sounds include a freight train , rushing rapids or waterfall , a nearby jet engine , or combinations of these . Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance ; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography . 
 The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent turbulent eddies , as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris , contribute to the sounds . Funnel clouds also produce sounds . Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling , whining , humming , or the buzzing of innumerable bees or electricity , or more or less harmonic , whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous , deep rumbling , or an irregular sound of " noise " . 
 Since many tornadoes are audible only when very near , sound is not reliable warning of a tornado . Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms ; any strong , damaging wind , a severe hail volley , or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound . 
 Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible infrasonic signatures . 
 Unlike audible signatures , tornadic signatures have been isolated ; due to the long distance propagation of low @-@ frequency sound , efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology , dynamics , and creation . Tornadoes also produce a detectable seismic signature , and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process . 
 = = = Electromagnetic , lightning , and other effects = = = 
 Tornadoes emit on the electromagnetic spectrum , with <unk> and E @-@ field effects detected . There are observed correlations between tornadoes and patterns of lightning . Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning . More often than not , overall cloud @-@ to @-@ ground ( CG ) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts . In many cases , intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges . <unk> and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes ( tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon ) , although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena . 
 Luminosity has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning , city lights , and power flashes from broken lines , as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded . In addition to winds , tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as temperature , moisture , and pressure . For example , on June 24 , 2003 near Manchester , South Dakota , a probe measured a 100 mbar ( hPa ) ( 2 @.@ 95 inHg ) pressure decrease . The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 mbar ( hPa ) ( 25 @.@ 10 inHg ) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away , resulting in a V @-@ shape pressure trace . Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 = = = Supercell relationship = = = 
 Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as supercells . Supercells contain mesocyclones , an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere , usually 1 – 6 miles ( 2 – 10 km ) across . Most intense tornadoes ( EF3 to EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale ) develop from supercells . In addition to tornadoes , very heavy rain , frequent lightning , strong wind gusts , and hail are common in such storms . 
 Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle . That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft ( RFD ) . This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground , and drags the supercell 's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it . 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 As the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base , it begins to take in cool , moist air from the downdraft region of the storm . The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form . The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone 's base , causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground . As the updraft intensifies , it creates an area of low pressure at the surface . This pulls the focused mesocyclone down , in the form of a visible condensation funnel . As the funnel descends , the RFD also reaches the ground , fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado . Usually , the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground ( becoming a tornado ) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground . 
 = = = Maturity = = = 
 Initially , the tornado has a good source of warm , moist air flowing inward to power it , and it grows until it reaches the " mature stage " . This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour , and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage , and in rare cases can be more than one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) across . Meanwhile , the RFD , now an area of cool surface winds , begins to wrap around the tornado , cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado . 
 = = = Dissipation = = = 
 As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado 's air supply , the vortex begins to weaken , and become thin and rope @-@ like . This is the " dissipating stage " , often lasting no more than a few minutes , after which the tornado ends . During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm , and can be blown into fantastic patterns . Even though the tornado is dissipating , it is still capable of causing damage . The storm is contracting into a rope @-@ like tube and , due to conservation of angular momentum , winds can increase at this point . 
 As the tornado enters the dissipating stage , its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well , as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it . Sometimes , in intense supercells , tornadoes can develop cyclically . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate , the storm 's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm and possibly feed a new mesocyclone . If a new mesocyclone develops , the cycle may start again , producing one or more new tornadoes . Occasionally , the old ( occluded ) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time . 
 Although this is a widely accepted theory for how most tornadoes form , live , and die , it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes , such as landspouts , long @-@ lived tornadoes , or tornadoes with multiple vortices . These each have different mechanisms which influence their development — however , most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one . 
 = = Types = = 
 = = = Multiple vortex = = = 
 A multiple @-@ vortex tornado is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air <unk> their own axis and at the same time around a common center . A multi @-@ vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation , but is very often observed in intense tornadoes . These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path . This is a phenomenon that is distinct from a satellite tornado , which is a smaller tornado which forms very near a large , strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone . The satellite tornado may appear to " orbit " the larger tornado ( hence the name ) , giving the appearance of one , large multi @-@ vortex tornado . However , a satellite tornado is a distinct circulation , and is much smaller than the main funnel . 
 = = = Waterspout = = = 
 A waterspout is defined by the National Weather Service as a tornado over water . However , researchers typically distinguish " fair weather " waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts . Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common , and are similar to dust devils and landspouts . They form at the bases of cumulus congestus clouds over tropical and subtropical waters . They have relatively weak winds , smooth laminar walls , and typically travel very slowly . They occur most commonly in the Florida Keys and in the northern Adriatic Sea . In contrast , tornadic waterspouts are stronger tornadoes over water . They form over water similarly to mesocyclonic tornadoes , or are stronger tornadoes which cross over water . Since they form from severe thunderstorms and can be far more intense , faster , and longer @-@ lived than fair weather waterspouts , they are more dangerous . In official tornado statistics , waterspouts are generally not counted unless they affect land , though some European weather agencies count waterspouts and tornadoes together . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 A landspout , or dust @-@ tube tornado , is a tornado not associated with a mesocyclone . The name stems from their characterization as a " fair weather waterspout on land " . Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics , including relative weakness , short lifespan , and a small , smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the surface . <unk> also create a distinctively laminar cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground , due to their differing mechanics from true <unk> tornadoes . Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes , they can produce strong winds which could cause serious damage . 
 = = = Similar circulations = = = 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 A gustnado , or gust front tornado , is a small , vertical swirl associated with a gust front or downburst . Because they are not connected with a cloud base , there is some debate as to whether or not <unk> are tornadoes . They are formed when fast moving cold , dry outflow air from a thunderstorm is blown through a mass of stationary , warm , moist air near the outflow boundary , resulting in a " rolling " effect ( often exemplified through a roll cloud ) . If low level wind shear is strong enough , the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground . The result is a gustnado . They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight @-@ line wind damage . 
 = = = = Dust devil = = = = 
 A dust devil ( also known as a whirlwind ) resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air . However , they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes . They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day . If there is enough low level wind shear , the column of hot , rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground . They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds . However , they can , on occasion , result in major damage . 
 = = = = Fire whirls = = = = 
 Small @-@ scale , tornado @-@ like circulations can occur near any intense surface heat source . Those that occur near intense wildfires are called fire whirls . They are not considered tornadoes , except in the rare case where they connect to a <unk> or other cumuliform cloud above . Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms . They can , however , produce significant damage . 
 = = = = Steam devils = = = = 
 A steam devil is a rotating updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke . These formations do not involve high wind speeds , only completing a few rotations per minute . Steam devils are very rare . They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant 's smokestack . Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter , faster @-@ rotating steam devil to form . The phenomenon can occur over water , when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water . 
 = = Intensity and damage = = 
 The Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused . The Enhanced Fujita ( EF ) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale , by expert <unk> , using engineered wind estimates and better damage descriptions . The EF Scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating , and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007 . An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures , whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers . The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes . Doppler weather radar data , photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns ( cycloidal marks ) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating . 
 Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape , size , and location , though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes . The association with track length and duration also varies , although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger . In the case of violent tornadoes , only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity , most of the higher intensity from <unk> . 
 In the United States , 80 % of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 ( T0 through T3 ) tornadoes . The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strength — less than 1 % are violent tornadoes ( EF4 , T8 or stronger ) . Outside Tornado Alley , and North America in general , violent tornadoes are extremely rare . This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall , as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide . A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe , Asia , southern Africa , and southeastern South America , respectively . 
 = = Climatology = = 
 The United States has the most tornadoes of any country , nearly four times more than estimated in all of Europe , excluding waterspouts . This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent . North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas , and has no major east @-@ west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas . In the middle latitudes , where most tornadoes of the world occur , the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow , forcing drier air at mid @-@ levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds , and causing the formation of a low pressure area downwind to the east of the mountains . Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a dry line when the flow aloft is strong , while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low @-@ level moisture in the southerly flow to its east . This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air , the conditions that breed strong , long @-@ lived storms throughout the year . A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley . This area extends into Canada , particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces , although southeast Quebec , the interior of British Columbia , and western New Brunswick are also tornado @-@ prone . Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico . 
 The United States averages about 1 @,@ 200 tornadoes per year . The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country ( more than 20 , or 0 @.@ 0013 per sq mi ( 0 @.@ <unk> per km2 ) , annually ) , followed by the UK ( around 33 , or 0 @.@ 00035 per sq mi ( 0 @.@ 00013 per km2 ) , per year ) , although those are of lower intensity , briefer and cause minor damage . 
 Tornadoes kill an average of 179 people per year in Bangladesh , the most in the world . Reasons for this include the region 's high population density , poor construction quality , and lack of tornado safety knowledge . Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa , the La Plata Basin area , portions of Europe , Australia and New Zealand , and far eastern Asia . 
 Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter , but tornadoes can occur any time of year that favorable conditions occur . Spring and fall experience peaks of activity as those are the seasons when stronger winds , wind shear , and atmospheric instability are present . Tornadoes are focused in the right front quadrant of landfalling tropical cyclones , which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn . Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices , which persist until landfall . 
 Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day , because of solar heating . Worldwide , most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon , between 3 pm and 7 pm local time , with a peak near 5 pm . Destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day . The Gainesville Tornado of 1936 , one of the deadliest tornadoes in history , occurred at 8 : 30 am local time . 
 = = = Associations with climate and climate change = = = 
 Associations with various climate and environmental trends exist . For example , an increase in the sea surface temperature of a source region ( e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea ) increases atmospheric moisture content . Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity , particularly in the cool season . 
 Some evidence does suggest that the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity , which vary by season and region , as well as whether the ENSO phase is that of El Niño or La Niña . Research has found that fewer tornadoes and hailstorms occur in winter and spring in the U.S. central and southern plains during El Niño , and more occur during La Niña , than in years when temperatures in the Pacific are relatively stable . Ocean conditions could be used to forecast extreme spring storm events several months in advance . 
 Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via teleconnections in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns . The climate @-@ tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local , nuanced nature of tornadoes . Although it is reasonable to suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity , any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity , local nature of the storms , and database quality issues . Any effect would vary by region . 
 = = Detection = = 
 Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid @-@ 20th century . Before the 1950s , the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground . Often , news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm . However , with the advent of weather radar , areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather . The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks in 1952 . In 1953 it was confirmed that hook echoes are associated with tornadoes . By recognizing these radar signatures , meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away . 
 = = = Radar = = = 
 Today , most developed countries have a network of weather radars , which remains the main method of detecting signatures probably associated with tornadoes . In the United States and a few other countries , Doppler weather radar stations are used . These devices measure the velocity and radial direction ( towards or away from the radar ) of the winds in a storm , and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles ( 160 km ) away . When storms are distant from a radar , only areas high within the storm are observed and the important areas below are not sampled . Data resolution also decreases with distance from the radar . Some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data . Also , most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites ( GOES ) , which aid in the nowcasting of tornadic storms . 
 = = = Storm spotting = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1970s , the U.S. National Weather Service ( NWS ) increased its efforts to train storm spotters to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail , damaging winds , and tornadoes , as well as damage itself and flash flooding . The program was called Skywarn , and the spotters were local sheriff 's deputies , state troopers , firefighters , ambulance drivers , amateur radio operators , civil defense ( now emergency management ) spotters , storm chasers , and ordinary citizens . When severe weather is anticipated , local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather , and report any tornadoes immediately , so that the office can warn of the hazard . 
 Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations , and report to them . The organizations activate public warning systems such as sirens and the Emergency Alert System ( EAS ) , and forward the report to the NWS . There are more than 230 @,@ 000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States . 
 In Canada , a similar network of volunteer weather watchers , called <unk> , helps spot severe weather , with more than 1 @,@ 000 volunteers . In Europe , several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe and the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation ( TORRO ) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since 1974 . 
 Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as NEXRAD do not detect a tornado ; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes . Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado , but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent . The spotter 's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases , because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar , chiefly due to curvature of Earth , and the beam also spreads out . 
 = = = Visual evidence = = = 
 Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a supercell . They typically look to its rear , the main region of updraft and inflow . Under the updraft is a rain @-@ free base , and the next step of tornadogenesis is the formation of a rotating wall cloud . The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell . 
 Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm 's shape and structure , and cloud tower features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower , a persistent , large overshooting top , a hard anvil ( especially when <unk> against strong upper level winds ) , and a corkscrew look or striations . Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found , evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands ( particularly when curved ) such as a " beaver tail " , and other clues such as strength of inflow , warmth and <unk> of inflow air , how <unk> or inflow @-@ dominant a storm appears , and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud . <unk> is most likely at the interface of the updraft and rear flank downdraft , and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow . 
 Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes , and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes . Rotating wall clouds may be a visual manifestation of a low @-@ level mesocyclone . Barring a low @-@ level boundary , tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs , which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud . A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after ; first , a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down , a surface swirl has already developed , signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm . Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds , under flanking lines , and on the leading edge . Spotters watch all areas of a storm , and the cloud base and surface .

 The most record @-@ breaking tornado in recorded history was the Tri @-@ State Tornado , which roared through parts of Missouri , Illinois , and Indiana on March 18 , 1925 . It was likely an F5 , though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era . It holds records for longest path length ( 219 miles , 352 km ) , longest duration ( about 3 @.@ 5 hours ) , and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado ( 73 mph , 117 km / h ) anywhere on Earth . In addition , it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history ( 695 dead ) . The tornado was also the costliest tornado in history at the time ( unadjusted for inflation ) , but in the years since has been surpassed by several others if population changes over time are not considered . When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation , it ranks third today . 
 The deadliest tornado in world history was the <unk> @-@ <unk> Tornado in Bangladesh on April 26 , 1989 , which killed approximately 1 @,@ 300 people . Bangladesh has had at least 19 tornadoes in its history kill more than 100 people , almost half of the total in the rest of the world . 
 The most extensive tornado outbreak on record was the 2011 Super Outbreak , which spawned 362 confirmed tornadoes over the southeastern United States - 218 of them within a single 24 @-@ hour period . The previous record was the 1974 Super Outbreak which spawned 148 tornadoes . 
 While direct measurement of the most violent tornado wind speeds is nearly impossible , since conventional anemometers would be destroyed by the intense winds and flying debris , some tornadoes have been scanned by mobile Doppler radar units , which can provide a good estimate of the tornado 's winds . The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado , which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet , is 301 ± 20 mph ( 484 ± 32 km / h ) in the F5 Bridge Creek @-@ Moore , Oklahoma , tornado which killed 36 people . Though the reading was taken about 100 feet ( 30 m ) above the ground , this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes . 
 Storms that produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts , sometimes exceeding 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance . A tornado which affected Great Bend , Kansas , in November 1915 , was an extreme case , where a " rain of debris " occurred 80 miles ( 130 km ) from the town , a sack of flour was found 110 miles ( 180 km ) away , and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of Palmyra , Nebraska , 305 miles ( 491 km ) to the northeast . Waterspouts and tornadoes have been advanced as an explanation for instances of raining fish and other animals . 
 = = Safety = = 
 Though tornadoes can strike in an instant , there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado . Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre @-@ determined plan should a tornado warning be issued . When a warning is issued , going to a basement or an interior first @-@ floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival . In tornado @-@ prone areas , many buildings have storm cellars on the property . These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives . 
 Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado ( such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada ) . Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area , though these are mainly available only in the United States . Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible , meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road ( so as not to block emergency traffic ) , and find a sturdy shelter . If no sturdy shelter is nearby , getting low in a ditch is the next best option . Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes , as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass .
