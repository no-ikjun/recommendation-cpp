 At the age of 24 , Henry made his first appearance on World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) programming on the March 11 , 1996 episode of Monday Night Raw , where he press slammed Jerry Lawler , who was ridiculing Henry while interviewing him in the ring . After Henry competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics , the WWF signed him to a ten @-@ year contract . Trained by professional wrestler Leo Burke , his first feud in the WWF was with Lawler . At the pay @-@ per @-@ view event , SummerSlam in August 1996 , Henry came to the aid of Jake Roberts who was suffering indignity at the hands of Lawler . His debut wrestling match was at In Your House : Mind Games on September 22 , 1996 , where he defeated Lawler . The feud continued on the live circuit during subsequent weeks . On the November 4 episode of Raw , Henry served as a cornerman for Barry Windham in a match against Goldust . He was set to team with Windham , Marc Mero and Rocky Maivia to take on the team of Lawler , Goldust , Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Crush at Survivor Series , but was replaced by Jake Roberts when he was forced to withdraw from the event due to injury . On the November 17 episode of Superstars , Henry defeated Hunter Hearst Helmsley , Crush and Goldust in a tug of war contest . Henry 's career was then stalled as , over the next year , he took time off to heal injuries and engage in further training . In November 1997 , he returned to the ring , making his televised return the following month . By the end of the year , he was a regular fixture on WWF programming , defeating Steve Lombardi on the December 15 episode of Raw , and beating The Sultan on the December 27 episode of Shotgun . 
 = = = = Nation of Domination and Sexual Chocolate ( 1998 – 2000 ) = = = = 
 Henry joined the faction with Farooq , The Rock , Kama Mustafa , and D 'Lo Brown on January 12 , 1998 . After The Rock usurped Farooq 's position as leader , Henry switched loyalties to The Rock . He also competed at WrestleMania XIV in a tag team Battle Royal with Brown as his partner , but they did not win . After The Nation disbanded , he engaged in a short feud with The Rock , defeating him at Judgment Day : In Your House with help from Brown , and then forming a permanent team with Brown , gaining Ivory as a manager . 
 During the next year , Henry gave himself the nickname Sexual Chocolate , and was involved in controversial angles with Chyna and a transvestite . During a match at the August 1999 SummerSlam pay @-@ per @-@ view between Brown and Jeff Jarrett for the WWF Intercontinental and WWF European Championships ( both held at the time by Brown ) , Henry turned on Brown and helped Jarrett win the match and the titles . The next night , Henry was awarded the European title by Jarrett in return for his help . Henry lost the title one month later to Brown at the Unforgiven pay @-@ per @-@ view . 
 The night after he tried to make up with Brown and later in the week claimed to be a sex addict resulting in him attending a sex therapy session a week later where he claimed that he lost his virginity at eight years old to his sister , and had just slept with her two days ago . 
 After this , Henry turned into a fan favorite , and was seen on television romancing WWF women from Chyna to Mae Young as part of the " Sexual Chocolate " character . He feuded with Viscera during this time , as part of a storyline where Viscera splashed Mae Young while she was carrying Henry 's child . Young later gave birth to a hand . Henry was part of various other embarrassing and infamous storylines , including one about him overcoming sex addiction . 
 = = = = Ohio Valley Wrestling and strongman competitions ( 2000 – 2001 ) = = = = 
 In 2000 , Henry was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) to improve his conditioning and wrestling skills . In OVW , he teamed with Nick Dinsmore to compete in a tournament for the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship in mid @-@ 2001 . Later that year , Henry 's mother died , causing him to go on hiatus from wrestling . He felt he had to compete in the " Super Bowl of weight lifting " — the Arnold Strongman Classic — in honor of his mother , who gave him his first weight set when he was a child . Four months prior to the contest , Henry began lifting the heaviest of weights and trained for the first time since 1997 for a major lifting competition . He had never been a professional strongman before , but in the coming contest he was to face the very best of the best of professional strongmen , such as the # 1 ranked strongman in the world , and defending World 's Strongest Man competition winner of 2001 Svend Karlsen , World 's Strongest Man winner of 2006 Phil Pfister , World Powerlifting Champion of 2001 and equipped deadlift world record holder Andy Bolton , World Muscle Power Champion , Olympic weightlifting Champion <unk> <unk> , and reigning America 's Strongest Man of 2001 Brian <unk> . Then on 22 , February 2002 in Columbus , Ohio the competition , consisting of four events , designed to determine the lifter with the greatest overall body power , began . Henry surprised everybody when he won the first event , setting a world record in the process by lifting the Apollon 's Axle three times overhead . Only three men in history had ever been able to press it at all . By <unk> 885 lbs for two reps in the second event and easily pushing a 5 @.@ 000 + lbs Hummer with nearly flat tires in the third event , Henry kept his lead continuously throughout the competition and never gave it up again . In the final " Farmer 's Walk " <unk> Henry quickly carried the roughly 850 lbs of railroad ties up an incline , winning the whole competition convincingly to capture the winning prize — a US $ 75 @,@ 000 Hummer , a vacation cruise and <unk> $ cash . Since Mark had only trained for four months and defeated the crème @-@ de @-@ là @-@ crème of worldwide strongmen , who had been practicing for years , his win was a shock for strongman experts worldwide , but remained basically unnoticed by the wrestling audience . Henry proved to be worthy of the title " World 's Strongest Man " not only by winning the contest , but also by achieving it in record time . By doing so he was again seen as the legit " strongest man in the world " by many lifting experts for a second time since 1996 .

 Henry returned to the WWE the next month and was sent to the SmackDown ! brand , where he developed an in @-@ ring persona of performing " tests of strength " while other wrestlers took bets on the tests , but the gimmick met with little success .

During that time , Henry was involved in a brief program with World Heavyweight Champion Goldberg when former champion , Triple H , put a bounty on Goldberg . This was followed by a brief rivalry with Shawn Michaels , before he engaged in a rivalry with Booker T. After defeating Booker T twice , once in a street fight and once in a six @-@ man tag team match , he lost to Booker T at the Armageddon pay @-@ per @-@ view in December 2003 .

These events led up to a feud with the returning Batista , whom Henry had put out of action with a legitimate injury several months beforehand . When Batista returned he and Henry were scheduled to face one another at The Great American Bash in July . Weeks before that event , however , on the July 15 , 2006 episode of Saturday Night 's Main Event , Henry was involved in a six @-@ man tag team match with King Booker and Finlay against Batista , Rey Mysterio , and Bobby Lashley .

On August 3 , he claimed that nobody accepted the open challenge to step into the ring with him because of what he had done to The Undertaker , presenting footage of his assault on The Undertaker . The Undertaker responded over the following weeks , playing various mind games with Henry . Henry finally faced The Undertaker again at Unforgiven in September , losing to him after being given a Last Ride .

 = John Joscelyn = 
 John Joscelyn or John Joscelin ( 1529 – 1603 ) was an English clergyman and antiquarian as well as secretary to Matthew Parker , an Archbishop of Canterbury during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England . Joscelyn was involved in Parker 's attempts to secure and publish medieval manuscripts on church history , and was one of the first scholars of the Old English language . He also studied the early law codes of England . His Old English dictionary , although not published during his lifetime , contributed greatly to the study of that language . Many of his manuscripts and papers eventually became part of the collections of Cambridge University , Oxford University , or the British Library . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Joscelyn was born in 1529 , and was the son of Sir Thomas Joscelin and Dorothy Gate . John was their third son to survive childhood , and was probably born on his father 's estate at High Roding , Essex . He attended Queens ' College at Cambridge beginning in 1545 , attaining a Bachelor of Arts in 1549 . In the school year 1550 – 1551 he taught Latin at Queens ' College , and the following school year he taught Greek . At the end of 1552 , he was awarded a Master of Arts . In 1555 , during Queen Mary I 's reign , Joscelyn subscribed to the required church doctrine , and was once more a teacher of Greek during the school year 1556 – 1557 . However , in 1557 he resigned from his fellowship at Queens ' College . 
 = = Work for Parker = = 
 In 1559 shortly after he was appointed as archbishop , Matthew Parker , the Archbishop of Canterbury , named Joscelyn to a <unk> , and also as his Latin language secretary . The following year Parker gave Joscelyn a prebend in Hereford , held until 1577 . Unusually for the time , besides Greek and Latin Joscelyn was a scholar of Hebrew . From Parker 's interest in the history of early Christianity , and to discover more information about the growth of papal power in the Middle Ages , Joscelyn also began to study Old English ( a topic of interest to Parker ) , and helped the archbishop in his studies of the English pre @-@ Norman Conquest church . Joscelyn helped discover lost manuscripts , obtained them for Parker , and prepared them for publication . Joscelyn also acquired manuscripts for himself , 40 of which were written in Old English . 
 <unk> often annotated the manuscripts he or Parker owned , and even inserted some pages of faked script into the D manuscript of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , and probably owned that manuscript prior to Robert Cotton . His glosses are still extant on several dozen manuscripts , usually in Latin , but occasionally in English . He was , however , also concerned that their collections be properly cared for . He had a good understanding of the law codes of the English Anglo @-@ Saxon kings , which he used in the preparation of an Old English @-@ Latin dictionary he worked on , but which was never completed . The dictionary was , however , of great help to later Old English scholars , as it passed into the hands of Robert Cotton , and became part of the Cotton Library as manuscripts Titus A xv and Titus A <unk> . Joscelyn 's written work on Old English grammar also became part of the Cotton library , but was lost after Cotton loaned the manuscript to William Camden in 1612 . 
 Parker published in 1572 a work entitled De Antiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae & <unk> Ecclesiae <unk> , cum <unk> <unk> 70 , which is the first privately printed work to appear in English . Although Parker claimed in a letter that he was the author , it is likely that at the very least Joscelyn did most of the research , and the manuscript of the work , which is now Vitellius E xiv , is largely in his handwriting . Further , Parker 's son , after the archbishop 's death , noted beside the bequest notation for Joscelyn 's brother Thomas that John Joscelyn was the author of the work . 
 = = Legacy and death = = 
 Joscelyn also published an edition of Gildas ' work De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae in 1568 , for which he wrote the preface . He also wrote a history of Corpus Christi College at Cambridge that remained unpublished until 1880 , 200 years after his death . He contributed extensively to Parker 's A <unk> of <unk> Shewing the <unk> Fayth in the Church of England , the earliest printed book containing portions in Old English . Joscelyn also contributed a large part of Parker 's De Antiquitate Britannicae , published in 1572 . 
 In 1577 , Parker 's successor gave Joscelyn a rectory at Hollingbourne , Kent , replacing the prebend at Hereford . He died on 28 December 1602 , probably at High Roding , and was buried in All Saint 's Church in High Roding . He never married . 
 Joscelyn 's contributions to the study of Old English have been called " a significant contribution to the development of the study of the language " . The historian May McKisack called him a " man of great learning and a good servant to his master " . Besides his dictionary and grammar , his working notebook also became part of the Cotton library , now manuscript Vitellius <unk> Other of his manuscripts , either written or acquired by him , were either given to Corpus Christi College by Parker 's heirs , or became parts of the British Library or the Bodleian Library . 
 = Keratoconus = 
 Keratoconus ( KC , <unk> ) is a degenerative disorder of the eye in which structural changes within the cornea cause it to thin and change to a more conical shape than the more normal gradual curve . Keratoconus can cause substantial distortion of vision , with multiple images , streaking and sensitivity to light all often reported by the person . It is typically diagnosed in the person 's adolescent years . If both eyes are significantly affected , the deterioration in vision can affect the person 's ability to drive a car or read normal print . 
 In most cases , corrective lenses fitted by a specialist are effective enough to allow the person to continue to drive legally and likewise function normally . Further progression of the disease may require surgery , for which several options are available , including intrastromal corneal ring segments , corneal collagen cross @-@ linking , mini asymmetric radial keratotomy , corneal intrastromal implantation system ( <unk> ) , topography @-@ guided <unk> <unk> ( PRK ) , topography @-@ guided conductive keratoplasty , <unk> intraocular lenses and , in 25 % of cases , corneal transplantation . 
 Estimates of the rates for keratoconus range from 1 in 500 to 1 in 2000 people , but difficulties with differential diagnosis cause uncertainty . It seems to occur in populations throughout the world , although it is observed more frequently in certain ethnic groups , such as South Asians . Environmental and genetic factors are considered possible causes , but the exact cause is uncertain . It has been associated with detrimental enzyme activity within the cornea . The word is from Greek : kéras horn , cornea ; and Latin : <unk> cone . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 People with early keratoconus typically notice a minor blurring of their vision and come to their clinician seeking corrective lenses for reading or driving . At early stages , the symptoms of keratoconus may be no different from those of any other refractive defect of the eye . As the disease progresses , vision deteriorates , sometimes rapidly . Visual acuity becomes impaired at all distances , and night vision is often poor . Some individuals have vision in one eye that is markedly worse than that in the other . The disease is often bilateral , though asymmetrical . Some develop photophobia ( sensitivity to bright light ) , eye strain from squinting in order to read , or itching in the eye , but there is normally little or no sensation of pain . It may cause luminous objects to appear as cylindrical pipes with the same intensity at all points . 
 The classic symptom of keratoconus is the perception of multiple " ghost " images , known as monocular <unk> . This effect is most clearly seen with a high contrast field , such as a point of light on a dark background . Instead of seeing just one point , a person with keratoconus sees many images of the point , spread out in a chaotic pattern . This pattern does not typically change from day to day , but over time , it often takes on new forms . People also commonly notice streaking and flaring distortion around light sources . Some even notice the images moving relative to one another in time with their heart beat . The predominant optical aberration of the eye in keratoconus is coma . The visual distortion experienced by the person comes from two sources , one being the irregular deformation of the surface of the cornea , and the other being scarring that occurs on its exposed highpoints . These factors act to form regions on the cornea that map an image to different locations on the retina . The effect can worsen in low light conditions , as the dark @-@ adapted pupil dilates to expose more of the irregular surface of the cornea . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Prior to any physical examination , the diagnosis of keratoconus frequently begins with an ophthalmologist 's or optometrist 's assessment of the person 's medical history , particularly the chief complaint and other visual symptoms , the presence of any history of ocular disease or injury which might affect vision , and the presence of any family history of ocular disease . An eye chart , such as a standard Snellen chart of progressively smaller letters , is then used to determine the person 's visual acuity . The eye examination may proceed to measurement of the localized curvature of the cornea with a manual <unk> , with detection of irregular astigmatism suggesting a possibility of keratoconus . Severe cases can exceed the instrument 's measuring ability . A further indication can be provided by <unk> , in which a light beam is focused on the person 's retina and the reflection , or reflex , observed as the examiner tilts the light source back and forth . Keratoconus is amongst the ophthalmic conditions that exhibit a scissor reflex action of two bands moving toward and away from each other like the blades of a pair of scissors . 
 If keratoconus is suspected , the ophthalmologist or optometrist will search for other characteristic findings of the disease by means of slit lamp examination of the cornea . An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner , and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing . Under close examination , a ring of yellow @-@ brown to olive @-@ green pigmentation known as a Fleischer ring can be observed in around half of keratoconic eyes . The Fleischer ring , caused by deposition of the iron oxide <unk> within the corneal epithelium , is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases , but becomes more evident when viewed under a cobalt blue filter . Similarly , around 50 % of subjects exhibit Vogt 's striae , fine stress lines within the cornea caused by stretching and thinning . The striae temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball . A highly pronounced cone can create a V @-@ shaped indentation in the lower eyelid when the person 's gaze is directed downwards , known as Munson 's sign . Other clinical signs of keratoconus will normally have presented themselves long before Munson 's sign becomes apparent , and so this finding , though a classic sign of the disease , tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance . 
 A handheld <unk> , sometimes known as " Placido 's disk " , can provide a simple noninvasive visualization of the surface of the cornea by projecting a series of concentric rings of light onto the cornea . A more definitive diagnosis can be obtained using corneal topography , in which an automated instrument projects the illuminated pattern onto the cornea and determines its topography from analysis of the digital image . The topographical map indicates any distortions or scarring in the cornea , with keratoconus revealed by a characteristic steepening of curvature which is usually below the centreline of the eye . The technique can record a snapshot of the degree and extent of the deformation as a benchmark for assessing its rate of progression . It is of particular value in detecting the disorder in its early stages when other signs have not yet presented . 
 = = = Stages = = = 
 Once keratoconus has been diagnosed , its degree may be classified by several metrics : 
 The steepness of greatest curvature from ' mild ' ( < 45 D ) , ' advanced ' ( up to 52 D ) or ' severe ' ( > 52 D ) ; 
 The morphology of the cone : ' nipple ' ( small : 5 mm and near @-@ central ) , ' oval ' ( larger , below @-@ center and often sagging ) , or ' globus ' ( more than 75 % of cornea affected ) ; 
 The corneal thickness from mild ( > 506 μm ) to advanced ( < 446 μm ) . 
 Increasing use of corneal topography has led to a decline in use of these terms . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Despite considerable research , the etiology of keratoconus remains unclear . Several sources suggest that keratoconus likely arises from a number of different factors : genetic , environmental or cellular , any of which may form the trigger for the onset of the disease . Once initiated , the disease normally develops by progressive dissolution of Bowman 's layer , which lies between the corneal epithelium and stroma . As the two come into contact , cellular and structural changes in the cornea adversely affect its integrity and lead to the bulging and scarring characteristic of the disorder . Within any individual keratoconic cornea , regions of degenerative thinning coexisting with regions undergoing wound healing may be found . Scarring appears to be an aspect of the corneal degradation ; however , a recent , large , <unk> study suggests abrasion by contact lenses may increase the likelihood of this finding by a factor over two . 
 A number of studies have indicated keratoconic corneas show signs of increased activity by proteases , a class of enzymes that break some of the collagen cross @-@ linkages in the stroma , with a simultaneous reduced expression of protease inhibitors . Other studies have suggested that reduced activity by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase may be responsible for a build @-@ up of free radicals and oxidising species in the cornea . Whatever the <unk> process , the damage caused by activity within the cornea likely results in a reduction in its thickness and biomechanical strength . At an ultrastructural level the weakening of the corneal tissue is associated with a disruption of the regular arrangement of the collagen layers and collagen fibril orientation . While keratoconus is considered a <unk> disorder , one study shows wearing rigid contact lenses by people leads to overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines , such as IL @-@ 6 , TNF @-@ alpha , ICAM @-@ 1 , and <unk> @-@ 1 in the tear fluid . 
 A genetic predisposition to keratoconus has been observed , with the disease running in certain families , and incidences reported of concordance in identical twins . The frequency of occurrence in close family members is not clearly defined , though it is known to be considerably higher than that in the general population , and studies have obtained estimates ranging between 6 % and 19 % . Two studies involving isolated , largely <unk> communities have contrarily mapped putative gene locations to chromosomes <unk> and <unk> . Most genetic studies agree on an autosomal dominant model of inheritance . A rare , autosomal dominant form of severe keratoconus with anterior polar cataract is caused by a mutation in the seed region of mir @-@ 184 , a microRNA that is highly expressed in the cornea and anterior lens . Keratoconus is diagnosed more often in people with Down 's syndrome , though the reasons for this link have not yet been determined . 
 Keratoconus has been associated with atopic diseases , which include asthma , allergies , and eczema , and it is not uncommon for several or all of these diseases to affect one person . Keratoconus is also associated with Alport syndrome , Down syndrome and Marfan syndrome . A number of studies suggest vigorous eye rubbing contributes to the progression of keratoconus , and people should be discouraged from the practice . Keratoconus differs from <unk> which is caused by LASIK eye surgery . Post @-@ LASIK <unk> has been associated with the excessive removal of the eye 's stromal bed tissue during surgery .

 = = = Lenses = = = 
 In early stages of keratoconus , glasses or soft contact lenses can suffice to correct for the mild astigmatism . As the condition progresses , these may no longer provide the person with a satisfactory degree of visual acuity , and most practitioners will move to manage the condition with rigid contact lenses , known as rigid , gas @-@ permeable , ( RGP ) lenses . RGP lenses provide a good level of visual correction , but do not arrest progression of the condition . 
 In people with keratoconus , rigid contact lenses improve vision by means of tear fluid filling the gap between the irregular corneal surface and the smooth regular inner surface of the lens , thereby creating the effect of a smoother cornea . Many specialized types of contact lenses have been developed for keratoconus , and affected people may seek out both doctors specialized in conditions of the cornea , and contact lens fitters who have experience managing people with keratoconus . The irregular cone presents a challenge and the fitter will endeavor to produce a lens with the optimal contact , stability and steepness . Some trial @-@ and @-@ error fitting may prove necessary . 
 = = = = Hybrid lenses = = = = 
 Traditionally , contact lenses for keratoconus have been the ' hard ' or RGP variety , although manufacturers have also produced specialized ' soft ' or hydrophilic lenses and , most recently , silicone <unk> lenses . A soft lens has a tendency to conform to the conical shape of the cornea , thus diminishing its effect . To counter this , hybrid lenses have been developed which are hard in the centre and encompassed by a soft skirt . However , soft or earlier generation hybrid lenses did not prove effective for every person . Early generation lenses have been discontinued . The fourth generation of hybrid lens technology has improved , giving more people an option that combines the comfort of a soft lens with the visual acuity of an RGP lens . 
 = = = = <unk> lenses = = = = 
 <unk> lenses are sometimes prescribed for cases of advanced or very irregular keratoconus ; these lenses cover a greater proportion of the surface of the eye and hence can offer improved stability . Easier handling can find favor with people with reduced dexterity , such as the elderly . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Some people find good vision correction and comfort with a " piggyback " lens combination , in which RGP lenses are worn over soft lenses , both providing a degree of vision correction . One form of piggyback lens makes use of a soft lens with a countersunk central area to accept the rigid lens . Fitting a piggyback lens combination requires experience on the part of the lens fitter , and tolerance on the part of the person with keratoconus . 
 = = = Surgery = = = 
 = = = = Corneal transplant = = = = 
 Between 11 % and 27 % of cases of keratoconus will progress to a point where vision correction is no longer possible , thinning of the cornea becomes excessive , or scarring as a result of contact lens wear causes problems of its own , and a corneal transplantation or penetrating keratoplasty becomes required . Keratoconus is the most common grounds for conducting a penetrating keratoplasty , generally accounting for around a quarter of such procedures . The corneal transplant surgeon <unk> a <unk> of corneal tissue and then grafts the donor cornea to the existing eye tissue , usually using a combination of running and individual sutures . The cornea does not have a direct blood supply , so the donor tissue is not required to be blood type matched . Eye banks check the donor corneas for any disease or cellular irregularities . 
 The acute recovery period can take four to six weeks , and full postoperative vision stabilization often takes a year or more , but most transplants are very stable in the long term . The National Keratoconus Foundation reports that penetrating keratoplasty has the most successful outcome of all transplant procedures , and when performed for keratoconus in an otherwise healthy eye , its success rate can be 95 % or greater . The sutures used usually dissolve over a period of three to five years , but individual sutures can be removed during the healing process if they are causing irritation to the person . 
 In the USA , corneal transplants ( also known as corneal grafts ) for keratoconus are usually performed under sedation as outpatient surgery . In other countries , such as Australia and the UK , the operation is commonly performed with the person undergoing a general anaesthetic . All cases require a careful follow @-@ up with an eye doctor ( ophthalmologist or optometrist ) for a number of years . Frequently , vision is greatly improved after the surgery , but even if the actual visual acuity does not improve , because the cornea is a more normal shape after the healing is completed , people can more easily be fitted with corrective lenses . Complications of corneal transplants are mostly related to vascularization of the corneal tissue and rejection of the donor cornea . Vision loss is very rare , though difficult @-@ to @-@ correct vision is possible . When rejection is severe , repeat transplants are often attempted , and are frequently successful . Keratoconus will not normally reoccur in the transplanted cornea ; incidences of this have been observed , but are usually attributed to incomplete excision of the original cornea or inadequate screening of the donor tissue . The long @-@ term outlook for corneal transplants performed for keratoconus is usually favorable once the initial healing period is completed and a few years have elapsed without problems . 
 One way of reducing the risk of rejection is to use a technique called deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( <unk> ) . In a <unk> graft , only the outermost epithelium and the main bulk of the cornea , the stroma , are replaced ; the person 's rearmost endothelium layer and the Descemet 's membrane are left , giving some additional structural integrity to the <unk> cornea . Furthermore , it is possible to transplant freeze @-@ dried donor tissue . The freeze @-@ drying process ensures this tissue is dead , so there is no chance of rejection . 
 = = = = = <unk> = = = = = 
 Rarely , a nonpenetrating keratoplasty known as an <unk> ( or <unk> ) may be performed in cases of keratoconus . The corneal epithelium is removed and a <unk> of donor cornea is grafted on top of it . The procedure requires a greater level of skill on the part of the surgeon , and is less frequently performed than a penetrating keratoplasty , as the outcome is generally less favorable . However , it may be seen as an option in a number of cases , particularly for young people . 
 = = = = Corneal ring implants = = = = 
 A possible surgical alternative to corneal transplant is the insertion of intrastromal corneal ring segments . A small incision is made in the periphery of the cornea and two thin arcs of <unk> <unk> are slid between the layers of the stroma on either side of the pupil before the incision is closed by a suture . The segments push out against the curvature of the cornea , flattening the peak of the cone and returning it to a more natural shape . The procedure offers the benefit of being reversible and even potentially exchangeable as it involves no removal of eye tissue . 
 = = = = Cross @-@ linking = = = = 
 Corneal collagen cross @-@ linking is a developing treatment which aims to strengthen the cornea , however , according to a 2015 Cochrane review , there is insufficient evidence to determine if it is useful in keratoconus . 
 In 2016 , the US Food and Drug Administration approved <unk> 's riboflavin ophthalmic solution and <unk> system for crosslinking based on three 12 @-@ month clinical trials . 
 = = = = Radial keratotomy = = = = 
 Radial keratotomy is a refractive surgery procedure where the surgeon makes a spoke @-@ like pattern of incisions into the cornea to modify its shape . This early surgical option for myopia has been largely superseded by LASIK and other similar procedures . LASIK is absolutely contraindicated in keratoconus and other corneal thinning conditions as removal of corneal stromal tissue will further damage an already thin and weak cornea . For similar reasons , radial keratotomy has also generally not been used for people with keratoconus . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Patients with keratoconus typically present initially with mild astigmatism and myopia , commonly at the onset of puberty , and are diagnosed by the late teenage years or early 20s . The disease can , however , present or progress at any age ; in rare cases , keratoconus can present in children or not until later adulthood . A diagnosis of the disease at an early age may indicate a greater risk of severity in later life . Patients ' vision will seem to fluctuate over a period of months , driving them to change lens prescriptions frequently , but as the condition worsens , contact lenses are required in the majority of cases . The course of the disorder can be quite variable , with some patients remaining stable for years or indefinitely , while others progress rapidly or experience occasional exacerbations over a long and otherwise steady course . Most commonly , keratoconus progresses for a period of 10 to 20 years before the course of the disease generally ceases in the third and fourth decades of life . 
 = = = Corneal hydrops = = = 
 In advanced cases , bulging of the cornea can result in a localized rupture of Descemet 's membrane , an inner layer of the cornea . Aqueous humor from the eye 's anterior chamber seeps into the cornea before Descemet 's membrane <unk> . The patient experiences pain and a sudden severe clouding of vision , with the cornea taking on a translucent milky @-@ white appearance known as a corneal hydrops . Although disconcerting to the patient , the effect is normally temporary and after a period of six to eight weeks , the cornea usually returns to its former transparency . The recovery can be aided <unk> by bandaging with an osmotic saline solution . Although a hydrops usually causes increased scarring of the cornea , occasionally it will benefit a patient by creating a flatter cone , aiding the fitting of contact lenses . Corneal transplantation is not usually indicated during corneal hydrops . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 The National Eye Institute reports keratoconus is the most common corneal dystrophy in the United States , affecting about one in 2 @,@ 000 Americans , but some reports place the figure as high as one in 500 . The inconsistency may be due to variations in diagnostic criteria , with some cases of severe astigmatism interpreted as those of keratoconus , and vice versa . A long @-@ term study found a mean incidence rate of 2 @.@ 0 new cases per 100 @,@ 000 population per year . Some studies have suggested a higher prevalence amongst females , or that people of South Asian ethnicity are 4 @.@ 4 times as likely to suffer from keratoconus as Caucasians , and are also more likely to be affected with the condition earlier . 
 Keratoconus is normally bilateral ( affecting both eyes ) although the distortion is usually asymmetric and is rarely completely identical in both corneas . Unilateral cases tend to be uncommon , and may in fact be very rare if a very mild condition in the better eye is simply below the limit of clinical detection . It is common for keratoconus to be diagnosed first in one eye and not until later in the other . As the condition then progresses in both eyes , the vision in the earlier @-@ diagnosed eye will often remain poorer than that in its fellow . 
 = = History = = 
 The German oculist Burchard <unk> provided an early description in a 1748 doctoral dissertation of a case of keratoconus , which he called <unk> <unk> . However , it was not until 1854 that British physician John Nottingham ( 1801 – 1856 ) clearly described keratoconus and distinguished it from other <unk> of the cornea . Nottingham reported the cases of " conical cornea " that had come to his attention , and described several classic features of the disease , including <unk> , weakness of the cornea , and difficulty matching corrective lenses to the patient 's vision . In 1859 , British surgeon William Bowman used an ophthalmoscope ( recently invented by Hermann von Helmholtz ) to diagnose keratoconus , and described how to angle the instrument 's mirror so as to best see the conical shape of the cornea . Bowman also attempted to restore vision by pulling on the iris with a fine hook inserted through the cornea and stretching the pupil into a vertical slit , like that of a cat . He reported that he had had a measure of success with the technique , restoring vision to an 18 @-@ year @-@ old woman who had previously been unable to count fingers at a distance of 8 inches ( 20 cm ) . By 1869 , when the pioneering Swiss ophthalmologist Johann Horner wrote a thesis entitled On the treatment of keratoconus , the disorder had acquired its current name . The treatment at that time , endorsed by the leading German ophthalmologist Albrecht von Graefe , was an attempt to physically reshape the cornea by chemical cauterization with a silver nitrate solution and application of a <unk> @-@ causing agent with a pressure dressing . In 1888 , the treatment of keratoconus became one of the first practical applications of the then newly invented contact lens , when the French physician Eugène Kalt manufactured a glass scleral shell that improved vision by compressing the cornea into a more regular shape . Since the start of the 20th century , research on keratoconus has both improved understanding of the disease and greatly expanded the range of treatment options . The first successful corneal transplantation to treat keratoconus was done in 1936 by Ramon Castroviejo . 
 = = Related disorders = = 
 Several other corneal <unk> disorders , also cause thinning of the cornea : 
 <unk> is a very rare condition that causes corneal thinning primarily at the margins , resulting in a spherical , slightly enlarged eye . It may be genetically related to keratoconus . 
 <unk> marginal degeneration causes thinning of a narrow ( 1 – 2 mm ) band of the cornea , usually along the inferior corneal margin . It causes irregular astigmatism that , in the early stages of the disease can be corrected by spectacles . Differential diagnosis may be made by slit @-@ lamp examination . 
 Posterior keratoconus , a distinct disorder despite its similar name , is a rare abnormality , usually congenital , which causes a <unk> thinning of the inner surface of the cornea , while the curvature of the anterior surface remains normal . Usually only a single eye is affected . 
 Post @-@ LASIK <unk> is a complication of LASIK eye surgery .

 The FN Five @-@ seven , trademarked as the Five @-@ <unk> , is a semi @-@ automatic pistol designed and manufactured by Fabrique Nationale d ’ Armes de Guerre @-@ Herstal ( FN Herstal ) in Belgium ( trademark capitalization style is intended to emphasize the manufacturer 's initials . ) 
 It is a lightweight polymer @-@ based weapon with a large magazine capacity , ambidextrous controls , low recoil , and the ability to penetrate body armor when using certain cartridge types . It is known as the " cop killer . " The nickname was reported as a cultural phenomena by Wired and many others , and tested by the Brady campaign which called it a " Risk to Police Officers . " 
 Sales of the Five @-@ seven were originally restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers , but since 2004 , the pistol has also been offered to civilian shooters for personal protection , target shooting , and similar uses . Although offered only with sporting ammunition , the Five @-@ seven 's introduction to civilian shooters was met with vocal opposition from gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign , and the pistol has been subject to ongoing controversy in the United States . 
 The Five @-@ seven is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations , including Canada , France , Greece , India , Poland , Spain , and the United States . In the United States , the Five @-@ seven is in use with numerous law enforcement agencies , including the U.S. Secret Service . In the years since the pistol 's introduction to the civilian market in the United States , it has also become increasingly popular with civilian shooters .

 The Five @-@ seven pistol and its 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm ammunition were developed by FN Herstal in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9 × 19mm Parabellum cartridge and associated pistols and submachine guns . NATO called for two types of weapons chambered for a new cartridge — one a shoulder @-@ fired weapon , and the other a handheld weapon . According to NATO , these new weapons , termed personal defense weapons ( <unk> ) , were to provide " personal protection in last @-@ resort situations when the user is directly endangered by the enemy [ ... ] . " In 1989 , NATO published document D / 296 , outlining a number of preliminary specifications for these weapons : 
 The new cartridge was to have greater range , accuracy , and terminal performance than the 9 × 19mm cartridge . Additionally , it was to be capable of penetrating certain types of body armor . 
 The shoulder @-@ fired personal defense weapon was to weigh less than 3 kg ( 6 @.@ 6 lb ) , with a magazine capacity of at least 20 rounds . 
 The handheld personal defense weapon ( pistol ) was to weigh less than 1 kg ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) , although a weight of 700 g ( 1 @.@ 5 lb ) was deemed desirable ; it was to have a magazine capacity of no fewer than 20 rounds . 
 Both weapons were to be sufficiently compact to be carried hands @-@ free on the user 's person at all times , whether in the cab of a vehicle or the cockpit of an aircraft , and were to perform effectively in all environments and weather conditions . 
 FN Herstal was the first small arms manufacturer to respond to NATO 's requirement ; FN started by developing a shoulder @-@ fired personal defense weapon , the FN P90 , along with a small caliber , high velocity 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridge type . The original 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridge , called the SS90 , went into production with the P90 in 1990 . This cartridge type was discontinued in 1993 , and replaced with the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm SS190 , which used a heavier and slightly shorter projectile weighing 2 @.@ 0 g ( 31 grains ) . The reduced length of the SS190 projectile allowed it to be used more conveniently in the Five @-@ seven , which was under development at that time . 
 In 1993 , Jean @-@ Louis <unk> of FN filed a United States patent application for a delayed blowback operating system intended for the Five @-@ seven pistol , and U.S. Patent 5 @,@ 347 @,@ 912 ( " Elements for decelerating the recoil of the moving parts of a fire arm " ) was received the following year . In 1995 , FN officially announced development of the Five @-@ seven pistol , and a prototype of the pistol was publicly displayed the following year . With some improvements , a double @-@ action only model of the pistol went into production in 1998 , and a single @-@ action model called the Five @-@ seven Tactical was then introduced shortly afterward . The Five @-@ seven first entered service in May 2000 , when the Cypriot National Guard ( Greek : <unk> <unk> ) purchased 250 pistols for their special forces group . 
 = = = NATO evaluation = = = 
 In 2002 and 2003 , NATO conducted a series of tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9 × 19mm Parabellum cartridge . The tests compared the relative merits of the FN 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridge and the HK 4 @.@ 6 × 30mm cartridge , which was created by German small arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm . The results of the NATO tests were analyzed by a group formed of experts from Canada , France , the United Kingdom , and the United States , and the group 's conclusion was that the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm was " undoubtedly " the more efficient cartridge . 
 However , the German delegation and others rejected the NATO recommendation that 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm be standardized , halting the standardization process indefinitely . As a result , both the 4 @.@ 6 × 30mm and 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridges ( and the associated weapons ) have been independently adopted by various NATO countries , according to preference ; the Five @-@ seven pistol is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations throughout the world .

 Historically , sales of the Five @-@ seven pistol were restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers , but in 2004 the new Five @-@ seven IOM model was introduced and offered to civilian shooters for use with 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm sporting ammunition . The IOM model incorporated several modifications to the weapon 's design , such as the addition of an <unk> accessory rail , a magazine safety mechanism , and fully adjustable sights . Although offered only with sporting ammunition , the Five @-@ seven 's introduction to civilian shooters was met with strong opposition from gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign . 
 Further development of the Five @-@ seven pistol led to the introduction of the Five @-@ seven USG model , which was approved by the ATF as a sporting firearm in 2004 . The USG model incorporates a conventionally shaped square trigger guard , a reversible magazine release , and other minor changes . 
 In 2013 , the Five @-@ seven MK2 model was introduced , replacing the USG model . The MK2 model has cocking serrations on the front of the slide , all black controls , and slightly different iron sights . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Five @-@ seven is a semi @-@ automatic delayed blowback pistol chambered for FN 's 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm ammunition . The pistol has a concealed hammer . Polymer materials are used extensively in the pistol 's design , and even the steel slide is encased in a polymer shell . In addition to providing reduced weight and greater resistance to corrosion , this also prevents unwanted light reflection . The slide 's polymer shell gives the pistol the appearance of being constructed entirely of polymers , but the slide interior , barrel , trigger , springs , pins , and similar parts are all steel . However , the pistol is unusually lightweight , weighing only 744 g ( 1 @.@ 6 lb ) with a loaded 20 @-@ round magazine . 
 The Five @-@ seven is a full @-@ size pistol , having an overall length of 208 mm ( 8 @.@ 2 in ) , a height of 137 mm ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) , and a max width of 36 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) . It has the same grip angle as the distinguished Browning Hi @-@ Power and M1911 pistols . Despite the considerable length of the pistol 's 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm ammunition , the grip is not particularly unwieldy — the distance from the trigger to the back of the grip measures 69 @.@ 85 mm ( 2 @.@ 750 in ) , which is identical to a U.S. Military issue M9 pistol chambered in 9 × 19mm Parabellum . The Five @-@ seven barrel is cold hammer @-@ forged and chrome @-@ lined , with a total length of 122 mm ( 4 @.@ 8 in ) and a rifled length of 94 mm ( 3 @.@ 7 in ) . The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right @-@ hand twist rate of 1 : 231 mm ( 1 : 9 @.@ 1 in ) , and it weighs 113 g ( 0 @.@ 249 lb ) . The small caliber gives the barrel a length in calibers of more than 20 , 58 % more than a comparable 9 mm barrel . It has a stated service life of 20 @,@ 000 rounds and the Five @-@ seven is noted for being very accurate . 
 Current models of the Five @-@ seven are single @-@ action , having a short and light trigger pull of 20 to 30 N ( 4 @.@ 4 to 6 @.@ 6 lbF ) . They have a Picatinny rail for mounting accessories , and a magazine safety mechanism that prevents the pistol from firing without a magazine inserted . The grip texture on current pistols is extensively checkered for a superior hold , and each side of the slide has a series of narrow ridges at the rear to aid grasping . The trigger and trigger guard surfaces also have grooves to reduce finger slip , and the trigger guard is elongated to ease firing while wearing gloves . The Five @-@ seven is currently offered in two different frame finishes ( standard black or flat dark earth ) , and two different iron sight systems ( adjustable sights or low profile fixed sights ) . 
 = = = Ammunition = = = 
 Particularly significant to the design of the Five @-@ seven pistol is the small caliber , high velocity bottlenecked cartridge it uses . The 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridge was created by FN Herstal in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9 × 19mm Parabellum cartridge , which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns . The 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridge weighs 6 @.@ 0 g ( 93 grains ) — roughly half as much as a typical 9 × 19mm cartridge — making extra ammunition less burdensome , or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight . Since the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter , an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine . The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash , but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9 × 19mm cartridge , improving controllability . Due to its high velocity , the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm also exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory . 
 One of the design intents for the standard 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridge type , the SS190 , was that it have the ability to penetrate Kevlar protective vests — such as the NATO CRISAT vest — that will stop conventional pistol bullets . Fired from the Five @-@ seven , the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm SS190 has a muzzle velocity of roughly 650 m / s ( 2 @,@ 130 ft / s ) and is capable of penetrating the CRISAT vest at a range of 100 m ( 110 yd ) , or 48 layers of Kevlar material ( roughly equivalent to two stacked Level II Kevlar vest panels ) at a range of 50 m ( 55 yd ) . It is also capable of penetrating a <unk> vest at a range of 300 m ( 330 yd ) or a <unk> helmet at a range of 240 m ( 260 yd ) . FN states an effective range of 50 m ( 55 yd ) and a maximum range of 1 @,@ 510 m ( 1 @,@ 650 yd ) for the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridge when fired from the Five @-@ seven pistol . 
 In testing conducted by Passaic County , New Jersey Sheriff 's Department , the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm SS190 penetrated to a depth of 27 cm ( 11 in ) in bare ballistic gelatin , and a depth of 23 cm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) in gelatin protected with a Kevlar vest . In testing , the SS190 and similar 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ( " tumble " ) as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media , using the 21 @.@ 6 @-@ mm ( .85 in ) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity . However , some are skeptical of the bullet 's terminal performance , and it is a subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States . 
 The 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm projectile potentially poses less risk of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets , because the projectile design limits overpenetration , as well as risk of ricochet . The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of collateral damage in the event of a miss , because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m ( 440 yd ) , whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9 × 19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m ( 870 yd ) . This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridge 's intended applications , so the cartridge 's limited energy at long range is not considered to be disadvantageous . Since the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow @-@ point bullet , the cartridge and pistol are considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899 , which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The Five @-@ seven pistol feeds from detachable box magazines , but it is unconventional in that it feeds cartridges into the chamber without the use of a barrel feed ramp , having a beveled chamber only — the pistol 's feeding is inherently reliable because of its use of bottlenecked cartridges . The pistol is supplied with 20 @-@ round magazines as standard , or 10 @-@ round magazines for jurisdictions where magazines are restricted by law to a maximum capacity of 10 rounds . The Five @-@ seven will also accept an aftermarket extended 30 @-@ round magazine , which protrudes an additional 38 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) from the base of the pistol . With an additional cartridge in the chamber , the Five @-@ seven pistol has a total capacity of 11 , 21 , or 31 rounds depending on which magazine type is used . Magazine pouches for the Five @-@ seven magazine are available from various manufacturers . 
 The Five @-@ seven 's magazine can be disassembled for cleaning or lubrication by removing the polymer <unk> . The magazine body is constructed of polymer , with steel inserts at the feed lips . Unlike a conventional pistol magazine , it feeds from dual feed lips , with a follower that has the same appearance as that of an M16 rifle 's magazine , and which is loaded in the same manner : by pushing cartridges straight down into the magazine , rather than pushing them down and back . This setup makes it very easy to load individual cartridges into the magazine . The magazine <unk> has a slight finger spur , and four holes in the left side of the magazine body allow a convenient estimate of the amount of remaining ammunition . 
 = = = Controls = = = 
 All controls ( excluding the trigger ) on the Five @-@ seven USG and earlier models are grey polymer , in contrast to the black polymer frame and slide cover . Similarly , all of the controls on the Five @-@ seven FDE and Five @-@ seven ODG models are black polymer , in contrast to the flat dark earth and olive drab polymer frames . A takedown lever is located at the front on the left side of the weapon 's frame , and a slide release is located at the rear on the left side of the frame ; these controls are protected from accidental movements by slight projections in the frame contour . A chamber indicator , in the form of a pin inside a tiny hole , is provided on the left side of the slide . When a round has been chambered , this pin will protrude 1 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 063 in ) , which is sufficient to provide both visible and tactile indication of the chamber 's status . 
 Current models of the Five @-@ seven have an ambidextrous manual safety device , which is located in an unconventional position : one control is found on each side of the frame above the trigger guard , where it is reachable with the trigger finger or support hand thumb . A red dot is visible here when the safety is deactivated and the pistol is ready to fire ; when the safety is moved to the raised position , it is activated and the red dot is no longer visible . The Five @-@ seven 's push @-@ button magazine release , located on the left side of the frame where the trigger guard intersects with the grip , is square @-@ shaped and reversible for left @-@ handed shooters . 
 The Five @-@ seven can be disassembled quickly and easily , by using the left hand to retract and hold the slide 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) rearwards , while simultaneously using the left @-@ hand thumb to push and hold the takedown lever rearwards . When the slide is released , it moves forward freely and the complete slide assembly can be disengaged from the frame , whereupon the barrel ( and captured recoil spring ) can be removed from the slide . This level of disassembly is sufficient to perform thorough cleaning of the pistol , and FNH USA recommends no further disassembly except by an authorized armorer , FN Herstal , or FNH USA . <unk> of the pistol is done in the reverse order , except no use of the disassembly lever is necessary . 
 = = = Sights and accessories = = = 
 The Five @-@ seven has a sight radius of 178 mm ( 7 @.@ 0 in ) ; the pistol is currently offered with either adjustable sights or fixed sights . The " three @-@ dot " type adjustable sights consist of a 2 @.@ 9 @-@ mm ( 0 @.@ 12 in ) square notch rear and a 3 @.@ 6 @-@ mm ( 0 @.@ 14 in ) blade front , which has a height of 9 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 36 in ) . The sights are targeted at 91 @.@ 4 m ( 100 @.@ 0 yd ) , but can be adjusted for either windage or elevation . The " three @-@ dot " type C @-@ More fixed sights , which are offered as a low profile alternative to the adjustable sights , can only be adjusted for windage . The fixed sights are targeted at 7 @.@ 6 m ( 25 ft ) using SS195LF ammunition , and are available with or without tritium @-@ illuminated inserts ( " night sights " ) to aid use of the pistol in dim lighting . 
 The Five @-@ seven is supplied with a lockable hard case , a locking device and keys , a magazine release reversal tool , a sight adjustment tool ( not included with the fixed sights model ) , a cleaning kit , an owner 's manual , and three 20 @-@ round magazines ( or three 10 @-@ round magazines , where restricted by law ) . 
 The Five @-@ seven can be used in conjunction with a wide range of firearm accessories ; holsters are offered by various manufacturers , and the pistol 's MIL @-@ STD @-@ 1913 ( Picatinny ) accessory rail will accept tactical lights or laser aiming devices . With the use of an extended , threaded barrel , the pistol can also be fitted with various sound suppressors developed by Advanced Armament Corporation , Gemtech , <unk> , and other manufacturers . The Gemtech <unk> @-@ 57 , which was developed in 1998 specifically for use with the Five @-@ seven , is a matte black aluminum suppressor with a length of 147 mm ( 5 @.@ 8 in ) , a diameter of 32 mm ( 1 @.@ 3 in ) , and a weight of 147 g ( 0 @.@ 324 lb ) . Israeli manufacturer FAB Defense offers a complete PDW conversion kit for the Five @-@ seven , designated the <unk> G2 FN 5 @.@ 7 , that allows the pistol to be reconfigured into a shoulder @-@ fired personal defense weapon , and <unk> offers a weapon system compatible with the Five @-@ seven that allows the shooter to aim and fire around corners without being exposed . 
 = = Variants = = 
 Five @-@ seven 
 The original Five @-@ seven was introduced in 1998 , and it is now discontinued . It had no manual safety device and it was double @-@ action only , with a heavy trigger pull of 4 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 5 <unk> ( 10 to 14 lbF ) ; its double @-@ action only trigger was harshly criticized . The original Five @-@ seven had a pebbled grip pattern , a smoothly contoured accessory rail , low profile fixed sights and a large circular @-@ shaped trigger guard designed to facilitate gloved use . It did not have a slide release and the slide was not serrated as on newer models , but a portion at the rear of the slide was instead slightly concave to aid grasping . The pistol also had slightly different markings , with an FN logo placed on the left side of the frame above the trigger guard . 
 Five @-@ seven Tactical 
 The Five @-@ seven Tactical was introduced shortly after the original double @-@ action only model , as a single @-@ action alternative . It had a short and light trigger pull of 2 to 3 <unk> ( 4 @.@ 4 to 6 @.@ 6 lbF ) , as on current models . It also had the addition of an ambidextrous manual safety device ( located on each side of the frame , as on current models ) , and a slide release . Aside from these modifications , the Tactical model was identical to the original double @-@ action only Five @-@ seven . It was discontinued following the introduction of the IOM model . 
 Five @-@ seven IOM 
 The Five @-@ seven IOM ( Individual Officer Model ) was the first model of the Five @-@ seven pistol to be offered to civilian shooters , debuting in 2004 . It is now discontinued in favor of the USG model . The IOM was similar in its basic design to the Tactical version , but differed in that it had a MIL @-@ STD @-@ 1913 ( Picatinny ) accessory rail , a serrated slide and trigger guard , and fully adjustable sights . It also had a magazine safety mechanism incorporated into the design , to prevent the pistol from being fired without a magazine inserted . 
 Five @-@ seven USG 
 The Five @-@ seven USG ( United States Government ) model was approved by the ATF as a sporting firearm in 2004 , replacing the IOM model . The USG retained the changes that were incorporated in the IOM , but it had further modifications , including a conventionally shaped square trigger guard , a tightly checkered grip pattern , and a larger , reversible magazine release . It was originally offered with adjustable sights , but starting in 2009 it was also offered with low profile fixed sights . The USG model had a black frame finish with grey controls as standard , but it was also offered in limited quantities with black controls . Since 2013 , the USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA . 
 Five @-@ seven FDE 
 The Five @-@ seven FDE ( Flat Dark Earth ) model was built to the same specifications as the Five @-@ seven USG , but it had a brown frame finish and black controls , as opposed to the standard black frame finish and grey controls of the Five @-@ seven USG . Like the USG model , the FDE was offered with either adjustable sights or low profile fixed sights . Since 2013 , the original FDE model is no longer listed by FNH USA , although a flat dark earth version of the new MK2 is available . 
 Five @-@ seven ODG 
 The Five @-@ seven ODG ( Olive Drab Green ) model was built to the same specifications as the Five @-@ seven USG model , but it had an olive drab frame finish and black controls , as opposed to the standard black frame finish and grey controls of the Five @-@ seven USG . Like the USG model , the ODG model was offered with either adjustable sights or low profile fixed sights . Since 2012 , the ODG model is no longer listed by FNH USA . 
 = = = Current model = = = 
 Five @-@ seven MK2 
 The Five @-@ seven MK2 model was introduced in 2013 , and is now the standard version of the Five @-@ seven offered by FN Herstal . This new model has cocking serrations on the front of the slide , and has been reported to have a one @-@ piece metal slide ( under the polymer cover ) , whereas the previous models have a two @-@ piece welded metal slide . There is apparently still a choice of fixed or adjustable sights : the model shown on FNH 's site is a fixed @-@ sight version ; a model with adjustable sights was photographed at the 2013 SHOT show . The rear sight on the adjustable @-@ sight version has also been changed , with beefed @-@ up construction and white straight @-@ edge sight references compared to the present three @-@ dot target @-@ style sights ; these have been described as " combat adjustable sights " . 
 The MK2 has a black frame and slide , with flat black controls in place of the grey controls of the IOM and USG models . It is also available with a flat dark earth frame color . 
 Note : The MK2 is slightly wider than previous models and will not fit most custom holsters made for earlier versions of the Five @-@ seven .

 The Five @-@ seven pistol and 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm ammunition were originally restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers , but in 2004 the new Five @-@ seven IOM model was introduced , and offered to civilian shooters for use with 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm SS192 ammunition . FNH USA has marketed the Five @-@ seven to civilian shooters as a pistol suitable for personal protection , target shooting , and similar uses , but the Five @-@ seven 's introduction to civilian shooters was strongly opposed by U.S. gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign ; by the end of 2004 , sales of the Five @-@ seven pistol had increased dramatically . 
 In early 2005 , the pistol was subject to controversy in the United States after the Brady Campaign stated that commercially available 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm SS192 ammunition penetrated a Level IIA Kevlar vest in testing . The National Rifle Association ( NRA ) shortly countered the Brady Campaign 's claim by stating that the gun control group may not have adhered to standard testing procedures , and that FN offers armor @-@ piercing varieties of the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridge only to military and law enforcement customers . Varieties offered to civilians are classified by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) as not armor @-@ piercing , and it was stated that the SS192 and SS196 cartridge variations were unable to penetrate various types of Kevlar vests in tests conducted by FNH USA . 
 Michael D. Barnes , then @-@ president of the Brady Campaign , responded to the NRA 's statements on the Five @-@ seven by challenging NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre to be shot with the pistol while wearing a Kevlar vest . The NRA again responded to the Brady Campaign 's statements , saying that " Barnes demonstrated his group 's complete and utter disregard for gun safety and its flaming zeal to further restrict the rights of law @-@ abiding gun owners . " In the same year , two pieces of legislation were introduced in the United States Congress , specifically targeting the Five @-@ seven pistol and 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm ammunition for a federal ban : the H.R. 1136 : PLEA Act was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Eliot Engel ( D @-@ NY ) , and the S. 527 : PLEA Act was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D @-@ NJ ) ; neither bill proceeded to a vote by the House or Senate . 
 In March 2007 , legislation was again introduced in the United States Congress by Rep. Engel , under the new designation H.R. 1784 : PLEA Act . Once again , the bill failed to proceed to a vote . In the following years , the Five @-@ seven was subject to further controversy due to reports of the pistol 's use by drug cartels in the Mexican Drug War . In the United States , the Five @-@ seven has never been used to kill a police officer , but various news sources such as The Boston Globe and La Jornada reported incidents in which the pistol was used to shoot and kill police officers or civilians in Mexico . According to the ATF , the Five @-@ seven is one of the weapons favored by drug cartels in the Mexican Drug War , and a smuggled Five @-@ seven pistol can sell for up to 66 @,@ 000 pesos ( US $ 5 @,@ 000 ) in Mexico . From Mexico , the pistols have been smuggled into other South American countries ; in a July 2010 drive @-@ by shooting in <unk> , Colombia , two cartel gunmen armed with Five @-@ seven pistols opened fire on a group of bystanders outside a nightclub , leaving 9 people dead and 10 wounded . 
 In November 2009 , the Five @-@ seven again became subject to controversy in the United States , following the shooting at Fort Hood military base , in Texas . A U.S. Army psychiatrist , Major Nidal Malik Hasan , opened fire on fellow soldiers with a Five @-@ seven pistol , killing 13 people and wounding 29 in the worst shooting ever to take place on an American military base . Shortly after the shooting , FNH USA responded with a fact sheet dismissing allegations about the nature of the pistol , stating that it is only offered to civilians with sporting ammunition . Later in the month , a number of gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign wrote a collaborative letter to U.S. President Barack Obama , citing the weapon 's use by the Fort Hood shooter and Mexican drug cartels , and calling on him to ban importation of the Five @-@ seven pistol and 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm ammunition . In July 2010 , legislation was introduced in the United States Congress by Rep. Engel , for a third time , under the new designation H.R. <unk> : PLEA Act . Like its previous incarnations , the H.R. <unk> bill failed to proceed to a vote by either the House of Representatives or Senate .

 The first military organization to adopt the Five @-@ seven was the Cypriot National Guard ( Greek : <unk> <unk> ) , which purchased 250 pistols in May 2000 for its special forces group . By 2009 , the Five @-@ seven was in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations throughout the world . In 2009 , the Military of Libya purchased 367 Five @-@ seven pistols from FN Herstal , along with various other FN weapons , in a controversial sale valued at 11 @.@ 5 million euros ( US $ 15 @.@ 8 million ) . In 2011 , these weapons were used by Muammar Gaddafi 's military forces in the 2011 Libyan civil war , and Libyan rebel forces were also photographed using captured examples in the war . 
 In the United States , the Five @-@ seven is currently used by over 300 law enforcement agencies , including the U.S. Secret Service . Military and law enforcement organizations using the Five @-@ seven include : 
 = Langit Makin Mendung = 
 " Langit Makin Mendung " ( " The Sky is Increasingly Cloudy " ) is a controversial Indonesian short story . Published in Sastra magazine under the pen name Kipandjikusmin in August 1968 , it tells the story of Muhammad descending to Earth with the angel Gabriel to investigate the decreasing number of Muslims entering heaven , only to find that Muslims in Indonesia have begun fornicating , drinking alcohol , waging war on Muslims , and otherwise going against the tenets of Islam because of <unk> , a government policy during Sukarno 's administration that combined nationalism , religion , and communism . Unable to do anything to stop the rampant sinning , Muhammad and Gabriel watch the political maneuvering , crime , and famine in Jakarta in the form of eagles . 
 Upon publication , " Langit Makin Mendung " drew heavy criticism for its depictions of Allah , Muhammad , and Gabriel . Sastra was banned in North Sumatra , and the magazine 's offices in Jakarta were attacked . Despite published apologies from the writer and publisher , the head editor of Sastra , HB Jassin , was tried for blasphemy ; he was later sentenced to a one @-@ year suspended sentence . Critical views of the story vary ; the story has been compared to Dante 's Divine Comedy for its depiction of a man on a spiritual quest with a spiritual companion , yet criticized for depicting Allah , Muhammad , and Gabriel in a negative light . The legal case itself has been subject to debate , with both sides arguing freedom of expression and the scope of imagination . 
 = = Background = = 
 Indonesia is the world 's largest majority @-@ Muslim country . This has had a large influence on the development of Indonesia , both in its national revolution and in modern times . However , it has been used to justify and promote political positions . The Dutch colonial government minimized the role of the religious leaders , the kyai and ulama , in an attempt to prevent them using their influence to lead resistance . Modern rulers have used it to " maintain the status quo " , while those pushing for change use Islam as a means for justice or other political ends . This has led to a general fragmentation . 
 During the early 1960s then @-@ President Sukarno declared a new state ideology of Nasakom , which stood for <unk> , Agama , dan <unk> ( Nationalism , Religion , and Communism ) , which would complement the existing policy of Pancasila . This declaration , viewed as proof of increasing Indonesian Communist Party ( Partai Komunis Indonesia , or PKI ) power , led to conflict between the PKI and the military . In the midst of an escalating confrontation with Malaysia ( 1963 – 1966 ) , Sukarno demoted General Abdul Haris Nasution , Commander of the Army , and promoted Ahmad Yani , while the PKI spread rumours that a CIA @-@ sponsored board of generals ( Dewan Jenderal ) were plotting against the government , using the Gilchrist Document as proof . Eventually , a coup on 30 September 1965 , thought to have been sponsored by the PKI , killed six generals , leading to the massacre of suspected communists and the fall of Sukarno 's government over the next two years .

 Muhammad and the other prophets of Islam , bored of living in jannah ( heaven ) and weary of singing the praises of Allah , request permission to return to Earth . Disappointed by the prophets ' request , Allah calls on Muhammad to explain why he wishes to return , as Allah had already granted him many things . Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research , to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven . Allah , after removing his glasses , responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno 's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further . 
 After much fanfare , Muhammad departs jannah 's airport , riding a <unk> , or winged horse . The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him . On the way , they encounter a Soviet spacecraft . Hearing that they are infidels , Muhammad approaches to investigate , only to crash into the spacecraft , obliterating it and the <unk> and killing the three cosmonauts ; Muhammad and Gabriel are able to catch a cloud . Later , they pass Jakarta , which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth . Angered by Gabriel 's statement that less than a million of Indonesia 's 90 million Muslims are true believers , as well as the fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom , Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud . 
 Meanwhile , in Jakarta , an epidemic of the flu is underway . Among those who fall ill is President Sukarno , who writes to Chairman Mao Zedong to request some doctors . Mao sends doctors , who give Sukarno poison to paralyze him and aid the 30 September Movement in overthrowing the government . The slow acting poison causes Sukarno to faint after he and his ministers have a large party with haraam events , including the consumption of pork and frog and zina ( sex outside of marriage ) . 
 Muhammad and Gabriel , having transformed into eagles to observe Jakarta , see prostitution , adultery , theft , and drinking . Muhammad is shocked that zina and theft continue unabated , calling for Gabriel to help him stone the adulterers and cut the hands off the thieves . Gabriel replies that there are not enough stones for the adulterers , and the swords have been replaced by guns bought by the " infidel " Soviets and Americans who " worship dollars " . They later see a minister , referred to only as <unk> , attempting to use the Gilchrist Document to overthrow Sukarno . Muhammad gives up on Indonesia , planning to install television in jannah . 
 Eventually , Sukarno recovers from the poison and is told about the Gilchrist Document , also being told that the Chinese are reneging on their agreement to supply nuclear weapons for Indonesia 's confrontation with Malaysia . Sukarno uses the Gilchrist Document to spread rumours and distrust among the populace , demoting his commander of the military , while the Chinese ambassador is sent home . 
 = = Writing and influences = = 
 " Langit Makin Mendung " was written under the pen name Kipandjikusmin . HB Jassin , head editor of Sastra , said that Kipandjikusmin had been born to a Muslim family but educated in a Catholic junior school prior to being sent to a naval academy ; Jassin noted that this Catholic education , with literature which personifies God and angels , may have influenced his writing style . Another influence was Javanese wayang , or shadow puppets , with stories which traditionally have a hierarchy of anthropomorphic deities . Jassin also notes influences from the culture of the Guided Democracy era , evidenced from terms like <unk> and the social commentary , with strong condemnation of prostitution in Indonesia and Sukarno 's Nasakom . 
 Kipandjikusmin later wrote to Ekspres magazine that his goal in writing the short story was to expose the corruption in Sukarno 's government , focusing on the religious leaders who had agreed with Nasakom when it was politically expedient to do so , yet turned against the PKI when the party was hunted and its members killed . He also admitted the influences proposed by Jassin , writing that he had often thought of the Catholic heaven as being similar to the Javanese <unk> , with God being similar to Batara Guru . His depictions of Muhammad and Gabriel transforming into eagles were influenced by images of Christ as the Lamb of God . It was originally meant to be a serial , and Jassin had already received the second instalment by the time the controversy began .

 " Langit Makin Mendung " has been described as being written with crude and offensive expressions . Jassin argues that the style , though direct and at times discourteous , indicates a sense of irony , humor , sarcasm , and cynicism . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 " Langit Makin Mendung " was published in the literary magazine Sastra , headed by HB Jassin , in August 1968 , under the pen name Kipandjikusmin . It became instantly controversial , with Indonesian Muslims considering it blasphemous and an insult to Islam . Among the points of contention were the anthropomorphic personification of Allah , as well as the " less than respectful " treatment of Muhammad and other Islamic figures . It was banned in North Sumatra on 12 October and groups of young Muslims attacked Sastra 's headquarters in Jakarta . After threats of prosecution , Jassin and his co @-@ editor Rachman issued a public apology ; despite this , the magazine was banned . On 22 or 25 October 1968 , Kipandjikusmin followed suit , with a statement submitted to Kami . 
 In April 1969 or February 1970 , the High Prosecutor 's office in Medan filed charges against Jassin , charging him with blasphemy after he was unwilling to divulge Kipandjikusmin 's true name . At trial , Jassin argued that , as the story was a product of the author 's imagination , it should not be considered an insult to Islam ; he also cited physical descriptions of Allah from the Quran and Sufi literature , as well as the writer 's Christian influences . A witness for the prosecution , noted ulama and writer Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah ( Hamka ) , testified that a depiction of Allah wearing glasses implied that Allah was imperfect , as opposed to the personifications cited by Jassin , which were based on man 's love for Allah . Hamka later stated that nobody had been able to incite hatred against Muhammad like Kipandjikusmin since the Crusades . Jassin was sentenced to a one @-@ year suspended sentence . 
 = = Polemics = = 
 = = = Literary = = = 
 Jassin writes that " Langit Makin Mendung " , as a result of its author 's imagination , is not dogma , history , ethics , or an objective reality , but a work within its own world . As a result , Allah , Muhammad , and other religious figures are fictional characters and not representative of their counterparts . He further argues that " Langit Makin Mendung " is not written as an insult , but social criticism on perceived mistakes and corruption during the Sukarno period . He draws on parallels between " Langit Makin Mendung " , Dante 's Divine Comedy , and Allama Muhammad Iqbal 's Javid Nama , focusing on the journey of a person and a guide , with objections being raised due to readers identifying imagination with religion . 
 Another critic , <unk> <unk> , wrote that " Langit Makin Mendung " had to be judged based on Kipandjikusmin 's intentions , which he interpreted as ridding Islam of Nasakom , which he saw as not being compatible . He noted that the Muslims criticized in the story are those who act in ways that are not permitted in Islam , such as drinking and committing zina , while other targets include inept leadership and corruption . Like Jassin , <unk> notes numerous instances of Allah being personified in the Quran and hadiths ; he views the personification of Allah in " Langit Makin Mendung " as an attempt to draw Muslims closer to Allah . 
 <unk> argues that " Langit Makin Mendung " would have been a " monumental " critique , with a good description of degeneration and immorality in the early 1960s , if written during Sukarno 's regime , like Machiavelli 's The Prince was for its time , but as it was released in the New Order it lost some of its impact . He notes that in most cases the personification of Allah as being compatible with Islamic views of Allah . However , Allah 's donning of gold spectacles is seen as being in contradiction to the tenets of Islam . 
 An opposing view , offered by Indonesian literary critic M. Jusuf Lubis , is that " Langit Makin Mendung " , as it is based on actual events and dogma , including Muhammad 's night journey . He rejects the view that the controversy arose from a misunderstanding of the story , writing that Indonesian Muslims reacted because they will not accept works that they see as denying the existence of Allah or comparing Pancasila to Nasakom . He notes that Jassin is inconsistent in his defense , calling the representations of Allah , Muhammad , and Gabriel figments of the author 's imagination , but citing Sukarno and Nasakom as influences . 
 = = = Legal = = = 
 Many studies have been made pertaining to the legal aspects of the " Langit Makin Mendung " case . One opinion is that the prosecution office had no legal basis for acting as both judge and literary critic in the case , with the blasphemy laws used in prosecution not being at least government or parliamentary level . The banning of Sastra is criticized for having no legal basis , as laws pertaining to the banning of print media at the time only applied to foreign publications ; per the then @-@ applicable Press Laws , any banning of a magazine would require approval of the Press Board . The need for freedom of speech is also mentioned . 
 Another view is that the prosecution 's actions were justified , pointing to the obscurity of the press laws , as well as the intent to publish , indicated by the story 's prominent placement in the magazine . In response to arguments that the banning of Sastra was a violation of the right to freedom of speech , <unk> 'bah Asa argues that the public and prosecutors have the same right , which can exercised through protests or legal action . Poet Taufiq Ismail notes that most protests against the prosecution 's actions were for their motion to ban Sastra , a reputable and respected publication , which does not indicate that " Langit Makin Mendung " was being supported . 
 = Breaking Benjamin = 
 Breaking Benjamin is an American rock band from Wilkes @-@ Barre , Pennsylvania , founded in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel . The first lineup of the band also included guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski . This lineup released two albums , Saturate ( 2002 ) and We Are Not Alone ( 2004 ) , before Hummel was replaced by Chad Szeliga in 2005 . The band released two more studio albums , Phobia ( 2006 ) and Dear Agony ( 2009 ) , before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley 's recurring illnesses . 
 The release of a compilation album amid the hiatus , Shallow Bay : The Best of Breaking Benjamin ( 2011 ) , unauthorized by Burnley , brought about legal trouble within the band resulting in the dismissal of Fink and Klepaski . Szeliga later announced his departure in 2013 citing creative differences . Burnley remained the sole member of the band until late 2014 , when the current lineup was announced , including bassist and backing vocalist Aaron Bruch , guitarist and backing vocalist Keith Wallen , guitarist Jasen Rauch , and drummer Shaun Foist . The band afterward released Dark Before Dawn in 2015 . 
 Despite significant lineup changes , the band 's musical style and lyrical content has remained consistent , with Burnley serving as the primary composer and lead vocalist since the band 's inception . The band has commonly been noted for its formulaic hard rock tendencies with angst @-@ heavy lyrics , swelling choruses , and " crunching " guitars . In the United States alone , the band has sold more than 7 million units and yielded two RIAA @-@ certified platinum records , two gold records , and several certified singles , including one multi @-@ platinum , three platinum , and three gold . The band has also produced one number one record on the Billboard 200 .

 Benjamin Burnley was originally in a band named Breaking Benjamin in 1998 that played " softer music " such as Weezer and The Beatles covers , and was " nothing like " subsequent lineups . The name originates from an incident in which Burnley broke a borrowed microphone , prompting its owner to retort , " Thanks to Benjamin for breaking my fucking mic . " This band included guitarist Aaron Fink , bassist Nick Hoover , and drummer Chris <unk> , but soon broke up when Burnley moved to California . After returning to Pennsylvania with drummer Jeremy Hummel , Burnley formed Plan 9 , which also included bassist Jason Davoli . Plan 9 , a reference to Plan 9 from Outer Space , was continually misnamed as " Planet 9 " , therefore the group reclaimed the name Breaking Benjamin from the previous band , as Burnley still had promotional stickers with that name . 
 The three @-@ piece first gained attention when Freddie Fabbri , a DJ for active rock radio station <unk> , put the group 's track " <unk> " in rotation . After it became the number one requested track on the station , Fabbri financed the recording of the group 's eponymous EP , which sold all 2 @,@ 000 copies that were printed in 2001 . Jonathan " Bug " Price was credited on bass , replacing Davoli . After growing dissatisfied with their previous band , former band mate Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski joined Breaking Benjamin . In early 2002 , over a dozen record companies visited a two @-@ night showcase where Breaking Benjamin was playing , and the group subsequently signed with Hollywood Records . Shortly afterward , Breaking Benjamin began recording their first full @-@ length major @-@ label record , Saturate , which was released on August 7 , 2002 and produced by Ulrich Wild . It peaked at No. 136 on the Billboard 200 , and was later certified gold on September 25 , 2015 . In early 2003 , Breaking Benjamin participated in the Jägermeister Music Tour , then toured as a supporting act for Godsmack . 
 Of the little media coverage received , Saturate garnered positive reception , with Jason Taylor from AllMusic stating that the album " has serious potential to become one of 2002 's most successful debuts , " feeling that " although it is repetitive and generic , it is undeniably addictive " , ultimately scoring the album 2 @.@ 5 out of 5 . The disc received a favorable review from <unk> 's Vin Cherubino , who noted , " The music has just as much quality as any popular artist in the same genre . Influences from bands such as Tool can be heard , making the music seem all so familiar and palatable . " 
 = = = We Are Not Alone ( 2003 – 2005 ) = = = 
 Breaking Benjamin returned to the studio in October 2003 with producer David Bendeth for their sophomore effort We Are Not Alone . Burnley also worked with The Smashing Pumpkins front man Billy Corgan over the course of six days in December 2003 to write the songs " Rain " , " Forget It " , and " Follow " . Despite initially being nervous , Burnley felt it was one of the highlights of his career . 
 The album was released on June 29 , 2004 and sold 48 @,@ 000 copies in its first week , peaking at No. 20 on the Billboard 200 . It was later certified gold on October 21 , 2004 , then platinum on June 13 , 2005 . The record features singles such as " So Cold " and " Sooner or Later " , both of which peaked at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart . " So Cold " became a platinum single on September 25 , 2015 . MTV writer Jon Wiederhorn writes that the initial commercial success of the album can be attributed to a tour two weeks prior to the album 's debut which " generated prerelease buzz " . They later co @-@ headlined a tour with Evanescence , Seether , and Three Days Grace . 
 We Are Not Alone garnered mixed reviews . It was met with high acclaim from IGN 's Colin Moriarty , who felt " extremely satisfied , " saying " safely and confidently " that it " might be my personal favorite album of the year , " giving it a score of 9 @.@ 3 out of 10 . Conversely , Exclaim ! writer Amber <unk> felt that , " On first listen its simply generic sound did nothing for me , " though later admitted , " I listened to Breaking Benjamin several times over a week and several elements of the disc started to grow on me , even appeal to me . " The writer concluded , " Breaking Benjamin created a standard of quality for themselves that they simply couldn 't meet on the entire disc . " 
 On November 3 , 2004 , a non @-@ album single named " Blow Me Away " was released , to commercial success , ultimately going gold on November 24 , 2015 . On November 23 , 2004 , Breaking Benjamin released the So Cold EP , which features live versions of the songs " Away " and " Breakdown " , a live acoustic version of " So Cold " , and studio acoustic recordings of " Blow Me Away " and " Lady Bug " . 
 In late 2005 , drummer Hummel filed a federal lawsuit against Breaking Benjamin . According to the lawsuit , Hummel requested earlier that year to take a paternity leave to be with his wife during the birth of their first child , to which all members of the band agreed and hired Kevin Soffera as a temporary substitute on drums . However , Burnley later called Hummel and terminated him , citing chemistry issues . In the lawsuit , Hummel contended wrongful termination and lack of compensation for profits accrued by We Are Not Alone and other non @-@ album tracks that appeared in Halo 2 and National Treasure 2 . The band 's manager , Larry Mazer ( who was also named in the lawsuit ) , asserted that the lawsuit was " totally frivolous " and his termination had " nothing to do with the paternity leave . " Mazer said the band received no payment for the Halo 2 appearance , adding that the song was included for promotional reasons and Burnley was happy to have it in the video game . The band received minimal payment for the National Treasure 2 appearance , and Mazer stated that otherwise , " [ Hummel ] is 100 per cent current . " Ben " B.C. " Vaught served as a sit @-@ in drummer for the band , and they later toured with 3 Doors Down and Staind in November 2005 . The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount in April 2006 . 
 = = = Phobia ( 2005 – 2007 ) = = = 
 After the departure of Jeremy Hummel , Breaking Benjamin auditioned fifteen drummers , of whom Chad Szeliga stood out for his ability as a stage performer and the fact that he had " serious problem @-@ solving skills " , according to Burnley . The group 's next album , Phobia , was again produced by Bendeth and was the first to be recorded with Szeliga . The concept of the album is dedicated to Burnley 's various phobias . The cover of the album depicts a winged man suspended over a runway , which represents the singer 's fear of flying . Burnley also suffers from death anxiety , a fear of the dark , driving anxiety , and <unk> . Burnley cites his fear of flying as for why he did not perform overseas , saying , " I 'll go as far as a boat will take me " , though at the time the band 's record label had not facilitated travel by boat . Phobia 's " Intro " and " Outro " tracks feature sound effects of an airport intercom , airplane <unk> , car doors , and crowd panic . 
 Phobia was released on August 8 , 2006 to commercial success . The album sold more than 131 @,@ 000 copies in its first week of sales and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 . It went gold on November 8 , 2006 , then platinum on May 21 , 2009 . Its lead single , " The Diary of Jane " , peaked at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart and was the fastest single added to radio playlists in the history of Hollywood Records , later receiving a double platinum certification on November 24 , 2015 . " Breath " , the record 's second single , spent seven weeks at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart , and went platinum on November 24 , 2015 . The third single , " Until the End " , peaked at No. 6 on the same chart , and became a gold single on February 11 , 2014 . 
 In February 2007 in support of Phobia , AXS TV ( then known as HDNet ) aired a one @-@ hour Breaking Benjamin concert from Stabler Arena in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania . The broadcast recording was included on the re @-@ released Phobia DVD in April , billed as " The Homecoming " . A music video was created for " Breath " which was made from footage of the song 's performance at the show . Breaking Benjamin followed with Spring and Fall tours alongside Three Days Grace , accompanied by Puddle of Mudd during the Spring tour , and Seether , Skillet , and Red during the Fall tour . 
 Phobia received mixed critical reception . It received praise for general composition and musicianship , but received criticism for a lack of originality . AllMusic 's Corey Apar found the album " nothing if not consistent , " and while generally regarding the disc with positive sentiments , noted a lack of distinction from the " rest of the post @-@ grunge / alt @-@ metal pack " aside from " a certain charm " . IGN 's Spence D. gave the disc a negative review , citing tedium and lack of vocal distinction , feeling that the group 's " intersection of hard rock and emo @-@ oriented introspection " is " not a bad thing , but also not a terribly memorable or earth @-@ shattering one , either . " However , the writer praised the musicianship of Fink , Klepaski , and Szeliga , ultimately giving the album a score of 5 @.@ 7 out of 10 . Entertainment Weekly graded the album C + and noted its angst @-@ ridden themes , saying , " as pathological angst goes , it 's expertly done , with expansive choruses and epic riffs — not that that matters , when , like , we 're all going to die cold and alone anyway . " 
 = = = Dear Agony ( 2009 – 2010 ) = = = 
 Breaking Benjamin began working on a fourth album , titled Dear Agony , in 2009 . It was the first album Burnley wrote while completely sober . In 2007 , Burnley experienced fatigue and <unk> following three consecutive days of no sleep and heavy drinking , after which he decided to remain sober . Burnley acknowledged an improved clarity and coherence within Dear Agony due to his sobriety . The album cover features Burnley 's brain scan , representing the recurrent themes on Dear Agony related to the singer 's chronic illnesses caused by alcohol consumption . 
 Burnley collaborated with then @-@ Red guitarist Jasen Rauch on various tracks for Dear Agony : The two equally wrote together the songs " Without You " and " Hopeless " , and Rauch wrote the outro for " I Will Not Bow " , also helping write " Lights Out " . Burnley said of the collaboration , " I love writing with him because he does stuff exactly like I would 've done , " adding , " writing @-@ wise , we 're like the same person . " 
 Dear Agony was released on September 9 , 2009 , and peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 . The disc initially outsold its predecessor in its first week , moving more than 134 @,@ 000 copies . It ultimately achieved gold certification on February 16 , 2010 . The album 's lead single " I Will Not Bow " reached No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart , and went platinum on November 24 , 2015 . The other two singles , " Lights Out " and " Give Me a Sign " , peaked at No. 9 and No. 6 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart , respectively ( the latter of which also receiving a gold certification on November 24 , 2015 ) . 
 Breaking Benjamin toured in support of the album in January and February 2010 with Three Days Grace and Flyleaf , then with Red , Chevelle , and Thousand Foot Krutch in March 2010 . In April , Breaking Benjamin began touring with Nickelback , Shinedown , and Sick Puppies on their Dark Horse Tour . Prior to the last show of the Dark Horse Tour , Burnley stated he was ill and therefore no longer able to tour in support of the album , placing the band on hiatus . After internet rumors began to circulate that the band had broken up , Burnley released a statement " officially letting everyone know that Breaking Benjamin has not broken up . " 
 Dear Agony received mixed critical reception . AllMusic 's James Monger gave the album a positive review , stating it " feels a lot like their first three " , noting a consistency that " feels like a well @-@ oiled machine . " The disc received a negative review from Consequence of Sound 's Alex Young , who complained of over @-@ production and the disc 's sell @-@ out nature at the hands of three @-@ time Breaking Benjamin producer David Bendeth : " Dear Agony is the unfortunate side effect of a trend in ' producer ' David Bendeth 's world , training wild chimpanzees to be more tasteful whilst handling silverware " , ultimately giving the record a half @-@ star " for teaching Breaking Benjamin 's peers who not to hire for production credit . " About Entertainment gave the record a mixed review , feeling that " Though it lacks the breakthrough singles of Phobia , Dear Agony does have its moments , " adding , " frustratingly , Dear Agony never reaches greatness , settling for an admirable competency that 's still the envy of many of their contemporaries . " 
 = = = Hiatus and Shallow Bay ( 2010 – 2013 ) = = = 
 In March 2010 , Hollywood Records requested that the band produce two new master recordings and a greatest hits album , and also sought permission to release a new version of the hit song " Blow Me Away " featuring <unk> Duran of <unk> . In May 2011 , Fink and Klepaski granted the record company 's requests after they were offered a $ 100 @,@ 000 payment . Burnley , alleging that Fink and Klepaski acted unilaterally on both the song remix and the compilation album , not informing him or the band 's management , fired the two via email , demanding at least $ 250 @,@ 000 in punitive fees and compensatory damages , as well as the exclusive right to the name Breaking Benjamin . Fink and Klepaski 's attorneys stated the two " dispute and strictly deny " Burnley 's allegations , instead asserting that a January 2009 agreement ( allowing Burnley to dismiss them for " just cause " ) was no longer valid because of the singer 's status of indefinite hiatus . The case was ordered by a judge to arbitration . Burnley 's attorney , Brian Caplan , told the Associated Press , " The relationship between Mr. Burnley and the two other members of the band has ended ... Mr. Burnley intends on moving forward using the name Breaking Benjamin and the band will continue . It just won 't continue in its prior configuration . He 's not retiring . " 
 In August 2011 , Hollywood Records scheduled the release of the Shallow Bay : The Best of Breaking Benjamin compilation album , featuring every single from the band 's catalog , including the remix of " Blow Me Away " . A two @-@ disc deluxe edition was released alongside it , with the second disc containing altered versions of b @-@ sides and rarities . Burnley publicly opposed the album 's release , saying content had been altered without his consent and did not meet his standards . Burnley later elaborated , saying that the rarities were taken off of his laptop without his consent , and were intended for in @-@ studio reference and not public release , but that he was otherwise content with previously @-@ released tracks on Shallow Bay . The album was released on August 16 , 2011 and peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard 200 , also topping the Hard Rock Albums chart in 2011 , 2012 , and 2013 . The disc received positive critical reception . The Daily Trojan 's Krishna <unk> praised it for balance and a progressive retrospective history . AllMusic 's Gregory Heaney felt similarly , saying , " Shallow Bay is a great jumping @-@ on point for new fans , capturing the band at their height delivering some of their best moments in one convenient package . For older fans , this collection may just serve as a reminder of a crucial turning point in Breaking Benjamin 's career . " 
 In April 2013 , Burnley announced that the dispute involving Fink and Klepaski was resolved and that he would retain the right to continue the band under the name Breaking Benjamin . Three days later , Szeliga announced his departure , citing creative differences . 
 = = = Return and Dark Before Dawn ( 2014 – present ) = = = 
 In August 2014 , Breaking Benjamin announced via Facebook that the band reformed as a quintet with , except for Burnley , all new members , including : Dear Agony co @-@ writer Jasen Rauch ( guitar , originally from Red ) ; Keith Wallen ( guitar and backing vocals , originally from Adelitas Way ) ; Aaron Bruch ( bass and backing vocals ) ; and Shaun Foist ( drums , originally from Picture Me Broken ) . Burnley said of the lineup : " Everybody that 's in the band now is deliberately handpicked , " noting that " Keith [ Wallen ] and Aaron [ Bruch ] are really , really amazing singers . That 's kind of what the band always needed . " On March 18 , 2015 , a new single entitled " Failure " as well as a new album , Dark Before Dawn , were announced for release on March 23 and June 23 , respectively . 
 The new lineup debuted with acoustic shows in late 2014 , then went on a four @-@ venue winter tour in the north @-@ eastern United States . The band afterward announced 2015 spring , summer , and fall tour dates , supported by bands such as Young Guns and <unk> . In July 2015 , the band announced their first overseas performance , in which they headlined a four @-@ day cruise venue in February 2016 along with Yngwie Malmsteen , Zakk Wylde , Flyleaf , et al . The band also performed on a joint U.S. tour with Shinedown in October and November along with Sevendust , and proceeded to play further outside of the United States in June 2016 at venues such as the Download Festival in the United Kingdom , Rock am Ring in Germany , and Nova Rock in Austria . 
 Burnley explained that writing for Dark Before Dawn was intermittent and fragmentary , taking place throughout the hiatus , though it was toward the end of the hiatus in 2013 when it became cohesive . After growing frustrated with the lack of answers regarding his health condition , Burnley decided to abandon searching for a diagnosis and focus on the album . Recorded and produced at a personal studio of Burnley 's , Dark Before Dawn is the first album with the front man credited as the producer . The singer stated that " I would say that I did the same amount of producing on this album as I 've done on other albums , just never had my name [ on it ] " , adding , " You know , I 'm not doing anything different here than I have done in the past . Why shouldn 't I be known to be doing it ? " 
 Within an hour of pre @-@ order availability , Dark Before Dawn reached No. 1 on the rock albums chart on iTunes and No. 3 on the overall album chart . It sold 135 @,@ 000 pure album units and 141 @,@ 000 equivalent album units in its first week , debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 , making the album the group 's heretofore most successful sales effort . The disc 's lead single " Failure " spent nine weeks at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart as well . Billboard 's Jason Lipshutz felt the album 's success was " eyebrow @-@ raising " , noting that , in addition to the band 's lineup change , " 135 @,@ 000 in pure album sales is a hefty number in 2015 — it 's a bigger number than the respective bows of recent Madonna , ASAP Rocky , and Kelly Clarkson albums " . Joe <unk> , program director of active rock station <unk> @-@ FM , added that , " They 've always been a top @-@ level band for the format , but not quite on the level of Disturbed or Shinedown or bands like that . They always seem to put out hit records without getting the kind of recognition that they deserved . " Forbes ' Hugh McIntyre writes that runner @-@ up Tori Kelly 's 75 @,@ 000 copies " puts Breaking Benjamin 's figures into perspective " and that despite " a pretty extensive lineup change , it looks like fans were awaiting their return with open arms . " 
 The album was met with mostly positive critical reception , many critics praising the album for staying true to the group 's sound , though others criticized it for sounding too similar to previous material . Dan Marsicano from About Entertainment stated , " Burnley could have made his creation just another dose of the glitzy , overproduced crap that is heard on every rock radio station in the world . Instead , Breaking Benjamin hardly deviate from the hooky jams that were present on Dear Agony . " Conversely , AllMusic 's James Monger felt that " it 's hard to conceal the fact that most of these songs are nearly interchangeable with the band 's older material . " Revolver 's Jeremy Borjon felt that " the music 's true force only becomes apparent through deeper and repeated listenings , as the songs , on the surface , have a tendency to blend into one another . " 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Musical style = = = 
 Breaking Benjamin 's musical style is primarily classified as hard rock and alternative rock , more specifically post @-@ grunge and alternative metal , and has commonly been noted for its consistency . Corey Apar felt that " Breaking Benjamin are nothing if not consistent " , and Alex Young felt that " Breaking Benjamin is one of the few modern rock bands on the radio that , if you have heard any song in its catalog prior , could be immediately recognized . " Despite a complete lineup change prior to the release of Dark Before Dawn , Dan Marsicano stated , " Breaking Benjamin hardly deviate from the hooky jams that were present on Dear Agony . They have had an established sound since their breakout We Are Not Alone — hard @-@ edged riffs with emotional upheaval — and that isn 't tampered with on Dark Before Dawn . " 
 Their style is described by Apar as " mixing heavy hard rock dynamics with a moody demeanor that never slips into full @-@ on dejection . " Spence D. characterizes the band as " [ persisting ] in delivering crunching guitars topped off with somewhat generic , angst @-@ ridden [ lyrics ] that waffle between being plaintive and aggressive " with vocals that " [ deliver ] just the right amount of emotion , fluctuating between contemplative subjectivity and growling anger . " Young felt that Breaking Benjamin is " indicative of early ' 00s modern rock , while also now and then being more Filter @-@ esque or technically proficient , primarily on guitar during 2002 's Saturate , and from then on with bass and drums . " 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 Burnley is the primary songwriter in the band . Music industry attorney and author Martin <unk> writes that " it 's unmistakably clear that Burnley started the group , is the creative force behind the group and essentially dictates the group 's decisions . " Bands such as Nirvana , Live , Bush , Pearl Jam , Stone Temple Pilots , and The Beatles have been cited as influences . Burnley remarked in 2009 that while the other band members did contribute , it was " always left up to me to put all the pieces together and make it so that it 's even anything at all . " However , Burnley expressed how he considered Rauch to be his " writing partner " during Dear Agony , and that he looked forward to writing with him in the future . After joining the band in 2014 as part of the new lineup , Rauch provided writing contributions on Dark Before Dawn , writing the intro and outro tracks as well as riffs on two other tracks . Burnley revealed in 2015 that the whole band would write songs for Breaking Benjamin in the future , and that " It just so happens that when they came on board for this album , I was already 95 percent done " , adding , " I 'm really looking forward to writing the next one all together . " 
 Breaking Benjamin 's lyrical content evolved as a product of Burnley 's sobriety , the front man noting that the lyricism in Dear Agony is more thought out . Rito Asilo of the Inquirer writes that Burnley " owes the improved clarity and coherence in Breaking Benjamin 's music to sobriety . " Burnley has said that before sobriety , anything that made sense thematically was a coincidence , and that he would take shots if he were dissatisfied with a lyric . Breaking Benjamin 's lyrics have been noted for their vague , angst @-@ heavy themes , Burnley saying that " I try to keep my writing vague so people can draw their own conclusions . " 
 = = = Live performance = = = 
 Breaking Benjamin 's live sound has corresponded with lineup arrangements . The band originally lacked backing vocalists and tertiary instrumentation , requiring them to rely on pre @-@ recorded tracks during live performances . However , the band was noted for a change in such respects with the second iteration of the band assembled in 2014 . Bruch and Wallen were selected in part for their ability as singers , providing all backing vocals on both new studio recordings and during live shows . Burnley noted that it was important to add two new singers in order to replicate vocal techniques such as three @-@ part harmonies , octave range , and layered vocals . Rauch , acting as a third guitarist , provides the band with " more freedom while simultaneously thickening up their live sound " , as some songs feature three guitar parts , layered guitars , or are meant to feature Burnley only performing vocals , such as " I Will Not Bow " and " Lights Out " . Foist utilizes Roland V @-@ Kit electronic drums during live performances and triggers certain sounds as heard in studio recordings , such as the piano notes in " Breakdown " . Additionally , Rauch is equipped with a Roland GR @-@ 55 guitar synthesizer allowing him to play orchestral strings and choir sound effects , further eliminating any reliance on pre @-@ recorded tracks .

 = Polish – Russian War of 1792 = 
 The Polish – Russian War of 1792 ( also , War of the Second Partition , and in Polish sources , War in Defence of the Constitution ( Polish : wojna w <unk> Konstytucji 3 maja ) ) was fought between the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth on one side , and the Targowica Confederation ( conservative nobility of the Commonwealth opposed to the new Constitution of 3 May 1791 ) and the Russian Empire under Catherine the Great on the other . 
 The war took place in two theaters : northern in Lithuania and southern in Ukraine . In both , the Polish forces retreated before the numerically superior Russian forces , though they offered significantly more resistance in the south , thanks to the effective leadership of Polish commanders Prince Józef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko . During the three @-@ month @-@ long struggle several battles were fought , but no side scored a decisive victory . The largest success of the Polish forces was the defeat of one of the Russian formations at the Battle of Zieleńce on 18 June ; in the aftermath of the battle the Polish highest military award , Virtuti Militari , was established . The war ended when the Polish King Stanisław August Poniatowski decided to seek a diplomatic solution , asked for a ceasefire with the Russians and joined the Targowica Confederation , as demanded by the Russian Empire . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Decline of the Commonwealth = = = 
 By the early 18th century , the magnates of Poland and Lithuania controlled the state – or rather , they managed to ensure that no reforms would be carried out that might weaken their privileged status ( the " Golden Freedoms " ) . Through the abuse of the liberum veto rule which enabled any deputy to paralyze the Sejm ( Commonwealth 's parliament ) proceedings , deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers or those simply content to believe they were living in an unprecedented " Golden Age " , paralysed the Commonwealth 's government for over a century . 
 The idea of reforming the Commonwealth gained traction from the mid @-@ 17th century ; it was however viewed with suspicion not only by its magnates but also by neighboring countries , which had been content with the deterioration of the Commonwealth and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders . With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16 @,@ 000 , it was easy for its neighbors to intervene directly ( The Imperial Russian Army numbered 300 @,@ 000 troops overall ; The Prussian Army and Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire , 200 @,@ 000 each ) . 
 = = = Attempts at reform = = = 
 A major opportunity for reform presented itself during the " Great Sejm " of 1788 – 92 . Poland 's neighbors were preoccupied with wars and unable to intervene forcibly in Polish affairs . Russian Empire and Archduchy of Austria were engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire ( the Russo – Turkish War , 1787 – 1792 and the Austro @-@ Turkish War , 1787 – 1791 ) ; the Russians also found themselves simultaneously fighting in the Russo @-@ Swedish War , 1788 – 1790 . A new alliance between the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth and Prussia seeming to provide security against Russian intervention , and on 3 May 1791 the new constitution was read and adopted to overwhelming popular support . 
 With the wars between Turkey and Russia and Sweden and Russia having ended , Tsarina Catherine was furious over the adoption of the document , which she believed threatened Russian influence in Poland . Russia had viewed Poland as a de facto protectorate . " The worst possible news have arrived from Warsaw : the Polish king has become almost sovereign " was the reaction of one of Russia 's chief foreign policy authors , Alexander Bezborodko , when he learned of the new constitution . The Kingdom of Prussia was also strongly opposed to the new Polish constitution , and Polish diplomats received a note that the new constitution changed the Polish state so much that Prussia did not consider its obligations binding . Just like Russia , Prussia was concerned that the newly strengthened Polish state could become a threat and the Prussian Foreign Minister , Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg @-@ Kehnert , clearly and with rare candor told Poles that Prussia did not support the constitution and refused to help the Commonwealth in any form , even as a mediator , as it was not in Prussia 's interest to see the Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten Prussia in some future . The Prussian statesman Ewald von Hertzberg expressed the fears of European conservatives : " The Poles have given the coup de grâce to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution " , elaborating that a strong Commonwealth would likely demand the return of the lands Prussia acquired in the First Partition . 
 The Constitution was not adopted without dissent in the Commonwealth itself , either . <unk> who had opposed the constitution draft from the start , namely Franciszek Ksawery Branicki , Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki , Seweryn Rzewuski , and Szymon and Józef Kossakowski , asked Tsarina Catherine to intervene and restore their privileges such as the Russian @-@ guaranteed Cardinal Laws abolished under the new statute . To that end these magnates formed the Targowica Confederation . The Confederation 's proclamation , prepared in St. Petersburg in January 1792 , criticized the constitution for contributing to , in their own words , " contagion of democratic ideas " following " the fatal examples set in Paris " . It asserted that " The parliament ... has broken all fundamental laws , swept away all liberties of the gentry and on the third of May 1791 turned into a revolution and a conspiracy . " The Confederates declared an intention to overcome this revolution . We " can do nothing but turn trustingly to Tsarina Catherine , a distinguished and fair empress , our neighboring friend and ally " , who " respects the nation 's need for well @-@ being and always offers it a helping hand " , they wrote . The Confederates aligned with Tsarina Catherine and asked her for military intervention . On 18 May 1792 Russian ambassador to Poland , Yakov Bulgakov , delivered a declaration of war to the Polish Foreign Minister Joachim <unk> . Russian armies entered Poland and Lithuania on the same day , starting the war . 
 = = Opposing forces = = 
 The Russian army numbered nearly 98 @,@ 000 . It was commanded by generals Mikhail Krechetnikov and Mikhail Kakhovsky . The Russians also had an advantage in combat experience . The Russian plan called for Kakhovsky to advance through Ukraine , taking Kamieniec Podolski , Chełm and Lublin , and approach Polish capital of Warsaw from the south . Krechetnikov was to advance through Minsk , Wilno , Brześć Litewski and Białystok , and approach Warsaw from the north , where he was to link with Kakhovsky . Whereas the Russians had good intelligence network in Poland , and were mostly aware of Polish army distribution and strength ; the Poles had much less intelligence , receiving contradictory and often erroneous reports , and unsure whether the war would even start up to the point the Russian troops crossed the border . 
 Stanisław August Poniatowski , King of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth , was the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Polish forces , but in practice he delegated this position to his nephew , Prince Józef Poniatowski . Poniatowski had in theory at his disposal a 48 @,@ 000 strong Crown army and the Lithuanian army more than half that size to confront them . In practice , Polish forces , still forming following the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May ( which specified an army size of 100 @,@ 000 ) numbered only 37 @,@ 000 . The army was in the midst of reorganizing , with key documents on unit numbers and composition passed as recently as in April ; it was also short on equipment and experienced personnel . 
 In the southeast corner of the country – the Ukrainian lands – the Polish forces were initially concentrated separately in three regions of the expected front , under Tadeusz Kościuszko , Michał Wielhorski and Prince Poniatowski himself . The Polish Crown army in Ukraine , led by Prince Poniatowski , and supported by Kościuszko , was about 17 @,@ 000 , 21 @,@ 000 or 24 @,@ 000 strong ( <unk> distinguishes between the primary force of 17 @,@ 000 and Prince Michał Lubomirski 's reserve division , of 4 @,@ 500 ) . They were faced on this southeastern war theater with a nearly four times larger enemy army under General Mikhail Kakhovsky , who had about 64 @,@ 000 men under his command . Kakhovsky 's forces were divided into four corps : 1st , 17 @,@ 000 strong , under the command of General Mikhail <unk> @-@ Kutuzov , 2nd , under General Ivan Dunin , 3rd , under General Otto Wilhelm <unk> , and 4th , under General Andrei <unk> . The Targowica Confederates did not represent any real strength ; and their attempts to gather popular support in Poland upon crossing borders failed miserably , with only few dozens joining at first ; later the number would grow but not significantly , and even the Russians saw them as not having any military value , keeping them from frontlines . 
 In Lithuania , Commonwealth Lithuanian Army numbered about 15 @,@ 000 , with an additional Crown detachment of about 3 @,@ 000 . They were commanded by Duke Louis of Württemberg . Württemberg made no plans for the war , and the troops were not readied for action by the time the war started . The Russian army in that theatre under General Mikhail Krechetnikov was 33 @,@ 700 strong or 38 @,@ 000 strong . The Russian army was also divided into four corps : 1st under one of Targowica Confederate leaders , Szymon Kossakowski 7 @,@ 300 strong , 2nd under General Boris Mellin , 7 @,@ 000 strong , 3rd under General Yuri <unk> , 15 @,@ 400 strong , and 4th under General Ivan <unk> , 8 @,@ 300 strong . 
 Additional Polish forces , about 8 @,@ 000 strong , were to concentrate in Warsaw under command of King Poniatowski as reserve . 
 Tadeusz Kościuszko proposed a plan where the entire Polish army would be concentrated and would engage one of the Russian armies , in order to assure numerical parity and to boost the morale of mostly inexperienced Polish forces with a quick victory ; this plan was however rejected by Prince Poniatowski . ( Only a few months ago , however , both commanders had the opposite idea – Poniatowski wanted the troops concentrated , and Kościuszko , dispersed ) . Poniatowski also planned to avoid serious engagements in the first phase of the war , hoping to receive the expected Prussian reinforcements of 30 @,@ 000 which would bring parity to the two sides .

 = = = Southern theater = = = 
 First Russian forces crossed the border in Ukraine on the night of 18 / 19 May 1792 . The Russians in that theater would encounter significantly more resistance than they expected , as Commonwealth 's top commanders , Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko were stationed there . Kościuszko joined Prince Poniatowski near Janów on 29 May . The Crown Army was judged too weak to oppose the four columns of enemy armies advancing into West Ukraine and began a fighting withdrawal to the western side of the Southern Bug River , towards <unk> and <unk> , with <unk> commanding the rear guard . Poniatowski , in face of a significant numerical inferiority of his forces , and promised reinforcements by King Poniatowski , decided to abandon Ukraine and move to Volhynia , where <unk> was to be fortified as a major defensive point , and where Lubomirski was tasked with gathering supplies . 
 On 14 June Wielhorski 's unit was defeated at the Battle of <unk> . On 17 June Poniatowski finally received awaited reinforcements , about 2 @,@ 000 troops led by Michał Lubomirski . Next day the Poles , led by Prince Poniatowski , defeated one of the Russian formations of general <unk> <unk> at the Battle of Zieleńce on 18 June . The victory was celebrated by King Poniatowski , who sent the new Virtuti Militari medals for the campaign leaders and soldiers , as " the first since John III Sobieski " . 
 The Russian forces , however , kept advancing . The Polish army , under the command of Józef Poniatowski , was still retreating in order , yielding to the more powerful enemy as necessary to avoid annihilation , according to the Prince 's judgement . In early July , near Dubno , Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko were betrayed by Michał Lubomirski , who was tasked with King Poniatowski with resupplying the troops ; instead Lubomirski joined the Russian side , and either hid the supplies for the Polish army , or outright passed them to the Russians . Lubomirski , however , was a powerful magnate , and it took until late May for the King to officially relieve him of his command . Within about a month of the Russian invasion , the Poles have mostly retreated from Ukraine . On 7 July Kościuszko 's forces fought a delaying battle with the Russians at Volodymyr @-@ Volynskyi ( Battle of Włodzimierz ) . Meanwhile , Poniatowski 's army retreated to the Bug River , where Kościuszko 's units fought the Battle of Dubienka on 18 July to a draw . With about 5 @,@ 300 troops Kościuszko defeated the attack of 25 @,@ 000 Russians under General Michail <unk> . <unk> then had to retreat from Dubienka , as the Russians begun flanking his positions crossing the nearby Austrian border . Although the Poles had to retreat from the Bug River line , they were not defeated so far , and a decisive battle or battles at more favorable locations closer to Warsaw were expected . 
 = = = Northern theater = = = 
 In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania the Russians crossed the Commonwealth border four days later than in the south , on 22 May . Poland 's ally , the Kingdom of Prussia , broke its alliance with Poland and the Prussian commander of the Lithuanian army , Duke Württemberg , betrayed the Polish @-@ Lithuanian cause by refusing to fight the Russians . He never reached the frontlines , feigned illness in Wołczyn , and issued contradictory orders to his troops . 
 Thus the Army of Lithuania did little to oppose the advancing Russians , and kept withdrawing before their advance . Minsk was abandoned , after some skirmishes , on 31 May . Only after a change of commander on 4 June , did the Army , now under General Józef Judycki , try to stand and fight the Russians . The Russians however defeated Judycki at the battle of Mir on 11 June and kept advancing through the Grand Duchy . The Commonwealth army retreated towards Grodno . On 14 June the Russians took Wilno , after only a small skirmish with local garrison ; on 19 June , incompetently defended Nieśwież ; and on 20 June , Kaunas , this time without any opposition . Judycki , disgraced , was replaced by Michał Zabiełło on 23 June . Nonetheless , since Mir , no decisive engagements occurred in the northern theater , as Polish army withdrew in relative order towards Warsaw , after minor defeat at <unk> , eventually taking defensive positions along the Bug river near Brest . Russians took Grodno on 5 July and Białystok on 17 July . On 23 July the Russians took Brest , defeating the local garrison , but on 24 they were defeated near <unk> @-@ Wieś ; this last battle was the first significant Commonwealth victory on the northern front . 
 = = = War ends = = = 
 While Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko considered the outcome of the war still open , and were planning to use the combined Polish @-@ Lithuanian forces to defeat the still separate Russian forces , King Poniatowski , with the consent of the Guardians of the Laws ( cabinet of ministers ) decided to ask for a ceasefire . Tsarina Catherine demanded that the King Poniatowski joins the pro @-@ Russian aristocratic faction , the Targowica Confederation ; with his cabinet split , he gave in to her demand around 22 – 23 July , which effectively forced Prince Poniatowski to terminate military resistance . The last military confrontation of the war was fought on 26 July at <unk> in Lublin province , where an enemy attack was repelled by Polish cavalry led by Poniatowski . 
 At the time King Poniatowski decided to sue for peace , the Polish army was still in good fighting condition , not suffering from any major defeat nor from lack of supplies . King Poniatowski thought that due to Russian numerical superiority defeat was nonetheless imminent , and more could be gained through negotiations with the Russians , with whom he hoped a new alliance could be formed . Although subsequent events would prove him wrong , the question of whether this could have been foreseen , and prevented through continued military resistance , has been subject to much debate among historians . 
 The Polish military was widely dissatisfied with the ceasefire ; Kościuszko , Prince Poniatowski and many others would criticize the King 's decision and many , including Kościuszko , would resign their commission in the coming weeks . Prince Poniatowski even considered rebelling against his uncle 's orders , and even issued orders to bring the King to the army 's camp by force if necessary , as was postulated by the more radical faction . Ultimately he decided not to continue fighting against his uncle 's will , and the order was rescinded at the last moment before the departure of the group charged with capturing the King . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Most Polish historians agree that the Polish capitulation was a mistake both from the military perspective , and the political one . In the realm of military , the Poles had reasonable chances to defend the Vistula river line , and exhaust the Russian invading forces . From the political one , showing willingness to fight could have persuaded the partitioning powers that their plan was too costly . 
 King Poniatowski 's hopes that the capitulation will allow an acceptable diplomatic solution to be worked out were soon dashed . With new deputies bribed or intimidated by the Russian troops , a new session of parliament , known as the Grodno Sejm , took place , in fall 1793 . On 23 November 1793 , it concluded its deliberations under duress , annulling the constitution and acceding to the Second Partition . Russia took 250 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 97 @,@ 000 sq mi ) , while Prussia took 58 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 22 @,@ 000 sq mi ) of the Commonwealth 's territory . This event reduced Poland 's population to only one @-@ third of what it was before the First Partition . The rump state was garrisoned by Russian troops and its independence was strongly curtailed . 
 This outcome came also as a surprise to most of the Targowica Confederates , who had wished only to restore the status quo ante bellum ( Commonwealth magnate @-@ favoring Golden Freedoms ) and had expected that the overthrow of the 3 May Constitution would achieve that end , and nothing more . The last bid to restore the reformed Commonwealth came with the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794 . The uprising failed and resulted in the Third Partition in 1795 , in which the country lost all its remaining territories and the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist . 
 = Aliens ( film ) = 
 Aliens is a 1986 American military science fiction action horror film written and directed by James Cameron , produced by his then @-@ wife Gale Anne Hurd , and starring Sigourney Weaver , Carrie Henn , Michael Biehn , Paul Reiser , Lance Henriksen , William Hope , and Bill Paxton . It is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien and the second installment in the Alien franchise . The film follows Weaver 's character Ellen Ripley as she returns to the planet where her crew encountered the hostile Alien creature , this time accompanied by a unit of space marines . 
 Gordon Carroll , David Giler and Walter Hill of Brandywine Productions , who produced the first film and the later sequels , were executive producers of Aliens . They were interested in a follow @-@ up to Alien as soon as its 1979 release , but the new management at 20th Century Fox postponed those plans until 1983 . That year Brandywine picked Cameron to write after reading his script for The Terminator ; when that film became a hit in 1984 , Fox greenlit Aliens with Cameron as director and a budget of approximately $ 18 million . The script was written with a war film tone influenced by the Vietnam War to contrast the horror motifs of the original Alien . It was filmed in England at Pinewood Studios and at a decommissioned power plant in Acton , London . 
 Aliens grossed $ 180 million worldwide . It was nominated for seven Academy Awards , including a Best Actress nomination for Sigourney Weaver , winning both Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects ( that latter delivered to special effects supervisor John Richardson ) . It won eight Saturn Awards , including Best Science Fiction Film , Best Actress for Weaver and Best Direction and Best Writing for Cameron . Aliens is considered one of the best films in its genre . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Ellen Ripley ( Sigourney Weaver ) is rescued after drifting through space in stasis for 57 years . She is debriefed by her employers at the Weyland @-@ Yutani Corporation over the destruction of her ship , the Nostromo ; they are skeptical of her claims that an Alien killed the ship 's crew and forced her to destroy the ship . 
 Zeta Reticuli , the <unk> LV @-@ 426 , where the <unk> Nostromo encountered the alien eggs , is now home to the terraforming colony <unk> [ sic ] Hope . When contact is lost with <unk> Hope , Weyland @-@ Yutani representative Carter Burke ( Paul Reiser ) and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ( William Hope ) ask Ripley to accompany Burke and a Colonial Marine unit to investigate the disturbance . Traumatized by her encounter with the Alien , Ripley initially refuses , but she relents after experiencing recurring nightmares about the creature ; she makes Burke promise to destroy , and not capture , the Aliens . Aboard the spaceship USS Sulaco , she is introduced to the Colonial Marines and the android Bishop , toward whom Ripley is initially hostile following her experience with the traitorous android Ash aboard the Nostromo . 
 A dropship delivers the expedition to the surface of LV @-@ 426 , where they find the colony deserted . Inside , they find makeshift barricades and signs of a struggle , but no bodies ; two live facehuggers in containment tanks in the medical lab ; and a survivor , a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt who used the ventilation system to evade capture or death . The crew uses the colony 's computer to locate the colonists grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station . They head to the location , descending into corridors covered in Alien secretions . 
 At the center of the station , the marines find the colonists cocooned , serving as incubators for the Aliens ' offspring . When the marines kill a newborn Alien , the Aliens are roused and ambush the marines , killing and capturing several . When the inexperienced Gorman panics , Ripley takes control of their vehicle and rams it through the nest to rescue marines Hicks , Hudson , and Vasquez . Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors , but a stowaway Alien kills the pilots , causing it to crash . Ripley , Newt , Burke and the remaining marines barricade themselves inside the colony . 
 Ripley discovers that Burke deliberately sent the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship where the Nostromo crew first encountered the Alien eggs , believing he could become wealthy by recovering Alien specimens for use as biological weapons . She threatens to expose him , but Bishop informs the group of a greater danger : the power plant was damaged during the battle , and will soon detonate with the force of a 40 @-@ megaton thermonuclear weapon . He volunteers to crawl through several hundred meters of piping conduits to reach the colony 's transmitter and remotely pilot the Sulaco 's remaining dropship to the surface . 
 Ripley and Newt fall asleep in the medical laboratory , awakening to find themselves locked in the room with the two facehuggers , which have been released from their tanks . Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the marines , who rescue them and kill the creatures . Ripley accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers so that they would impregnate her and Newt , allowing him to smuggle the Alien embryos past Earth 's quarantine , and of planning to kill the rest of the marines in hypersleep during the return trip so that no one could contradict his version of events . Before the marines can kill Burke , the electricity is cut and Aliens assault through the ceiling . Hudson , Burke , Vasquez and Gorman are all killed and Newt is captured . 
 Ripley and an injured Hicks reach Bishop in the second dropship , but Ripley refuses to abandon Newt . She hastily assembles a weapon and rescues Newt from the hive in the processing station , where the two encounter the Alien queen in her egg chamber . Ripley destroys the eggs , enraging the queen , who tears free from her ovipositor . Pursued by the queen , Ripley and Newt rendezvous with Bishop and Hicks on the dropship . All four escape moments before the colony is consumed by the nuclear blast . 
 On the Sulaco , Ripley and Bishop 's relief at their escape is interrupted when the Alien queen , stowed away on the dropship 's landing gear , tears Bishop in two . The queen advances on Newt , but Ripley clashes with her using an <unk> cargo @-@ loader and expels it through an airlock . Ripley , Newt , Hicks and the badly damaged Bishop enter hypersleep for the return to Earth .

 David Giler declared that back in 1979 Brandywine Productions were intent on " immediately making a sequel " to Alien , having the full support of 20th Century Fox president Alan Ladd , Jr .. However , that year Ladd left amidst Fox 's transition to new owners Marc Rich and Marvin Davis , and the new studio management had no interest in the sequel . Giler accused new president Norman Levy of being the one that held back the film 's production ; Levy would later declare that " It was a movie I wanted to make , " but he felt another Alien would prove too costly . In the meantime , Giler and partners Walter Hill and Gordon Carroll sued Fox regarding the disbursement of the Alien profits . By the time the lawsuit was settled , in 1983 , Fox had new executives that got interested in continuing Alien . Giler pitched the project to one of the executives as a cross between Hill 's Southern Comfort and The Magnificent Seven . 
 While the producers and development executive Larry Wilson sought a writer for Alien II , Wilson came across James Cameron 's screenplay for The Terminator , and passed the script to Giler feeling Cameron was apt for the job . Giler then approached Cameron , who was completing pre @-@ production of The Terminator . A fan of the original Alien , Cameron was interested in crafting a sequel and entered a self @-@ imposed seclusion to brainstorm a concept for Alien II . After four days Cameron produced an initial 45 @-@ page treatment , although the Fox management put the film on hiatus , as some disliked the pitch and they felt that Alien had not generated enough profit to warrant a sequel . A scheduling conflict with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger caused filming of The Terminator to be delayed by nine months ( as Schwarzenegger was filming Conan the Destroyer ) , allowing Cameron additional time to write a script for Aliens . While filming The Terminator , Cameron wrote 90 pages for Aliens , and although the script was not finished , Fox 's new president Larry Gordon was impressed and told him that if The Terminator was a success , he would be able to direct Aliens . Cameron even declared that he spent production of The Terminator thinking on which elements of that film could " make a good dry run " for the Alien sequel . 
 Following the success of The Terminator , Cameron and producing partner Gale Anne Hurd were given approval to direct and produce the sequel to Alien , scheduled for a 1986 release . Cameron was enticed by the opportunity to create a new world and opted not to follow the same formula as Alien , but to create a worthy combat sequel focusing " more on terror , less on horror " . Sigourney Weaver , who played Ripley in Alien , had doubts about the project , but after meeting Cameron she expressed interest in revisiting her character . 20th Century Fox , however , refused to sign a contract with Weaver over a payment dispute and asked Cameron to write a story excluding Ripley . He refused on the grounds that Fox had indicated that Weaver had signed on when he began writing the script . With Cameron 's persistence , Fox signed the contract and Weaver obtained a salary of $ 1 million , a sum 30 times what she was paid for the first film ( and equivalent to $ 2 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 in present @-@ day terms ) . Weaver nicknamed her role in the Alien sequel " <unk> " , referring to John Rambo of the Rambo series , and stated that she approached the role as akin to the titular role in Henry V or women warriors in Chinese classical literature . 
 Cameron drew inspiration for the Aliens story from the Vietnam War , a situation in which a technologically superior force was mired in a hostile foreign environment : " Their training and technology are inappropriate for the specifics , and that can be seen as analogous to the inability of superior American firepower to conquer the unseen enemy in Vietnam : a lot of firepower and very little wisdom , and it didn 't work . " The attitude of the space marines was influenced by the Vietnam War ; they are portrayed as cocky and confident of their inevitable victory , but when they find themselves facing a less technologically advanced but more determined enemy , the outcome is not what they expect . Cameron listed Robert A. Heinlein 's novel Starship Troopers as a major influence that led to the incorporation of various themes and phrases , such as the terms " the drop " and " bug hunt " , as well as the cargo @-@ loader exoskeleton . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Cameron opted to hire actors who had , or could imitate , American accents . After over 3 @,@ 000 individuals in the United Kingdom were unsuccessfully auditioned , American actors were chosen instead , including three who had previously worked with Cameron on The Terminator ; Lance Henriksen , Bill Paxton , and Michael Biehn . Actors who played Marines were asked to read Starship Troopers and undergo military training , which included running , lifting weights , learning salutes , marches , deployments , and maneuvers , for two weeks . Cameron wanted the Marines to train together so that they would form bonds that would show on @-@ screen . Sigourney Weaver , William Hope , and Paul Reiser were absent from training because of other obligations , but Cameron felt that this suited their characters as " outsiders " in the film . 
 Main cast : 
 Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley : 
 A former warrant officer , and the sole survivor of an Alien attack on her ship , the Nostromo . Weaver reprised her role from Alien . She received a Saturn Award for best actress for her performance and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress , her first Academy Award nomination . 
 Michael Biehn as Corporal Dwayne Hicks : 
 One of the Colonial Marines ' squad leaders ; he was hastily cast a week after filming had commenced , and thus was not present for the military training that the other actors playing marines went through James Remar was originally cast as Hicks but left the project over creative differences with Cameron . In an interview on episode # 128 of the <unk> podcast , Remar stated that he was replaced due to being fired after he was busted due to the possession of drugs . 
 Paul Reiser as Carter J. Burke : 
 A representative from the Weyland @-@ Yutani Corporation , sent to investigate LV @-@ 426 . 
 Lance Henriksen as Bishop : 
 An android serving as the executive officer aboard the Sulaco . 
 Carrie Henn as Rebecca " Newt " Jorden : 
 A young girl , who is the only survivor of the colony on LV @-@ 426 . According to the casting director , Newt was the most difficult role to cast : Schoolchildren were auditioned , but many of them had acted in commercials and were accustomed to smiling after saying their lines . Henn was chosen out of 500 children for the role , although she had no previous acting experience . She received a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor , but chose not to pursue an acting career , and became a teacher . 
 Bill Paxton as Private Hudson : 
 The Marine team 's technician . He received a Saturn Award for best supporting actor . 
 William Hope as Lieutenant Gorman 
 The Marines ' inexperienced commanding officer 
 Ricco Ross as Private Frost : 
 A member of the Colonial Marines . 
 Al Matthews as Sergeant <unk> : 
 One of the Marines ' commanding officers . Matthews attributed his casting to his military experience 
 Also featured are Jenette Goldstein as Private Vasquez ( she received a Saturn Award for best supporting actress ) , Mark Rolston as Private Drake , Colette Hiller as Corporal Ferro , Daniel Kash as Private <unk> , Cynthia Dale Scott as Corporal Dietrich , the Marines ' corpsman , Tip Tipping as Private Crowe , and Trevor Steedman as Private <unk> . Paul Maxwell portrays Van <unk> , the head of the review board that revokes Ripley 's flight license , and Carl Toop portrays the Aliens and Alien Queen . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Aliens was filmed over ten months on a budget of $ 18 million at Pinewood Studios in England . Cameron , bound by a low budget and a deadline , found it difficult to adjust to what Paxton called the " really indentured " working practices of the British crew , such as the tea breaks that brought production to a halt . The crew were admirers of Ridley Scott , and many of them believed Cameron was too young and inexperienced to direct , despite Cameron 's attempts to show them his previous film , The Terminator , which had not yet been released in the UK . They mocked producer Gale Anne Hurd , insisting that she was only receiving the producer credit because she was married to Cameron . Cameron clashed with the original director of photography , Dick Bush , when Bush started production saying the schedule couldn 't be met , and when he insisted on lighting the Alien nest set brightly ; Cameron insisted on a dark , foreboding nest , relying on the lights from the Marines ' armor . After Bush was fired , the crew walked out . Hurd managed to coax the team back to work and Adrian Biddle was hired as Bush 's replacement . 
 Some scenes of the Alien nest were shot at the decommissioned Acton Lane Power Station in Acton , London . The crew thought it was a perfect place to film because of its grilled walkways and numerous corridors , but had to spend money to remove asbestos from the station . The Atmosphere Processor set was not dismantled after filming , and was reused in 1989 as the Axis Chemicals set for Batman ( 1989 ) . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Music composer James Horner felt he was not given enough time to create a musical score . Horner arrived in England and expected the film to be " locked " so he could write the score in six weeks , which he thought was a sufficient amount of time . Horner , however , discovered that filming and editing were still taking place , and he was unable to view the film . He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor Ray Lovejoy was barely keeping up with the workload for reasons of time restrictions . Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied with sound effects , citing that Cameron spent two days with the sound engineer creating the sounds for the pulse rifles . He also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio ; the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios , a 30 @-@ year @-@ old studio that was barely able to patch in synthesizers or use the electronic equipment that Horner required . 
 Six weeks from theatrical release , no dubbing had taken place and the score had not been written , as Horner was unable to view the completed film . The final cue for the scene in which Ripley battles the Alien queen was written overnight . Cameron completely reworked the scene , leaving Horner to rewrite the music . As Gale Hurd did not have much music production experience , she and Cameron denied Horner 's request to push the film back four weeks so he could finish the score . Horner felt that , given more time , he could get the score to 100 % of his satisfaction , rather than the 80 % he estimated he had been able to achieve . The score was recorded in roughly four days . Despite his troubles , Horner received an Academy Award nomination ( his first ) for Best Original Score . 
 Horner stated that tensions between himself and Cameron were so high during post @-@ production that he assumed they would never work together again . Horner believed that Cameron 's film schedules were too short and stressful . The two parted ways until 1997 when Cameron , impressed with Horner 's score for Braveheart , asked him to compose the score for Titanic . 
 = = Design = = 
 Early concept art was created by Syd Mead , who had previously worked on Blade Runner , 2010 and Tron . One of the original designs for the spaceship Sulaco was spherical , but it was redesigned as the ship would be out of frame due to the film 's aspect ratio . Cameron showed Mead his own concept art and the final result was described as " rocket gun that carries stuff " . Concept artists were asked to incorporate subliminal acknowledgments to the Vietnam War , which included designing the dropship as a combination of a F @-@ 4 Phantom II and AH @-@ 1 Cobra . 
 British Airways was re @-@ equipping several of its aircraft tug tractors , and the crew managed to purchase a 635 hp Hunslet <unk> 77 tug to use as the armored personnel carrier . It initially weighed 70 short tons ( 64 @,@ 000 kg ) , and although the crew removed 35 short tons ( 32 @,@ 000 kg ) of lead ballast , the power station floor had to be reinforced to support the weight . The crew used many " junk " items in the set designs , such as Ripley 's toilet , which came from a Boeing 707 . Lockers , helicopter engines , and vending machines were used as set elements in the opening hypersleep scene . Production designer Peter Lamont was asked to reduce the cost of several scenes , including the not @-@ yet @-@ filmed space marine hypersleep sequence . Gale Hurd wanted to cut the scene altogether , but Lamont and Cameron felt it was important to the sequence of the film . To save on cost , only four hypersleep chambers were created and a mirror was used to create the illusion that there were twelve in the scene . Instead of using hydraulics , the chambers were opened and closed by wires operated by puppeteers . 
 Weapons used by the space marines were based on real , fully functional weapons . British armorers used guns they found to be the most reliable when firing blanks and those which looked futuristic . The ' pulse rifles ' were created from a Thompson SMG , with an attached forend of a Franchi <unk> @-@ 12 shotgun and a Remington 12 Gauge Model <unk> receiver with barrel . The ' smart guns ' carried by Vasquez and Drake were based on the German MG @-@ 42 machine gun and were maneuvered with Steadicam @-@ like harnesses created using old motorcycle parts . The crew found flamethrowers the most difficult weapon to create and use , as they were the heaviest and most dangerous . 
 Aside from the Alien Queen , designed by Cameron himself , the Aliens still took inspiration off H. R. Giger 's designs for the original . The only change was removing the translucent dome that gave the creature 's head its sleek shape in Alien , exposing the ridged , spined cranium beneath . Cameron felt the dome was too fragile for the practical effects , and also felt that the cranium design was more visually interesting without it . 
 = = = Visual effects = = = 
 Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak were hired to supervise the visual effects , having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies . Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV @-@ 426 , using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide . Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather ; the wind would blow over the props , although it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet . Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were , including rear projection , mirrors , beam splitters , camera splits and foreground miniatures . Due to budget limits , Cameron said he had to pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley 's shuttle in the opening scene . Practical effects supervisor John Richardson ( who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film ) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift Power Loader exoskeletons , which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction . The model could not stand on its own , requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane . While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model , a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs . 
 The Alien suits were made more flexible and durable than the ones used in Alien , to expand on the creatures ' movements and allow them to crawl and jump . Dancers , gymnasts , and stunt men were hired to portray the Aliens . Various 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) tall mannequins were also created to make Aliens that stood in inhuman poses , and could have their bodies exploded to simulate gunshot wounds . Stan Winston 's team created fully articulated <unk> that could move their fingers ; these were moved by wires hidden on the scenery or the actors ' clothing . The one that walked towards Ripley had a mechanism akin to a pull toy , with pulleys that moved the fingers , and its jump combined three models shot <unk> : the walking Facehugger , a stationary model dangling on a table leg , and another model being pulled towards the camera . 
 Scenes involving the Alien queen were the most difficult to film , according to production staff . A life @-@ sized mock @-@ up was created by Stan Winston 's company in the United States to see how it would operate . Once the testing was complete , the crew working on the queen flew to England and began work creating the final version . Standing at 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) tall , it was operated using a mixture of puppeteers , control rods , hydraulics , cables , and a crane above to support it . Two puppeteers were inside the suit operating its arms , and sixteen were required to move it . All sequences involving the full size queen were filmed in @-@ camera with no post @-@ production manipulation . Additionally , a miniature alien queen was used for certain shots .

 Aliens <unk> universal critical acclaim . Test and pre @-@ screenings were unable to take place for Aliens due to the film not being completed until its week of release . Once it was released in cinemas , critical reaction was generally positive to very positive . Critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3 @.@ 5 stars out of 4 and called it " painfully and unremittingly intense " and a " superb example of filmmaking craft . " He also stated " when I walked out of the theater , there were knots in my stomach from the film 's roller @-@ coaster ride of violence . " Walter Goodman of The New York Times said it was a " flaming , flashing , crashing , crackling <unk> ' em @-@ up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics . " Time magazine featured the film on the cover of its July 28 , 1986 , issue , calling it the " summer 's scariest movie " . Time reviewer Richard Schickel declared the film " a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore . " The selection of Aliens for a Time cover was attributed to the successful reception of the film , as well as its novel example of a science fiction action heroine . Echoing Time 's assessment , Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader called the film " one sequel that surpasses the original . " Gene Siskel gave the film a negative review , describing Aliens as " one extremely violent , protracted attack on the senses " and that " toward the end , the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience . Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens . Well , the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive , but I wouldn 't want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours . " 
 Reviews of the film have remained mostly positive over the years . In a 1997 interview , Weaver stated that Aliens " made the first Alien look like a cucumber sandwich . " In a 2000 review , film critic James Berardinelli said " When it comes to the logical marriage of action , adventure , and science fiction , few films are as effective or accomplished as Aliens . " Austin Chronicle contributor Marjorie Baumgarten labeled the film in 2002 as " a non @-@ stop action fest . " In 2016 , James Charisma of Playboy ranked the film number six on a list of 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals . Based on 48 reviews , the film holds a " Certified Fresh " rating of 98 % on Rotten Tomatoes with an average critic score of 8 @.@ 8 out of 10 . It also holds a score of 87 out of 100 ( " universal acclaim " ) on the other major review aggregator , Metacritic . Aliens was also featured in Empire Magazine 's 500 Greatest films of All Time poll at number 30 , and in Empire 's recent 301 Greatest Films of All Time poll at number 19 . 
 = = = Interpretation and analysis = = = 
 Philosopher Stephen Mulhall has remarked that the four Alien films represent an artistic rendering of the difficulties faced by the woman 's " voice " to have itself heard in a masculinist society , as Ripley continually encounters males who try to silence her and to force her to submit to their desires . Mulhall sees this depicted in several events in Aliens , particularly the inquest scene in which Ripley 's explanation for the deaths and destruction of the Nostromo , as well as her attempts to warn the board members of the Alien danger , are met with officious disdain . However , Mulhall believes that Ripley 's relationship with Hicks illustrates that Aliens " is devoted ... to the possibility of modes of masculinity that seek not to stifle but rather to accommodate the female voice , and modes of femininity that can acknowledge and incorporate something more or other of masculinity than our worst nightmares of it . " 
 Several movie academics , including Barbara Creed , have remarked on the color and lighting symbolism in the Alien franchise , which offsets white , strongly lit environments ( spaceships , corporate offices ) against darker , dirtier , " corrupted " settings ( derelict alien ship , abandoned industrial facilities ) . These black touches contrast or even attempt to take over the purity of the white elements . Others , such as Kile M. <unk> of Emory University , agree with this interpretation and point to the Sulaco with its " sterilized , white interior " as representing this element in the second film of the franchise . 
 While some claim that the shape of the Sulaco was based on a submarine , the design has most often been described as a " gun in space " resembling the rifles used in the movie . Author Roz Kaveney called the opening shot of the ship traveling through space " fetishistic " and " shark @-@ like " , " an image of brutal strength and ingenious efficiency " — while the militarized interior of the Sulaco ( designed by Ron Cobb ) is contrasted to the organic interior of the Nostromo in the first movie ( also designed by Cobb ) . David McIntee noted the homage the scene pays to the opening tour through the Nostromo in Alien . 
 The android character Bishop has been the subject of literary and philosophical analysis as a high @-@ profile fictional android conforming to science fiction author Isaac Asimov 's Three Laws of Robotics and as a model of a compliant , potentially self @-@ aware machine . His portrayal has been studied by writers for the University of Texas Press for its implications relating to how humans deal with the presence of an " Other " , as Ripley treats them with fear and suspicion after the android Ash tried to kill her in the original Alien movie , and a form of " hi @-@ tech racism and android apartheid " is present throughout the series . This is seen as part of a larger trend of <unk> in films prior to the 1990s , with Bishop 's role being particularly significant as he proves his worth at the end of the film , thus confounding Ripley 's expectations .

 Aliens was first released on VHS in 1987 , finishing as the tenth best @-@ selling title of the year . A " Special Edition " of Aliens was released in 1992 on laserdisc and VHS that restored seventeen minutes of deleted footage . These additions include a segment showing Newt 's family first encountering the derelict spacecraft on LV @-@ 426 , Ripley learning that her daughter died during the years she was in hypersleep , a scene in the operations building in which the Marines use sentry guns against the Aliens , and several extended dialogue scenes between Ripley and the Marines . These scenes had been deleted from the original theatrical release as 20th Century Fox representatives thought the film was showing " too much nothing " and spent an unnecessary amount of time building suspense . 
 Most of the Special Edition 's footage was first seen when the film made its broadcast television debut on CBS in 1989 , but two additional sequences concerning Burke 's transmission to the colony about the derelict , and the Jorden family 's subsequent discovery of the same , were added to the initial Laserdisc release . According to Cameron , the visual effects for the scene were incomplete , so he went back to the Skotak brothers and had them finish the sequences . All currently available versions of the Special Edition contain these scenes . 
 The special edition was released as part of The Alien Legacy 20th Anniversary Edition DVD box set in 1999 along with Alien , Alien 3 , and Alien : Resurrection . Both the theatrical version and the special edition were released again in 2003 as part of the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set along with similar versions of Alien , Alien 3 , and Alien : Resurrection . A separate two @-@ disc " Special Collector 's Edition " DVD of Aliens was released on January 6 , 2004 , containing the same material as the two Aliens discs in the Quadrilogy set . Additional content in these versions included an audio commentary for the special edition featuring director James Cameron , producer Gale Hurd , special effects artists and crew members . The second disc included special features relating to pre @-@ production , production , and post @-@ production .

 = Juno Beach = 
 Juno or Juno Beach was one of five beaches of the Allied invasion of German occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 , during the Second World War . The beach spanned from Courseulles , a village just east of the British beach Gold , to Saint @-@ Aubin @-@ sur @-@ Mer , just west of the British beach Sword . Taking Juno was the responsibility of the Canadian Army , with sea transport , mine sweeping , and a naval bombardment force provided by the Royal Canadian Navy and the British Royal Navy as well as elements from the Free French , Norwegian , and other Allied navies . The objectives of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division on D @-@ Day were to cut the Caen @-@ Bayeux road , seize the Carpiquet airport west of Caen , and form a link between the two British beaches of Gold and Sword on either side of Juno Beach . 
 The beach was defended by two battalions of the German 716th Infantry Division , with elements of the 21st Panzer Division held in reserve near Caen . 
 The invasion plan called for two brigades of the 3rd Canadian Division to land on two beach sectors — Mike and Nan — focusing on Courseulles , Bernières and Saint @-@ Aubin . It was hoped that the preliminary naval and air bombardments would soften up the beach defences and destroy coastal strong points . Close support on the beaches was to be provided by amphibious tanks of the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade . Once the landing zones were secured , the plan called for the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade to land reserve battalions and deploy inland , the Royal Marine commandos to establish contact with the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword Beach and the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade to link up with the British 50th Infantry Division on Gold Beach . The 3rd Canadian Division 's D @-@ Day objectives were to capture Carpiquet Airfield and reach the Caen – Bayeux railway line by nightfall . 
 The landings initially encountered heavy resistance from the German 716th Division ; the preliminary bombardment proved less effective than had been hoped , and rough weather forced the first wave to be delayed until 07 : 35 . Several assault companies — notably those of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles and The Queen 's Own Rifles of Canada — took heavy casualties in the opening minutes of the first wave . Strength of numbers , as well as coordinated fire support from artillery and armoured squadrons , cleared most of the coastal defences within two hours of landing . The reserves of the 7th and 8th brigades began deploying at 08 : 30 ( along with the Royal Marines ) , while the 9th Brigade began its deployment at 11 : 40 . 
 The subsequent push inland towards Carpiquet and the Caen – Bayeux railway line achieved mixed results . The sheer numbers of men and vehicles on the beaches created lengthy delays between the landing of the 9th Brigade and the beginning of substantive attacks to the south . The 7th Brigade encountered heavy initial opposition before pushing south and making contact with the British 50th Division at Creully . The 8th Brigade encountered heavy resistance from a battalion of the 716th at Tailleville , while the 9th Brigade deployed towards Carpiquet early in the evening . Resistance in Saint @-@ Aubin prevented the Royal Marines from establishing contact with the British 3rd Division on Sword . When all operations on the Anglo @-@ Canadian front were ordered to halt at 21 : 00 , by which time The Queen 's Own Rifles of Canada had reached its D @-@ Day objective , and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had succeeded in pushing farther inland than any other landing force on D @-@ Day .

 In 1942 , the Western Allies agreed to open a second front ( the Western Front ) in Western Europe to take pressure off the beleaguered Red Army in the Soviet Union . While Britain and the United States did not yet possess the resources to mount a full invasion , invasion plans that came to be known as Operation Sledgehammer were drawn up , in case the German position in Western Europe weakened or the USSR 's situation became dire . In August 1942 Anglo @-@ Canadian forces attempted an abortive landing — Operation Jubilee — at the French port of Dieppe ; the landing was designed to test the feasibility of a cross @-@ channel invasion . The attack was poorly planned and ended in disaster ; 4 @,@ 963 soldiers were killed , wounded or captured . Following the Anglo @-@ American victory against Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in North Africa in May 1943 , British , American and Canadian troops invaded Sicily in July 1943 , followed by Italy in September . By December the Allies ' progress had slowed facing tenacious German resistance and the difficult geography of the Italian Peninsula . 
 After gaining valuable experience in amphibious assaults and inland fighting , Allied planners returned to the plans to invade Northern France , now postponed to 1944 . Under the direction of General Dwight D. Eisenhower ( Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force ) and Frederick Morgan , plans for the invasion of France coalesced as Operation Overlord . With an initial target date of 1 May 1944 , the infantry attack was conceived as a joint assault by five divisions transported by landing craft , constituting the largest amphibious operation in military history . The attack was later scheduled for Monday , 5 June 1944 , and Normandy was selected for the landing sites , with a zone of operations extending from the Cotentin Peninsula to Caen . There were originally seventeen sectors along the Normandy coastline with codenames taken from one of the spelling alphabets of the time , from Able , west of Omaha , to Rodger on the east flank of the invasion area . Eight further sectors were added when the planned invasion was extended to include Utah on the Cotentin Peninsula . Sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green , Red and White . Operation Overlord called for the British Second Army to assault between the River Orne and Port en Bessin , capture Caen , and form a front line from Caumont @-@ l 'Éventé to the south @-@ east of Caen , to acquire airfields and protect the left flank of the United States First Army while it captured Cherbourg . Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the city of Falaise , which could then be used as a pivot for a swing left to advance on Argentan , the Touques River and then towards the River Seine . 
 After delays due to both logistical difficulties and poor weather , the D @-@ Day of Overlord , the largest amphibious operation ever , was postponed 24 hours to 6 June 1944 . Eisenhower and Montgomery , commander of 21st Army Group , aimed to capture Caen within the first day , and liberate Paris within 90 days . 
 = = = Juno = = = 
 Operation Neptune , the landing phase of Overlord , called for a five @-@ division front spread across 50 miles ( 80 km ) of coastline ; three airborne divisions ( two American , one British , which also included a Canadian battalion ) would also land in the pre @-@ dawn hours of D @-@ Day . Eisenhower and General Bernard Montgomery hoped to have eight infantry divisions and fourteen tank regiments in the Normandy beachhead by nightfall on D @-@ Day . The landing zone was divided into five landing areas , with the Americans attacking Utah ( the westernmost ) and Omaha , and the British attacking Gold and Sword . Juno , a 6 @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) stretch of shoreline between La Rivière to the west and Saint @-@ Aubin to the east , was assigned to the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division ( 3rd CID ) , commanded by Major @-@ General Rodney Keller . Juno included the villages of Courseulles and Bernières . 
 The name " Juno " arose because Winston Churchill considered that the original code name — Jelly — sounded inappropriate . The code names for the beaches to be taken by British and Commonwealth forces were named after types of fish : Goldfish , Swordfish and Jellyfish , abbreviated to Gold , Sword and Jelly . Churchill " disapproved of the name Jelly for a beach on which so many men might die " . He insisted on a change to the more dignified name Juno .

 While the German army had seen its strength and morale heavily depleted by campaigns in Russia , North Africa and Italy , it remained a powerful fighting force . Despite this , most of the German divisions along the French coast in late 1943 were composed of either new recruits or veteran units resting and rebuilding from the Eastern Front ; altogether some 856 @,@ 000 soldiers were stationed in France , predominantly on the coast . An additional 60 @,@ 000 <unk> ( " voluntary helpers " ) , USSR and Polish members of the German army , served on the French coast . Under the command of Field Marshals Erwin Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt , the defences of the Atlantic Wall — a line of coastal gun emplacements , machine @-@ gun nests , minefields and beach obstacles along the French coast — were increased ; in the first six months of 1944 , the Germans laid 1 @.@ 2 million tons of steel and 17 @.@ 3 million cubic yards of concrete . Rommel also surrounded the coast with four million antitank and antipersonnel mines and 500 @,@ 000 beach obstacles . 
 On Juno , the defences of the Atlantic Wall were greater than at many other landing sectors . The Germans assumed that the Allies would land during high tide , to minimize the distance during which they would be exposed on the beaches and created " a ' devil 's garden ' of beach obstacles ... deployed in rows between 12 – 17 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 2 m ) above the low @-@ tide mark " . <unk> of machine @-@ gun positions , antitank and antipersonnel artillery and bunkers were located every 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) , manned by several platoons with mortars . Minefields were deployed surrounding these strongpoints , and additional defences were present in the Courseulles harbour . 
 The Calvados beaches of Normandy were defended by the 716th Static and 352nd Infantry divisions , with the Canadian landing zone defended by elements of the 716th . It was formed mostly from soldiers under 18 or over 35 , comprising 7 @,@ 771 combat troops in six battalions ( as opposed to 9 or 12 battalions of Allied divisions ) . While the 352nd was considered a first @-@ rate division , the 716th was " accounted a better @-@ than @-@ average static division " ; these divisions generally had very few vehicles or tanks and had to rely on infantry and field regiments . On Juno the division 's 736th Grenadier Regiment deployed four infantry companies : 7 Kompanie held what was to become " Mike Sector " , the 6th was stationed in Courseulles , the 5th was at Bernières , and the 9th held Nan sector and Saint @-@ Aubin . A second line of four infantry companies and one panzer company was stationed 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) inland . The 21st Panzer Division was deployed south @-@ east of Caen and two battalions of Polish and Russian conscripts were stationed on the flanks of Juno adjacent to Sword and Gold . 
 = = = Canadian preparations = = = 
 Canadian training for D @-@ Day had begun as early as July 1943 , when Lieutenant @-@ General Andrew McNaughton of the First Canadian Army informed Harry Crerar , commander of II Canadian Corps , that the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division might play a role in the invasion of France . Initial training was demanding , and complicated by the lack of any landing craft to practice with , either LCAs or LCTs . Field exercises in Scotland commenced in August and September 1943 , and succeeded in establishing unique techniques and equipment for use by armoured and artillery regiments in storming the beach ; the most significant were the amphibious duplex drive tanks ( DD tanks ) . Mechanisms were also developed to allow artillery to bombard the beach while still attached to their landing craft . Through the winter of 1943 , units jointly developed more advanced assault tactics among the Juno regiments . 
 The landings would be supported by the largest invasion fleet in history — 7 @,@ 016 vessels in total . The Royal Canadian Navy contributed 121 vessels to the armada , including destroyers , frigates , corvettes , landing ships , minesweepers and torpedo boats . Four Canadian Tribal @-@ class destroyers were in the Royal Navy 's 10th Destroyer Flotilla , which joined other RN units in keeping the English Channel near Normandy clear of German naval units . Naval Force J had begun intense training for the invasion with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division in February 1944 , with a full @-@ scale simulation of the invasion carried out on 4 May in Exercise Fabius . On D @-@ Day itself , Force J , commanded from HMS Hilary , was to bombard German defensive positions along the landing zone with everything from heavy @-@ calibre cruiser guns to self @-@ propelled artillery attached to landing craft . According to Canadian Army Historian C. P. Stacey , a light bombardment of the landing zone would commence " 30 minutes before H Hour and continue for 15 minutes ; heavy bombing would then begin on the flanks of the divisional attack , lasting until H Hour " . Additional cover would be provided by Royal and Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons both before and on D @-@ Day . A successful surprise invasion required total air superiority over the English Channel and Normandy . In the months preceding D @-@ Day , the RAF Second Tactical Air Force attacked airfields , coastal garrisons , radar , railway lines and transport routes in order to soften the beach defences , as well as prevent the German Luftwaffe from mounting a serious challenge to air superiority over Normandy . By dawn , on 6 June , the RAF tactical air forces had 2 @,@ 434 fighter and fighter @-@ bomber aircraft with approximately 700 light and medium bombers to support them . 
 The operational plan for Juno was divided into two main sectors : Mike ( west ) and Nan ( east ) . Mike Sector would be attacked by the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade , with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles , The Canadian Scottish Regiment and the 1st Hussars in support . The 7th Brigade was to take Courseulles and drive inland . Nan Sector would be assaulted by the Regina Rifle Regiment of 7th Brigade , as well as the North Shore Regiment and the Queen 's Own Rifles of Canada of the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade , while tanks of the Fort Garry Horse provided armoured support ; a squadron of specialized AVRE engineering tanks from the British 79th Armoured Division would land on each beach sector as well . The 8th Brigade was to capture Bernières and the western edge of Saint @-@ Aubin , then push south into Normandy . The operational plan also called for the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade and the Sherbrooke Fusiliers to be deployed to Juno as reinforcements within 4 to 6 hours of the initial assault . By nightfall of D @-@ Day , the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division was slated to have captured the high ground west of Caen , the Bayeux – Caen railway line , and the seaside towns of Courseulles , Bernières , Saint @-@ Aubin and Bény @-@ sur @-@ Mer .

 Air attacks on Normandy 's coastal defences began in earnest on 5 June at 23 : 30 , with RAF Bomber Command units targeting the primary coastal defences . The attack continued until 05 : 15 , with 5 @,@ 268 tons of bombs dropped by 1 @,@ 136 sorties ; this marked the largest attack by Bomber Command in terms of tonnage up to that point in the war . Initial attacks on the Atlantic Wall proved ineffective , with poor weather and visibility making it difficult to accurately hit the bunkers and turrets . The bombing left the defences on Omaha , Gold and Juno virtually intact , yet did not damage Allied landing craft in the Channel ( as many planners had feared it would ) . 230 Royal Canadian Air Force bombers specifically bombed targets on Juno during this raid , yet direct damage was limited . 
 As the Americans began their own bombing runs against Omaha and Utah to the west , the Anglo @-@ Canadian naval forces began their counter @-@ battery fire , seeking to knock out German shore batteries and bunkers . The British had attached the cruisers HMS Belfast and Diadem to Force J to serve as heavy support . Belfast commenced bombardment of the Atlantic Wall at 05 : 30 and Diadem at 05 : 52 on 6 June . The naval gunfire proved more effective than the aerial bombardment ; the battery at Longues was the only one to return fire , and was quickly destroyed by the light cruiser HMS Ajax . Indeed , most of the gun batteries at Juno were incomplete on D @-@ Day , and did not possess sufficient protection or communication measures to accurately return fire on Force J. The Bény @-@ sur @-@ Mer battery was neutralized by Diadem shortly after she opened fire . 
 At 06 : 10 , the 11 destroyers of Force J moved shoreward to begin bombardment , hoping to damage light gun emplacements and prevent the German 716th from mobilizing and moving across the beach . They were supplemented by additional raids by medium bombers and fighter @-@ bombers of the RAF and USAAF , which dropped an additional 2 @,@ 796 tons of ordnance on the five landing zones . While the medium bombers proved inaccurate , the Hawker Typhoon fighter @-@ bombers proved more effective at attacking coastal defences . As the bombing runs continued to hit Juno with ordnance , the destroyers and landing craft moved towards the beach and began close @-@ range saturation bombardment . In addition to the destroyers of Force J — two Canadian , eight British , one French — bombardment was also provided by converted LCTs fitted with 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) guns . Smaller , light @-@ gunned landing craft were able to get closer to the beach and use their 6 @-@ pounder guns against German defensive positions . Additional firepower was provided by eight landing craft fitted with over 1 @,@ 000 high @-@ explosive rockets and 24 LCTs , each carrying four M7 Priest self @-@ propelled guns . These field regiments , while still seaborne , were to fire heavy concentrations of high explosive and smoke shells against the four main " resistance nests " in " Mike " and " Nan " sectors , beginning half an hour before H Hour . Forward observation and fire control officers in the leading assault waves were to make the necessary adjustments to this neutralizing fire during the assault . 
 The bombardment was scheduled to cease immediately before the assault companies deployed on Juno , but due to heavy seas , the landing was delayed by ten minutes , to 07 : 45 in Mike sector and 07 : 55 in Nan Sector . This was at a slightly higher tide , closer to the beach obstacles and mines . The LCTs carrying the field artillery were forced to adjust course to avoid landing too early ; the LCTs carrying DD tanks were forced to break off their advance . The seas proved too rough to launch the DD tanks , so they were ordered to deploy from the LCTs several hundred yards out from the beach . 
 = = = Landing : 7th Brigade ( Mike , Nan Green ) = = = 
 Though the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade was scheduled to land on Mike Sector at 07 : 35 , rough seas and poor craft coordination pushed this time back by ten minutes . Two assault companies of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles , one assault company of the Canadian Scottish Regiment , and one squadron of the 1st Hussars were to land on " Mike Red " and also on " Mike Green " , while the Regina Rifle Regiment , supported by a second squadron of the 1st Hussars , landed on " Nan Green " sector . The first Winnipegs touched down at 07 : 49 , with the remaining assault companies deploying within seven minutes . The LCAs carrying " B " Company craft were engaged while about 700 yards from shore . Disembarkation had to be done under direct fire and , in consequence , heavy casualties were sustained by this company while landing . The strongpoint in this area consisted of three casemates and twelve machine @-@ gun emplacements . This left the infantry the grim prospect of clearing it by direct assault . " B " company was unable to advance further without armoured support . The Hussars ' " A " Squadron launched 1 @,@ 500 yards ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) from the beach , but would not be fully deployed until a full six minutes after the Winnipegs were ashore . To their west , " D " Company faced less defensive fire , as it was clear of the strongpoint . The company easily cleared the beach , and went through the barbed wire with light casualties . " A " platoon of the 6th Field Company Royal Canadian Engineers was redirected to clear the minefields facing " D " Company , given that the flail tanks had yet to land . On the far right , " C " Company of the Canadian Scottish Regiment landed with little opposition , and discovered that their objective — a 75 mm gun emplacement — had been destroyed by naval gunfire . 
 To the east of Mike Sector , the Regina Rifles came ashore on " Nan Green " with the objective of subduing German forces in Courseulles . " A " Company reported touchdown at 08 : 09 , and met heavy resistance almost immediately ; " B " Company reported touchdown at 08 : 15 . The Hussars ' tanks first reported deploying twenty minutes before the infantry , with " B " Squadron HQ reporting their landing at 07 : 58 . They faced the task of destroying a heavy gun emplacement equipped with 88 mm and 75 mm guns , and 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) thick concrete walls . The pre @-@ landing bombardment had failed to destroy the emplacement , and heavy machine guns subsequently inflicted high casualty rates on the company ; one LCA reported six men killed within seconds of lowering the ramps . One platoon was able to breach the barbed wire lining the beach and take cover in Courseulles , and then eliminated the machine @-@ gun positions engaging " A " Company of the Regina Rifles . The DD tanks arrived in the Regina Rifles sector with both greater numbers and punctuality than in the Winnipegs ' sector . The 75 mm gun emplacement in the Courseulles strongpoint was destroyed by fire from " B " Squadron of the 1st Hussars ; the 88 mm was similarly silenced . To their east , " B " Company encountered limited resistance , and succeeded in pushing into Courseulles , and soon " had cleared a succession of the assigned blocks in the village " , according to Stacey . 
 With the initial assault companies ashore and fighting for their objectives , the reserve companies and battalion ( Canadian Scottish Regiment ) began their deployment on Juno . " A " and " C " Companies of the Winnipeg Rifles landed at 08 : 05 , and began to push towards the villages of Banville and Sainte @-@ Croix @-@ sur @-@ Mer . " A " Company encountered heavy machine @-@ gun resistance , and had to request support from the 1st Hussars to clear the position . On Nan Green , " C " and " D " Companies of the Regina Rifles prepared to storm Courseulles . " C " Company touched down at 08 : 35 , and moved into the village without difficulty . " D " Company was further delayed , meaning that several LCAs struck antitank mines attached to beach obstacles ; only 49 " D " Company soldiers reached the beach . The Canadian Scottish Regiment arrived on the beach at 08 : 30 , with the leading companies coming under heavy mortar fire ; it took the regiment a full hour to get off the beaches and push further inland . 
 = = = Landing : 8th Brigade ( Nan White , Red ) = = = 
 Originally scheduled to land at 07 : 45 to the east of the 7th , the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade 's two assault battalions were postponed by 10 minutes as a result of heavy seas . The Queen 's Own Rifles of Canada ( QOR ) landed at 08 : 12 at Nan White and faced the most tenacious defences of any unit in Nan Sector : an 88 mm gun emplacement with multiple machine @-@ gun nests outside of Bernières . The first LCA to touch down saw 10 of its first 11 soldiers either killed or wounded . " B " Company came ashore directly in front of the main resistance nests , 200 yards east of their intended landing zone , subjecting them to heavy mortar and machine @-@ gun fire . The QOR had been scheduled to advance with DD fire support , but the heavy seas meant that " instead of swimming in , they [ DD tanks ] left their craft close inshore and landed behind the infantry assault companies " . Several soldiers from " B " Company succeeded in outflanking the main pillbox and killing its gunners with grenades and small arms . One LCA 's rudder from " B " Company had jammed , and that platoon landed far to the left of the rest of " B " Company , enabling them to outflank and destroy the gun emplacements . With the defences silenced , the QOR was able to advance into Bernières , having taken 65 casualties on the beaches . To their west , " A " Company encountered less resistance , but was limited by poorly coordinated run @-@ ins by the LCAs to the beach . " A " Company was able to quickly reach the seawall and breach the barbed wire , but encountered heavy mortar and sniper resistance in Bernières . This was the only sector of Juno where armoured support proved ineffective , as " B " Squadron of the Fort Garry Horse was too far out from the beach to provide heavy support . 
 The first units of the North Shore Regiment 's " A " and " B " companies touched down on Nan Red at 08 : 10 in chest @-@ deep water . They were tasked with securing Saint @-@ Aubin and clearing defences in the village . " B " Company landed to find that the Saint @-@ Aubin strong point " appeared not to have been touched " by preliminary naval bombardment . The two assault companies faced a 100 @-@ yard ( 91 m ) sprint across open beach in the face of fire from Saint @-@ Aubin . " A " Company suffered the heaviest casualties , incurring many fatalities from beach mines . " B " Company faced stronger opposition at the strong point , yet managed to breach the seawall and barbed wire . The strong point 's 50 mm antitank gun was still active , and the thick concrete casemates protected it from infantry fire . By 08 : 10 , Sherman tanks of the Fort Garry Horse and Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers ( AVRE ) tanks of the 80th Assault Squadron , Royal Engineers , had landed at Nan Red , and began to assist " B " Company in clearing the gun emplacement . The 50 mm gun knocked out four of the squadron 's tanks , while the North Shore 's machine @-@ gun platoon flanked the position . The right section of the strong point was eliminated by antitank guns and combat engineers , while the central antitank gun was silenced by petard shells from the British AVREs . When the North Shore captured the strong point , approximately half the defenders were killed ; 48 German soldiers surrendered . 
 The 8th Brigade 's reserve battalion , Le Régiment de la Chaudière , began deploying to the beaches at 08 : 30 along with the reserve companies of the North Shore and QOR . More than half of the LCAs were crippled by mines buried along the beach ; QOR " C " Company was forced to touch down further offshore when their LCAs were damaged by mines . " C " Company linked up with " B " Squadron of the Fort Garry Horse , and moved to assist the pinned @-@ down and exhausted " A " Company . The North Shore 's C and D Companies landed outside of Saint @-@ Aubin , with " C " Company taking over for " A " Company in the advance further into Saint @-@ Aubin , while " D " Company established a firm presence inside the village . All but one of the LCAs carrying Chaudière " A " Company foundered before they could touch down on the beach , and they lost most of their equipment while swimming to shore . The Chaudières quickly formed up outside Bernières and Saint @-@ Aubin , linking up with both the QOR and the North Shores . The reserve also included the No. 48 ( Royal Marine ) Commando , which was scheduled to land 45 minutes after the first arrivals . The Commandos were to pass Saint @-@ Aubin 's eastern edge and occupy <unk> @-@ sur @-@ Mer on the eastern end of Juno . The strong point facing them had not been cleared , and 40 per cent of the 400 @-@ man unit became casualties within seconds of landing . 
 = = = Deploying reinforcements = = = 
 With Juno itself largely secured , Keller prepared to deploy the reserves of the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade and tanks of the Sherbrooke Fusiliers . The reports coming in from the battalions already on Juno were mixed ; Canadian military historian Terry Copp says that the North Shore was " proceeding according to plan " , while the Chaudières were " making progress slowly " . The two self @-@ propelled artillery regiments — the 14th Field and 19th Army Field Regiments , Royal Canadian Artillery — had deployed at 09 : 25 and 09 : 10 , and had several dozen guns in action before 11 : 00 . Opposition and continued problems with mine obstacles on Nan Red meant that the entire 9th Brigade would have to land in Bernières and Nan White sector . When the 9th Brigade 's LCIs touched down at 11 : 40 , the congestion on the beach in Nan White was so heavy that most infantry companies could not disembark from their landing craft . The 9th Brigade 's reserves consisted of the Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa , the North Nova Scotia Highlanders , the Stormont , Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders , and the Highland Light Infantry of Canada . The Glengarry Highlanders reported coming under mortar fire from German positions further inland , as " with little room to manoeuvre on dry land , the entire 9th Brigade became easy targets for German artillery " . The 9th Brigade quickly made it across the beach , and joined the Chaudières , Queen 's Own Rifles and Fort Garry Horse in Bernières to await further advance inland . 
 Having subdued German defences on the beach , the other priority of the landed forces was to clear Juno of obstacles , debris and undetonated mines , as well as establish the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division 's headquarters in Bernières . Movement Control Units came ashore just before noon , with military policemen beginning to marshal vehicles through to Bernières and Courseulles . Sappers of 619 Independent Field Company also moved in to begin clearing the minefields surrounding the beach , so as to free up the advance south towards Carpiquet . Keller himself established divisional headquarters in Bernières shortly after noon .

 At 14 : 35 , Keller met with the commanders of the 8th and 9th Infantry Brigades , as well as the newly reconstituted 2nd Armoured Brigade ( Fort Garry Horse , Sherbrooke Fusiliers , 1st Hussars ) . With the first line of objectives ( codenamed Yew ) secured on the beachhead , Keller ordered the 7th and 8th Brigades to advance with armoured support towards the second line of objectives ( Elm ) , whereupon 9th Brigade would then leapfrog over the 7th and 8th to reach the third objective line ( Oak ) . Facing them were the remains of three battalions of the 736th Grenadier Regiment , and three battalions of the 726th Regiment . " B " Company of the Winnipegs was still facing heavy resistance from snipers and machine guns in Courseulles , while the eastern companies of the North Shore Regiment were fighting for Saint @-@ Aubin . " A " and " C " Companies of the Royal Winnipegs moved off the beach , cut through the walls of barbed wire behind the German bunkers , pushed through Vaux and Graye @-@ sur @-@ Mer , and began to advance towards St. Croix and Banville . " C " Company advanced on Banville — the headquarters of II Battalion of the 726th — but was stopped by three machine @-@ gun emplacements just short of the town . Winnipeg " A " Company joined " C " Company of the Canadian Scottish Regiment and a troop of " C " Squadron of the 1st Hussars and advanced on St. Croix , unaware of a large German counter @-@ attack massing in St. Croix under the command of 8 Battalion , 726 Regiment . " C " Company of the Canadian Scottish Regiment had deployed to their west , and was able to spot the units of the 8th Battalion , and halt the counter @-@ attack before it fully materialized . " D " Company of the Winnipegs joined the advance on Banville with covering fire from the Cameron Highlanders and the 12th and 13th Field Artillery Regiments ; Banville was declared captured at 13 : 10 , although small pockets of resistance would survive until nightfall and then retreat . " D " Company of the Canadian Scottish moved to capture two bridges on the Seulles River further inland from the Winnipeg companies . " B " Company joined them , and pushed through the gap between St. Croix and Banville , joining " C " Company as it did so . " C " Squadron of the 1st Hussars provided armoured support . To their east , the Regina Rifles advanced south towards <unk> , engaging troops of the 7th Battalion of the 736th Grenadier Regiment . They reported reaching the town by 12 : 15 with two companies , and began consolidating their position in preparation for further advance . 
 In Nan Sector , the 8th Brigade 's advance started slower than that of the 7th Brigade , because the Chaudières had lost most of their equipment on the advance over the beaches . The Queen 's Own Rifles ' " C " Company was pinned down at the edge of Bernières by sniper @-@ fire , and could not cross the open fields behind the town ; their armoured support was also stopped by heavy antitank fire coming from Beny @-@ sur @-@ Mer . The Chaudières " A " and " B " Companies were caught in the crossfire ; " B " Company lost almost an entire platoon when a German 88 mm scored a direct hit on a Priest self @-@ propelled gun . Chaudière and QOR progress was slow ; all told , it took nearly two hours for artillery and heavy guns to clear the defences at Beny @-@ sur @-@ Mer , allowing the QOR to advance towards the town . Beny @-@ sur @-@ Mer was reported cleared at 14 : 00 , at which point the Chaudières began to mass in the town for a further advance south towards Carpiquet . The QOR broke off to the left to engage heavy artillery batteries to the west of Beny , and " B " Company was assisted by the guns of HMCS Algonquin , which destroyed a bunker of 105 mm guns . To their east , " C " and " D " Company of the North Shores advanced towards Tailleville — the headquarters of II Battalion of the 736th Grenadiers . Mortar fire north of the headquarters was both concentrated and accurate , slowing the advance of " C " Company . They were supported in their drive south by tanks of the Fort Garry Horse , which caught close to 100 German defenders in open fields . The North Shores and their armour support entered Tailleville at 14 : 00 , at which point the six tanks of " C " Squadron moved through the village , destroying German gun emplacements . However , the defenders of the II Battalion had created a complex underground bunker system in the village , which enabled them to continuously outflank Canadian infantry ; it would take another seven hours to clear Tailleville of defenders , which ensured that the North Shores would be unable to capture German radar sites to the south on D @-@ Day . 
 Meanwhile , " B " Company of the North Shore Regiment and No. 48 Commando of the Royal Marines were engaged in a protracted fight to secure Saint @-@ Aubin and Lagrune @-@ sur @-@ Mer . " B " Company had generally neutralized the strongpoint at <unk> within two hours of landing , which allowed Troops A and B of the Royal Marines to push west . These units had the important objective of bridging the 5 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) gap between the landing zones at Juno and Sword , which would allow for a continuous Anglo @-@ Canadian front by the end of the first day . The Royal Marines began to advance on Lagrune and strong @-@ point <unk> , while to their east No. 41 Commando Royal Marines advanced from Sword . The strongpoint was defended by " a reinforced platoon from the 736th Grenadiers " , and was centred on a group of fortified houses and 50 mm antitank guns . B Troop 's first attempt to capture it failed , and the assault was renewed with support from Centaur tanks only to again falter in the face of heavy resistance . No. 48 Commando was forced to call the assault off at nightfall , as reports of massing counter @-@ attacks by the 21st Panzer Division against the divide between Sword and Juno began to filter in . The strong points at Lagrune and Luc @-@ sur @-@ Mer were captured on 8 June . 
 = = = Drive to Elm = = = 
 The division 's advance south of Tailleville had halted , preventing an attack on German radar stations . The Queen 's Own Rifles and " C " Company of the Chaudières opted to continue their advance towards Anguerny and <unk> @-@ sur @-@ Thaon and Objective Line " Elm " . The beachhead was now filled to capacity with troops , to the point that " B " Company of the Chaudières could not be deployed alongside " C " Company without severely hindering the advance of the QOR to their east . " C " Company 's advance on Basly was even further hindered by the proximity of the combat ; the fighting occurred at such close range that the 14th Field Artillery would not provide fire support for fear of friendly @-@ fire casualties . When " C " Company reached Basly , the North Nova Scotia Highlanders formed up outside Beny @-@ sur @-@ Mer , with the intention of overtaking the Chaudières and making for Carpiquet and the Caen – Bayeux highway . At 16 : 45 , the North Novas assembled in Beny , and were the target of concentrated German mortar fire as the Sherbrooke Fusiliers de @-@ waterproofed their tanks . Three companies of the North Novas and a squadron of the <unk> advanced on the mortar positions , taking heavy casualties among the infantry but clearing the positions . The QOR entered Anguerny — on the Elm Objective Line — at 17 : 30 , and sent " D " Company to probe German defences on the hills overlooking the village . The Chaudières reported that Basly was cleared of defenders at 18 : 15 , allowing the 9th Brigade to advance towards Carpiquet Airfield . By 19 : 00 , the North Nova Scotia Highlanders were advancing towards Carpiquet , encountering their first resistance an hour later . With reports of the 21st Panzer Division attacking the flanks of the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword , Lieutenant @-@ General Miles Dempsey — commander of the British Second Army — ordered forces on Sword , Juno and Gold to establish defensive positions at their intermediate objectives . 
 On the western edge of the Canadian sector , the advance of the 7th Brigade had stalled in the face of stiffening resistance in St. Croix and Banville , throwing the right flank of the assault off @-@ schedule . The German defenders gave ground slowly , and did not begin withdrawing from the towns until the Bren Gun platoons began to arrive at 14 : 00 . Once St. Croix and Banville were cleared , the Canadian Scots pushed south to <unk> , reinforced the platoons that had captured the bridge across the Seulles earlier in the day , and moved towards the Creully – Caen road . The Canadian Scots reported reaching the road at 16 : 30 , and continued to push south past Objective Line Elm . To their west the Royal Winnipegs stopped at Elm Line , and began to erect defensive positions with Bren Gun carriers and artillery . The Regina Rifles , meanwhile , had been slow to advance from Courseulles on account of the heavy casualties taken securing the village ; the 1st Hussars ' " B " Squadron was in a similar position , with only half its fighting strength having made it off the beach . By 18 : 00 the <unk> were advancing , while the Hussars scouted ahead of the infantry companies . As the <unk> linked up with the Canadian Scots , the order to hold positions and dig in arrived from Keller 's headquarters ; the two battalions halted at 21 : 00 . 
 Three tanks of the 1st Hussars ' " C " Squadron ( No. 2 Troop ) had continued to advance southwards , pushing through side @-@ roads towards Carpiquet Airfield . Aside from a German staff @-@ car and a machine @-@ gun nest , the three Sherman tanks encountered virtually no resistance , advancing all the way to the Caen – Bayeux railway line and becoming the only unit on the whole of D @-@ Day to reach its final objective . Though the commander of the unit — Lieutenant William F. McCormick — attempted to contact his superiors to bring up reinforcements to attack Carpiquet Airfield , the three tanks eventually withdrew back to the Canadian lines . 
 = = = Positions at nightfall = = = 
 At the end of D @-@ Day , the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division was situated firmly on Objective Line Elm , short of their final D @-@ Day objectives . In the west , the 7th Brigade was anchored in Creully and Fresne @-@ <unk> . The 9th Brigade was positioned a mere 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from Caen , the farthest inland of any Allied units on D @-@ Day . On the eastern edge of the Canadian sector the 8th Brigade had taken up positions in Anguerny and <unk> , having begun in the late afternoon to dig in . The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had succeeded in advancing farther than any other divisional element in the Allied Expeditionary Force , but due to heavy fighting in Lagrune and Saint @-@ Aubin had failed to link up with the British 3rd Division from Sword . The German 716th Infantry Division was scattered and heavily depleted : division commander Lieutenant General Wilhelm Richter recorded that less than one full battalion could be mustered for further defence . The German 21st Panzer Division had driven a wedge between the British and Canadian 3rd Divisions , yet had been unable to dislodge either from the beaches . To the south , Hitler had released the elite Panzer Lehr Division and the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend ( Hitler Youth ) , both of which now prepared to head north with the I SS Panzer Corps . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 While the Normandy landings in all five sectors managed to establish footholds in Normandy , many D @-@ Day objectives were not met . The 82nd and 101st American Airborne Divisions had suffered heavy casualties — their landings were scattered all over the <unk> — but had captured Sainte @-@ Mère @-@ Église to the west of Utah . On the Cotentin Peninsula , the American 4th Division had suffered lighter casualties in securing Utah , and had established a strong bridgehead by the end of D @-@ Day . Omaha had met with less success , as intact defences and high @-@ calibre troops of the 352nd Division caused heavier casualties than at any of the other beaches ; at one point the attack was going so badly that Lieutenant General Omar Bradley considered withdrawing the US V Corps from the beaches . A second wave of attacks breached the coastal defences , but could only push 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) inland by nightfall . To the west of Juno , the British 50th ( Northumbrian ) Infantry Division encountered only light resistance , and succeeded in advancing inland and creating a continuous front with Juno ( though not with Omaha ) with only 413 casualties . To their east , the British 3rd Infantry Division succeeded in establishing a foothold on Sword . However , counter @-@ attacks by the 21st Panzer Division in the afternoon prevented the 3rd Infantry from advancing on Caen and from making contact with the Canadian 3rd on Juno . The counter @-@ attack did not succeed in driving the British off the beaches , as units of the British 6th Airborne Division — which had landed the previous night near the River Orne — were able to outflank the 21st and force it to withdraw . 
 In spite of the heavy casualties inflicted on the 352nd and 716th Infantry Divisions , the German Seventh Army quickly established plans for counter @-@ attacks . Early logistical responses to the invasion were confused , as the divisions necessary for counter @-@ attacks fell under a different jurisdiction than those defending the coast . Furthermore , the heavy Panzer divisions , such as the Panzer Lehr , 12th SS Panzer , and 2nd SS Panzer , could not be mobilized to the coast without the explicit authorization of Hitler himself . The order to mobilize Panzer Lehr and the 12th SS was finally given in the mid @-@ afternoon of 6 June . When the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade and the Sherbrooke Fusiliers began to advance on 7 June , they were met by entrenched forces of the 716th Infantry and 21st Panzer Divisions . At 17 : 00 , the advancing force was counter @-@ attacked by the 12th SS , under the command of Kurt Meyer . After heavy fighting the 9th Brigade was forced to withdraw to their D @-@ Day positions , having suffered heavier casualties than any single unit on Juno itself the previous day . However , the 7th Brigade succeeded in reaching its final D @-@ Day objectives along Line Oak , while the 8th Brigade attempted to destroy German radar stations to their east , a task which would only be completed on 11 June . 
 The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division made contact with the British on Sword on 7 June , before forming one continuous front with the American sector by 13 June . The subsequent advance on Caen and Cherbourg was slow , as a greater number of German Panzer units were concentrated near Caen and Carentan . The Canadians captured Carpiquet Airfield during Operation Windsor on 5 July , while Anglo @-@ Canadian forces captured Caen as part of Operation Charnwood ( 8 – 9 July ) and Operation Atlantic ( 18 – 20 July ) . 
 = = = Casualties = = = 
 Initial predictions for the likely casualties on Juno had been very high , approaching 2 @,@ 000 , including 600 drowned . In the end , the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division suffered the following casualties : 340 killed , 574 wounded and 47 taken prisoner . The Queen 's Own Rifles suffered the heaviest , with 143 casualties , the Royal Winnipegs 128 , the North Shore 125 and the Regina Rifles 108 . Of the varied landing craft used on the run @-@ in to Juno , 90 of 306 were lost or damaged . Due to the breakdown of logistics on D @-@ Day the exact numbers of casualties for the German 716th Infantry Division is unknown . However , of the division 's four German battalions numbering 7 @,@ 771 men before the invasion , Richter reported that the equivalent of only one battalion — at 80 per cent strength — remained . At least one of the two conscript battalions of the 716th was reported to have fled . Richter also reported that 80 per cent of the division 's artillery had been destroyed or captured on D @-@ Day , while only two gun batteries were intact west of the River Orne . By 9 June , the division had been reduced to a battlegroup of 292 officers and men . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 = = = Preliminary bombardment = = = 
 Military historians have generally drawn the conclusion that the preliminary aerial and naval bombardment of Juno was not as effective as had been hoped , yet differ in their opinions as to how ineffective . The aerial bombardment of Juno 's defences the night before is considered to have been very ineffective , primarily because of the inclement weather . John Keegan notes that " the prevailing low , thick cloud frustrated its [ Bomber Command 's ] efforts " . Colonel Stacey — the official historian of the Canadian Army in the Second World War — considers the effects of the bombing runs to have been " spotty " , noting that while several coastal batteries were not hit , those that were ( such as the battery at Houlgate ) were hit accurately . Chester Wilmot offers a different view , suggesting that " [ the coastal guns ] had been accurately bombed , but had survived because they were heavily protected by the concrete casemates Rommel had insisted upon " . Historians ' assessment of the naval bombardment is even more mixed ; while they generally agree that it failed to fully neutralize German defences on Juno , they are in disagreement as to why . Stacey suggests that while the " beach @-@ drenching fire " was concentrated and substantial , it was both inaccurate and of insufficient firepower to destroy the coastal bunkers . He further suggests that the effect of the drenching fire was moral rather than material , in that it forced defenders to keep below @-@ ground and sapped their morale . Terry Copp echoes this analysis , noting that " reasonable accuracy could not be obtained from the pitching decks of LCTs [ by mounted artillery on the ships ] " ; the 13th Field Regiment 's drenching fire fell on average 200 yards ( 180 m ) past their targets . British historian Max Hastings notes that because of the delay in landing times by ten minutes , a substantial gap existed between the cessation of bombardment and the actual landing of the first waves of infantry , meaning that platoons of the 716th had ample time to return to their positions . The bombardment of specific strongpoints in the towns along the coast was inconsistent ; the North Shore Regiment reported that the strongpoint near Saint @-@ Aubin " appeared not to have been touched " by bombardment , while the strongpoints facing the Canadian Scottish Regiment had been eliminated by naval bombardment before their landing . 
 = = = Overall = = = 
 Despite the failure to capture any of the final D @-@ Day objectives , the assault on Juno is generally considered — alongside Utah — the most strategically successful of the D @-@ Day landings . Historians suggest a variety of reasons for this success . Mark <unk> notes that " the Canadians ended the day ahead of either the US or British divisions despite the facts that they landed last and that only the Americans at Omaha faced more difficulty winning a toehold on the sand " , suggesting that the calibre of the training the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had received beforehand explains their success . Chester Wilmot claims that the Canadian success in clearing the landing zones is attributable to the presence of amphibious DD tanks on the beaches ; he also notes that the absence of DD tanks was largely responsible for the heavier casualties on Omaha — the only beach with heavier resistance than Juno . Canadian historian Terry Copp attributes the steady advance of the 7th Brigade in the afternoon to " less serious opposition " than the North Shore Regiment encountered in Tailleville . 
 Despite the verdict of a successful D @-@ Day for the 3rd CID , the failure of Canadian units to reach their final objectives has proven more disputed than the reasons for their success . Terry Copp places the blame on Keller , who committed the entirety of the 9th Brigade reserve to land on the narrower beaches of the 8th Brigade — which was itself still fighting to clear the seaside towns — after receiving reports of poor progress by the 7th Brigade . Dutch historian Dan Van der Vat notes that " the planned breakout of the 9th Brigade was held up by a huge jam of vehicles " . Wilmot also places the blame with logistical difficulties of the landing , saying that " on the whole it was not so much the opposition in front as the congestion behind — on the beaches and in Bernières — that prevented the Canadians from reaching their final D @-@ Day objective " . Stacey offers a different view , suggesting that it was not impossible for the 3rd CID to reach its D @-@ Day objectives , and that the failure to do so rests in the fact that " British and Canadian forces were usually better at deceiving the enemy and achieving initial success in an assault than they were at exploiting surprise and success once achieved . Perhaps they were rather too easily satisfied " . Copp disagrees with Stacey 's assessment , suggesting that such caution was not the result of poor planning but of the fact that " the British and Canadians fought the way they had been trained , moving forward to designated objectives in controlled bounds and digging in at the first sign of a counterattack " . He also disputes whether the capture of the final objectives would have been strategically intelligent , observing that " if 9th Brigade had reached Carpiquet and dug in , with artillery in position to offer support , the commander of the 26th Panzer Grenadiers might have followed orders and waited until a coordinated counterattack with other divisions had been organized . Such an attack might well have done far more damage to the Allied beachhead than the hastily improvised operation actually carried out [ on 7 June ] " . 
 Stacey offers a second line of analysis on the Canadians ' failure to advance to Line Oak , suggesting that difficulties encountered by the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword caused Dempsey to halt the advance of the entire British Second Army . The British encountered heavy counterattacks by the 21st Panzer Division , which prevented the British 9th Brigade from establishing contact with the Canadians at Juno . Copp offers agreement on this assessment , writing : " Before this withdrawal [ of the 21st Panzer Division ] became evident , Dempsey had concluded that more armoured counterattacks could be expected . So he ordered all three assault divisions to dig in at their second line of objectives . This decision was relayed to subordinate commanders somewhere after 19 : 00 " , just as the 9th Canadian Brigade was preparing to advance south towards Carpiquet . Wilmot also agrees with this analysis , arguing that the British 3rd Infantry Division 's brigade commanders were overly cautious in advancing towards Caen . This , in turn , slowed the momentum of the entire Anglo @-@ Canadian advance , especially given the reports of counterattacks Dempsey received from Sword .

 Robert William Trevor Key ( born 12 May 1979 ) is an English former cricketer . He represented Kent County Cricket Club and is a former member of the England Test match and One Day International sides . 
 A right @-@ handed opening batsman , Key made appearances at age @-@ group level for Kent from the age of eleven , moving up until he made his first @-@ class debut in 1998 . He made eight first @-@ class and 4 List A appearances for England 's youth sides , and was a member of the side which won the 1998 Under @-@ 19 Cricket World Cup . Following a season of heavy run @-@ scoring , Key was called up to the England A side in 1999 . 
 Following an injury to Marcus Trescothick , Key made his Test debut against India in 2002 . He toured Australia during the 2002 – 03 Ashes series , where he justified his selection ahead of a more experienced player . His One Day International debut came in 2003 , against Zimbabwe , however he was dropped from both squads shortly after . Injury to Mark Butcher allowed Key back into the England side for the series against the West Indies in 2004 . He scored his maiden Test hundred in the first match of the series , which later became his maiden first @-@ class double century as he scored 221 . This performance , coupled with the 93 he scored in the third Test , earned him recognition as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year . Key 's last Test matches came during England 's tour of South Africa during 2004 – 05 , where he managed to score 152 runs without being consistent , and despite a one @-@ match return during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 , he has remained on the fringes of selection . 
 Key became Kent captain following the 2006 English cricket season , following David Fulton 's resignation . He led Kent to a County Championship 2nd Division Championship title in 2010 , two Twenty20 Cup Finals Day appearances and a Friends Provident Trophy final . He resigned as Kent captain following the 2012 English cricket season and James Tredwell became club captain . Key only had one season off as captain as Tredwell then himself resigned and Key was named as his replacement , captaining the county for another two years until the end of the 2015 season . 
 Key was a regular commentator on Sky Sports TV 's coverage of county cricket while still a player at Kent . He can also be found as a studio pundit on the channel 's coverage of international tours in the English close @-@ season . 
 In April 2016 , Key announced his retirement from all forms of cricket .

 Born in East Dulwich , London to parents Trevor and Lynn , Key was raised in a particularly sporting family : his mother played for Kent 's ladies cricket side , his father played club cricket in Derby and his sister Elizabeth played for her junior school side , where she once took a hat @-@ trick . Key himself was a keen all @-@ round sportsman ; he also played tennis for Kent . 
 He attended Worsley Bridge Primary School where the school won both the Bromley area and Kent cricket Cups . His performances led to his inclusion in the county under @-@ elevens , before Alan <unk> , coach of Kent County Cricket Club 's youth sides , became his mentor . Later he attended <unk> 's School in Lee , London and Langley Park School for Boys in Beckenham , where he passed ten GCSEs . 
 Key has often been criticized for his weight , and at one stage early in his career weighed 16 stone before Alec Stewart told him to " buck his ideas up " . Key himself said of the matter : " I 'll never be the most athletic @-@ looking bloke , but I 'm a hell of a lot fitter than I was at 19 or 20 . "

He remained a regular in the second team throughout the 1996 season and first half of the 1997 season , by which time he had hit his first two centuries for a Kent representative side ; an unbeaten 146 against Essex 's second team , and an unbeaten 139 against Glamorgan 's seconds . 
 Following on from those performances , Key joined the England Under @-@ 17 squad for the International Youth Tournament , which was being held in Bermuda . Key 's growing reputation as a batsman was greatly enhanced by his performances in this tournament , where he finished with the second highest batting average of anyone at the tournament , scoring 184 runs at an average of 48 . Key 's performances helped England win the tournament by a single point from Ireland 's Under @-@ 17s . 
 Key returned to England for two matches with Kent 's second team , before joining up with England 's Under @-@ 19s for a youth Test series against Zimbabwe 's under @-@ 19s . In the three Test series , Key made two half @-@ centuries , earning himself a place in the squad for the 1998 Under @-@ 19 Cricket World Cup in South Africa . Batting at the top of the order throughout , Key scored a total of 206 runs as England won the tournament , with his best performance coming in the defeat to India , where Key scored 57 . 
 Following a first @-@ class debut against Middlesex at the beginning of the 1998 season , in which Key scored 15 , he proceeded to play a near @-@ complete season . He scored his first first @-@ class century against Durham , scoring 101 in an innings victory . He added a second century ( 115 ) against Nottinghamshire , before rejoining the England under @-@ 19 squad for the series against Pakistan under @-@ 19s . He struggled in the one @-@ day series , scoring just 36 runs in three matches , but finished as the top run @-@ scorer in the youth Tests ; with 377 at an average of 62 @.@ 83 .

 The 1999 season began for Key with a call up to England A 's tour of Zimbabwe through January and February . He struggled for runs throughout his five matches on the tour , failing to pass 26 in any innings . In all , Key managed one century in the calendar year , 125 against Somerset , and finished the year with 1 @,@ 309 runs in all competitions . The 2000 season proved even more disappointing , with just 700 runs at an average of less than 20 . 
 The 2001 English cricket season saw Key 's form improve , with him scoring four first @-@ class centuries ; including one against the touring Pakistanis . His highest score of the season and career to date would come in the final game — he scored 132 in a rain @-@ affected match against Lancashire . His scoring throughout the season persuaded the national selectors to include him in the National Academy , which went on a winter tour of Australia , where he showed his ability with an innings of 177 against the side 's Australian counterparts . 
 He continued his good form into 2002 , where his run @-@ scoring earned him an invitation to play for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the Sri Lankans . He scored 77 in a drawn match , and would later that season make his Test match debut against India . However , following his Test debut , he only passed 50 on one further occasion that year . He would maintain his place in the Test side against Zimbabwe the following year , despite only scoring one innings of note — 129 against the Cambridge students . However , after being dropped from the side , Key 's form seemed to improve : he scored 140 against Nottinghamshire to set up a Kent victory , and consistently scored around 40 runs per innings for the remainder of the season . 
 The 2004 English cricket season saw Key hit top form for the first time , scoring a total of 2 @,@ 486 runs in all competitions . This total included a " majestic " unbeaten 118 in the opening game of the season against Gloucestershire , during which Key did not offer a single chance throughout . He reached the thousand run milestone for the season on 2 June , the earliest date the milestone had been reached since 1978 , and went on a run that included five centuries in seven innings . He was then recalled to the England squad for the series against the West Indies , and Key played two key innings : 221 at Lord 's , and his second innings 93 not out to win the third Test for England . Following the series Key returned to the domestic scene , and finished the season with two further tons ; 131 against both Northamptonshire and Middlesex . 
 Following the winter international series in South Africa , Key returned to domestic action with Kent . While not having as successful a season as in the previous year , he still scored over 1 @,@ 500 runs . This included two centuries in the same match against Surrey , during the second of which he shared a county third @-@ wicket record partnership of 323 with Martin van <unk> . At the end of the season , Key was named the new county captain following the resignation of David Fulton , a role he took on in order to help his chances of regaining a place in the England side . 
 His first season as captain saw his form slide , as Kent 's chairman of cricket Graham Johnson related at the end of the season : " His commitment to the team has probably impacted on his own form " . Nonetheless , he was given the captaincy of the England A team in their fixture against Pakistan , and led Kent to fifth place in the top tier of the County Championship . The following season saw Key lead Kent to silverware , whilst returning to some of his best form . He struck a total of eight centuries , and amassed a total of 2 @,@ 267 runs in all competitions , whilst also leading Kent to the finals day of the 2007 Twenty20 Cup , in which Kent defeated Sussex and Gloucestershire to claim the trophy . However , Key was later found <unk> of " serious dissent " following his controversial dismissal in the final . 
 He continued his run @-@ scoring into 2008 , where he scored an unbeaten 178 against the touring New Zealanders to " lift himself firmly into the Test reckoning " . Following Michael Vaughan 's resignation as England captain , Key was touted by the some people in the media as a potential candidate for the job . However , the season ended badly for Key , as under his captaincy Kent were relegated to the second tier of the County Championship for the first time , with Key also being fined £ 1 @,@ 250 for comments he made over an ECB pitch panel decision in August . 
 Key took his first wicket in first @-@ class cricket on the final day of Kent 's draw with Northamptonshire at the start of the 2009 season . He went on to score 1 @,@ 209 runs that season , with four centuries including a career @-@ best 270 * , at 50 @.@ 37 runs per innings . It was the sixth time he had passed one thousand runs in a season . He came close to beating this score the following season when , on 17 May 2010 , he scored 261 against Durham . He had , until that match , struggled with the bat - averaging only 14 @.@ 30 in the County Championship . 
 He announced his retirement from the game on 18 April 2016 , citing his desire to not " hinder younger players [ coming through ] " and focus on coaching and his role with SKY Sports as a television pundit .

 Key made his Test match debut in the second Test against India in 2002 , as a replacement for Marcus Trescothick , who had broken his thumb . Chairman of selectors David Graveney said Key was selected because of his " outstanding form for Kent after attending the National Academy " over the winter . Opening the batting with Michael Vaughan , Key made 17 runs in his only innings before being bowled by Ashish Nehra . Retained in the side for the third Test , Key managed scored 30 and 34 as England succumbed to an innings defeat . However , his performance was marred by him dropping three catches . Key was dropped from the fourth and final Test , with Trescothick replacing him having been rushed back from injury .

 After success in domestic cricket and promise shown in his Test appearances previously , Key was selected as part of the squad to play Australia . Despite playing well in a limited overs match against an ACB Chairman 's XI ; hitting 68 , he was not selected to play in the first Test , instead acting as twelfth man . He ended up fielding to a greater extent than he would have imagined , after Simon Jones ruptured knee ligaments while fielding , and took no further part in the match . 
 Brought back into the side for the second Test for the injured John Crawley , Key made a solitary run in the first innings , batting at number three , before being caught off the bowling of Shane Warne just after the lunch break . Relegated to number five in the second innings , with Mark Butcher and Nasser Hussain batting ahead of him , he again made just one before being caught off Andy Bichel . 
 Key fared better in the third match , played at the WACA Ground in Perth . On a pitch with " exceptional bounce and pace " , Key was the only English batsman to keep his wicket intact for a prolonged period , batting passively for 47 , the highest score of the innings . He then caught Brett Lee at third man in Australia 's only innings , before offering Hussain " stout support " in making 23 second time around . England lost the Test match by an innings and 48 runs , a result that ensured that Australia retained the Ashes . 
 Following a break for the first part of the VB Series of One Day Internationals , England moved to Melbourne for the fourth Test . Unfortunately for Key , he fell for a duck in the first innings , trapped leg before wicket ( lbw ) second ball by fast bowler Brett Lee . With England following on , Key made a maiden half @-@ century to ensure Australia had to bat again . He eventually fell just after the new ball was taken , caught at second slip for 52 . 
 The final Test , played at the Sydney Cricket Ground , saw England attempting to avoid a series whitewash . Key scored three runs in England 's first innings , before falling lbw to an innocuous half @-@ volley from Steve Waugh , playing in his last Ashes Test . He scored 14 in his final innings of the tour , before being caught at midwicket , however England had nearly 350 runs on the board by that stage and were on track to complete a consolatory victory . The 2004 edition of the Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack recorded that Key had " justified his selection ahead of an older player , like Mark Ramprakash , but did not cement his place " .

 Despite a low @-@ scoring start to the 2003 English cricket season , in which he passed 40 only once in his first seven innings of the season , he kept his place in the Test side for the visit of the touring Zimbabweans . Batting at number five in both Tests , Key failed to make much of an impact , scoring 18 runs in the first match and four in the second . He had reason to feel aggrieved at his first Test dismissal — umpire Steve <unk> gave him out caught behind , despite Key not hitting the ball . 
 His inclusion in the One Day International ( ODI ) squad for the following NatWest Series against Zimbabwe and South Africa owed more to the lack of available players than his own form ; he had only passed 40 on one occasion going into the series . Key made his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in the opening match of the tournament ; he scored 11 before falling to the left @-@ arm spin of Ray Price . Key only played one more match in the series ; against South Africa he fell for a golden duck taking a " wild swing " at the first ball he received from Makhaya Ntini . Following England 's qualification into the final of the tournament , Key was released from the squad " to have some match @-@ practice in the longer form of the game ahead of the Test series " against South Africa . However , Key did not make an appearance in the series .

 Key returned to the Test match side after an excellent start to the 2004 season . He reached 1 @,@ 000 runs for the season by 2 June , the earliest date the milestone had been reached for 16 years , and had a run of five centuries in seven innings . However , his limited @-@ overs form was not as good — he passed fifty only once all season . Despite this , he was called into the squad for the NatWest Series against the West Indies and New Zealand . 
 Key 's series began with the fifth match of the tournament ; against the West Indies at Headingley . With England chasing 160 to win , Key came in at 55 for one , but scored just six before being bowled by Dwayne Bravo . His only other appearance came against New Zealand towards the end of the group stage — Key scored 18 and was playing well before being caught behind . 
 His place in the Test side was ensured after Mark Butcher pulled out , having been hit from behind in his car and sustaining a whiplash injury . Key took the opportunity , moving toward a maiden Test century with what Wisden described as " powerful driving and pulling " . He was dropped twice — Chris Gayle parried an opportunity with Key on 16 , while Devon Smith failed to dismiss him when on 58 . Key maintained his concentration throughout , even after meeting the Queen in a presentation during the tea interval . He brought up his century with a boundary off the bowling of Fidel Edwards , and by the end of the first day had reached 167 not out . He continued positively on the second day , and brought up his maiden double century with four through square leg off Pedro Collins . He was eventually dismissed when he " slashed a wide ball to Brian Lara at backward point " , having made 221 . In the second innings , he was run out by his captain Michael Vaughan , who went on to score his second century of the match . 
 The second Test saw Key struggling in the corridor of uncertainty , a characteristic highlighted by Collins , who beat the bat on several occasions before finding the edge to dismiss him . His second innings lasted just seven balls before Key " chipped a simple catch to mid @-@ on " , having scored just four . 
 Key 's most valuable innings , according to Wisden , came in the third Test . Despite only scoring six runs in the first innings , Key came to the crease for his second innings with England requiring another 216 runs to take a 3 – 0 lead in the series . Initially batting with Michael Vaughan , and then with Andrew Flintoff , Key scored an unbeaten 93 to guide England to their target , which was a record fourth innings total to win an Old Trafford Test . His series came to an end when he scored ten runs , in England 's ten @-@ wicket victory in the final Test . 
 Key 's performances in the series and his domestic form earned him recognition — he was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 2005 edition .

 Following on from his performances during the series against the West Indies , Key was taken on England 's tour of South Africa over the English close @-@ season . However , with Mark Butcher returning to the side following injury , Key lost his place . This was despite him scoring 87 in a warm @-@ up game against a Nicky Oppenheimer XI , a match in which Butcher had scored just six . Returning to the side for the third Test after Butcher had sustained a wrist injury , Key made a duck in the first innings , before " defending resolutely " in accumulating 41 before being stumped charging Nicky <unk> . 
 The fourth Test , played at the Wanderers , saw Key hit 83 , in a partnership of 182 with Andrew Strauss that Wisden described as including " hard @-@ hitting support from Key " . He added a further eighteen to his match tally in the second innings , a contribution which helped England to an eventual victory . Key returned single figure scores of one and nine in his two innings in the final Test , being dismissed by Shaun Pollock on both occasions in a rain @-@ affected draw .
