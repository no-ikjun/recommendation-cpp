 = = = Independent emergence on Earth = = = 
 Life on Earth is based on carbon and water . Carbon provides stable frameworks for complex chemicals and can be easily extracted from the environment , especially from carbon dioxide . There is no other chemical element whose properties are similar enough to carbon 's to be called an analogue ; silicon , the element directly below carbon on the periodic table , does not form very many complex stable molecules , and because most of its compounds are water @-@ insoluble , it would be more difficult for organisms to extract . The elements boron and phosphorus have more complex chemistries , but suffer from other limitations relative to carbon . Water is an excellent solvent and has two other useful properties : the fact that ice floats enables aquatic organisms to survive beneath it in winter ; and its molecules have electrically negative and positive ends , which enables it to form a wider range of compounds than other solvents can . Other good solvents , such as ammonia , are liquid only at such low temperatures that chemical reactions may be too slow to sustain life , and lack water 's other advantages . Organisms based on alternative biochemistry may , however , be possible on other planets . 
 Research on how life might have emerged from non @-@ living chemicals focuses on three possible starting points : self @-@ replication , an organism 's ability to produce offspring that are very similar to itself ; metabolism , its ability to feed and repair itself ; and external cell membranes , which allow food to enter and waste products to leave , but exclude unwanted substances . Research on abiogenesis still has a long way to go , since theoretical and empirical approaches are only beginning to make contact with each other . 
 = = = = Replication first : RNA world = = = = 
 Even the simplest members of the three modern domains of life use DNA to record their " recipes " and a complex array of RNA and protein molecules to " read " these instructions and use them for growth , maintenance and self @-@ replication . The discovery that some RNA molecules can catalyze both their own replication and the construction of proteins led to the hypothesis of earlier life @-@ forms based entirely on RNA . These ribozymes could have formed an RNA world in which there were individuals but no species , as mutations and horizontal gene transfers would have meant that the offspring in each generation were quite likely to have different genomes from those that their parents started with . RNA would later have been replaced by DNA , which is more stable and therefore can build longer genomes , expanding the range of capabilities a single organism can have . <unk> remain as the main components of ribosomes , modern cells ' " protein factories . " 
 Although short self @-@ replicating RNA molecules have been artificially produced in laboratories , doubts have been raised about where natural non @-@ biological synthesis of RNA is possible . The earliest " ribozymes " may have been formed of simpler nucleic acids such as PNA , TNA or GNA , which would have been replaced later by RNA . 
 In 2003 , it was proposed that porous metal sulfide precipitates would assist RNA synthesis at about 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) and ocean @-@ bottom pressures near hydrothermal vents . Under this hypothesis , lipid membranes would be the last major cell components to appear and , until then , the <unk> would be confined to the pores . 
 = = = = Metabolism first : Iron – sulfur world = = = = 
 A series of experiments starting in 1997 showed that early stages in the formation of proteins from inorganic materials including carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide could be achieved by using iron sulfide and nickel sulfide as catalysts . Most of the steps required temperatures of about 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) and moderate pressures , although one stage required 250 ° C ( 482 ° F ) and a pressure equivalent to that found under 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) of rock . Hence it was suggested that self @-@ sustaining synthesis of proteins could have occurred near hydrothermal vents . 
 = = = = Membranes first : Lipid world = = = = 
 It has been suggested that double @-@ walled " bubbles " of lipids like those that form the external membranes of cells may have been an essential first step . Experiments that simulated the conditions of the early Earth have reported the formation of lipids , and these can spontaneously form liposomes , double @-@ walled " bubbles , " and then reproduce themselves . Although they are not intrinsically information @-@ carriers as nucleic acids are , they would be subject to natural selection for longevity and reproduction . Nucleic acids such as RNA might then have formed more easily within the liposomes than they would have outside . 
 = = = = The clay hypothesis = = = = 
 RNA is complex and there are doubts about whether it can be produced non @-@ biologically in the wild . Some clays , notably montmorillonite , have properties that make them plausible accelerators for the emergence of an RNA world : they grow by self @-@ replication of their crystalline pattern ; they are subject to an analog of natural selection , as the clay " species " that grows fastest in a particular environment rapidly becomes dominant ; and they can catalyze the formation of RNA molecules . Although this idea has not become the scientific consensus , it still has active supporters . 
 Research in 2003 reported that montmorillonite could also accelerate the conversion of fatty acids into " bubbles , " and that the " bubbles " could encapsulate RNA attached to the clay . These " bubbles " can then grow by absorbing additional lipids and then divide . The formation of the earliest cells may have been aided by similar processes . 
 A similar hypothesis presents self @-@ replicating iron @-@ rich clays as the progenitors of nucleotides , lipids and amino acids . 
 = = Environmental and evolutionary impact of microbial mats = = 
 Microbial mats are multi @-@ layered , multi @-@ species colonies of bacteria and other organisms that are generally only a few millimeters thick , but still contain a wide range of chemical environments , each of which favors a different set of microorganisms . To some extent each mat forms its own food chain , as the by @-@ products of each group of microorganisms generally serve as " food " for adjacent groups . 
 Stromatolites are stubby pillars built as microorganisms in mats slowly migrate upwards to avoid being smothered by sediment deposited on them by water . There has been vigorous debate about the validity of alleged fossils from before 3 Ga , with critics arguing that so @-@ called stromatolites could have been formed by non @-@ biological processes . In 2006 , another find of stromatolites was reported from the same part of Australia as previous ones , in rocks dated to 3 @.@ 5 Ga . 
 In modern underwater mats the top layer often consists of photosynthesizing cyanobacteria which create an oxygen @-@ rich environment , while the bottom layer is oxygen @-@ free and often dominated by hydrogen sulfide emitted by the organisms living there . It is estimated that the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria in mats increased biological productivity by a factor of between 100 and 1 @,@ 000 . The reducing agent used by oxygenic photosynthesis is water , which is much more plentiful than the geologically produced reducing agents required by the earlier non @-@ oxygenic photosynthesis . From this point onwards life itself produced significantly more of the resources it needed than did geochemical processes . Oxygen is toxic to organisms that are not adapted to it , but greatly increases the metabolic efficiency of oxygen @-@ adapted organisms . Oxygen became a significant component of Earth 's atmosphere about 2 @.@ 4 Ga . Although eukaryotes may have been present much earlier , the oxygenation of the atmosphere was a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells , from which all multicellular organisms are built . The boundary between oxygen @-@ rich and oxygen @-@ free layers in microbial mats would have moved upwards when photosynthesis shut down overnight , and then downwards as it resumed on the next day . This would have created selection pressure for organisms in this intermediate zone to acquire the ability to tolerate and then to use oxygen , possibly via endosymbiosis , where one organism lives inside another and both of them benefit from their association . 
 Cyanobacteria have the most complete biochemical " toolkits " of all the mat @-@ forming organisms . Hence they are the most self @-@ sufficient of the mat organisms and were well @-@ adapted to strike out on their own both as floating mats and as the first of the phytoplankton , providing the basis of most marine food chains . 
 = = Diversification of eukaryotes = = 
 = = = <unk> , nucleus , endomembrane system , and mitochondria = = = 
 Eukaryotes may have been present long before the oxygenation of the atmosphere , but most modern eukaryotes require oxygen , which their mitochondria use to fuel the production of ATP , the internal energy supply of all known cells . In the 1970s it was proposed and , after much debate , widely accepted that eukaryotes emerged as a result of a sequence of endosymbiosis between " prokaryotes . " For example : a predatory microorganism invaded a large prokaryote , probably an archaean , but the attack was neutralized , and the attacker took up residence and evolved into the first of the mitochondria ; one of these chimeras later tried to swallow a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium , but the victim survived inside the attacker and the new combination became the ancestor of plants ; and so on . After each endosymbiosis began , the partners would have eliminated unproductive duplication of genetic functions by re @-@ arranging their genomes , a process which sometimes involved transfer of genes between them . Another hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were originally <unk> or hydrogen @-@ metabolising endosymbionts , and became oxygen @-@ consumers later . On the other hand , mitochondria might have been part of eukaryotes ' original equipment . 
 There is a debate about when eukaryotes first appeared : the presence of <unk> in Australian shales may indicate that eukaryotes were present 2 @.@ 7 Ga ; however , an analysis in 2008 concluded that these chemicals infiltrated the rocks less than 2 @.@ 2 Ga and prove nothing about the origins of eukaryotes . Fossils of the algae <unk> have been reported in 1 @.@ 85 billion @-@ year @-@ old rocks ( originally dated to 2 @.@ 1 Ga but later revised ) , and indicates that eukaryotes with organelles had already evolved . A diverse collection of fossil algae were found in rocks dated between 1 @.@ 5 and 1 @.@ 4 Ga . The earliest known fossils of fungi date from 1 @.@ 43 Ga . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> are thought to have originated from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria . The symbiosis evolved around 1 @.@ 5 Ga and enabled eukaryotes to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis . Three evolutionary lineages have since emerged in which the plastids are named differently : chloroplasts in green algae and plants , <unk> in red algae and <unk> in the <unk> . 
 = = Sexual reproduction and multicellular organisms = = 
 = = = Evolution of sexual reproduction = = = 
 The defining characteristics of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes are meiosis and fertilization . There is much genetic recombination in this kind of reproduction , in which offspring receive 50 % of their genes from each parent , in contrast with asexual reproduction , in which there is no recombination . Bacteria also exchange DNA by bacterial conjugation , the benefits of which include resistance to antibiotics and other toxins , and the ability to utilize new metabolites . However , conjugation is not a means of reproduction , and is not limited to members of the same species – there are cases where bacteria transfer DNA to plants and animals . 
 On the other hand , bacterial transformation is clearly an adaptation for transfer of DNA between bacteria of the same species . Bacterial transformation is a complex process involving the products of numerous bacterial genes and can be regarded as a bacterial form of sex . This process occurs naturally in at least 67 prokaryotic species ( in seven different phyla ) . Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes may have evolved from bacterial transformation . ( Also see Evolution of sexual reproduction # Origin of sexual reproduction . ) 
 The disadvantages of sexual reproduction are well @-@ known : the genetic reshuffle of recombination may break up favorable combinations of genes ; and since males do not directly increase the number of offspring in the next generation , an asexual population can out @-@ breed and displace in as little as 50 generations a sexual population that is equal in every other respect . Nevertheless , the great majority of animals , plants , fungi and protists reproduce sexually . There is strong evidence that sexual reproduction arose early in the history of eukaryotes and that the genes controlling it have changed very little since then . How sexual reproduction evolved and survived is an unsolved puzzle . 
 The Red Queen hypothesis suggests that sexual reproduction provides protection against parasites , because it is easier for parasites to evolve means of overcoming the defenses of genetically identical clones than those of sexual species that present moving targets , and there is some experimental evidence for this . However , there is still doubt about whether it would explain the survival of sexual species if multiple similar clone species were present , as one of the clones may survive the attacks of parasites for long enough to out @-@ breed the sexual species . Furthermore , contrary to the expectations of the Red Queen hypothesis , Kathryn A. Hanley et al. found that the prevalence , abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat . In addition , biologist Matthew Parker , after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance , failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in the host . 
 Alexey <unk> 's deterministic mutation hypothesis ( <unk> ) assumes that each organism has more than one harmful mutation and the combined effects of these mutations are more harmful than the sum of the harm done by each individual mutation . If so , sexual recombination of genes will reduce the harm that bad mutations do to offspring and at the same time eliminate some bad mutations from the gene pool by isolating them in individuals that perish quickly because they have an above @-@ average number of bad mutations . However , the evidence suggests that the <unk> 's assumptions are shaky , because many species have on average less than one harmful mutation per individual and no species that has been investigated shows evidence of synergy between harmful mutations . ( Further criticisms of this hypothesis are discussed in the article Evolution of sexual reproduction # Removal of deleterious genes ) 
 The random nature of recombination causes the relative abundance of alternative traits to vary from one generation to another . This genetic drift is insufficient on its own to make sexual reproduction advantageous , but a combination of genetic drift and natural selection may be sufficient . When chance produces combinations of good traits , natural selection gives a large advantage to lineages in which these traits become genetically linked . On the other hand , the benefits of good traits are neutralized if they appear along with bad traits . Sexual recombination gives good traits the opportunities to become linked with other good traits , and mathematical models suggest this may be more than enough to offset the disadvantages of sexual reproduction . Other combinations of hypotheses that are inadequate on their own are also being examined . 
 The adaptive function of sex today remains a major unresolved issue in biology . The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by John A. Birdsell and Christopher Wills . The hypotheses discussed above all depend on possible beneficial effects of random genetic variation produced by genetic recombination . An alternative view is that sex arose , and is maintained , as a process for repairing DNA damage , and that the genetic variation produced is an occasionally beneficial byproduct . 
 = = = Multicellularity = = = 
 The simplest definitions of " multicellular , " for example " having multiple cells , " could include colonial cyanobacteria like Nostoc . Even a technical definition such as " having the same genome but different types of cell " would still include some genera of the green algae <unk> , which have cells that specialize in reproduction . Multicellularity evolved independently in organisms as diverse as sponges and other animals , fungi , plants , brown algae , cyanobacteria , slime molds and myxobacteria . For the sake of brevity , this article focuses on the organisms that show the greatest specialization of cells and variety of cell types , although this approach to the evolution of biological complexity could be regarded as " rather anthropocentric . " 
 The initial advantages of multicellularity may have included : more efficient sharing of nutrients that are digested outside the cell , increased resistance to predators , many of which attacked by engulfing ; the ability to resist currents by attaching to a firm surface ; the ability to reach upwards to filter @-@ feed or to obtain sunlight for photosynthesis ; the ability to create an internal environment that gives protection against the external one ; and even the opportunity for a group of cells to behave " intelligently " by sharing information . These features would also have provided opportunities for other organisms to diversify , by creating more varied environments than flat microbial mats could . 
 Multicellularity with differentiated cells is beneficial to the organism as a whole but disadvantageous from the point of view of individual cells , most of which lose the opportunity to reproduce themselves . In an asexual multicellular organism , rogue cells which retain the ability to reproduce may take over and reduce the organism to a mass of undifferentiated cells . Sexual reproduction eliminates such rogue cells from the next generation and therefore appears to be a prerequisite for complex multicellularity . 
 The available evidence indicates that eukaryotes evolved much earlier but remained inconspicuous until a rapid diversification around 1 Ga . The only respect in which eukaryotes clearly surpass bacteria and archaea is their capacity for variety of forms , and sexual reproduction enabled eukaryotes to exploit that advantage by producing organisms with multiple cells that differed in form and function . 
 By comparing the composition of transcription factor families and regulatory network motifs between unicellular organisms and multicellular organisms , scientists found there are many novel transcription factor families and three novel types of regulatory network motifs in multicellular organisms , and novel family transcription factors are preferentially wired into these novel network motifs which are essential for <unk> development . These results propose a plausible mechanism for the contribution of novel @-@ family transcription factors and novel network motifs to the origin of multicellular organisms at transcriptional regulatory level . 
 = = = Fossil evidence = = = 
 The Francevillian biota fossils , dated to 2 @.@ 1 Ga , are the earliest known fossil organisms that are clearly multicellular . They may have had differentiated cells . Another early multicellular fossil , <unk> , dated to 1 @.@ 7 Ga , appears to consist of virtually identical cells . The red algae called <unk> , dated at 1 @.@ 2 Ga , is the earliest known organism that certainly has differentiated , specialized cells , and is also the oldest known sexually reproducing organism . The 1 @.@ 43 billion @-@ year @-@ old fossils interpreted as fungi appear to have been multicellular with differentiated cells . The " string of beads " organism <unk> , found in rocks dated from 1 @.@ 5 Ga to 900 Ma , may have been an early metazoan ; however , it has also been interpreted as a colonial <unk> . 
 = = Emergence of animals = = 
 Animals are multicellular eukaryotes , and are distinguished from plants , algae , and fungi by lacking cell walls . All animals are motile , if only at certain life stages . All animals except sponges have bodies differentiated into separate tissues , including muscles , which move parts of the animal by contracting , and nerve tissue , which transmits and processes signals . 
 The earliest widely accepted animal fossils are the rather modern @-@ looking cnidarians ( the group that includes jellyfish , sea anemones and Hydra ) , possibly from around 580 Ma , although fossils from the Doushantuo Formation can only be dated approximately . Their presence implies that the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages had already diverged . 
 The Ediacara biota , which flourished for the last 40 million years before the start of the Cambrian , were the first animals more than a very few centimetres long . Many were flat and had a " quilted " appearance , and seemed so strange that there was a proposal to classify them as a separate kingdom , Vendozoa . Others , however , have been interpreted as early molluscs ( Kimberella ) , echinoderms ( <unk> ) , and arthropods ( Spriggina , Parvancorina ) . There is still debate about the classification of these specimens , mainly because the diagnostic features which allow taxonomists to classify more recent organisms , such as similarities to living organisms , are generally absent in the Ediacarans . However , there seems little doubt that Kimberella was at least a triploblastic bilaterian animal , in other words , an animal significantly more complex than the cnidarians . 
 The small shelly fauna are a very mixed collection of fossils found between the Late Ediacaran and Middle Cambrian periods . The earliest , Cloudina , shows signs of successful defense against predation and may indicate the start of an evolutionary arms race . Some tiny Early Cambrian shells almost certainly belonged to molluscs , while the owners of some " armor plates , " Halkieria and Microdictyon , were eventually identified when more complete specimens were found in Cambrian lagerstätten that preserved soft @-@ bodied animals . 
 In the 1970s there was already a debate about whether the emergence of the modern phyla was " explosive " or gradual but hidden by the shortage of Precambrian animal fossils . A re @-@ analysis of fossils from the Burgess Shale lagerstätte increased interest in the issue when it revealed animals , such as Opabinia , which did not fit into any known phylum . At the time these were interpreted as evidence that the modern phyla had evolved very rapidly in the Cambrian explosion and that the Burgess Shale 's " weird wonders " showed that the Early Cambrian was a uniquely experimental period of animal evolution . Later discoveries of similar animals and the development of new theoretical approaches led to the conclusion that many of the " weird wonders " were evolutionary " aunts " or " cousins " of modern groups — for example that Opabinia was a member of the lobopods , a group which includes the ancestors of the arthropods , and that it may have been closely related to the modern tardigrades . Nevertheless , there is still much debate about whether the Cambrian explosion was really explosive and , if so , how and why it happened and why it appears unique in the history of animals . 
 = = = <unk> and the first vertebrates = = = 
 Most of the animals at the heart of the Cambrian explosion debate are protostomes , one of the two main groups of complex animals . The other major group , the deuterostomes , contains invertebrates such as starfish and sea urchins ( echinoderms ) , as well as chordates ( see below ) . Many echinoderms have hard calcite " shells , " which are fairly common from the Early Cambrian small shelly fauna onwards . Other deuterostome groups are soft @-@ bodied , and most of the significant Cambrian deuterostome fossils come from the Chengjiang fauna , a lagerstätte in China . The chordates are another major deuterostome group : animals with a distinct dorsal nerve cord . <unk> include soft @-@ bodied invertebrates such as tunicates as well as vertebrates — animals with a backbone . While tunicate fossils predate the Cambrian explosion , the Chengjiang fossils <unk> and <unk> appear to be true vertebrates , and <unk> had distinct vertebrae , which may have been slightly mineralized . Vertebrates with jaws , such as the <unk> , first appeared in the Late Ordovician . 
 = = Colonization of land = = 
 Adaptation to life on land is a major challenge : all land organisms need to avoid drying @-@ out and all those above microscopic size must create special structures to withstand gravity ; respiration and gas exchange systems have to change ; reproductive systems cannot depend on water to carry eggs and sperm towards each other . Although the earliest good evidence of land plants and animals dates back to the Ordovician period ( 488 to 444 Ma ) , and a number of microorganism lineages made it onto land much earlier , modern land ecosystems only appeared in the Late Devonian , about 385 to 359 Ma . 
 = = = Evolution of terrestrial antioxidants = = = 
 Oxygen is a potent oxidant whose accumulation in terrestrial atmosphere resulted from the development of photosynthesis over 3 Ga , in cyanobacteria ( blue @-@ green algae ) , which were the most primitive oxygenic photosynthetic organisms . Brown algae accumulate inorganic mineral antioxidants such as rubidium , vanadium , zinc , iron , copper , molybdenum , selenium and iodine which is concentrated more than 30 @,@ 000 times the concentration of this element in seawater . Protective endogenous antioxidant enzymes and exogenous dietary antioxidants helped to prevent oxidative damage . Most marine mineral antioxidants act in the cells as essential trace elements in redox and antioxidant <unk> . 
 When plants and animals began to enter rivers and land about 500 Ma , environmental deficiency of these marine mineral antioxidants was a challenge to the evolution of terrestrial life . Terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of “ new ” endogenous antioxidants such as ascorbic acid , polyphenols , flavonoids , tocopherols , etc . A few of these appeared more recently , in last 200 @-@ 50 Ma , in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants . 
 In fact , angiosperms ( the dominant type of plant today ) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the Late Jurassic period . Plants employ antioxidants to defend their structures against reactive oxygen species produced during photosynthesis . Animals are exposed to the same oxidants , and they have evolved endogenous enzymatic antioxidant systems . Iodine is the most primitive and abundant electron @-@ rich essential element in the diet of marine and terrestrial organisms , and as iodide acts as an electron donor and has this ancestral antioxidant function in all iodide @-@ concentrating cells from primitive marine algae to more recent terrestrial vertebrates . 
 = = = Evolution of soil = = = 
 Before the colonization of land , soil , a combination of mineral particles and decomposed organic matter , did not exist . Land surfaces would have been either bare rock or unstable sand produced by weathering . Water and any nutrients in it would have drained away very quickly . 
 Films of cyanobacteria , which are not plants but use the same photosynthesis mechanisms , have been found in modern deserts , and only in areas that are unsuitable for vascular plants . This suggests that microbial mats may have been the first organisms to colonize dry land , possibly in the Precambrian . Mat @-@ forming cyanobacteria could have gradually evolved resistance to desiccation as they spread from the seas to intertidal zones and then to land . Lichens , which are symbiotic combinations of a fungus ( almost always an ascomycete ) and one or more photosynthesizers ( green algae or cyanobacteria ) , are also important colonizers of lifeless environments , and their ability to break down rocks contributes to soil formation in situations where plants cannot survive . The earliest known ascomycete fossils date from 423 to 419 Ma in the Silurian . 
 Soil formation would have been very slow until the appearance of burrowing animals , which mix the mineral and organic components of soil and whose feces are a major source of the organic components . Burrows have been found in Ordovician sediments , and are attributed to annelids ( " worms " ) or arthropods . 
 = = = Plants and the Late Devonian wood crisis = = = 
 In aquatic algae , almost all cells are capable of photosynthesis and are nearly independent . Life on land required plants to become internally more complex and specialized : photosynthesis was most efficient at the top ; roots were required in order to extract water from the ground ; the parts in between became supports and transport systems for water and nutrients . 
 Spores of land plants , possibly rather like liverworts , have been found in Middle Ordovician rocks dated to about 476 Ma . In Middle Silurian rocks 430 Ma , there are fossils of actual plants including clubmosses such as <unk> ; most were under 10 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) high , and some appear closely related to vascular plants , the group that includes trees . 
 By the Late Devonian 370 Ma , trees such as <unk> were so abundant that they changed river systems from mostly braided to mostly meandering , because their roots bound the soil firmly . In fact , they caused the " Late Devonian wood crisis " because : 
 They removed more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , reducing the greenhouse effect and thus causing an ice age in the Carboniferous period . In later ecosystems the carbon dioxide " locked up " in wood is returned to the atmosphere by decomposition of dead wood . However , the earliest fossil evidence of fungi that can decompose wood also comes from the Late Devonian . 
 The increasing depth of plants ' roots led to more washing of nutrients into rivers and seas by rain . This caused algal blooms whose high consumption of oxygen caused anoxic events in deeper waters , increasing the extinction rate among deep @-@ water animals . 
 = = = Land invertebrates = = = 
 Animals had to change their feeding and excretory systems , and most land animals developed internal fertilization of their eggs . The difference in refractive index between water and air required changes in their eyes . On the other hand , in some ways movement and breathing became easier , and the better transmission of high @-@ frequency sounds in air encouraged the development of hearing . 
 The oldest known air @-@ breathing animal is <unk> , an <unk> millipede from the Middle Silurian , about 428 Ma . Its air @-@ breathing , terrestrial nature is evidenced by the presence of spiracles , the openings to tracheal systems . However , some earlier trace fossils from the Cambrian @-@ Ordovician boundary about 490 Ma are interpreted as the tracks of large amphibious arthropods on coastal sand dunes , and may have been made by <unk> , which are thought to be evolutionary " aunts " of myriapods . Other trace fossils from the Late Ordovician a little over 445 Ma probably represent land invertebrates , and there is clear evidence of numerous arthropods on coasts and alluvial plains shortly before the Silurian @-@ Devonian boundary , about 415 Ma , including signs that some arthropods ate plants . Arthropods were well pre @-@ adapted to colonise land , because their existing jointed exoskeletons provided protection against desiccation , support against gravity and a means of locomotion that was not dependent on water . 
 The fossil record of other major invertebrate groups on land is poor : none at all for non @-@ parasitic flatworms , nematodes or nemerteans ; some parasitic nematodes have been fossilized in amber ; annelid worm fossils are known from the Carboniferous , but they may still have been aquatic animals ; the earliest fossils of gastropods on land date from the Late Carboniferous , and this group may have had to wait until leaf litter became abundant enough to provide the moist conditions they need . 
 The earliest confirmed fossils of flying insects date from the Late Carboniferous , but it is thought that insects developed the ability to fly in the Early Carboniferous or even Late Devonian . This gave them a wider range of ecological niches for feeding and breeding , and a means of escape from predators and from unfavorable changes in the environment . About 99 % of modern insect species fly or are descendants of flying species . 
 = = = Early land vertebrates = = = 
 <unk> , vertebrates with four limbs , evolved from other <unk> fish over a relatively short timespan during the Late Devonian ( 370 to 360 Ma ) . The early groups are grouped together as Labyrinthodontia . They retained aquatic , fry @-@ like tadpoles , a system still seen in modern amphibians . 
 Iodine and T4 / T3 stimulate the amphibian metamorphosis and the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic , vegetarian tadpole into a “ more <unk> ” terrestrial , carnivorous frog with better neurological , visuospatial , olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting . The new hormonal action of T3 was made possible by the formation of T3 @-@ receptors in the cells of vertebrates . Firstly , about 600 @-@ 500 million years ago , in primitive Chordata appeared the alpha T3 @-@ receptors with a metamorphosing action and then , about 250 @-@ 150 million years ago , in the Birds and Mammalia appeared the beta T3 @-@ receptors with metabolic and <unk> actions . 
 From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land , possibly in order to go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper . However , in 1987 , nearly complete fossils of Acanthostega from about 363 Ma showed that this Late Devonian transitional animal had legs and both lungs and gills , but could never have survived on land : its limbs and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight ; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight ; its fish @-@ like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground . The current hypothesis is that Acanthostega , which was about 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) long , was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water . Its skeleton differed from that of most fish , in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged , including : its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air ; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together , providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head ; the head is not joined to the shoulder girdle and it has a distinct neck . 
 The Devonian proliferation of land plants may help to explain why air breathing would have been an advantage : leaves falling into streams and rivers would have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation ; this would have attracted grazing invertebrates and small fish that preyed on them ; they would have been attractive prey but the environment was unsuitable for the big marine predatory fish ; air @-@ breathing would have been necessary because these waters would have been short of oxygen , since warm water holds less dissolved oxygen than cooler marine water and since the decomposition of vegetation would have used some of the oxygen . 
 Later discoveries revealed earlier transitional forms between Acanthostega and completely fish @-@ like animals . Unfortunately , there is then a gap ( Romer 's gap ) of about 30 Ma between the fossils of ancestral tetrapods and Middle Carboniferous fossils of vertebrates that look well @-@ adapted for life on land . Some of these look like early relatives of modern amphibians , most of which need to keep their skins moist and to lay their eggs in water , while others are accepted as early relatives of the amniotes , whose waterproof skin enables them to live and breed far from water . 
 = = Dinosaurs , birds and mammals = = 
 <unk> , whose eggs can survive in dry environments , probably evolved in the Late Carboniferous period ( 330 to 298 @.@ 9 Ma ) . The earliest fossils of the two surviving amniote groups , synapsids and sauropsids , date from around 313 Ma . The synapsid pelycosaurs and their descendants the therapsids are the most common land vertebrates in the best @-@ known Permian ( 298 @.@ 9 to 252 @.@ 17 Ma ) fossil beds . However , at the time these were all in temperate zones at middle latitudes , and there is evidence that hotter , drier environments nearer the Equator were dominated by sauropsids and amphibians . 
 The Permian – Triassic extinction event wiped out almost all land vertebrates , as well as the great majority of other life . During the slow recovery from this catastrophe , estimated to have taken 30 million years , a previously obscure <unk> group became the most abundant and diverse terrestrial vertebrates : a few fossils of <unk> ( " ruling lizard forms " ) have been found in Late Permian rocks , but , by the Middle Triassic , archosaurs were the dominant land vertebrates . Dinosaurs distinguished themselves from other archosaurs in the Late Triassic , and became the dominant land vertebrates of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods ( 201 @.@ 3 to 66 Ma ) . 
 During the Late Jurassic , birds evolved from small , predatory theropod dinosaurs . The first birds inherited teeth and long , bony tails from their dinosaur ancestors , but some had developed horny , toothless beaks by the very Late Jurassic and short pygostyle tails by the Early Cretaceous . 
 While the archosaurs and dinosaurs were becoming more dominant in the Triassic , the <unk> successors of the therapsids evolved into small , mainly nocturnal insectivores . This ecological role may have promoted the evolution of mammals , for example nocturnal life may have accelerated the development of endothermy ( " warm @-@ bloodedness " ) and hair or fur . By 195 Ma in the Early Jurassic there were animals that were very like today 's mammals in a number of respects . Unfortunately , there is a gap in the fossil record throughout the Middle Jurassic . However , fossil teeth discovered in Madagascar indicate that the split between the lineage leading to monotremes and the one leading to other living mammals had occurred by 167 Ma . After dominating land vertebrate niches for about 150 Ma , the dinosaurs perished in the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event ( 66 Ma ) along with many other groups of organisms . Mammals throughout the time of the dinosaurs had been restricted to a narrow range of taxa , sizes and shapes , but increased rapidly in size and diversity after the extinction , with bats taking to the air within 13 million years , and cetaceans to the sea within 15 million years .

 The first flowering plants appeared around 130 Ma . The 250 @,@ 000 to 400 @,@ 000 species of flowering plants outnumber all other ground plants combined , and are the dominant vegetation in most terrestrial ecosystems . There is fossil evidence that flowering plants diversified rapidly in the Early Cretaceous , from 130 to 90 Ma , and that their rise was associated with that of pollinating insects . Among modern flowering plants Magnolia are thought to be close to the common ancestor of the group . However , paleontologists have not succeeded in identifying the earliest stages in the evolution of flowering plants . 
 = = Social insects = = 
 The social insects are remarkable because the great majority of individuals in each colony are sterile . This appears contrary to basic concepts of evolution such as natural selection and the selfish gene . In fact , there are very few eusocial insect species : only 15 out of approximately 2 @,@ 600 living families of insects contain eusocial species , and it seems that eusociality has evolved independently only 12 times among arthropods , although some eusocial lineages have diversified into several families . Nevertheless , social insects have been spectacularly successful ; for example although ants and termites account for only about 2 % of known insect species , they form over 50 % of the total mass of insects . Their ability to control a territory appears to be the foundation of their success . 
 The sacrifice of breeding opportunities by most individuals has long been explained as a consequence of these species ' unusual haplodiploid method of sex determination , which has the paradoxical consequence that two sterile worker daughters of the same queen share more genes with each other than they would with their offspring if they could breed . However , E. O. Wilson and Bert Hölldobler argue that this explanation is faulty : for example , it is based on kin selection , but there is no evidence of nepotism in colonies that have multiple queens . Instead , they write , eusociality evolves only in species that are under strong pressure from predators and competitors , but in environments where it is possible to build " fortresses " ; after colonies have established this security , they gain other advantages through co @-@ operative foraging . In support of this explanation they cite the appearance of eusociality in <unk> mole rats , which are not haplodiploid . 
 The earliest fossils of insects have been found in Early Devonian rocks from about 400 Ma , which preserve only a few varieties of flightless insect . The Mazon Creek lagerstätten from the Late Carboniferous , about 300 Ma , include about 200 species , some gigantic by modern standards , and indicate that insects had occupied their main modern ecological niches as herbivores , detritivores and insectivores . Social termites and ants first appear in the Early Cretaceous , and advanced social bees have been found in Late Cretaceous rocks but did not become abundant until the Middle Cenozoic . 
 = = Humans = = 
 The idea that , along with other life forms , modern @-@ day humans evolved from an ancient , common ancestor was proposed by Robert Chambers in 1844 and taken up by Charles Darwin in 1871 . Modern humans evolved from a lineage of upright @-@ walking apes that has been traced back over 6 Ma to <unk> . The first known stone tools were made about 2 @.@ 5 Ma , apparently by Australopithecus <unk> , and were found near animal bones that bear scratches made by these tools . The earliest <unk> had chimpanzee @-@ sized brains , but there has been a fourfold increase in the last 3 Ma ; a statistical analysis suggests that hominine brain sizes depend almost completely on the date of the fossils , while the species to which they are assigned has only slight influence . There is a long @-@ running debate about whether modern humans evolved all over the world simultaneously from existing advanced <unk> or are descendants of a single small population in Africa , which then migrated all over the world less than 200 @,@ 000 years ago and replaced previous hominine species . There is also debate about whether anatomically modern humans had an intellectual , cultural and technological " Great Leap Forward " under 100 @,@ 000 years ago and , if so , whether this was due to neurological changes that are not visible in fossils . 
 = = Mass extinctions = = 
 Life on Earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since 542 Ma . Although they were disasters at the time , mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on Earth . When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another , it is rarely because the new dominant group is " superior " to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one . 
 The fossil record appears to show that the gaps between mass extinctions are becoming longer and the average and background rates of extinction are decreasing . Both of these phenomena could be explained in one or more ways : 
 The oceans may have become more hospitable to life over the last 500 Ma and less vulnerable to mass extinctions : dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths ; the development of life on land reduced the run @-@ off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events ; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains were less likely to be disrupted . 
 Reasonably complete fossils are very rare , most extinct organisms are represented only by partial fossils , and complete fossils are rarest in the oldest rocks . So paleontologists have mistakenly assigned parts of the same organism to different genera , which were often defined solely to accommodate these finds — the story of Anomalocaris is an example of this . The risk of this mistake is higher for older fossils because these are often unlike parts of any living organism . Many of the " superfluous " genera are represented by fragments which are not found again and the " superfluous " genera appear to become extinct very quickly . 
 Biodiversity in the fossil record , which is " ... the number of distinct genera alive at any given time ; that is , those whose first occurrence predates and whose last occurrence postdates that time " shows a different trend : a fairly swift rise from 542 to 400 Ma ; a slight decline from 400 to 200 Ma , in which the devastating Permian – Triassic extinction event is an important factor ; and a swift rise from 200 Ma to the present .

 = Moonbase 3 = 
 Moonbase 3 is a British science fiction television programme that ran for six episodes in 1973 . It was a co @-@ production between the BBC , 20th Century Fox and the American ABC network . Created by Doctor Who producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks as a realistic alternative strand of TV science @-@ fiction , it was not a commercial or critical success ( Dicks himself has stated in a foreword to a collection of Tom Baker @-@ era Doctor Who scripts that they " overdid the grimness and forgot about the sense of wonder that science fiction is all about " ) . 
 It starred Donald Houston as Director David Caulder , who is appointed to the position after the previous director was killed while returning to Earth . Ralph Bates was Michel Lebrun , the Deputy Director , who was concerned about keeping to the rules . Fiona Gaunt played Doctor Helen Smith , the base 's psychiatrist , and Barry Lowe played Tom Hill , the head of the base technical section . 
 The programme was notable for its combination of realistic spaceflight procedures , ensured by hiring BBC technical adviser James Burke , and its strong character @-@ based writing . Although very dated in terms of its looks and assumptions about the future , it remains well regarded in retrospect . 
 = = Concept and setting = = 
 Moonbase 3 was set in the year 2003 – some 30 years into the future at time of broadcast – and dramatised life in the enclosed environment of the titular moonbase . Five world powers have colonised the Moon : America ( Moonbase 1 , commanded by Bill Jackson ) , Russia ( Moonbase 2 ) , Europe ( Moonbase 3 ) , China ( Moonbase 4 , commanded by General Cheng ) and Brazil ( Moonbase 5 ) . The European Moonbase 3 has been in existence for 8 years at the time the series starts . With oversight provided by the European Space Assembly and the European Aeronautics and Space Administration , Moonbase 3 is a shoestring operation when compared with the Russian and American efforts and much of base director David Caulder 's job is to stave off budget cuts or a complete shutdown in the face of sceptical bureaucrats . 
 Alongside technical problems such as stranded astronauts , explosive decompressions and failed experiments , the inhabitants of the moonbase must also deal with psychological problems arising from the cramped , dangerous environment they live in . In " Departure and Arrival " , a mental breakdown suffered by a shuttle pilot has tragic consequences . " Achilles Heel " and " Outsiders " deal with the fallout from crew members ' difficulty with living up to the standards they have set for themselves . " Behemoth " and " View of a Dead Planet " deal with forms of mass hysteria . 
 = = Principal characters = = 
 Dr David Caulder ( Donald Houston ) 
 Appointed Director of Moonbase 3 following the death of his predecessor , David Caulder is a scientist , academic and administrator . A lecturer at the University of Oxford , he rose to prominence when he was appointed Chancellor of the University during a period of student unrest and managed to calm the situation down , earning him a reputation as a " Welsh wizard " . The Director @-@ General of the European space effort describes Caulder as a " militant liberal , passionately committed to the middle of the road " . Caulder sees himself as a buffer , who deals with the political aspects of running the moonbase , giving the others the room to perform the vital tasks of keeping Moonbase 3 operations going . 
 Dr Michel Lebrun ( Ralph Bates ) 
 Deputy Director Michel Lebrun is noted for his rigid adherence to the rules and procedures , making him a somewhat inflexible individual who has difficulty understanding the human dimension involved when dealing with other base personnel . The Frenchman is slightly resentful of Caulder 's appointment to the position of Director , feeling that he has been overlooked for the job though Helen Smith reminds him that he is , perhaps , too young to take up the position at this time . However , when he is ordered to relieve Caulder of command during the attempted rescue of Tom Hill in the episode " Castor and Pollux " , he remains loyal to Caulder and carries out the rescue as planned despite his misgivings about the risks . 
 Dr Helen Smith ( Fiona Gaunt ) 
 Helen Smith is the base psychologist responsible for preparing regular psychological record reports ( or <unk> ) , assessing the mental state of all personnel . An expert in behavioural studies in an alien environment – her thesis was titled " Human beings adjust " – she acts as a sounding board , enabling individual crew members to adapt to the situation of life on the Moon . However , she develops a trend of engaging in romantic relationships with her most troubled patients as seen in " Achilles Heel " and " Outsiders " . 
 Tom Hill ( Barry Lowe ) 
 Forty @-@ two @-@ year @-@ old Tom Hill is director of operations on the moonbase responsible for flight control and base maintenance . An experienced astronaut , he became a minor celebrity six years before the events of the series take place when he rescued an escaped cat from a <unk> . A down @-@ to @-@ earth no @-@ nonsense type , who dislikes having his work interfered with by management , he generally tries to maintain an informal , casual air , calling all female staff as " love " and calling Lebrun " Mickey boy " , a moniker Lebrun hates . However , unhappy about the way Caulder conducted the investigation of his predecessor 's death in " Departure and Arrival " , Hill initially maintains a strictly businesslike relationship with Caulder before their relationship thaws in later episodes .

 Terrance Dicks and Barry Letts had been working together , as script editor and producer respectively , on Doctor Who since 1970 . Dicks had begun his television writing career on The Avengers and Crossroads before joining Doctor Who as its script editor in 1968 . Former actor Barry Letts had changed career into television direction in 1967 and had worked on series such as Z @-@ Cars and The Newcomers before being asked to take over as producer of Doctor Who in 1970 , where he first met Dicks . In 1972 , looking to move on from Doctor Who , the pair started considering a number of ideas for other shows they could collaborate on . Their first idea arose from the successful collaboration they had with the Royal Navy on the Doctor Who serial The Sea Devils which led to them considering pitching a serial set on a frigate only to find they were too late – the BBC had just commissioned a series , Warship , with that very premise . In late 1972 , they developed the concept of Moonbase 3 , as an anthology series set on a lunar colony that would " provide intelligent , realistic drama rather than Science Fantasy " , and submitted a pilot script , titled " Departure and Arrival " , to Shaun Sutton , the Head of Drama at the BBC . The series was formally commissioned in December 1972 and would be made , as a co @-@ production between the BBC and 20th Century Fox and the ABC network in America , during the break in production between Seasons 10 and 11 of Doctor Who . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 The first Moonbase 3 script to be formally commissioned was " View of a Dead Planet " on 15 December 1972 . This was written by Arden Winch , a respected writer who had written for The Wednesday Play . Two scripts , " Behemoth " and " Outsiders " , were commissioned from John <unk> , who had written for Colditz and Special Branch . The final two scripts , " The Dark Side of the Moon " and " The Gentle Rain " ( later renamed " Castor and Pollux " and " Achilles Heel " respectively ) , were commissioned from John <unk> , a prolific writer whose credits included The Avengers , Doctor Who and The Troubleshooters . Lastly , Letts and Dicks retrospectively commissioned themselves in late May 1973 for their pilot script " Departure and Arrival " . 
 In order to achieve a high level of realism , Letts and Dicks hired a technical advisor , James Burke , a science correspondent who was well known to television viewers thanks to his work as anchorman on the television coverage of the Apollo moon landings and for presenting science series such as Tomorrow 's World and The Burke Special . Burke decided that 2003 would be a realistic date for bases to have been established on the Moon , telling the Radio Times that " Men won 't go back to the Moon until the 1990s . Neither the Russians nor the Americans have any plans at present and no @-@ one else can afford it . [ ... ] As for the base itself – it should look exactly as it would if they built one tomorrow . [ ... ] They 'd be small , supporting 30 or 40 men and running on a shoestring . [ ... ] It 'll be like life on a nuclear submarine " . 
 Cast as David Caulder was Donald Houston , an experienced character actor , who had appeared in 633 Squadron , The Longest Day and The Sea Wolves , and was known for playing authority figures . Ralph Bates , who was cast as Michel Lebrun , had first made a name for himself playing the Emperor Caligula in the Granada Television series The Caesars but was best known as a regular actor in the Hammer horror stable . Fiona Gaunt , playing Helen Smith , had been in a television adaptation of War and Peace while Barry Lowe , playing Tom Hill , had been a regular on the police drama Z @-@ Cars . 
 Two directors were assigned to the series – Ken Hannam and Christopher Barry . Hannam had previously directed such series as Colditz and Paul Temple while Barry had worked extensively on Doctor Who , having directed some 31 episodes at the time , including the stories The Dæmons and The Mutants for Letts and Dicks , as well as episodes of Out of the Unknown , Paul Temple and The <unk> Line . Hannam and Barry alternated directing the episodes between them with filming on Moonbase 3 beginning on 24 April 1973 at the BBC film studios in Ealing . The Ealing filming mainly centred around the scenes set on the lunar surface which proved a difficult experience for the actors . Star Donald Houston told the Radio Times that the spacesuits got " hot and claustrophobic . In the end they had to have oxygen standing by . [ ... ] the dust rose in clouds and the cameramen all wore surgical masks . The actors just choked " . Recalling his guest appearance on Moonbase 3 , in the episode " Behemoth " , Peter Miles told TV Zone in 1991 that he was " asked to be like a gazelle and leap as I came down the hillock in full astronaut gear . [ ... ] The tech crew wondered why I was steaming up furiously in my astronaut 's head . They 'd forgotten to put air holes into the helmet . [ ... ] I said , ' Help help ! Help help ! I 'm not breathing folks ! ' They took the helmet off before drilling the holes or I wouldn 't be here now " . Filming continued at Ealing until 30 May 1973 before production moved to BBC Television Centre for the remaining scenes , mostly those set inside the moonbase , which would be recorded on videotape beginning on 18 June 1973 . The episodes were recorded in a different order than that in which they were broadcast with " Departure and Arrival " recorded first followed by " Castor and Pollux " , " Behemoth " , " View of a Dead Planet " , " Outsiders " and , lastly , " Achilles Heel " with recording wrapping on 15 August 1973 . Music was provided by Dudley Simpson who , at this time , was the regular composer on Doctor Who . Simpson composed the main title theme that accompanied the opening and closing credits as well as approximately 60 minutes of incidental music .

 Moonbase 3 was promoted by the Radio Times on the week of broadcast with a two @-@ page article by Mike <unk> , titled " The Facts of Life on the Moon " , that interviewed James Burke about his ideas of life on the moon and also spoke to star Donald Houston , dresser Leslie Hallam and costume designer Dee Kelly about their experiences making the show . Broadcast on Sunday nights at 7 : 25pm on BBC One , audience reaction to the series was disappointing with the debut episode garnering under 6 million viewers and ratings slipping as low as 2 million in subsequent weeks before stabilising at 4 million . A BBC Audience Research report slated the series as " banal , predictable and slow " . Reviewing " Departure and Arrival " in The Observer , Clive James described the plot as " the Yangtze Incident plus liquid oxygen " .

 As was normal procedure at the BBC at the time , the original PAL master tapes of the series were wiped some time after broadcast and , for many years , Moonbase 3 was believed to be lost forever . However , in 1993 , NTSC copies of all six episodes were found in co @-@ producer Fox 's archives and returned to the BBC . The series was subsequently released on VHS videotape over three volumes in 1994 by BBC Video and on DVD in 2002 by Second Sight .

 Terrance Dicks has felt that Moonbase 3 was ultimately a failure : " The trouble was we built a too restrictive format for ourselves " and that the series " lacked a sense of wonder and outrageousness " . Academic Peter Wright has said about Moonbase 3 that its " appeal to realism resulted in a disquieting sense of claustrophobia and isolation that undermined the optimism of its premise and captured the general mood of insularity felt ( and often desired ) in Britain in the early 1970s " . Moonbase 3 , although not directly influential , can be seen as an antecedent of similar realistic , near @-@ future , British space series such as Star Cops and Space Island One .

 = Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge = 
 The Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge , which stood from 1855 to 1897 across the Niagara River , was the world 's first working railway suspension bridge . It spanned 825 feet ( 251 m ) and stood 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) downstream of Niagara Falls , where it connected Niagara Falls , Ontario , to Niagara Falls , New York . Trains used the upper of its two decks , pedestrians and carriages the lower . The brainchild of Canadian politicians , the bridge was built by one American and one Canadian company . It was most commonly called the Suspension Bridge ; other names included Niagara Railway Suspension Bridge , Niagara Suspension Bridge , and its official American name , the International Suspension Bridge . 
 The bridge was part of Canadian politician William Hamilton Merritt 's vision to promote trade within his country and with its neighbor the United States . Many , including bridge builders , argued that a suspension bridge could not allow the safe passage of trains . Nonetheless , the bridge companies hired Charles Ellet , Jr . , who laid a line by a kite across the 800 @-@ foot ( 240 m ) chasm and built a temporary suspension bridge in 1848 . Ellet left the project after a financial dispute with the bridge companies , who hired John Augustus Roebling to complete the project . By 1854 , his bridge was nearly complete , and the lower deck was opened for pedestrian and carriage travel . On March 18 , 1855 , a fully laden passenger train officially opened the completed bridge . 
 A border crossing between Canada and the United States , the Suspension Bridge played significant roles in the histories of the Niagara region and the two countries . Three railway lines crossed over the bridge , connecting cities on both sides of the border . The Great Western Railway , New York Central Railroad , and New York and Erie Rail Road differed in the track gauge ; the bridge used a triple gauge system to conserve space , overlapping two tracks on top of each other and using a rail of each to form the third track . The railroads brought a large influx of trade and tourists into the region around the Niagara Falls . In the time leading to the American Civil War , the Underground Railroad helped slaves in the United States escape across the Suspension Bridge to freedom in Canada . After the war , the bridge became a symbol of inspiration to Americans , encouraging them to rebuild their country and pushing them to quickly industrialize their nation . 
 The bridge 's success proved that a railway suspension bridge could be safe and operational . Slowly decaying , the bridge 's wooden structures were replaced with stronger steel and iron versions by 1886 . Heavier trains required its replacement by the Steel Arch Bridge , later renamed the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge , on August 27 , 1897 . 
 = = Conception and construction = = 
 In the mid @-@ 19th century , the hinterlands of the North American East Coast opened up rapidly . In Canada , entrepreneur and politician William Hamilton Merritt helped establish several trade routes , especially in dredged waterways between the lake cities . He also envisioned a U.S. and Canadian rail network to connect the Atlantic coast with new territories in the West , and this led to a railway suspension bridge across the Niagara River below the falls . 
 Merritt 's vision for the Niagara Suspension Bridge was conceived at the Niagara River itself . In summer 1844 while taking a picnic on the river shores , near what was then the town of Clifton , Merritt read a letter from his sons to his wife . The younger <unk> were touring Europe and visited the town of Fribourg , Switzerland . Amazed by the Freiburg Suspension Bridge , they wrote to their parents , describing the wonders of the bridge in eloquent terms . Their writing had a profound effect on their parents , and the elder <unk> wondered if such a suspension bridge could be built across the Niagara . Merritt was driven to realize that vision , and he approached the relevant authorities , including the Queen of England , for permission to start the construction of the suspension bridge . His efforts were rewarded in 1846 ; the state of New York and the government of Canada approved the charters to form the Niagara Falls International Bridge Company and the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge Company , respectively . 
 In the years before the first bridge was built over the Niagara River , the river was crossed entirely by boats . Powered by steam engines , vessels ferried people and carriages across the raging river at calmer points of the water . One of these vessels was the Maid of the Mist , the first tourist boat to ply the waters of the Niagara River . Named after a local legend , the steamer began service in 1846 . Launching from a point 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) below the Horseshoe Falls , it <unk> up to the base of the falls , offering a close @-@ up view of the natural wonder to its passengers , before moving to the opposite shore . The site for the Suspension Bridge was half a mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) from the Maid of the Mist 's landings . The selection of the bridge site was based more on aesthetics than technical ease ; it was the narrowest point of the gorge — 800 feet ( 240 m ) across and 230 feet ( 70 m ) deep — that allowed a full view of the falls from the American side . 
 After the bridge companies were founded , they invited engineers to submit plans and cost estimates for a suspension bridge that carried a railway . The invitation was met with skepticism among the engineering community . At that time , there was not a suspension bridge that could allow a train to pass over it safely . While the Europeans were erecting suspension bridges by the hundreds , the Americans mostly ignored them out of safety concerns ; in 1831 Sir Samuel Brown 's Broughton Suspension Bridge in Britain had collapsed under the marching feet of a troop of soldiers , sending those on its deck into the River Irwell . Furthermore , many American bridges had collapsed without experiencing weight and pressure equivalent to railroad traffic , and American engineers feared that any railway bridge would likely fail — especially a suspension bridge . 
 Four engineers responded : Edward Serrell , Samuel Keefer , Charles Ellet , Jr . , and John Augustus Roebling . All submitted designs for a suspension bridge . At the time of the bidding , Ellet and Roebling were acknowledged as masters of suspension bridge building in America . Roebling submitted two designs , a conservative single @-@ deck suspension bridge and a double @-@ decked version , both with meticulous calculations and drawings . Instead of relying solely on submissions , Charles Ellet , Jr. took a proactive approach . When he got wind of the project in 1845 , he wrote to Charles B. Stuart , chief engineer of the Great Western Railway , boldly proclaiming that he could build a bridge for any likely purpose across the Niagara . After the charters had been obtained , Ellet helped Stuart to sell the bridge companies ' stock and offered to buy US $ 30 @,@ 000 worth of stock himself . His efforts earned him the $ 190 @,@ 000 bridge contract on November 9 , 1847 .

 While growing up on a farm in Pennsylvania , Charles Ellet , Jr. scraped through odd jobs , but saved enough money to finance an education at the École nationale des Ponts et <unk> in France . After attending four months of lectures , he toured Europe before returning to the United States as the only native @-@ born American with European education in engineering . Ellet announced his ambitions to build suspension bridges in his country of birth by proposing to span the Potomac River with one . His proposal was ignored ; few were willing to heed a young , inexperienced and impetuous engineer . To gain experience , Ellet started to work on railroads and canals , and later became the chief engineer on the James River and Kanawha Canal project . He further improved his reputation by contributing articles about suspension bridges to respected engineering journals , such as American Railroad Journal ; eventually , Ellet built his first suspension bridge over the Schuylkill River , Pennsylvania , in 1842 . 
 Ellet had the looks of an actor , which were complemented by his entertaining oratorical skills . He took advantage of these characteristics , and used showmanship and dramatics to market his proposals . These skills helped to win him attention and raise his profile both in the public and within the industry . However , his imperiousness also ruffled the feathers of people , which caused conflicts . Nonetheless , his capability to promote himself had won him the contracts for the Suspension Bridge and the later Wheeling Suspension Bridge ; the Wheeling contract was won in July 1847 while Ellet 's plan for the Niagara Suspension Bridge was still in its initial stages of construction . Ellet 's initial design for the bridge at Niagara placed all forms of transportation on a single deck . The railway track was in the middle of the deck , sandwiched between carriageways and footpaths on the outer sides . Moreover , trains would not go over the bridge ; their cars would be disconnected from the heavy locomotives and pulled across the bridge by horses , cables , or lighter 6 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 5 @.@ 4 t ) engines . Before the work could begin , Ellet faced the problem of all suspension bridge construction : getting a line across the gap . 
 Ellet 's brainstorming sessions with his men raised several ideas that could enable a line to be suspended across the gorge ; these included firing cannonballs with the line attached , towing it across the river with a steamer , and tying it to a rocket that would then be launched across the gorge . Ultimately the bridge engineer chose an idea inspired by Benjamin Franklin 's experiment with a kite . It was similar to 15th century inventor Leonardo da Vinci 's plan to span a gap . Ellet also took the opportunity to generate publicity for his project . Organizing a kite @-@ flying contest , he offered $ 5 to any boy who flew a kite across the gorge and secured the kite string to the other side . Youths from nearby towns flocked in to participate . Unlike the other boys who flew their kites from the United States side of the gorge , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Homan Walsh crossed the river by a ferry upstream and walked to the Canadian side of the bridge site to launch his kite . He almost succeeded on his first attempt ; his kite flew across but crashed just short of the shore . After resting several days at a friend 's house , Walsh finally got his kite across the gorge and secured its line to a tree . 
 Charles Ellet and his team tied a heavier line to the kite string and pulled the joined lines across . They pulled successive heavier and stronger lines across until the final bridge cable — 7 ⁄ 8 inch ( 2 @.@ 2 cm ) thick — was hanging across the gorge . The cable was suspended between two wooden towers 40 feet ( 12 m ) tall , and it was attached to an iron basket . Ellet planned to use this system as a basket ferry to shuttle workers and materials across the gorge , saving time that would otherwise have been spent on land and ferry travel . Through media coverage and word @-@ of @-@ mouth , many people knew of Ellet 's efforts and flocked to the site to watch the construction . On March 13 , 1848 , the system was completed , and the team planned to test it by pulling the empty basket across . They hit a snag when the basket kept getting stuck halfway and could not move ahead . Pulling back the basket , Ellet decided to assure the watching crowd that the system was workable . He stepped into the basket , and it moved towards the opposite shore . When Ellet reached the problematic spot , he spotted the issue ; the basket 's rollers could not pass over a portion of the cable that had been accidentally flattened during the construction . He fixed the problem and proceeded to cross to the Canadian side and back , becoming the first person to cross the gorge . Although the bridge companies had prohibited Ellet from collecting tolls , he charged each person $ 1 @.@ 00 for the chance to " observe first hand the engineering wonder of bridging the Niagara " . On some days , the basket ferry conveyed up to 125 people across the gorge . 
 Continuing his construction , Ellet built two footbridges and joined them together to form an 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) wide suspension bridge . He intended to use this temporary bridge as a scaffold for the construction of the permanent railway bridge . On July 29 , 1848 , the bridge builder inaugurated the span in his typical manner ; standing in his horse @-@ buggy like a gladiator in his chariot , Ellet sped across the bridge , which had railings for only a third of its length at that time . His stunt garnered further publicity for the bridge , and the toll collected from the span proved lucrative ; $ 5 @,@ 000 was collected in less than a year since its official opening on August 1 , 1848 . Disputes arose between the bridge companies and Ellet over their shares of the money , and their relations turned bitter . The companies charged that Ellet was late in his schedule and withheld payment . Ellet retaliated by mounting cannons at the bridge to claim ownership over it . In the end the matter went to court . The bridge companies paid $ 10 @,@ 000 to Charles Ellet , and he left the project to work full @-@ time on the Wheeling Suspension Bridge . 
 The Niagara Suspension Bridge project was in hiatus for three years before the bridge companies engaged another renowned civil engineer , John Augustus Roebling , to complete it . The delay caused Roebling to miss out on the honor of building the first permanent bridge to span the Niagara ; Serrell completed the Lewiston Suspension Bridge in 1851 . Roebling would , however , achieve other honors in building his Niagara Railway Suspension Bridge .

He attended two semesters of lessons at Berlin 's <unk> and worked for the Prussian government , constructing military roads . Tired of the bureaucracy , he resigned his position and left for the United States in 1830 , arriving with his brother in Philadelphia on August 6 , 1831 . Instead of continuing an engineering profession , he took up farming for a living . After five years he married a tailor 's daughter , and had eight children with her over the next decade . Agrarian work was unsatisfactory to John Roebling , and in 1837 , after the death of his brother and the birth of his first child , he returned to engineering . 
 Roebling first signed on as a surveyor for the Beaver River canal system , launching his career with a string of canal and railroad projects . Aside from writing articles in engineering journals , Roebling designed his own wire cables and started his own company to manufacture them ; the John A. Roebling Company was the first wire rope manufacturer in the United States . Gradually gaining fame for his civil engineering , Roebling finally got to build suspension bridges . His first bridge was the Allegheny Suspension Aqueduct in Pittsburgh . The structure , completed in 1845 , was the first suspension aqueduct in the world and the first large American suspension bridge that had multiple spans . Furthermore , it was the first suspension structure built with modern cable spinning techniques — Roebling 's own invention . Earlier bridge building techniques involved fabricating the main cables at a factory , transporting them to the bridge site , and then stretching the heavy cables over the gap to erect them over the bridge . Roebling , during his experiments with wire ropes , conceived and patented a new construction method for these main cables . A long line — the traveler rope — formed a loop around two horizontal wheels , one on each side of the gorge . A lightweight wheel , " the traveling wheel " , was attached to this line , and a wire threaded around this wheel . Like a belt in a mechanical system , the traveler rope and its wheel moved across the gap as the horizontal wheels turned , pulling the wire along . The traveling wheel effectively hauled two lengths of the same wire ( running above and under the traveling wheel ) across the gap at a time . The lengths of wire were collected and bound at intervals to form thicker strands , which were later compressed together into the main <unk> which supported themselves and later the proportional weight of the bridge as they were formed . The method became the standard for suspension bridge construction , and remained unchanged for many years . In the 20th century , suspension bridges were still built with this pulley winding system , albeit with more sophisticated equipment . 
 John Roebling was a contrasting character to Charles Ellet . Whereas Ellet embellished his proposals with fanciful words and deeds , Roebling presented papers filled with meticulous calculations and drawings . The elder engineer was stern and driven to achieve , taking a scientific approach to all interests . Rarely did he show emotions in his dealings , even to his closest associates . The man , however , dared to confront his detractors and make bold <unk> about his work . He openly called European suspension bridges — including American suspension bridges built with European techniques — weak , and occasionally sniped at Ellet 's and Stephenson 's works . He announced that his Brooklyn Bridge , when completed , " will not only be the greatest bridge in existence , but it will be the greatest engineering work of this continent , and of the age . " Roebling 's history with Ellet started before the bidding for the Niagara Suspension Bridge , early in their careers . During the bidding for the Schuylkill Suspension Bridge project , Ellet had written a proposal that was published in the American Railroad Journal . Mistakenly believing Ellet had won the contract , Roebling wrote to offer his congratulations and requested to be Ellet 's assistant . He received a formal reply without any reference to his request , and his subsequent letter was ignored . When Roebling learned that a contractor had won the bid , he successfully applied to be the contractor 's chief engineer . Ellet , however , persisted with his tactics and snatched the project away from the contractor ; he promoted himself to the bridge company and offered to accept land instead of cash as payment . From then on , Ellet and Roebling became rivals , vying with each other for suspension bridge projects in North America . Roebling learned from their rivalry . His losses to Ellet showed him that he needed to promote himself and gain backers to effectively secure the contracts he desired . 
 When Roebling was called to the Niagara Suspension Bridge project in 1851 , he had six suspension structures to his name . He found Ellet 's final plan to be impractical ; the bridge would have been too heavy and expensive . Roebling had another design in mind : the double @-@ deck bridge he had proposed earlier during the bidding . The lower deck , level with the edge of the chasm , would convey passengers and carriages , and the upper deck , 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) above , would allow fully laden trains to continue their journeys non @-@ stop , albeit at a speed of 5 miles per hour ( 8 @.@ 0 km / h ) . Roebling reasoned that the decks and sufficient trusses would form a rigid tube , making the bridge stiffer than a normal suspension bridge . The theory was similar to that of the tubular bridge but implemented at a lower cost . The engineering community was critical of Roebling 's project . Robert Stephenson , builder of the tubular Britannia Bridge , was among those short @-@ listed to complete the Niagara Suspension Bridge before Roebling 's selection . Stephenson had submitted a design for a tubular bridge , and in 1859 he built a large and expensive tubular bridge for the Grand Trunk Railway at Montreal , Quebec . The bridge builder then said in derision of Roebling 's suspension railway , " If your bridge succeeds , mine is a magnificent blunder . " 
 In the face of criticism , Roebling completed the project in four years , using Ellet 's bridge as scaffolding . The railway deck was stress @-@ tested by the crossing of the 23 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 21 t ) steam engine London at a speed of 8 miles per hour ( 13 km / h ) on March 8 , 1855 . Ten days later the upper deck of the bridge was officially opened ; the lower deck had been opened to the public a year earlier . As the first commercial passenger train trundled over the bridge , the two countries were finally connected by railroad across the Niagara River . The successful crossings of these and later trains made Roebling 's Suspension Bridge the first working suspension railway bridge in history .

 Roebling 's bridge was supported by two limestone towers on each side of the gorge . These Egyptian @-@ style towers stood 88 feet ( 27 m ) tall on the American shore and 78 feet ( 24 m ) tall on the Canadian shore . With their foundations 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) in the earth , the limestone structures could support up to 12 million pounds ( 5 @.@ 4 million kg ) . Four 10 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 27 cm ) thick main cables held up the bridge ; two cables ran through iron saddles at the top of each tower . Each cable comprised 3 @,@ 059 wires that were spun with Roebling 's patented technique used in his Allegheny Suspension Aqueduct . The ends of each cable were secured to 6 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 56 m2 ) cast @-@ iron plates sunk 20 – 30 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 – 9 @.@ 1 m ) deep in the bedrock . Support lines hung down from iron clamps that encircled the main cables , and held up the decks . Deep trusses — never before seen on a large suspension bridge — lined the sides of the bridge , and joined the two decks so that the structure looked like a cage . The trussed sides and the upper and lower decks , which spanned 825 feet ( 251 m ) , formed a " hollow straight beam " , reinforcing the rigidity of the bridge . 
 The Suspension Bridge was further stiffened by guy @-@ wires which ran from its upper deck to the top of its towers . Criticism of suspension bridges was growing after the Wheeling Suspension Bridge collapsed under strong winds in 1854 . To address these concerns , Roebling added more guy @-@ wires to secure the lower deck to the shores below . Roebling 's efforts ensured that his Suspension Bridge remained standing while other suspension bridges across the Niagara River collapsed because of strong winds . Although he was not the first engineer to appreciate the need for a suspension bridge to be sufficiently rigid or to implement the methods to do so , Roebling was the first to understand the principles behind the methods and combine them in the building of a suspension bridge . Roebling proved that despite popular opinion , properly built suspension bridges can safely support the passage of heavy railway traffic . The engineer 's combination of stiffening methods created the first modern suspension bridge . Such was the rigidity of the Suspension Bridge that it withstood the shockwave caused by the nearby fall of a 5 @,@ 000 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 4 @,@ 500 t ) mass of rock in 1863 ; the force of the impact manifested itself as a wave , rippling through the decks of the bridge from the American side to the Canadian side and back . 
 From the United States , the New York and Erie Rail Road 's Canandaigua and Niagara Falls Railroad and New York Central Railroad 's Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad crossed over the bridge and reached into Ontario . Similarly , the Great Western Railway in Canada extended its network from Canada into New York . At the time of the bridge 's opening , the three railroads were of different gauges : 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) standard gauge on the New York Central , 5 ft 6 in ( 1 @,@ 676 mm ) on the Great Western , and 6 ft ( 1 @,@ 829 mm ) on the Erie . Instead of accommodating three railways side @-@ by @-@ side on a single wide deck , the bridge saved space by overlapping the tracks over each other . This method used only four rails ; one pair formed the track for one railway , and the other pair formed another . One rail from each pair would then form the final track . In the first year of the bridge 's operation , an average of 30 trains trundled across it each day . Five years later , 45 trains passed over the structure daily . 
 Roebling mandated that the trains be limited to a maximum speed of 5 miles per hour ( 8 @.@ 0 km / h ) to ensure absolute safety . He was confident the bridge could handle faster train traffic , but he preferred a safe operation . In his tests the bridge supported a 326 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 296 t ) train , bending 10 @.@ 5 inches ( 27 cm ) under the weight . This was within the maximum load of 450 short tons ( 410 t ) specified in the design of the bridge . The figure was a conservative estimate . The cables and guy @-@ wires could support 7 @,@ 300 short tons ( 6 @,@ 600 t ) , and travel journalist Alfred J. <unk> commented that it was normal to see 1 @,@ 200 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 1 @,@ 100 t ) trains pass over the bridge without danger . The bridge shook whenever a train trundled over it , although this had no effect on its integrity . When the frequency of passing trains was high , the trembling was noticeable to travelers on the lower deck and proved uncomfortable to some ; writer Mark Twain noted , " You drive over to Suspension Bridge and divide your misery between the chances of smashing down two hundred feet into the river below , and the chances of having a railway @-@ train overhead smashing down onto you . Either possibility is discomforting taken by itself , but , mixed together , they amount in the aggregate to positive unhappiness . " Despite such commentaries , thousands of people crossed over the bridge safely every day . 
 American engineers regard the Suspension Bridge as a major achievement of efficiency . In a fledgling country where resources — material and financial — were limited , they had to make do with whatever was available . This goal was espoused by the American Society of Civil Engineers , which opined , " That is the best engineering , not which makes the most splendid , or even the most perfect work , but that which makes a work that answers the purpose well , at the least cost . " Roebling had built a bridge that rivaled grander bridges of leading European nations at a much lower cost . His Suspension Bridge used only one @-@ sixth the material of Stephenson 's Brittania Bridge , but was twice as long and had a capacity that exceeded the tubular bridge . Moreover , the expenditure on Roebling 's Suspension Bridge was $ 400 @,@ 000 , whereas a tubular bridge of equivalent length and load @-@ bearing capability would have cost $ 4 million . Roebling 's success established him as the master of suspension bridges . The inclined guy @-@ wires that stretched from the top of towers to the roadway of the Suspension Bridge became the signature of his future works . 
 Although the Suspension Bridge proved that the suspension system could be safely used to carry railroads , no more suspension railway bridges were built . The outbreak of the American Civil War diverted attention from such civil engineering ventures , and by the time attention was paid to building bridges again , cantilever bridges were in vogue for railway bridges . Regardless , the Suspension Bridge 's success made it a model for suspension railway bridges . When the city of Quebec called for a structure to span the St. Lawrence River in 1850 , it looked to the Suspension Bridge for inspiration . Seventeen years later , the British journal Engineering called for a suspension railway to bridge the Straits of Messina and also referred to Roebling 's bridge . Lastly , Stuart opened his 1871 work on the history of American engineering , Lives and Works of Civil and Military Engineering in America , with an illustration of the bridge .

 As a border crossing between two large growing countries , the Suspension Bridge had throngs of travelers passing over it . Furthermore , it was the intersection of three major railroads . Coupled with its vicinity to a natural wonder , the Niagara Falls , the bridge brought a lot of railroad traffic into the region once it was opened . The towns at the ends of the bridge benefited greatly from this heavy movement of people and goods . The village of Suspension Bridge , United States , grew quickly within a few years after the opening of the bridge , acquiring shops , factories , and a hotel . Its tourism and commerce soon rivaled the town of Niagara Falls , New York ; eventually , the village was merged into the town in 1892 . Similarly , Clifton on the Canadian end of the bridge was integrated into the town of Niagara Falls , Ontario . The two Niagara Falls cities boasted commerce that surpassed neighboring settlements . Around the time of its official opening , the bridge was one of the busiest points of trade on the United States – Canadian border , carrying $ 12 million of transitory goods and $ 2 million of bonded materials into Canada . To handle the large amount of goods exchanged over the border , the Lewiston customs house — the primary customs for the Niagara region — was relocated to the Niagara Suspension Bridge in 1863 . 
 The bridge 's depiction as an engineering marvel and beautiful sight lured many visitors to the Falls . Travelers could , while crossing the bridge , enjoy a view of the Falls enhanced by the sensation of standing 250 feet ( 76 m ) in the air . The Falls , however , proved distant and indistinct to some when there was overcast weather . On the whole , the Suspension Bridge was considered as an attraction that must be seen by visitors to Niagara Falls . In paintings and prints of the bridge , the Suspension Bridge became the focus , pushing the Falls into the background . Unlike paintings of the Falls that capture the viewer 's eye with their majestic views of the natural wonder , pictures of the bridge impressed viewers with the utilitarian design of the structure . By 1897 , the inbound trains to Niagara Falls brought 276 @,@ 900 visitors during the months of May to August . A streetcar system was established in 1882 to handle the increasing cross @-@ border pedestrian traffic . Initially pulled by horses , the trolleys were converted to run on electricity in 1892 . The Suspension Bridge was the pride and symbol of the Great Western Railway , which touted it as the " only Route via Niagara Falls & Suspension Bridge " . 
 Travelers on the Suspension Bridge witnessed several death @-@ defying stunts performed across the Niagara Gorge . On June 30 , 1859 , they saw Charles Blondin 's feat of becoming the first man to cross the chasm on a tightrope . In mid @-@ crossing Blondin sat down on the rope and lowered a line to retrieve a drink from the deck of the Maid of the Mist below . In his later tightrope acts at the same spot , the acrobat would perform a different stunt on each occasion . One time he cooked and ate an omelette in mid @-@ crossing ; another time he carried his manager Harry Colcord on his back . While giving Colcord a piggyback ride , Blondin stopped five times on the tightrope to rest and recover his strength ; each time Colcord gingerly got off Blondin 's back and stood on the tightrope , climbing back on after the acrobat had enough rest . Blondin 's success inspired other acrobats , such as William Leonard Hunt ( " The Great Farini " ) , Samuel Dixon , Clifford <unk> , and Signorina Maria <unk> , to emulate and try to surpass his acts at the same spot . The Signorina , the only woman to walk across the Niagara on a tightrope , once crossed while blindfolded and another time with her hands and legs in manacles . 
 Another group of people in America had their own risky crossings over the Niagara Gorge as they fled over the border into Canada . They were enslaved African @-@ Americans who sought freedom by escaping to a country that declared the liberation of any slave who entered it . The bridge was part of the Underground Railroad , a network of routes designed to smuggle slaves in the United States to freedom in Canada . Before the American Civil War , fleeing slaves had only four main routes into Canada , of which one was crossing the Niagara River . Slaves who escaped along the Niagara route had help from several quarters . The state of New York generally favored granting freedom to slaves ; this attitude emboldened African @-@ American workers in Niagara , who frequently helped slaves flee to Canada . Before the Suspension Bridge was completed , fugitives either crossed the raging river on a boat or risked their lives by swimming at calmer points of the river . The Suspension Bridge made escape across the river easier and safer , although there was still risk . To avoid getting caught and sent back to their owners , slaves had to sneak across on foot or hide aboard trains and oxcarts . Antislavery activist Harriet Tubman guided fugitives at night and bribed custom officials to turn a blind eye . As a result , many slaves crossed the Suspension Bridge to freedom before the United States was engulfed in civil war . 
 When the war ended and the United States turned its focus toward rebuilding , Roebling started building his Brooklyn Bridge . As the monumental task could affect naval navigation , it required state approval , and the government wanted a thorough review of the engineer 's credentials ; hence , a Bridge Party was organized . Comprising Roebling and his son , as well as their fellow bridge engineers , generals , businessmen , and high society figures , the party toured the country to review four bridges Roebling had built before the civil war . The final item on their itinerary was Roebling 's Niagara Suspension Bridge . At the dinner to commemorate the end of the bridge tour , civil war veteran General Henry Warner Slocum gave a toast and called the Suspension Bridge a symbol of inspiration for the United States in its rebuilding efforts . This sentiment was shared by the guests and was expressed at later dinners across the United States . The achievement of building a large suspension bridge over a gorge in the face of overwhelming adversity — constant put @-@ downs by the professional community , American and European — gave the United States a sense of pride . Nationalism rose as the country lauded the bridge . The completion of the bridge that had been deemed impossible by the Western world gave Americans , who had lesser technical accomplishments than Europe at that time , a trophy that stood above any other . The Suspension Bridge became the American symbol to brave the toughest of challenges and do the impossible , pushing their drive for industrialization even harder . Charles W. Woodman specifically drew attention to the Suspension Bridge in his 1865 address to the United States Senate for approval to build a rail system to transport a ship out of the water and up around the Niagara Falls . 
 = = Maintenance and replacement = = 
 Budget concerns forced Roebling to build the Suspension Bridge primarily with wood ; the cost of casting the components out of iron and transporting them " [ way ] out West " was exorbitant . The organic material decayed and rotted because of the moisture present around Niagara Falls . As the industrialization of the United States moved forward rapidly , the introduction of the Bessemer process greatly lowered the cost of the more durable steel and iron . By 1880 , the Suspension Bridge 's wooden trusses , beams , and flooring were replaced with steel . The wire cables were not replaced ; their cores were still in pristine condition . The outer layer of wires in the cables was , however , lightly corroded and had to be replaced . Due to severe deterioration , the limestone towers were replaced in 1886 with steel framed versions . These renovations increased the bridge 's strength and helped it handle heavier loads for a few more years . 
 The weight of trains in North America had greatly increased by the mid @-@ 1890s . Larger and more powerful locomotives were required to pull cars that handled an increasing number of passengers and goods ; compared to the 23 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 21 t ) locomotives crossing the bridge in the 1850s , 170 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 150 t ) locomotives were the common engines 40 years later . The weight of these trains exceeded the specifications of the Suspension Bridge , and the bridge companies took the opportunity to review and request the replacement of the bridge . Civil engineer <unk> L. Buck , who had been hired to maintain the Suspension Bridge , was selected to design the replacement bridge . He settled for a bridge of the arch design . At that time , arch bridges were the new models for railway bridges and were more cost @-@ efficient than suspension bridges . Buck built the new bridge around and below the Suspension Bridge , replacing it a piece at a time . His plan allowed bridge traffic — train and pedestrian — to continue without disruption . By August 27 , 1897 , the last pieces of the Suspension Bridge were dismantled , leaving the Lower Steel Arch Bridge — later renamed the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge — in its stead . On inspection , the cores of the cables that formerly held up the Suspension Bridge were found to be as sound as on the day the bridge was built .

 U @-@ 21 was just over 127 feet ( 39 m ) long and was armed with two bow torpedo tubes , a deck gun , and a machine gun . Construction on U @-@ 21 began in mid 1915 and the boat was launched in September 1916 . After suffering damage during a diving trial in January 1917 , U @-@ 21 underwent seven months of repairs before her commissioning in August 1917 . 
 The U @-@ boat conducted patrols off the Albanian coast in October 1917 , but experienced the failure of the seal on her main hatch . The repairs kept the boat out of action until June 1918 . But in July a piston in her diesel engine broke , knocking the submarine out of the rest of the war . At the end of World War I , U @-@ 21 was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920 . U @-@ 21 had no wartime successes .

 When it became apparent to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy that the First World War would not be a short one , they moved to bolster their U @-@ boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish Havmanden class submarines , three of which had been built at Whitehead & Co. in Fiume . Although the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design , which was largely obsolete , it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for U @-@ 21 and her three sister boats on 27 March 1915 . 
 U @-@ 21 was one of two boats of the class to be built at the Pola Navy Yard . Due to demands by the Hungarian government , subcontracts for the class were divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms , and this politically expedient solution worsened technical problems with the design , resulting in numerous modifications and delays for the class in general . 
 U @-@ 21 was an ocean @-@ going submarine that displaced 173 metric tons ( 170 long tons ) surfaced and 210 metric tons ( 207 long tons ) submerged and was designed for a complement of 18 . She was 127 feet 2 inches ( 38 @.@ 76 m ) long with a beam of 13 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) and a draft of 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) . For propulsion , she featured a single shaft , a single 450 bhp ( 340 kW ) diesel engine for surface running , and a single 160 shp ( 120 kW ) electric motor for submerged travel . She was capable of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) while surfaced and 9 knots ( 17 km / h ) while submerged . Although there is no specific notation of a range for U @-@ 21 , the Havmanden class , upon which the U @-@ 20 class was based , had a range of 1 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ) , surfaced , and 23 nautical miles ( 43 km ) at 8 knots ( 15 km / h ) submerged . 
 U @-@ 21 was armed with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 66 mm / 26 ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) deck gun and an 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun .

U @-@ 21 was commissioned on 15 August under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Seyffertitz . A 31 @-@ year @-@ old native of Brixen , von Seyffertitz was a first @-@ time U @-@ boat commander . 
 Ten days after commissioning , U @-@ 21 safely submerged to a depth of 42 metres ( 138 ft ) .

On 29 September , von Seyffertitz steered the boat from the submarine base at Brioni to Cattaro , where she arrived on 1 October . On 4 October , U @-@ 21 set out for a patrol off the coast of Albania , but had returned to Cattaro by mid October . 
 On 15 October , von Seyffertitz and U @-@ 21 departed from Cattaro to begin their first Mediterranean deployment .

 Rickey Nelson Henley Henderson ( born December 25 , 1958 ) is an American retired professional baseball left fielder who played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for nine teams from 1979 to 2003 , including four stints with his original team , the Oakland Athletics . Nicknamed " The Man of Steal " , he is widely regarded as baseball 's most reliable leadoff hitter and baserunner . He holds the major league records for career stolen bases , runs , unintentional walks and leadoff home runs . At the time of his last major league game in 2003 , the ten @-@ time American League ( AL ) All @-@ Star ranked among the sport 's top 100 all @-@ time home run hitters and was its all @-@ time leader in base on balls . In 2009 , he was inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame on his first ballot appearance . 
 Henderson also holds the single @-@ season record for stolen bases ( 130 in 1982 ) and is the only player in AL history to steal 100 bases in a season , having done so three times . His 1 @,@ 406 career steals is 50 % higher than the previous record of 938 by Lou Brock . Henderson is the all @-@ time stolen base leader for the Oakland A 's and previously held the New York Yankees ' franchise record from 1988 to 2011 . He was among the league 's top ten base stealers in 21 different seasons . 
 Henderson was named the AL 's Most Valuable Player in 1990 , and he was the leadoff hitter for two World Series champions : the 1989 Oakland A 's and the 1993 Toronto Blue Jays . A 12 @-@ time stolen base champion , Henderson led the league in runs five times . His 25 @-@ year career elevated Henderson to the top ten in several other categories , including career at bats , games , and outfield putouts and total chances . His high on @-@ base percentage , power hitting , and stolen base and run totals made him one of the most dynamic players of his era . He was further known for his unquenchable passion for playing baseball and a buoyant , eccentric and quotable personality that both perplexed and entertained fans . Once asked if he thought Henderson was a future Hall of Famer , statistician Bill James replied , " If you could split him in two , you 'd have two Hall of Famers . "

 Henderson was born in Chicago , Illinois , and named Rickey Nelson Henley , named after singer @-@ actor Ricky Nelson , to John L. Henley and Bobbie Henley on Christmas Day , 1958 , in Chicago , in the back seat of an Oldsmobile on the way to the hospital . Henderson later joked , " I was already fast . I couldn 't wait . " When he was two years old , his father left home , and his family moved to Oakland , California , when he was seven . His father died in an automobile accident ten years after leaving home . His mother married Paul Henderson in Rickey Henley 's junior year of high school and the family adopted the Henderson surname . As a child learning to play baseball in Oakland , Henderson developed the ability to bat right @-@ handed although he was a naturally left @-@ handed thrower — a rare combination for baseball players , especially non @-@ pitchers . In the entire history of Major League Baseball through the 2008 season , only 57 position players are known to have batted right and thrown left , and Henderson is easily the most successful player to do so . Henderson later said , " All my friends were right @-@ handed and swung from the right side , so I thought that 's the way it was supposed to be done . " 
 In 1976 , Henderson graduated from Oakland Technical High School , where he played baseball , basketball and football , and was an All @-@ American running back with a pair of 1 @,@ 000 @-@ yard rushing seasons . He also ran track , but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball . Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football . Despite a childhood dream to play for the Oakland Raiders , he turned down the scholarships on the advice of his mother , who argued that football players had shorter careers . In 1983 , Henderson married his high @-@ school sweetheart , Pamela . They have three children : Angela , Alexis , and Adrianna .

 Henderson was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the fourth round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft . He spent the first season of his minor league career with the Boise A 's of the Northwest League . In 46 games , Henderson batted .336 and hit three home runs and two triples . Henderson spent the following season with the Modesto A 's . He batted .345 in 134 games during his record @-@ setting season with Modesto . Henderson , along with Darrell Woodard , nearly broke the league record for team stolen bases . The Modesto A 's finished the season with 357 stolen bases , just shy of the league record of 370 . While Woodard tied the single @-@ season player record with 90 stolen bases , Henderson beat the record by stealing 95 bases , and was awarded the Sundial Trophy , given to the Modesto A 's Most Valuable Player . 
 Henderson spent the 1978 season with the Jersey City A 's of the Eastern League . After the minor league season ended , he played the 1978 – 1979 winter season for the Navojoa <unk> of the Mexican Pacific League . He played in six games for the team , which won its first championship . In 1979 , Henderson started the season with the Ogden A 's of the Pacific Coast League . In 71 games for Ogden , he had a batting average of .309 and stole 44 bases .

 Henderson made his major league debut with Oakland on June 24 , 1979 , getting two hits in four at bats , along with a stolen base . He batted .274 with 33 stolen bases in 89 games . In 1980 , Henderson became the 3rd modern @-@ era player to steal 100 bases in a season ( Maury Wills 's 104 in 1962 and Lou Brock 's 118 in 1974 had preceded him ) . His 100 steals broke Eddie Collins ' franchise record of 81 in 1910 with what were then the Philadelphia Athletics and set a new American League ( AL ) record , surpassing Ty Cobb 's 96 set in 1915 . He also batted .303 , had 179 hits ( tied for 9th in AL ) , scored 111 runs ( 4th in AL ) , drew 117 walks ( 2nd in AL ) , had a <unk> on base % ( 3rd in AL ) and led the AL by reaching base 301 times . 
 That winter , Henderson played in the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League ; his 42 stolen bases broke that league 's record as well . 
 Henderson was a Most Valuable Player candidate a year later , in a season shortened by a players ' strike . He hit .319 , fourth in the AL , and led the league in hits ( 135 ) , runs ( 89 ) and in steals ( 56 ) . Henderson was also 3rd in on @-@ base percentage ( .408 ) , tied for 2nd in triples ( 7 ) , 4th in walks ( 64 ) , 8th in total bases ( 185 ) and 2nd in times reaching base ( 201 ) . In so doing , he became the emblematic figure of Oakland manager Billy Martin 's aggressive " Billy Ball " philosophy , which received much media attention . Finishing second to the Milwaukee Brewers ' Rollie Fingers in the MVP voting , Henderson 's fielding that season also earned him his only Gold Glove Award . He later became known for his showboating " snatch catches " , in which he would flick his glove out at incoming fly balls , then whip his arm behind his back after making the catch . 
 In 1982 , Henderson broke Lou Brock 's major league single season record by stealing 130 bases , a total which has not been approached since . He stole 84 bases by the All @-@ Star break ; no player has stolen as many as 84 bases in an entire season since 1988 , when Henderson himself stole 93 . Henderson 's 130 steals outpaced nine of the American League 's 14 teams that season . He also led the AL in walks ( 116 ) , was 4th in runs ( 119 ) and 3rd in on base % ( .398 ) . 
 Henderson adopted an exaggerated crouch as his batting stance , which reduced his strike zone without sacrificing much power . Sportswriter Jim Murray described Henderson 's strike zone as being " smaller than Hitler 's heart " . In 1982 , he described his approach to Sports Illustrated : 
 I found that if I squatted down real low at the plate ... I could see the ball better . I also knew it threw the pitcher off . I found that I could put my weight on my back foot and still turn my hips on the swing . I 'm down so low I don 't have much of a strike zone . Sometimes , walking so much even gets me mad . Last year Ed Ott of the Angels got so frustrated because the umpire was calling balls that would 've been strikes on anybody else that he stood up and shouted at me , " Stand up and hit like a man . " I guess I do that to people . 
 Henderson made MLB history in 1983 with his 3rd 100 runs / 100 stolen bases / 100 bases on balls season ( no modern player , post 1900 has done it once ) , when he led the AL with 108 stolen bases & 103 walks while finishing 4th scoring 103 runs . He was 2nd with .414 on base % , tied for 9th in triples with 7 and 5th times on base , reaching 257 times . In the final season of his first stint in Oakland Henderson started to develop more of a power stroke hitting 16 home runs , leading the league in stolen bases , finishing 2nd in runs scored and 3rd in on base % . After the season he was traded to the New York Yankees . 
 As his muscular frame developed , Henderson continued to improve as a hitter . His increasing power @-@ hitting ability eventually led to a record for home runs to lead off a game . During his career , he hit over 20 home runs in four different seasons , with a high of 28 in 1986 and again in 1990 . 
 = = = New York Yankees ( 1985 – 1989 ) = = = 
 In December 1984 , Henderson was traded to the New York Yankees along with Bert Bradley for five players : Tim <unk> , Jay Howell , Stan Javier , Eric <unk> , and José Rijo . In his first season with the Yankees he led the league in runs scored ( 146 ) and stolen bases ( 80 ) , was fourth in batting average ( .314 ) , walks ( 99 ) and on @-@ base percentage ( .419 ) , 7th in slugging ( .516 ) , 3rd in OPS ( .934 ) and hit 24 home runs . He also won the Silver Slugger Award , and was third in the voting for the MVP award . His 146 runs scored were the most since Ted Williams had 150 in 1950 , and he became the first player since Jimmie Foxx in 1939 to amass more runs scored than games played . Henderson became the first player in major league history to reach 80 stolen bases and 20 home runs in the 1985 season . He matched the feat in 1986 , as did the Reds ' Eric Davis ; they remain the only players in major league history who are in the " 80 / 20 club " . 
 In 1986 , he led the AL in runs scored ( 130 ) and stolen bases ( 87 ) for the second year in a row , and was seventh in walks ( 89 ) and extra base hits ( 64 ) while hitting 28 home runs , 9 of which led off games , and had 74 RBIs . 
 In 1987 he had a below @-@ average season by his standards , fueling criticism from the New York media , which had never covered Henderson or his eccentricities kindly . Yankees owner George Steinbrenner issued a press release claiming that manager Lou Piniella wanted to trade Henderson for " <unk> it " ( playing <unk> ) . Still , Henderson had his best on @-@ base percentage to that point in his career ( .423 ) , was fifth in the AL in stolen bases ( 41 ) and hit 17 home runs despite playing only 95 games . It was the only season from 1980 to 1991 in which Henderson did not lead the AL in steals . Seattle 's Harold Reynolds led the league with 60 steals ; Reynolds tells the story of getting an impish phone call from Henderson after the season : 
 " The phone rings . ' Henderson here . ' I say , ' Hey , what 's going on , Rickey ? ' I think he 's calling to congratulate me , but he goes , ' Sixty stolen bases ? You ought to be ashamed . Rickey would have 60 at the break . ' And then click , he hung up . " 
 In 1988 , Henderson led the AL in steals ( 93 ) , was third in runs scored ( 118 ) , fifth in OBP ( .394 ) and seventh in walks ( 82 ) , while hitting .305 . Though only in New York for four and a half seasons , Henderson set the Yankees ' franchise record with 326 stolen bases ; the previous high ( 248 ) had been held by Hal Chase . On May 28 , 2011 , Henderson 's total was surpassed by Derek Jeter , who 'd played 1 @,@ 700 more games as a Yankee than Henderson . 
 = = = Second stint with the Oakland Athletics ( 1989 – 1993 ) = = = 
 Following a mid @-@ season trade to Oakland in 1989 , Henderson reasserted himself as one of the game 's greatest players , with a memorable half @-@ season in which his 52 steals and 72 runs scored led the A 's into the postseason ; his 126 walks for the year were the most for any AL hitter since 1970 . With a record eight steals in five games , he was named MVP of the American League Championship Series ; he hit .400 while scoring eight runs and delivering two home runs , five runs batted in ( RBI ) , seven walks and a 1 @.@ 000 slugging percentage . Leading the A 's to a four @-@ game sweep over the San Francisco Giants and the franchise 's first World Series title since 1974 , Henderson hit <unk> with an .895 slugging average ( including two triples and a homer ) , while stealing three more bases . On August 22 , 1989 , he became Nolan Ryan 's 5,000th strikeout victim , but Henderson took an odd delight in the occurrence , saying , " If you haven 't been struck out by Nolan Ryan , you 're nobody . " 
 A year later , Henderson finished second in the league in batting average with a mark of .325 , losing out to the Kansas City Royals ' George Brett on the final day of the season . Henderson had a remarkably consistent season , with his batting average falling below .320 for only one game , the third of the year . Reaching safely by a hit or a walk in 125 of his 136 games , he led the league in runs ( 119 ) , stolen bases ( 65 ) , on @-@ base percentage ( .439 ) and OPS ( 1 @.@ 016 ) was 2nd in slugging % ( <unk> ) , 4th in walks ( 97 ) and extra base hits ( 66 ) , 6th in home runs ( 28 ) and total bases ( 282 ) and had 61 RBI and Henderson won the AL 's MVP award and helped Oakland to another pennant . He again performed well in the World Series ( .333 batting , .667 slugging , a home run and three steals in four games ) , but the A 's were swept by the underdog Cincinnati Reds . 
 On May 1 , 1991 , Henderson broke one of baseball 's most noted records when he stole the <unk> base of his career , one more than Lou Brock 's total compiled from 1962 to 1979 , mainly with the St. Louis Cardinals . 
 In 1993 , Henderson was having another outstanding season when he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays at the trade deadline . In 90 games with Oakland , he was batting .327 ( 2nd in AL ) with 17 home runs and 47 RBIs . He also had scored 77 runs , stolen 31 bases , drew 85 walks , had a .469 on @-@ base percentage and was slugging .553 . 
 = = = Toronto Blue Jays ( 1993 ) = = = 
 In July 1993 , the Athletics traded Henderson to the playoff @-@ bound Toronto Blue Jays for Steve <unk> and José Herrera . He performed disappointingly for the Jays , hitting only .215 in 44 games , which was probably due to the fact that he fractured a bone on his hand early on with the team , after being hit by a pitch , although he still contributed 22 stolen bases and 37 runs scored . However , his hitting woes continued in the post @-@ season , batting <unk> in the American League Championship Series and .227 in the World Series . Nevertheless , Henderson was involved in the final play of the World Series that year in one fashion for which he was most known , as he and Paul Molitor scored on Joe Carter 's Series @-@ ending home run . After winning his second World Series ring , this one with Toronto , he re @-@ signed as a free agent with Oakland in December 1993 . 
 = = = Third stint with the Oakland Athletics ( 1994 – 1995 ) = = = 
 In 1994 and 1995 , Henderson finished in the top 10 in the league in walks , steals and on @-@ base percentage . His .300 average in 1995 marked his sixth and final season in the AL with a .300 or better average .

 In August 1997 , Henderson was traded from the Padres to the Anaheim Angels . His brief stint as an Angel was uneventful , with him batting only <unk> for the rest of the 1997 baseball year with the Angels .

 In January 1998 , Henderson signed as a free agent with the Athletics , the fourth time he played for the franchise . That season he led the AL in stolen bases ( 66 ) and walks ( 118 ) , while scoring 101 runs . 
 = = = New York Mets ( 1999 – 2000 ) = = = 
 A year later , Henderson signed as a free agent with the New York Mets . In 1999 , he batted .315 with 37 steals and was seventh in the NL in on @-@ base percentage — his .423 OBP was his ninth year in a row above .400 . Henderson was voted the 1999 National League comeback player of the year . He wore number 24 , which — although not officially retired — had not been regularly worn by a Mets player since Willie Mays ' retirement in 1973 . Nonetheless , Henderson and the Mets were an uneasy fit . Following the Mets ' loss in the 1999 NLCS , the New York press made much of a card game between Henderson and Bobby Bonilla . Both players had been substituted out of the lineup , and they reportedly left the dugout before the playoff game had concluded . 
 = = = Seattle Mariners ( 2000 ) = = = 
 In May 2000 , Henderson was released by the Mets , and quickly signed as a free agent with the Seattle Mariners . In only his second game as a Mariner , on May 20 , Henderson hit a leadoff home run , thus becoming the third player to hit a home run in four different decades ( Ted Williams and Willie McCovey were the others , and Omar Vizquel became the fourth in 2010 ) . Despite the late start , Henderson finished fourth in the AL in stolen bases ( 31 ) . 
 = = = Second stint with the San Diego Padres ( 2001 ) = = = 
 A free agent in March 2001 , Henderson returned to the Padres . During the 2001 season , he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone . He broke Babe Ruth 's record of 2 @,@ 062 career walks , Ty Cobb 's record of 2 @,@ 245 career runs , and Zack Wheat 's record of 2 @,@ 328 career games in left field , and on the final day of the season collected his 3,000th career hit , a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson . That final game was also Padre legend Tony Gwynn 's last major league game , and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion , but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play . After scoring the game 's first run , Henderson was removed from the lineup . With Gwynn having 3 @,@ 141 hits , it was just the second time in Major League history that a pair of teammates each had 3 @,@ 000 career hits ; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had previously played many games together for the 1928 A 's . 
 At the age of 42 , in his last substantial major league season , Henderson finished the year with 25 stolen bases , ninth in the NL ; it also marked his 23rd consecutive season with more than 20 steals . Of the ten top base stealers who were still active as of 2002 , the other nine each stole fewer bases in 2002 than the 42 @-@ year @-@ old Henderson . 
 = = = Boston Red Sox ( 2002 ) = = = 
 In February 2002 , Henderson signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox , where at age 43 he became the oldest player to play center field in major league history when he replaced Johnny Damon for three games in April and another in July . Henderson 's arrival was marked by a statistical oddity . During the 22 @-@ 1 / 2 years from his June 1979 debut through the end of the 2001 season , he had stolen more bases by himself than his new team had : 1 @,@ 395 steals for Henderson , 1 @,@ 382 for the Boston franchise . The Red Sox finally " passed " Henderson on April 30 , 2002 . At 43 , Henderson was the oldest player in the American League .

 As the 2003 season began , Henderson was without a team for the first time in his career . He played in the independent Atlantic League with the Newark Bears , hoping for a chance with another major league organization . After much media attention , the Los Angeles Dodgers signed him over the All @-@ Star break after he was named the league 's All @-@ Star game MVP . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 Before the 2003 season , his last in the majors , Henderson discussed his reputation for hanging onto his lengthy baseball career : 
 " Each and every day I set a record , but we never talk about it . We 'll talk about a home run hitter 24 / 7 . Well , they haven 't broken any all @-@ time records , but they hit homers , and that 's what matters nowadays . You continue playing , you accomplish a lot , and you 'd think people would look at it as a fantastic career . Instead , Rickey thinks people want Rickey to quit more than anything . " 
 Henderson played his last major league game on September 19 , 2003 ; he was hit by a pitch in his only plate appearance , and came around to score his <unk> run . Though it became increasingly unlikely that he would return to major league action , his status continued to confound , as he publicly debated his own official retirement from professional baseball . After leaving the Dodgers , Henderson started his second consecutive season with the Newark Bears in the spring of 2004 . In 91 games he had a .462 OBP , with more than twice as many walks ( 96 ) as strikeouts ( 41 ) , and stole 37 bases while being caught only twice . On May 9 , 2005 , Henderson signed with the San Diego Surf Dawgs of the Golden Baseball League , an independent league . This was the <unk> ' and the Golden Baseball League 's inaugural season , and Henderson helped the team to the league championship . In 73 games he had a .456 OBP , with 73 walks while striking out 43 times , and 16 steals while being caught only twice . It would be his final professional season . 
 Henderson would not accept the end of his major league career . In May 2005 , he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues . NBC and ESPN reported that Henderson had announced his much @-@ delayed official retirement on December 6 , 2005 , but his agent denied the report the following day . On February 10 , 2006 , he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets , while leaving the door open to returning as a player . In July 2006 , Henderson discussed an offer he 'd received to rejoin the <unk> for the 2006 season , which would have been his 31st in professional baseball , but suggested he 'd had enough . But six weeks later , on August 11 , he claimed " It 's sort of weird not to be playing , but I decided to take a year off " , adding , " I can 't say I will retire . My heart is still in it ... I still love the game right now , so I 'm going to wait it out and see what happens . " 
 On May 18 , 2007 , the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September , provided it did not " infringe on the integrity of the roster or of the season " , so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A 's player . A month later , Henderson appeared to reject the overture , saying , " One day ? I don 't want one day . I want to play again , man . I don 't want nobody 's spot ... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there . If I don 't , just get rid of me , release me . And if I belong , you don 't have to pay me but the minimum — and I 'll donate every penny of that to some charity . So , how 's that hurtin ' anybody ? ... Don 't say goodbye for me ... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad , I 'll let you know . " The Athletics retired Henderson 's # 24 on August 1 , 2009 . 
 Henderson finally conceded his " official retirement " on July 13 , 2007 : " I haven 't submitted retirement papers to MLB , but I think MLB already had their papers that I was retired . " Characteristically , he added , " If it was a situation where we were going to win the World Series and I was the only player that they had left , I would put on the shoes . " 
 Contrary to speculation , Henderson 's refusal to officially retire had not been delaying his eligibility for Hall of Fame induction . Since the 1970s , the five @-@ year waiting period has been based on major league service only . Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote , in his first appearance on the ballot . At a press conference two days after his election , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Henderson told reporters , " I believe today , and people say I ’ m crazy , but if you gave me as many at @-@ bats that you would give the runners out there today , I would <unk> every last one of them ... they can always ring my phone and I 'll come on down and help their ballclub , that 's how much I love the game . " 
 In 2011 , on the 20th anniversary of his record @-@ breaking stolen base , the Oakland A 's held " Rickey Henderson Bobblehead Day . " At Henderson 's insistence , the giveaway plastic dolls had one atypical modification : " I told them , put a little dirt on mine , make sure that [ it looks ] like I 'm playing the game . " Almost eight years after his final game , Henderson also reiterated his desire to return : " Sometimes when I sit around and look at the game and things ain 't going right , I just think , ' Just let me put on the uniform and go out there and take a chance ' . " 
 = = = Coaching = = = 
 The New York Mets hired Henderson as a special instructor in 2006 , primarily to work with hitters and to teach base stealing . Henderson 's impact was noticeable on José Reyes , the Mets ' former leadoff hitter . " I always want to be around the game " , Henderson said in May 2007 . " That 's something that 's in my blood . Helping them have success feels just as good . " 
 On July 13 , 2007 , the Mets promoted Henderson from special instructor to first base coach , replacing Howard Johnson , who became the hitting coach . Henderson was not retained as a coach for 2008 . Henderson has periodically been a special instructor in the Athletics ' spring training camps . In 2010 , he worked on base stealing ( most notably with Rajai Davis and Coco Crisp ) and outfield drills .

 Sports Illustrated 's Tom Verducci wrote in 2003 , " There are certain figures in American history who have passed into the realm of cultural mythology , as if reality could no longer contain their stories : Johnny Appleseed . Wild Bill Hickok . Davy Crockett . Rickey Henderson . They exist on the sometimes narrow margin between Fact and Fiction . " 
 Henderson was known for being an <unk> , referring to himself in the third person . One unconfirmed story reports seeing him standing naked in front of a mirror before a game , practicing his swing , and declaring , " Rickey 's the best ! Rickey 's the best ! " According to Verducci , during one off @-@ season , Henderson called Padres general manager Kevin Towers and left this message : " Kevin , this is Rickey . Calling on behalf of Rickey . Rickey wants to play baseball . " However , Henderson denied that this happened in a February 26 , 2009 interview on Mike and Mike in the Morning . In 2003 , he discussed his unusual phraseology , saying , " People are always saying , ' Rickey says Rickey . ' But it 's been blown way out of proportion . Rickey says it when Rickey doesn 't do what Rickey needs to be doing . Rickey uses it to remind himself , like , <unk> , what you doing , you stupid .... ' Rickey 's just scolding himself . " Henderson did use the first person pronoun on occasion , such as when he defended his position during a contract dispute : " All I 'm asking for is what I want . " 
 Henderson was so proud of a $ 1 million signing bonus that he framed it instead of cashing it , thus losing several months ' interest . In 2002 , following an argument with pitcher Orlando Hernández , Henderson stated , " He needs to grow up a little bit . I ain 't a kid . When I broke into the game , he was crawling on his hands and knees . Unless he 's as old as I am . He probably is . " 
 There are many unconfirmed stories about Henderson . A Padres teammate ( variously reported as Steve Finley or Tony Gwynn ) once offered him a seat anywhere on the bus , saying that Henderson had tenure . Henderson supposedly replied , " Ten years ? What are you talking about ? Rickey got 16 , 17 years . " One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player . While playing for Seattle in 2000 , Henderson was said to have commented on first baseman John Olerud 's practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense , noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing . Olerud was reported to have replied , " That was me . " The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets , as well as with the 1993 World Champion Blue Jays . Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact . 
 Verducci wrote , " Rickey is the modern @-@ day Yogi Berra , only faster . " Henderson himself is resigned to his persona : " A lot of stuff they had me doing or something they said I had created , it 's comedy . I guess that 's how they want to judge me , as a character . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 On May 1 , 1991 , Henderson stole his <unk> base to pass Lou Brock and became the sport 's all @-@ time stolen base leader . Henderson 's speech ( at right ) after breaking Brock 's record was similar to the standard victory or award speech . He thanked God and his mother , as well as the people that helped him in baseball . Because his idol was Muhammad Ali , Henderson decided to use the words " greatest of all time . " These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant , although years later , Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock , and the Cardinals Hall of Famer " had no problem with it . In fact , he helped me write what I was going to say that day . " On the day of the speech , Brock later told reporters amiably , " He spoke from his heart . " Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981 . Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record , saying , " How are we gonna break it ? " 
 Henderson has mixed feelings about his comments : 
 " As soon as I said it , it ruined everything . Everybody thought it was the worst thing you could ever say . Those words haunt me to this day , and will continue to haunt me . They overshadow what I 've accomplished in this game . " 
 At the end of his July 2009 Hall of Fame induction , Henderson alluded to his earlier speech , saying : 
 " In closing , I would like to say my favorite hero was Muhammad Ali . He said at one time , quote , ' I am the greatest , ' end of quote . That is something I always wanted to be . And now that the Association has voted me into the Baseball Hall of Fame , my journey as a player is complete . I am now in the class of the greatest players of all time . And at this moment , I am ... [ pause ] ... very , very humble . Thank you . " 
 Asked if he believes the passage of time will improve his reputation , Henderson said : 
 " If you talk about baseball , you can 't eliminate me , because I 'm all over baseball ... It 's the truth . Telling the truth isn 't being cocky . What do you want me to say , that I didn 't put up the numbers ? That my teams didn 't win a lot of games ? People don 't want me to say anything about what I 've done . Then why don 't you say it ? Because if I don 't say it and you don 't say it , nobody says it . " 
 Henderson had 468 more stolen bases in his career than Brock , one short of 50 % more than the game 's second @-@ most prolific <unk> . In 1993 , Henderson stole his <unk> base , surpassing the record established ten years earlier by Yutaka <unk> for the Hankyu Braves in Japan 's Pacific League . In his prime , Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League . Between 1980 and 1991 , he led the league in steals every season except 1987 , when he missed part of the season due to a nagging hamstring injury , allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title . Henderson had one more league @-@ leading season after that stretch , when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history . Perhaps unsurprisingly , Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing ( 335 ) . Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic , though , it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader . However , Henderson 's overall 81 % success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history . ( Tim Raines ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts , at 84 % . ) On July 29 , 1989 , Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners ' left @-@ handed Randy Johnson , his career high , and one shy of the single @-@ game major league record . Unusually , Henderson was hitless in the game ( he had four walks ) . Henderson had 18 four @-@ steal games during his career . In August 1983 , in a three @-@ game series against the Brewers and a 2 @-@ game series versus the Yankees , Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games . Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd <unk> described the confusion he felt during a particular game , when Henderson was leading off first base and signalling him with two fingers . Henderson quickly stole second base , then third , and <unk> understood the gesture . 
 Longtime scout Charlie Metro remembered the havoc caused by Henderson : ' " I did a lot of study and I found that it 's impossible to throw Rickey Henderson out . I started using stopwatches and everything . I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also . They can go from first to second in 2 @.@ 9 seconds ; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2 @.@ 9 seconds , it was always 3 , 3 @.@ 1 , 3 @.@ 2 . So actually , the runner that can make the continuous , regular move like Rickey 's can 't be thrown out , and he 's proven it . " 
 Joe Posnanski of the Kansas City Star and Sports Illustrated wrote : 
 " I ’ m about to give you one of my all @-@ time favorite statistics : Rickey Henderson walked 796 times in his career <unk> OFF AN <unk> . Think about this again . There would be nothing , absolutely nothing , a pitcher would want to avoid more than walking Rickey Henderson to lead off an inning . And yet he walked <unk> <unk> <unk> SIX times to lead off an inning . 
 He walked more times just leading off in an inning than Lou Brock , Roberto Clemente , Luis Aparicio , Ernie Banks , Kirby Puckett , Ryne Sandberg and more than 50 other Hall of Famers walked in their entire careers ... I simply cannot imagine a baseball statistic more staggering . " 
 Henderson was a headfirst slider . In September 2008 , Henderson discussed his base stealing technique at length with Sports Illustrated : 
 " I wanted to know how to dive into the base because I was getting strawberries on my knees and strawberries on my ass ... I was thinking about head @-@ first versus feet @-@ first , and wondering which would save my body . With head @-@ first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands , and with feet @-@ first I would worry about my knees and my legs . I felt that running was more important to me , with my legs , so I started going head @-@ first . I got my [ low @-@ to @-@ the @-@ ground ] technique from airplanes ... I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up . Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth . So I asked the pilot why , and he said when you land a plane smooth , you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in . Same with sliding ... If you dive when you 're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground . But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take ... I was hitting the dirt so smooth , so fast , when I hit the dirt , there wasn 't no hesitation . It was like a skid mark , like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it . So when I hit the ground , if you didn 't have the tag down , I was by you . No matter if the ball beat me , I was by you . That was what made the close plays go my way , I think . " 
 Padres closer Trevor Hoffman said , " I don 't know how to put into words how fortunate I was to spend time around one of the icons of the game . I can 't comprehend that yet . Years from now , though , I 'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson , and I imagine it will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth . " Padres general manager Kevin Towers said , " I get e @-@ mails daily from fans saying , ' Sign Rickey . ' ... I get more calls and e @-@ mails about him than anybody ... We 've had some special players come through San Diego . But there 's an aura about him nobody else has . " 
 Tony La Russa , Henderson 's manager in the late 1980s in Oakland , said , " He rises to the occasion — the big moment — better than anybody I 've ever seen . " Coach Rene <unk> said , " If you 're one run down , there 's nobody you 'd ever rather have up at the plate than Rickey . " Teammate Mitchell Page said , " It wasn 't until I saw Rickey that I understood what baseball was about . Rickey Henderson is a run , man . That 's it . When you see Rickey Henderson , I don 't care when , the score 's already 1 – 0 . If he 's with you , that 's great . If he 's not , you won 't like it . " 
 A 's pitching coach Dave Duncan said of Henderson , " You have to be careful because he can knock one out . But you don 't want to be too careful because he 's got a small strike zone and you can 't afford to walk him . And that 's only half the problem . When he gets on base he 's more trouble still . " Sportswriter Tom Verducci wrote , " Baseball is designed to be an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 is not supposed to dominate ... Yet in the past quarter century Henderson and Barry Bonds have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way Michael Jordan could a basketball game . " In July 2007 , New York Sun sportswriter Tim <unk> wrote about Henderson 's accomplishments : 
 He stole all those bases and scored all those runs and played all those years not because of his body , but because of his brain . Rickey could tell from the faintest , most undetectable twitch of a pitcher 's muscles whether he was going home or throwing over to first . He understood that conditioning isn 't about strength , but about flexibility . And more than anyone else in the history of the game , he understood that baseball is entirely a game of discipline — the discipline to work endless 1 – 1 counts your way , the discipline to understand that your job is to get on base , and the discipline to understand that the season is more important than the game , and a career more important than the season . Maybe he 'd get a bit more credit for all this if he were some boring drip like Cal Ripken Jr . , <unk> on endlessly about humility and apple pie and tradition and whatever else , but we 're all better off with things the way they are ... Everyone had their fun when he broke Lou Brock 's stolen base record and proclaimed , ' I am the greatest ' , but he was , of course , just saying what was plainly true . 
 = = = Career milestones = = = 
 As of 2014 , Henderson ranks fourth all @-@ time in career games played ( 3 @,@ 081 ) , tenth in at bats ( 10 @,@ 961 ) , twenty @-@ second in hits ( 3 @,@ 055 ) , and first in runs scored ( 2 @,@ 295 ) and stolen bases ( 1 @,@ 406 ) . His record for most career walks ( 2 @,@ 190 ) has since been broken by Barry Bonds ; Henderson is now second . He also holds the record for most home runs to lead off a game , with 81 ; Alfonso Soriano of the New York Yankees is tied for the second @-@ most ever with Craig Biggio , with 53 . During the 2003 season , Henderson surpassed Babe Ruth for the career record in secondary bases ( total bases compiled from extra base hits , walks , stolen bases , and times hit by pitch ) . In 1993 , he led off both games of a doubleheader with homers . At the time of his last major league game , Henderson was still in the all @-@ time top 100 home run hitters , with 297 . Bill James wrote in 2000 , " Without exaggerating one inch , you could find fifty Hall of Famers who , all taken together , don 't own as many records , and as many important records , as Rickey Henderson . " 
 Henderson 's eight steals during the 1989 ALCS broke Lou Brock 's postseason record for a single series . His record for the most postseason stolen bases was broken by Kenny Lofton 's 34th career steal during the 2007 ALCS ; however , Lofton accomplished his total in 95 postseason games compared to Henderson 's 60 . Henderson is the only American League player to steal more than 100 bases in a single season , and he is the all @-@ time stolen base leader for the Oakland A 's . 
 In 1999 , before breaking the career records for runs scored and walks , Henderson was ranked number 51 on The Sporting News ' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players , and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All @-@ Century Team . In 2005 , The Sporting News updated their 100 Greatest Players list , and Henderson had inched up to number 50 . On January 12 , 2009 , Henderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot , receiving 94 @.@ 8 % of the vote . This was the 13th highest percentage in major league history . 
 Asked to choose the best player in history , Henderson declined , saying , " There are guys who have done different things very well , but I don 't know of anyone who mastered everything . " Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game 's greats , he said , " I haven 't mastered the homers or RBI . The little things , I probably mastered . " Of his various records and achievements , he values his career runs scored mark the most : " You have to score to win . "

 = Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 = 
 Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is a provision of the Human Rights Act 1998 that enables the Act to take effect in the United Kingdom . The section requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights , which are also part of the Human Rights Act 1998 . This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation , and includes past and future legislation , therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation . 
 Courts have applied section 3 of the Act through three forms of interpretation : " reading in " – inserting words where there are none in a statute ; " reading out " where words are omitted from a statute ; and " reading down " where a particular meaning is chosen to be in compliance . They do not interpret statutes to conflict with legislative intent , and courts have been reluctant in particular to " read out " provisions for this reason . If it is not possible to so interpret , they may issue a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 . 
 The relationship between sections 3 and 4 and parliamentary sovereignty has been commented on most extensively . The most common criticism has been of the implied limitations on legislative supremacy . Opponents of this criticism has questioned both its factual accuracy and its suggestion that the weakening of parliamentary sovereignty should be avoided . They instead cite morality and constitutionalism as among positive features of this change . The limits of courts ' powers have also been queried . The retroactivity of law making is one criticism related to the rule of law , although the advancement of human rights is seen as a positive feature also associated with the rule of law . Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague and there have been warnings of to the imposition of the judiciary on parliament 's domain , these have also been challenged . 
 = = Context = = 
 Human rights are rights taken to be universal , of considerable importance , and relate to the individual and not collectively ; among other things , they can grant freedoms , claims , immunities and powers . The European Convention on Human Rights was drawn up in the wake of the Second World War to uphold such rights . The United Kingdom ratified the European Convention on Human Rights in 1951 , and accepted the right of individual petition to the European Court of Human Rights , Strasbourg , in 1966 . The Human Rights Act 1998 made most Convention rights directly enforceable in a British court for the first time . Excluded are Articles 1 and 13 , which the government argued were fulfilled by the Act itself , and therefore were not relevant to rights enforced under it . The Human Rights Act has had a considerable effect on British law , and remains an Act of " fundamental constitutional importance " . 
 = = Provisions = = 
 Section 3 ( 1 ) states that " So far as it is possible to do so , primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights . " Accordingly , a court must read any statute passed by parliament so as to uphold Convention rights , where this is possible . It is possibly the section of the act with the widest scope . The Human Rights Act therefore built upon a small number of previously recognised absolute freedoms which could only be expressly subjugated to another aim . This is different from other systems , such as the New Zealand Bill of Rights , that require an interpretation to be " reasonable " . As happened in R ( Anderson ) v Home Secretary , the alternative where such interpretation is not possible the alternative is a declaration of incompatibility under Section 4 . Lord Hoffmann in a case , R ( Simms ) v Home Secretary , which bridged the introduction of the Human Rights Act , said : 
 Parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament can , if it chooses , legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights . The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power . The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political , not legal . But the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost . Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words . This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process . In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary , the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual . In this way the courts of the United Kingdom , though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament , apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document . 
 " Read and give effect " requires the interpretation " where possible " of legislation – where there is an interpretation open to the court that is consistent with Convention rights , it must be chosen over those that do not . Following the introduction of the Human Rights Act , there was some disagreement between judges as to how far this provision went . Lord Steyn , in R v A , has said " the interpretative obligation under section 3 of the 1998 Act is a strong one . It applies even if there is no ambiguity in the language in the sense of the language being capable of two different meanings . " He further noted that it may be necessary under section 3 to " adopt an interpretation which linguistically may appear strained " and that a declaration of <unk> was a " measure of last resort " . However , In re S established that there may be cases where interpretation can go to far ; that the court can assume an administrative power it would not ordinarily have , with practical consequences that it is not best placed to consider : " a meaning which departs substantially from a fundamental feature of an Act of Parliament is likely to have crossed the boundary between interpretation and amendment . " Given that the precise wording of a statute could be altered under the section , the " thrust " was important ; going against the " thrust " required legislative power that the courts did not have . Although other sources could be used ( see , for example , Pepper v Hart ) , the wording of a statute must be considered the primary intent of parliament . The decision in <unk> v Godin @-@ Mendoza appears to have achieved some settling of the approach taken in extreme cases . 
 Section 3 ( 2 ) ( a ) extends the scope of section 3 to past and future Acts of Parliament in addition to present legislation . It therefore contradicts the usual policy of implied repeal – whereby any inconsistency between statutes are resolved in favour of the later statute . The Human Rights Act must therefore be explicitly ( or " expressly " ) repealed by an Act of Parliament deliberately doing so , not merely be introducing contradictory legislation . The act therefore carries an additional normative force and has been considered constitutional in character as a result . It is widely recognised that parliament may never directly contradict convention rights , or at least do so very rarely . Sections 3 ( 2 ) ( b ) and 3 ( 2 ) ( c ) confirm the validity of all legislation , whether or not it has been interpreted under Section 3 . Section 3 can therefore be said to protect primary legislation which is incompatible , and any secondary legislation made under such primary legislation . 
 = = Interpretation = = 
 Three types of judicial interpretation are commonly identified in the context of section 3 : " reading in " , " reading out " and " reading down " . " Reading in " refers to adding in words that are not present in the statute so as to ensure compliance with Convention rights , and " reading out " removing words in a statute to do so . These processes had already been implemented with reference to the implementation of European legislation , so as to ensure compliance of domestic law with European law . Although accepted with secondary legislation , they remain controversial with primary legislation , since parliament would have included or omitted such words if it had had such an intent ; reading in or out words would therefore conflict with parliamentary intention . Courts have , however , accepted these powers , and during the passing of the Human Rights Act , it was agreed that the courts would have such a power . 
 In R v A , extra provisions were read into a statute to ensure compliance , since the statute itself had the legitimate aim of protecting potential rape victims ; it was merely , in the words of Lord Steyn , that " the methods adopted amounted to legislative overkill " . In Poplar Housing v <unk> , the Court of Appeal rejected the possibility of reading in a provision , because it would have altered the method of remedying the problem to that laid down by Parliament , amounting to starting afresh on how best to approach the issue . Courts have been far more reluctant to read out wording for fear of going against parliamentary intention , but it remains a possibility . 
 " Reading down " involves choosing an interpretation that is compatible , where more than one is strictly possible . For example , placing a persuasive burden of proof on a defendant raising a defence – that he need persuade the jury that it is the case , was judged to be incompatible with Article 6 ( 2 ) of the Convention , which related to the presumption of innocence , which had long been a part of English law in R v Lambert . The court read down the burden of proof as merely one of an evidential burden – meaning the defendant merely had to raise some evidence to support the defence , which it believed did not conflict with Article 6 ( 2 ) . However , in Sheldrake v DPP , the court instead requiring a persuasive burden , because it believed in the context of the motoring offence in the case , this was not disproportionate and did not conflict with Article 6 ( 2 ) . 
 = = Academic commentary = = 
 Before the Human Rights Act was brought before parliament , the government 's whitepaper considered that it was necessary to prevent courts from setting aside legislation on the basis of incompatibility ( reflecting a strong need to respect parliamentary sovereignty ) . However , the effect on parliamentary sovereignty has been criticised despite the safeguards put in place . Section 3 has been defended , however , by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system , prompted by an " incoming tide " of human rights . Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases not a question of parliamentary sovereignty , but a complex question of how far the judiciary can perform a legislative function in that area . She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming to the extent that the concept of parliamentary sovereignty should be " eliminated " . However , other writers have stressed the important of the formal right to ignore either decision . The result of this debate has been to label section 3 either a " radical tool " to implement human rights , or a " <unk> limitation " of Parliament 's will . 
 Geoffrey Marshall has characterised section 3 as a " deeply mysterious provision " in several respects , including judging how strong a provision it is – an issue since dealt with by the courts – but has also noted a disparity between what the Act might be expected to do and what it does . He argues that a litigant would hope that courts would strive to uphold his rights under the Convention , accepting a derivation from them only rarely ; instead section 3 requires courts to find compatibility with the Convention where possible – in other words , to strive to find that the Convention does not impact the claimant . Alison L. Young has examined the upper boundaries to courts ' powers of interpretation . She puts forward three possible limits : firstly , where the text of a statute is not ambiguous ; secondly , where reading in words is inappropriate ; and , thirdly , where any interpretation is restricted to cases where it does not involve implied repeal . Young dismisses the first two as incompatible with the legislative history ( and , in at least the first case , judicial history ) and believes the third to present no rigid limit on courts ' powers at all . The decision of Pepper v Hart provides a method for the legislative history of a bill to play a role in its interpretation . 
 Philip Sales and Richard Ekins are among those that believe that section 3 has not displaced the purpose of interpretation – to discern parliamentary intention . In their eyes , section 3 is about " how interpreters are to infer that intention " . They also criticise the " judicial lawmaking " because it applies to the case in hand , concluding that this breaks the non @-@ retroactivity commonly considered part of the rule of law , although it is sometimes necessary . They also note that rules made by courts are not transparent , because their new interpretation under section 3 differs from their ordinary meaning – after all , section 3 must go beyond standard interpretation . This leaves citizens uncertain of what the law is . Sales and Ekins also suggest that while applying section 3 to post @-@ Human Rights Act legislation might be merely using a presumption that the legislature intended to follow it , applying it to pre @-@ Human Rights Act legislation cannot possibly base itself on such an inference . Section 3 , though , still allows them to do so . 
 Another view is that Section 3 provides a much strengthened basis for the sort of " weak review " – the scope of which carefully determined between courts on one hand and parliament on the other – in a statutory form . There have been at least three criticisms put forward : firstly that the impossibility of implied repeal goes against some formulations of parliamentary sovereignty that require that no parliament can bind a future parliament . Secondly , whether section 3 interpretations follow parliamentary intent is questionable ; thirdly , if it does allow interpretations contrary to intent , section 3 may render section 4 necessary . However , judicial powers are probably not unconstrained . The analysis of what the courts can and cannot do would also provide the answer the third criticism , depending on the viewpoint . Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague , and leading therefore more easily to the imposition of the judiciary on the legal domain of parliament , this viewpoint is controversial : they do not seem to have yet so encroached and there are rules emerging about the application of section 3 . 
 = Patrick Henry College = 
 Patrick Henry College ( PHC ) is a private , independent college with an Evangelical Christian basis that focuses on teaching classical liberal arts and government , located in Purcellville , Virginia , United States . The college is known for its conservative evangelical Christian focus . PHC is accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools , a national faith @-@ related accrediting organization . 
 The school was founded with the help of the Home School Legal Defense Association , and now serves as the headquarters for the organization , with which it is still closely connected . 
 = = History = = 
 Patrick Henry College was incorporated in 1998 by Michael Farris , founder of the Home School Legal Defense Association , who in 1993 , ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor of Virginia . It officially opened September 20 , 2000 , with a class of 92 students . Since then the school has grown to approximately 350 students . The college eschews federal financial aid and is therefore relieved from Department of Education reporting requirements on demographic makeup of its student body and from other federal reporting requirements . The school does not ask for race on applications so the ethnic demographics are unknown . 
 PHC receives all of its funding from tuition fees or donations . The college states that it does not accept any money from <unk> any other source that includes <unk> the authority of its Board of Trustees or conflict with its foundational statements . PHC adds new facilities and programs only as funds are available . The Home School Legal Defense Association is one of the primary benefactors of the school , and all members of the association receive a $ 1300 grant if they are accepted as students . 
 = = = Media attention = = = 
 The school has attracted reports from every major network and cable news organization from its inception , and been the subject of articles in Time , The New Yorker , The Economist , the New York Times , and others . A television documentary about the college , God 's Next Army , aired in the spring of 2006 on Britain 's Channel 4 and on the Discovery Times Channel in the United States . Initial media interest stemmed from the fact that the college deliberately sought students with homeschooled backgrounds . It also attracted attention because a number of the school 's students gained White House internships and opportunities within the George W. Bush administration : in spring 2004 , seven of the 100 student White House interns were from PHC , which had only 240 students at the time . Thats is the same number of interns Georgetown University had during the same period . Hanna Rosin , a writer who has covered religion and politics for several prominent journals , wrote a book entitled , God 's Harvard : A Christian College on a Mission to Save America , published 2007 . In September 2008 , photographer Jona Frank released a second book about Patrick Henry entitled " Right : Portraits of the Evangelical Ivy League , " which features photographic portraits of students and their families . Additionally , the college 's moot court team was the subject of an independent film , Come What May , shot during summer 2007 by a startup Christian production company and marketed primarily to a homeschooling audience . Chancellor Michael Farris appeared on the Colbert Report on October 21 , 2008 . 
 In February 2014 , The New Republic published an article alleging a pattern of pervasive covering up of sexual assault at Patrick Henry College . The article claims that dean Sandra Corbitt and other administrative staff worked to minimize or conceal sexual assault reports and shift blame to victims . The College denies these allegations . Because Patrick Henry College does not accept federal funds , it is not subject to the Clery Act or Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 . 
 = = = Accreditation = = = 
 Patrick Henry College received accreditation in 2007 from the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools , a national accrediting organization for Christian colleges , universities , and seminaries created by the Institute for Creation Research . The college had previously been denied accreditation by the American Academy for Liberal Education in the spring of 2002 because creationism was part of the curriculum . On June 30 , 2005 , the school was officially recognized by the United States Department of Education as an institution eligible for DOE programs . It also allowed students to use more scholarships and grants and made donors and students eligible for various tax benefits . On April 3 , 2012 , the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools reaffirmed Patrick Henry College 's accreditation for a period of ten years . 
 = = Religious affirmations = = 
 All students must sign a " Statement of Faith " before they arrive , affirming belief in what the college considers core Christian doctrines . For example , students are asked to acknowledge " Satan exists as a personal , malevolent being who acts as <unk> and accuser , for whom Hell , the place of eternal punishment , was prepared , where all who die outside of Christ shall be confined in conscious torment for eternity .... Man is by nature sinful and is inherently in need of salvation , which is exclusively found by faith alone in Jesus Christ and His shed blood .... Christ 's death provides substitutionary atonement for our sins . " The college professes non @-@ denominational Christian beliefs , informed by Evangelical Protestantism . 
 Teaching faculty must also sign the Statement of Faith and a more detailed Statement of Biblical Worldview , which represents the college 's requirements for what should be taught . For example the Biblical Worldview Applications states , " Any biology , Bible , or other courses at PHC dealing with creation will teach creation from the understanding of Scripture that God 's creative work , as described in Genesis 1 : 1 – 31 , was completed in six twenty @-@ four @-@ hour days . " 
 In an interview with Fresh Air on National Public Radio , PHC founder Farris commented that the college held the view that its faith was the only true faith ( " we believe that there is truth and there is error " ) and expressed disapproval of religious and social toleration . " Tolerance cannot coexist with liberty " because " the crowd of tolerance wants to ban speech . " 
 On April 12 , 2007 , LGBT rights group Soulforce selected PHC as one of the targets of its annual " Equality Ride , " to protest the stance of conservative Christian colleges concerning homosexuality . Like many other Christian colleges , Patrick Henry did not allow Soulforce to enter the university premises , but the college proposed for student representatives to engage in a formal debate at a neutral location on the merits of the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment to the US Constitution . Soulforce organizers declined and notified the college of their intent to enter the campus to speak directly with students . After being refused entry , Soulforce formed a picket line outside the entrance to the campus and protested for approximately five hours . 
 = = Campus = = 
 Patrick Henry College is located in the town of Purcellville in rural northern Virginia , approximately 40 miles ( 64 km ) northwest of Washington D.C. The campus currently consists of seven buildings arranged around a retention pond popularly called " Lake Bob " , as well as several athletic fields . The oldest structure , Founders Hall , opened in 2000 and contains three classrooms , the college library , and various administrative and faculty offices . It is also home to the offices of the Home School Legal Defense Association . Hanna Rosin , author of God 's Harvard , described the campus as " tiny , less like an Ivy League college than like a Hollywood set of an old Ivy League school . " The buildings are of Colonial Revival architecture . The artwork in Founders Hall consists of copies of portraits of the Founding Fathers placed along a staircase , leading to a picture of Patrick Henry at the second Virginia convention which features a light from heaven guiding Henry 's speech . The artwork is designed to , in the words of Hanna Rosin , " remind the students that America was founded as a Christian nation . " 
 The school 's residential village is composed of five residence halls located along the edges of the lake . There are two men 's dormitories ( Oak Hill and Red Hill ) and three women 's dormitories ( Mount Vernon , Monticello , and Montpelier ) . The four smaller dormitories opened in 2001 , while the largest residence hall , Red Hill , opened in 2003 . In addition to student housing , Red Hill also contains three classrooms and an office suite on its basement level . Located in the basement of Mount Vernon is an auditorium referred to as Town Hall , where the school 's daily chapel sessions and other special events are held . The residence halls are set up in an arc shape around the lake .

 In August 2009 the college opened a $ 32 million , 106 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 9 @,@ 800 m2 ) student life center , which significantly expanded dining , classroom , recreational , and athletic facilities . Construction began in December 2006 and was completed during the summer of 2009 . 
 In November 2007 , the college announced that the student center would be named in honor of trustee Barbara Hodel . On January 21 , 2008 , the college announced that it had received a pledge guaranteeing full funding for the center 's completion , with an anticipated opening date of fall 2009 . According to the college , the guarantee was made " in the form of a ' challenge grant ' meant to enlarge the College ’ s base of existing donors while solidifying the long @-@ term fiscal health of PHC and its annual scholarship program . " In response to the grant , the school initiated a year @-@ long fund raising campaign entitled " Finish the Foundation . " This allowed the college to fund the construction of the building debt @-@ free , pursuant to its policy of not borrowing for capital projects . 
 The Barbara Hodel Center opened for student use at the start of the fall 2009 academic semester , and the gymnasium , new dining hall , and coffee shop opened in October 2009 . On October 10 , 2009 the college held a dedication ceremony for the new building which was attended by approximately 1 @,@ 000 people and featured evangelical leader James Dobson of Focus on the Family as the keynote speaker . After the student center opened , most of the college 's administrative offices moved into the building , allowing more of the office space in Founders Hall to be used by <unk> .

 The college 's founder , Mike Farris , announced his resignation as president of the college on March 6 , 2006 , to become chancellor . Graham Walker , formerly of Oklahoma Wesleyan University and the University of Pennsylvania , served as the second president of the college , from 2006 @-@ 2014 . Jack Haye became the third President of Patrick Henry College in 2015 after thirty years in the banking world . 
 On July 1 , 2006 , the educator and cultural editor of World , Gene Edward <unk> , took the post of academic dean . As part of multiple structural and administrative changes implemented in November 2006 , <unk> was appointed to the position of provost and oversees the departments of Academic Affairs and Student Life . 
 = = Academics = = 
 Students at the school can specialize within one of two schools of study : Government or Classical Liberal Arts . The Government Department offers majors in Government , Journalism , Economics & Business Analytics , and Strategic Intelligence in National Security . The Government major provides an option to specialize in American Politics and Policy , International Politics and Policy , Political Theory , Strategic Intelligence , or a General Government track . The Classical Liberal Arts Department offer degrees in Classical Liberal Arts Education , History , and Literature and Minors in Biblical Studies , Classics , History , Journalism , Music , Pedagogy , and Philosophy . 
 The Government Department 's Public Policy degree was the first one offered by the college , and is still largely seen as its " flagship " program , which until 2009 had connections with the former George W. Bush administration , Washington , D.C. Republicans , and conservative think tanks and organizations . In late November 2006 , the school announced plans to split this track into the separate American Politics and Policy and International Politics and Policy tracks . 
 The college has a 100 % acceptance rate among graduates who have applied to law school . Since its founding in 2000 , the college has graduated over 735 students . At the time of its May 2009 commencement , approximately 92 % of graduating seniors who had applied to graduate school for enrollment in fall 2009 were accepted to one or more schools of their choice . On January 24 , 2007 , the school successfully completed an on @-@ site review by a <unk> assessment team , and was granted full accreditation in April .

 The resignations led to questions about the compatibility of a strong liberal arts education along with its conservative biblical beliefs . David C. Noe , assistant professor of Classics departed after finding that classical works by non @-@ Christian authors were sometimes considered suspect at PHC , and there was an increasingly narrow view of Christianity . Root criticized the autocratic lack of faculty participation in the ideas and governing of the school , saying " if [ PHC ] continues down this road , will end up being more an ' illiberal arts education ' . " All resulting faculty vacancies were filled by the beginning of the fall 2006 semester . In 2007 , however , two more professors announced their resignations , suggesting that academic freedom remained an issue .

 Students are active in multiple campus clubs including the College Republicans , Eden Troupe ( which produces regular stage dramas ) , the Streaming Media Network ( which produces student films ) , and several philosophical and literary societies . 
 In the 2000s Hanna Rosin , author of God 's Harvard , said that " never would you find a group of better @-@ behaved teenagers than on the campus of Patrick Henry . " During that period many Patrick Henry students made fun of Bob Jones University , which Rosin described as having " the gold standard of vice patrol . " Rosin commented that " by most people 's standards , " Patrick Henry " was not far behind " Bob Jones .

Moot court is a form of debate competition designed to simulate appellate arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court , in which teams of two students function as co @-@ counsels and stand before a panel of judges to argue legal matters . In 2006 , PHC not only won first overall but also won second , third , and fifth place , a feat that had never before been accomplished in ACMA history . Likewise , in 2006 , the college took home the most trophies out of any school for the fifth consecutive year . In a much publicized event during the 2004 – 2005 academic year , the college moot court team defeated that of Balliol College , Oxford in two separate competitions – one held in England using English law , and the other in the USA using American law . Patrick Henry College also has participated in British Parliamentary debate since the fall of 2010 .

 = Britney ( album ) = 
 Britney is the self @-@ titled third studio album by American singer Britney Spears . It was released on November 5 , 2001 , by JIVE Records . Looking to transition from the teen pop styles of her earlier albums ... Baby One More Time ( 1999 ) and Oops ! ... I Did It Again ( 2000 ) , Spears began to embrace a more mature sound with her next studio effort . Its music incorporates genres of pop and dance @-@ pop with influences of R & B and occasionally dips into elements of disco , hip hop and rock ; its lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood and sexuality . Contributions to its production came from a variety of collaborators , including Max Martin and Rami Yacoub . Spears herself assumed a more prominent role in the album 's development , co @-@ writing five of its tracks . 
 Upon its release , Britney received generally mixed reviews from music critics , who complimented the progression from Spears 's earlier works , but criticized her increasingly provocative image . The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first @-@ week sales of 745 @,@ 000 copies . Its success made Spears the first female artist to have her first three albums debut atop the chart , a record she would later break again with her fourth record In the Zone ( 2003 ) . To promote the album , Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour , which began in November 2001 and continued through July 2002 . The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album . 
 Six singles were released from the album , all of which proved less successful than those of Spears 's prior records . Consequentially , Britney became her first record not to yield a US Billboard Hot 100 top 20 hit . Its lead single " I 'm a Slave 4 U " peaked at number twenty @-@ seven on the chart , while follow @-@ up singles " Overprotected " , " I 'm Not a Girl , Not Yet a Woman " , " I Love Rock ' n ' Roll " , " Anticipating " , and " Boys " reached the lower end of the chart and its extension , the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles .

 In May 2000 , Spears released her second studio album Oops ! ... I Did It Again . Spears collaborated with producers including Rodney Jerkins , David Kreuger , and Max Martin . Following its release , Oops ! ... I Did It Again became an international success and peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200 . The album 's lead single " Oops ! ... I Did It Again " became one of the best @-@ selling singles of all time . 
 When recording her follow @-@ up record , Spears wanted an " older generation to pick up on it " , adding that she " had to change it up and pray people think that 's cool " . She stated that she chose to self @-@ title the album because the majority of its content describes who she is . Spears recorded twenty @-@ three tracks for the release , several of which she co @-@ wrote with the assistance of Brian Kierulf and Josh Schwartz . She added that personally writing the album and developing its concept made the project " that much more special " , elaborating of her intentions to " get better and grow " as a songwriter . 
 Spears worked with a variety of collaborators , including pop colleagues Martin and her then @-@ boyfriend Justin Timberlake . She commented that she initially felt " awkward " and " nervous " working with Timberlake , saying that she was accustomed to the process being " like work " . Spears also worked with hip hop producers Rodney Jerkins and The Neptunes , who made the record " nastier and funkier " . She additionally recorded songs with Missy Elliott and Timbaland , but their tracks never made the final track listing due to scheduling conflicts .

 Britney incorporates pop styles with elements of dance @-@ pop and R & B. The album opens with its lead single " I 'm a Slave 4 U " . The song features an urban influence and Middle Eastern flavor , amid breathy , emotive noises , and it has been compared to " Nasty Girl " by Vanity 6 . Spears commented that its lyrics are " about me just wanting to go out and forget who I am and dance and have a good time " . " Overprotected " was noted for having Europop styles , and addresses a girl who is tired of being manipulated . Lyrically , " Lonely " sees a girl moving on from a troublesome romance after being lied to and manipulated . It was considered " a teenage version of Janet 's " What About ? " . The soft rock piano ballad " I 'm Not a Girl , Not Yet a Woman " , co @-@ penned by English singer @-@ songwriter Dido , Max Martin and Rami , details the emotional struggles that teenage girls experience during puberty . " Boys " incorporates R & B and hip hop styles , and was criticized by David Browne of Entertainment Weekly as " cut @-@ rate ' 80s Janet Jackson " . The disco @-@ inspired track " Anticipating " discusses the friendship and camaraderie between women , and it 's reminiscent of [ Madonna 's ] ' Holiday ' or Kylie in disco mood . " 
 Spears 's cover of " I Love Rock ' n ' Roll " , made famous by Joan Jett and the <unk> , infuses pop rock styles into the original hard rock rendition . " Cinderella " reflects on a girl who left her boyfriend after he failed to appreciate her efforts in the relationship . " Let Me Be " sees Spears ask to be trusted as an adult and be afforded her own opinions . " Bombastic Love " discusses a love where Spears feels that the romance will happen " exactly like in a movie " . Similarly , the penultimate track " That 's Where You Take Me " details the joy she gets from an emotionally fulfilling relationship , amid Middle Eastern chimes and a collage of electronic beats and drum programming . In some editions , " When I Found You " is the penultimate track . On the track , Britney tells she has found her " deepest love " in her soul mate who is essentially a reflection of herself . The album closes with " What It 's Like to Be Me " , which was co @-@ written and co @-@ produced by Spears 's then @-@ boyfriend Justin Timberlake ; Spears sings that a guy must " figure [ her ] out " to " be [ her ] man " .

PopMatters ' Nikki <unk> complimented the production of the songs , but questioned if Spears was ready to establish herself as a grown woman in the music industry . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine agreed , writing that although " Britney , [ the album ] , fills her role of guilty pleasure ( the disc certainly <unk> more than the stunted growth of last year 's Oops ! ...

 = Die Another Day ( song ) = 
 " Die Another Day " is the theme song from the James Bond film of the same name by American singer and songwriter Madonna . The song initially leaked into the internet in early October 2002 prior to the official release , prompting radio to play the track . It was released commercially as a single on October 22 by Maverick Records and was later included on the singer 's ninth studio album , American Life ( 2003 ) , and her greatest hits compilation , Celebration ( 2009 ) . Following the release of the previous Bond single , " The World Is Not Enough " , MGM wanted a high @-@ profile artist for the theme of Die Another Day and Madonna was their choice . She wrote and produced the song with Mirwais Ahmadzaï while French composer Michel Colombier was enlisted as composer . 
 While developing , the track went through numerous changes . After Madonna saw the initial version of the film she adapted the song to its theme , described as a metaphor for destroying one 's ego . Ahmadzaï re @-@ arranged " Die Another Day " at his home in Paris while Colombier finished the string sections in Los Angeles . An electroclash number , " Die Another Day " is a mixture of strings and interpolating electronic swirls , and stuttered editing on Madonna 's voice , cutting the main signal on the chorus . 
 " Die Another Day " received mixed responses from music critics ; one group of reviewers favored its departure from traditional Bond soundtracks , while others panned its production and called it uninteresting . It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and two Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording and Best Short Form Music Video . The song was a commercial success , peaking at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was the top selling dance song in the US for both 2002 and 2003 . " Die Another Day " reached the top of the charts in Canada , Italy , Romania and Spain and top @-@ ten in a number of countries worldwide . 
 The music video was directed by Traktor , and was developed as an independent video from the film but contained Bond influences . It depicts Madonna as a prisoner in a torture chamber , alternating with scenes of a fencing duel between good ( clad in white ) and evil ( clad in black ) personas of the singer . Wounds inflicted on both fencers are mirrored on the imprisoned Madonna , and in the end she escapes being electrocuted in the chamber . The usage of Jewish religious texts and objects in the music video led to controversy , with Judaism scholars deeming it sacrilegious . Madonna has included the song on two of her world tours ; the first being the 2004 Re @-@ Invention World Tour and again as a video interlude on the 2008 – 09 Sticky & Sweet Tour . 
 = = Background and conception = = 
 After the September 11 attacks , Madonna was in an introspective mood and started writing songs for her next studio album , American Life , with producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï . Recording started in late 2001 but was put on hold as Madonna shot for her film Swept Away in Malta , and also starred in the West End play , Up For Grabs . In the meantime , Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer ( MGM ) was filming the twentieth James Bond film , Die Another Day , directed by Lee Tamahori . The previous film in the franchise , The World is Not Enough ( 1999 ) was a box office success earning US $ 362 million worldwide . However , the eponymous soundtrack single by alternative rock group Garbage failed to gain commercial success in the United States . The music management at MGM went to look for a high @-@ profile artist to write and perform the title song for Die Another Day . 
 Madonna was their first choice , since she had been successful with soundtrack singles in the US , most recently with " Beautiful Stranger " ( 1999 ) from Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me which was a top @-@ twenty hit and earned her a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media . Anita <unk> , executive vice president of MGM Music explained the choice in 2002 : " With every other artist , you 're taking a chance . But with Madonna , she has an extraordinary track record . She has written songs for films before and they were always perfect . " By mid @-@ February 2002 sources from the film set revealed that negotiations were under process for Madonna to sing the title song and make a cameo appearance in Die Another Day . The song deal was confirmed in mid @-@ March with journalists reporting a complex contract which might have cost MGM around one million dollars , including Madonna 's fees for music and acting , promotion , the single release and the music video . 
 = = Writing and development = = 
 According to MTV News , work began on the song following the announcement , with French composer Michel Colombier being confirmed as the strings conductor . Colombier had worked with Madonna and Ahmadzaï on her single " Don 't Tell Me " from Music . Madonna and Ahmadzaï went through their demo tracks for American Life and zeroed on one of the songs for the film . They sent the demo to MGM describing it as " this techno thing , an electronica piece rewritten to accommodate the film and the title " . According to Colombier , the studio responded positively to the demo but wanted them to change it so that it blended with traditional James Bond music in some way . 
 The track went through various interpolations , according to executive producer of the film , Michael G. Wilson . Madonna 's publicist Liz Rosenberg had initially confirmed that the title of the song might not be same as the film , however Wilson explained that when the singer " saw the rough [ film ] we were going to use , she sort of adapted the song and changed the title to ' Die Another Day ' . " Tamahori was concerned with the demo since it did not appear expressive to him and there were abrupt endings . However he was satisfied when Madonna re @-@ wrote the chorus to make it suitable for the film . The writing process was explained by Madonna : 
 I hemmed and <unk> about it for a while because just for that reason though . Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie , and I never liked to do what everybody else likes to do . It 's just some perverse thing in me , right ? So , but then I thought about it and I said , you know what ? James Bond needs to get – needs to get techno so ... 
 Used in the opening sequence , " Die Another Day " was played 13 minutes into the film , where Bond is shown imprisoned and being tortured for over a year in a prison camp in Korea . Being a departure from the normal title sequence of the previous Bond films , Madonna faced difficulty in making the song blend with the theme of Die Another Day . Nevertheless , she understood the idea behind the opening scenes and tweaked the song accordingly . Some of the lyrics like " I 'm gonna destroy my ego ... Sigmund Freud ... Analyze this " were derived from Madonna 's interpretation of the film 's storyline . She told an interviewer from Genre magazine that the lyrics were about " destroying your ego , and it 's juxtaposing the metaphor of , you know , the fight against good and bad , and it 's set inside the whole universe of Bond " . " Die Another Day " was never adapted into the main score of the film . The song was later added to the track list of American Life and was also featured on her third greatest hits album , Celebration ( 2009 ) . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 Once the song structure was finished , MGM sent Colombier in Los Angeles a rough edit of the opening sequence of the film , while Ahmadzaï sent him a longer version of the demo . Colombier had to create something inline the film score with " Die Another Day " . He added some more lyrics and then went to London to conduct an ensemble of 60 string players at AIR Lyndhurst Studios . Ahmadzaï , who was already mixing and recording the other tracks for American Life , explained that the process " was often laborious but with a less @-@ is @-@ more philosophy that is reflected in the music 's sparse arrangements . " They wanted minimalist production for the song , but at the same time make them sound " futuristic " . 
 After the orchestra sections were done , Ahmadzaï took the track back to his home in Paris and did a complete re @-@ arrangement . String engineer Geoff Foster recalled that Madonna wanted something " big and brass " which Ahmadzaï denied , since Madonna had already done that with her 1998 single , " Frozen " . Colombier explained that the final version was not the way he had structured the song , it was according to Ahmadzaï 's mixing and ideas . " He 's a master manipulator . Sixty real strings , played live , became audio files in his computer . They can be chopped like real pieces of fabric . He 's amazingly brilliant with that , " concluded Colombier . Madonna attended the recording sessions at Olympic Studios in London . There was a tango section in the song which Colombier recalled was composed perfectly during rehearsals . But during the actual recording it did not work out as expected , prompting Madonna to grab the talkback mic and telling the crew , " It 's not sexy enough , think about sex ! " 
 " Die Another Day " is an electroclash number , starting with strings which continues for eleven seconds , when Madonna 's vocals starts with the lines " I 'm gonna keep this secret / I 'm gonna close my body now ... " It follows with the stuttered editing on her voice , which keeps cutting the main signal , especially on the chorus " I guess .. I would die ... another day " . The strings again gain prominence at around the 2 : 20 mark . During the intermediate verse , a " raucous " laugh by Madonna can be heard . The song ends with interpolating electronic swirls and the orchestra fading out . Sterling Clover from The Village Voice explained that the ending recalled the snare drums and bass usage in songs of the <unk> genre , describing it as " cacophony of harmonic fragments " . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com , the song is set in the time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 130 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of C minor with Madonna 's voice spanning from the nodes of B3 and D ♯ 5 . " Die Another Day " follows a basic sequence of Cm – G ♯ – Cm – B ♭ – Cm as its chord progression .

 " Die Another Day " was officially released in United States on October 22 , 2002 . It was supposed to be released on October 10 , but got leaked a week prior to that to the radio stations . Website Hollywood.com reported that " Madonna and members of her camp were beside themselves when the song — which they claim wasn 't even finished — aired on a pop station in New York City . " 
 The song received mixed reviews from music critics . Author Lucy O 'Brien wrote in her biography , Madonna : Like an Icon , that the techno composition and the stuttering vocals made the song " an almost anti @-@ Bond theme " . James Hannaham from Spin was positive in his review , writing that it is a " brilliant , melodramatic song , that sounds like a stoic response to a world gone mad . " Writing for Yahoo ! Music , Dan Gennoe felt that since the songs in American Life mostly gave prominence to style over substance , " Die Another Day " as a result had become one @-@ dimensional . Stylus Magazine 's Ed Howard described the song as " a great slice @-@ and @-@ dice hit of fucked @-@ up electroclash " , in an otherwise negative review for American Life . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine considered it " forward @-@ thinking " and believed that the record was added to American Life 's track list to ensure that the album would not be devoid of a hit song . Clover described the track as " A blistering zeitgeist @-@ negation , hostile and uneasy — as a single , a club track , a Bond theme . " Chuck Taylor from Billboard was positive in his response , saying that the electronic effects rendered Madonna 's vocals as non @-@ discernible but the composition was forward thinking from Music ( 2000 ) , her eighth studio album . 
 In his book Madonna : The Complete Guide to Her Music , author Rikky Rooksby described it as " melodically uninteresting and harmonically repetitious " . He felt that the stuttered editing by Ahmadzai did not allow the song to gain its full potential but complimented the strings and the chords . Rooksby concluded by saying that " Die Another Day " reveals much about the decline in songwriting quality from the early Bond songs and was not much of an improvement over " The World is Not Enough " ; he said that the Sigmund Freud line was the " wittiest line " on the whole of American Life album . Writing for The A.V. Club , Stephen Thompson called the track " pneumatic " and " hook @-@ deficient " . Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly criticized the song as a " flat James Bond tune " adding that it failed to become a " Madonna classic " . Both Manohla Dargis from Los Angeles Times and Joe Morgenstern from The Wall Street Journal panned the song calling it " dumb " . Variety 's Todd McCarthy called the song " banal " . A. O. Scott from The New York Times described Madonna 's vocals as " electronically enhanced chirps " while reviewing Die Another Day . 
 The song was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Original Song , but lost to U2 's " The Hands That Built America " from Gangs of New York . At the 46th Grammy Awards , it was nominated in the categories of Best Dance Recording and Best Short Form Music Video , but lost both awards ; the former to Kylie Minogue 's " Come Into My World " and the latter to Johnny Cash 's " Hurt " . " Die Another Day " was also nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song of 2002 while Madonna herself won the trophy of Worst Supporting Actress for her cameo in the film . In a MORI poll for the Channel 4 TV show James Bond 's Greatest Hits , the song was voted the ninth best out of 22 , but also came in as an " overwhelming number one " favorite among those under the age of 24 . Rock music critic Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph named it the fifth best James Bond theme song , describing " Die Another Day " as an electro R & B workout which was " expressively weird , brutally modern , satisfyingly original and evocative of the dark heart of Bond . Plus , Madonna actually looks as if she might be a match for Bond in either bed or battlefield . Or both . " Rolling Stone listed it as the seventh best Bond song in the magazine 's list of " The top 10 James Bond Theme Songs " .

 After its release to radio in United States , " Die Another Day " started receiving strong airplay at the major US radio stations , having been spun for more than 100 times . The song garnered 35 million audience impressions in its first week , debuting at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 , the highest debut of the year . It also debuted at number 19 on the Mainstream Top 40 , number 40 on the Adult Top 40 and number 42 on the Hot 100 Airplay charts . The next week the song continued its ascent up the airplay charts , while reaching number 28 on the Hot 100 and becoming the " breakout " track on the Hot Dance Music / Club Play chart . The release of the CD single on October 22 , 2002 , prompted the song to jump from position 18 to number eight on the Hot 100 , thus becoming Madonna 's 35th top @-@ ten single on the chart . This feat put her ahead of The Beatles ' 34 top @-@ ten hits and one behind tying Elvis Presley 's record as the artist with the most top @-@ ten singles on the Hot 100 . The move was spurred by sales of 28 @,@ 500 units of the CD which also put it on the top of Hot 100 Singles , becoming her third number one on the chart . 
 " Die Another Day " was the highest charting James Bond song in the US since Duran Duran 's number @-@ one single , " A View to Kill " ( 1985 ) . It was also Madonna 's highest charting song since " Don 't Tell Me " peaked at number four in February 2001 , and was her 44th top @-@ forty single — the most for any artist — breaking the tie with Aretha Franklin 's 43 entries . The single spent 11 weeks at number one on Hot 100 Singles , becoming her most successful entry on that chart . " Die Another Day " became the best selling dance single of both 2002 and 2003 and the fifth best @-@ selling dance single of the 2000s decade in the US . Additionally , Billboard also declared " Die Another Day " as Madonna 's 33rd most successful single on the Hot 100 . According to Nielsen SoundScan , the song has sold 184 @,@ 000 digital downloads as of April 2010 , making it one of her best selling titles released before 2005 , the year when downloads began contributing into calculating the ranks on Billboard Hot 100 . 
 In Canada , the song debuted at number 25 on the Canadian Singles Chart , and ultimately reached the top , staying there for four weeks . The song was certified double platinum by the Music Canada ( MC ) for shipment of 200 @,@ 000 copies . In Australia , the song debuted and peaked at number 11 on the Australian Singles Chart , staying for a total of 19 weeks and obtaining a gold from the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) for shipment of 35 @,@ 000 copies of the single . It was less successful in New Zealand , where it debuted and peaked at number 22 on the RIANZ Singles Chart , staying for a total of three weeks . 
 In the United Kingdom , " Die Another Day " entered the UK Singles Chart at number three on November 3 , 2002 , being kept from the top spot by DJ Sammy 's remix of Bryan Adams ' 1985 single , " Heaven " , and the song " Dilemma " by rapper Nelly featuring Kelly Rowland . Next week the song dropped to number 12 , and continued its descent ultimately staying for a total of 16 weeks on the chart . In September 2015 , the song was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) for selling over 200 @,@ 000 copies . It was listed as the 80th best selling single of 2002 in UK . The single was successful in Europe , reaching the top @-@ ten of the charts in Austria , Belgium ( both Flanders and Wallonia ) , Denmark , Finland , Germany , Greece , Netherlands , Norway , Sweden and Switzerland , while topping the charts in Italy and Spain . In France the song achieved silver certification from the Syndicat National de l 'Édition Phonographique ( SNEP ) for shipping 125 @,@ 000 copies of the single .

 The music video was directed by Traktor , a Swedish directing team known for several TV advertisements . It was filmed from August 22 – 27 , 2002 at Hollywood Center Studios in Hollywood , California . The total production costs for the video was around $ 6 @.@ 1 million ( $ 8 @.@ 03 million in 2016 dollars ) , making it the second most expensive music video ever made , after " Scream " by Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson . In an interview with Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet , Ole Sanders from Traktor recalled that in May 2002 Madonna sent them a handwritten letter , along with a demo version of " Die Another Day " . The team was in Prague , shooting a music video for The Prodigy . " We thought it was a joke , since the letter was long and handwritten . But the song sounded suspiciously like her , " Sanders explained . He was then asked to go to Pinewood Studios in London to watch a half @-@ finished version of the Bond film with producer Barbara Broccoli . Later , Sanders and one of his colleagues invited Madonna to their London home to discuss the video . By summer 2002 , he had compiled the idea for the video with Madonna 's inputs in it : 
 We received daily e @-@ mails with feedback that was concise , unambiguous and occasionally entertaining . She works extremely hard with gumption and detail , and it was clear to us how she has remained on top for twenty years . It was no use being unprepared with vague ideas disguised as creativity , and there was no place to hide ... First it felt like doing nonsense , then it 's fun and it 's something that 's going to be seen . The project brings us into contact with interesting actors within both film and music . 
 The video was developed as an independent Madonna clip devoid of any footage from the Bond film , but was still Bond @-@ inspired . It portrayed Madonna in a torture chamber as a prisoner and also fight sequences where the singer duels with herself . Post @-@ production and visual effects for the video was done by London 's Moving Picture Company ( MPC ) . They created " invisible " effects for the fighting sequences , allowing Madonna to shoot two characters . Traktor explained that every shot of the video used some visual effects , co @-@ ordinated by the group 's lead artist , Christophe Allender . The directors did not want to use too many shots for the dueling scenes , which they believed would have restricted their creative freedom . Additional post @-@ production effects included composing the fight sequence as a cohesive theme , adding blood to the wounds inflicted on Madonna , and adding digital stills of windows against the greenscreen where the shots were taken . The final shot showed the characteristic gun barrel sequence from the Bond films . MPC artist Ziggy <unk> used a 2K resolution shot and tailored it according to Traktor 's specifications . Finally , instead of grading the film print , MPC used the negatives to achieve crisper and cleaner images . 
 The premiere of the video took place on MTV channels worldwide on October 22 , 2002 , a first occurrence in the music channel 's history . The music video was included in the enhanced CD of the single , along with the " Making of the video " . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The music video begins with a bruised Madonna being dragged by two soldiers through a dark corridor , and thrown against a chair in a torture chamber . She starts singing the first verse of the song as her captors laugh at her . An alternate scene shows two people fencing inside a white lit chamber , one in black cloths and one in white . Madonna continues groping with the different objects in the torture chamber and dancing . As she repeats the words " Sigmund Freud " , the soldiers catch her again and douse her head in icy @-@ water . 
 The two people fencing take off their masks , both are revealed to be Madonna and are surprised to see each other ; they resume their violent fighting . The black Madonna slices across the white Madonna 's stomach , which is mirrored in the imprisoned Madonna 's stomach in the chamber . She rides on a hanging chain from the ceiling and smashes a mirror across the wall . The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna against the wall . Different artifacts from the Bond films are present in the room and the two Madonna 's fight through them . Meanwhile , the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding behind an electric chair . 
 As the breakdown happens , the soldiers bind her on the chair but she laughs , kicks and spits on them . Midst the aggressive fighting , the white Madonna takes a crossbow and shoots the black Madonna squarely on the chest . The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair . They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears , they see that no remnants are to be found . They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters ( <unk> ) being burnt in the chair . They scratch their head and see a vision of a bearded man laughing at them . Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door , as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence . 
 = = = Reception and analysis = = = 
 According to author Santiago Fouz @-@ Hernández , the video employed an identity @-@ splitting strategy in which the two Madonnas fight each other . With this she was referencing her previous videos where such tactics have been employed , like the one for " Music " , " Papa Don 't Preach " and " Human Nature " . Joanna <unk> , one of the authors of the book Representing Gender In Cultures analyzed that the violent imagery in the video was Madonna 's way of portraying the violence she had faced during her " tumultuous " marriage with actor Sean Penn ; she added that the video was a contrast to the " tremendously independent artist she is " . The end of the video sparked discussion about the words imprinted on the electric chair , a phrase that can be interpreted as " great escape " or " freedom " . According to The Sydney Morning Herald , some scholars of Judaism were riled by the Jewish religious texts and objects appearing in the video . One of Madonna 's Kabbalah advisors , Michael Berg , explained that " Hebrew letters Madonna displays , lamed , aleph , <unk> — roughly equivalent to L , A , V — form one of the 72 names of God and denote a diminishing of the ego to connect with joy and fulfillment . " According to him , donning tefillin represented " diminution of the desire to receive and a strengthening of the desire to share . But for a woman to don tefillin is still not a common practice , and for a gentile to wear tefillin might be regarded by some Jews as sacrilege . " 
 In 2004 , the singer was to visit Israel regarding her Kabbalah practice . However , ultra @-@ orthodox Jews protested her trip , saying that Madonna disgraced the religion with her portrayal of wearing phylacteries / tefillin over her arm — a Jewish custom usually reserved for men — in the music video . Israeli securities had advised the singer not to make the trip , but the singer continued her visit to the graves of Jewish sages as well as shrines such as Rachel 's Tomb on the edge of Bethlehem , traditional burial place of the biblical matriarch Rachel . " Die Another Day " was nominated for Best Video from a Film at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards , but lost . It won the " Soundtrack Video of the Year " trophy at the 2003 MVPA Awards .

 Initial reports by The Observer suggested that Madonna would perform " Die Another Day " in front of Queen Elizabeth II at the premiere of the film in London 's Royal Albert Hall , but it did not happen . It was not until two years later she first performed " Die Another Day " , as part of her 2004 Re @-@ Invention World Tour . The song was to be included as the final performance in the set list , but " Holiday " was chosen instead and " Die Another Day " was included in the third segment of the show . Wearing a circus @-@ themed corset designed by Chanel , she and her dancers performed a Tango @-@ like choreography to the song , while backdrops displayed an old man in his deathbed . The performance was received favorably by Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe , who explained that " the abstract ballroom choreography of ' Die Another Day ' was an elegant antidote to the rote gyrations favored by the next generation of pop stars . " Towards the end of the performance , Madonna 's dancers tied the singer on an electric chair and as it was raised high above the stage , she started singing " Lament " from Evita . The performance of " Die Another Day " was included on Madonna 's documentary live album I 'm Going to Tell You a Secret ( 2006 ) , which chronicled the tour . 
 Four years later , " Die Another Day " was added to the set list of the 2008 @-@ 09 Sticky & Sweet Tour , where it was used as a video interlude . It featured Madonna as a boxer on screen , while two of her dancers performed a faux boxing match . The video also showed Madonna in a technical knockout match , spraying her blood across the screen . Madonna 's DJ <unk> remixed the song and the performance ended with the singer falling down on the ground in the video , as she emerged from beneath the stage while jump @-@ roping . Paul Schrodt from Slant Magazine felt that the video emphasized the singer 's " already @-@ muscular arms " , adding that " [ u ] <unk> your run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill diva , Madonna is willing to get dirty for her art , and she sometimes gets lost in her backup dancers ' routine , though she 's quick to remind the audience , ' I 'm still the one in control ' " . Ben Kaplan from Canada.com noted that " Die Another Day " , along with the performances of " 4 Minutes " and " La Isla Bonita " are re @-@ imagined as " parts of larger medleys , with Madonna giving shout @-@ outs to techno , flamenco and old @-@ school R & B influences " . This performance was included on the Sticky & Sweet Tour live CD and DVD release , recorded during Madonna 's shows in Buenos Aires , Argentina , in December 2008 . 
 While on The MDNA Tour on 2012 , Madonna performed an exclusive club date at L 'Olympia in Paris for only 2 @,@ 700 fans and mixed " Die Another Day " with the song " Beautiful Killer " from her twelfth studio album MDNA . After finishing the performance of " Human Nature " , Madonna wears a coat and as the opening music of " Die Another Day " starts , she wields a gun and launches into " Beautiful Killer " . Excerpts of films by French actor Alain Delon — the main inspiration behind " Beautiful Killer " — was shown in the back drops . The mash @-@ up was only performed on this date of the tour .

 = Cygnus X @-@ 1 = 
 Cygnus X @-@ 1 ( abbreviated Cyg X @-@ 1 ) is a well @-@ known galactic X @-@ ray source , thought to be a black hole , in the constellation Cygnus . It was discovered in 1964 during a rocket flight and is one of the strongest X @-@ ray sources seen from Earth , producing a peak X @-@ ray flux density of 2 @.@ 3 × 10 − 23 Wm − 2 Hz − 1 ( 2 @.@ 3 × 103 Jansky ) . Cygnus X @-@ 1 was the first X @-@ ray source widely accepted to be a black hole and it remains among the most studied astronomical objects in its class . The compact object is now estimated to have a mass about 14 @.@ 8 times the mass of the Sun and has been shown to be too small to be any known kind of normal star , or other likely object besides a black hole . If so , the radius of its event horizon is about 44 km . 
 Cygnus X @-@ 1 belongs to a high @-@ mass X @-@ ray binary system about <unk> ly from the Sun that includes a blue supergiant variable star designated HDE 226868 which it orbits at about 0 @.@ 2 AU , or 20 % of the distance from the Earth to the Sun . A stellar wind from the star provides material for an accretion disk around the X @-@ ray source . Matter in the inner disk is heated to millions of degrees , generating the observed X @-@ rays . A pair of jets , arranged perpendicular to the disk , are carrying part of the energy of the infalling material away into interstellar space . 
 This system may belong to a stellar association called Cygnus OB3 , which would mean that Cygnus X @-@ 1 is about five million years old and formed from a progenitor star that had more than 40 solar masses . The majority of the star 's mass was shed , most likely as a stellar wind . If this star had then exploded as a supernova , the resulting force would most likely have ejected the remnant from the system . Hence the star may have instead collapsed directly into a black hole . 
 Cygnus X @-@ 1 was the subject of a friendly scientific wager between physicists Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne in 1975 , with Hawking betting that it was not a black hole . He conceded the bet in 1990 after observational data had strengthened the case that there was indeed a black hole in the system . This hypothesis has not been confirmed due to a lack of direct observation but has generally been accepted from indirect evidence . 
 = = Discovery and observation = = 
 Observation of X @-@ ray emissions allows astronomers to study celestial phenomena involving gas with temperatures in the millions of degrees . However , because X @-@ ray emissions are blocked by the Earth 's atmosphere , observation of celestial X @-@ ray sources is not possible without lifting instruments to altitudes where the X @-@ rays can penetrate . Cygnus X @-@ 1 was discovered using X @-@ ray instruments that were carried aloft by a sounding rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico . As part of an ongoing effort to map these sources , a survey was conducted in 1964 using two Aerobee suborbital rockets . The rockets carried Geiger counters to measure X @-@ ray emission in wavelength range 1 – 15 Å across an 8 @.@ 4 ° section of the sky . These instruments swept across the sky as the rockets rotated , producing a map of closely spaced scans . 
 As a result of these surveys , eight new sources of cosmic X @-@ rays were discovered , including Cyg XR @-@ 1 ( later Cyg X @-@ 1 ) in the constellation Cygnus the swan . The celestial coordinates of this source were estimated as right ascension <unk> and declination 34 @.@ 6 ° . It was not associated with any especially prominent radio or optical source at that position . 
 Seeing a need for longer duration studies , in 1963 Riccardo Giacconi and Herb Gursky proposed the first orbital satellite to study X @-@ ray sources . NASA launched their Uhuru satellite in 1970 , which led to the discovery of 300 new X @-@ ray sources . Extended Uhuru observations of Cygnus X @-@ 1 showed fluctuations in the X @-@ ray intensity that occurs several times a second . This rapid variation meant that the energy generation must take place over a relatively small region of roughly 105 km , as the speed of light restricts communication between more distant regions . For a size comparison , the diameter of the Sun is about 1 @.@ 4 × 106 km . 
 In April – May 1971 , Luc Braes and George K. Miley from Leiden Observatory , and independently Robert M. <unk> and Campbell Wade at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory , detected radio emission from Cygnus X @-@ 1 , and their accurate radio position pinpointed the X @-@ ray source to the star <unk> + 35 1910 = HDE 226868 . On the celestial sphere , this star lies about half a degree from the 4th magnitude star Eta Cygni . It is a supergiant star that is , by itself , incapable of emitting the observed quantities of X @-@ rays . Hence , the star must have a companion that could heat gas to the millions of degrees needed to produce the radiation source for Cygnus X @-@ 1 . 
 Louise Webster and Paul Murdin , at the Royal Greenwich Observatory , and Charles Thomas Bolton , working independently at the University of Toronto 's David Dunlap Observatory , announced the discovery of a massive hidden companion to HDE 226868 in 1971 . Measurements of the Doppler shift of the star 's spectrum demonstrated the companion 's presence and allowed its mass to be estimated from the orbital parameters . Based on the high predicted mass of the object , they surmised that it may be a black hole as the largest possible neutron star cannot exceed three times the mass of the Sun . 
 With further observations strengthening the evidence , by the end of 1973 the astronomical community generally conceded that Cygnus X @-@ 1 was most likely a black hole . More precise measurements of Cygnus X @-@ 1 demonstrated variability down to a single millisecond . This interval is consistent with turbulence in a disk of accreted matter surrounding a black hole — the accretion disk . X @-@ ray bursts that last for about a third of a second match the expected time frame of matter falling toward a black hole . 
 Cygnus X @-@ 1 has since been studied extensively using observations by orbiting and ground @-@ based instruments . The similarities between the emissions of X @-@ ray binaries such as HDE 226868 / Cygnus X @-@ 1 and active galactic nuclei suggests a common mechanism of energy generation involving a black hole , an orbiting accretion disk and associated jets . For this reason , Cygnus X @-@ 1 is identified among a class of objects called microquasars ; an analog of the quasars , or quasi @-@ stellar radio sources , now known to be distant active galactic nuclei . Scientific studies of binary systems such as HDE 226868 / Cygnus X @-@ 1 may lead to further insights into the mechanics of active galaxies . 
 = = Star system = = 
 The compact object and blue supergiant star form a binary system in which they orbit around their center of mass every 5 @.@ <unk> days . From the perspective of the Earth , the compact object never goes behind the other star ; in other words , the system does not eclipse . However , the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight from the Earth remains uncertain , with predictions ranging from 27 – 65 ° . A 2007 study estimated the inclination is 48 @.@ 0 ± 6 @.@ 8 ° , which would mean that the semi @-@ major axis is about 0 @.@ 2 AU , or 20 % of the distance from the Earth to the Sun . The orbital eccentricity is thought to be only 0 @.@ <unk> ± 0 @.@ 002 ; a nearly circular orbit . Earth 's distance to this system is about 1 @,@ 860 ± 120 parsecs ( 6 @,@ 070 ± 390 light @-@ years ) . 
 The HDE 226868 / Cygnus X @-@ 1 system shares a common motion through space with an association of massive stars named Cygnus OB3 , which is located at roughly 2000 parsecs from the Sun . This implies that HDE 226868 , Cygnus X @-@ 1 and this OB association may have formed at the same time and location . If so , then the age of the system is about 5 ± 1 @.@ 5 Ma . The motion of HDE 226868 with respect to Cygnus OB3 is 9 ± 3 km / s ; a typical value for random motion within a stellar association . HDE 226868 is about 60 parsecs from the center of the association , and could have reached that separation in about 7 ± 2 Ma — which roughly agrees with estimated age of the association . 
 With a galactic latitude of 4 degrees and galactic longitude 71 degrees , this system lies inward along the same Orion Spur in which the Sun is located within the Milky Way , near where the spur approaches the Sagittarius Arm . Cygnus X @-@ 1 has been described as belonging to the Sagittarius Arm , though the structure of the Milky Way is not well established . 
 = = = Compact object = = = 
 There is some uncertainty about the mass of the compact object . Stellar evolutionary models suggest a mass of 20 ± 5 solar masses , while other techniques resulted in 10 solar masses . Measuring <unk> in the X @-@ ray emission near the object has yielded a more precise value of 14 @.@ 8 ± 1 solar masses . In all cases , the object is most likely a black hole — a region of space with a gravitational field that is strong enough to prevent the escape of electromagnetic radiation from the interior . The boundary of this region is called the event horizon and has an effective radius called the Schwarzschild radius , which is about 26 km for Cygnus X @-@ 1 . Anything ( including matter and photons ) that passes through this boundary is unable to escape . 
 Evidence of just such an event horizon may have been detected in 1992 using ultraviolet ( UV ) observations with the High Speed Photometer on the Hubble Space Telescope . As self @-@ luminous clumps of matter spiral into a black hole , their radiation will be emitted in a series of pulses that are subject to gravitational redshift as the material approaches the horizon . That is , the wavelengths of the radiation will steadily increase , as predicted by General Relativity . Matter hitting a solid , compact object would emit a final burst of energy , whereas material passing through an event horizon would not . Two such " dying pulse trains " were observed , which is consistent with the existence of a black hole . 
 Past analysis of data from the space @-@ based Chandra X @-@ ray Observatory suggested that Cygnus X @-@ 1 was not rotating to any significant degree . However , evidence announced in 2011 suggests it is rotating extremely rapidly , approximately 790 times per second . 
 = = = = Formation = = = = 
 The largest star in the Cygnus OB3 association has a mass 40 times that of the Sun . As more massive stars evolve more rapidly , this implies that the progenitor star for Cygnus X @-@ 1 had more than 40 solar masses . Given the current estimated mass of the black hole , the progenitor star must have lost over 30 solar masses of material . Part of this mass may have been lost to HDE 226868 , while the remainder was most likely expelled by a strong stellar wind . The helium enrichment of HDE 226868 's outer atmosphere may be evidence for this mass transfer . Possibly the progenitor may have evolved into a Wolf @-@ Rayet star , which ejects a substantial proportion of its atmosphere using just such a powerful stellar wind . 
 If the progenitor star had exploded as a supernova , then observations of similar objects show that the remnant would most likely have been ejected from the system at a relatively high velocity . As the object remained in orbit , this indicates that the progenitor may have collapsed directly into a black hole without exploding ( or at most produced only a relatively modest explosion ) . 
 = = = = Accretion disk = = = = 
 The compact object is thought to be orbited by a thin , flat disk of accreting matter known as an accretion disk . This disk is intensely heated by friction between ionized gas in faster @-@ moving inner orbits and that in slower outer ones . It is divided into a hot inner region with a relatively high level of ionization — forming a plasma — and a cooler , less ionized outer region that extends to an estimated 500 times the Schwarzschild radius , or about 15 @,@ 000 km . 
 Though highly and erratically variable , Cygnus X @-@ 1 is typically the brightest persistent source of hard X @-@ rays — those with energies from about 30 up to several hundred keV — in the sky . The X @-@ rays are produced as lower energy photons in the thin inner accretion disk , then given more energy through Compton scattering with very high temperature electrons in a geometrically thicker , but nearly transparent corona enveloping it , as well as by some further reflection from the surface of the thin disk . An alternative possibility is that the X @-@ rays may be Compton scattered by the base of a jet instead of a disk corona . 
 The X @-@ ray emission from Cygnus X @-@ 1 can vary in a somewhat repetitive pattern called quasi @-@ periodic oscillations ( QPO ) . The mass of the compact object appears to determine the distance at which the surrounding plasma begins to emit these <unk> , with the emission radius decreasing as the mass decreases . This technique has been used to estimate the mass of Cygnus X @-@ 1 , providing a cross @-@ check with other mass derivations . 
 <unk> with a stable period , similar to those resulting from the spin of a neutron star , have never been seen from Cygnus X @-@ 1 . The pulsations from neutron stars are caused by the neutron star 's magnetic field , however , the no hair theorem guarantees that black holes do not have magnetic poles . For example , the X @-@ ray binary V <unk> + 53 was thought to be a possible black hole until pulsations were found . Cygnus X @-@ 1 has also never displayed X @-@ ray bursts similar to those seen from neutron stars . Cygnus X @-@ 1 unpredictably changes between two X @-@ ray states , although the X @-@ rays may vary continuously between those states as well . In the most common state , the X @-@ rays are " hard " , which means that more of the X @-@ rays have high energy . In the less common state , the X @-@ rays are " soft " , with more of the X @-@ rays having lower energy . The soft state also shows greater variability . The hard state is believed to originate in a corona surrounding the inner part of the more opaque accretion disk . The soft state occurs when the disk draws closer to the compact object ( possibly as close as 150 km ) , accompanied by cooling or ejection of the corona . When a new corona is generated , Cygnus X @-@ 1 transitions back to the hard state . 
 The spectral transition of Cyg X @-@ 1 can be explained very well using two component <unk> flow solution of Chakrabarti and <unk> http : / / <unk> @-@ <unk> / abs / <unk> ... 455 .. <unk> . Hard state is generated by inverse <unk> of seed photons from the Keplerian disk and synchrotron photons produced in <unk> by the hot electrons of <unk> . Detailed fits are in Chakrabarti and Mandal . 
 The X @-@ ray flux from Cygnus X @-@ 1 varies periodically every 5 @.@ 6 d , especially during superior conjunction when the orbiting objects are most closely aligned with the Earth and the compact source is the more distant . This indicates that the emissions are being partially blocked by circumstellar matter , which may be the stellar wind from the star HDE 226868 . There is a roughly 300 d periodicity in the emission that could be caused by the precession of the accretion disk . 
 = = = = Jets = = = = 
 As accreted matter falls toward the compact object , it loses gravitational potential energy . Part of this released energy is dissipated by jets of particles , aligned perpendicular to the accretion disk , that flow outward with relativistic velocities . ( That is , the particles are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light . ) This pair of jets provide a means for an accretion disk to shed excess energy and angular momentum . They may be created by magnetic fields within the gas that surrounds the compact object . 
 The Cygnus X @-@ 1 jets are inefficient radiators and so release only a small proportion of their energy in the electromagnetic spectrum . That is , they appear " dark " . The estimated angle of the jets to the line of sight is 30 ° and they may be precessing . One of the jets is colliding with a relatively dense part of the interstellar medium ( ISM ) , forming an energized ring that can be detected by its radio emission . This collision appears to be forming a nebula that has been observed in the optical wavelengths . To produce this nebula , the jet must have an estimated average power of 4 – 14 × 1036 erg / s , or ( 9 ± 5 ) × 1029 W. This is more than 1 @,@ 000 times the power emitted by the Sun . There is no corresponding ring in the opposite direction because that jet is facing a lower density region of the ISM . 
 In 2006 , Cygnus X @-@ 1 became the first stellar mass black hole found to display evidence of gamma ray emission in the very high energy band , above 100 GeV . The signal was observed at the same time as a flare of hard X @-@ rays , suggesting a link between the events . The X @-@ ray flare may have been produced at the base of the jet while the gamma rays could have been generated where the jet interacts with the stellar wind of HDE 226868 . 
 = = = HDE 226868 = = = 
 HDE 226868 is a supergiant star with a spectral class of <unk> Iab , which is on the borderline between class O and class B stars . It has an estimated surface temperature of <unk> K and mass approximately 20 – 40 times the mass of the Sun . Based on a stellar evolutionary model , at the estimated distance of 2 @,@ 000 parsecs this star may have a radius equal to about 15 – 17 times the solar radius and is approximately 300 @,@ 000 – 400 @,@ 000 times the luminosity of the Sun . For comparison , the compact object is estimated to be orbiting HDE 226868 at a distance of about 40 solar radii , or twice the radius of this star . 
 The surface of HDE 226868 is being tidally distorted by the gravity of the massive companion , forming a tear @-@ drop shape that is further distorted by rotation . This causes the optical brightness of the star to vary by 0 @.@ 06 magnitudes during each 5 @.@ 6 @-@ day binary orbit , with the minimum magnitude occurring when the system is aligned with the line of sight . The " ellipsoidal " pattern of light variation results from the limb darkening and gravity darkening of the star 's surface . 
 When the spectrum of HDE 226868 is compared to the similar star Epsilon Orionis , the former shows an overabundance of helium and an <unk> of carbon in its atmosphere . The ultraviolet and Hydrogen alpha spectral lines of HDE 226868 show profiles similar to the star P Cygni , which indicates that the star is surrounded by a gaseous envelope that is being accelerated away from the star at speeds of about 1500 km / s . 
 Like other stars of its spectral type , HDE 226868 is thought to be shedding mass in a stellar wind at an estimated rate of 2 @.@ 5 × 10 − 6 solar masses per year . This is the equivalent of losing a mass equal to the Sun 's every 400 @,@ 000 years . The gravitational influence of the compact object appears to be reshaping this stellar wind , producing a focused wind geometry rather than a spherically symmetrical wind . X @-@ rays from the region surrounding the compact object heat and ionize this stellar wind . As the object moves through different regions of the stellar wind during its 5 @.@ 6 @-@ day orbit , the UV lines , the radio emission , and the X @-@ rays themselves all vary . 
 The Roche lobe of HDE 226868 defines the region of space around the star where orbiting material remains gravitationally bound . Material that passes beyond this lobe may fall toward the orbiting companion . This Roche lobe is believed to be close to the surface of HDE 226868 but not overflowing , so the material at the stellar surface is not being stripped away by its companion . However , a significant proportion of the stellar wind emitted by the star is being drawn onto the compact object 's accretion disk after passing beyond this lobe . 
 The gas and dust between the Sun and HDE 226868 results in a reduction in the apparent magnitude of the star as well as a reddening of the hue — red light can more effectively penetrate the dust in the interstellar medium . The estimated value of the interstellar extinction ( AV ) is 3 @.@ 3 magnitudes . Without the intervening matter , HDE 226868 would be a fifth magnitude star and thus visible to the unaided eye .

 Cygnus X @-@ 1 was the subject of a bet between physicists Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne , in which Hawking bet against the existence of black holes in the region . Hawking later described this as an " insurance policy " of sorts . To quote from his book , A Brief History of Time , 
 According to the updated 10th anniversary edition of A Brief History of Time , Hawking has conceded the bet due to subsequent observational data in favor of black holes . In his own book , Black Holes and Time <unk> , Thorne reports that Hawking conceded the bet by breaking into Thorne 's office while he was in Russia , finding the framed bet , and signing it .

 = Hundreds ( video game ) = 
 Hundreds is a mobile puzzle video game where players touch circles to make them grow without overlapping . In the game 's 100 levels , the player interacts with different types of circles to bring a counter to the number 100 . The game was developed and published by Semi Secret Software in collaboration with Greg Wohlwend and was released for iOS on January 7 , 2013 , and on Android later that year . 
 It was originally built for the Adobe Flash platform in 2010 as indie game artist Wohlwend 's first self @-@ developed game . The game idea came from staring at the ceiling , and Wohlwend applied a grayscale color palette from his first year in art school . When Flash game sites did not purchase the title , he open sourced the code . Eric Johnson of Semi Secret ported the game to iPad , which began a collaboration between Wohlwend and the company 's Adam Saltsman , who became the primary puzzle designer . 
 The game received " generally favorable " reviews , according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic . It was an honorable mention in Best Mobile Game and Nuovo Award categories of the 2012 Independent Games Festival , their honorable mention in Excellence in Visual Art the next year , and an official selection at IndieCade 2012 . Reviewers praised its minimalist design aesthetic and puzzle variety , and criticized its obtuse cryptography subgame . Ian Bogost wrote that the game functioned like a design object , a feat unique for the video game medium . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Players touch circles onscreen to make them grow in size . Numbers within the circles count upwards with the duration of the touch . If a growing circle overlaps another , the player must restart the puzzle . Levels are completed when the numbers within the circles total 100 . There are 100 levels that progress in complexity from a simple circle with no nearby obstructions to the advanced mechanics , such as linked circles that need to be touched at once , buzzsaws that reset the numbers within the circles , and snowflakes that freeze other circles . 
 The game has no pause feature or motion controls , and there is no formal tutorial . Hidden between the puzzles are a few ciphers — incomprehensible text to be decoded through substitution cipher and other methods . The endless mode unlocks when the 100 puzzles are complete , and features a series of randomly generated levels .

 Hundreds is a puzzle game developed and published by Semi Secret Software : Adam Saltsman of Canabalt , Greg Wohlwend of Puzzlejuice , composer Scott Morgan ( also known as <unk> ) , and developer Eric Johnson . 
 Wohlwend originally built Hundreds as a Flash game . As an artist , he wanted to experiment with game programming following his release of Solipskier with programmer Mike Boxleiter . He developed the game from an idea he had while staring at a ceiling , where he imagined a circle growing without overlapping another when growing . He found this to be a good core game concept and based the game around " patience and persistence " . The game 's style inadvertently borrowed from his first year in art school , where Wohlwend composed in black , white , and red so as to focus on composition rather than color . The Flash version was released in 2010 and is available online at Newgrounds . The Flash version was much simpler in design , and added circles onscreen as the game progressed . This gameplay evolved into what became the iOS release . 
 Though Wohlwend describes his interest in " simple and elegant " game design as permeating his works , Hundreds 's minimalism was also functional due to his inexperience with programming . The code was " brute forced " and written in a single file . It was the first game he programmed , though he had some assistance with the in @-@ game physics . Wohlwend wanted the game to be purchased by a Flash game site like Kongregate or Newgrounds . When the sites were not interested , he chose to open source his code , partly with the intent to spur " non @-@ coders " to try coding , as he had . At the time , Semi Secret Software was in a lull between projects . 
 Programmer Eric Johnson of Semi Secret found the open source version and ported the game to iPad in a weekend before notifying Wohlwend . At the time , Wohlwend did not have an iOS device to test the port , and had to purchase an iPad . Johnson 's iPad version spurred Wohlwend to consider how Hundreds would work with multitouch and cooperative play , and Semi Secret 's Adam Saltsman to consider a Hundreds collaboration , especially as the company lacked the funds to work on a new game from scratch . They began to work towards an iOS release . Saltsman expected Wohlwend to work with Johnson to finish the game in a few months by adding new " circle types " and designing 100 discrete puzzles , but extended that estimate and joined the project himself in that time . Wohlwend and Saltsman extended the game 's mechanics with new circles and puzzles , but their results were clunky . Saltsman recalled wanting to add atop the game 's " basic building blocks " , which took them off @-@ track after a few months and took a few additional months to recover . Wohlwend wanted to make the game easier than the Flash version and so proposed ten new circles that were not adopted . However , he was happy with the final result and credited the game 's " emergent interaction " qualities to Saltsman . They built on each other 's level designs , though Wohlwend said that Saltsman made " basically all the levels " . The new team enjoyed working with each other . 
 The core differences between the Flash and iOS versions are a new endless mode and a narrative element based on ciphers and codes . The latter feature spiraled from email conversations between Wohlwend and Saltsman about a " really obtuse and weird " subgame that functioned as a story . Wohlwend credited Saltsman with the idea of a Brave New World @-@ style fiction within the game that used ciphers , though the idea was also influenced by a similar plot element in Dash Shaw 's Bottomless Belly Button . The endless mode was added about six months into development . They hoped the game 's presentation conveyed " honest and confident rather than overly mysterious and weird " . The team was also inspired by Superbrothers : Sword & Sworcery EP 's boldness . 
 Hundreds was first announced at the 2012 Game Developers Conference and " reannounced " later that year following changes in its presentation . It was released on January 7 , 2013 for iPhone and iPad , and on June 28 for Android . It was later added to the November 2013 Humble Mobile Bundle 3 . The composer released a compilation of remixes of the Hundreds track as 100 Minutes on Bandcamp in June 2013 .

Hundreds was also an official selection at IndieCade 2012 . 
 Reviewers noted the game 's unadorned nature . Edge called it " handsomely austere " , " modish " , and " elegant " . Dan Ryckert of Game Informer complimented its simplicity , and The Guardian 's Stuart Dredge found the game 's minimalism " stylish " and its gameplay " genuinely hypnotic " . Eurogamer 's Dan Whitehead said the game was " basically interactive porn for graphic designers " . Nissa Campbell from TouchArcade wrote that its red , gray , and black graphics were " striking " albeit not flashy , and that the game was interesting " visually , aurally , and mechanically " . In a piece for The Atlantic , Ian Bogost wrote that its game , visual , and interaction design " embodied an elegant minimalism " akin to the <unk> aesthetic promoted by Apple . He added that Hundreds had cultural cachet " unprecedented " in the medium of video games and similar to that of other design objects — that the game was closer to Prada or a lobby bar than to Angry Birds . Bogost felt that it required an amount of attention unlike other " time @-@ waster " mobile games , and referred to the precarious strategies required to complete some levels as a " multi @-@ touch ballet " . 
 Edge thought the game to be " an astoundingly harmonious mix of art and design " and said its " simple premise " is " perfectly suited for a multitouch screen " . The magazine noted that the game occasionally becomes one of patience and not skill due to the degree of entropy in each level . Dan Ryckert of Game Informer noted Hundreds as one of the better examples of games that successfully " embraced the simplicity of touch control " , such that translation to traditional controller would be " virtually impossible " . He appreciated the way the game slowly introduced the new circle types , though he did not like how his hand occasionally obscured the screen . ( For this reason , reviewers preferred the iPad version for its larger screen . ) Multiple reviewers liked how the game continually renewed itself with the slow introduction of new game elements , though Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer described the core gameplay as " one @-@ note " and criticized its lack of addictive loops that keep players interested . Mike Rose of Gamasutra compared the game as the inverse of <unk> . 
 Multiple reviewers noted Hundreds 's variety of puzzles and endgame difficulty . Edge commented that the " arcane codes " and puzzles with prescribed solutions made the game 's pacing " unusual " when compared to the other puzzles designed to be completed leisurely . Slater of Pocket Gamer too felt the pacing was " swift but uninspiring " , and Eurogamer 's Whitehead called its rhythm " weird " as he waited for the right opportunity some puzzles and could finish others with a single trick . Game Informer 's Ryckert also found the final puzzles too aggravating , especially the ones with invisible elements . Campbell of TouchArcade appreciated the variety of puzzles from " twitch " to " slow and thoughtful " to , her favorite , the " cerebral " puzzles that required specific tricks as well as the ability to skip puzzles . She also found the last level nigh impossible . Multiple reviewers felt that the cipher puzzles were out of place , and TouchArcade said it was easy to ignore them as what felt like an " utterly distinct " game . The Atlantic 's Bogost thought that the hidden ciphers were the " surest clue " of its status as " a design object and not a consumable media experience " . Slater of Pocket Gamer wrote that the ciphers felt forced and unexciting , and was disappointed overall in consideration of " the incredible talent involved " . Whitehead of Eurogamer called the puzzles " deftly constructed " and said the game " delights more than it frustrates " . Wired 's Ryan Rigney wrote that Hundreds distinguished itself among iOS puzzle games in its style and design .

 The tammar wallaby ( Macropus eugenii ) , also known as the dama wallaby or <unk> wallaby , is a small macropod native to South and Western Australia . Though its geographical range has been severely reduced since European colonisation , the tammar remains common within its reduced range and is listed as " Least Concern " by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . It has been introduced to New Zealand and reintroduced to some areas of Australia where it had been previously eradicated . Skull differences distinguish tammars from Western Australia , Kangaroo Island and mainland South Australia , making them distinct population groups or possibly different subspecies . 
 About the size of a rabbit , the tammar is among the smallest of the wallabies in the genus Macropus . Its coat colour is largely grey . The tammar has several notable adaptations , including the ability to retain energy while hopping , colour vision and the ability to drink seawater . A nocturnal species , it spends night time in grassland habitat and day time in shrubland . It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal , promiscuous mating pattern . A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus . The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials , and on mammals in general . It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced . 
 = = Taxonomy and classification = = 
 The tammar wallaby was seen in the Houtman Abrolhos off Western Australia by survivors of the 1628 Batavia shipwreck , and recorded by François <unk> in his 1629 <unk> <unk> . It was first described in 1817 by the French naturalist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest , who gave it the name eugenii based on where it was found ; an island he knew as Ile Eugene in the Nuyts Archipelago off South Australia which is now known as St Peter Island . The island 's French name was given in honour of Eugene Hamelin , commander of the ship Naturaliste ; whose name is now the specific name of the tammar . The common name of the animal is derived from the thickets of the shrub locally known as <unk> ( Allocasuarina campestris ) that sheltered it in Western Australia . The tammar is classified together with the kangaroos , <unk> and several species of wallaby in the genus Macropus , and in the subgenus <unk> with the other wallabies , all of which have a facial stripe . 
 Fossil evidence of the tammar wallaby exists from the late Pleistocene era — remains were found in the Naracoorte Caves . The mainland and island dwelling tammars split from each other 7 @,@ 000 – 15 @,@ 000 years ago , while the South Australian and Western Australian animals diverged around 50 @,@ 000 years ago . The tammar wallabies on Flinders Island had greyer coats and thinner heads than the Kangaroo Island tammars , which are larger than the East and West Wallabi Islands animals . The island tammars were once thought to be a separate species from the mainland population . A 1991 examination of tammar skulls from different parts of the species ' range found that populations can be divided into three distinct groups ; one group made of populations from mainland Western Australia , East and West Wallabi Islands , Garden Island and Middle Island ; a second group comprising populations from Flinders Island , 19th century mainland Southern Australia and New Zealand ; and a third group consisting solely of the Kangaroo Island population . The Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation listed these populations as subspecies ; M. e. derbianus , M. e. eugenii and M. e. <unk> respectively . 
 = = Description and physiology = = 
 One of the smallest wallaby species in the genus Macropus , the tammar wallaby features a small head and large ears with a long tail , thick at the base . It has dark grey @-@ brown upperparts with paler grey highlights , rufous on the sides of the body and limbs , particularly in males , and pale grey @-@ buff underparts . The tammar wallaby exhibits significant sexual dimorphism , with the maximum recorded weight in males being 9 @.@ 1 kg ( 20 lb ) and maximum recorded weight in females is 6 @.@ 9 kg ( 15 lb ) . The body length is 59 to 68 cm ( 23 – 27 in ) in males and 52 to 63 cm ( 20 – 25 in ) in females . Both males and females are about 45 cm ( 18 in ) in height . The tails of males range from 34 to 45 cm ( 13 – 18 in ) and those of females from 33 to 44 cm ( 13 – 17 in ) . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 As with most macropods , the tammar wallaby moves around by hopping . This species has a hopping frequency of 3 @.@ 5 strides per second , with a stride length of 0 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 4 m ( 2 @.@ 6 – 7 @.@ 9 ft ) . When hopping , proximal muscles at the knee and hip joints generate most of the power for each leap , which are delivered by multi @-@ joint muscles at the ankle . As it lands , the energy of the jump is converted into strain energy made when its leg tendons are stretched . As it leaps back off the ground , the tammar can recover much of this energy for reuse though elastic recoil . 
 The amount of energy stored in the tendons increases with the animal 's speed and the weight of the load it is carrying . This is particularly helpful for mothers carrying young , and explains why tammars can increase their hopping speed without using more energy . The tammar shares this characteristic with other plains @-@ dwelling macropods like the red kangaroo . By comparison , rock wallabies , such as the yellow @-@ footed rock @-@ wallaby , have traded efficient energy saving for greater tendon thickness ; an adaption for steep rocky terrain as it allows them to leap higher and lowers the risk of their tendons rupturing . 
 = = = Senses = = = 
 The tammar has 324 ° peripheral vision and 50 ° binocular vision . It can distinguish black / white gratings of different widths and in different light conditions better than most other small mammals , such as rabbits . It is nevertheless not as good as a cat or a human . Tammars appear to have some colour vision : its eyes have only blue sensitive and green sensitive photoreceptor cones , allowing it to see colour in the blue @-@ green band of the colour spectrum , but not the longer wavelengths of the red @-@ yellow band . Nevertheless , in the band where it can see colour , it can differentiate between two monochromatic colours with wavelengths as close as 20 nm ( 2 @.@ 0 × 10 − 8 m ) apart . The pinna ( ear ) of the tammar is mobile , allowing it to track sounds from different parts of its surroundings without moving its head . A tammar can point its pinna at a sound source and increase its eardrum 's sound pressure by 25 – 30 dB at 5 kHz . When the pinna moves away from the sound source , the animal 's hearing level quickly drops . When born , a tammar 's sense of smell is already developed ; this allows the newborn to find its mother 's pouch by the scent . 
 = = = Thermoregulation and water turnover = = = 
 Tammars lick their forearms and pant to keep cool in hot weather . They breathe more heavily and lose more water when the temperature is over 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) . Tammars can 't survive in temperatures above 40 ° C ( 104 ° F ) and must find cooler surroundings . To prevent dehydration , tammars urinate less and reabsorb water from the distal colon , which gives them relatively dry feces . Being able to concentrate more urine in their kidneys allows them to survive on seawater . 
 = = = Sudden deaths = = = 
 In late 1998 , 120 – 130 tammar wallabies died suddenly in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland , perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms , with most exhibiting no symptoms at all . Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle , and abdominal and thoracic organs . The syndrome is known as tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an <unk> of the family <unk> . It does not occur south of Sydney . Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months . No treatment has been attempted due to the rapid progression of the disease . 
 = = Ecology and life history = = 
 Mostly nocturnal , tammar wallabies spend much of their time foraging . In winter their home ranges are about 16 ha ( 40 acres ) , but in the dry summers they range further afield to search for quality food , needing about 42 ha ( 100 acres ) of space . <unk> home ranges overlap with those of conspecifics . 
 During the day , tammars stay close to scrub for shade and move out to more open grassland by nightfall . Like all macropods , the tammar is herbivorous . They are known to both graze and browse , but the latter is less effective , as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them . When eating large leaves , tammars handle them with their forelimbs . This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods , which likely aids digestion . Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds . Other species consumed include heart @-@ leaved poison ( Gastrolobium <unk> ) , small @-@ flowered wallaby grass ( <unk> <unk> ) , and marri ( Corymbia calophylla ) . Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water , subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants . 
 The tammar rests in two positions : a " sitting tail forward " position , in which the hind legs are outstretched with tail brought forward in between , the body prone and the head above ground ; and a " lying " position , in which the animal lies on its side with the head touching the ground . The former position is typically used during the day for long periods , and the latter position is used at night for brief periods . Tammars are known to live in stable groups , which lessens the chance of an individual being taken by a predator . As the group increases in size , tammars spend more time foraging , grooming and interacting and less time being vigilant and moving around . Predators of the tammar include dingos , feral cats , red foxes and wedge @-@ tailed eagles . They may also have been preyed upon by the extinct thylacine . Tammars appear to respond more to the sight than the sound of predators . They can also use their acute sense of smell to detect a predator . When a predator is detected , a tammar will alert others by thumping its foot . When lost , young tammars are known to emit a coarse screeching call and adult females may respond with a similar call . 
 = = = Breeding and development = = = 
 The tammar wallaby has a promiscuous mating system . It is a seasonal breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February . During the breeding season , the male 's prostate and <unk> gland enlarge . However , there does not appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes . Around two weeks before the first births , the males will begin sniffing the <unk> @-@ genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status . After giving birth , females enter estrus and allow males to mate with them . However , a male that attempts to mate with an estrous female may face aggression from other males . A male can achieve reproductive success by mate @-@ guarding . During the estrous period , males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females . Several males may pursue a single female . 
 The female tammar can conceive shortly after giving birth . Tammars undergo embryonic diapause and the blastocyst remains dormant for nearly a year . For the first half of the year , the presence of the joey in the pouch prevents the blastocyst from developing and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this first half will stimulate the blastocyst 's development . However , after this the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left . It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later . After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by its mother from the birth canal to the pouch . 
 When it reaches the pouch , the underdeveloped joey suckles the teat of one of the four mammary glands while the others recede . The joey remains attached to the teat for 100 – 125 days , after which it ceases its attachment but remains in the pouch and continues to suckle , but more intermittently . The joey begins to leave the pouch and eat grass at around 200 days when it is more developed . It still suckles , more forcefully but less regularly . By 250 days , the joey no longer needs the pouch , and it is fully weaned at around 300 – 350 days . The tammar wallaby has been observed to engage in alloparental care , in which an adult may adopt another 's young . Male tammars may live for around 11 years , while females live for 14 years . 
 = = Population dynamics and conservation = = 
 The tammar wallaby is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN , because of its abundance and presumably stable population . However , the fragmentation of its range has led to high amounts of inbreeding and morphological abnormalities in some populations . 
 Since European occupation , tammar wallaby populations on both mainland Australia and some of the islands have been greatly reduced or even eradicated . In the early 20th century , the mainland population of tammars in Western Australia was described as numerous in much of the southwest , but declining in the cultivated areas , particularly to the north . <unk> made for wheat and sheep caused the population to decline further . From the 19th century , tammars in the Eyre Peninsula and around Adelaide were decimated by mobs of hunters organised to protect crops and pastures . As a result , they were extinct in the areas around Adelaide by the 1920s , and in the Eyre Peninsula around the 1970s . Tammars from Flinders Island and St Peter Island were eradicated in a similar manner . 
 Tammars from these areas were introduced to <unk> Island in New Zealand by colonial administrator Sir George Grey in 1870 . Since then , they have flourished to the point where their foraging has damaged indigenous plants . Pest control operators have used sodium fluoroacetate , a naturally occurring rodenticide , to control their populations , a practice which has been controversial because of its possible effect on organisms not targeted , including humans . Cyanide pellets have been used as an alternative . In 1985 , tammars were introduced to the North Island of the Houtman Abrolhos and have made similar impacts on native vegetation . Their numbers grew to 450 individuals , but by 2008 culling efforts appeared to have reduced their numbers to 25 individuals . In 2003 , the Monarto Zoo temporarily housed 85 tammars from New Zealand awaiting reintroduction to the Innes National Park on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia . Four releases have been made , and a stable wild population of 100 – 120 animals now exists . Tammars have also been successfully translocated to other areas , such as <unk> National Park and Avon Valley National Park in Western Australia . 
 = = = Resistance to sodium fluoroacetate = = = 
 Different tammar populations have varying levels of resistance to sodium fluoroacetate . Mainland Western tammars appear to be the most resistant , while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable . Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable , as the poison has been successfully used to control their populations . Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island , which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate , are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island . This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia , where the poison is found in plants .

 The tammar wallaby is a model organism for studying marsupial biology , as well as mammal biology in general . It has been used in the fields of reproductive biology , immunology , metabolism , neurobiology and many others . Its " seasonal and lactational control of its reproduction " make its reproduction particularly suited for study . Tammars are inexpensive to keep in captivity and are easy to handle . They also breed well , especially if there is at least one male for five females . Tammars used for scientific study are generally housed in outdoor pens with access to water and shelter , which is closer to their natural habitat than a laboratory . 
 The genomes of marsupials are of great interest to scientists studying comparative genomics , and the study of tammars has provided much information about the genetics of marsupials and mammals in general . Marsupials are at a convenient degree of evolutionary divergence from humans ; mice are too close and have not developed many different functions , while birds are genetically too remote . Key immune genes from the tammar wallaby were isolated and studied in 2009 , and the full genome was sequenced in 2011 . Sequencing of the tammar genome found " innovation in reproductive and lactational genes , rapid evolution of germ cell genes , and incomplete , locus @-@ specific X inactivation " . The researchers also found new <unk> genes that control gene expression , as well as novel microRNAs . The tammar genome appears to have more rearrangements than those of both the human and the gray short @-@ tailed opossum , another sequenced marsupial . 
 = = = Potential pharmaceutical use = = = 
 A compound in the milk of the tammar wallaby called <unk> has the potential to be a new and powerful antibiotic . <unk> is a protein , and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin . It has killed over 99 % of the pathogenic bacteria , ( both Gram @-@ positive and Gram @-@ negative ) , that it was incubated with , including Salmonella , Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus . It also killed one species of fungus . Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several <unk> peptides , which could also be used as antibiotics . 
 = = = Gut microbiota related with greenhouse effect = = = 
 The foregut of the tammar wallaby contains species of bacteria belonging to the phyla Firmicutes , <unk> and <unk> . Within the phylum <unk> , species of the family <unk> are the most abundant and a new species named WG – 1 was discovered . WG – 1 is a <unk> bacterium . This has important environmental implications as the bacteria produces less methane than others and does not require CO2 to survive .

 In Norse mythology , Gná is a goddess who runs errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and rides the flying , sea @-@ treading horse Hófvarpnir ( Old Norse " he who throws his hoofs about " , " hoof @-@ thrower " or " hoof kicker " ) . Gná and Hófvarpnir are attested in the Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson . Scholarly theories have been proposed about Gná as a " goddess of fullness " and as potentially cognate to Fama from Roman mythology . Hófvarpnir and the eight @-@ legged steed Sleipnir have been cited examples of transcendent horses in Norse mythology . 
 = = Attestations = = 
 In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning , the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur . High lists Gná thirteenth , and says that Frigg sends her off to different worlds to run errands . High adds that Gná rides the horse Hófvarpnir , and that this horse has the ability to ride through the air and atop the sea . High continues that " once some Vanir saw her path as she rode through the air " and that an unnamed one of these Vanir says , in verse : 
 " What flies there ? 
 What fares there ? 
 or moves through the air ? " 
 Gná responds in verse , in doing so providing the parentage of Hófvarpnir ; the horses <unk> and <unk> : 
 " I fly not 
 though I fare 
 and move through the air 
 on <unk> 
 the one whom <unk> got 
 with <unk> . " 
 The source for these stanzas is not provided and they are otherwise unattested . High ends his description of Gná by saying that " from <unk> 's name comes the custom of saying that something <unk> [ looms ] when it rises up high . " In the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál , Gná is included among a list of 27 ásynjur names .

 Rudolf Simek says that the etymology that Snorri presents in Gylfaginning for the name Gná may not be correct , yet it is unclear what the name may otherwise mean , though Gná has also been etymologically theorized as a " goddess of fullness . " John Lindow calls the verse exchange between the Vanir and Gná " strange " and points out that it 's unclear why it should specifically be the Vanir that witness Gná flying through the air . 
 Ulla <unk> cites Hófvarpnir and the eight @-@ legged horse Sleipnir as " prime examples " of horses in Norse mythology as being able to " mediate between earth and sky , between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and between the world of mortal men and the underworld . " In the 19th century , Jacob Grimm proposed a cognate in the personified rumor in Roman mythology ; Fama . However , Grimm notes that unlike Fama , Gná is not described as winged but rather that Hófvarpnir , like the winged @-@ horse Pegasus , may have been .

 " No Church in the Wild " is a song by American hip hop artists Kanye West and Jay @-@ Z from their first collaborative album Watch the Throne ( 2011 ) . It is the first track on the album and features vocals from Odd Future 's Frank Ocean and The @-@ Dream , although the latter is uncredited for his contributions to the song . The song explores themes of religion and decadence . The track received highly positive reviews from music critics , who praised Ocean 's vocal hooks , the depth of the verses , the cinematic production and the song 's power as an opening track . 
 The track was released as the seventh and final single from Watch the Throne . The song peaked at number 72 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and entered the top 40 on both the US Billboard Hot Rap Songs and Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs charts . The song received a music video directed by Romain Gavras released on May 29 , 2012 . The video does not feature any of the performers featured on the song and instead features anarchic riot footage and large street fights . The video received positive reviews from critics who praised the visuals of the video and the unique aesthetic presented in the video . 
 Jay @-@ Z and West performed the song as part of the setlist of their Watch the Throne Tour and Ocean performed his portion of the song on several different occasions during his November 2011 tour through North America and Europe . " No Church in the Wild " was featured in the theatrical trailers for the 2012 action film Safe House and the 2013 film adaptation of The Great Gatsby . The song itself has debuted at # 18 on the US Billboard YouTube 100 music video chart in July 2012 . The song received a nomination for Best Rap / Sung Collaboration and Best Short Form Music Video at the 55th Grammy Awards to be held in February 2013 . It later won in the category of Best Rap / Sung Collaboration , marking this Jay @-@ Z 's sixth win & Kanye 's fourth win in this category .

 Jay @-@ Z and Kanye West are American rappers who have collaborated on several tracks together , such as singles like " Swagga Like Us " , " Run This Town " , and " Monster " . In 2010 , they began production and recording on a collaborative record Watch the Throne . Frank Ocean is an R & B recording artist who released his debut mixtape Nostalgia , Ultra in early 2011 to critical acclaim . The release of the mixtape interested West , who was reported to be a large fan . West invited Ocean to write and sing on two songs off of the record . Frank wrote and provided vocals on tracks " No Church in the Wild " and " Made in America " and the songs were recorded in New York . The production of the track was handled by 88 @-@ Keys and Kanye West . 88 @-@ Keys reportedly " played 20 of his beats " to West and Jay , and " everybody in the room just started going crazy " . An hour later , they had singled out the beat that would become ' " No Church in the Wild . " The next day , 88 @-@ Keys met Frank Ocean and they recorded the chorus together and an unreleased spoken word portion . 88 @-@ Keys did not hear the final version until Jay @-@ Z showcased it at the invite @-@ only listening session at the Museum of Natural History 's planetarium in August 2011 . Producer and recording artist The @-@ Dream sings a verse on the track using <unk> . The track impacted urban radio as the seventh and final single from Watch the Throne on March 20 , 2012 .

 " No Church in the Wild " features a cinematic production style and serves as an " ominous opener . " According to Billboard , Odd Future singer Frank Ocean and The @-@ Dream lend their voices to the album 's " grim opener , " which sets the mood with a " gnarled guitar sample " . It features a bass @-@ heavy beat with guitar riffs , synthesizers , and drums . The song begins with Frank Ocean 's chorus followed by a Jay @-@ Z verse about various topics including philosophy , braggadocio and religion . On Ocean 's chorus , Los Angeles Times writer Randall Roberts stated " with it the listener enters a bejeweled realm , one filled with musings on the spoils of riches and the chaos that accompanies it . " The chorus " underpins Jay @-@ Z 's contemplation of the relevance of the clergy and ancient philosophers to someone who makes his living on the streets , while R & B star Frank Ocean questions , " What is a God to a non @-@ believer ? " " The chorus then repeats and The @-@ Dream performs a bridge , preceding West 's verse where he boasts " You will not control the threesome . " West 's verse included references to Socrates , the perils of monogamy , " implied regicide " and both rappers " take turns describing a night of decadence that leaves blood on the coliseum walls . ” The song contains samples from " K Scope " as performed by Phil Manzanera , " Sunshine Help Me " as performed by Spooky Tooth and " Don 't Tell a Lie About Me and I Won 't Tell the Truth About You " as performed by James Brown . According to the Alexis Petridis of The Guardian , the track utilizes " unlikely samples " with " Ocean 's haunting vocal against Roxy Music 's Phil Manzanera playing a <unk> prog riff . "

 " No Church in the Wild " received mostly positive reviews from music critics and was often described as a highlight from Watch the Throne . Andy Gill of The Independent stated " the best track is surely the opener ' No Church in the Wild ' , whose deep , detuned twang groove , over a marching organ motif , is the most striking music on the album , promising rather more than the rest of the record is able to deliver . Both this and the other stand @-@ out track , " Made In America " , feature assured vocal refrains from Frank Ocean , while the two rappers muse over familiar themes of loyalty , sexuality and maternal solidarity . " Rolling Stone claims that it is one of the most musically impressive songs on Watch the Throne and describes the production as an " ominous , darkly funky bass groove and chilly synths tailor @-@ made for Ocean ’ s off @-@ kilter crooning . " Matt <unk> from American Songwriter praised Jay @-@ Z 's verse and the menacing vibe of the song . NOW claims that " uncomfortably visceral opener ' No Church In The Wild ' – with its filthy Phil Manzanera guitar sample and mournful Frank Ocean chorus – cuts to the heart of Watch The Throne ’ s power dynamic . " However , PopMatters criticized that the verses " feel a little out of focus compared to the hook and beat ’ s opulence . " Sputnikmusic 's Tyler Fisher commented " 88 @-@ Keys creates a positively epic opening track with ' No Church in the Wild ' , full of creeping guitar riffs and pulsating bass , building tension that simply never releases . " Rolling Stone named the track the sixth best song of the year , reporting that " with Hov and Yeezy getting deep into arcane theology , this track is just another high . "

 The track was performed by West and Jay on their Watch the Throne Tour . Ocean performed his hook of the song at some of the performances during his 2011 concert series through the US and Europe .

 A music video was filmed in late April 2012 in the Czech Republic by the Greek @-@ French director Romain Gavras , known for his work for M.I.A and Justice . There were two hundred extras , divided into police and rioters . The final video was released on May 29 , 2012 . The video is " clearly influenced by the protests and civil unrest that took place all across the country . " The video 's final shot bears similarity to an image from visual artist <unk> 's project , The Wild . Rolling Stone reported that the " clip for " No Church in the Wild " depicts a grim clash between a large number of protesters and heavily armed and violent riot police . " 
 The video features neither West , Jay @-@ Z or Ocean , but instead focuses on two groups : " protestors and the police , both at war with one another . And yes , this is war — it ’ s an unsettling and savage clip , depicting protestors being beaten and pepper @-@ sprayed as they mercilessly combat with the police , though the protestors @-@ turned @-@ rioters also inflict a large part of the violence : they destroy property , loot stores , and set fire to cars — and humans . The video refuses to take sides , as there ’ s no winner when a conflict turns to violence . " Young men are beaten , choked , sprayed with mace and dragged across the concrete as Frank Ocean soulfully croons , " Will he make it out alive ? " in time with the staged anarchy . By the end of the five @-@ minute video , " the freedom fighters seem to have notched a victory of some sort , standing in triumph in the face of their oppressors . But even if a single battle is won , there is no conclusive ending , meaning that the war still rages on . " Popping up at the end of the clip is an actual elephant , chained at the neck and trying to resist getting choked to death . Pitchfork Media gave the clip a positive review , however noted " Kanye 's " you will not control the threesome " / " never fuck nobody without telling me " verse seems pretty out of place when you 're watching a cop get set on fire .

 Perfect Dark is a first @-@ person shooter video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 video game console . It is considered the spiritual successor to Rare 's earlier first @-@ person shooter GoldenEye 007 , with which it shares many gameplay features . Perfect Dark was first released in North America on 22 May 2000 ; PAL and NTSC @-@ J releases followed soon afterwards . A separate Game Boy Color game , also titled Perfect Dark , was released in August 2000 as a supplement to the game and allows certain features within the Nintendo 64 game to alternatively be unlocked via a Transfer Pak . 
 The game features a single @-@ player mode consisting of 17 main missions in which the player assumes the role of Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark as she attempts to stop a conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne . It also features a range of multiplayer options , including a co @-@ operative mode and traditional deathmatch settings . Technically , it is one of the most advanced games developed for the Nintendo 64 , with an optional high resolution graphics mode , widescreen support , and Dolby Surround Sound . A Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is required to access the game 's campaign and most of the multiplayer features . 
 Perfect Dark was developed over the course of three years and uses an upgraded version of the GoldenEye 007 engine . The game met with critical acclaim and commercial success upon release , selling more than three million units worldwide . Critics widely praised its customisable multiplayer modes and replay value , but criticized its inconsistent frame rate . The game 's success has led to the development of the Perfect Dark series , which includes the 2005 prequel Perfect Dark Zero and other types of merchandise like novels and comic books . A remake , also titled Perfect Dark , with enhanced graphics and online multiplayer , was exclusively released as an Xbox Live Arcade game for the Xbox 360 in 2010 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Perfect Dark is a first @-@ person shooter in which players control Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark through a series of levels collected together into missions . The general gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor GoldenEye 007 , with features such as stealth sections and objectives determined by difficulty settings carried over . Players can crouch , duck , lean , and drop from most ledges , but there is no jump ability . A number of tutorials and training activities can be taken at the Carrington Institute , which acts as the game 's central hub . The Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is needed to access the game 's campaign and most of the multiplayer features , although a limited subset of the Combat Simulator options are available without the device ; around 35 % of the game is playable without an Expansion Pak , as estimated on the game 's box and Instruction Booklet . 
 The player has access to a wide range of weapons , including handguns , rifles , submachine guns , a shotgun , rocket launchers , combat knives , grenade launchers , various explosives , and several extraterrestrial weapons . Further weapons are unlocked during the training activities in the hub . Almost all of the weapons in the game have two modes of fire : a primary mode in which the weapon is used in a typical fashion , and a secondary mode which uses the guns in other ways , such as them being close @-@ quarters melee weapons . Players can carry an unlimited number of weapons , and certain guns can be used in duplicate , one in each hand . Most weapons have a finite magazine and must be reloaded after a certain number of shots . Interaction with objects in the environment is via a single " Use " command . Enemies and players can disarm each other at close range , and the player can use this feature to steal weapons or knock foes unconscious . Damage taken during combat for the player and enemy units is location @-@ based , with a shot to the torso causing more damage than a shot to a limb . 
 In each level , the player must complete certain objectives and then exit the stage . The requirements are varied , with many levels requiring the recovery and use of numerous high @-@ tech gadgets . If Joanna is killed or fails an objective , the player must start the level again . Three distinct difficulty settings are available for each level , the choice of which will affect aspects such as the number of objectives that must be completed , enemy accuracy and damage , the effectiveness of the game 's optional automatic aiming assistance , and the availability of ammunition and items such as protective shields . If all the levels are completed on the highest difficulty , an additional setting becomes available , titled " Perfect Dark " . In this mode , players can customise various aspects of enemies , such as their health , their aiming accuracy and the damage they inflict . In addition to the main campaign , there are four bonus missions , with three enabling the player to control other characters with unique special abilities . Players can also unlock cheats by completing the levels within certain time limits . Some cheats can alternatively be unlocked by using the Perfect Dark Game Boy Color game and Transfer Pak . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Unlike GoldenEye 007 , Perfect Dark features three multiplayer systems . The first is a co @-@ operative mode in which two players , or one player and up to three computer @-@ controlled players , can tackle the missions together . If two humans play , the game uses a split screen display , with the option to split horizontally or vertically . Only one human player is required to survive the mission , but all the objectives must be completed . Additionally , the game features a " Counter Operative " mode in which one player plays the missions as Joanna while another takes over the role of an enemy and attempts to stop her . If this human @-@ controlled guard is killed , the game continues with the Counter Operative player taking control of a different enemy in the level . The game does not tell the player controlling Joanna which enemy the Counter Operative player is controlling . 
 The third multiplayer mode is the Combat Simulator , involving up to four human players and eight computer @-@ controlled players . Again , a split @-@ screen is used if more than one human is playing . If three or four humans play , the screen is divided into quarters , with one quarter left blank if necessary . Players enter the game unarmed and with a certain amount of health . Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions . Once a player is killed , they are regenerated elsewhere in the level , once again unarmed . The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played . Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode , where players score points by killing their respective enemies , to objective @-@ based games , such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill . Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase , where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible , and Hacker Central , a gametype where players score points by hacking a computer system using a data uplink . Aspects of each game can be customised , including the chosen map , the weapons available , and the winning conditions . Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually . In a team game , the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team . Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in GoldenEye 007 's multiplayer mode , such as free weapons selection and placement of shields . 
 Computer @-@ controlled players , called " Simulants " , can be included in multiplayer matches . The appearance , team affiliation , skill level and playing characteristics of each Simulant can be individually customised ; each Simulant can be assigned pre @-@ set behaviours , such as a tendency to pursue the highest @-@ scoring player , or a restriction to only attack using fists and disarming moves instead of gunfire . On higher difficulty settings , Simulants perform actions at a superhuman level . In team games , players can issue allied Simulants with orders to perform certain tasks . The Combat Simulator also includes 30 " Challenges " , pre @-@ set games against Simulants which may be tackled by one or more players . The Challenges cover a variety of game types , weapon arrangements and level setups . By completing Challenges , additional features such as new weapons , player models and Simulant difficulties are unlocked in the Combat Simulator . At the end of a match , the overall results are shown , alongside information about the individual players ' performance : colour @-@ coded awards divided into multiple categories based on armour damage , accuracy and ammunition usage are given to players based on their overall performance . Players are also ranked according to their performance : the better the performance , the higher the grade , with the highest receiving a special username and password as a reward . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Perfect Dark is set in 2023 against the backdrop of an interstellar war between two races : the Maians , who resemble the archetypal grey alien , and the Skedar , reptile @-@ like extraterrestrials who use a holographic disguise to appear as Scandinavian humans , bearing similarities to Nordic aliens . Using the disguise , they can interact with humans on Earth without looking too overtly suspicious . Meanwhile , on Earth , there is an ongoing rivalry between two factions : The Carrington Institute , a research and development center founded by Daniel Carrington that secretly operates an espionage group in league with the Maians ; and dataDyne , a defence contractor corporation headed by Cassandra De Vries that secretly maintains a deal with the Skedar : in exchange for creating an AI capable of cracking an ancient alien spacecraft buried on the ocean floor , the Skedar have agreed to supply them with enough alien technology to become the biggest corporation on Earth . 
 The player is cast as Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark , whose excellent scores in training have earned her the codename " Perfect Dark " . On her first mission , she is sent to extract a scientist named Dr. Caroll from the dataDyne skyscraper . When Joanna rescues Dr. Caroll , she learns that he is an AI who decided to defect from dataDyne after realising that the company betrayed ethical and moral standards . After the operation , Carrington is held captive at his private villa by dataDyne soldiers and forced to tell them where Dr. Caroll has been hidden . Joanna manages to rescue Carrington , who informs her that Dr. Caroll has been taken to the G5 Corporation headquarters in Chicago because he is suspected to be a front for dataDyne . In Chicago , Joanna learns that dataDyne and their conspirators plan to kidnap the President of the United States to get access to a deep sea research vessel called Pelagic II . Despite the President being in danger , Carrington alerts Joanna that a Maian craft was shot down near Area 51 and sends her to rescue any survivors from the base . While inside the base , she rescues one survivor , a Maian protector named Elvis who is key in stopping the conspiracy . 
 As the President of the United States refuses to loan dataDyne the Pelagic II , the conspirators plot to kill him and replace him with a dataDyne @-@ grown clone . To accomplish their plans , an NSA strike team led by Trent Easton invades the air base from which Air Force One will depart . When Joanna foils this strike , the NSA along with some Scandinavians take over the plane itself , which crashes after an attempt to detach a craft attached to it . Having survived the crash , Joanna eliminates the President 's clone and rescues the real President . Meanwhile , Easton is killed by one particular Scandinavian known as Mr. Blonde , who is revealed to be a Skedar in disguise . Without permission from the President , dataDyne decides to hijack the Pelagic II and reach the ancient spacecraft . However , unbeknownst to dataDyne , the Carrington Institute learns that the spacecraft contains a powerful weapon capable of destroying a planet and that the conspirators are actually Skedar aliens disguised as Scandinavian humans who intend to test the weapon on Earth before using it against the Maian homeworld . 
 Joanna and Elvis follow the conspirators to the ancient spacecraft and eventually find a reprogrammed Dr. Caroll cracking the weapon . Joanna replaces its current personality with a backup of the original , and the restored Dr. Carroll sets the weapon to self @-@ destruct . In retaliation for ruining their plans , the Skedar launch a strike on the Carrington Institute , capturing Joanna and taking her to their homeworld . While in their spaceship , she is met by De Vries , who has also been imprisoned due to her failure to comply with the deal . Feeling that she has been used , De Vries redeems herself by making a distraction and sacrificing herself , freeing Joanna and therefore giving herself a chance for revenge . Joanna is later assisted by Elvis and the pair manage to land on the Skedar planet . There , she defeats the Skedar High Priest , leaving the Skedar in disarray . The game ends with Elvis and Joanna leaving the planet just prior to an orbital bombardment from the Maian navy .

 Perfect Dark was developed by Rare as a spiritual successor to GoldenEye 007 . Shortly after the release of GoldenEye 007 , Rare was planning to work on a video game based on the GoldenEye sequel Tomorrow Never Dies , but the company was " dramatically outbid " by another studio , which would release 007 : Tomorrow Never Dies in 1999 . This result did not affect the developers , who felt they had already spent too much time immersed in the James Bond universe . The game 's science fiction setting was chosen due to the developers ' interest in the genre . Works such as Ghost in the Shell , Elektra , The X @-@ Files , Blade Runner and the writing of author Philip K. Dick were major influences on the characters , setting and plot . Perfect Dark director Martin Hollis explained that he and designer David Doak " picked a range of locations we thought would be impressive and architectural , on the model of GoldenEye but sci @-@ fi <unk> [ ... ] The settings came first ; the plot was then constructed by Dave to sew them together " . 
 The decision to make the central character a woman was part of Hollis ' belief that there " should be more games centred on women . " To this end , the team created Joanna Dark , influenced by a number of other fictional heroines : Kim Kimberly from Level 9 Computing 's text adventure Snowball , the seductive spy Agent X @-@ 27 in the 1931 film Dishonored , the eponymous femme fatale of the film Nikita , and FBI agent Dana Scully from The X @-@ Files . The name " Joanna Dark " was taken from the French pronunciation of Joan of Arc as " Jeanne d 'Arc " , while the name of the in @-@ game company " dataDyne " was inspired by <unk> from The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon . 
 The " double slash " symbol in the game 's logo was inspired by the Japanese <unk> mark , and the bad grammar of the phrase " Perfect Dark " alludes in some degree to Hollis ' affection for the way the Japanese use English words in their own games . The word " Dark " was chosen for its association with the game 's bleak focus on killing . Hollis noted the similarities to Criterion Software 's naming of Black : " Game developers just like black , nihilism , dystopian futures , the number zero , infinity , spheres , perfection — all that kind of stuff . " Originally , Nintendo considered releasing the game in Japan under the title Aka to Kuro ( <unk> , lit . " Red and Black " ) . " Perfect Dark " does not translate well into Japanese , and the title " Aka to Kuro " was considered sufficiently edgy . However , it was ultimately released as <unk> ・ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , a transliteration of the Western title . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Work on Perfect Dark began with the same team that developed GoldenEye 007 . The developers upgraded the GoldenEye 007 engine with new features and graphical enhancements such as dynamic lighting , widescreen support , and the option to play in high resolution graphics mode . According to Rare , only 30 % of the original engine remained , providing a basic framework to construct levels and animate characters . The developers also added more elaborate gore effects , which allow gunshots to disperse and stain enemies ' blood onto nearby walls and objects . The artificial intelligence was improved so that enemies could " assess threats , work as a team and communicate with each other . " Enemies were also given the ability to draw a secondary sidearm when disarmed . A " dizziness " graphical effect was also introduced ; if a player is punched or tranquilised , their nausea is represented through a motion blurred view . The game supports advanced audio features such as Dolby Surround Sound . There is full voice @-@ acting for all in @-@ game and cutscene dialogue , and guards can be heard having conversations amongst themselves during gameplay . Nintendo wanted an American actress to voice Joanna Dark , but the negotiations were not conducted effectively enough and video game music composer Eveline Fischer was chosen to voice the character . Motion capture was used to create character animations : game designer Duncan Botwood wore a pair of high heels so that he could portray Joanna Dark in these sessions . 
 Originally , Hollis hoped that the difference between light and dark would be a significant feature of the gameplay , and the title was intended to reflect this focus . A flashlight was implemented by Steve Ellis , who had been responsible for much of the multiplayer mode of GoldenEye 007 , but it was not included in the final game due to the limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware . Hollis remarked that such aims were overambitious , commenting in 2006 that " Even today , you can see game developers struggle to make light and dark foundational from a gameplay perspective . I suspect it will take a few years before significant and pervasive gameplay innovation occurs here . " Although not all these intended features were realised , the game contains more advanced lighting than its predecessor . For example , lights can be shot out to create darkened areas , gunfire and explosions illuminate rooms dynamically , and the player can use infrared and night vision goggles . 
 Hollis was involved with Perfect Dark for the first 14 months of its three @-@ year development , during which progress was troubled and long delayed . He explained , " each of us was asking for more than the other could give . This situation ended with my departure , and with very deep regret I was unable to see Perfect Dark to completion " . By the end of 1998 , half of the team members , including Doak and Ellis , also left Rare to form Free Radical Design . What followed by those remaining on the project was a comprehensive re @-@ design of the game , with the story and characters being the main items kept intact . Game designer Mark Edmonds was promoted to team leader because he was familiar with most of the game engine at the time . Rare also assigned more people to the development team , which eventually became three times bigger than GoldenEye 007 's . The new team was " uniquely shielded from the outside world " and did not have a production manager , a schedule , meetings , or any sort of deadlines . According to artist B Jones , " People would just do things they thought were cool and would work " . The game 's Counter Operative mode was inspired by " Bottles ' Revenge " , an additional gameplay mode cut from the final release of Banjo @-@ Tooie . 
 As developers kept adding more features , the game ended up using all the extra memory on the debug consoles . As a result , the game became too big to fit into the Nintendo 64 's 4MB of random @-@ access memory ( RAM ) . The developers soon realised that they were not able to optimise it and decided to make use of the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak , which increases the Nintendo 64 's RAM from 4MB to <unk> of contiguous main memory , to support most of the features in the game . After playing the release version of the game , Hollis was impressed by the comprehensive range of multiplayer options , which he described as " a vast array of features I never planned " . Doak , however , remarked that " GoldenEye pretty much exhausted the performance of the machine . It was hard to push it further . Perfect Dark had some good ideas but was dog slow . " 
 A feature called " Perfect Head " , which appeared in previews of the game but was not included in the final product , was intended to take customisation of multiplayer profiles further . This feature allowed the player to place a photograph of their choice onto their in @-@ game character 's face , via a Game Boy Camera combined with the Nintendo 64 Transfer Pak . The images taken would be uploaded to the cartridge and manipulated with a simple image editing program to adjust colour and skin tone ( as the Game Boy Camera was black and white ) and add facial features such as facial hair . This texture could then be saved to either the cartridge or a Controller Pak and then loaded onto a player 's character in multiplayer , thus creating a virtual representation of the player . Although Rare officially said that the feature was dropped due to " technical issues " , the actual reason was revealed to be " sensitive issues " surrounding the ability to attack images of real people .
