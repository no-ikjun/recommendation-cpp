 Approximately 505 @,@ 000 km3 ( 121 @,@ 000 cu mi ) of water falls as precipitation each year across the globe with 398 @,@ 000 km3 ( 95 @,@ 000 cu mi ) of it over the oceans . Given the Earth 's surface area , that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 mm ( 39 in ) . Deserts are defined as areas with an average annual precipitation of less than 250 mm ( 10 in ) per year , or as areas where more water is lost by evapotranspiration than falls as precipitation .

 The northern half of Africa is occupied by the world 's most extensive hot , dry region , the Sahara Desert . Some deserts are also occupying much of southern Africa : the Namib and the Kalahari . Across Asia , a large annual rainfall minimum , composed primarily of deserts , stretches from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia west @-@ southwest through western Pakistan ( Balochistan ) and Iran into the Arabian Desert in Saudi Arabia . Most of Australia is semi @-@ arid or desert , making it the world 's driest inhabited continent . In South America , the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent , resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina . The drier areas of the United States are regions where the Sonoran Desert overspreads the Desert Southwest , the Great Basin and central Wyoming . 
 = = = Polar desert = = = 
 Since rain only falls as liquid , in frozen temperatures , rain cannot fall . As a result , very cold climates see very little rainfall and are often known as polar deserts . A common biome in this area is the tundra which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter . Ice caps see no rain at all , making Antarctica the world 's driest continent . 
 = = = Rainforests = = = 
 Rainforests are areas of the world with very high rainfall . Both tropical and temperate rainforests exist . Tropical rainforests occupy a large band of the planet mostly along the equator . Most temperate rainforests are located on mountainous west coasts between 45 and 55 degrees latitude , but they are often found in other areas . 
 Around 40 @-@ 75 % of all biotic life is found in rainforests . Rainforests are also responsible for 28 % of the world 's oxygen turnover . 
 = = = Monsoons = = = 
 The equatorial region near the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) , or monsoon trough , is the wettest portion of the world 's continents . Annually , the rain belt within the tropics marches northward by August , then moves back southward into the Southern Hemisphere by February and March . Within Asia , rainfall is favored across its southern portion from India east and northeast across the Philippines and southern China into Japan due to the monsoon <unk> moisture primarily from the Indian Ocean into the region . The monsoon trough can reach as far north as the 40th parallel in East Asia during August before moving southward thereafter . Its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure ( a thermal low ) over the warmest part of Asia . Similar , but weaker , monsoon circulations are present over North America and Australia . During the summer , the Southwest monsoon combined with Gulf of California and Gulf of Mexico moisture moving around the subtropical ridge in the Atlantic ocean bring the promise of afternoon and evening thunderstorms to the southern tier of the United States as well as the Great Plains . The eastern half of the contiguous United States east of the 98th meridian , the mountains of the Pacific Northwest , and the Sierra Nevada range are the wetter portions of the nation , with average rainfall exceeding 760 mm ( 30 in ) per year . Tropical cyclones enhance precipitation across southern sections of the United States , as well as Puerto Rico , the United States Virgin Islands , the Northern Mariana Islands , Guam , and American Samoa . 
 = = = Impact of the Westerlies = = = 
 Westerly flow from the mild north Atlantic leads to wetness across western Europe , in particular Ireland and the United Kingdom , where the western coasts can receive between 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 39 in ) , at sea @-@ level and 2 @,@ 500 mm ( 98 in ) , on the mountains of rain per year . Bergen , Norway is one of the more famous European rain @-@ cities with its yearly precipitation of 2 @,@ 250 mm ( 89 in ) on average . During the fall , winter , and spring , Pacific storm systems bring most of Hawaii and the western United States much of their precipitation . Over the top of the ridge , the jet stream brings a summer precipitation maximum to the Great Lakes . Large thunderstorm areas known as mesoscale convective complexes move through the Plains , Midwest , and Great Lakes during the warm season , contributing up to 10 % of the annual precipitation to the region . 
 The El Niño @-@ Southern Oscillation affects the precipitation distribution , by altering rainfall patterns across the western United States , Midwest , the Southeast , and throughout the tropics . There is also evidence that global warming is leading to increased precipitation to the eastern portions of North America , while droughts are becoming more frequent in the tropics and subtropics .

 = HMS Kent ( 54 ) = 
 HMS Kent , pennant number 54 , was a County @-@ class heavy cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the late 1920s . She was the lead ship of the Kent subclass . After completion the ship was sent to the China Station where she remained until the beginning of the Second World War , aside from a major refit in 1937 – 38 . Kent hunted the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee in the East Indies in late 1939 and then was reassigned to troop convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean in early 1940 . She was transferred to the Mediterranean in mid @-@ 1940 , but was torpedoed shortly after arriving . The ship was under repair for a year and was then assigned to Home Fleet where she escorted convoys to and from North Russia for the next several years . In mid @-@ 1944 Kent escorted British aircraft carriers as their aircraft made attacks on German shipping and airfields in Norway . A few months later was flagship of a force that intercepted a German convoy in Norwegian waters and sank two freighters and five escorts . The ship was paid off in early 1945 and placed in reserve until she was used as a target . Kent was sold for scrap in 1948 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Kent displaced 9 @,@ 850 long tons ( 10 @,@ 010 t ) at standard load and 13 @,@ 520 long tons ( 13 @,@ 740 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 630 feet ( 192 @.@ 0 m ) , a beam of 68 feet 5 inches ( 20 @.@ 9 m ) and a draught of 20 feet 6 inches ( 6 @.@ 2 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving four shafts , which developed a total of 80 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 60 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 31 @.@ 5 knots ( 58 @.@ 3 km / h ; 36 @.@ 2 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by eight Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Kent carried a maximum of 3 @,@ 425 long tons ( 3 @,@ 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 13 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 24 @,@ 600 km ; 15 @,@ 300 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 784 officers and men . 
 The ship mounted eight 50 @-@ calibre 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) guns in four twin gun turrets . Her secondary armament consisted of four QF 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) Mk V anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns in single mounts . Kent mounted four single 2 @-@ pounder ( 40 mm ) light AA guns ( " pom @-@ poms " ) . The ship carried two quadruple torpedo tube above @-@ water mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . 
 Kent was only lightly protected with little more than a single inch of plating protecting vital machinery . Her magazines were the exception and were protected by 2 – 4 @.@ 375 inches ( 50 @.@ 8 – 111 @.@ 1 mm ) of armour . Space and weight was reserved for one aircraft catapult and its seaplane , but they were not fitted until after she was completed . 
 = = History = = 
 Kent was built by Chatham Dockyard and laid down on 15 November 1924 . She was launched on 16 March 1926 and commissioned 25 June 1928 . The ship was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron on the China Station and spent the bulk of the interbellum period there . In 1929 – 30 she received a High @-@ Angle Control System , used to direct her anti @-@ aircraft guns , and an aircraft catapult was also fitted . Her AA armament was reinforced by the addition of two single 4 @-@ inch guns abreast the forward funnel in 1932 – 33 . Two quadruple Vickers .50 @-@ calibre ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) Mark III machine guns were added in 1934 . 
 In 1937 , Kent returned to Chatham and underwent a major refit , which included a 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 114 mm ) Krupp cemented armour belt abreast the engine and boiler rooms as well as the dynamo room and the fire control transmitting station . This belt extended 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) down from the lower deck . Four inches of armour were also added to protect the sides of the boiler room fan compartments . The ship 's aft director was moved to a pedestal abaft the searchlight tower that replaced the original aft control station . Two octuple @-@ barrel 2 @-@ pounder mounts were added abreast the searchlight tower . The changes raised the ship 's displacement by 74 long tons ( 75 t ) and cost an estimated £ 161 @,@ 000 . Unlike her sister ships , no aircraft hangar was added because that would have pushed her over the Washington Naval Treaty limits , but her catapult was replaced with a more powerful one capable of handling the heavier Supermarine Walrus flying boat . 
 In November 1939 she joined with the French heavy cruiser Suffren and the Australian destroyers Voyager and Vampire to hunt for the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee in the East Indies and then was reassigned to escort troop convoys in the Indian Ocean in January 1940 . 
 Following the declaration of war by Italy , she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet , arriving at Alexandria in August 1940 with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron . On 17 August 1940 , Kent , the battleships Warspite , Malaya , Ramillies and twelve destroyers bombarded Italian positions near Bardia and Fort Capuzzo . Two weeks later the ship participated in Operation Hats , escorting a convoy from Alexandria to Malta . 
 On 15 September 1940 the battleship Valiant , the aircraft carrier Illustrious , Kent , the anti @-@ aircraft cruisers Calcutta and Coventry , and seven destroyers left Alexandria bound for Benghazi . During the night of 16 / 17 September 1940 , aircraft from the Illustrious mined the harbour of Benghazi . They also attacked shipping in the harbour with torpedoes and bombs , sinking two destroyers and two merchant ships . Kent and two destroyers were detached to bombard Bardia while returning to Alexandria . During the night of 17 / 18 September 1940 the ship was hit in the stern by a torpedo from Italian Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.79 bombers from the 279th Independent Torpedo Squadron ( Italian : Squadriglia <unk> <unk> ) led by Carlo Emanuele Buscaglia . She was towed back to base by the destroyers with great difficulty . 
 Kent was given temporary repairs at Alexandria from 19 September to 18 October to allow her to return to the United Kingdom . Extensive repairs at Devonport Dockyard followed from 1 January to 20 September 1941 . During this time six Oerlikon 20 mm light AA guns were added and the ship received a variety of radars . These included Type 284 radar for surface gunnery control , Type 285 anti @-@ aircraft gunnery radar , and a Type 281 air warning radar . When her repairs were completed in September 1941 , she spent several months working up . On 8 December Kent sailed from Scapa Flow carrying the British Foreign Secretary , Anthony Eden , and the Soviet Ambassador to Great Britain , Ivan Maisky . She reached Murmansk on 12 December where the diplomats disembarked to meet with Joseph Stalin . Kent sortied on 17 December , with two Soviet destroyers , in a failed attempt to intercept the German 8th Destroyer Flotilla that was engaging two British minesweepers attempting to rendezvous with Convoy PQ 6 . The ship brought Eden back home by 29 December . 
 The cruiser was assigned to the Home Fleet and escorted convoys to and from North Russia . She briefly escorted Convoy QP 8 on the return leg from Russia in March 1942 and provided distant cover for Convoy QP 10 the following month . Kent attempted to rendezvous with the damaged light cruiser Trinidad west of Bear Island as she returned from Murmansk in May , but Trinidad was sunk by German aircraft before that could happen . On 21 May the ship joined Convoy PQ 16 as part of the close escort . 
 After her return from the Soviet Union , the ship was refitted in Liverpool from 18 July to 7 November . Her catapult and quadruple .50 @-@ calibre machine guns were removed and six more single 20 mm Oerlikon guns were added . In early January 1943 the cruiser provided cover for Convoy RA 51 and , several weeks later , Convoy JW 52 . While on the latter mission , Kent was unsuccessfully attacked by the German submarine U @-@ 625 . During a brief refit between 22 September and 4 October at Chatham Dockyard , the ship exchanged six single 20 mm guns for three twin 20 mm gun mounts . In November she provided cover to Convoys RA 54A , JW 54A and JW 54B . The ship covered the outbound Convoys JW 56A , JW <unk> and the returning Convoy RA 56 in January – February 1944 . The following month Kent was part of the covering force for Convoy JW 57 . 
 On 17 July 1944 , the ship was formed part of the covering force protecting three British aircraft carriers flying off aircraft to attack the German battleship Tirpitz during Operation Mascot . Kent escorted three aircraft carriers that attacked the German airfield at Kristiansand on 10 August . She escorted two carriers on 12 September while their aircraft attacked German shipping near <unk> . On the night of 13 / 14 November 1944 , as flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor during Operation <unk> , the ship , with the light cruiser Bellona and four destroyers , attacked Convoy <unk> off <unk> , south @-@ east of Egersund , Norway . The convoy consisted of four freighters escorted by the minesweepers <unk> , <unk> and four submarine chasers . Opening fire at 2300 hrs , the cruisers and destroyers sank two of the freighters and all the escorts above except one unidentified vessel . 
 With the Naval War in the Atlantic winding down , the ship 's age and material condition , and a shortage of crews to man her ; Kent was paid off in January 1945 and remained in reserve for several years until she was used as a target . The ship was struck off the Naval List ( the first of the <unk> to go ) and allocated to BISCO on 22 January 1948 and arrived at Troon on 31 January to be broken up by West of Scotland <unk> .

 Nabeel Ahmed <unk> Rajab ( Arabic : <unk> أحمد <unk> <unk> , born on 1 September 1964 ) is a Bahraini human rights activist and opposition leader . He is president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights ( BCHR ) . He is also a prominent international human rights activist . He is a member of the Advisory Committee of Human Rights Watch 's Middle East Division , Deputy Secretary General for the International Federation for Human Rights ( FIDH ) , former chairman of CARAM Asia , member of the Advisory Board of the Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti @-@ Violence Organization ( <unk> ) , and president of Gulf Center for Human Rights ( <unk> ) . 
 Rajab started his human rights activity during the 1990s uprising before going on to become involved in campaigning on behalf of migrant workers in GCC <unk> is known for his pioneering use of social networking as an important element in human rights campaigning which has brought him into conflict with the authorities . Front Line Defenders , Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) and Reporters Without Borders have described him as being targeted by Bahraini authorities for his human rights activities . 
 During the Bahraini uprising , in which he led numerous protests , he has clashed with the political authorities and security forces . As well as criticizing the Bahraini government itself , he has also been sharply critical of the role of Bahrain 's allies , including the United States . 
 Following protests during the Formula 1 race in April 2012 that attracted media attention , Rajab was arrested and incarcerated several times . On 9 July , he was detained and sentenced to three months prison for having " insulted Bahrainis " in a Twitter message and most recently on 16 August , while still in detention , Rajab was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment on three protest @-@ related charges . The verdict has drawn criticism from Bahrain 's western allies and human rights organizations . In December , 2012 , the sentence was reduced to 2 years in prison after appeal . In December 2013 , a court denied him early release . He was released on 24 May 2014 , after serving 2 years in prison . He was re @-@ arrested on 1 October over criticizing the government on Twitter . On 2 November he was released on bail , pending his next trial on 20 January 2015 . 
 Rajab 's human rights work has been recognized internationally but within Bahraini society he remains a figure of controversy . Labeled as the informal leader of the uprising and a hero to protesters , Rajab is viewed by government supporters as a troublemaker . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Nabeel Rajab was born on 1 September 1964 in Bahrain to a middle @-@ class family . He is married and has two children . He finished his secondary school education in 1983 in Bahrain , specializing in science . He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and History from the University of Pune ( formerly University of Poona ) in India in 1987 . He earns his living as a " building contractor by trade " . In February 2012 , Rajab announced his intention to close down his business due to what he called government harassment . Nabeel Rajab is a nephew of Mohamed Hasan Jawad , one of the 13 political figures locked up for taking part in the uprising in 2011 and is also a cousin of Hussain Jawad , a prominent human rights activist arrested in February 2015 .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 In an interview with Bahrain Mirror , Rajab spoke about his earliest human rights activities while still a student at Al <unk> secondary school and described two particularly significant formative experiences : 
 Two events affected me most , one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under @-@ covered police who stormed school . The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested . That is when my voice started to rise and become annoying . I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school . So I took the easy way out and since I was the top student back then , I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school . 
 Rajab traveled to India to study Political Science and History . He received his bachelor 's degree but financial problems after his father became ill prevented him obtaining a master 's degree . He returned to Bahrain to find employment . During his college years , he remained independent of political affiliations . According to Rajab , despite lacking a clear understanding of what constitutes a culture of human rights or knowledge of human rights standards and norms , he was active within the general Bahraini students union , speaking out against all forms of injustice . He also became involved in international campaigning on specific issues . 
 According to Rajab , he became involved in organized human rights activities during the 1990s uprising in Bahrain . In 1996 Rajab discussed the idea of setting up a human rights organization with Ali <unk> and Ibrahim Kamal Al Den . They introduced him to Salman Kamal Al Den , <unk> Al <unk> , Mohammed Al <unk> and other colleagues with whom they held secret meetings . Together they founded the Bahrain Human Rights Society in 2000 . 
 = = = Foundation of Human Rights committees = = = 
 With the ending of the oppressive State Security Law period in 2000 , Rajab was able to begin working openly in the field of Human rights as one of the founders of the Bahrain Human Rights Society , one of the first human rights organizations in Bahrain . He subsequently fell out with some of the other founders . In 2002 , following wide ranging political reforms by the Bahraini government which allowed independent human rights groups to operate , Rajab worked with Abdulhadi al @-@ Khawaja and others to found the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights ( BCHR ) , a nonprofit non @-@ governmental organization which works to promote human rights in Bahrain . Rajab was Training Program Officer and Senior Researcher at BCHR . He later became Vice President and Head of International Relations until he later took over from Abdulhadi <unk> as BCHR president , a position he still held as of August 2012 . In 2011 he along with other found the Gulf Center for Human Rights . Rajab became the president of the newly found rights group . 
 = = = Migrant workers rights = = = 
 Rajab was one of the founders of the first migrant workers protection committee in the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) countries , the Migrant Workers Protection Group ( in 2003 ) . On 28 April 2007 , the Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas . BCHR issued a press release condemning this decision as discriminatory and promoting negative racist attitudes towards migrant workers . Rajab , then BCHR vice president , said : 
 It is appalling that Bahrain is willing to rest on the benefits of these people ’ s hard work , and often their suffering , but that they refuse to live with them in equality and dignity . The solution is not to force migrant workers into ghettos , but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space , and to improve the standard of living for them . 
 In October 2009 Nabeel was elected Chairperson of CARAM Asia for 2 years . CARAM is a regional non @-@ governmental organization , based in the Malaysian capital , Kuala Lumpur , that works to defend the rights of migrant workers , reduce the risks to which their communities are vulnerable , including HIV , and promote their health rights . On 24 February 2010 , Rajab addressed the " World Congress against the Death Penalty " conference in Geneva on the subject of " Migrant Workers and the Death Penalty in Bahrain & Saudi Arabia " . He drew attention to the exceptional vulnerability of migrant workers in countries with systemic abuses and rights violations .

 Since December 2009 , Nabeel has been a member of the Board of Advisors of the Middle East and North African division of Human Rights Watch , a position he still held in February 2012 . In July 2010 the International Federation for Human Rights ( FIDH ) appointed Rajab to the position of Deputy Secretary General and FIDH permanent representative in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries . He is also a member of the The Arab working group for media monitoring . 
 = = = Recognition = = = 
 In 2011 , Rajab received the Ion <unk> Democracy Award , presented annually by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars . The award citation praised him for having " worked tirelessly and at considerable personal peril to advance the cause of democratic freedoms and the civil rights of Bahraini citizens " . On 13 September , Rajab received the British Silbury Prize to " facilitate his on @-@ going humanitarian and human rights work " . In December , the Arabic American organization for democracy and human rights listed him among the fifteen " leaders of the Arab Spring " . Other activists from Bahrain included Abdulhadi al @-@ Khawaja and Mohamed al @-@ Maskati . 
 In 2012 , the BCHR led by Rajab won Index on Censorship Freedom of Expression Advocacy Award . The award sponsored by Bindmans LLP aims to " recognise campaigners or activists who have fought repression , or have struggled to challenge political climates and perceptions . " BCHR was also recipient of Roger Baldwin Medal of Liberty given by Human Rights <unk> and in 2013 it won the <unk> Prize " for their long and courageous fight for fundamental human rights " .

 According to Front Line , Rajab has been the subject of ongoing harassment since 2005 , including physical attacks and smear campaigns in the media ( official TV , radio channels , Bahrain News Agency and newspapers close to government ) . Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders have both described him as being targeted by Bahraini authorities for his human rights activities . In a postal campaign targeting Rajab and his wife thousands of letters were allegedly distributed . 
 According to an Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada report , on 15 July 2005 , Nabeel and several others were beaten by Special Forces whilst attending a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with the Committee for the Unemployed . BCHR stated that Rajab suffered a spinal injury , a broken finger , a fractured arm and a head injury and was hospitalised for two weeks as a result . 
 During a government crackdown in the summer of 2010 , Rajab 's photograph was published a number of times by the pro @-@ government Al @-@ Watan Newspaper accusing him of supporting a terrorist network and being " active in publishing false reports and information " . Gulf Daily News also published Rajab 's photo naming him as one of the " supporters " of aforementioned network . A few days later , the Bahrain News Agency published a PowerPoint file about the alleged terrorist network . According to BCHR and Human Rights Watch , the file referred to Rajab as having been officially accused of involvement in the terrorist network . The claim was removed the following day . 
 During this time , the authorities imposed a ban preventing Rajab from engaging in any new business in Bahrain that made it difficult for him to earn a living . The ban was subsequently lifted without any official explanation . In mid @-@ August 2010 , a number of opposition activists were again arrested . According to Rajab , an order for his arrest was issued on 8 September but was cancelled on 18 October . Rajab was also subject to a travel ban during this period .

 = = = Background = = = 
 Beginning in February 2011 , Bahrain saw sustained pro @-@ democracy protests , centered at Pearl Roundabout in the capital of Manama , as part of the wider Arab Spring . Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February ( later known as Bloody Thursday ) , which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured . Protests continued for a month reaching over 100 @,@ 000 participants in a nation of about 500 @,@ 000 citizens , until more than a thousand troops and police from the Gulf Cooperation Council arrived at the request of government and a three @-@ month state of emergency was declared . Authorities then cracked down on the protests . However , smaller @-@ scale protests and clashes continued to occur almost daily , mostly in areas outside Manama 's business districts , with some rare marches in the center of the capital city . As of April 2012 , more than 80 people had died since the start of the uprising and as of January 2013 , near @-@ daily clashes between protesters and police are ongoing . 
 = = = Role in the uprising = = = 
 Throughout the uprising Rajab was a " vocal critic of the human rights violations " . He was one of the few who kept criticizing the government during state of emergency . Unlike other opposition parties who organized protests in Shia villages , Rajab insisted on staging them within the capital . He led many protests , several of them in Manama , putting him in standoffs with security forces . Rajab was named by Al Jazeera English the " unofficial leader of the 14 February movement " and The Atlantic labelled him " the de @-@ facto leader of Bahrain 's resurgent uprising . " Rajab said he was a normal activist and that he was not engaged in planning for protests . Despite acknowledging it was " dangerous and costly " , he expressed happiness about his role in the uprising . 
 On the other hand , Foreign Policy mentioned that a big portion of the Sunni community think of Rajab as a troublemaker . The majority sect in Bahrain is Shia Muslims , Sunni Muslims comprise a substantial minority and hold the top positions of power . The largest opposition party is Al Wefaq which is a Shia Islamist movement ( albeit internationally recognized as moderate and tightly allied with secular opposition parties ) . One source of opposition to Rajab ( who has taken anti @-@ sectarian stands ) and his movement is the fear ( particularly among Sunnis ) that they could bring Shia Islamists to power . 
 In the early hours of 20 March 2011 , a group of 20 to 25 masked men , some armed with rifles and accompanied by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces , broke into Rajab 's house . Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated . He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him into the back of a vehicle before verbally abusing , beating and threatening to rape him . He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he loved the prime minister . He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in <unk> , a suburb of Manama . After being briefly questioned about someone he did not know , he was released . 
 On 10 April , officials publicly accused Rajab of fabricating photos posted on his Twitter account of the body of Ali Isa Ibrahim Saqer , who died in detention on 9 April . The Ministry of Interior announced that Rajab would be referred to the Military Prosecutor for legal action . The photos showed slash marks all over Saqer 's back and other signs of physical abuse , and were also stated to be accurate by an HRW researcher who had seen the body prior to burial . Five prison guards were subsequently charged with Saqer 's death . 
 In incidents on 18 April , 21 May and 15 December , tear gas grenades were fired at Rajab 's house in the village of Bani Jamra by unknown assailants . In the first incident , HRW identified the grenades thrown into the Rajab family 's compound as US @-@ manufactured munitions to which only Bahrain 's security forces would have had access . Tear gas penetrated into the adjacent home of Rajab 's 78 @-@ year @-@ old mother who suffers from respiratory disease , causing her great distress . On 21 May , four gas grenades were fired at the house . This time , according to Rajab , the grenades were smaller than those used in the mid @-@ April assault and there were no marks identifying the manufacturer . 
 According to the BCHR , authorities organized an anonymous smear campaign targeting Rajab and Maryam al @-@ Khawaja in May 2011 . Later in the month Rajab stated that his uncle , Mohammad Hassan Mohammad Jawad ( 65 years old ) , an arrested activist , was being tortured because of their relationship . He also stated that he was prevented by Muharraq airport security staff from traveling to Beirut to attend an International Freedom of Expression Exchange ( IFEX ) meeting in May and an Amnesty International conference in June . 
 On 31 May , just after the King of Bahrain had called for dialogue without preconditions to begin in early July the military National Safety Court issued an order for Rajab 's arrest along with those of prominent Al Wefaq parliamentarians . Rajab was accused of spreading false news and statements about the situation in Bahrain and promoting hatred and disrespect of a specific religious sect , in addition to humiliating the king of Bahrain . All the detainees were released the same day . 
 In November , Rajab took part in a six @-@ member international fact finding mission . It released a 27 @-@ page report and gave eleven recommendations addressing human rights violations in Bahrain . In December , Rajab and two other human rights activists received death threats on Twitter by a retired security official . On 6 January 2012 , after leading a night peaceful protest in <unk> el @-@ <unk> in Manama , Rajab was hospitalized and briefly detained with injuries from an alleged beating , which the opposition blamed on security forces . Via their Twitter account , the Ministry of the Interior denied the accusation , saying police found Rajab " lying on the ground " and referred him to hospital . 
 On 12 February , Rajab was briefly detained after he tried to march along with his family to the location of the symbolic Pearl Roundabout in Manama . Rajab explained that he took this move to be a model to encourage people from different ages to take part in protests . Following the media attention on protests during the Formula 1 race in April 2012 , the government launched a " legal crackdown " in which Rajab was arrested and released several times .

 On 5 May , Rajab was arrested at Bahrain International Airport on his arrival from Lebanon the day before a scheduled court hearing relating to a march he had attended in March . Julian Assange said he believed Rajab 's arrest was linked to his appearance on Assange 's World Tomorrow television talk @-@ show and Project on Middle East Democracy ( POMED ) associated it with an interview with the BBC 's HARDtalk . The following day the Ministry of the Interior issued a statement that Rajab had been arrested for " committing a number of crimes " . Before the arrest , Rajab had stated he would not attend the trial , because the Judiciary of Bahrain was " a tool used against human rights defenders and people calling for democracy and justice " . 
 On 6 May , Rajab was charged with " insulting a statutory body via Twitter , " his lawyer said . The online newspaper Manama Voice identified Rajab 's tweets criticizing the Ministry of Interior as the likely cause . The Tweet suggested the ministry did not carry out " proper investigations into civilian deaths , " which was already confirmed by BICI report that labelled the findings of the Interior Ministry , in general , as " in many cases , flawed and biased in its favour . " 
 Rajab pleaded not guilty to the charge against him , but the prosecutor decided to keep him in detention for 7 days . On 12 May , the public prosecution extended his detention by one week . On 16 May , fifty @-@ five lawyers were present in court in solidarity with Rajab who pleaded not guilty again and stated that the charge against him was " malicious " . Despite being granted bail on 20 May , Rajab was kept in detention on a further charge of " organizing illegal protests " . Activists accused the Bahraini authorities of trying to find any way of keeping Rajab off the streets . 
 Spokesman of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said she was concerned at the arrest of Rajab . The Australian Senate unanimously passed a ruling demanding their government to " [ m ] <unk> direct representations to Bahraini authorities for the immediate release of Nabeel Rajab . " Amnesty International designated Rajab a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate and unconditional release . Human rights groups Arab Program for Human Rights Activists , BCHR , Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies , FIDH , Freedom House , <unk> , and the political party Al Wefaq demanded his release . Bahrain Forum for Human Rights called Ban Ki @-@ moon , the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations to intervene for the release of Rajab . Political cartoonist Carlos <unk> created a cartoon about Rajab . 
 On 28 May , spending twenty four days in detention , Rajab was released on bail and placed on a travel ban . 
 = = = June 2012 arrest = = = 
 After being briefly released , Rajab was re @-@ arrested on 6 June on a charge of " publicly insulting residents of a Sunni @-@ dominated neighbourhood for their ties to the ruling dynasty " , the fifth charge brought against him in a period of one month . Human Rights Watch and other rights group participating in Bahrain 's Universal Periodic Review session demanded release of Rajab . He was released on bail on 27 June still facing three charges relating to Twitter activity and two about organizing " illegal " protests . 
 = = = July 2012 arrest = = = 
 On 7 July , Rajab was banned from traveling , and two days later he was arrested by more than a dozen of masked security personnel from his house few hours after a court sentenced him to three @-@ month prison for a Tweet out of six in which he criticized the prime minister that the court found had insulted Bahrainis . The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders described the arrest as an " arbitrary detention " . In the Tweet Rajab said " everyone knows you [ prime minister ] are not popular and if it weren ’ t for the need for money , [ the Muharraq residents ] would not have welcomed you . " The charge was " publicly vilifying the people of al @-@ Muharraq and questioning their patriotism with disgraceful expressions posted via social networking websites . " 
 Rajab 's lawyer said the verdict was unexpected because the charge of insult was normally punished by a fine . Human Rights First , Human Rights Watch and nineteen members of the United States Congress called for Rajab 's release . Four Bahraini rights group issued a joint statement condemning the sentence and five political parties held a sit @-@ in in solidarity with Rajab . Yousif al @-@ Mahafdha of BCHR said " [ t ] hey arrested him to send a message to all activists that you will get arrested like him if you talk to the media " . 
 The appeal was scheduled for 23 August , when Rajab was acquitted of the charge , but remained in custody on another sentence . According to the Bahrain News Agency , the judge decided to release Rajab , because " he was not satisfied with the evidence put forward " . During the trial , Rajab complained of " physical and psychological torture " in prison and solitary confinement in a " dark cell " , his lawyer reported . 
 = = = August 2012 sentence = = = 
 On 16 August , Rajab was sentenced to one year in prison on each of three charges for a total of three years . Charges were " involvement in illegal practices and inciting gatherings and calling for unauthorized marches through social networking sites " , " participation in an illegal assembly " , and " participation in an illegal gathering and calling for a march without prior notification . " Public prosecutors stated that Rajab 's " provocation of his supporters " had incited violence , including the road blockades and petrol bomb attacks . " The Public Prosecution produced evidence that the accused had called in public speeches for a demonstration to confront public security personnel , inciting violence and escalation against law enforcement officers , resulting in deaths during those confrontations " , a public prosecutor said . The appeal was scheduled to take place on 10 September . Rajab was placed in Jaw prison . On 20 August , he was allowed to make a two @-@ minute call to his family . He told them he was in solitary confinement with no access to newspapers .

 Samira Rajab , the country 's Minister of State for Information ( and Rajab 's cousin twice over ) declared that Rajab had enjoyed a fair trial with unrestricted access to legal assistance . She said that action had been taken against him because although claiming to be a human rights activist he had in fact been engaging in political activity , a justification similar to that offered by an officially @-@ appointed MP for the trial of Bahrain health workers . 
 Rajab 's wife accused the minister of lying to the international media and fabricating film footage played during a press conference . She said that the court proceedings had clearly demonstrated the absence of justice and an independent judiciary . Rajab 's son quoted his father as saying , " Jail me 3 years or 30 , I will never give up " . Mr. <unk> , Rajab 's lawyer , said the government was " sending a message " , further emphasised by the King of Bahrain 's speech that week referring to a duty to " protect peaceful , good @-@ natured citizens who do not seek to usurp power " . 
 BCHR said that the only reason Rajab had been targeted was to prevent him from continuing his legitimate and peaceful human rights work . The Al Wefaq political party said Rajab 's sentence was further evidence of the government 's unwillingness to find a solution to the crisis , noting that political detainees were prisoners of conscience and the regime had no right to use them as hostages " as part of its security solution to the ongoing political crisis " . Justin Gengler , a Bahrain researcher based in Qatar , remarked that Bahrain 's ' reformist ' king was unfortunately beginning to sound eerily like his uncle . A number of political and human rights activists held a sit @-@ in in solidarity with Rajab at National Democratic Action Society headquarters on 18 August . On 31 August , thousands of protesters filled a three @-@ kilometer highway chanting for the release of Rajab . 
 = = = = International reactions = = = = 
 A number of independent United Nations experts including the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of peaceful assembly and of association expressed serious concern about the government of Bahrain 's " campaign of persecution " directed against rights activists and called for Nabeel Rajab 's immediate release . They urged the Bahraini authorities to respect the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression and release anyone arbitrarily detained for exercising legitimate freedoms without delay . 
 The United States and European Union criticized the sentence . A United States Department of State spokesperson described the sentence as deeply troubling , affirming the fundamental freedom of all to participate in civil acts of peaceful disobedience . The State Department called on the government of Bahrain " to take steps to build confidence across Bahraini society " and " begin a really meaningful dialogue with the political opposition and civil society " as actions like Rajab 's sentencing would cause further divisions within Bahraini society . 
 Sanjeev <unk> of Amnesty International criticized the US reaction as late and insufficient . He highlighted Michael Posner 's testimony in which he stated that Rajab 's case was " a bit more complicated " and Victoria <unk> 's answers to reporters in which " it took [ her ] so long " to call for Rajab 's release . FIDH said the US reaction was " woefully insufficient " and that it was " turn [ ing ] a blind eye to human rights violations in Bahrain " . BCHR criticized the US " silent reaction " towards the arrest . " [ T ] he lack of pressure from the US administration appears to be linked with the Bahraini government ’ s willingness to escalate , " it added . 
 The European Union noted the verdict with concern and expected it to be " reconsidered in the appeal process " . A spokesperson for the French Foreign Office affirmed the right of freedom of expression and called for dialogue as a mean to solve the political crisis . " We are disturbed by the harsh sentence imposed on Mr. Rajab and hope it will be reviewed on appeal , " spokesperson added . A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office expressed concern at the length of the sentence and called on opposition activists to avoid inciting " violence or other illegal acts " . " We urge the Bahraini Government to act proportionately in all cases . The right of individuals to peaceful protest and freedom of expression is a fundamental part of any modern democracy and must be respected , " spokesperson added . 
 The sentence was sharply criticized by rights groups . Forty three rights groups signed a joint appeal to release Rajab . Brian Dooley of Human Rights First found the verdict shocking even by Bahrain 's " abysmal " standards on human rights . He added that the regime could not be seen as serious about human rights reform when it jailed one of the world 's most prominent activists to prison for three years . Referring to a " dark day for justice " in Bahrain , Amnesty International said that the use of such blatant ruthless tactics to suppress dissenting voices could leave the international community under no illusion that Bahrain was on the path of reform . Human Rights Watch argued that the government had yet to show that Rajab had done any more than exercise his right to free expression and peaceful assembly and demanded his release . 
 FIDH , Front Line Defenders , Gulf Centre for Human Rights , Index on Censorship , IFEX , Julian Assange , Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights , Reporters Without Borders and World Organization Against Torture criticized the sentence and called for Rajab 's immediate release . Jane Kinninmont of Chatham House reported speculation that the case might be used as a political bargaining chip in efforts to prepare the ground for a fresh political dialogue urged by Bahrain 's western allies . She added that the verdict sends " a signal that the government is taking a harder line on protests . " History professor Toby C. Jones said the sentence " represents the end of any pretense of reforms " in Bahrain . 
 = = = = Trial of Appeal = = = = 
 On 11 December 2012 , the court of appeal reduced the sentence of Rajab to two years in prison after it cleared him from insulting police . The court however upheld the charge of " illegal gathering " . Rajab had expected to be released , according to his wife . The United States Assistant Secretary of State , Michael Posner called the Bahraini authorities to drop all charges related to non @-@ violent activism . <unk> Stork of HRW criticized the judiciary as being " very politicized " and called the court decision " bizarre " . 
 The Gulf Center for Human Rights said that the defense team had faced many obstacles during the trial of appeal including that the International experts who were introduced to the court as defense witnesses were denied entry at Bahrain international airport , and the defense team were denied access to the evidences submitted by the prosecution . Amnesty International ’ s director for the Middle East and North Africa commented that “ The appeal court ’ s gesture to reduce Nabeel Rajab ’ s sentence by one year is completely hollow given that he shouldn ’ t be serving any time in prison in the first place ” . Other human rights organizations , including Human Rights First , Front Line Defenders , the International Federation for Human Rights ( FIDH ) and the World Organisation Against Torture ( <unk> ) condemned the ruling of the court of appeal and called for the immediate release of Nabeel Rajab . 
 In December 2013 , a court denied Rajab early release after he had served three quarters of his sentence . According to Bahraini law , a prisoner may be eligible for early release after serving three quarters of the sentence . Rajab 's lawyer stated that the court gave no reason for rejecting early release . 
 = = = = Release = = = = 
 On 24 May 2014 , Rajab was released from prison after serving his full term of 2 years . FIDH welcomed the move , with its Secretary General Amina <unk> travelling to Bahrain to meet Rajab as soon as he was released . " It is an immense pleasure to see our friend and colleague Nabeel again . We have been waiting for this moment for a very long time , " <unk> said . Rajab was happy to be out and called for the release of other prisoners and for " respect for human rights " . 
 = = = October 2014 arrest = = = 
 On 1 October Rajab was arrested after being summoned to the Criminal Investigation Directorate . He had just returned from a two @-@ month advocacy campaign in Europe in which he criticized the government and called for international action against it . He was charged with " publicly insulting official institutions " after he had criticized the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense on Twitter for allegedly being the " first ideological incubator " of Bahrainis who had joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) . A month earlier , one security officer at Ministry of Interior was terminated from employment after joining ISIL and calling on other officers to defect . The Public Prosecutor said Rajab had acknowledged publishing the comments on Twitter . 
 On his first hearing on 19 October , Rajab denied charges against him . He was released on the second hearing on 2 November with the next hearing scheduled for 20 January . Rajab said he was targeted because of his peaceful advocacy for human rights and democracy and that he does not have any regrets for doing so . 
 = = = Criticism of the United States = = = 
 Rajab was critical of the US role in Bahrain throughout the uprising . On 26 July 2011 , in an interview with Al Jazeera English , he expressed disappointment at US silence and the inconsistent way in which US standards of democracy and human rights were applied to countries which they had problems but not to dictatorships with whom they had good relations . On 21 December 2011 , in an interview with National Post , he criticized US support for royal dictatorships in the region and contrasted the hard attitude shown towards Syria and Libya with the soft attitude towards allies . 
 In a World Tomorrow episode broadcast on 8 May 2012 , Rajab accused the US of opposing democracy in Bahrain when it asked Russia not to sell arms for Syria while selling arms to Bahrain , and in July , shortly before Rajab 's arrest , he noted that the presence of US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain made the struggle against the monarchy more difficult because US support , accompanied by the support , or silence , of the international community , was seen as giving the green light for repression and attacks on human rights defenders . 
 = = Online activity = = 
 Rajab is an active user of online media in his human rights work , in particular social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter . He stopped posting in Internet forums in order to encourage support for social network @-@ based campaigning . He devotes significant time and effort to his Twitter account , created in March 2009 , posting mostly in Arabic , and in the 2011 Forbes magazine list of the 100 top Arabs on Twitter was ranked number 43 , with 36 @,@ 040 followers ( currently about 175 @,@ 000 - September 2012 ) . He ranked number 2 in Bahrain behind Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa . 
 Even though on this occasion Rajab was personally congratulated by the Minister , his use of Twitter to publicise human rights abuses has brought him into repeated conflict with the authorities . In April 2011 he was threatened with prosecution for the publication on his Twitter account of an allegedly fabricated image of the body of Ali Issa Saqer showing signs of torture in custody ; the threats were withdrawn after prison guards were charged with Saqer 's death . The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( <unk> ) described the threat against Rajab of the first ever charge in the Arab world involving " tweeting " ( publishing information on Twitter ) as an illustration of the Bahraini government 's implacable hostility towards freedom of expression and Internet freedom . 
 In 2012 Rajab 's Twitter @-@ based campaigning led firstly to his detention for three weeks ( two weeks on the charge of " insulting a statutory body via Twitter " and another week for " organizing illegal protests " ) after he published tweets critical of the Ministry of Interior ( leading to criticism of the authorities by international human rights organizations ) , then to a three @-@ month prison sentence for a Tweet criticizing the prime minister , and eventually in August 2012 he was given three further consecutive one @-@ year prison sentences for illegal political activities involving the use of social networking sites . On 23 August , spending more than half of his sentence , Rajab was acquitted of Twitter charge in which he criticized the prime minister , but remained in jail while appealing the other prison sentence .

 The show begins with Beyoncé taking the stage stating " This is going to be a little different , y 'all . It 'll be more intimate , " before she begins revealing multiple stories from her musical history including before — auditions with Destiny 's Child starting at age nine , her father 's early and frequent involvement managing his daughter 's career and getting dropped by Elektra . After delving into her musical history , Beyoncé states " I just want to have a good time with y 'all , " before she begins the revue 's set list with her rendition of Michael Jackson 's " I Wanna Be Where You Are " . Following her rendition of " I Wanna Be Where You Are " , Beyoncé begins a medley of past Destiny 's Child hits , stopping each track to discuss her life and mindset during each stage of her career . During her performance of " Independent Women " she reveals how her father , Matthew Knowles , submitted the track to the Charlie 's Angels ( 2000 ) soundtrack without permission , reveals that she wanted to write a song " that celebrates a woman 's curves " inspired by Stevie Nicks ' guitar riff in " Edge of Seventeen " ( 1982 ) for " Bootylicious " and states " With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity ... they were being nasty but it inspired me " before performing " Survivor " . 
 After " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " , the final song in the medley , Beyoncé began to tell the story of how her first album came to be , stating " [ The label ] told me I didn 't have one hit song on my album . I guess they were kinda right . I had five ! " Beyoncé than continued with a slowed @-@ down , jazzier version of " Crazy in Love , " allowing the orchestra to augment rather than transform the tracks . During the Ne @-@ Yo penned " Irreplaceable , " Beyoncé has the crowd assist her in her performance . After stating " On April 4 , 2008 , somebody put a ring on it , " Beyoncé has the audience , which contained both men and women ranging from ages 8 to 38 , flip their hands to the Billboard Hot 100 number one hit , " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " .

Beyoncé than continues down the original track listing of 4 , following " 1 + 1 " with a rendition of " I Care " where she whipped her hair to the brooding brass and ominous beat of the song , while bringing the song to life with immaculate vocals .

" Best Thing I Never Had " follows afterwards , with a slight alteration in the songs melody . Beyoncé then slow @-@ winds to " Party " as the crowd swayed their arms back and forth and stretched out the " y " to every other verse .

 Live at Roseland : Elements of 4 received positive reviews by music critics , who praised the performances of the songs , Beyoncé 's vocal abilities and its documentary style . Nate Chinen of The New York Times compared the DVD with the album Live at the Royal Albert Hall ( 2011 ) by British singer Adele which was also released on November 25 , 2011 . He noted that the albums " share some intriguing affinities " , commenting : " Naturally there 's the valorization of powerful , agile singing ; there are explicit expressions of gratitude , amid an implicit air of conquest . <unk> , too , there 's the suggestion of performance as testimony , the set list as personal narrative . In both cases the theme of female self @-@ empowerment plays out , sometimes a bit awkwardly , against the fact of an unnamed but specific male partner . " However , Chien commented that Live at Roseland : Elements of 4 " makes an airtight spectacle out of movement . " USA Today 's Elysa Gardner mentioned the DVD along with Adele 's Live at the Royal Albert Hall as the leading DVDs for December 2011 . 
 Kat George of VH1 gave a positive review for the album , describing the scenes as " moving , inspirational and infectious " while also calling them " immaculately produced . " She further wrote that " Tight and succinct , there 's no filler in the Live At Roseland DVD — it 's high energy from the beginning to the end , and doesn 't give you a chance to lag or lose interest . " George went on to describe the album as " intimate " , which according to her gives " the magic of Beyoncé — even when she 's speaking to the masses , she 's really speaking to you , and you alone . " She finished her review saying that the album gives a personal evening with Beyoncé along with " absolute grace and ultimate humility . " Sian @-@ Pierre Regis of MTV described the album as a " glitzy doc @-@ style flick " and noted that Beyoncé shows her " softer " side while also calling her a " gift that keeps on giving . " Entertainment Weekly 's Melissa Maerz wrote that " According to ... DVD Live at Roseland : Elements of 4 ... [ which ] finds Beyoncé telling her life story through her songs ... [ she ] has done a whole lot of amazing things in her life . " Gordon Smart of The Sun praised the romance between Beyoncé and Jay @-@ Z during the DVD , noting that it was interesting to see Beyoncé talking about her love life because she has always kept her private life in secret . J. J. <unk> and Donna <unk> of Daily Mail praised the fact that the DVD shows Beyoncé " from eager five @-@ year @-@ old music fan to a consummate entertainer " . 
 Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine noted , " It 's [ Live at Roseland : Elements of 4 ] being called her most personal work to date , and from the looks of it , that assessment isn 't too far off . " Writing for The Wrap , Chris Willman compared the album with the American documentary show This Is Your Life . Willman also commented that the album was " highly impressive , and almost all a little annoying , if solipsism isn 't your thing " and that " even at her most egotistical , she 's [ Beyoncé ] strangely never less than utterly likeable . She might actually be the world 's most good @-@ natured megalomaniac . " He also called Beyoncé " fairly glorious " and noted that " the live versions of the ' 4' material are more invigorating than the studio equivalents , with Beyoncé 's eight @-@ piece all @-@ female band making everything sound like the great cross @-@ pollination of contemporary urban and ' 70s soul you 'd hope for .

 Weeks later , Augustus tells Hazel that he has traced Van Houten 's assistant , Lidewij ( Lotte Verbeek ) , and has corresponded with Van Houten by email . Hazel then writes to him to find out more about the novel 's ambiguous ending and Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person . Overwhelmed and excited , Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him , but Frannie rejects it because of financial and medical constraints .

On their way back to the hotel , Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience . The three visit the Anne Frank House , where Hazel struggles to climb the house 's many stairs . At the end of the tour , Augustus and Hazel kiss to the applause of many fellow tourists . They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time . The next day while out in the city , Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has relapsed , has spread throughout his body and is terminal . Hazel is heartbroken , expressing how unfair life can be . 
 After their return to Indianapolis , Augustus ' health worsens each week . Hazel receives a desperate call from him late at night after he tries to get a new pack of cigarettes at the gas station . He is taken to the ICU for a few days and realizes he is close to death . Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac ( Nat Wolff ) and Hazel to his pre @-@ funeral , where they deliver eulogies they 've both prepared .

[ and so ] Hazel effectively repudiates her nihilism and materialism as she responds across the barrier of death to Gus ’ s ' okay ' " . He also said , " [ Is ] this film a satisfying presentation of Christianity ? Hardly . But for those who are struggling to find their way to meaning and faith , it 's not an entirely bad place to start . "

In 1978 , Boeing unveiled three new models : the twin @-@ engine Boeing 757 to replace its venerable 727 , the twin @-@ engine 767 to challenge the Airbus A300 , and a trijet 777 concept to compete with the DC @-@ 10 and L @-@ 1011 . The mid @-@ size 757 and 767 launched to market success , due in part to 1980s extended @-@ range twin @-@ engine operational performance standards ( ETOPS ) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations . These regulations allowed twin @-@ engine airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours ' distance from emergency diversionary airports . Under ETOPS rules , airlines began operating the 767 on long @-@ distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners . The trijet 777 was later dropped , following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants . Boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the 767 @-@ 300ER and the 747 @-@ 400 . 
 By the late 1980s , DC @-@ 10 and L @-@ 1011 models were approaching retirement age , prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs . McDonnell Douglas was working on the MD @-@ 11 , a stretched and upgraded successor of the DC @-@ 10 , while Airbus was developing their A330 and A340 . In 1986 , Boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767 , tentatively named 767 @-@ X , to target the replacement market for first @-@ generation wide @-@ bodies like the DC @-@ 10 , and to complement existing 767 and 747 models in the company lineup . The initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the existing 767 , along with winglets . Later plans expanded the fuselage cross @-@ section but retained the existing 767 flight deck , nose , and other elements . 
 Airline customers were unimpressed with the 767 @-@ X proposals , and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross @-@ section , fully flexible interior configurations , short- to intercontinental @-@ range capability , and an operating cost lower than any 767 stretch . Airline planners ' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific , adding to the heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers . By 1988 , Boeing realized that the only answer was a new design , which became the 777 twinjet . The company opted for the twin @-@ engine configuration given past design successes , projected engine developments , and reduced @-@ cost benefits . On December 8 , 1989 , Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777 . 
 = = = Design effort = = = 
 The design phase for the new twinjet was different from Boeing 's previous commercial jetliners . For the first time , eight major airlines – All Nippon Airways , American Airlines , British Airways , Cathay Pacific , Delta Air Lines , Japan Airlines , Qantas , and United Airlines – had a role in the development . This was a departure from industry practice , where manufacturers typically designed aircraft with minimal customer input . The eight airlines that contributed to the design process became known within Boeing as the " Working Together " group . At the first group meeting in January 1990 , a 23 @-@ page questionnaire was distributed to the airlines , asking what each wanted in the design . By March 1990 , Boeing and the airlines had decided upon a basic design configuration : a cabin cross @-@ section close to the 747 's , capacity up to 325 passengers , flexible interiors , a glass cockpit , fly @-@ by @-@ wire controls , and 10 percent better seat @-@ mile costs than the A330 and MD @-@ 11 . Boeing selected its Everett factory in Washington , home of 747 production , as the 777 's final assembly site . 
 On October 14 , 1990 , United Airlines became the 777 's launch customer when it placed an order for 34 Pratt & Whitney @-@ powered aircraft valued at US $ 11 billion with options on an additional 34 . The development phase coincided with United 's replacement program for its aging DC @-@ 10s . United required that the new aircraft be capable of flying three different routes : Chicago to Hawaii , Chicago to Europe , and non @-@ stop from Denver , a hot and high airport , to Hawaii . ETOPS certification was also a priority for United , given the overwater portion of United 's Hawaii routes . In January 1993 , a team of United developers joined other airline teams and Boeing designers at the Everett factory . The 240 design teams , with up to 40 members each , addressed almost 1 @,@ 500 design issues with individual aircraft components . The fuselage diameter was increased to suit Cathay Pacific , the baseline model grew longer for All Nippon Airways , and British Airways ' input led to added built @-@ in testing and interior flexibility , along with higher operating weight options . 
 The 777 was the first commercial aircraft designed entirely by computer . Each design drawing was created on a three @-@ dimensional CAD software system known as CATIA , sourced from Dassault <unk> and IBM . This lets engineers assemble a virtual aircraft , in simulation , to check for interference and verify that the thousands of parts fit properly — thus reducing costly rework . Boeing developed their own high @-@ performance visualization system , <unk> , later called <unk> ( Integrated Visualization Tool ) to support large @-@ scale collaborative engineering design reviews , production illustrations , and other uses of the CAD data outside of engineering . Boeing was initially not convinced of CATIA 's abilities and built a physical mock @-@ up of the nose section to verify its results . The test was so successful that additional mock @-@ ups were canceled . 
 = = = Production and testing = = = 
 The production process included substantial international content , an unprecedented level of global subcontracting for a Boeing jetliner , later exceeded by the 787 . International contributors included Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries ( fuselage panels ) , Fuji Heavy Industries , Ltd . ( center wing section ) , Hawker de Havilland ( elevators ) , and Aerospace Technologies of Australia ( rudder ) . An agreement between Boeing and the Japan Aircraft Development Corporation , representing Japanese aerospace contractors , made the latter risk @-@ sharing partners for 20 percent of the entire development program . The initial 777 @-@ 200 model was launched with propulsion options from three manufacturers , General Electric , Pratt & Whitney , and Rolls @-@ Royce , giving the airlines their choice of engines from competing firms . Each manufacturer agreed to develop an engine in the 77 @,@ 000 lbf ( 340 kN ) and higher thrust class ( a measure of jet engine output ) for the world 's largest twinjet . 
 To accommodate production of its new airliner , Boeing doubled the size of the Everett factory at the cost of nearly US $ 1 @.@ 5 billion to provide space for two new assembly lines . New production methodologies were developed , including a turn machine that could rotate fuselage subassemblies 180 degrees , giving workers access to upper body sections . Major assembly of the first aircraft began on January 4 , 1993 . By the start of production , the program had amassed 118 firm orders , with options for 95 more from 10 airlines . Total investment in the program was estimated at over US $ 4 billion from Boeing , with an additional US $ 2 billion from suppliers . 
 On April 9 , 1994 , the first 777 , line number <unk> , was rolled out in a series of 15 ceremonies held during the day to accommodate the 100 @,@ 000 invited guests . The first flight took place on June 12 , 1994 , under the command of chief test pilot John E. Cashman . This marked the start of an 11 @-@ month flight test program that was more extensive than testing for any previous Boeing model . Nine aircraft fitted with General Electric , Pratt & Whitney , and Rolls @-@ Royce engines were flight tested at locations ranging from the desert airfield at Edwards Air Force Base in California to frigid conditions in Alaska , mainly Fairbanks International Airport . To satisfy ETOPS requirements , eight 180 @-@ minute single @-@ engine test flights were performed . The first aircraft built was used by Boeing 's nondestructive testing campaign from 1994 to 1996 , and provided data for the -200ER and -300 programs . At the successful conclusion of flight testing , the 777 was awarded simultaneous airworthiness certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) and European Joint Aviation Authorities ( JAA ) on April 19 , 1995 . 
 = = = Entry into service = = = 
 Boeing delivered the first 777 to United Airlines on May 15 , 1995 . The FAA awarded 180 @-@ minute ETOPS clearance ( " ETOPS @-@ 180 " ) for the Pratt & Whitney <unk> @-@ engined aircraft on May 30 , 1995 , making it the first airliner to carry an ETOPS @-@ 180 rating at its entry into service . The first commercial flight took place on June 7 , 1995 , from London Heathrow Airport to Dulles International Airport near Washington , D.C. Longer ETOPS clearance of 207 minutes was approved in October 1996 . 
 On November 12 , 1995 , Boeing delivered the first model with General Electric GE90 @-@ 77B engines to British Airways , which entered service five days later . Initial service was affected by gearbox bearing wear issues , which caused British Airways to temporarily withdraw its 777 fleet from transatlantic service in 1997 , returning to full service later that year ; General Electric subsequently announced engine upgrades . 
 The first Rolls @-@ Royce Trent 877 @-@ powered aircraft was delivered to Thai Airways International on March 31 , 1996 , completing the introduction of the three powerplants initially developed for the airliner . Each engine @-@ aircraft combination had secured ETOPS @-@ 180 certification from the point of entry into service . By June 1997 , orders for the 777 numbered 323 from 25 airlines , including satisfied launch customers that had ordered additional aircraft . Operations performance data established the consistent capabilities of the twinjet over long @-@ haul transoceanic routes , leading to additional sales . By 1998 , the 777 fleet had approached 900 @,@ 000 flight hours . Boeing states that the 777 fleet has a dispatch reliability ( rate of departure from the gate with no more than 15 minutes delay due to technical issues ) above 99 percent . 
 = = = Initial derivatives = = = 
 After the original model , Boeing developed an increased gross weight variant of the 777 @-@ 200 with greater range and payload capability . Initially named 777 @-@ <unk> , the 777 @-@ 200ER first flew on October 7 , 1996 , received FAA and JAA certification on January 17 , 1997 , and entered service with British Airways on February 9 , 1997 . Offering greater long @-@ haul performance , the variant became the most widely ordered version of the aircraft through the early 2000s . On April 2 , 1997 , a Malaysia Airlines -200ER named " Super Ranger " broke the great circle " distance without landing " record for an airliner by flying eastward from Boeing Field , Seattle to Kuala Lumpur , a distance of 10 @,@ 823 nautical miles ( 20 @,@ 044 km ) , in 21 hours and 23 minutes . 
 Following the introduction of the -200ER , Boeing turned its attention to a stretched version of the airliner . On October 16 , 1997 , the 777 @-@ 300 made its first flight . At 242 @.@ 4 ft ( 73 @.@ 9 m ) in length , the -300 became the longest airliner yet produced ( until the A340 @-@ 600 ) , and had a 20 percent greater overall capacity than the standard length model . The -300 was awarded type certification simultaneously from the FAA and JAA on May 4 , 1998 , and entered service with launch customer Cathay Pacific on May 27 , 1998 . 
 From the program 's start , Boeing had considered building ultra @-@ long @-@ range variants . Early plans centered on a 777 @-@ <unk> proposal , a shortened variant of the -200 with reduced weight and increased range , similar to the 747SP . However , the <unk> would have carried fewer passengers than the -200 while having similar operating costs , leading to a higher cost per seat . By the late 1990s , design plans shifted to longer @-@ range versions of existing models . A more powerful engine in the 100 @,@ 000 lbf ( 440 kN ) and higher thrust class was required , leading to talks between Boeing and engine manufacturers . General Electric offered to develop the GE90 @-@ 115B engine , while Rolls @-@ Royce proposed developing the Trent 8104 engine . In 1999 , Boeing announced an agreement with General Electric , beating out rival proposals . Under the deal with General Electric , Boeing agreed to only offer GE90 engines on new 777 versions . 
 = = = Longer @-@ range models = = = 
 On February 29 , 2000 , Boeing launched its next @-@ generation twinjet program , initially called 777 @-@ X , and began issuing offers to airlines . Development was slowed by an industry downturn during the early 2000s . The first model to emerge from the program , the 777 @-@ 300ER , was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France , along with additional commitments . On February 24 , 2003 , the -300ER made its first flight , and the FAA and EASA ( European Aviation Safety Agency , successor to the JAA ) certified the model on March 16 , 2004 . The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29 , 2004 . The -300ER , which combined the -300 's added capacity with the -200ER 's range , became the top @-@ selling 777 variant in the late 2000s , benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four @-@ engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs . 
 The second long @-@ range model , the 777 @-@ 200LR , rolled out on February 15 , 2005 , and completed its first flight on March 8 , 2005 . The -200LR was certified by both the FAA and EASA on February 2 , 2006 , and the first delivery to Pakistan International Airlines occurred on February 26 , 2006 . On November 10 , 2005 , the first -200LR set a record for the longest non @-@ stop flight of a passenger airliner by flying 11 @,@ 664 nautical miles ( 21 @,@ 602 km ) eastward from Hong Kong to London . Lasting 22 hours and 42 minutes , the flight surpassed the -200LR 's standard design range and was logged in the Guinness World Records . 
 The production freighter model , the 777F , rolled out on May 23 , 2008 . The maiden flight of the 777F , which used the structural design and engine specifications of the -200LR along with fuel tanks derived from the -300ER , occurred on July 14 , 2008 . FAA and EASA type certification for the freighter was received on February 6 , 2009 , and the first delivery to launch customer Air France took place on February 19 , 2009 . 
 Initially second to the 747 as Boeing 's most profitable jetliner , the 777 became the company 's most lucrative model in the 2000s . Program sales accounted for an estimated US $ 400 million of Boeing 's <unk> earnings in 2000 , US $ 50 million more than the 747 . By 2004 , the airliner comprised the bulk of wide @-@ body revenues for the Boeing Commercial Airplanes division . In 2007 , orders for second @-@ generation 777 models approached 350 aircraft , and in November of that year , Boeing announced that all production slots were sold out to 2012 . The program backlog of 356 orders was valued at US $ 95 billion at list prices in 2008 . 
 = = = Production updates and improvements = = = 
 In 2010 , Boeing announced plans to increase production from 5 aircraft per month to 7 aircraft per month by mid @-@ 2011 , and 8 @.@ 3 per month by early 2013 . Complete assembly of each 777 @-@ 300ER requires 49 days . In November 2011 , assembly began on the 1,000th 777 , a -300ER model for Emirates ; which was rolled out in March 2012 . In late 2011 , the FAA assigned a common type rating to the 787 and 777 , allowing pilots qualified on either aircraft to operate both models , due to related design features . The smaller 787 was the first stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project . Reportedly , the 777 could eventually be replaced by a new aircraft family , Yellowstone 3 , which would draw upon technologies from the 787 . 
 By the late 2000s , the 777 was facing increased potential competition from Airbus ' planned A350 XWB and internally from proposed 787 variants , both airliners that promise fuel efficiency improvements . As a consequence , the 777 @-@ 300ER received an engine and aerodynamics improvement package for reduced drag and weight . In 2010 , the variant further received a 5 @,@ 000 lb ( 2 @,@ 300 kg ) maximum zero @-@ fuel weight increase , equivalent to a higher payload of 20 – 25 passengers ; its GE90 @-@ <unk> engines received a 1 – 2 @.@ 5 percent thrust enhancement for increased takeoff weights at higher @-@ altitude airports . More changes were targeted for late 2012 , including possible extension of the wingspan , along with other major changes , including a composite wing , new powerplant , and different fuselage lengths . Emirates was reportedly working closely with Boeing on the project , possibly being the launch customer for new 777 versions . China Airlines ordered ten 777 @-@ 300ER aircraft to replace 747 @-@ 400s on routes between Taipei and Los Angeles and New York City , telling Aviation Week and Space Technology that the 777 @-@ 300ER 's per seat cost is about 20 % lower than the 747 's costs ( varying due to fuel prices ) . Four of the 777 aircraft were already flying as of February 2015 . 
 Mindful of the long time required to bring the 777X to the market , Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency , as well as lower prices for the existing product . As of February 2015 , the backlog of undelivered 777s totals 278 aircraft , representing just under three years of current production at 8 @.@ 3 aircraft per month , causing Boeing to ponder the 2018 @-@ 2020 time frame . In January 2015 , United Airlines ordered 10 Boeing 777 @-@ 300ERs , normally costing around $ 150 million each but paid around $ 130 million , a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X . Boeing has worked with General Electric to offer a 2 % improvement in fuel efficiency to new aircraft beginning in 2016 . GE will improve the fan module and the high pressure compressor stage @-@ 1 <unk> in the GE @-@ 90 @-@ 115 turbofan , as well as reduce clearances between the tips of the turbine blades and the shroud during cruise . These improvements , of which the latter is the most important and was derived from work to develop the 787 , will , GE says , lower fuel burn by 0 @.@ 5 % . Boeing 's wing modification will deliver the remainder . Boeing stated that every 1 % improvement in the 777 @-@ 300ER 's fuel burn translates into being able to fly the aircraft another 75 nautical miles on the same load of fuel , or add ten passengers or 2 @,@ 400 lb of cargo to a " load limited " flight . 
 In March 2015 , additional details of the improvement package were published in Aviation Week & Space Technology . The 777 @-@ 300ER is to shed 1 @,@ 800 lb . Boeing will replace the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels , similar to those used on the 787 . New flight control software is to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless of the extent to which pilots command the elevators . Boeing is also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing . The outboard raked wingtip is to have a divergent trailing edge , described as a " poor man 's airfoil " by Boeing ; this originally developed for the McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 12 project . Another change involves elevator trim bias . These changes are to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane , increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5 % . 
 = = = 777X program = = = 
 In September 2011 , Boeing released more details on proposed third @-@ generation 777 versions , collectively referred to as 777X and tentatively designated 777 @-@ 8 and 777 @-@ 9 . The 777 @-@ 9 was to feature a fuselage stretch of 7 @.@ 0 ft ( 2 @.@ 13 m ) to a total length of 250 ft 11 in ( 76 @.@ 5 m ) to accommodate 407 passengers , while the ultra long @-@ range 777 @-@ 8 , a replacement for the 777 @-@ 200LR , was slated to be 228 @.@ 17 ft ( 69 @.@ 5 m ) in length . Wingspan for both models was expected to increase from the current 212 ft 7 in ( 64 @.@ 8 m ) to 234 ft ( 71 @.@ 3 m ) , and incorporate the use of carbon @-@ fiber @-@ reinforced polymer in its construction . In February 2012 , General Electric disclosed studies on a new engine , dubbed the GE9X , to power the 777X . Rolls @-@ Royce and Pratt & Whitney also proposed powerplants for the 777X , including the <unk> concept , based on the Trent 1000 and Trent XWB engines , and an adaptation of <unk> engine architecture to produce up to 100 @,@ 000 lbf ( 440 kN ) of thrust . However , in March 2013 the General Electric GE9X was selected as the exclusive engine to power the 777X . 
 In May 2013 , Boeing 's board of directors gave formal permission for its Commercial Airplanes division to start offering the 777X to customers . The 777X program includes two models : the 777 @-@ 9 , which is stretched beyond the length of the 777 @-@ 300ER , and the 777 @-@ 8 , which is sized close to the 777 @-@ 300ER but with ultra @-@ long range capability . On September 19 , 2013 , Lufthansa 's supervisory board gave approval to order 34 Boeing 777 @-@ 9 aircraft to replace their 747 @-@ 400s , in advance of the program 's official launch . In October 2013 , Boeing announced that its U.S. facilities in Charleston , Huntsville , Long Beach , Philadelphia , and St. Louis as well as Russian facilities in Moscow would support the 777X design effort . 
 Boeing officially launched the 777X at the 2013 Dubai Airshow in November 2013 , announcing a total of 259 orders and commitments worth more than US $ 95 billion , constituting the largest product launch by dollar value in the history of commercial aviation . These included orders for 150 aircraft from Emirates , 25 aircraft from Etihad Airways , and 50 aircraft from Qatar Airways ; the former two orders encompass both 777 @-@ 8 and 777 @-@ 9 variants and the latter is entirely for the 777 @-@ 9 . By April 2014 , with cumulative sales surpassing those of the 747 , the 777 became the best @-@ selling wide @-@ body airliner ; at existing production rates , the aircraft was on track to become the most @-@ delivered wide @-@ body airliner by mid @-@ 2016 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Boeing introduced a number of advanced technologies with the 777 design , including fully digital fly @-@ by @-@ wire controls , fully software @-@ configurable avionics , Honeywell LCD glass cockpit flight displays , and the first use of a fiber optic avionics network on a commercial airliner . Boeing made use of work done on the cancelled Boeing <unk> regional jet , which utilized similar versions of the chosen technologies . In 2003 , Boeing began offering the option of cockpit electronic flight bag computer displays . In 2013 , Boeing announced that the upgraded 777X models would incorporate airframe , systems , and interior technologies from the 787 . 
 = = = Fly @-@ by @-@ wire = = = 
 In designing the 777 as its first fly @-@ by @-@ wire commercial aircraft , Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to <unk> controllers as used in many fly @-@ by @-@ wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners . Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls , the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models . The fly @-@ by @-@ wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection , a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer @-@ calculated framework of operating parameters , acting to prevent stalls , <unk> , and excessively stressful maneuvers . This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary . The fly @-@ by @-@ wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup . 
 = = = Airframe and systems = = = 
 The wings on the 777 feature a supercritical airfoil design that is swept back at 31 @.@ 6 degrees and optimized for cruising at Mach 0 @.@ 83 ( revised upward after flight tests to Mach 0 @.@ 84 ) . The wings are designed with increased thickness and a longer span than previous airliners , resulting in greater payload and range , improved takeoff performance , and a higher cruising altitude . The wings also serve as fuel storage , with longer @-@ range models able to carry up to 47 @,@ 890 US gallons ( 181 @,@ 300 L ) of fuel . This capacity allows the 777 @-@ 200LR to operate ultra @-@ long @-@ distance , trans @-@ polar routes such as Toronto to Hong Kong . In 2013 , a new wing made of composite materials was introduced for the upgraded 777X , with a wider span and design features based on the 787 's wings . 
 Large folding wingtips , 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 40 m ) long , were offered when the 777 was first launched , to appeal to airlines who might use gates made to accommodate smaller aircraft , but no airline purchased this option . Folding wingtips reemerged as a design feature at the announcement of the upgraded 777X in 2013 . Smaller folding wingtips of 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 35 m ) in length will allow 777X models to use the same airport gates and taxiways as earlier 777s . These smaller folding wingtips are less complex than those proposed for earlier 777s , and internally only affect the wiring needed for wingtip lights . 
 The airframe incorporates the use of composite materials , which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight ( all models outside the 777 @-@ 8 and 777 @-@ 9 ) . Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder . The main fuselage cross @-@ section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade @-@ shaped tail cone with a port @-@ facing auxiliary power unit . The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner . The six @-@ wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear . This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft 's braking and hydraulic systems . Each tire of a 777 @-@ 300ER six @-@ wheel main landing gear can carry a load of 59 @,@ 490 lb ( 26 @,@ 980 kg ) , which is heavier than other wide @-@ bodies such as the 747 @-@ 400 . The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing . A ram air turbine – a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power – is also fitted in the wing root fairing . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The original 777 interior , also known as the Boeing Signature Interior , features curved panels , larger overhead bins , and indirect lighting . Seating options range from six abreast in first class up to 10 across in economy . The 777 's windows were the largest of any current commercial airliner until the 787 , and measure 15 @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) by 10 @-@ inch ( 250 mm ) in size ( all models outside the 777 @-@ 8 and <unk> ) . The cabin also features " <unk> Zones " , which entails deliberate placement of water , electrical , pneumatic , and other connection points throughout the interior space , allowing airlines to move seats , galleys , and lavatories quickly and more easily when adjusting cabin arrangements . Several aircraft have also been fitted with VIP interiors for non @-@ airline use . Boeing designed a hydraulically damped toilet seat cover hinge that closes slowly . 
 In 2003 , Boeing introduced overhead crew rests as an option on the 777 . Located above the main cabin and connected via staircases , the forward flight crew rest contains two seats and two bunks , while the aft cabin crew rest features multiple bunks . The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing wide @-@ body and narrow @-@ body aircraft , including <unk> , 747 @-@ 400 , 757 @-@ 300 , and newer 767 models , including all 767 @-@ 400ER models . The 747 @-@ 8 and 767 @-@ 400ER have also adopted the larger , more rounded windows of the original 777 . 
 In 2011 , Flight International reported that Boeing is considering replacing the Signature Interior on the 777 with a new interior similar to that on the 787 , as part of a move towards a " common cabin experience " across all Boeing platforms . With the launch of the 777X in 2013 , Boeing confirmed that the aircraft would be receiving a new interior featuring 787 cabin elements and larger windows . Further details released in 2014 included re @-@ sculpted cabin sidewalls for greater interior room , noise @-@ dampening technology , and higher cabin humidity . 
 = = Variants = = 
 Boeing uses two characteristics , fuselage length and range , to define their 777 models . Fuselage length affects the number of passengers and amount of cargo that can be carried ; the 777 @-@ 200 and derivatives are the base size , and the aircraft was stretched into the 777 @-@ 300 in 1998 . In terms of range , the aircraft has been categorized into three segments based on design criteria . The A @-@ market would cover domestic and regional operations , the B @-@ market would cover routes from Europe to the US West coast and the C @-@ market the longest transpacific routes . 
 These were initially defined as the following : 
 A @-@ market : up to 4 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 800 km ) 
 B @-@ market : 6 @,@ 600 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 200 km ) 
 C @-@ market : 7 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 400 km ) 
 When referring to different variants , Boeing and airlines often collapse the model number ( 777 ) and the variant designator ( -200 or -300 ) into a truncated form ( e.g. , " 772 " or " 773 " ) . The International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) aircraft type designator system adds a preceding manufacturer letter ( e.g. , " <unk> " or " <unk> " ) . Subsequent to the capacity number , designations may or may not append the range identifier ( e.g. , 777 @-@ 300ER as " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " , or " <unk> " ) . These notations may be found in aircraft manuals or airline timetables .

 The 777 @-@ 200 was the initial A @-@ market model . The first -200 was delivered to United Airlines on May 15 , 1995 . With a maximum range of 5 @,@ 240 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 700 km ) , the -200 was chiefly aimed at U.S. domestic airline operators . Nine different -200 customers have taken delivery of 88 aircraft , with 79 in airline service as of July 2015 . A British Airways 777 @-@ 200 became the fastest subsonic New York to London flight at 5 hours and 16 minutes in January 2015 due to strong winds . The competing aircraft from Airbus is the A330 @-@ 300 . 
 = = = 777 @-@ 200ER = = = 
 The 777 @-@ 200ER ( " ER " for Extended Range ) , the B @-@ market version of the -200 , was originally known as the 777 @-@ <unk> ( increased gross weight ) . The -200ER has additional fuel capacity and an increased maximum takeoff weight ( MTOW ) over the -200 . Aimed at international airlines operating transatlantic routes , the -200ER 's maximum range is 7 @,@ 730 nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 320 km ) . In addition to breaking the eastbound great circle " distance without landing " record , the -200ER also holds the record for the longest ETOPS @-@ related emergency flight diversion ( 177 minutes under one engine ) , on a United Airlines flight carrying 255 passengers on March 17 , 2003 , over the Pacific Ocean . 
 The first -200ER was delivered to British Airways on February 6 , 1997 . Singapore Airlines , one of the type 's largest customers , ordered over half of its <unk> with reduced engine thrust specifications ( de @-@ rated ) for use on medium @-@ length routes . The de @-@ rated engines lower MTOW , which reduces the aircraft 's purchase price and landing fees , and can be re @-@ rated to full -200ER standard for long @-@ haul operations . As of June 2016 , -200ER deliveries to 33 different customers totaled 422 with no unfilled orders . As of July 2015 , 390 examples of the -200ER were in airline service . The competing aircraft from Airbus are the A340 @-@ 300 and the A350 @-@ 900 . 
 = = = 777 @-@ 200LR = = = 
 The 777 @-@ 200LR ( " LR " for Longer Range ) , the C @-@ market model , became the world 's longest @-@ range commercial airliner upon entering service in 2006 . Boeing named it <unk> as it could connect almost any two airports in the world , although it remains subject to ETOPS restrictions . It holds the world record for the longest nonstop flight by a commercial airliner , having a maximum range of 9 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 600 km ) . The -200LR was intended for ultra @-@ long @-@ haul routes such as Los Angeles to Singapore . 
 Developed alongside the -300ER , the -200LR features an increased MTOW and three optional auxiliary fuel tanks in the rear cargo hold . Other new features include raked wingtips , redesigned main landing gear , and additional structural strengthening . As with the -300ER and 777F , the -200LR is equipped with wingtip extensions of 12 @.@ 8 ft ( 3 @.@ 90 m ) . The -200LR is powered by GE90 @-@ <unk> or GE90 @-@ 115B turbofans . The first -200LR was delivered to Pakistan International Airlines on February 26 , 2006 . As of June 2016 , eleven different -200LR customers have taken delivery of 59 aircraft , with no unfilled orders . Airlines operated 55 of the -200LR variant as of July 2015 . The closest competing aircraft from Airbus was the A340 @-@ <unk> . 
 = = = 777 @-@ 300 = = = 
 The stretched 777 @-@ 300 was designed as an A @-@ market replacement for 747 @-@ 100s and 747 @-@ 200s . Compared to the older 747s , the stretched 777 has comparable passenger capacity and range , but burns one @-@ third less fuel and has 40 percent lower maintenance costs . The -300 features a 33 @.@ 3 ft ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) fuselage stretch over the baseline -200 . This allows seating for up to 550 passengers in a single class high @-@ density configuration , an arrangement adopted for heavily trafficked Japanese routes . Because of the aircraft 's length , the -300 is equipped with a tailskid and ground maneuvering cameras to aid pilots during taxi . The maximum range is 6 @,@ 015 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 140 km ) , allowing the -300 to operate trunk routes previously flown by older 747s . 
 After being certified simultaneously by the FAA and JAA , the first -300 was delivered to Cathay Pacific on May 21 , 1998 . Eight -300 customers have taken delivery of 60 aircraft , 58 of which were in service as of July 2015 . However , following the introduction of the longer @-@ range -300ER in 2004 , operators have selected that variant instead . The -300 has no direct Airbus rival , but the A340 @-@ 600 was offered in competition . 
 = = = 777 @-@ 300ER = = = 
 The 777 @-@ 300ER ( " ER " for Extended Range ) is the C @-@ market version of the -300 , its higher MTOW and increased fuel capacity permits a maximum range of 7 @,@ 370 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 650 km ) with 396 passengers in a two @-@ class seating arrangement . The 777 @-@ 300ER features raked and extended wingtips , a strengthened fuselage and wings and a modified main landing gear . Its wings have an aspect ratio of 9 @.@ 0 . It is powered by the GE90 @-@ 115B turbofan , the most powerful jet engine with a maximum thrust of 115 @,@ 300 lbf ( 513 kN ) . Following flight testing , aerodynamic refinements have reduced fuel burn by an additional 1 @.@ 4 % . 
 Since its launch , the model has been a primary driver of the twinjet 's sales past the rival A330 / 340 series , its direct competitors have included the Airbus A340 @-@ 600 and the A350 @-@ 1000 . Using two engines produces a typical operating cost advantage of around 8 – 9 % for the -300ER over the A340 @-@ 600 . Several airlines have acquired the -300ER as a 747 @-@ 400 replacement amid rising fuel prices given its 20 % fuel burn advantage . 
 The first -300ER was delivered to Air France on April 29 , 2004 . The -300ER is the best @-@ selling 777 variant , having surpassed the -200ER in orders in 2010 and deliveries in 2013 . As of June 2016 , -300ER deliveries to 41 different customers totalled 660 , with 140 unfilled orders . In February 2016 , 619 <unk> are in service within 35 operators . 
 = = = 777 Freighter = = = 
 The 777 Freighter ( 777F ) is an all @-@ cargo version of the twinjet , and shares features with the -200LR ; these include its airframe , engines , and fuel capacity . With a maximum payload of 226 @,@ 000 lb ( 103 @,@ 000 kg ) , cargo capacity is similar to the 243 @,@ 000 lb ( 110 @,@ 000 kg ) of the 747 @-@ 200F . The freighter has a range of 4 @,@ 900 nmi ( 9 @,@ 070 km ) at maximum payload , although greater range is possible if less cargo weight is carried . 
 As the aircraft promises improved operating economics compared to older freighters , airlines have viewed the 777F as a replacement for freighters such as the 747 @-@ 200F , MD @-@ 10 , and MD @-@ 11F . The first 777F was delivered to Air France on February 19 , 2009 . As of June 2016 , 123 freighters had been delivered to 16 different customers , with 35 unfilled orders . Operators had 108 of the 777F in service as of July 2015 . 
 In the 2000s , Boeing began studying the conversion of 777 @-@ 200ER and -200 passenger airliners into freighters , under the name 777 BCF ( Boeing Converted Freighter ) . The company has been in discussion with several airline customers , including FedEx Express , UPS Airlines , and GE Capital Aviation Services , to provide launch orders for a 777 BCF program . 
 = = = 777 @-@ 8 and <unk> = = = 
 The 777 @-@ 8 and the larger 777 @-@ 9 , are the two variants which comprise the Boeing 777X program , launched in 2013 . Both models incorporate a new carbon @-@ fiber @-@ reinforced polymer wing with folding wingtips , a wider , more comfortable redesigned cabin , and other upgraded systems . Service entry of the first 777X variant , the 777 @-@ 9 , is scheduled for 2020 . 
 = = = Government and corporate = = = 
 Versions of the 777 have been acquired by government and private customers . The main purpose has been for VIP transport , including as an air transport for heads of state , although the aircraft has also been proposed for other military applications . 
 777 Business Jet ( 777 VIP ) – the Boeing Business Jet version of the 777 that is sold to corporate customers . Boeing has received orders for 777 VIP aircraft based on the 777 @-@ 200LR and 777 @-@ 300ER passenger models . The aircraft are fitted with private jet cabins by third party contractors , and completion may take 3 years . 
 777 Tanker ( KC @-@ 777 ) – the KC @-@ 777 is a proposed tanker version of the 777 . In September 2006 , Boeing announced that it would produce the KC @-@ 777 if the United States Air Force ( USAF ) required a larger tanker than the KC @-@ 767 , able to transport more cargo or personnel . In April 2007 , Boeing offered its 767 @-@ based KC @-@ 767 Advanced Tanker instead of the KC @-@ 777 to replace the smaller Boeing KC @-@ 135 Stratotanker under the USAF 's KC @-@ X program . Boeing officials have described the KC @-@ 777 as suitable for the related KC @-@ Z program to replace the wide @-@ body McDonnell Douglas KC @-@ 10 Extender . 
 In 2014 , the Japanese government chose to procure two 777 @-@ 300ERs to serve as the official air transport for the Emperor of Japan and Prime Minister of Japan . The aircraft , to be operated by the Japan Air Self @-@ Defense Force under the callsign Japanese Air Force One , are scheduled to enter service in 2019 and replace two 747 @-@ 400s . Besides VIP transport , the 777s are also intended for use in emergency relief missions . 
 777s have served as official government transports for nations including Gabon ( VIP @-@ configured 777 @-@ 200ER ) , Turkmenistan ( VIP @-@ configured 777 @-@ 200LR ) , and the United Arab Emirates ( VIP @-@ configured 777 @-@ 200ER and 777 @-@ 300ER operated by Abu Dhabi Amiri Flight ) . Prior to returning to power as Prime Minister of Lebanon , Rafic Hariri acquired a 777 @-@ 200ER as an official transport . 
 In 2014 , the USAF examined the possibility of adopting modified 777 @-@ 300ERs or 777 @-@ <unk> to replace the Boeing 747 @-@ 200 aircraft used as Air Force One . Although the USAF had preferred a four engine aircraft , this was mainly due to precedent ( the existing aircraft were purchased when the 767 was just beginning to prove itself with ETOPS ; decades later , the 777 and other twin jets established a comparable level of performance as quad @-@ jet aircraft ) . Ultimately , the air force decided against the 777 , and selected instead the Boeing 747 @-@ 8 to be the next presidential aircraft . 
 = = Operators = = 
 Boeing customers that have received the most 777s are ILFC , Emirates , Singapore Airlines , United Airlines , and Air France . Emirates is the largest airline operator as of July 2015 , and is the only customer to have operated all 777 variants produced , including the -200 , -200ER , -200LR , -300 , -300ER , and 777F . The 1,000th 777 off the production line , a -300ER set to be Emirates ' 102nd 777 , was unveiled at a factory ceremony in March 2012 . 
 A total of 1 @,@ 265 aircraft ( all variants ) were in airline service as of July 2015 , with Emirates ( 144 ) , United Airlines ( 74 ) , Cathay Pacific ( 68 ) , Air France ( 66 ) , American Airlines ( 64 ) , British Airways ( 58 ) , All Nippon Airways ( 57 ) , Singapore Airlines ( 55 ) , and other operators with fewer aircraft of the type .

 As of October 2015 , the 777 has been in 14 aviation accidents and incidents , including four hull @-@ loss accidents , one hull @-@ loss due to criminal act , and three hijackings , for a total of 540 fatalities . Before 2013 , the only fatality involving the twinjet occurred in a refueling fire at Denver International Airport on September 5 , 2001 , during which a ground worker had sustained fatal burns . The aircraft , operated by British Airways , suffered fire damage to the lower wing panels and engine housing ; it was later repaired and returned to service . 
 The type 's first hull @-@ loss occurred on January 17 , 2008 , when British Airways Flight 38 , a 777 @-@ 200ER with Rolls @-@ Royce Trent 895 engines flying from Beijing to London , crash @-@ landed approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) short of Heathrow Airport 's runway 27L and slid onto the runway 's threshold . There were 47 injuries and no fatalities . The impact damaged the landing gear , wing roots and engines . The aircraft was written off . Upon investigation , the accident was blamed on ice crystals from the fuel system clogging the fuel @-@ oil heat exchanger ( <unk> ) . Two other minor momentary losses of thrust with Trent 895 engines occurred in 2008 . Investigators found these were also caused by ice in the fuel clogging the fuel @-@ oil heat exchanger . As a result , the heat exchanger was redesigned . 
 The type 's second hull @-@ loss occurred on July 29 , 2011 , when EgyptAir Flight 667 a 777 @-@ 200ER registered as SU @-@ GBP suffered a cockpit fire while parked at the gate at Cairo International Airport . The plane was successfully evacuated with no injuries , and airport fire teams extinguished the fire . The aircraft sustained structural , heat and smoke damage . This aircraft was written off . Investigators focused on a possible electrical fault with a supply hose in the cockpit crew oxygen system . 
 On July 6 , 2013 , Asiana Airlines Flight 214 , 777 @-@ 200ER registered <unk> , crashed while landing at San Francisco International Airport after touching down short of the runway . Surviving passengers and crew evacuated before fire destroyed the aircraft . The crash led to the death of three of the 307 people on board . These were the first fatalities in a crash involving a 777 since entering service in 1995 . The NTSB accident investigation concluded in June 2014 that the pilots committed 20 to 30 minor to significant errors in their final approach , and that complexities of the automated controls contributed to the accident . 
 On March 8 , 2014 , Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , 777 @-@ 200ER registered 9M @-@ MRO , carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew , en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing was reported missing . Air Traffic Control 's last reported coordinates for the aircraft were over the South China Sea at 6 ° 55 ′ 15 ″ N 103 ° 34 ′ 43 ″ E. After the search for the aircraft began , Malaysia 's prime minister announced on March 24 , 2014 that after analysis of new satellite data it is now to be assumed " beyond reasonable doubt " that the plane was lost and there were no survivors . As of July 2015 , the cause remains unknown , but the Malaysian Government declared it was an accident in January 2015 . On July 29 , 2015 an aircraft piece was found on the French island of Réunion . The piece was sent to France where it was later identified as the flaperon of a Boeing 777 . On August 5 , 2015 Malaysian authorities confirmed that the piece was in fact from Flight 370 . 
 On July 17 , 2014 , Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 , a 777 @-@ 200ER registered 9M @-@ MRD , bound for Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam broke up in mid @-@ air and crashed in the Donetsk province in eastern Ukraine , after being hit by an anti @-@ aircraft missile .

 = American Creation = 
 American Creation : Triumphs and Tragedies at the Founding of the Republic is a 2007 non @-@ fiction book written by American historian Joseph Ellis and published by Alfred A. Knopf , examining the successes and failures of the Founding Fathers . Structured episodically , the book examines six turning points in the early history of the United States : the writing of the Declaration of Independence , George Washington 's winter at Valley Forge , James Madison 's debate with Patrick Henry over Constitutional ratification , Washington 's treaty with Creek leader Alexander McGillivray , Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's founding of the Democratic @-@ Republican Party , and the Louisiana Purchase . 
 Ellis , who had previously won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for History , wanted to write a book portraying the Founders neither as demigods nor villains , but as flawed men who were improvising in response to immediate crises . The book reached # 4 on The New York Times Best Seller list , and received largely positive reviews from critics . 
 = = Background = = 
 Joseph Ellis is an American professor of history who held an endowed Ford Foundation Chair at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts . His previous works on the Founding Fathers had received several awards , including a 1997 National Book Award for American Sphinx : The Character of Thomas Jefferson and the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for History for his Founding Brothers : The Revolutionary Generation . American Creation was his sixth book . 
 Ellis states in American Creation 's foreword that the book was prompted by repeated questions he received on his 2000 book tour for Founding Brothers negatively comparing presidential candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore to the Founders . His difficulty in properly assessing the Founders made him want to write a book that both acknowledged their achievements and punctured the myth that they were " demigods " . He stated in an interview that he wanted to show that " these folks didn 't completely understand what they were doing ... They were improvising on the edge of catastrophe . " Ellis did the research for the book personally , rather than working with research assistants . He wrote the manuscript by hand with a <unk> pen . 
 = = Content = = 
 American Creation consists of a prologue , six chapters , and an afterword . In the prologue , Ellis discusses what he calls the " stunning achievement " of the Founders in creating a nation that became " the accepted global formula for national success " . He criticizes the " wildly extravagant claims and equally hyperbolic counterclaims " that deify or vilify the Founders , particularly those of academic historians who treat the Founders as " racists , <unk> , and <unk> " . In contrast , Ellis states his intention to present a balanced portrayal of Founders — acknowledging their successes , such as the creation of a nation @-@ sized , secular republic governed by political parties , as well as their failures to deal with slavery and to reach a just settlement with Native Americans . 
 The book 's first chapter , " The Year " , examines the Declaration of Independence as well as the American Revolutionary War . Ellis discusses how , " latently and surreptitiously " , the Declaration held more long @-@ term revolutionary implications than the Founders realized . The second chapter , " The Winter " , discusses General George Washington 's achievement in holding the Continental Army together during a hard winter at Valley Forge . The army 's poor condition causes a critical shift in strategy that would prove decisive for the Americans , forcing Washington to attempt to control the countryside rather than stage a decisive battle with the British . 
 The third chapter , " The Argument " , details James Madison 's efforts to secure a strong federal government at the 1787 Constitutional Convention . Madison fails to win approval for a national government that can veto state laws , and initially considers the convention a failure . Instead the Constitution creates a political system in which sovereignty is shared and " blurred " , providing a framework for ongoing debate . Madison emphasizes this advantage , as well as the weakness of the prior Articles of Confederation government during the Revolutionary War , to defeat Anti @-@ Federalist orator Patrick Henry in a debate over Virginia 's ratification of the Constitution . Chapter Four , " The Treaty " , considers Washington 's failure as president to reach an equitable settlement with Native Americans , with particular consideration to his treaty with Creek leader Alexander McGillivray . Though Washington declares the issue one of his highest priorities and successfully negotiates a treaty , it proves worthless in the face of the relentless expansion of white settlers into Creek territory , the intransigence of the Georgian legislature , and McGillivray 's attempts to ally with Spain . Ellis calls the inability to make a fair peace with Native Americans " the greatest failure of the revolutionary generation " , second only to their failure to end slavery . 
 The fifth chapter , " The Conspiracy " , presents the achievement of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in creating American party politics by forming the Democratic @-@ Republican Party . Even as he works to undermine Washington 's administration from within , however , Jefferson disparages party politics and denies that he is capable of acting in a partisan fashion , thus failing to understand his own accomplishment . " The Purchase " , the book 's final chapter , explores the story behind the 1803 Louisiana Purchase , discussing President Jefferson 's achievement in making the Purchase but also his failure to prohibit slavery in the new territory . Ellis argues that Jefferson thus set the nation on the course that would lead to the Civil War , and that as a result , " tragedy trumped triumph in the story of the Purchase " . In the afterword , Ellis states that " perhaps the most creative act of the founding era " was " an expanding liberal mandate that left room , up ahead , for an Abraham Lincoln and a Martin Luther King to join the list of founders . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 American Creation sold well on release , rising to # 4 on the The New York Times Best Seller list in November 2007 . 
 Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review , stating , " This subtle , brilliant examination of the period between the War of Independence and the Louisiana Purchase puts Pulitzer @-@ winner Ellis ( Founding Brothers ) among the finest of America 's narrative historians . " Jon Meacham , reviewing the book for The New York Times , called the book " illuminating " , writing that it goes " beyond the familiar critique of the founding to explore a point that remains underappreciated : that America was constructed to foster arguments , not to settle them " . Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times also praised the book , writing that " It is Ellis 's achievement that he leaves us with a keen appreciation of the good fortune America had in having the right men in the right places at the right times " . 
 In the Chicago Tribune , Debby Applegate stated that " ' American Creation ' is one of the most enjoyable and thought @-@ provoking books I 've read in years . " Cindy <unk> , writing in the New Hampshire Business Review , said of the book , " Filled with powerful , masterfully drawn word @-@ pictures and eye @-@ opening insights , Ellis 's ' American Creation ' should be a must @-@ read for anyone prior to going to the voting polls ... ' American Creation ' lets us know we still have much to learn from , both good and bad , from the founding of our nation " . 
 In The Boston Globe , H.W. Brands called Ellis " the reigning master of the episodic approach to history " ; he complimented the book 's style but disagreed with Ellis ' conclusion that blurred sovereignty was one of the Constitution 's greatest strengths . Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post wrote that he felt Ellis ' portrait of the Founders was largely accurate , but that in his reading of the slavery issue , he was " a trifle guilty of the ' <unk> ' -- seeing the past through the prism of the present -- that he elsewhere deplores " . Reviewing for The Christian Science Monitor , Randy Dotinga wrote that the book 's close examination of " dry and tedious " political debates " makes for rough sledding at times " , and criticized Ellis ' dismissal of academic historians . However , he concluded that " Ellis 's sharp writing style and appreciation for irony are saving graces " . 
 = Landcruisin ' = 
 " Landcruisin ' " is a song by English musician Anup Paul , professionally known as A.K. Paul . It was released as his debut solo single on 24 March 2016 . Written and produced by Paul , it is an R & B track backed by synths , guitars and percussion , whose sonority was likened to that of various artists . 
 It is the first release of Paul Institute , a platform founded by A.K. Paul and his brother Jai Paul . The song premiered on Zane Lowe 's Beats 1 radio show before receiving digital , streaming , and 7 @-@ inch vinyl releases . Most music critics gave the song favorable reviews , comparing it to the works of Prince , D 'Angelo , and Miguel , saying it matched expectations . However , a minority of reviewers dismissed it as inferior to the works of Jai Paul . It managed to enter the Billboard Twitter Emerging Artists chart . 
 = = Background = = 
 A.K. Paul 's first single as a main performer was a 2014 collaboration with English singer Nao on the title track of her So Good EP . Until then , he had written and produced songs for other artists , including " Next to Me " by Emeli Sandé and " Flesh " by Miguel . He was also involved in the recording of his brother Jai Paul 's two singles " <unk> ( Demo ) " and " Jasmine " . Journalists have characterised A.K. Paul as " elusive " and observed that until the release of " Landcruisin ' " , he has preferred " hanging out in the shadows " . " Landcruisin ' " was recorded at the Spicy Benefit Studio and The <unk> in London . A.K. Paul produced , engineered , mixed , and mastered the song , which features his songwriting , instrumentation , and programming . He is also responsible for the song 's sound design and effects . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Landcruisin ' " was categorized by critics as an R & B song . The song opens with the sound of horns and a motorbike engine , described by Connick as " the perfect opening salvo " , progressing into an ever @-@ changing " sexy and slightly abrasive groove " . Instrumentation is provided by synthesisers reminiscent of science fiction and Hong Kong action cinema , glam rock @-@ influenced guitars , and " curiously evolving shuffle @-@ percussion " , which includes what Aurora Mitchell of Spin described as a : " clacking pinball lever drum " . Mitchell felt that " Landcruisin ' " sounded like : " the soundtrack to the opening scene of an action film " . Tom Connick , writing for DIY , elaborated : 
 ( ... ) it ’ s top speed , glitching electronics that drag everything along . Backed by <unk> swells of bass , it comes off like Hans Zimmer chucking his Inception soundtrack through a blender , A.K. lending his yearning vocal to give a human edge to all the razor @-@ edged sound . 
 Critics have suggested affinities between " Landcruisin ' " and the works of other artists . Marc Hogan of Pitchfork considered D 'Angelo 's third studio album Black Messiah ( 2014 ) as an inspiration for the song ; Chris Kelly wrote in Fact that it reminds him of " Miguel circa Art Dealer Chic " . Additionally , Prince was frequently cited by journalists reviewing the track , as exemplified by <unk> contributor David Cornish analysing " Landcruisin ' " as " a blockbuster soundscape " characterised by " overdrive riffs " and " lyrical tones " resemblant of the aforementioned artist .

 On 21 March 2016 , Pitchfork Media reported that Jai and A.K. Paul had created the Paul Institute . Although the nature of this project was not disclosed at the time , a press release revealed that it is a collaboration between the brothers , and artist Muz Azar , with the intent of also potentially introducing other artists . Devoid of information , its website prompted visitors to provide their country and telephone number in order to receive a <unk> which granted access to updates . DIY writer Tom Connick commented on the attention the project captured saying : " With little effort and even less output , Jai and A.K. Paul quickly built up the kind of mystique thousands of bedroom producers and their pricey publicists would kill for . Zane Lowe premiered " Landcruisin ' " three days later on his Beats 1 radio programme , where it was played three consecutive times ; he described it as " Blade Runner pop " . The song was made available that day for Paul Institute members through digital download and streaming , while public SoundCloud and iTunes releases were enabled on 25 March . A limited @-@ edition , autographed 7 " vinyl record , exclusive to registered users of the Paul Institute , was also released . 
 " Landcruisin ' " garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics . Pitchfork Media 's Marc Hogan opined that the song " both lives up to the expectations and sidesteps them " , writing : " With a sound like this , why stay on land ? " Similarly , Collin Brennan , of Consequence of Sound , said it was " totally worth all the buzz " , and Stereogum writer James Rettig dubbed the track : " more than good enough on its own , an enticing and theatrical piece of futuristic pop music " . Fact published a review of " Landcruisin ' " , to which five journalists contributed with commentary , and their score out of 10 points .

 = 1910 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1910 Atlantic hurricane season was the period during the summer and fall of 1910 in which tropical cyclones formed in the North Atlantic Ocean . The season was fairly inactive , with only five storms ; however , three grew into hurricanes and one became a major hurricane . The season got off to a late start with the formation of a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea on August 23 . September saw two storms , and the final tropical cyclone — Hurricane Five — existed during October . All but one of the storms made landfall , and the only cyclone which remained at sea had some effects on the island of Bermuda . 
 The season 's first storm had limited reported impacts on land , and the subsequent system caused more severe damage in southern Texas and northern Mexico . Hurricane Three dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico before striking the same region as the previous cyclone . Hurricane Four bypassed Bermuda to the east , where some property damage was reported . Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season , buffeting western Cuba for an extended period of time as it slowly executed a counterclockwise loop . Death tolls from the hurricane are estimated in the hundreds . 
 In addition to the five official tropical cyclones , a disturbance in the middle of September that tracked from east of the Lesser Antilles to off the coast of Canada was studied for potential classification . Despite producing gale @-@ force winds , the system was likely extratropical in nature , and any time it may have spent as a tropical storm was brief .

 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm One = = = 
 The first tropical cyclone of the season developed on August 23 , in the eastern Caribbean Sea . Not believed to have strengthened further , the storm tracked west @-@ northwestward and struck southwestern Hispaniola . It quickly weakened to a tropical depression as it turned more toward the northwest and crossed northern Cuba . On August 26 , the depression passed through the Bahamas , east of the Florida Peninsula . Heading due north , the storm had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by the next day . An area of high pressure to the north and east of the storm was said to have prevented it from recurving out to sea , and the cyclone skirted the eastern coast of North Carolina before being listed as dissipated east of the Delmarva Peninsula . The storm reportedly caused heavy precipitation on August 29 and 30 in Georgia and the Carolinas , while ships at sea reported high winds , rough seas and heavy rainfall . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Two = = = 
 On August 26 , a tropical depression formed in the central Gulf of Mexico . It drifted westward for several days , and by August 30 it intensified into a tropical storm while turning more southwestward . The storm peaked in intensity as a weak tropical storm shortly thereafter . On August 31 the storm moved inland near the mouth of the Rio Grande , and weakened as it swept inland . Advisories were issued for coastal areas before which strong winds and high tides affected the Texas coast . The cyclone inflicted some property damage in the Brownsville area . Winds unroofed houses at Port Isabel and destroyed some Mexican huts . The storm also blew fishing craft aground . No initial reports of fatalities were received , but two towns were left cut off from communication with Brownsville . 
 = = = San Zacarias Hurricane = = = 
 A tropical storm developed east of the Leeward Islands on September 5 and quickly became the season 's first hurricane . It continued westward through the islands and is estimated to have attained winds corresponding to Category 2 status on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . On the night of September 6 , San Zacarias Hurricane passed south of Puerto Rico ; winds blew up to 72 mph ( 116 km / h ) at San Juan . The hurricane weakened somewhat on September 7 as it skirted the southern coast of Hispaniola , and curving northwestward , it passed along northern Jamaica . On September 10 , it moved through the Yucatán Channel , restrengthening upon emerging into the Gulf of Mexico . Now on a northwesterly course , the storm reached its peak windspeeds on September 12 . Two days later , it made landfall along the Texas coast . 
 The storm dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico , amounting to 13 in ( 330 mm ) in a period of 12 hours at one location . Rivers swelled to " unprecedented " levels , and the hurricane resulted in " great havoc " to telephone and telegraph wires on the island . The United States Weather Bureau issued extensive warnings in association with the storm . High tides occurred along the coasts of Texas and Louisiana , accompanied by heavy rainfall . A large storm surge raised the water level at Corpus Christi to its highest in years and completely inundated Padre Island , where barometers recorded pressures as low as 28 @.@ 50 inHg ( 965 @.@ 12 mb ) on the southern half of the island . 
 = = = Hurricane Four = = = 
 In the Atlantic hurricane database , the fourth hurricane of the season is listed as having formed on September 24 , several hundred miles southeast of Bermuda . Strengthening , the storm moved northwestward and is estimated to have peaked with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . It gradually turned toward the northeast as it bypassed Bermuda to the east . On September 27 , it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and turned eastward . It dissipated several days later . The storm caused some damage to property on the island , and blew a barque aground . 
 = = = Hurricane Five = = = 
 The final storm of the season formed in the extreme southern Caribbean on October 9 , and steadily intensified as it moved northwestward . Shortly after making landfall on the western tip of Cuba , the storm peaked as a severe hurricane corresponding to Category 4 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale and completed a counterclockwise loop . During its loop , the pressure in its eye dropped to 924 mb ( 27 @.@ 29 inHg ) with an unofficial reading of 27 @.@ 10 inHg ( 917 @.@ 71 mb ) aboard the steamship Brazos . The cyclone began weakening and tracking toward the United States , and moved ashore near Fort Myers , Florida , with winds of 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) corresponding to those of a strong Category 2 hurricane . After moving through the state , it hugged the coast of the Southeastern United States on its way out to sea . Due to the storm 's tight and poorly documented loop , initial reports suggested that it was actually two separate cyclones that developed and affected land in rapid succession . Its track was subject to much debate at the time , and eventually it was identified as a single storm . Additionally , observations on the event resulted in a greater understanding of other weather features that took similar paths . 
 In Cuba , the storm was considered one of the most severe natural disasters in the island 's history . Damage was extensive , and thousands of peasants were reportedly left homeless . Throughout Florida , the storm also had widespread , yet more moderate , impacts , including damage to houses and the flooding of low @-@ lying land . The pressure at Fort Myers dropped to 28 @.@ 20 inHg ( 954 @.@ 96 mb ) during the storm . Although total monetary damage from the storm is unknown , estimates of losses in Havana , Cuba , exceed $ 1 million and in the Florida Keys , $ 250 @,@ 000 ( 1910 USD ) . At least 100 deaths occurred in Cuba alone . 
 = Beaumaris Castle = 
 Beaumaris Castle , located in the town of the same name on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales , was built as part of Edward I 's campaign to conquer the north of Wales after 1282 . Plans were probably first made to construct the castle in 1284 , but this was delayed due to lack of funds and work only began in 1295 following the Madog ap Llywelyn uprising . A substantial workforce was employed in the initial years under the direction of James of St George . Edward 's invasion of Scotland soon diverted funding from the project , however , and work stopped , only recommencing after an invasion scare in 1306 . When work finally ceased around 1330 a total of £ 15 @,@ 000 had been spent , a huge sum for the period , but the castle remained incomplete . 
 Beaumaris Castle was taken by Welsh forces in 1403 during the Owain Glyndŵr rebellion , but recaptured by royal forces in 1405 . Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 , the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I , holding out until 1646 when it surrendered to the Parliamentary armies . Despite forming part of a local royalist rebellion in 1648 the castle escaped slighting and was garrisoned by Parliament , but fell into ruin around 1660 , eventually forming part of a local stately home and park in the 19th century . In the 21st century the ruined castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist attraction . 
 Historian Arnold Taylor described Beaumaris Castle as Britain 's " most perfect example of symmetrical concentric planning " . The fortification is built of local stone , with a moated outer ward guarded by twelve towers and two gatehouses , overlooked by an inner ward with two large , D @-@ shaped gatehouses and six massive towers . The inner ward was designed to contain ranges of domestic buildings and accommodation able to support two major households . The south gate could be reached by ship , allowing the castle to be directly supplied by sea . UNESCO considers Beaumaris to be one of " the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe " , and it is classed as a World Heritage site .

 The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied for control of North Wales since the 1070s and the conflict had been renewed during the 13th century , leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales for the second time during his reign in 1282 . Edward invaded with a huge army , pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester . Edward decided to permanently colonise North Wales and provisions for its governance were set out in the Statute of Rhuddlan , enacted on 3 March 1284 . Wales was divided into counties and shires , emulating how England was governed , with three new shires created in the north @-@ west , Caernarfon , Merioneth and Anglesey . New towns with protective castles were established at Caernarfon and Harlech , the administrative centres of the first two shires , with another castle and walled town built in nearby Conwy , and plans were probably made to establish a similar castle and settlement near the town of Llanfaes on Anglesey . Llanfaes was the wealthiest borough in Wales and largest in terms of population , an important trading port and on the preferred route from North Wales to Ireland . The huge cost of the building the other castles , however , meant that the Llanfaes project had to be postponed . 
 In 1294 Madog ap Llywelyn rebelled against English rule . The revolt was bloody and amongst the casualties was Roger de <unk> , the sheriff of Anglesey . Edward suppressed the rebellion over the winter and once Anglesey was reoccupied in April 1295 he immediately began to progress the delayed plans to fortify the area . The chosen site was called Beaumaris , meaning " fair marsh " , whose name derives from the Norman @-@ French Beau <unk> , and in Latin the castle was termed de Bello Marisco . This was about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from Llanfaes and the decision was therefore taken to move the Welsh population of Llanfaes some 12 miles ( 19 km ) south @-@ west , where a settlement by the name of Newborough was created for them . The deportation of the local Welsh opened the way for the construction of a prosperous English town , protected by a substantial castle . 
 The castle was positioned in one corner of the town , following a similar town plan to that in the town of Conwy , although in Beaumaris no town walls were constructed at first , despite some foundations being laid . Work began in the summer of 1295 , overseen by Master James of St George . James had been appointed the " master of the king 's works in Wales " , reflecting the responsibility he had in their construction and design . From 1295 onwards , Beaumaris became his primary responsibility and more frequently he was given the title " magister <unk> de Bello Marisco " . The work was recorded in considerable detail on the pipe rolls , the continuous records of medieval royal expenditure , and , as a result , the early stages of construction at Beaumaris are relatively well understood for the period . 
 A huge amount of work was undertaken in the first summer , with an average of 1 @,@ 800 workmen , 450 stonemasons and 375 quarriers on the site . This consumed around £ 270 a week in wages and the project rapidly fell into arrears , forcing officials to issue leather tokens instead of paying the workforce with normal coinage . The centre of the castle was filled with temporary huts to house the workforce over the winter . The following spring , James explained to his employers some of the difficulties and the high costs involved : 
 In case you should wonder where so much money could go in a week , we would have you know that we have needed – and shall continue to need 400 masons , both cutters and layers , together with 2 @,@ 000 less skilled workmen , 100 carts , 60 wagons and 30 boats bringing stone and sea coal ; 200 quarrymen ; 30 smiths ; and carpenters for putting in the joists and floor boards and other necessary jobs . All this takes no account of the garrison ... nor of purchases of material . Of which there will have to be a great quantity ... The men 's pay has been and still is very much in arrears , and we are having the greatest difficulty in keeping them because they have simply nothing to live on . 
 The construction slowed during 1296 , although debts continued to build up , and work dropped off further the following year , stopping entirely by 1300 , by when around £ 11 @,@ 000 had been spent . The halt was primarily the result of Edward 's new wars in Scotland , which had begun to consume his attention and financial resources , but it left the castle only partially complete : the inner walls and towers were only a fraction of their proper height and the north and north @-@ west sides lacked outer defences altogether . In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales , but the unfinished castle had already fallen into a poor state of repair . Work recommenced on completing the outer defences , first under James ' direction and then , after his death in 1309 , Master Nicolas de <unk> . This work finally halted in 1330 with the castle still not built to its intended height ; by the end of the project , £ 15 @,@ 000 had been spent , a colossal sum for the period . A royal survey in 1343 suggested that at least a further £ 684 would be needed to complete the castle , but this was never invested .

 In 1400 a revolt broke out in North Wales against English rule , led by Owain Glyndŵr . Beaumaris Castle was placed under siege and captured by the rebels in 1403 , being retaken by royal forces in 1405 . The castle was ill @-@ maintained and fell into disrepair and by 1534 , when Roland de <unk> was the castle constable , rain was leaking into most of the rooms . In 1539 a report complained that it was protected by an arsenal of only eight or ten small guns and forty bows , which the castle 's new constable , Richard Bulkeley , considered to be completely inadequate for protecting the fortress against a potential Scottish attack . Matters worsened and by 1609 the castle was classed as " <unk> decayed " . 
 The English Civil War broke out in 1642 between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament . Beaumaris Castle was a strategic location in the war , as it controlled part of the route between the king 's bases in Ireland and his operations in England . Thomas Bulkeley , whose family had been involved in the management of the castle for several centuries , held Beaumaris for the king and may have spent around £ 3 @,@ 000 improving its defences . By 1646 , however , Parliament had defeated the royal armies and the castle was surrendered by Colonel Richard Bulkeley in June . Anglesey revolted against Parliament again in 1648 , and Beaumaris was briefly reoccupied by royalist forces , surrendering for a second time in October that year . 
 After the war many castles were slighted , damaged to put them beyond military use , but Parliament was concerned about the threat of a royalist invasion from Scotland and Beaumaris was spared . Colonel John Jones became the castle governor and a garrison was installed inside , at a cost of £ 1 @,@ 703 a year . When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 and restored the Bulkeley family as castle constables , Beaumaris appears to have been stripped of its valuable lead and remaining resources , including the roofs . 
 Lord Thomas Bulkeley bought the castle from the Crown in 1807 for £ 735 , incorporating it into the park that surrounded his local residence , Baron Hill . By then the castles of North Wales had become attractive locations for visiting painters and travellers , who considered the ivy @-@ clad ruins romantic . Although not as popular as other sites in the region , Beaumaris formed part of this trend and was visited by the future Queen Victoria in 1832 for an Eisteddfod festival and it was painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1835 . Some of the castle 's stones may have been reused in 1829 to build the nearby Beaumaris Gaol . 
 In 1925 Richard Williams @-@ Bulkeley gave Beaumaris to the Commissioners of Works , who then carried out a large scale restoration programme , stripping back the vegetation , digging out the moat and repairing the stonework . In 1950 the castle , considered by the authorities to be " one of the outstanding Edwardian medieval castles of Wales " , was designated as a Grade I listed building – the highest grade of listing , protecting buildings of " exceptional , usually national , interest " . 
 Beaumaris was declared part of the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd World Heritage site in 1986 , UNESCO considering it one of " the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe " . In the 21st century Beaumaris Castle is managed by Cadw , the Welsh Assembly Government 's agency for historic monuments , as a tourist attraction , with 75 @,@ 000 visitors during the 2007 – 08 financial year . The castle requires ongoing maintenance and repairs cost £ 58 @,@ 000 over the 2002 – 03 financial year . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Beaumaris Castle was never fully built , but had it been completed it would probably have closely resembled Harlech Castle . Both castles are concentric in plan , with walls within walls , although Beaumaris is the more regular in design . Historian Arnold Taylor described Beaumaris as Britain 's " most perfect example of symmetrical concentric planning " and for many years the castle was regarded as the pinnacle of military engineering during Edward I 's reign . This evolutionary interpretation is now disputed by historians : Beaumaris was as much a royal palace and symbol of English power as it was a straightforward defensive fortification . Nonetheless , the castle is praised by UNESCO as a " unique artistic achievement " for the way in which is combines " characteristic 13th century double @-@ wall structures with a central plan " and for the beauty of its " proportions and masonry " . 
 Beaumaris Castle was built at around sea @-@ level on top of the till and other sediments that form the local coastline , and was constructed from local Anglesey stone from within 10 miles ( 16 km ) of the site , with some stones brought along the coast by ship , for example from the limestone quarries at Penmon . The stone was a mixture of limestone , sandstone and green schists , which was used fairly randomly within the walls and towers ; the use of schists ceased after the pause in the building work in 1298 and as a result is limited to the lower levels of the walls . 
 The castle design formed an inner and an outer ward , surrounded in turn by a moat , now partially filled . The main entrance to the castle was the Gate next the Sea , next to the castle 's tidal dock that allowed it to be supplied directly by sea . The dock was protected by a wall later named the Gunners Walk and a firing platform that may have housed a trebuchet siege engine during the medieval period . The Gate next the Sea led into an outer barbican , protected by a drawbridge , arrow slits and murder @-@ holes , leading on into the outer ward . 
 The outer ward consisted of an eight @-@ sided curtain wall with twelve turrets enclosing an area approximately 60 feet ( 18 m ) across ; one gateway led out to the Gate next the Sea , the other , the Llanfaes Gate , led out to the north side of the castle . The defences were originally equipped with around 300 firing positions for archers , including 164 arrow slits , although 64 of the slits close to the ground level have since been blocked in to prevent them being exploited by attackers , either in the early 15th century or during the Civil War . 
 The walls of the inner ward were more substantial than those of the outer ward , 36 @-@ foot ( 11 m ) high and 15 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 7 m ) thick , with huge towers and two large gatehouses , enclosing a 0 @.@ 75 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 30 ha ) area . The inner ward was intended to hold the accommodation and other domestic buildings of the castle , with ranges of buildings stretching along the west and east sides of the ward ; some of the remains of the fireplaces for these buildings can still be seen in the stonework . It is uncertain if these ranges were actually ever built or if they were constructed but later demolished after the Civil War . If finished , the castle would have been able to host two substantial households and their followers , for example the king and queen , or the king , queen and a prince and his own wife . 
 The D @-@ shaped north gatehouse in the inner ward was intended to be two storeys high , with two sets of five , large windows , of which only one floor was actually completed . It would have included a large hall on the first floor , around 70 feet ( 21 m ) by 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) across , divided into two with separate fireplaces for heating . The south gatehouse was designed to be a replica of that on the north side , but building work progressed even less far before finishing in 1330 . Some of the stonework may since have been removed from the gatehouse , reducing its height even further . 
 The walls of the inner ward contain extensive first floor passageways , similar to those at Caernarfon Castle . These were intended to allow members of the castle to move between the towers , accessing the guardrooms , sleeping chambers and the castle latrines . The latrines were designed to be drained by a special system using the water from the moat , but the system does not appear to have worked well in practice . The six towers were intended to be three storeys high and contained fireplaces . The castle chapel was built into one of the towers and would have been used by the king and his family , rather than the wider garrison . 
 = Robert Catesby = 
 Robert Catesby ( b. in or after 1572 – 8 November 1605 ) was the leader of a group of provincial English Catholics who planned the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605 . 
 Most probably born in Warwickshire , Catesby was educated in nearby Oxford . His family were prominent recusant Catholics , therefore presumably to avoid swearing the Oath of Supremacy he left college before taking his degree . He married a Protestant in 1593 and fathered two children , one of whom survived and was baptised in a Protestant church , but in 1598 , following the deaths of his father and wife , he may have reverted to Catholicism . In 1601 he took part in the Essex Rebellion but was captured and fined , after which he sold his estate at Chastleton . 
 The Protestant James I , who became King of England in 1603 , was less tolerant of Catholicism than its followers had hoped . Catesby therefore planned to kill him by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder , the prelude to a popular revolt during which a Catholic monarch would be restored to the English throne . Early in 1604 he began to recruit other Catholics to his cause , including Thomas Wintour , John Wright , Thomas Percy , and Guy Fawkes . Described latterly as a charismatic and influential man , as well as a religious zealot , over the following months he helped bring a further eight conspirators into the plot , whose <unk> was planned for 5 November 1605 . A letter sent anonymously to William Parker , 4th Baron Monteagle , alerted the authorities , and on the eve of the planned explosion , during a search of Parliament , Fawkes was found guarding the barrels of gunpowder . News of his arrest caused the other plotters to flee London , warning Catesby along their way . 
 With a much @-@ diminished group of followers , Catesby made a stand at Holbeche House in Staffordshire , against a 200 @-@ strong company of armed men . He was shot and later found dead , clutching a picture of the Virgin Mary . As a warning to others , his body was exhumed and his head exhibited outside Parliament .

 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Robert Catesby was the third and only surviving son of Sir William and Anne ( née Throckmorton ) Catesby , and was probably born in or after 1572 at his father 's main residence in Lapworth . Robert was a lineal descendant of Sir William Catesby ( 1450 – 1485 ) , the influential councillor of Richard III captured at the Battle of Bosworth and executed . On his mother 's side he was descended from Sir Robert Throckmorton of Coughton , and his second wife , Elizabeth Hussey . His parents were prominent recusant Catholics ; his father had suffered years of imprisonment for his faith , and in 1581 had been tried in Star Chamber alongside William Vaux , 3rd Baron Vaux of Harrowden , and his brother @-@ in @-@ law Sir Thomas Tresham , for harbouring the Jesuit Edmund Campion . The head of the Throckmortons , Sir Thomas Throckmorton , was also fined for his recusancy , and spent years in prison . Another relation , Sir Francis Throckmorton , had been executed in 1584 for his involvement in a plot to free Mary , Queen of Scots . 
 In 1586 Robert was educated at Gloucester Hall in Oxford , a college noted for its Catholic intake . Those either studying at university or wishing to take public office could not do so without first swearing the Oath of Supremacy , an act which would have compromised Catesby 's Catholic faith . Presumably to avoid this consequence , he left without taking his degree , and may then have attended the seminary college of Douai . 
 = = = Adulthood = = = 
 In 1593 he married Catherine Leigh , daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh of Stoneleigh in Warwickshire . Catherine came from a wealthy Protestant family and brought with her a dowry of £ 2 @,@ 000 , but also a religious association that offered Robert some respite from the recusancy laws then in effect . From the death of his grandmother the following year he inherited a property at Chastleton , in Oxfordshire . The couple 's first son William died in infancy , but their second son Robert survived , and was baptised at Chastleton 's Protestant church on 11 November 1595 . When Catesby 's father died in 1598 , his estates at Ashby St Ledgers were left to his wife , while Catesby and his family remained at Chastleton . Catesby had seemed happy to remain a Church Papist but after his wife 's death later that year he became radicalised , and reverted to a more fanatical Catholicism . 
 In 1601 Catesby was involved in the Essex Rebellion . The Earl of Essex 's purpose might have lain in furthering his own interests rather than those of the Catholic Church , but Catesby hoped that if Essex succeeded , there might once more be a Catholic monarch . The rebellion was a failure however , and the wounded Catesby was captured , imprisoned at the Wood Street Counter , and fined 4 @,@ 000 marks ( equivalent to over £ 6 million as of 2008 ) by Elizabeth I. Sir Thomas Tresham helped pay some of Catesby 's fine , following which Catesby sold his estate at Chastleton . Several authors speculate about Catesby 's movements as Elizabeth 's health grew worse ; he was probably among those " principal papists " imprisoned by a government fearing open rebellion , and in March 1603 he may have sent Christopher Wright to Spain to see if Philip III would continue to support English Catholics after Elizabeth 's death . Catesby funded the activities of some Jesuit priests , and while visiting them made occasional use of the alias Mr Roberts . 
 = = Gunpowder Plot = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Catholics had hoped that the persecution they suffered during Elizabeth 's reign would end when she was succeeded in 1603 by James I. His mother , Mary , Queen of Scots ( executed in 1587 for treason ) had been a devout Catholic , and James 's attitude appeared moderate , even tolerant towards Catholics . Protestant rulers across Europe had , however , been the target of several assassination attempts during the late 16th century , and until the 1620s some English Catholics believed that regicide was justifiable to remove tyrants from power . Much of James 's political writing was concerned with such matters , and the " refutation of the [ Catholic ] argument that ' faith did not need to be kept with heretics ' " . Shortly after he discovered that his wife had been sent a rosary from the pope , James exiled all Jesuits and other Catholic priests , and reimposed the collection of fines for recusancy . Catesby soon began to lose patience with the new dynasty . 
 British author and historian Antonia Fraser describes Catesby 's mentality as " that of the crusader who does not hesitate to employ the sword in the cause of values which he considers are spiritual " . Writing after the events of 1604 – 1606 , the Jesuit priest Father Tesimond 's description of his friend was favourable : " his countenance was exceedingly noble and expressive ... his conversation and manners were peculiarly attractive and imposing , and that by the dignity of his character he exercised an irresistible influence over the minds of those who associated with him . " Fellow conspirator Ambrose Rookwood , shortly before his own death , said that he " loved and respected him [ Catesby ] as his own life " , while Catesby 's friend , Father John Gerard , claimed he was " respected in all companies of such as are counted there swordsmen or men of action " , and that " few were in the opinions of most men preferred before him and he increased much his acquaintance and friends . " Author Mark Nicholls suggests that " bitterness at the failure of Essex 's design nevertheless seems to have sharpened an already well @-@ honed neurosis . " 
 = = = Early stages = = = 
 Despite the ease with which Catesby seems to have inspired his fellow conspirators , that it was he and not Fawkes ( today most often associated with 5 November ) who devised what became known as the Gunpowder Plot , has largely been forgotten . The precise date on which he set events in motion is unknown , but it is likely that he first had the idea early in 1604 . Sometime around June the previous year he was visited by his friend Thomas Percy . A great @-@ grandson of the 4th Earl of Northumberland , Percy was reported to have had a " wild youth " before he became a Catholic , and during Elizabeth 's final years had been entrusted by the 9th Earl with a secret mission to James 's court in Scotland , to plead with the king on behalf of England 's Catholics . He now complained bitterly about what he considered to be James 's treachery , and threatened to kill him . Catesby replied " No , no , Tom , thou shalt not venture to small purpose , but if thou wilt be a traitor thou shalt be to some great advantage . " Percy listened while Catesby added " I am thinking of a most sure way and I will soon let thee know what it is . " During <unk> on 31 October he sent for his cousin Thomas Wintour , who was at Huddington Court in Worcestershire with his brother Robert . Thomas was educated as a lawyer and had fought for England in the Low Countries , but in 1600 had converted to Catholicism . Following the Earl of Essex 's failed rebellion , he had travelled to Spain to raise support for English Catholics , a mission which the authorities would later describe as comprising part of a ' Spanish Treason ' . Although Thomas declined his invitation , Catesby again invited him in February the next year . 
 When Wintour responded to the summons he found his cousin with the swordsman John Wright . Catesby told him of his plan to kill the king and his government by blowing up " the Parliament howse with Gunpowder ... in that place have they done us all the <unk> , and perchance God hath designed that place for their punishment " . Wintour at first objected to his cousin 's scheme , but Catesby , who said that " the nature of the disease required so sharp a remedy " , won him over . Despite Catholic Spain 's moves toward diplomacy with England , Catesby still harboured hopes of foreign support and a peaceful solution . Wintour therefore returned to the continent , where he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the affable Constable of Castile to press for good terms for English Catholics in forthcoming peace negotiations . He then turned to Sir William Stanley , an English Catholic and veteran commander who had switched sides from England to Spain , and the exiled Welsh spy Hugh Owen ; both cast doubt on the plotters ' chances of receiving Spanish support . Owen did , however , introduce Wintour to Guy Fawkes , whose name Catesby had already supplied as " a confidant gentleman " who might enter their ranks . Fawkes was a devout English Catholic who had travelled to the continent to fight for Spain in the Dutch War of Independence . Wintour told him of their plan to " doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spaine healped us nott " , and thus in April 1604 the two men returned home . Wintour told Catesby that despite positive noises from the Spanish , he feared that " the deeds would nott answere " . This was a response that in Nicholls 's opinion came as no surprise to Catesby , who wanted and expected nothing less . 
 On Sunday 20 May in the well @-@ to @-@ do Strand district of London , Catesby met with Thomas Wintour , John Wright , Thomas Percy and Guy Fawkes , at an inn called the Duck and Drake . Percy had been introduced to the plot several weeks after Wintour and Fawkes 's return to England . Alone in a private room , all swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book , and then in another room celebrated Mass with the Jesuit priest ( and friend to Catesby ) John Gerard . Robert Keyes was admitted to the group in October 1604 , and charged with looking after Catesby 's Lambeth house , where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored . Two months later Catesby recruited his servant , Thomas Bates , into the plot , after the latter accidentally became aware of it , and by March 1605 three more were admitted : Thomas Wintour 's brother Robert , John Grant and John Wright 's brother Christopher . 
 = = = Further recruitment = = = 
 Although the state opening of Parliament was planned for February 1605 , concern over the plague meant that it would instead occur on 3 October . A contemporaneous government account has the plotters engaged in digging a tunnel beneath Parliament by December 1604 , but no other evidence exists to prove this , and no trace of a tunnel has since been found . If the story is true , the plotters ceased their efforts when the tenancy to the undercroft beneath the House of Lords became available . Several months later , early in June 1605 , Catesby met the principal Jesuit in England , Father Henry Garnet , on Thames Street in London . While discussing the war in Flanders , Catesby asked about the morality of " killing innocents " . Garnet said that such actions could often be excused , but according to his own account during a second meeting in July he showed Catesby a letter from the pope which forbade rebellion . Catesby replied , " Whatever I mean to do , if the Pope knew , he would not hinder for the general good of our country . " Father Garnet 's protestations prompted Catesby 's next reply , " I am not bound to take knowledge by you of the Pope 's will . " Soon after , the Jesuit priest Father Tesimond told Father Garnet that while taking Catesby 's confession he had learned of the plot . Father Garnet met with Catesby a third time on 24 July at White Webbs in Enfield Chase , the home of Catesby 's wealthy relative Anne Vaux , and a house long suspected by the government of harbouring Jesuit priests . Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot , the priest tried in vain to dissuade Catesby from his course . 
 By 20 July 1605 , 36 barrels of gunpowder had been stored in the undercroft , but the ever @-@ present threat of the plague yet again prorogued the opening of Parliament , this time until 5 November 1605 . Catesby had borne much of the scheme 's financial cost thus far , and was running out of money . As their plans moved closer to fruition , during a secret meeting at Bath in August , at which he , Percy and Thomas Wintour were present , the plotters decided that " the company being yet but few " he was to be allowed to " call in whom he thought best " . Catesby soon added Ambrose Rookwood , a staunch Catholic who was both young and wealthy , but who most importantly owned a stable of fine horses at Coldham . For the plan to work Rookwood and his horses needed to be close to the other conspirators , and so Catesby persuaded him to rent Clopton House at Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon . Francis Tresham was brought into the plot on 14 October . Also descended from William Catesby , Tresham was Robert 's cousin , and as young children the two had often visited White Webbs . Although his account of the meeting is weighted with hindsight ( when captured he sought to distance himself from the affair ) , he asked Catesby what support for the Catholics would be forthcoming once the king had been killed . Catesby 's answer , " The necessity of the Catholics [ was such that ] it must needs be done " , in Fraser 's opinion demonstrates his unwavering view on the matter , held at least since his first meeting with Thomas Wintour early in 1604 . The final conspirator to be brought in was Everard Digby , on 21 October , at Harrowden . Catesby confided in Digby during a delayed Feast of Saint Luke . Like Rookwood , Digby was young , wealthy , and possessed a stable of horses . Catesby told him to rent Coughton Court near Alcester , so that he would " the better to be able to do good to the cause [ kidnap Princess Elizabeth ] " . 
 The day after Tresham 's recruitment , Catesby exchanged greetings in London with Fawkes 's former employer , Lord Montague , and asked him " The Parliament , I think , brings your lordship up now ? " Montague told him that he was visiting a relative , and that he would be at Parliament in a few weeks time . Catesby replied " I think your Lordship takes no pleasure to be there " . Montague , who had already been imprisoned for speaking out in the House of Lords against anti @-@ Papist legislation , and who had no inclination to be present while more laws were introduced , agreed . Following the plot 's failure he became a suspect and was arrested , but after intense lobbying was released some months later . 
 The recruitment of Rookwood , Tresham and Digby coincided with a series of meetings in various taverns across London , during which the last remaining details were worked out . Fawkes would light the fuse , and escape by boat across the Thames . An uprising would start in the Midlands , during which Princess Elizabeth was to be captured . Fawkes would escape to the continent and explain to the Catholic powers what had happened in England . 
 = = = Monteagle letter = = = 
 Several of the conspirators expressed worries about fellow Catholics who would be caught up in the planned explosion ; Percy was concerned for his patron , Northumberland , and when the young Earl of Arundel 's name was mentioned Catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from the chamber on that day . Keyes 's suggestion to warn the Earl of Peterborough was , however , derided . On 26 October William Parker , 4th Baron Monteagle ( Tresham 's brother @-@ in @-@ law ) received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton , warning him not to attend Parliament , and forecasting that " they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament ; and yet they shall not see who hurts them " . Uncertain of its meaning he delivered it to Secretary of State Robert Cecil , 1st Earl of Salisbury . In an extraordinary act of bravado Catesby had planned to go hunting with James , but was warned of the betrayal by Monteagle 's servant . He immediately suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter , a view which was shared by Thomas Wintour . Together the two confronted the recently recruited conspirator , and threatened to " hang him " , but Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter , and the next day urged them to abandon the plot . 
 Catesby waited for Percy 's return from the north , before making his decision . He thought the letter too vague to constitute any meaningful threat to the plan , and decided to forge ahead . As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder , other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands . Salisbury , already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter , did not yet know the exact nature of the plot or who exactly was involved . He elected to wait , to see how events unfolded . On 3 November , Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London . Although the nature of their discussion is unknown , Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred , as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York 's lodgings , enquiring as to the movements of the king 's daughter . Nicholls mentions that a week earlier — on the same day that Monteagle received his letter — Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes , to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth . 
 = = = Failure and death = = = 
 Late on Monday 4 November , Catesby , John Wright and Bates left for the Midlands , ready for the planned uprising . That night however , Fawkes was discovered guarding the gunpowder in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords . As news of his arrest spread , the next day most of the conspirators still in London fled . Catesby 's party , ignorant of what was happening in London , paused at Dunstable when his horse lost a shoe . When Rookwood caught them up and broke to them the news of Fawkes 's arrest , the group , which now included Rookwood , Catesby , Bates , the Wright brothers and Percy , rode toward Dunchurch . At about 6 : 00 pm that evening they reached Catesby 's family home at Ashby St Ledgers , where his mother and Robert Wintour were staying . To keep his mother ignorant of their situation , Catesby sent a message asking Wintour to meet him at the edge of the town . The group continued on to Dunchurch , where they met Digby and his hunting party and informed them that the king and Salisbury were dead , thus persuading them to continue with the plan . 
 On 6 November they raided Warwick Castle for supplies , before continuing to Norbrook to collect stored weapons . From there they continued their journey to Huddington . Catesby gave Bates a letter to deliver to Father Garnet and the other priests at Coughton Court , informing them of what had transpired , and asking for their help in raising an army in Wales , where Catholic support was believed to be strong . The priest begged Catesby and his followers to stop their " wicked actions " , and to listen to the pope 's preachings . Father Garnet fled , and managed to evade capture for several weeks . Catesby and the others arrived at Huddington at about 2 : 00 pm , and were met by Thomas Wintour . Terrified of being associated with the fugitives , family members and former friends showed them no sympathy . 
 Back in London , under pain of torture Fawkes had started to reveal what he knew , and on 7 November the government named Catesby as a wanted man . Early that morning , at Huddington the remaining outlaws went to confession , before taking the sacrament — in Fraser 's opinion , a sign that none of them thought they had long to live . The party of fugitives , which included those at the centre of the plot , their supporters and Digby 's hunting party , by now had dwindled to only thirty @-@ six in number . They continued on through pouring rain to Hewell Grange , home of the young Lord Windsor . He was absent however , so they helped themselves to further arms , ammunition , and money . The locals were unsupportive ; on hearing that Catesby 's party stood for " God and Country " , they replied that they were for " King James as well as God and Country " . The party reached Holbeche House , on the border of Staffordshire , at about 10 : 00 pm . Tired and desperate , they spread in front of the fire some of the now @-@ soaked gunpowder taken from Hewell Grange , to dry out . Although gunpowder does not explode ( unless physically contained ) , a spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby , Rookwood , Grant , and another man . 
 Catesby survived , albeit scorched . Digby left , ostensibly to give himself up , as did John Wintour . Thomas Bates fled , along with Robert Wintour . Remaining were Catesby ( described as " reasonably well " ) , Rookwood , the Wright brothers , Percy and John Grant , who had been so badly injured that his eyes were " burnt out " . They resolved to stay in the house and wait for the arrival of the king 's men . Catesby , believing his death to be near , kissed the gold crucifix he wore around his neck and said he had given everything for " the honour of the Cross " . He refused to be taken prisoner , " against that only he would defend himself with his sword " . 
 Richard Walsh , Sheriff of Worcester , and his company of 200 men besieged Holbeche House at about 11 : 00 am on 8 November . While crossing the courtyard Thomas Wintour was hit in the shoulder . John Wright was shot , followed by his brother , and then Rookwood . Catesby and Percy were reportedly both dropped by a single lucky shot , while standing near the door . Catesby managed to crawl inside the house , where his body was later found , clutching a picture of the Virgin Mary . This and his gold crucifix were sent to London , to demonstrate what " superstitious and Popish idols " had inspired the plotters . The survivors were taken into custody and the dead buried near Holbeche . On the orders of the Earl of Northampton however , the bodies of Catesby and Percy were exhumed and decapitated . John Harington , 2nd Baron Harington of Exton , made an opportune study of the heads while en route to London , and later reflected : " more terrible countenances were never looked upon " . Placed on " the side of the Parliament House " , Catesby 's head became one of the " sightless spectators of their own failure . " 
 = History of agriculture in Scotland = 
 The history of agriculture in Scotland includes all forms of farm production in the modern boundaries of Scotland , from the prehistoric era to the present day . Scotland has between a fifth and a sixth of the arable or good pastoral land of England and Wales , mostly in the south and east . Heavy rainfall , wind and salt spray made most of the western islands treeless . The terrain made internal communication and agriculture difficult . In the Neolithic period , from around 6 @,@ 000 years ago , there is evidence of permanent settlements and farming . The two main sources of food were grain and cow milk . From the Bronze Age , arable land spread at the expense of forest . From the Iron Age , there were hill forts in southern Scotland associated with cultivation ridges and terraces and the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture . During the period of Roman occupation of Britain there was re @-@ growth of trees indicating a reduction in agriculture . 
 The early Middle Ages were a period of climate deterioration , resulting in more land becoming unproductive . Self @-@ sufficient farms were based around a single homestead or a small cluster of homes . More oats and barley were grown than corn , and cattle were the most important domesticated animal . From c . 1150 to 1300 , warm dry summers and less severe winters allowed cultivation at greater heights and made land more productive . The system of infield and outfield agriculture may have been introduced with feudalism from the twelfth century . By the late Medieval period , most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile . These were settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams , organised in run rigs . Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter , pulled by oxen . The rural economy boomed in the thirteenth century and in the immediate aftermath of the Black Death was still buoyant , but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century . 
 As feudal distinctions declined in the early modern era , the major landholding orders , or heritors , were the lairds and yeomen . Others with property rights included husbandmen and free tenants . Many young people left home to become domestic and agricultural servants . The early modern era also saw the impact of the Little Ice Age , necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic . Under the Commonwealth , the country was relatively highly taxed , but gained access to English markets . After the Restoration customs duties with England were re @-@ established . Economic conditions were generally favourable , as landowners promoted better tillage and cattle @-@ raising . The closing decade of the seventeenth century saw a slump , followed the failed harvests of the " seven ill years " , but these shortages would be the last of their kind . After the Union of 1707 there was a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility . Enclosure displaced the run rig system and free pasture . The resulting Lowland Clearances saw hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland forcibly removed . The later Highland Clearances saw the displacement of much of the population of the Highlands as lands were enclosed for sheep farming . Those that remained many were now crofters , living on very small , rented farms with indefinite tenure , dependent on kelping , fishing , spinning of linen and military service . Scotland suffered its last major subsistence crisis when the potato blight reached the Highlands in 1846 . 
 In the twentieth century Scottish agriculture became susceptible to world markets . There were dramatic price rises in the First World War , but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s , followed by more rises in the Second World War . In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market . There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s , resulting in intensive farming and increasing mechanisation . The UK joined the European Economic Community in 1972 . Some sectors became viable only with subsidies . A series of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy from the 1990s attempted to control over @-@ production , limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage . A dual farm structure emerged with large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 Scotland is roughly half the size by area of England and Wales , but has approximately the same amount of coastline . It has only between a fifth and a sixth of the amount of the arable or good pastoral land ( under 60 metres ( 200 ft ) above sea level ) , most of which is located in the south and east . This made marginal pastoral farming and fishing the key factors in the pre @-@ modern economy . Its east Atlantic position causes very heavy rainfall : at the end of the twentieth century about 700 centimetres ( 280 in ) per year in the east and over 1 @,@ 000 centimetres ( 390 in ) in the west . This encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog , the acidity of which , combined with high levels of wind and salt spray , made most of the western islands treeless . The existence of hills , mountains , quicksands and marshes made agriculture and internal communication difficult . 
 = = Prehistory = = 
 At times during the last interglacial period ( 130 @,@ 000 – 70 @,@ 000 BCE ) Europe had a climate warmer than it is today , and early humans may have made their way to Scotland , though archaeologists have found no traces of this . Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain , and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable , around 9600 BCE . Mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherer encampments formed the first known settlements , and archaeologists have dated an encampment near Biggar to around 8500 BCE . Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat @-@ using people making tools from bone , stone and antlers . The oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth , dating from the Mesolithic period , about 8240 BCE . 
 In the Neolithic period , from around 6 @,@ 000 years ago , there is evidence of permanent settlements and farming . This includes the well @-@ preserved stone house at Knap of Howar on Papa Westray , dating from around 3500 BCE and the village of similar houses at Skara Brae on West Mainland , Orkney from about 500 years later . Evidence of prehistoric farming includes small plots of improved land , with simple stone boundaries . On Shetland these have been found under peat and on the mainland they are associated with <unk> ( piles of rocks that have been cleared from fields ) . Archaeological evidence of pollen , pottery , settlements and human remains indicates that the two main sources of food were grain and cow milk , in a pattern that probably remained constant until the High Middle Ages . There is also some limited evidence of the cultivation of flax from this period . 
 From the beginning of the Bronze Age , about 2000 BCE , extensive analyses of Black Loch in Fife indicate that arable land spread at the expense of forest . From the Iron Age , beginning in the seventh century BCE , as elsewhere in Europe , hill forts were first introduced . Some of these forts in southern Scotland are associated with cultivation ridges and terraces . Over 400 souterrains , small underground constructions , have been discovered in Scotland , many of them in the south @-@ east , and although few have been dated , those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE . They are usually found close to settlements ( whose timber frames are much less well @-@ preserved ) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products . Aerial photography reveals extensive prehistoric field systems that underlie existing boundaries in some Lowland areas , suggesting that the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture . During the period of Roman occupation of what is now northern England , and occasional advances into Southern Scotland , there was re @-@ growth of birch , oak and hazel for five centuries , suggesting that the Roman invasions had a negative impact on the native population and the extent of agriculture . 
 = = Middle Ages = = 
 The early Middle Ages were a period of climate deterioration , with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall , resulting in more land becoming unproductive . With a lack of significant transport links and wider markets , most farms had to produce a self @-@ sufficient diet of meat , dairy products and cereals , supplemented by hunter @-@ gathering . Limited archaeological evidence indicates that throughout Northern Britain farming was based around a single homestead or a small cluster of three or four homes , each probably containing a nuclear family , with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements , reflecting the partition of land through inheritance . The climate was more favourable for oats and barley than for corn . The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal , followed by pigs , sheep and goats , while domesticated fowl were very rare . 
 In the period c . 1150 to 1300 , the warm dry summers and less severe winters of the Medieval Warm Period allowed cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and made land more productive . Arable farming grew significantly , but was still more common in low @-@ lying areas than in high @-@ lying areas such as the Highlands , Galloway and the Southern Uplands . The feudalism introduced under David I , particularly in the east and south where the crown 's authority was greatest , saw the placement of lordships . Land was now held from the king , or a superior lord , in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military . Barons , who held feudal tenures , had the right to hold baronial courts , which could deal with matters of land ownership . However , the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing systems of landholding and tenure and it is not clear how this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers . In places , feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land . The predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system , based on the English model , impracticable in some areas . Obligations appear to have been limited to occasional labour service , seasonal renders of food , hospitality and money rents . 
 The system of infield and outfield agriculture , a variation of open field farming widely used across Europe , may have been introduced with feudalism and would continue until the eighteenth century . This expanded from the use of small enclosed fields , which continued from the prehistoric era . The infield was the best land , close to housing . It was farmed continuously and most intensively , receiving most of the manure . Crops were usually <unk> ( a form of barley ) , oats and sometimes wheat , rye and legumes . The more extensive outfield was used largely for oats . It was fertilised from the overnight folding of cattle in the summer and was often left fallow to recover its fertility . In fertile regions the infield could be extensive , but in the uplands it might be small , surrounded by large amounts of outfield . In coastal areas fertiliser included seaweed and around the major burghs urban refuse was used . Yields were fairly low , often around three times the quantity of seed sown , although they could reach twice that yield on some infields . The main unit of land measurement in Scotland was the davoch ( i.e. " vat " ) , called the arachor in Lennox . This unit is also known as the " Scottish ploughgate " . In English @-@ speaking Lothian , it was simply ploughgate . It may have measured about 104 acres ( 0 @.@ 42 km2 ) , divided into four raths . 
 By the late Medieval period , most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile , settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams , allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers , known as husbandmen . The average amount of land used by a husbandman in Scotland might have been 26 acres ( 0 @.@ 11 km2 ) . Below the husbandmen , lesser landholders and free tenants were the cottars , who often shared rights to common pasture , occupied small portions of land and participated in joint farming as hired labour . Farms also might have grassmen , who had rights only to grazing . 
 <unk> , of a furrow and ridge , usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land , helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions . Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter , pulled by oxen , which were more effective on heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses . Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord 's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord 's mill . Key crops included kale ( for both humans and animals ) , and hemp and flax for cloth production . Sheep and goats were probably the main sources of milk , while cattle were raised primarily for meat . The rural economy appears to have boomed in the thirteenth century and in the immediate aftermath of the Black Death , probably the bubonic plague , which reached Scotland in 1349 and killed perhaps over a third of the population , was still buoyant , but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes that can be seen in clerical benefices , of between a third and half compared with the beginning of the era , to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century . Towards the end of the period average temperatures began to reduce again , with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture , particularly in the Highlands . 
 = = Early modern era = = 
 While barons held increasingly nominal feudal tenures local tenants @-@ in @-@ chief , who held legally held their land directly from the king and who by the sixteenth century were often the major local landholders in an area , grew in significance . As feudal distinctions declined , the barons and tenants @-@ in @-@ chief merged to form a new identifiable group , the lairds , roughly equivalent to the English gentlemen . Below the lairds were a variety of groups , often ill @-@ defined . These included yeomen , later characterised by Walter Scott as " bonnet lairds " , often owning substantial land . The practice of <unk> ( by which a tenant paid an entry sum and an annual feu duty , but could pass the land on to their heirs ) meant that the number of people holding heritable possession of lands , which had previously been controlled by the church or nobility , expanded . These and the lairds probably numbered about 10 @,@ 000 by the seventeenth century and became what the government defined as heritors , on whom the financial and legal burdens of local government increasingly fell . Below the substantial landholders were those engaged in subsistence agriculture , who made up the majority of the working population . Those with property rights included husbandmen , lesser landholders and free tenants . By the early modern era in Lowland rural society , as in England , many young people , both male and female , left home to become domestic and agricultural servants . Women acted as an important part of the workforce . Many unmarried women worked away from their families as farm servants and married women worked with their husbands around the farm , taking part in all the major agricultural tasks . They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest , forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin . 
 The early modern era also saw the impact of the Little Ice Age , of colder and wetter weather , which peaked towards the end of the seventeenth century . Almost half the years in the second half of the sixteenth century saw local or national scarcity , necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic , referred to as Scotland 's " emergency granary " . This was particularly from Poland through the port of Danzig , but later Königsberg and Riga , shipping Russian grain , and Swedish ports , would become important . The trade was so important that Scottish colonies were established in these ports . In the early seventeenth century famine was relatively common , with four periods of famine prices between 1620 and 1625 . The English invasions of the 1640s had a profound impact on the Scottish economy , with the destruction of crops and the disruption of markets resulting in some of the most rapid price rises of the century . Under the Commonwealth , the country was relatively highly taxed , but gained access to English markets . After the Restoration the formal frontier with England was re @-@ established , along with its customs duties . Economic conditions were generally favourable from 1660 to 1688 , as land owners promoted better tillage and cattle @-@ raising . By the end of the century the drovers roads , stretching down from the Highlands through south @-@ west Scotland to north @-@ east England , had become firmly established as routes for Highland cattle to reach English markets . The closing decade of the seventeenth century saw the generally favourable economic conditions that had dominated since the Restoration come to an end . There was a slump in trade with the Baltic and France from 1689 to 1691 , caused by French protectionism and changes in the Scottish cattle trade , followed by four years of failed harvests ( 1695 , 1696 and 1698 – 99 ) , known as the " seven ill years " . The result was severe famine and depopulation , particularly in the north . The famines of the 1690s were seen as particularly severe , partly because famine had become relatively rare in the second half of the seventeenth century , with only one year of dearth ( in 1674 ) and the shortages of the 1690s would be the last of their kind . 
 = = Eighteenth century = = 
 Increasing contacts with England after the Union of 1707 led to a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility . The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723 , including in its 300 members dukes , earls , lairds and landlords . Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses , the sowing of rye grass and clover . Turnips and cabbages were introduced , lime was put down to combat soil acidity , marshes were drained , roads built and woods planted . Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced . The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry . Enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture , creating the landscape of largely rectangular fields that characterises the Lowlands today . New farm buildings , often based on designs in patterns books , replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms . Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse , with dwelling house , barn and byre in a row , but in larger farms a three- or four @-@ sided layout became common , separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters . 
 Early improvement was carried out with the traditional tools , but new technology was increasingly important . Lighter ploughs were adopted , including from 1763 James Small 's cast iron and curved mould board . It was first adopted in the south @-@ east and spread to rest of the country in the 1770s . From 1788 Andrew Meikle 's automated threshing mill speeded up a vital part of the harvesting process . There was increasing regional specialisation . The Lothians became a major centre of grain , Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep . 
 The result of these changes were the Lowland Clearances , by which hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years . Many small settlements were dismantled , their occupants forced either to the new purpose @-@ built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn of Ormiston to house the displaced cottars on the outskirts of the new ranch @-@ style farms , or to the new industrial centres of Glasgow , Edinburgh , or northern England . Tens of thousands of others emigrated to Canada or the United States , finding opportunities there to own and farm their own land . 
 = = Nineteenth century = = 
 Improvement continued in the nineteenth century . Innovations included the first working reaping machine , developed by Patrick Bell in 1828 . His rival James Smith turned to improving sub @-@ soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil . Previously unworkable low @-@ lying <unk> could now be brought into arable production and the result was the even Lowland landscape that still predominates . 
 While the Lowlands had seen widespread agricultural improvement , the Highlands remained very poor and traditional . A handful of powerful families , typified by the dukes of Argyll , Atholl , Buccleuch , and Sutherland , owned the best lands and controlled local political , legal and economic affairs . As late as 1878 , 68 families owned nearly half the land in Scotland . Particularly after the end of the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars ( 1790 – 1815 ) , these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society . They turned to money rents and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans . This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in mid @-@ century , when Britain adopted a free trade policy , and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production . 
 One result of these changes were the Highland Clearances , by which much of the population of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed , principally so that they could be used for sheep farming . The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the UK , but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing , the lack of legal protection for year @-@ by @-@ year tenants under Scots law , the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system , and the brutality of many evictions . The result was a continuous exodus from the land — to the cities , or further afield to England , Canada , America or Australia . Many that remained were now crofters , living on very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals . For these families kelping , fishing , spinning of linen and military service became important sources of additional revenue . Scotland suffered its last major subsistence crisis , when the potato blight that caused the Irish potato famine reached the Highlands in 1846 . Some 150 @,@ 000 people whose food supply was mainly potatoes faced disaster . They were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland , but the danger of starvation remained into the 1850s . 
 The unequal concentration of land ownership remained an emotional subject and was violently challenged in the 1880s through the Highland Land League . After the report of the Napier Commission of 1883 , the government stepped in , passing the Crofters ' Holdings ( Scotland ) Act , 1886 to reduce rents , guarantee fixity of tenure , and break up large estates to provide crofts for the homeless . Explicit security was given for the Scottish smallholders ; the legal right to bequeath tenancies to descendants and a Crofting Commission was created in 1886 . 
 = = Twentieth century to the present = = 
 In the twentieth century Scottish agriculture became susceptible to the ups and downs of world markets . There were dramatic price rises in the First World War , but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s , in which perhaps 40 per cent of Scottish land changed hands , followed by more price rises in the Second World War . In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market . A series of Acts of Parliament followed , designed to give price support and grants to farmers . After the Second World War and the associated rationing , there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production . This lasted until the late 1970s , resulting in more intensive farming . More areas of marginal land were brought into production with government subsidies . At the same time , the amount of forest was increased by a factor of three . There was increasing mechanisation of Scottish agriculture . The horse was replaced by the tractor and the combine harvester . This meant that farming became less labour @-@ intensive . In 1951 , 88 @,@ 000 people worked in Scottish agriculture full @-@ time , but by 1991 it had fallen to about 25 @,@ 000 , leading to more depopulation of rural areas . This helped make Scottish agriculture among the most efficient in Europe . 
 In the 1960s and 1970s , 76 – 77 per cent of output by value was livestock farming and , although this has fallen to about 64 per cent since 1990 , arable farming remains a minority of the sector and two @-@ thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture . One result is that <unk> and arable @-@ based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where farming is overwhelmingly arable . The UK membership of the European Economic Community ( later the European Union ) in 1972 began a re @-@ orientation for Scottish farming . A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations . Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) of the EU , which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers . As a result , some sectors , particularly hill sheep farming , became viable only with subsidies . Eight @-@ four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area ( LFA ) , but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers , mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands . A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over @-@ production , limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage . As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming , the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms , but most were insufficient to support a family , and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes . A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings . Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union , almost ten times the average . 
 = Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia = 
 Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia ( Olga Nikolaevna Romanova ) ( Russian : Великая Княжна <unk> Николаевна ; IPA : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ( Velikaya Knyazhna Ol <unk> Nikolaevna ) ; November 15 ( 16th starting in 1900 ) [ O.S. November 3 ] 1895 – July 17 , 1918 ) was the eldest daughter of the last Tsar of the Russian Empire , Emperor Nicholas II , and of Empress Alexandra of Russia . Because Russia continued to use the Julian calendar in 1900 and later , her birthday ended up being celebrated on November 16 new style starting in 1900 . 
 During her lifetime , Olga 's future marriage was the subject of great speculation within Russia . Matches were rumored with Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia , Crown Prince Carol of Romania , Edward , Prince of Wales , eldest son of Britain 's George V , and with Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia . Olga herself wanted to marry a Russian and remain in her home country . During World War I , Olga nursed wounded soldiers in a military hospital until her own nerves gave out and , thereafter , oversaw administrative duties at the hospital . 
 Olga 's murder following the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church . In later years , when dozens of people made claims to be surviving members of the imperial family , a woman named Marga Boodts claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga , but her claim was not taken seriously . Olga was assassinated along with her family at Yekaterinburg . Her remains were identified through DNA testing and were buried during a funeral ceremony in 1998 at Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg along with those of her parents and two of her sisters . 
 = = Early life and childhood = = 
 Olga 's siblings were Grand Duchesses Tatiana , Maria , Anastasia , and Tsarevich Alexei of Russia . Her Russian title ( Velikaya Knyazhna Великая Княжна ) is most precisely translated as " Grand Princess " , meaning that Olga , as an " imperial highness " , was higher in rank than other princesses in Europe who were " royal <unk> " . However , " Grand Duchess " is the usual English translation . Olga 's friends and family generally called her simply Olga Nikolaevna or nicknamed her " <unk> " , " <unk> " or " <unk> " . Among her godparents was her great @-@ grandmother , Queen Victoria . Olga was most often paired with her sister Tatiana . The two girls shared a room , dressed alike , and were known as " The Big Pair " . 
 From her earliest years she was known for her compassionate heart and desire to help others , but also for her temper , blunt honesty and moodiness . As a small child , she once lost patience while posing for a portrait painter and told the man , " You are a very ugly man and I don 't like you one bit ! " The Tsar 's children were raised as simply as possible , sleeping on hard camp cots unless they were ill , taking cold baths every morning . Servants called Olga and her siblings by their first names and <unk> rather than by their imperial titles . However , Olga 's governess and tutors also noted some of the autocratic impulses of the daughter of the Tsar of All the Russias , one of the wealthiest men in the world . On a visit to a museum where state carriages were on display , Olga once ordered one of the servants to prepare the largest and most beautiful carriage for her daily drive . Her wishes were not honored , much to the relief of her governess , Margaretta Eagar . She also felt the rights of eldest children should be protected . When she was told the Biblical story of Joseph and his coat of many colors , she sympathized with the eldest brothers rather than Joseph . She also sympathized with Goliath rather than David in the Biblical story of David and Goliath . When her French tutor , Pierre Gilliard , was teaching her the formation of French verbs and the use of auxiliaries , ten @-@ year @-@ old Olga responded , " I see , monsieur . The auxiliaries are the servants of the verbs . It 's only poor ' <unk> ' which has to shift for itself . " Olga loved to read and , unlike her four siblings , enjoyed school work . " The eldest , Olga <unk> , possessed a remarkably quick brain " , recalled her Swiss tutor , Pierre Gilliard . " She had good reasoning powers as well as initiative , a very independent manner , and a gift for swift and entertaining repartee . " She enjoyed reading about politics and read newspapers . Olga also reportedly enjoyed choosing from her mother 's book selection . When she was caught taking a book before her mother read it , Olga would jokingly tell her mother that Alexandra must wait to read the novel until Olga had determined whether it was an appropriate book for her to read . 
 Margaret Eagar also noted that Olga was bright but said she had little experience with the world because of her sheltered life . She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not had an opportunity to shop in stores or to see money exchange hands . Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace had given her a new hat as a present . Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street . She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar . When reading a history lesson , she remarked that she was glad she lived in current times , when people were good and not as evil as they had been in the past . When she was eight , in November 1903 , Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin , Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine , died of typhoid fever while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate . " My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit , and they understood that later God would take her body also to heaven " , wrote Eagar . " On Christmas morning when Olga awoke , she exclaimed at once , ' Did God send for cousin Ella 's body in the night ? ' I felt startled at such a question on Christmas morning , but answered , ' Oh , no , dear , not yet . ' She was greatly disappointed , and said , ' I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him . ' " 
 = = Adolescence and relationships with parents = = 
 " Her chief characteristics … were a strong will and a singularly straightforward habit of thought and action " , wrote her mother 's friend Anna Vyrubova , who recalled Olga 's hot temper and her struggles to keep it under control . " Admirable qualities in a woman , these same characteristics are often trying in childhood , and Olga as a little girl sometimes showed herself willful and even disobedient . " Olga idolized her father and wore a necklace with an icon of St. Nicholas on her chest . She , like her siblings , enjoyed games of tennis and swimming with her father during their summer holidays and often confided in him when she went with him on long walks . Though she also loved Alexandra , her relationship with her mother was somewhat strained during her adolescence and early adulthood . " Olga is always most unamiable about every proposition , though may end by doing what I wish " , wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on March 13 , 1916 . " And when I am severe — sulks me . " In another letter to Nicholas during World War I , Alexandra complained that Olga 's grumpiness , bad humor and general reluctance to make an official visit to the hospital where she usually worked as a Red Cross nurse made things difficult . Olga also occasionally found her mother 's attitude trying . <unk> Elizaveta Nikolaevna Ersberg told her niece that the Tsar paid closer attention to the children than Alexandra did and Alexandra often was ill with a migraine or quarreled with the servants . In 1913 , Olga complained in a letter to her grandmother , Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna about her mother 's <unk> . " As usual her heart isn 't well " , Olga wrote . " It 's all so unpleasant . " Queen Marie of Romania , who met Olga and her sisters when they visited Romania on a state trip in 1914 , commented in her memoirs that the girls were natural and confided in her when Alexandra wasn 't present , but when she appeared " they always seemed to be watching her every expression so as to be sure to act according to her desires . " 
 As an adolescent , Olga received frequent reminders from her mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses . On January 11 , 1909 , Alexandra admonished thirteen @-@ year @-@ old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior . She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants , who looked after her well and did their best for her , and she should not make her nurse " nervous " when she was tired and not feeling well . Olga responded on January 12 , 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn 't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason . However , Ersberg , one of the maids , told her niece that the servants sometimes had good reason to be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled , capricious , and lazy . On January 24 , 1909 , Alexandra scolded the active teenager , who once signed another of her letters with the nickname " Unmounted Cossack " , again : " You are growing very big — don 't be so wild and kick about and show your legs , it is not pretty . I never did so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even . " 
 Three years later , Alexandra blamed sixteen @-@ year @-@ old Olga , who was sitting beside her seven @-@ year @-@ old brother , for failing to control the misbehaving Tsarevich Alexei during a family dinner . The spoiled Alexei teased others at the table , refused to sit up in his chair , wouldn 't eat his food and licked his plate . The Tsarina 's expectation was unreasonable , said Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia , a distant cousin of the imperial family . " Olga cannot deal with him " , he wrote in his diary on March 18 , 1912 . Court official A. A. <unk> wrote that Olga was already seventeen , but still " she had the ways of a flapper " , referring to her rough manners and liking for exuberant play .

 Despite his occasional misbehavior , Olga , like all her family , doted on the long @-@ awaited heir Tsarevich Alexei , or " Baby " . The little boy suffered frequent attacks of hemophilia and nearly died several times . Like their mother , Olga and her three sisters were also potentially carriers of the hemophilia gene . Olga 's younger sister Maria reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils , according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia , who was interviewed later in her life . The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Tsarina Alexandra . Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother , who inherited the trait from her maternal grandmother Queen Victoria . Symptomatic carriers of the gene , while not <unk> themselves , can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding . 
 Olga 's mother relied on the counsel of Grigori Rasputin , a Russian peasant and wandering starets or " holy man " , and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions . Olga and her siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as " Our Friend " and to share confidences with him . In the autumn of 1907 , Olga 's aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin . Olga , her sisters and brother , were all wearing their long white nightgowns . " All the children seemed to like him " , Olga Alexandrovna recalled . " They were completely at ease with him . " 
 However , one of the girls ' governesses , Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva , was horrified in 1910 that Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns and wanted him barred . Although Rasputin 's contacts with the children were completely innocent , Nicholas asked Rasputin to avoid going to the nurseries in the future to avoid further scandal . Alexandra eventually had the governess fired . Tyutcheva took her story to other members of the family . Nicholas 's sister Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia was horrified by Tyutcheva 's story . She wrote on March 15 , 1910 that she couldn 't understand : 
 " … the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory ( whom they consider to be almost a saint , when in fact he 's only a khlyst ! ) He 's always there , goes into the nursery , visits Olga and Tatiana while they are getting ready for bed , sits there talking to them and caressing them . They are careful to hide him from Sofia Ivanovna , and the children don 't dare talk to her about him . It 's all quite unbelievable and beyond understanding . " 
 Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova , another nurse for the royal children , was at first a devotee of Rasputin , but later was disillusioned by him . She claimed that she was raped by Rasputin in the spring of 1910 . The Empress refused to believe her and said that everything Rasputin did was holy . Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova 's claim had been immediately investigated , but " they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard . " Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913 . 
 It was whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four Grand Duchesses . Rasputin had released ardent , though by all accounts completely innocent in nature , letters written by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses to him . They circulated throughout society , fueling rumors . Pornographic cartoons circulated depicting Rasputin having relations with the empress , with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background . Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time , much to Alexandra 's displeasure , and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine . Despite the rumors , the imperial family 's association with Rasputin continued until Rasputin was murdered on December 17 , 1916 . " Our Friend is so contented with our girlies , says they have gone through heavy ' courses ' for their age and their souls have much developed " , Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6 , 1916 , a few weeks before Rasputin was killed . However , as she grew older , Olga was less inclined to see Rasputin as her friend and was more aware of how his friendship with her parents affected the stability of her country . Olga wrote in her diary the day after the murder that she suspected Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia , her first cousin once removed and the man she had at one time been expected to marry , was the murderer of " Father Grigory . " Dmitri and Felix Yussupov , the husband of her first cousin Princess Irina of Russia , were among the murderers . In his memoirs , A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared " cold and visibly terribly upset " by Rasputin 's death and sat " huddled up closely together " on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news . Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed . Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on the reverse side by Olga , her sisters and mother . However , Olga was the only member of the family who did not attend Rasputin 's funeral , according to the diary of her first cousin once removed Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia . According to the memoirs of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva , a woman who nursed with Olga during World War I , Olga said in February 1917 , about a month after the murder , that while it might have been necessary for Rasputin to be killed , it should never have been done " so terribly . " She was ashamed that the murderers were her relatives . After Olga and her sisters had been killed , the Bolsheviks found that each was wearing an amulet bearing Rasputin 's image and a prayer around their necks . 
 Inspired by her religious upbringing , Olga took control of a portion of her sizable fortune when she was twenty and began to respond independently to requests for charity . One day when she was out for a drive she saw a young child using crutches . She asked about the child and learned that the youngster 's parents were too poor to afford treatment . Olga set aside an allowance to cover the child 's medical bills . A court official , Alexander <unk> , recalled that Olga 's character was " even , good , with an almost angelic kindness " by the time she was a young woman . 
 = = Romances and marital prospects = = 
 Olga was a chestnut @-@ blonde with bright blue eyes , a broad face and a turned up nose . She was considered less pretty than her sisters Maria and Tatiana , though her appearance improved as she grew older . " As a child she was plain , at fifteen she was beautiful " , wrote her mother 's friend Lili Dehn . " She was slightly above the medium height , with a fresh complexion , deep blue eyes , quantities of light chestnut hair , and pretty hands and feet . " 
 Olga and her younger sisters were surrounded by young men assigned to guard them at the palace and on the imperial yacht Standard and were used to mingling with them and sharing holiday fun during their annual summer cruises . When Olga was fifteen , a group of officers aboard the imperial yacht gave her a portrait of Michelangelo 's nude David , cut out from a newspaper , as a present for her name day on July 11 , 1911 . " Olga laughed at it long and hard " , her indignant fourteen @-@ year @-@ old sister Tatiana wrote to her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia . " And not one of the officers wishes to confess that he has done it . Such swine , aren 't they ? " 
 At the same time the teenage Olga was enjoying her innocent flirtations , society was buzzing about her future marriage . In November 1911 a full dress ball was held at Livadia to celebrate her sixteenth birthday and her entry into society . Her hair was put up for the first time and her first evening gown was pink . Her parents gave her a diamond ring and a diamond and pearl necklace as a birthday present and symbol that she had become a young woman . A. <unk> , the wife of a general and hostess of a monarchist salon , wrote in her diary the following summer , on June 7 , 1912 , that Olga had been betrothed the previous night to Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia , her first cousin once removed . In his book The Rasputin File , Edvard Radzinsky speculates that the betrothal was broken off due to Dmitri 's dislike for Grigori Rasputin , his association with Felix Yussupov and rumors that Dmitri was bisexual . However , no other sources mention an official betrothal to Dmitri Pavlovich . Before World War I , there was also some discussion of a marriage between Olga and Prince Carol of Romania , but Olga did not like Carol . During a visit to Romania in the spring of 1914 , she struggled to make small talk with the Romanian crown prince . Carol 's mother , Queen Marie of Romania , was unimpressed with Olga as well , finding her manners too brusque and her broad , high cheek @-@ boned face " not pretty . " The plans were , in any event , put on hold upon the outbreak of war in 1914 . Edward , Prince of Wales , eldest son of England 's George V , and Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia were also discussed as potential suitors , though none were considered seriously . Olga told Gilliard that she wanted to marry a Russian and remain in her own country . She said her parents would not force her to marry anyone she could not like . 
 While society was discussing matches with princes , Olga fell in love with a succession of officers . In late 1913 , Olga fell in love with Pavel Voronov , a junior officer on the imperial yacht <unk> , but such a relationship would have been impossible due to their differing ranks . Voronov was engaged a few months later to one of the ladies in waiting . " God grant him good fortune , my beloved " , a saddened Olga wrote on his wedding day , " It 's sad , distressing . " Later , in her diaries of 1915 and 1916 , Olga frequently mentioned a man named <unk> with great affection . 
 According to the diary of Valentina Chebotareva , a woman who nursed with Olga during World War I , Olga 's " golden <unk> " was Dmitri <unk> @-@ <unk> , a wounded soldier she cared for when she was a Red Cross nurse . Chebotareva wrote that Olga 's love for him was " pure , naive , without hope " and that she tried to avoid revealing her feelings to the other nurses . She talked to him regularly on the telephone , was depressed when he left the hospital , and jumped about exuberantly when she received a message from him . Dmitri <unk> @-@ <unk> adored Olga and talked of killing Rasputin for her if she only gave the word , because it was the duty of an officer to protect the imperial family even against their will . However , he also reportedly showed other officers the letters Olga had written to him when he was drunk . Another young man , Volodia <unk> , appeared to have affection for her as well . " ( He ) always has a smile or two for her " , wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on December 16 , 1916 . Chebotareva also noted in her diary Olga 's stated " dreams of happiness : " To get married , [ to ] always live in the countryside [ in ] winter and summer , [ to ] see only good people [ and ] no one official . ” Other suitors within the family were suggested , among them Olga 's first cousin once removed Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia . Alexandra refused to entertain the idea of her innocent daughter marrying the jaded , much older Boris Vladimirovich . " An inexperienced girl would suffer terribly , to have her husband 4 , or 5th hand or more " , Alexandra wrote . She was also aware that Olga 's heart lay elsewhere . 
 = = Early adulthood and World War I = = 
 Olga experienced her first brush with violence at age fifteen , when she witnessed the assassination of the government minister Pyotr Stolypin during a performance at the Kiev Opera House . " Olga and Tatiana had followed me back to the box and saw everything that happened " , Tsar Nicholas II wrote to his mother , Dowager Empress Maria , on September 10 , 1911 . " … It had made a great impression on Tatiana , who cried a lot , and they both slept badly . " Three years later , she saw gunshot wounds close up when she trained to become a Red Cross nurse . Olga , her sister Tatiana , and her mother Tsarina Alexandra treated wounded soldiers at a hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo . 
 Olga was disdainful of her cousin Princess Irina of Russia 's husband Felix Yussupov , the man who eventually murdered Rasputin in December 1916 . Yussupov had taken advantage of a law permitting men who were only sons to avoid military service . He was in civilian dress at a time when many of the Romanov men and the wounded soldiers Olga cared for were fighting . " Felix is a ' downright civilian ' , dressed all in brown , walked to and fro about the room , searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing ; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes — a man idling in such times " , Olga wrote to her father , Tsar Nicholas , on March 5 , 1915 after paying a visit to the <unk> . She was also strongly patriotic . In July 1915 , while discussing the wedding of an acquaintance with fellow nurses , Olga said she understood why the ancestry of the groom 's German grandmother was being kept hidden . " Of course he has to conceal it " , she burst out . " I quite understand him , she may perhaps be a real bloodthirsty German . " Olga 's unthinking comments hurt her mother , who had been born in Germany , reported fellow nurse Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva . Nursing during the war provided Olga and her sister Tatiana with exposure to experiences they had not previously had . The girls enjoyed talking with fellow nurses at the hospital , women they would never have met if not for the war , and knew the names of their children and their family stories . On one occasion , when a lady in waiting who usually picked up the girls from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant , the two girls decided to go shopping in a store when they had a break . They ordered the carriage driver to stop in a shopping district and went into a store where they were not recognized because of their nursing uniforms . However , they discovered that they didn 't know how to buy anything because they had never used money . The next day they asked Chebotareva how to go about purchasing an item from a store . Yet other stories tell of a regular salary of nine dollars the girls received each month , and how they used it to purchase such items as perfume and notepaper . They had also been shopping with their Aunt , Olga Alexandrovna and Olga had visited shops on a trip to Germany with her sister Tatiana 
 Olga cared for and pitied the soldiers she helped to treat . However , the stress of caring for wounded , dying men eventually also took its toll on the sensitive , moody Olga 's nerves . Her sister Maria reported in a letter that Olga broke three panes of a window on a " caprice " with her umbrella on September 5 , 1915 . On another occasion , she destroyed items in a cloakroom when she was " in a rage " , according to the memoirs of Valentina Chebotareva . On October 19 , 1915 she was assigned office work at the hospital because she was no longer able to bear the gore of the operating theater . She was given arsenic injections in October 1915 , at the time considered a treatment for depression or nervous disorders . Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden , one of her mother 's ladies in waiting , recalled that Olga had to give up nursing and instead only supervised the hospital wards because she had " <unk> herself " and became " nervous and anaemic . " 
 According to the accounts of courtiers , Olga knew the financial and political state of the country during the war and revolution . She reportedly also knew how much the Russian people disliked her mother and father . " She was by nature a thinker " , remembered Gleb Botkin , the son of the family 's physician , Yevgeny Botkin , " and as it later seemed to me , understood the general situation better than any member of her family , including even her parents . At least I had the impression that she had little illusions in regard to what the future held in store for them , and in consequence was often sad and worried . " 
 = = Captivity and death = = 
 The family were arrested during the Russian Revolution of 1917 and were imprisoned first at their home in Tsarskoye Selo and later at private residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg , Siberia . " Darling , you must know how awful it all is " , Olga wrote in a letter to a friend from Tobolsk . During the early months of 1917 , the children caught measles . Olga contracted pleurisy , as well . 
 Olga tried to draw comfort from her faith and her proximity to her family . To her " beloved mama " , with whom she had sometimes had a difficult relationship , she wrote a poem in April 1917 , while the family was still imprisoned at Tsarskoye Selo : " You are filled with anguish for the sufferings of others . And no one 's grief has ever passed you by . You are relentless , only towards yourself , forever cold and pitiless . But if only you could look upon your own sadness from a distance , just once with a loving soul — Oh , how you would pity yourself , how sadly you would weep . " In another letter from Tobolsk , Olga wrote : " Father asks to … remember that the evil which is now in the world will become yet more powerful , and that it is not evil which conquers evil , but only love … " 
 A poem copied into one of her notebooks prays for patience and the ability to forgive her enemies : 
 " Send us , Lord , the patience , in this year of stormy , gloom @-@ filled days , to suffer popular oppression , and the tortures of our hangmen . Give us strength , oh Lord of justice , Our neighbor 's evil to forgive , And the Cross so heavy and bloody , with Your humility to meet , In days when enemies rob us , To bear the shame and humiliation , Christ our Savior , help us . Ruler of the world , God of the universe , Bless us with prayer and give our humble soul rest in this unbearable , dreadful hour . At the threshold of the grave , breathe into the lips of Your slaves inhuman strength — to pray meekly for our enemies . " 
 Also found with Olga 's effects , reflecting her own determination to remain faithful to the father she adored , was Edmond Rostand 's L 'Aiglon , the story of Napoleon Bonaparte 's son , who remained loyal to his deposed father until the end of his life . 
 There was one report that her father gave Olga a small revolver , which she concealed in a boot while in captivity at <unk> Selo and at Tobolsk . Colonel Eugene <unk> , their sympathetic jailer , pleaded with the grand duchess to surrender her revolver before she , her sisters , and brother were transferred to Yekaterinburg . Olga reluctantly gave up her gun and was left unarmed . 
 The family had been briefly separated in April 1918 when the Bolsheviks moved Nicholas , Alexandra , and Maria to Yekaterinburg . Alexei and the three other young women remained behind because Alexei had suffered another attack of hemophilia . The Empress chose Maria to accompany her because " Olga 's spirits were too low " and level @-@ headed Tatiana was needed to take care of Alexei . In May 1918 the remaining children and servants boarded the ship Rus that ferried them from Tobolsk to Yekaterinburg . Aboard ship , Olga was distressed when she saw one of the guards slip from a ladder and injure his foot . She ran to the man and explained that she had been a nurse during the war and wanted to look at his foot . He refused her offer of treatment . All through the afternoon , Olga fretted over the guard , whom she called " her poor fellow . " At Tobolsk Olga and her sisters had sewed jewels into their clothing in hopes of hiding them from the Bolsheviks , since Alexandra had written to warn them that upon arrival in Ekaterinburg , she , Nicholas and Maria had been aggressively searched and belongings confiscated . 
 Pierre Gilliard later recalled his last sight of the imperial children at Yekaterinburg : 
 At the Ipatiev House , Olga and her sisters were eventually required to do their own laundry and learned how to make bread . The girls took turns keeping Alexandra company and amusing Alexei , who was still confined to bed and suffering from pain after his latest injury . Olga was reportedly deeply depressed and lost a great deal of weight during her final months . " She was thin , pale , and looked very sick " , recalled one of the guards , Alexander Strekotin , in his memoirs . " She took few walks in the garden , and spent most of her time with her brother . " Another guard recalled that the few times she did walk outside , she stood there " gazing sadly into the distance , making it easy to read her emotions . " Later , Olga appeared angry with her younger sister Maria for being too friendly to the guards , reported Strekotin . After late June , when a new command was installed , the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the conditions of their imprisonment became even more stringent . 
 On July 14 , 1918 , local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family and reported that Olga and her family , contrary to custom , fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead . The following day , on July 15 , Olga and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked with one another and moved the beds in their room so visiting cleaning women could scrub the floor . They got down on their hands and knees to help the women and whispered to them when the guards weren 't looking . All four young women wore long black skirts and white silk blouses , the same clothing they had worn the previous day . Their short hair was " tumbled and disorderly . " They told the women how much they enjoyed physical exertion and wished there was more of it for them to do in the Ipatiev House . Olga appeared sickly . As the family was eating dinner that night , Yakov Yurovsky , the head of the detachment , came in and announced that the family 's kitchen boy and Alexei 's playmate , 14 @-@ year @-@ old Leonid Sednev , must gather his things and go to a family member . The boy had actually been sent to a hotel across the street because the guards did not want to kill him along with the rest of the Romanov party . The family , unaware of the plan to kill them , was upset and unsettled by Sednev 's absence . Dr. Eugene Botkin and Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky 's office , for what was to be the last time , to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity . Yurovsky placated them by telling them the boy would return soon , but the family was unconvinced . 
 Late that night , on the night of July 16 , the family was awakened and told to come down to the lower level of the house because there was unrest in the town at large and they would have to be moved for their own safety . The family emerged from their rooms carrying pillows , bags , and other items to make Alexandra and Alexei comfortable . The family paused and crossed themselves when they saw the stuffed mother bear and cubs that stood on the landing , perhaps as a sign of respect for the dead . Nicholas told the servants and family " Well , we 're going to get out of this place . " They asked questions of the guards but did not appear to suspect they were going to be killed . Yurovsky , who had been a professional photographer , directed the family to take different positions as a photographer might . Alexandra , who had complained about the lack of chairs for herself and Alexei , sat to her son 's left . The Tsar stood behind Alexei , Dr. Botkin stood to the Tsar 's right , Olga and her sisters stood behind Alexandra along with the servants . They were left for approximately half an hour while further preparations were made . The group said little during this time , but Alexandra whispered to the girls in English , violating the guard 's rules that they must speak in Russian . Yurovsky came in , ordered them to stand , and read the sentence of execution . Olga and her mother attempted to make the sign of the cross and the rest of the family had time only to utter a few incoherent sounds of shock or protest before the death squad under Yurovsky 's command began shooting . It was the early hours of July 17 , 1918 . 
 The initial round of gunfire killed only the Tsar , the Empress and two male servants , and wounded Grand Duchess Maria , Dr Botkin and the Empress ' maidservant , Demidova . At that point the gunmen had to leave the room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had released from the walls . After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes , the gunmen returned . Dr Botkin was killed , and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei , but failed because jewels sewn into the boy 's clothes shielded him . Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again , and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy 's head . Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana , who were crouched against the room 's rear wall , clinging to each other and screaming for their mother . Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8 @-@ inch bayonet , but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises . The sisters tried to stand , but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her in the back of her head . A moment later , Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the jaw . 
 Several people claimed to be surviving members of the Romanov family following the assassinations . A woman named Marga Boodts claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga . Boodts lived in a villa on Lake Como in Italy and was said to be supported by the former <unk> , Wilhelm II and by the Pope . Prince Sigismund of Prussia , son of Alexandra 's sister , Irene , said he accepted her as Olga , and Sigismund also supported Anastasia claimant Anna Anderson . His mother , Irene , did not believe either woman . Most historians discount her claim and believe Olga died with her family . Michael <unk> , an Alexei pretender , claimed his ' sisters ' were Olga and Tatiana , and the entire family had escaped . 
 Remains later identified through DNA testing as the Romanovs and their servants were discovered in the woods outside Yekaterinburg in 1991 . Two bodies , Alexei and one of his sisters , generally thought to be either Maria or Anastasia , were missing . On August 23 , 2007 , a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned , partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky 's memoirs . The archaeologists said the bones are from a boy who was roughly between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of eighteen and twenty @-@ three years old . Anastasia was seventeen years , one month old at the time of the assassination , while her sister Maria was nineteen years , one month old and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday . Olga and Tatiana were twenty @-@ two and twenty @-@ one years old at the time of the assassination . Along with the remains of the two bodies , archaeologists found " shards of a container of sulfuric acid , nails , metal strips from a wooden box , and bullets of various caliber . " The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes . 
 Preliminary testing indicated a " high degree of probability " that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters , Russian forensic scientists announced on January 22 , 2008 . The Yekaterinburg region 's chief forensic expert Nikolai <unk> indicated the results would be compared against those obtained by foreign experts . On April 30 , 2008 , Russian forensic scientists announced that DNA testing confirms that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters . In March 2009 , Dr. Michael Coble of the US Armed Forces DNA Identification Lab published the final , peer reviewed results of the recent tests on the 2007 remains , comparing them with the 1991 remains , concluding the entire family died together in 1918 . Russian and Austrian scientists got the same results . This finding confirms that all of the Tsar 's family were accounted for .

 = New York State Route 394 = 
 New York State Route 394 ( NY 394 ) is a state highway located within Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties in southwestern New York in the United States . Its western terminus is located on the shore of Lake Erie at an intersection with NY 5 in the Westfield hamlet of Barcelona . The eastern terminus is located at an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway ( Interstate 86 or I @-@ 86 and NY 17 ) at the Coldspring hamlet of Steamburg . From Mayville to Jamestown , NY 394 follows the western edge of Chautauqua Lake . East of Jamestown , the route straddles the Southern Tier Expressway and connects to the highway in four different locations , including at its eastern terminus . 
 The segments of NY 394 between Westfield and Mayville , as well as east of Jamestown were originally designated as NY 17 in 1924 . Six years later , the remainder of current NY 394 gained a pair of designations as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York ; however , by the mid @-@ 1940s , the Mayville – Jamestown stretch was solely designated as New York State Route 17J . In November 1973 , NY 17 was realigned onto the new Southern Tier Expressway east of Jamestown . The former alignment of NY 17 between Jamestown and Steamburg and all of NY 17J were redesignated as NY 394 . NY 394 was extended westward to Barcelona shortly afterward . Today the route is also concurrent with part of New York State Bicycle Route 17 .

 NY 394 begins at an intersection with NY 5 ( here part of the Seaway Trail ) in Barcelona , on the shore of Lake Erie . The route heads to the southeast , paralleling Chautauqua Creek and meeting the New York State Thruway ( I @-@ 90 ) at exit 60 a quarter @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 4 km ) from NY 5 . NY 394 crosses over the Thruway and enters the village of Westfield , passing baseball fields and local businesses ahead of an intersection with U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) . The road continues through the outskirts of Westfield , passing more local businesses and parks . After the intersection with East Campbell Avenue , NY 394 leaves Westfield and heads into rural regions of Chautauqua County . 
 After leaving Westfield , NY 394 heads to the southeast towards Mayville through predominantly farmland and open fields . Here , NY 394 is known as South Portage Road as it winds its way southeast through the town of Chautauqua . The highway leaves the vicinity of Chautauqua Creek shortly after entering the town . Roughly 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from the creek , NY 394 enters the Mayville village limits upon intersecting <unk> Road . Within the village , NY 394 passes by Chautauqua Lake Central School ahead of a junction with NY 430 , a road ultimately leading westward to Erie , Pennsylvania . Past the intersection , both NY 394 and NY 430 begin to parallel Chautauqua Lake as they head southeastward , with NY 394 following the western edge of the water body . 
 = = = Chautauqua Lake = = = 
 Outside of Mayville , the highway reenters the town of Chautauqua and goes along the shore of the lake . NY 394 intersects with some local roads as it approaches the Chautauqua Institution , where it passes the Chautauqua Golf Club just west of the grounds . Just south of the golf club is an access road to a fish hatchery maintained by the state . NY 394 leaves Chautauqua quickly and passes to the east of Willow Run Golf Course . After intersections with County Route 18 ( CR 18 , named Magnolia – Stedman Road ) and CR 16 ( Stow Road ) , NY 394 turns southward and meets the Southern Tier Expressway ( I @-@ 86 and NY 17 ) at exit 8 less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from Bemus Point . 
 South of the expressway , NY 394 remains the primary lakeside roadway as it passes through the communities of Quigley Park and Cheney 's Point . NY 394 turns back to the southeast at an intersection with CR 43 , passing Edward F. Loomis Park and remaining on the now @-@ southern edge of Chautauqua Lake . As the route approaches Lakewood , traffic generally becomes more dense and it intersects NY 474 , a largely rural roadway linking the Jamestown area to Wattsburg , Pennsylvania . NY 394 continues onward through Lakewood and into Jamestown , where the lake comes to an end near an intersection with Jackson Avenue . 
 = = = Jamestown area = = = 
 NY 394 , initially known as Sixth Street within the city limits , splits into a one @-@ way pair after crossing the <unk> River . At this point , eastbound NY 394 shifts one block south to follow Fifth Street while westbound NY 394 remains on Sixth . Between Washington Street and North Main Street , NY 394 is concurrent with NY 60 , with NY 60 south overlapping NY 394 west on Sixth Street and NY 60 north overlapping NY 394 east on Fifth . The one @-@ way pair remains intact through downtown to Prendergast Avenue , where NY 394 comes back together and shifts south onto Fourth Street . Two blocks later , NY 394 veers onto Second Street and passes south of Jamestown Community College before exiting the city . The portion of NY 394 within Jamestown from the western city line to Prendergast Avenue is maintained by the city and is the only section of the route not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation . 
 In nearby Falconer , the route becomes Main Street and intersects with CR 380 , an extension of former NY 380 . The highway heads to the northeast through the village , intersecting with local roads before connecting to the Southern Tier Expressway again at exit 13 . The road parallels the expressway as both head northeast out of Falconer . 
 = = = Poland and Cattaraugus County = = = 
 Outside of Falconer , NY 394 enters the town of Poland and heads northeast to the hamlet of Kennedy , home to a junction with US 62 . US 62 and NY 394 become concurrent and head through Kennedy to Schermerhorn Corners , where US 62 leaves to the north . NY 394 continues eastward , passing into Cattaraugus County and meeting the Southern Tier Expressway at exit 15 by way of Schoolhouse Road . The segment of Schoolhouse Road between NY 394 and the freeway is designated as NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . NY 394 enters the hamlet of Randolph roughly 3 miles ( 5 km ) later and intersects with both the Southern Tier Expressway at exit 16 via Main Street ( unsigned NY <unk> ) and NY 241 . Outside of Randolph , NY 394 separates from the expressway and follows a northeasterly routing to the neighboring hamlet of East Randolph . Here , the route meets NY 242 as it turns southward toward the Southern Tier Expressway once again . 
 NY 394 leaves East Randolph and heads southward through the town of Coldspring , where it rejoins the corridor of the Southern Tier Expressway about 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) from East Randolph . The two highways follow parallel routings for an additional 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) to exit 17 on the expressway ( at the hamlet of Steamburg ) , where NY 394 terminates . Past the interchange , the right @-@ of @-@ way of NY 394 continues southward along the Allegheny Reservoir past the <unk> Marina to the Pennsylvania state line ( a distance of 12 @.@ 76 miles or 20 @.@ 54 kilometres ) as unsigned NY <unk> .

 = = = Westfield – Mayville corridor = = = 
 The Westfield – Mayville corridor was originally connected by way of a 9 @-@ mile ( 14 km ) long Native American trail . French explorers , led by Étienne Brûlé , apparently discovered the trail in 1615 and used it periodically thereafter ; since Brûlé did not write about his journeys and the only evidence of them comes from secondhand sources , the tribes who originally occupied the territory at the time of Brûlé 's pass @-@ through remain unknown ( in contrast , Joseph de La Roche <unk> , who conducted a missionary journey further east in 1626 , kept meticulous notes that to this day are the only surviving accounts of pre @-@ Beaver Wars native activity in Western New York ) . In 1749 , an expedition under the command of Pierre Joseph <unk> de Blainville landed at the mouth of Chautauqua Creek on Lake Erie with the intent of claiming the Ohio Valley for the French . They hacked out a road to Chautauqua Lake through the forests that lined the trail on their way to the Allegheny River and thus to the Ohio River . 
 Another French expedition in 1753 converted the portage road into a military road . The road was still in evidence in 1802 when settlers first moved into the area . They called it the " Old French Road " and the Holland Land Company used it as the western end of Chautauqua Road , the first road cut through the Southern Tier of Western New York . Remnants of the portage road remain to this day : most of NY 394 between the two waterbodies is named Portage Street , and a loop road off NY 394 south of the village of Westfield is called Old Portage Road . 
 = = = Designations = = = 
 When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , what is now NY 394 from Westfield to Mayville , as well as from Jamestown to Steamburg , was designated as part of NY 17 , a cross @-@ state highway extending across the Southern Tier from Westfield to New Jersey . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , an alternate route of NY 17 from Mayville to Jamestown was designated as NY 17J from Mayville to Ashville and part of NY 74 from Ashville to Jamestown . In the mid @-@ 1930s , NY 17J was extended eastward to rejoin NY 17 at Washington Street in Jamestown , creating an overlap with NY 74 . This overlap was eliminated in the mid @-@ 1940s when NY 74 was truncated to Ashville . NY 17 , meanwhile , was extended to Barcelona to meet NY 5 by 1946 . 
 Construction began on a new limited @-@ access highway through Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties ( part of the modern Southern Tier Expressway ) in the mid @-@ 1960s . The initial section of the highway , extending from Kennedy ( exit 14 ) to Randolph ( exit 16 ) , opened to traffic by 1967 and became part of a rerouted NY 17 in the late 1960s . By November 1973 , the expressway had been extended west to Fluvanna ( exit 11 ) and east to Steamburg ( exit 18 ) . NY 17 was then realigned to follow the expressway while its former routing from Jamestown to Steamburg , as well as all of NY 17J , was redesignated as NY 394 . By 1977 , the Southern Tier Expressway was completed up to exit 10 in Bemus Point . 
 In the late 1970s , NY 394 was extended northwestward to Barcelona , overlapping NY 17 . The concurrency was only temporary as NY 17 was realigned to follow the Southern Tier Expressway from Bemus Point to Mina once that segment was completed in the early 1980s . On April 1 , 1980 , ownership and maintenance of NY 394 from Westfield to Barcelona was transferred from Chautauqua County to New York State as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government .

 = Tillson Harrison = 
 Tillson Lever Harrison ( January 7 , 1881 – January 10 , 1947 ) was a Canadian physician , army officer and adventurer . Moving to New York and enlisting in the United States Army at an early age , he later returned to Canada to attend the University of Toronto before practising as a physician in a number of dangerous positions , such as the Chief of Medical Staff to Pancho Villa and the doctor for the Chinese Labour Corps , a workforce of over 200 @,@ 000 men . After World War I , he traveled throughout the Middle East , treating venereal disease and operating an X @-@ ray facility in Lod , Israel . 
 After attempting to elope with one of his Middle East hospital patients , Harrison was deported to Canada but managed to jump ship in Morocco and join the Free State Army . In the 1930s , he traveled through 15 countries and dependencies performing medical duties , and served as a ship 's doctor on a liner that crossed the Indian Ocean during World War II . From 1946 until his death , he assisted in the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ( UNRRA ) in China , saving many lives . 
 By the end of his life , Harrison could speak six languages , had participated in seven wars , and was married to four women at the same time . His daughter Rosalind said that the character Indiana Jones was based on him . According to Rosalind , film producers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg contacted her after her father 's death and conducted a series of interviews , during which she provided an account of his life . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Harrison was born on January 7 , 1881 , in Tillsonburg , Ontario , a town named for his great @-@ grandfather George . His grandfather , Edwin <unk> Tillson , was the builder of what is now the Annandale National Historic Site . As a child , Harrison was considered a troublemaker . On one occasion he locked his grandmother in her bedroom and on another became a local newspaper sensation after his attempt to travel to Cuba was discovered . In 1894 , he was enrolled at the Upper Canada College in Toronto , but left the next year . At the age of 14 , he ran away to join the 22nd Oxford Rifles militia , headquartered in Oxford County , but was returned home when it was discovered that he was underage . Soon after , he moved to New York to join the United States Army Engineers and serve as part of the peacekeeping force in the Philippines after the defeat of Spain in 1898 , and for a brief period to help put down the Boxer Rebellion in China . Mostly involved in the running of labor gangs building supply roads to remote areas , Harrison was involved in only one firefight . However , when his maternal grandfather , Edwin " E.D. " Tillson ( whose company evolved into Quaker Oats ) , discovered what the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was doing , he used his connections to influence General Adna Chaffee into issuing a general order for the recall of Harrison from the field . While serving with the US Army , Harrison contracted cholera and returned to Canada . Using the inheritance he had received from his recently deceased grandfather , Harrison began attending the University of Toronto medical school before marrying Sybil Wilkin , a lawyer 's daughter , in 1905 . 
 After his graduation from medical school in 1907 , Harrison gained employment with the Hudson 's Bay Company and began treating the Cree community of Alberta and acting as the local postmaster . Soon after , Harrison again moved his family to Washington , Idaho and finally <unk> , Oregon , where he became a doctor , pharmacist , mayor , developer and rancher . In 1909 , Harrison fathered a daughter , Rosalind , with his wife Sybil . In 1912 , the Journal of the American Medical Association published an article written by Harrison , titled " Cesarean Section Under Difficulties " , which documented a caesarean section he performed in a remote ranch @-@ house lit by an oil lamp . Because of his restless nature , Harrison left his family in Oregon and traveled to London in 1913 to undergo postgraduate work in gynecology and obstetrics . When World War I began in 1914 , Harrison assisted in the war effort in Belgium . While there , he met a Turkish woman named Eva , and married her without divorcing his first wife . In 1915 , Harrison and his new wife traveled to El Paso , Texas , to settle down . 
 = = North American conflict and World War I = = 
 Shortly after arriving in Texas , Harrison took the dangerous job of Chief of Medical Staff to Mexican revolutionary general Pancho Villa . In one situation , Harrison was captured by Villa 's foe Venustiano Carranza , later the President of Mexico . The doctor was sentenced to death , but when Carranza became ill , Harrison was spared as he was the only qualified physician available . Harrison kept the general in a state of near @-@ recovery , enabling him to escape and deliver military information to US forces stationed along the border . 
 After a brief stay among the Mormon community of southern Utah , Harrison enlisted in the Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1917 and was stationed at a French hospital , where he tended to the needs of the Chinese Labour Corps . Quickly learning the language and customs of this group of some 200 @,@ 000 men , Harrison successfully treated many bilharzia , catarrh and tuberculosis cases , significantly reducing the number of sick members of the Corps during the winter of 1917 – 18 . 
 = = Interwar period = = 
 After World War I , Harrison traveled the Middle East performing medical duties such as treating prostitutes afflicted with venereal disease in Constantinople and operating an X @-@ ray facility in Lod , Israel . Although still not legally divorced from his first two wives , Harrison married Filomena Abela , a Maltese woman at Alexandria in 1920 . However , the newlyweds could not find escape from the adventure that had followed Harrison all his life . Harrison and his new wife 's train was ambushed by a band of Syrians disillusioned with a group of politicians . The quick thinking of the recently thrice @-@ married physician prevented his new wife 's broken leg from developing into gangrene . 
 Still in charge of the Constantinople hospital , he attempted to elope with one of his patients , but was captured and tried for breach of conduct , as the female patient was in fact the wife of a Turkish officer . While being deported to Canada , Harrison escaped while his ship was docked in Morocco . Making his way to Ireland , Harrison posed as a Catholic and joined the Free State Army . After he was discovered , he quickly crossed to Wales to treat the coal miners there for silicosis . In 1923 Harrison married his fourth wife , Eva Olwen Bowen in Cardiff , still without divorcing his three previous wives , and set off with her on an adventure in the Caribbean . It is thought that Harrison deserted her sometime in the mid @-@ 1920s . During the 1930s Harrison worked in 15 countries and dependencies across Latin America and the Middle East . For one year , he served as the physician for a guerrilla army fighting the Japanese , who were then engaged in the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War with China . After 1938 , Harrison traveled to Shanghai using borrowed funds from a medical school classmate in Jamaica and from his own brother in Ontario , and set up a private medical practice , assisting the Chinese Red Cross wherever possible . 
 = = World War II and beyond = = 
 Between 1941 and 1946 , Harrison was the ship 's doctor on board the <unk> , a steam liner ferrying supplies to Allied forces across the Indian Ocean . After the war , Harrison wanted to assist the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ( UNRRA ) , but had to falsify his records by subtracting seven years off his age to qualify for service . During this time , he served in China delivering much @-@ needed supplies to a country devastated by the long Second Sino @-@ Japanese War and once even saved the lives of 90 students by sheltering them from a Kuomintang officer . By donning an American army officer 's uniform , Harrison was able to convince the Kuomintang officer to not check a barge which held the students hidden inside . 
 On December 4 , 1946 , Harrison set out from Shanghai with approximately 50 tonnes of supplies . On this train journey , he was to be accompanied by a Russian UNRRA worker and Chinese welfare representatives . Due to repeated Kuomintang inspections , the train journey constantly suffered from delays . The first such delay occurred at Nanjing and lasted four days ; the second such delay , at Xuzhou , was of equal duration . At one station , the medical supplies were unhooked from the train 's engine car and left on a bleak plain . The two UNRRA workers did not have clean water to drink and were forced to boil ditch water which was polluted with human waste . To add to the dire situation , Harrison 's blanket and shoes were stolen , and due to the cold , he began to suffer from frostbite . Two weeks after Harrison left Shanghai , his train was permitted to move again , but there were problems still ahead . At each one of the 20 stations en route to Kaifeng , the train was delayed for up to three hours . Upon arrival at Kaifeng , the journey had to be completed by truck and ox cart . After completing one delivery , he returned to Kaifeng to pick up a second load , but could not continue past the <unk> branch of the receiving hospital . Harrison died of exposure on January 10 , 1947 , near Kaifeng in China , aged 66 . 
 By the end of his life , Tillson Harrison could speak no less than six different languages , had participated in seven wars and , although this was not discovered for several years after his death , was married to four women at the same time . 
 While he is virtually unknown in Canada , Harrison is widely honored in China . A statue in his likeness stands tall in Shanghai , his burial site at an Anglican compound in Kaifeng is home to the Dr. Tillson Harrison Memorial School , and the Harrison International Peace Hospital in <unk> treats approximately 800 outpatients every day . The town of Tillsonburg , Ontario ( named for Harrison 's great @-@ grandfather ) maintains a lasting relationship with the hospital , which was renamed as such from the previous name of Handan International Peace Hospital in 1947 . In 1988 , the Prime Minister of Canada , Brian Mulroney , sent a commemorative letter to the Chinese ambassador to mark the centenary of Harrison 's birth . However at that time it was not made clear that Harrison had falsified his age when enlisting in the UNRRA , and the celebrations took place seven years after the actual centenary . The same year , Harrison 's remains were re @-@ interred in a large tomb in a public ceremony , which many Canadians were invited to attend . 
 According to Harrison 's daughter , Rosalind , several decades after her father 's death , film producers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg contacted her , and in a series of interviews , Rosalind provided an account of her father 's illustrious life . This , she claims , became the inspiration for the highly successful Indiana Jones film series . In recent times , Harrison was the subject of a five @-@ part CBC Radio Morningside dramatization of his life , written by Antanas <unk> . 
 = Gambler ( Madonna song ) = 
 " Gambler " is a song by American singer Madonna from the soundtrack album to the 1985 film Vision Quest . The song was written solely by Madonna , while the production was handled by John " Jellybean " Benitez at her request . It was released as the second single from the film 's soundtrack album in September 1985 , by Geffen Records . " Gambler " was never released in the United States , at the request of Madonna 's own Sire Records . The music video of the song is an excerpt from the film . 
 Musically , " Gambler " is an upbeat synthpop and disco song , featuring instrumentation from drums , electronic handclaps and percussion , which is accompanied by a bass synth and keyboards . The lyrics talk about Madonna asserting her self @-@ independence . Critics gave a mixed review of the song , but it was commercially successful , reaching the top @-@ ten in the charts of Australia , Belgium , Ireland , Italy , Netherlands , Norway and the United Kingdom . Madonna has performed the song only once , on her 1985 The Virgin Tour , which was documented on the live video release Madonna Live : The Virgin Tour . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the recording of " Crazy for You " , the soundtrack single for the 1985 coming of age drama Vision Quest , Madonna approached John " Jellybean " Benitez to produce another of her self @-@ written songs called " Gambler " . Subsequently , the song was added to the soundtrack of the film , as music producer Phil Ramone felt that it would be appropriate for using in the beginning shots of the film . As the song was recorded on the Geffen label , a commercial issue of the single , in the United States was suppressed , at the request of Madonna 's Sire Records management . They feared that commercial availability of another Madonna single would have been detrimental to the other singles from the Like a Virgin album , and the already available , Geffen @-@ distributed , " Crazy for You " . Hence " Gambler " was never released , or sent for airplay in the United States . The UK 12 " single , contained the Extended Dance Mix , Instrumental Remix , and the song " Nature of the Beach " by Black ' n Blue . The 7 " single had the original version , and " Nature of the Beach " . The video for " Gambler " is similar to " Crazy for You " , with Madonna singing the song along with clips culled from Vision Quest . Madonna filmed her performance on November 22 , 1983 , at the Big Foot Tavern in Spokane , Washington . " Gambler " remained Madonna 's last single written entirely by herself for over two decades , until " Hey You " ( 2007 ) . According to Stylus Magazine , Madonna said that she got too lazy to write songs without help .
