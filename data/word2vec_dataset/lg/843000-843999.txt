 = = = Rise and fall of Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire = = = 
 Constantine the Great effectively became the emperor of the whole of the Roman Empire in September 324 . Two months later , he laid out the plans for a new , Christian city to replace Byzantium . As the eastern capital of the empire , the city was named Nova Roma ; most called it Constantinople , a name that persisted into the 20th century . On 11 May 330 , Constantinople was proclaimed the capital of the Roman Empire , which was later permanently divided between the two sons of Theodosius I upon his death on 17 January 395 , when the city became the capital of the Eastern Roman ( Byzantine ) Empire . 
 The establishment of Constantinople served as one of Constantine 's most lasting accomplishments , shifting Roman power eastward as the city became a center of Greek culture and Christianity . Numerous churches were built across the city , including the Hagia Sophia which was built during the reign of Justinian the Great and remained the world 's largest cathedral for a thousand years . Constantine also undertook a major renovation and expansion of the Hippodrome of Constantinople ; accommodating tens of thousands of spectators , the hippodrome became central to civic life and , in the 5th and 6th centuries , the epicenter of episodes of unrest , including the Nika riots . Constantinople 's location also ensured its existence would stand the test of time ; for many centuries , its walls and seafront protected Europe against invaders from the east and the advance of Islam . During most of the Middle Ages , the latter part of the Byzantine era , Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city on the European continent and at times the largest in the world . 
 Constantinople began to decline continuously after the end of the reign of Basil II in 1025 . The final blow was given by the conquest of <unk> and Enrico Dandolo in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade , where the City was sacked and pillaged . The city subsequently became the center of the Latin Empire , created by Catholic crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire . Hagia Sophia was converted to a catholic church in 1204 . The Byzantine Empire was restored , albeit weakened , in 1261 . Constantinople 's churches , defenses , and basic services were in disrepair , and its population had dwindled to a hundred thousand from half a million during the 8th century . After the reconquest of 1261 , however some of the City 's monuments were restored , like the 2 <unk> mosaics in <unk> Sofia and <unk> were created . 
 Various economic and military policies instituted by Andronikos II , such as the reduction of military forces , weakened the empire and left it vulnerable to attack . In the mid @-@ 14th @-@ century , the Ottoman Turks began a strategy of gradually taking smaller towns and cities , cutting off Constantinople 's supply routes and strangling it slowly . On 29 May 1453 , after an eight @-@ week siege ( during which the last Roman emperor , Constantine XI , was killed ) , Sultan Mehmed II " the Conqueror " captured Constantinople and declared it the new capital of the Ottoman Empire . Hours later , the sultan rode to the Hagia Sophia and summoned an imam to proclaim the Islamic creed , converting the grand cathedral into an imperial mosque due to the city 's refusal to surrender peacefully . Mehmed declared himself as the new " <unk> @-@ i Rûm " ( the Ottoman Turkish equivalent of Caesar of Rome ) and the Ottoman state was reorganized into an empire . 
 = = = Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic eras = = = 
 Following the conquest of Constantinople , Mehmed II immediately set out to revitalize the city , by then also known as Istanbul . He urged the return of those who had fled the city during the siege , and resettled Muslims , Jews , and Christians from other parts of Anatolia . He demanded that five thousand households needed to be transferred to Constantinople by September . From all over the Islamic empire , prisoners of war and deported people were sent to the city : these people were called " <unk> " in Turkish ( Greek : <unk> ) . However , many people escaped again from the city , and there were several outbreaks of plague , so that in 1459 Mehmet allowed the deported Greeks to come back to the city . He also invited people from all over Europe to his capital , creating a cosmopolitan society that persisted through much of the Ottoman period . Plague continued , however , to be essentially endemic in Istanbul for the rest of the century , as it had been from 1520 , with a few years of respite between 1529 and 1533 , 1549 and 1552 , and from 1567 to 1570 ; epidemics originating in the West and in the Hejaz and southern Russia . Population growth in Anatolia , however , allowed Istanbul to replace its losses and maintain its population of around 500 @,@ 000 inhabitants down to 1800 . Mehmed II also repaired the city 's damaged infrastructure , including the whole water system , began to build the Grand Bazaar , and constructed Topkapı Palace , the sultan 's official residence . With the transfer of the capital from Edirne ( formerly Adrianople ) to Constantinople , the new state was declared as the successor and continuation of the Roman Empire . 
 The Ottomans quickly transformed the city from a bastion of Christianity to a symbol of Islamic culture . Religious foundations were established to fund the construction of ornate imperial mosques , often adjoined by schools , hospitals , and public baths . The Ottoman Dynasty claimed the status of caliphate in 1517 , with Istanbul remaining the capital of this last caliphate for four centuries . Suleiman the Magnificent 's reign from 1520 to 1566 was a period of especially great artistic and architectural achievement ; chief architect Mimar Sinan designed several iconic buildings in the city , while Ottoman arts of ceramics , stained glass , calligraphy , and miniature flourished . The population of Istanbul was 570 @,@ 000 by the end of the 18th century . 
 A period of rebellion at the start of the 19th century led to the rise of the progressive Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the Tanzimat period , which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city . Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period , and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s . Modern facilities , such as a water supply network , electricity , telephones , and trams , were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades , although later than to other European cities . The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire . 
 In the early 20th century , the Young Turk Revolution deposed Sultan Abdul Hamid II and a series of wars plagued the ailing empire 's capital . The last of these , World War I , resulted in the British , French , and Italian occupation of Constantinople . The Armenian population of the city was also affected by the deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915 , in which leaders of the Armenian community were arrested and mostly killed as part of the Armenian Genocide . To commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide , 24 April has now become the day of remembrance . The final Ottoman sultan , Mehmed VI , was exiled in November 1922 ; the following year , the occupation of Constantinople ended with the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne and the recognition of the Republic of Turkey , declared by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk . 
 In the early years of the republic , Istanbul was overlooked in favor of Ankara , selected as Turkey 's capital to distance the new , secular country from its Ottoman history . From the late 1940s and early 1950s , Istanbul underwent great structural change , as new public squares , boulevards , and avenues were constructed throughout the city , sometimes at the expense of historical buildings . The population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase in the 1970s , as people from Anatolia migrated to the city to find employment in the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis . This sudden , sharp rise in the city 's population caused a large demand for housing , and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the metropolitan area of Istanbul . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Istanbul is located in north @-@ western Turkey within the Marmara Region on a total area of 5 @,@ 343 square kilometers ( 2 @,@ 063 sq mi ) . The Bosphorus , which connects the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea , divides the city into a European , Thracian side — comprising the historic and economic centers — and an Asian , Anatolian side . The city is further divided by the Golden Horn , a natural harbor bounding the peninsula where the former Byzantium and Constantinople were founded . The confluence of the Sea of Marmara , the Bosphorus , and the Golden Horn at the heart of present @-@ day Istanbul has deterred attacking forces for thousands of years and remains a prominent feature of the city 's landscape . 
 Following the model of Rome , the historic peninsula is said to be characterized by seven hills , each topped by imperial mosques . The easternmost of these hills is the site of Topkapı Palace on the Sarayburnu . Rising from the opposite side of the Golden Horn is another , conical hill , where the modern Beyoğlu district is situated . Because of the topography , buildings in Beyoğlu were once constructed with the help of terraced retaining walls , and roads were laid out in the form of steps . Üsküdar on the Asian side exhibits similarly hilly characteristics , with the terrain gradually extending down to the Bosphorus coast , but the landscape in <unk> and <unk> is more abrupt , akin to a promontory . The highest point in Istanbul is <unk> Hill , with an altitude of 288 meters ( 945 ft ) . The northern half of Istanbul has a higher mean elevation compared to the south coast , with locations surpassing 200 meters ( 660 ft ) , and some coasts with steep cliffs resembling fjords , especially around the northern end of the Bosporus , where it opens up to the Black Sea . 
 Istanbul is situated near the North Anatolian Fault , close to the boundary between the African and Eurasian Plates . This fault zone , which runs from northern Anatolia to the Sea of Marmara , has been responsible for several deadly earthquakes throughout the city 's history . Among the most devastating of these seismic events was the 1509 earthquake , which caused a tsunami that broke over the walls of the city and killed more than 10 @,@ 000 people . More recently , in 1999 , an earthquake with its epicenter in nearby İzmit left 18 @,@ 000 people dead , including 1 @,@ 000 people in Istanbul 's suburbs . The people of Istanbul remain concerned that an even more catastrophic seismic event may be in the city 's near future , as thousands of structures recently built to accommodate Istanbul 's rapidly increasing population may not have been constructed properly . <unk> say the risk of a 7 @.@ 6 @-@ magnitude or greater earthquake striking Istanbul by 2030 is more than 60 percent . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 In the Köppen – Geiger classification system , Istanbul has a borderline Mediterranean climate ( Csa ) , humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) and oceanic climate ( Cfb ) , due to its location in a transitional climatic zone . Since precipitation in summer months , ranges from 20 to 65 mm ( 1 to 3 in ) , depending on location , the city cannot be classified as solely Mediterranean or humid subtropical . Due to its size , diverse topography , maritime location and most importantly having a coastline to two different bodies of water to the north and south , Istanbul exhibits microclimates . The northern half of the city , as well as the Bosporus coastline , express characteristics of oceanic and humid subtropical climates , because of humidity from the Black Sea and the relatively high concentration of vegetation . The climate in the populated areas of the city to the south , located on the Sea of Marmara , is warmer , drier and less affected by humidity . The annual precipitation in the northern half can be twice as much ( <unk> , 1166 @.@ 6 mm ) , than it is in the southern , Marmara coast ( <unk> 635 @.@ 0 mm ) . There is a significant difference between annual mean temperatures on the north and south coasts as well , <unk> 12 @.@ 8 ° C ( 55 @.@ 0 ° F ) , <unk> 15 @.@ 03 ° C ( 59 @.@ 05 ° F ) . Parts of the province , that are away from both seas exhibit considerable continental influences , with much more pronounced night @-@ day and summer @-@ winter temperature differences . In winter some parts of the province average freezing or below at night . 
 Istanbul 's persistently high humidity reaches 80 percent most mornings . Because of this , fog is very common , although more so in northern parts of the city and away from the city center . Dense fog disrupts transportation in the region , including on the Bosphorus , and is common during the autumn and winter months when the humidity remains high into the afternoon . The humid conditions and the fog tend to dissipate by midday during the summer months , but the lingering humidity exacerbates the moderately high summer temperatures . During these summer months , high temperatures average around 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) and rainfall is uncommon ; there are only about fifteen days with measurable precipitation between June and August . The summer months also have the highest concentration of thunderstorms . 
 Winter is colder in Istanbul than in most other cities around the Mediterranean Basin , with low temperatures averaging 1 – 4 ° C ( 34 – 39 ° F ) . Lake @-@ effect snow from the Black Sea is common , although difficult to forecast , with the potential to be heavy and — as with the fog — disruptive to the city 's infrastructure . Spring and autumn are mild , but often wet and unpredictable ; chilly winds from the northwest and warm gusts from the south — sometimes in the same day — tend to cause fluctuations in temperature . Overall , Istanbul has an annual average of 130 days with significant precipitation , which amounts to 810 millimeters ( 31 @.@ 9 in ) per year . The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city center on the Marmara coast are 40 @.@ 5 ° C ( 105 ° F ) and − 16 @.@ 1 ° C ( 3 ° F ) . The greatest rainfall recorded in a day is 227 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) , and the highest recorded snow cover is 80 centimeters ( 31 in ) .

 The Fatih district corresponds to what was , until the Ottoman conquest , the whole of the city , across from the Genoese citadel of Galata . Those Genoese fortifications were largely demolished in the 19th century , leaving only the Galata Tower , to make way for northward expansion of the city . Galata is now part of the Beyoğlu district , which forms Istanbul 's commercial and entertainment center on Taksim Square . 
 Dolmabahçe Palace , the seat of government during the late Ottoman period , is located in Beşiktaş , just south of Beyoğlu , across from BJK İnönü Stadium , home to Turkey 's oldest sports club . The main administration building of the Ottoman Empire was the " Sublime Porte " or <unk> a huge building in the old City . The former village of Ortaköy is situated within Beşiktaş and gives its name to the Ortaköy Mosque , along the Bosphorus near the First Bosphorus Bridge . Lining the shores of the Bosphorus north of there are <unk> , luxurious chalet mansions originally built by 19th @-@ century aristocrats and elites as summer homes . Farther inland , outside the city 's inner ring road , are Levent and <unk> , Istanbul 's primary economic centers . 
 During the Ottoman period , Üsküdar and Kadıköy were outside the scope of urban Istanbul , serving as tranquil outposts with seaside <unk> and gardens . During the second half of the 20th century , the Asian side experienced major urban growth ; the late development of this part of the city led to better infrastructure and <unk> urban planning when compared with most other residential areas in the city . Much of the Asian side of the Bosphorus functions as a suburb of the economic and commercial centers in European Istanbul , accounting for a third of the city 's population but only a quarter of its employment . As a result of Istanbul 's exponential growth during the 20th century , a significant portion of the city is composed of <unk> ( literally " built overnight " ) , referring to illegally constructed squatter buildings . At present , some <unk> areas are being gradually demolished and replaced by modern mass @-@ housing compounds . Moreover , large scale gentrification and urban renewal projects have been taking place , such as the one in <unk> ; some of these projects , like the one in <unk> , have faced criticism . The Turkish government also has ambitious plans for an expansion of the city west and northwards on the European side in conjunction with plans for a third airport and the city 's Olympic bid ; the new parts of the city will include four different settlements with specified urban functions , housing 1 @.@ 5 million people . 
 Istanbul does not have a primary urban park , but it does have several green areas . Gülhane Park and Yıldız Park were originally included within the grounds of two of Istanbul 's palaces — Topkapı Palace and Yıldız Palace — but they were repurposed as public parks in the early decades of the Turkish Republic . Another park , <unk> Paşa <unk> , is situated on a hillside adjacent to the Bosphorus Bridge in Anatolia , opposite Yıldız Palace . Along the European side , and closer to the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge , is <unk> Park ; originally a private estate belonging to Ottoman leaders , the 47 @-@ hectare ( 120 @-@ acre ) park is known for its diversity of plants and an annual tulip festival held since 2005 . Popular during the summer among Istanbulites is Belgrad Forest , spreading across 5 @,@ 500 hectares ( 14 @,@ 000 acres ) at the northern edge of the city . The forest originally supplied water to the city and remnants of reservoirs used during Byzantine and Ottoman times survive . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 Istanbul is primarily known for its Byzantine and Ottoman architecture , but its buildings reflect the various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city . Examples of Genoese and Roman architecture remain visible in Istanbul alongside their Ottoman counterparts . Nothing of the architecture of the classical Greek period has survived , but Roman architecture has proved to be more durable . The obelisk erected by Theodosius in the Hippodrome of Constantinople is still visible in Sultanahmet Square , and a section of the Valens Aqueduct , constructed in the late 4th century , stands relatively intact at the western edge of the Fatih district . The Column of Constantine , erected in 330 CE to mark the new Roman capital , stands not far from the Hippodrome . 
 Early Byzantine architecture followed the classical Roman model of domes and arches , but improved upon these elements , as in the Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus . The oldest surviving Byzantine church in Istanbul — albeit in ruins — is the Monastery of Stoudios ( later converted into the <unk> Mosque ) , which was built in 454 . After the recapture of Constantinople in 1261 , the Byzantines enlarged two of the most important churches extant , Chora Church and <unk> Church . The pinnacle of Byzantine architecture , and one of Istanbul 's most iconic structures , is the Hagia Sophia . <unk> by a dome 31 meters ( 102 ft ) in diameter , the Hagia Sophia stood as the world 's largest cathedral for centuries , and was later converted into a mosque and , as it stands now , a museum . 
 Among the oldest surviving examples of Ottoman architecture in Istanbul are the Anadoluhisarı and Rumelihisarı fortresses , which assisted the Ottomans during their siege of the city . Over the next four centuries , the Ottomans made an indelible impression on the skyline of Istanbul , building towering mosques and ornate palaces . The largest palace , Topkapı , includes a diverse array of architectural styles , from Baroque inside the Harem , to its Neoclassical style <unk> Library . The imperial mosques include Fatih Mosque , Bayezid Mosque , Yavuz Selim Mosque , Süleymaniye Mosque , Sultan Ahmed Mosque ( the Blue Mosque ) , and Yeni Mosque , all of which were built at the peak of the Ottoman Empire , in the 16th and 17th centuries . In the following centuries , and especially after the Tanzimat reforms , Ottoman architecture was supplanted by European styles . An example of which is the imperial <unk> Mosque . Areas around İstiklal Avenue were filled with grand European embassies and rows of buildings in Neoclassical , Renaissance Revival and Art Nouveau styles , which went on to influence the architecture of a variety of structures in Beyoğlu — including churches , stores , and theaters — and official buildings such as Dolmabahçe Palace . 
 = = Administration = = 
 Since 2004 , the municipal boundaries of Istanbul have been coincident with the boundaries of its province . The city , considered capital of Istanbul Province , is administered by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality ( MMI ) , which oversees the 39 districts of the city @-@ province . 
 The current city structure can be traced back to the Tanzimat period of reform in the 19th century , before which Islamic judges and imams led the city under the auspices of the Grand Vizier . Following the model of French cities , this religious system was replaced by a mayor and a citywide council composed of representatives of the confessional groups ( millet ) across Istanbul . Beyoğlu was the first area of the city to have its own director and council , with members instead being longtime residents of the neighborhood . Laws enacted after the Ottoman constitution of 1876 aimed to expand this structure across the city , imitating the twenty arrondissements of Paris , but they were not fully implemented until 1908 , when Istanbul was declared a province with nine constituent districts . This system continued beyond the founding of the Turkish Republic , with the province renamed a <unk> ( municipality ) , but the municipality was disbanded in 1957 . 
 Small settlements adjacent to major population centers in Turkey , including Istanbul , were merged into their respective primary cities during the early 1980s , resulting in metropolitan municipalities . The main decision @-@ making body of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality is the Municipal Council , with members drawn from district councils . 
 The Municipal Council is responsible for citywide issues , including managing the budget , maintaining civic infrastructure , and overseeing museums and major cultural centers . Since the government operates under a " powerful mayor , weak council " approach , the council 's leader — the metropolitan mayor — has the authority to make swift decisions , often at the expense of transparency . The Municipal Council is advised by the Metropolitan Executive Committee , although the Committee also has limited power to make decisions of its own . All representatives on the Committee are appointed by the metropolitan mayor and the Council , with the mayor — or someone of his or her choosing — serving as head . 
 District councils are chiefly responsible for waste management and construction projects within their respective districts . They each maintain their own budgets , although the metropolitan mayor reserves the right to review district decisions . One @-@ fifth of all district council members , including the district mayors , also represent their districts in the Municipal Council . All members of the district councils and the Municipal Council , including the metropolitan mayor , are elected to five @-@ year terms . Representing the Justice and Development Party , Kadir Topbaş has been Mayor of Istanbul since March 2004 . 
 With the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Istanbul Province having equivalent jurisdictions , few responsibilities remain for the provincial government . Similar to the MMI , the Istanbul Special Provincial Administration has a governor , a democratically elected decision @-@ making body — the Provincial Parliament — and an appointed Executive Committee . Mirroring the executive committee at the municipal level , the Provincial Executive Committee includes a secretary @-@ general and leaders of departments that advise the Provincial Parliament . The Provincial Administration 's duties are largely limited to the building and maintenance of schools , residences , government buildings , and roads , and the promotion of arts , culture , and nature conservation . Hüseyin Avni <unk> has been Governor of Istanbul Province since May 2010 .

 Throughout most of its history , Istanbul has ranked among the largest cities in the world . By 500 CE , Constantinople had somewhere between 400 @,@ 000 and 500 @,@ 000 people , edging out its predecessor , Rome , for world 's largest city . Constantinople jostled with other major historical cities , such as Baghdad , Chang 'an , Kaifeng and Merv for the position of world 's most populous city until the 12th century . It never returned to being the world 's largest , but remained Europe 's largest city from 1500 to 1750 , when it was surpassed by London . 
 The Turkish Statistical Institute estimates that the population of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality was 14 @,@ 377 @,@ 019 at the end of 2014 , hosting 19 percent of the country 's population . Other estimate that at the same time the population within city limits was 14 @,@ 657 @,@ 434 . Then about 97 – 98 % of the inhabitants of the metropolitan municipality were within city limits , up from 89 % in 2007 and 61 % in 1980 . 64 @.@ 7 % of the residents live on the European side and 35 @.@ 3 % on the Asian side . While the city ranks as world 's 7th @-@ largest city proper , it drops the rank to the 24th place as an urban area and to the 18th place as a metro area because the city limits are roughly equivalent to the agglomeration . Today , it forms one of the largest urban agglomerations in Europe , alongside Moscow . The city 's annual population growth of 3 @.@ 45 percent ranks as the highest among the seventy @-@ eight largest metropolises in the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development . The high population growth mirrors an urbanization trend across the country , as the second and third fastest @-@ growing OECD metropolises are the Turkish cities of İzmir and Ankara . 
 Istanbul experienced especially rapid growth during the second half of the 20th century , with its population increasing tenfold between 1950 and 2000 . This growth in population comes , in part , from an expansion of city limits — particularly between 1980 and 1985 , when the number of Istanbulites nearly doubled . The remarkable growth was , and still is , largely fueled by migrants from eastern Turkey seeking employment and improved living conditions . The number of residents of Istanbul originating from seven northern and eastern provinces is greater than the populations of their entire respective provinces ; Sivas and Kastamonu each account for more than half a million residents of Istanbul . Istanbul 's foreign population , by comparison , is very small , 42 @,@ 228 residents in 2007 . Only 28 percent of the city 's residents are originally from Istanbul . The most densely populated areas tend to lie to the northwest , west , and southwest of the city center , on the European side ; the most densely populated district on the Asian side is Üsküdar . 
 = = = Religious and ethnic groups = = = 
 Istanbul has been a cosmopolitan city throughout much of its history , but it has become more homogenized since the end of the Ottoman Empire . Most of Turkey 's religious and ethnic minorities remain concentrated in Istanbul . The vast majority of people across Turkey , and in Istanbul , are Muslim , and more specifically members of the Sunni branch of Islam . Most Sunnis follow the Hanafi school of Islamic thought , although approximately 10 percent of Sunnis follow the Shafi 'i school . The largest non @-@ Sunni Muslim sect , accounting for 4 @.@ 5 million Turks , is the Alevis ; a third of all Alevis in the country live in Istanbul . Mystic movements , like Sufism , were officially banned after the establishment of the Turkish Republic , but they still boast numerous followers . 
 The Patriarch of Constantinople has been designated Ecumenical Patriarch since the sixth century , and has subsequently come to be widely regarded as the leader of the world 's 300 million Orthodox Christians . Since 1601 , the Patriarchate has been based in Istanbul 's Church of St. George . Into the 19th century , the Christians of Istanbul tended to be either Greek Orthodox or members of the Armenian Apostolic Church . The headquarters of the Turkish Orthodox Church are located in the city . Because of events during the 20th century — including the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey , a 1942 wealth tax , and the 1955 Istanbul riots — the Greek population , originally centered in <unk> and <unk> , has decreased substantially . At the start of the 21st century , Istanbul 's Greek population numbered 3 @,@ 000 ( down from 130 @,@ 000 in 1923 and 260 @,@ 000 according to the Ottoman Census of 1910 of 850 @,@ 000 total ) . There are today between 50 @,@ 000 and 70 @,@ 000 Armenians in Istanbul , down from 164 @,@ 000 in 1913 partly due to the Armenian Genocide . Christians made up half the population of the city in 1910 . 
 The largest ethnic minority in Istanbul is the Kurdish community , originating from eastern and southeastern Turkey . Although the Kurdish presence in the city dates back to the early Ottoman period , the influx of Kurds into the city has accelerated since the beginning of the Kurdish – Turkish conflict with the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( i.e. since the late 1970s ) . About two to three million residents of Istanbul are Kurdish , meaning there are more Kurds in Istanbul than in any other city in the world . There are other significant ethnic minorities as well , the Bosniaks are the main people of an entire district – <unk> . The neighborhood of Balat used to be home to a sizable Sephardi Jewish community , first formed during the period of the Spanish Inquisition . Romaniotes and Ashkenazi Jews resided in Istanbul even before the Sephardim , but their proportion has since dwindled ; today , 1 percent of Istanbul 's Jews are Ashkenazi . In large part due to emigration to Israel , the Jewish population nationwide dropped from 100 @,@ 000 in 1950 to 18 @,@ 000 in 2005 , with the majority of them living in either Istanbul or İzmir . <unk> , Latin Christians who settled in Galata during the Ottoman period , played a seminal role in shaping the culture and architecture of Istanbul during the 19th and early 20th centuries ; their population has dwindled , but they remain in the city in small numbers . From the increase in mutual cooperation between Turkey and several African States like Somalia and Djibouti , several young students and workers have been migrating to Istanbul in search of better education and employment opportunities . There is also a small Nigerian , Congolese and Cameroonian and North African community present . 
 = = Politics = = 
 Istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995 . Since 2002 , the right @-@ wing Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) has won <unk> in every general and local election . The city 's electorate has also voted for the AKP government 's constitutional reforms proposed during the 2007 and 2010 constitutional referenda . Turkish President and former AKP Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected Mayor of İstanbul in the 1994 local elections as the Islamist Welfare Party candidate with 25 @.@ 1 % of the vote , winning due to a vote split between the mainstream centrist parties . Conservative parties traditionally find support in older districts with high population densities such as <unk> , Fatih , <unk> and <unk> . The opposition Kemalist center @-@ left Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) , currently the second major political force in both İstanbul and the country , gets most of its support from more rural districts such as Silivri , Çatalca and <unk> . Urban districts such as Beşiktaş , <unk> , <unk> and Kadıköy have returned strong support for the CHP in past elections . The CHP are generally strongest in the west , where newer residential developments are taking place . İstanbul has 39 districts , more than any other province in Turkey . Since İstanbul is Turkey 's largest city and has usually voted in the same way as the country as a whole , it is largely perceived in Turkish politics that the winning party of an election is essentially decided by İstanbul 's electorate . Political parties thus allocate substantial amounts of electoral campaign funds and to winning control of the İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality . Due to its electoral importance , İstanbul has reported the largest and most serious cases of electoral fraud in recent elections , including the 2014 local elections . 
 The incumbent mayor of the city is Kadir Topbaş of the AKP , who was first elected in the 2004 local elections and succeeded Ali <unk> <unk> of the closed down Welfare Party . He was re @-@ elected in 2009 and 2014 . The leader of the CHP and parliamentary opposition , Kemal <unk> , ran against Topbaş in the 2009 local elections . He is currently a Member of Parliament for İstanbul . Between 2007 and 2014 , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was also an MP for İstanbul . For general elections , the city is divided into 3 electoral districts and returns 85 MPs to the Turkish parliament . In the 2014 presidential election , 49 @.@ 83 % of the city 's electorate voted for AKP candidate Recep Tayyip Erdoğan . Although Erdoğan won the most votes in İstanbul , his failure to win above 50 % was seen as significant . Opposition candidate Ekmeleddin <unk> came second with 41 @.@ 08 % and the HDP pro @-@ Kurdish and left @-@ wing candidate <unk> <unk> won a substantial 9 @.@ 09 % . In 2013 and 2014 , large @-@ scale anti @-@ AKP government protests began in İstanbul and spread throughout the nation .

 With a PPP @-@ adjusted gross domestic product of US $ 301 @.@ 1 billion , Istanbul ranked 29th among the world 's urban areas in 2011 . Since the mid @-@ 1990s , Istanbul 's economy has been one of the fastest @-@ growing among OECD metro @-@ regions . Istanbul is responsible for 27 percent of Turkey 's GDP , with 20 percent of the country 's industrial labor force residing in the city . Its GDP per capita and productivity are greater than their national averages by 70 percent and 50 percent , respectively , owing in part to the focus on high @-@ value @-@ added activities . With its high population and significant contribution to the Turkish economy , Istanbul is responsible for two @-@ fifths of the nation 's tax revenue . That includes the taxes of 37 US @-@ dollar billionaires based in Istanbul , the fifth @-@ highest number among cities around the world . 
 As expected for a city of its size , Istanbul has a diverse industrial economy , producing commodities as varied as olive oil , tobacco , vehicles , and electronics . Despite having a focus on high @-@ value @-@ added work , its low @-@ value @-@ added manufacturing sector is substantial , representing just 26 percent of Istanbul 's GDP , but four @-@ fifths of the city 's total exports . In 2005 , companies based in Istanbul produced exports worth $ 41 @.@ 4 billion and received imports totaling $ 69 @.@ 9 billion ; these figures were equivalent to 57 percent and 60 percent , respectively , of the national totals . 
 Istanbul is home to Borsa Istanbul , the sole exchange entity of Turkey , which combined the former Istanbul Stock Exchange , the Istanbul Gold Exchange , and the Derivatives Exchange of Turkey . The former Istanbul Stock Exchange was originally established as the Ottoman Stock Exchange in 1866 . During the 19th and early 20th centuries , <unk> Caddesi ( Banks Street ) in Galata was the financial center of the Ottoman Empire , where the Ottoman Stock Exchange was located . <unk> Caddesi continued to be Istanbul 's main financial district until the 1990s , when most Turkish banks began moving their headquarters to the modern central business districts of Levent and <unk> . In 1995 , the Istanbul Stock Exchange ( now Borsa Istanbul ) moved to its current building in the İstinye quarter of the <unk> district . A new central business district is also under construction in <unk> and will host the headquarters of various Turkish banks and financial institutions upon completion . 
 As the only sea route between the oil @-@ rich Black Sea and the Mediterranean , the Bosphorus is one of the busiest waterways in the world ; more than 200 million tonnes of oil pass through the strait each year , and the traffic on the Bosphorus is three times that on the Suez Canal . As a result , there have been proposals to build a canal , known as Canal Istanbul , parallel to the strait , on the European side of the city . Istanbul has three major shipping ports — the Port of Haydarpaşa , the Port of Ambarlı , and the Port of <unk> — as well as several smaller ports and oil terminals along the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara . Haydarpaşa , situated at the southeastern end of the Bosphorus , was Istanbul 's largest port until the early 2000s . Shifts in operations to Ambarlı since then have left Haydarpaşa running under capacity and with plans to decommission the port . In 2007 , Ambarlı , on the western edge of the urban center , had an annual capacity of 1 @.@ 5 million TEUs ( compared to 354 @,@ 000 TEUs at Haydarpaşa ) , making it the fourth @-@ largest cargo terminal in the Mediterranean basin . The Port of <unk> is advantaged by its proximity to motorways and Atatürk International Airport , and long @-@ term plans for the city call for greater connectivity between all terminals and the road and rail networks . 
 Istanbul is an increasingly popular tourist destination ; whereas just 2 @.@ 4 million foreigners visited the city in 2000 , it welcomed 12 @.@ 56 million foreign tourists in 2015 , making it the world 's fifth most @-@ visited city . Istanbul is Turkey 's second @-@ largest international gateway , after Antalya , receiving a quarter of the nation 's foreign tourists . Istanbul 's tourist industry is concentrated in the European side , with 90 percent of the city 's hotels located there . <unk> and mid @-@ range hotels tend to be located on the Sarayburnu ; higher @-@ end hotels are primarily located in the entertainment and financial centers north of the Golden Horn . Istanbul 's seventy museums , the most visited of which are the Topkapı Palace Museum and the Hagia Sophia , bring in $ 30 million in revenue each year . The city 's environmental master plan also notes that there are 17 palaces , 64 mosques , and 49 churches of historical significance in Istanbul .

 Istanbul was historically known as a cultural hub , but its cultural scene stagnated after the Turkish Republic shifted its focus toward Ankara . The new national government established programs that served to orient Turks toward musical traditions , especially those originating in Europe , but musical institutions and visits by foreign classical artists were primarily centered in the new capital . Much of Turkey 's cultural scene had its roots in Istanbul , and by the 1980s and 1990s Istanbul reemerged globally as a city whose cultural significance is not solely based on its past glory . 
 By the end of the 19th century , Istanbul had established itself as a regional artistic center , with Turkish , European , and Middle Eastern artists flocking to the city . Despite efforts to make Ankara Turkey 's cultural heart , Istanbul had the country 's primary institution of art until the 1970s . When additional universities and art journals were founded in Istanbul during the 1980s , artists formerly based in Ankara moved in . Beyoğlu has been transformed into the artistic center of the city , with young artists and older Turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there . Modern art museums , including İstanbul Modern , the Pera Museum , <unk> Sabancı Museum and <unk> , opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and auction houses that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city . These museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on the historic peninsula , including the Istanbul Archaeology Museums , which ushered in the era of modern museums in Turkey , and the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum . 
 The first film screening in Turkey was at Yıldız Palace in 1896 , a year after the technology publicly debuted in Paris . Movie theaters rapidly cropped up in Beyoğlu , with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as İstiklal Avenue . Istanbul also became the heart of Turkey 's nascent film industry , although Turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s . Since then , Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies . The Turkish film industry ramped up in the second half of the century , and with <unk> ( 2002 ) and My Father and My Son ( 2005 ) , both filmed in Istanbul , the nation 's movies began to see substantial international success . Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films , including Topkapi ( 1964 ) , The World Is Not Enough ( 1999 ) , and Mission <unk> ( 2008 ) . 
 Coinciding with this cultural reemergence was the establishment of the Istanbul Festival , which began showcasing a variety of art from Turkey and around the world in 1973 . From this flagship festival came the International Istanbul Film Festival and the Istanbul International Jazz Festival in the early 1980s . With its focus now solely on music and dance , the Istanbul Festival has been known as the Istanbul International Music Festival since 1994 . The most prominent of the festivals that evolved from the original Istanbul Festival is the Istanbul Biennial , held every two years since 1987 . Its early incarnations were aimed at showcasing Turkish visual art , and it has since opened to international artists and risen in prestige to join the elite <unk> , alongside the Venice Biennale and the São Paulo Art Biennial .

 Istanbul has numerous shopping centers , from the historic to the modern . The Grand Bazaar , in operation since 1461 , is among the world 's oldest and largest covered markets . <unk> Bazaar is an open @-@ air market extending between the Grand Bazaar and the Egyptian Bazaar , which has been Istanbul 's major spice market since 1660 . Galleria <unk> ushered in the age of modern shopping malls in Turkey when it opened in 1987 . Since then , malls have become major shopping centers outside the historic peninsula . <unk> was awarded the titles of " Europe 's best " and " World 's best " shopping mall by the International Council of Shopping Centers in 1995 and 1996 ; Istanbul <unk> has been one of the continent 's largest since opening in 2005 ; Kanyon won the Cityscape Architectural Review Award in the Commercial Built category in 2006 . İstinye Park in İstinye and <unk> Center near Levent are among the newest malls which include the stores of the world 's top fashion brands . Abdi İpekçi Street in <unk> and <unk> Avenue on the Anatolian side of the city have evolved into high @-@ end shopping districts . 
 Istanbul is famous for its historic seafood restaurants . Many of the city 's most popular and upscale seafood restaurants line the shores of the Bosphorus ( particularly in neighborhoods like Ortaköy , Bebek , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) . <unk> along the Sea of Marmara has a pedestrian zone that hosts around fifty fish restaurants . The Prince Islands , 15 kilometers ( 9 mi ) from the city center , are also popular for their seafood restaurants . Because of their restaurants , historic summer mansions , and tranquil , car @-@ free streets , the Prince Islands are a popular vacation destination among Istanbulites and foreign tourists . Istanbul is also famous for its sophisticated and elaborately @-@ cooked dishes of the Ottoman cuisine . However , following the influx of immigrants from southeastern and eastern Turkey , which began in the 1960s , the <unk> of the city has drastically changed by the end of the century ; with influences of Middle Eastern cuisine such as kebab taking an important place in the food scene . Restaurants featuring foreign cuisines are mainly concentrated in the Beyoğlu , Beşiktaş , <unk> and Kadıköy districts . 
 Istanbul is famous for its nightlife , as well as its historic taverns , a signature characteristic of the city for centuries if not millennia . Along the İstiklal Avenue is the <unk> <unk> , now home to winehouses ( known as <unk> ) , pubs , and restaurants . İstiklal Avenue , originally famous for its taverns , has shifted toward shopping , but the nearby <unk> Street is still lined with winehouses and pubs . Some other neighborhoods around İstiklal Avenue have recently been revamped to cater to Beyoğlu 's nightlife , with formerly commercial streets now lined with pubs , cafes , and restaurants playing live music . Other focal points for Istanbul 's nightlife include <unk> , Ortaköy , Bebek , and Kadıköy . 
 = = Sports = = 
 Istanbul has some of Turkey 's oldest sports clubs . Beşiktaş J.K. , established in 1903 , is considered the oldest of these sports clubs . Due to its initial status as Turkey 's only club , Beşiktaş occasionally represented the Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic in international sports competitions , earning the right to place the Turkish flag inside its team logo . Its football team has seen several periods of dominance in national competition . Galatasaray S.K. and Fenerbahçe S.K. have fared better in international competition and share the honor of winning the most Süper Lig championships : 20 and 19 times , respectively . Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe have a long @-@ standing rivalry , with Galatasaray based in the European part and Fenerbahçe based in the Anatolian part of the city . Istanbul has seven basketball teams — Anadolu Efes , Beşiktaş , Darüşşafaka , Fenerbahçe , Galatasaray , İstanbul Büyükşehir Belediyespor and Büyükçekmece — that play in the premier @-@ level Turkish Basketball Super League . 
 Many of Istanbul 's sports facilities have been built or upgraded since 2000 to bolster the city 's bids for the Summer Olympic Games . Atatürk Olympic Stadium , the largest multi @-@ purpose stadium in Turkey , was completed in 2002 as an IAAF first @-@ class venue for track and field . The stadium hosted the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final . <unk> <unk> Stadium , Fenerbahçe 's home field , hosted the 2009 UEFA Cup Final three years after its completion . Türk Telekom Arena opened in 2011 to replace Ali Sami Yen Stadium as Galatasaray 's home turf , while Vodafone Arena opened in 2016 to replace BJK İnönü Stadium as the home turf of Beşiktaş , which won the Süper Lig in the same season . All four stadiums are elite Category 4 ( formerly five @-@ star ) UEFA stadiums . 
 The Sinan Erdem Dome , among the largest indoor arenas in Europe , hosted the final of the 2010 FIBA World Championship , the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships , and the 2011 – 12 Euroleague Final Four . Prior to the completion of the Sinan Erdem Dome in 2010 , Abdi İpekçi Arena was Istanbul 's primary indoor arena , having hosted the finals of EuroBasket 2001 . Several other indoor arenas , including the Beşiktaş <unk> Arena , have also been inaugurated since 2000 , serving as the home courts of Istanbul 's sports clubs . The most recent of these is the 13 @,@ 800 @-@ seat <unk> Sports Arena , which opened in 2012 as the home court of Fenerbahçe 's basketball teams . Despite the construction boom , five bids for the Summer Olympics — in 2000 , 2004 , 2008 , 2012 , and 2020 — and national bids for UEFA Euro 2012 and UEFA Euro 2016 have ended unsuccessfully . 
 Istanbul Park was a stop on the World Touring Car Championship circuit and the European Le Mans Series in 2005 and 2006 , but the track has not seen either of these competitions since then . Between its opening in 2005 and 2011 , Istanbul Park also hosted the annual Turkish Grand Prix ; its future remains uncertain due to financial troubles . The Istanbul Sailing Club , established in 1952 , hosts races , showcases , and events on the waterways in and around Istanbul each year . The Turkish Offshore Racing Club also hosts major races , with its most prestigious being its race for the Marine Forces Trophy . Istanbul was also an occasional stop on the F1 Powerboat World Championship circuit , although its last appearance on the Bosphorus was in 2000 . 
 = = Media = = 
 Most state @-@ run radio and television stations are based in Ankara , but Istanbul is the primary hub of Turkish media . The industry has its roots in the former Ottoman capital , where the first Turkish newspaper , <unk> @-@ i <unk> ( Calendar of Affairs ) , was published in 1831 . The <unk> street on which the newspaper was printed , <unk> @-@ ı <unk> Street , rapidly became the center of Turkish print media , alongside Beyoğlu across the Golden Horn . 
 Today , Istanbul hosts a wide variety of periodicals . Most nationwide newspapers are based in Istanbul , with simultaneous Ankara and İzmir editions . Istanbul @-@ based Zaman , although only founded in 1986 , is Turkey 's most widely circulated paper , with a weekly distribution of more than one million , twice that of its nearest competitor . Posta , Hürriyet , and <unk> , which round out the country 's top four papers , are all headquartered in Istanbul , boasting more than 300 @,@ 000 weekly sales each . Hürriyet 's English @-@ language edition , The Hürriyet Daily News , has been printed since 1961 , but the English @-@ language Today 's Zaman , first published by Zaman in 2007 , has overtaken it in circulation . Several smaller newspapers , including popular publications like Habertürk and <unk> , are also based in Istanbul . 
 Radio broadcasts in Istanbul date back to 1927 , when Turkey 's first radio transmission came from atop the Central Post Office in <unk> . Control of this transmission , and other radio stations established in the following decades , ultimately came under the state @-@ run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation ( TRT ) , which held a monopoly on radio and television broadcasts between its founding in 1964 and 1990 . Today , TRT runs four national radio stations ; these stations have transmitters across the country so each can reach over 90 percent of the country 's population , but only Radio 2 is based in Istanbul . Offering a range of content from educational programming to coverage of sporting events , Radio 2 is the most popular radio station in Turkey . Istanbul 's airwaves are the busiest in Turkey , primarily featuring either Turkish @-@ language or English @-@ language content . One of the exceptions , offering both , is <unk> Radyo ( 94 @.@ 9 FM ) . Among Turkey 's first private stations , and the first featuring foreign popular music , was Istanbul 's Metro FM ( 97 @.@ 2 FM ) . The state @-@ run Radio 3 , although based in Ankara , also features English @-@ language popular music , and English @-@ language news programming is provided on NTV Radyo ( 102 @.@ 8 FM ) . 
 TRT @-@ Children is the only TRT television station based in Istanbul . Istanbul is home to the headquarters of several Turkish stations and regional headquarters of international media outlets . Istanbul @-@ based Star TV was the first private television network to be established following the end of the TRT monopoly ; Star TV and Show TV ( also based in Istanbul ) remain highly popular throughout the country , airing Turkish and American series . <unk> TV , Kanal D , and ATV are other stations in Istanbul that offer a mix of news and series ; NTV ( partnered with U.S. media outlet MSNBC ) and Sky Turk — both based in the city — are mainly just known for their news coverage in Turkish . The BBC has a regional office in Istanbul , assisting its Turkish @-@ language news operations , and the American news channel CNN established the Turkish @-@ language CNN Türk there in 1999 . The Istanbul @-@ based business and entertainment channel CNBC @-@ e began broadcasting in 2000 . 
 = = Education = = 
 Istanbul University , founded in 1453 , is the oldest Turkish educational institution in the city . Although originally an Islamic school , the university established law , medicine , and science departments in the 19th century and was secularized after the founding of the Turkish Republic . Istanbul Technical University , founded in 1773 , is the world 's third @-@ oldest university dedicated entirely to engineering sciences . These public universities are two of just eight across the city ; other prominent state universities in Istanbul include the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University , which served as Turkey 's primary institution of art until the 1970s , and Marmara University , the country 's third @-@ largest institution of higher learning . 
 Most established universities in Istanbul are backed by the government ; the city also has several prominent private institutions . The first modern private university in Istanbul , also the oldest American school in existence in its original location outside the United States , was Robert College , founded by Christopher Robert , an American philanthropist , and Cyrus Hamlin , a missionary devoted to education , in 1863 . The tertiary element of its education program became the public Boğaziçi University in 1971 ; the remaining portion in <unk> continues as a boarding high @-@ school under the name Robert College . Private universities were officially outlawed in Turkey before the Constitution of 1982 , but there were already fifteen private " higher schools " , which were effectively universities , in Istanbul by 1970 . The first private university established in Istanbul since 1982 was Koç University ( founded in 1992 ) , and another dozen had opened within the following decade . Today , there are at least 30 private universities in the city , including Istanbul Commerce University and Kadir Has University . A new biomedical research and development hub , called Bio Istanbul , is under construction in <unk> , and will host 15 @,@ 000 residents , 20 @,@ 000 working commuters , and a university upon completion . 
 In 2007 , there were about 4 @,@ 350 schools , about half of which were primary schools ; on average , each school had 688 students . In recent years , Istanbul 's educational system has expanded substantially ; from 2000 to 2007 , the number of classrooms and teachers nearly doubled and the number of students increased by more than 60 percent . Galatasaray High School , established in 1481 as the Galata Palace Imperial School , is the oldest high school in Istanbul and the second @-@ oldest educational institution in the city . It was built at the behest of Sultan Bayezid II , who sought to bring students with diverse backgrounds together as a means of strengthening his growing empire . It is one of Turkey 's Anatolian High Schools , elite public high schools that place a stronger emphasis on instruction in foreign languages . Galatasaray , for example , offers instruction in French ; other Anatolian High Schools primarily teach in English or German alongside Turkish . The city also has foreign high schools , such as Liceo Italiano , that were established in the 19th century to educate foreigners . 
 <unk> Military High School , along the shores of the Bosphorus in <unk> , and Turkish Naval High School , located on one of the Princes ' Islands , are military high schools , complemented by three military academies — the Turkish Air Force , Turkish Military , and Turkish Naval Academies . Darüşşafaka High School provides free education to children across the country missing at least one parent . Darüşşafaka begins instruction with the fourth grade , providing instruction in English and , starting in sixth grade , a second foreign language — German or French . Other prominent high schools in the city include <unk> <unk> <unk> ( founded in 1908 ) and Kadıköy Anadolu <unk> ( founded in 1955 ) .

 Istanbul 's first water supply systems date back to the city 's early history , when aqueducts ( such as the Valens Aqueduct ) deposited the water in the city 's numerous cisterns . At the behest of Suleiman the Magnificent , the <unk> water supply network was constructed ; by 1563 , the network provided 4 @,@ 200 cubic meters ( 150 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of water to 158 sites each day . In later years , in response to increasing public demand , water from various springs was channeled to public fountains , like the Fountain of Ahmed III , by means of supply lines . Today , Istanbul has a chlorinated and filtered water supply and a sewage treatment system managed by the Istanbul Water and Sewerage Administration ( <unk> ) . 
 The <unk> Power Station , a coal @-@ fired power plant along the Golden Horn , was the sole source of Istanbul 's electricity between 1914 , when its first engine room was completed , and 1952 . Following the founding of the Turkish Republic , the plant underwent renovations to accommodate the city 's increasing demand ; its capacity grew from 23 megawatts in 1923 to a peak of 120 megawatts in 1956 . Capacity declined until the power station reached the end of its economic life and shut down in 1983 . The state @-@ run Turkish Electrical Authority ( TEK ) briefly — between its founding in 1970 and 1984 — held a monopoly on the generation and distribution of electricity , but now the authority — since split between the Turkish Electricity Generation Transmission Company ( <unk> ) and the Turkish Electricity Distribution Company ( <unk> ) — competes with private electric utilities . 
 The Ottoman Ministry of Post and Telegraph was established in 1840 and the first post office , the Imperial Post Office , opened near the courtyard of Yeni Mosque . By 1876 , the first international mailing network between Istanbul and the lands beyond the Ottoman Empire had been established . Sultan Abdülmecid I issued Samuel Morse his first official honor for the telegraph in 1847 , and construction of the first telegraph line — between Istanbul and Edirne — finished in time to announce the end of the Crimean War in 1856 . A nascent telephone system began to emerge in Istanbul in 1881 and after the first manual telephone exchange became operational in Istanbul in 1909 , the Ministry of Post and Telegraph became the Ministry of Post , Telegraph , and Telephone . GSM cellular networks arrived in Turkey in 1994 , with Istanbul among the first cities to receive the service . Today , mobile and landline service is provided by private companies , after Türk Telekom , which split from the Ministry of Post , Telegraph , and Telephone in 1995 , was privatized in 2005 . Postal services remain under the purview of what is now the Post and Telegraph Organization ( retaining the acronym PTT ) . 
 In 2000 , Istanbul had 137 hospitals , of which 100 were private . Turkish citizens are entitled to subsidized healthcare in the nation 's state @-@ run hospitals . As public hospitals tend to be overcrowded or otherwise slow , private hospitals are preferable for those who can afford them . Their prevalence has increased significantly over the last decade , as the percentage of outpatients using private hospitals increased from 6 percent to 23 percent between 2005 and 2009 . Many of these private hospitals , as well as some of the public hospitals , are equipped with high @-@ tech equipment , including MRI machines , or associated with medical research centers . Turkey has more hospitals accredited by the U.S.-based Joint Commission than any other country in the world , with most concentrated in its big cities . The high quality of healthcare , especially in private hospitals , has contributed to a recent upsurge in medical tourism to Turkey ( with a 40 percent increase between 2007 and 2008 ) . Laser eye surgery is particularly common among medical tourists , as Turkey is known for specializing in the procedure . 
 = = Transportation = = 
 Istanbul 's primary motorways are the O @-@ 1 , O @-@ 2 , O @-@ 3 and O @-@ 4 . The O @-@ 1 forms the city 's inner ring road , traversing the Bosphorus Bridge , and the O @-@ 2 is the city 's outer ring road , crossing the Fatih Sultan Mehmet ( Second Bosphorus ) Bridge . The O @-@ 2 continues west to Edirne and the O @-@ 4 continues east to Ankara ; the O @-@ 2 , O @-@ 3 , and O @-@ 4 are part of European route <unk> ( the Trans @-@ European Motorway ) between Portugal and the Turkish – Iranian border . The two Bosphorus Bridges are currently the only road crossings between the Asian and European sides of Turkey , together carrying 400 @,@ 000 vehicles each day . The dual @-@ deck , 14 @.@ 6 @-@ kilometer ( 9 @.@ 1 mi ) Eurasia Tunnel is currently under construction beneath the Bosphorus , between Fatih and Üsküdar . A third Bosphorus bridge , first considered in the 1990s , may also finally be coming to fruition , as construction of the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge was officially launched in 2013 . Both projects may be completed as early as 2015 , although environmentalist groups worry that the third bridge will endanger the remaining green areas to the north of Istanbul . 
 Istanbul 's local public transportation system is a complex network of trams , <unk> , metro lines , buses , bus rapid transit , and ferries . Fares across modes are integrated , using the contactless <unk> , introduced in 2009 , or the older <unk> electronic ticket device . Trams in Istanbul date back to 1872 , when they were horse @-@ drawn , but even the first electrified trams were decommissioned in the 1960s . Operated by Istanbul Electricity , Tramway , and Tunnel General Management ( <unk> ) , trams slowly returned to the city in the 1990s with the introduction of a nostalgic route and a faster modern tram line , which now carries 265 @,@ 000 passengers each day . The <unk> opened in 1875 as the world 's second @-@ oldest subterranean rail line ( after London 's Metropolitan Railway ) . It still carries passengers between Karaköy and İstiklal Avenue along a steep 573 @-@ meter ( 1 @,@ 880 ft ) track ; a more modern funicular between Taksim Square and <unk> began running in 2006 . 
 The Istanbul Metro comprises three lines ( the M1 and M2 on the European side , and the M4 on the Asian side ) with several other lines ( such as the M3 , M5 , M7 , and M6 Mini @-@ Metro ) and extensions under construction . The two sides of Istanbul 's metro are connected under the Bosphorus by the Marmaray tunnel , inaugurated in 2013 as the first rail connection between Thrace and Anatolia . With the Marmaray 's completion , rail use in the city is expected to increase to 28 percent ( from 4 percent ) , behind only Tokyo and New York City . Until then , buses provide transportation within and between the two halves of the city , accommodating 2 @.@ 2 million passenger trips each day . The Metrobus , a form of bus rapid transit , crosses the Bosphorus Bridge , with dedicated lanes leading to its termini . <unk> ( Istanbul <unk> ) runs a combination of all @-@ passenger ferries and car @-@ and @-@ passenger ferries to ports on both sides of the Bosphorus , as far north as the Black Sea . With additional destinations around the Sea of Marmara , <unk> runs the largest municipal ferry operation in the world . The city 's main cruise ship terminal is the Port of Istanbul in Karaköy , with a capacity of 10 @,@ 000 passengers per hour . Most visitors enter Istanbul by air , but about half a million foreign tourists enter the city by sea each year . 
 International rail service from Istanbul launched in 1889 , with a line between Bucharest and Istanbul 's Sirkeci Terminal , which ultimately became famous as the eastern terminus of the Orient Express from Paris . Regular service to Bucharest and Thessaloniki continued until the early 2010s , when the former was interrupted for Marmaray construction and the latter was halted due to economic problems in Greece . After Istanbul 's Haydarpaşa Terminal opened in 1908 , it served as the western terminus of the Baghdad Railway and an extension of the Hejaz Railway ; today , neither service is offered directly from Istanbul . Service to Ankara and other points across Turkey is normally offered by Turkish State Railways , but the construction of Marmaray and the Ankara @-@ Istanbul high @-@ speed line forced the station to close in 2012 . New stations to replace both the Haydarpaşa and Sirkeci terminals , and connect the city 's disjointed railway networks , are expected to open upon completion of the Marmaray project ; until then , Istanbul is without intercity rail service . Private bus companies operate instead . Istanbul 's main bus station is the largest in Europe , with a daily capacity of 15 @,@ 000 buses and 600 @,@ 000 passengers , serving destinations as distant as Frankfurt . 
 Istanbul has two international airports . The larger is Istanbul Atatürk , 24 kilometers ( 15 mi ) west of the city center . It handled 61 @.@ 3 million passengers in 2015 , making it the third @-@ busiest airport in Europe and the eighteenth @-@ busiest in the world . <unk> <unk> International , 45 kilometers ( 28 mi ) southeast of the city center , opened in 2001 to relieve Atatürk . Dominated by low @-@ cost carriers , Istanbul 's second airport has rapidly become popular , especially since the opening of a new international terminal in 2009 ; the airport handled 14 @.@ 7 million passengers in 2012 , a year after Airports Council International named it the world 's fastest @-@ growing airport . Atatürk has also experienced rapid growth , as its 20 @.@ 6 percent rise in passenger traffic between 2011 and 2012 was the highest among the world 's top 30 airports . Because of the traffic at Istanbul 's current airports , a third international airport is planned for the Black Sea coast . Building a new runway at Atatürk Airport was rejected due to the cost involved ; environmental concerns have also been raised with respect to the new airport . Currently under construction , the new international airport will become the largest airport in the world upon the completion of all four stages of the project , with a capacity to serve 150 million passengers per year .

 Colonel James Philo Hagerstrom ( January 14 , 1921 – June 25 , 1994 ) was a fighter pilot and flying ace of the United States Army Air Forces in World War II and the United States Air Force in the Korean War . With a career total of 14 @.@ 5 victories , he is one of seven pilots to achieve ace status in two different wars . 
 Born in Cedar Falls , Iowa , Hagerstrom gained an interest in flying at a young age . He left college in 1941 and joined the U.S. Army Air Forces , being posted to New Guinea to fight in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II . There , Hagerstrom mainly escorted bombers with his Curtiss P @-@ 40 Warhawk , shooting down six Japanese aircraft over the course of the war , including four in one morning . After the war , he flew with the Texas Air National Guard . By 1950 he was in command of a fighter squadron that was mobilized to Korea following the outbreak of the Korean War . He later transferred to the United States Air Force and flew in MiG Alley in a North American F @-@ 86 Sabre , scoring 8 @.@ 5 victories over Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 15s . 
 Returning to the U.S. in 1953 , Hagerstrom remained in the Air Force until his retirement in 1968 , during which he earned a master 's degree in Economics and a law degree . In 1965 he was assigned to Vietnam but did not fly combat missions . After retiring , Hagerstrom traveled the Pacific in a homemade boat with his family , living in various Pacific islands before settling in Mansfield , Louisiana . Hagerstrom died in nearby Shreveport of stomach cancer in 1994 .

He " had the thrill of his life " when at thirteen he had a short flight in a Ford Trimotor aircraft . 
 Hagerstrom built model airplanes as a hobby . For " adrenaline release " , he joined the swimming and wrestling teams at Waterloo West High School . After graduating in January 1939 , he began studying at the University of Iowa in 1941 , where he participated in the Army Reserve Officers ' Training Corps . After a year there , he transferred to the University of Northern Iowa ( then known as Iowa State Teachers College ) , where he helped start an aero club .

Not long after , he and other new inductees went to Minter Field in Bakersfield , California for more physical examinations , and then they went north to Visalia for primary training in January 23 . The class ( which had to wear coveralls due to the lack of standard uniforms ) first trained in Ryan PT @-@ 22 Recruits before moving back to Minter Field for basic flight training in BT @-@ 13 Valiants . Along with his brother Robert , who had also enlisted , Hagerstrom spent about six weeks in basic training . Hagerstrom and his classmates then went to Luke Field near Phoenix , Arizona for advanced flight training in the North American AT @-@ 6 . On July 26 , 1942 , he was commissioned a second lieutenant and received his wings from Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead . 
 Hagerstrom was then sent to Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina and <unk> City Air Base in Florida , flying the Bell P @-@ 39 Airacobra and Curtiss P @-@ 40 Warhawk with the 20th Pursuit Group . In late September he was posted to the 8th Fighter Squadron ( 8th FS ) of the 49th Operations Group and sent to San Francisco , California . After staying at the Mark Hopkins Hotel , he and forty other personnel moved on to Fort Mason , where they boarded the <unk> ship M / V Torrens along with 1 @,@ 500 other officers and enlisted men comprising Headquarters , 5th Air Force to Hawaii . They did not stay long , however , and set sail again , this time flanked by a naval task force . After an overnight stop at Suva , Fiji , they landed at their destination of Townsville , Queensland , Australia . Initially there was no one there and nothing to do until Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith , the commander of Fifth Fighter Command , organized a refresher session for the new pilots at Charters Towers Airport . In April 1943 , he and the P @-@ 40 @-@ equipped 8th FS relocated to Dobodura Airfield Complex in New Guinea . Shortly thereafter , he was promoted to first lieutenant . 
 Hagerstrom first saw combat on April 11 , when he engaged in aerial combat over Oro Bay with several Japanese Zeros , destroying one of them . The 8th FS mainly escorted Douglas C @-@ 47 Skytrains dropping supplies to ground troops in the jungle . In late 1943 , the 49th Operations Group was moved to Tsili Tsili Airfield , recently captured from the Japanese and frequently bombed by them . The 8th FS then switched to escorting North American B @-@ 25 Mitchell and Douglas A @-@ 20 Havoc attacks but saw little action . They saw more combat protecting the Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B @-@ 24 Liberator bombers . On October 11 , Hagerstrom led one of two groups of four aircraft to intercept an approaching Mitsubishi Ki @-@ 46 reconnaissance aircraft over Finschhafen . He chased the plane for twelve minutes , flying at 270 miles per hour ( 430 km / h ) before getting within firing range . He shot down the aircraft by causing its left engine to explode , and the plane crashed . After his navigational instruments malfunctioned , he was forced to fly over the Japanese @-@ occupied town of Lae ; fortunately he caught them by surprise and was not shot at . With no fuel to spare , he safely landed at Tsili Tsili Airfield , which was in blackout due to an overhead enemy reconnaissance aircraft . Later that month , heavy rainfall made the airstrip too muddy to allow the Lockheed P @-@ 38 Lightnings to take off , and the P @-@ 40 squadrons , including the 8th FS , were relocated 50 miles ( 80 km ) north to Gusap Airfield . Soon after , Hagerstrom contracted malaria and went to Australia to recover for three weeks , after which he returned to his normal duties . 
 On January 23 , 1944 , Hagerstrom was leading one of four flights of four aircraft in an attempt to assist two P @-@ 38 Lightnings escorting bombers near Wewak . They encountered 10 – 15 enemy aircraft , and he shot down three Zeros ( more likely Nakajima Ki @-@ 43s ) and one Kawasaki Ki @-@ 61 " Tony " , making him an ace . He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his " extraordinary heroism " during the engagement . By the end of the war , he flew 170 combat missions and destroyed six enemy aircraft .

 Hagerstrom returned to the U.S. and in June 1945 was discharged from the USAAF . He wanted to complete his studies and soon after he was personally and immediately enrolled at the Iowa State Teachers College by the school 's president at Hagerstrom 's request to return to school . Hagerstrom graduated in 1948 with a degree in economics and subsequently went to Houston , Texas and entered the municipal bonds business . He also joined the 111th Fighter @-@ Bomber Squadron of the Texas Air National Guard , which he and his fellow pilots viewed as the " bottom of the heap " . However , he enjoyed his tenure there and flew the P @-@ 38 and P @-@ 51 Mustang in the 1948 Cleveland Air Races . Hagerstrom was promoted to major and appointed commander of the 111th . In October 1950 , the 111th squadron was federalized and ordered into active duty to serve in the Korean War . He was assigned to the headquarters of the Tactical Air Command , where he persuaded the commander to allow him and some other officers to fly a combat tour in Korea , where the war had been fought since June 1950 . They were allowed to transfer from the Air National Guard into the active @-@ duty Air Force . He was sent to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada , where he was instructed by William T. Whisner , Jr. in gunnery . He then was named operations officer of the 4th Fighter Group . 
 = = = Korean War = = = 
 Hagerstrom , determined to be an ace in two wars , studied MiG @-@ 15 reports , got a silk coat and special glasses that allowed him to see twice as far as normal , and made his own survival kit . He later transferred to the 334th Fighter Squadron of the Fifth U.S. Air Force 's 18th Wing , some members of which ( including Hagerstrom ) were equipped with North American F @-@ 86 Sabres . Hagerstrom got the wing 's first kill of the war on November 21 , 1952 near the Yalu River . The MiG pilot Hagerstrom was shooting at ejected just before his plane exploded , and a piece of that plane was embedded in Hagerstrom 's F @-@ 86 , proving the kill to Kimpo Air Base group commander Royal N. Baker . On December 25 , he got his second kill when the MiG he was chasing at an altitude of 50 @,@ 000 feet ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) spun out of control , and the pilot ejected , most likely dying of exposure to the − 20 ° F ( − 29 ° C ) temperatures . In January 1953 Hagerstrom was transferred to Osan Air Base to help with the transition from propeller P @-@ 38s to jet F @-@ 86s , and by mid @-@ February the wing 's 125 pilots were trained in the F @-@ 86 . On February 25 he was chasing two MiGs when he noticed a third attacking another F @-@ 86 ; he engaged and shot it down flying very low over Mukden , China . Low on fuel , he had just enough fuel to land and park the aircraft . 
 On March 13 , Hagerstrom and his wingman Elmer N. Dunlap came across two MiGs , the first of which Hagerstrom " shot the daylights out of " . He shot at the second until he ran out of ammunition , and the remaining MiG was leaking fuel and its engine had stopped . Hagerstrom told Dunlap to " finish off " the crippled plane , and the MiG 's pilot bailed over the enemy 's <unk> Airfield . That mission gave him a total of 4 @.@ 5 victories , just short of the five kills needed for ace status . On March 27 he sneaked up behind six MiGs and fired on one , but by " sheer ass luck ... it knocked his wing tip off . " He kept up the chase , shooting short bursts , until the pilot ejected right above his own base . On the way home , Hagerstrom destroyed another MiG , bringing the total to 6 @.@ 5 . He became the war 's 28th ace and would be the only from the 18th wing . Before the Air Force sent him back to the U.S. , he got one more MiG on April 13 . The day he left , he unexpectedly went on an impromptu mission , netting his last kill , a sum of 8 @.@ 5 throughout the whole war over 101 missions .

 Hagerstrom remained in the USAF after he returned to the U.S. and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in June 1954 . He commanded a F @-@ 86 squadron at Foster Air Force Base in Victoria , Texas and later headed the 450th Fighter @-@ Day Wing , equipped with the F @-@ 100 Super Sabre . In 1956 , he was transferred to Headquarters , Far East Air Forces in Japan as chief of the fighter branch . During that tour of duty , he briefly returned to Texas as an advisor for the Air National Guard and on April 13 – 14 , 1957 he was honored by the dedication of its new hangar at Ellington Field in Houston as " The James P. Hagerstrom Air National Guard Facility " . Later that spring , he moved to Hickam AFB , Hawaii , when Headquarters , Far East Air Forces ( renamed Pacific Air Forces ) relocated from Japan . In Hawaii he earned a master 's degree in economics and was promoted to the rank of colonel in March 1959 . In 1960 , he left Hawaii for a job with the Air Force Office of Inspector General , Flight Safety Division at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino , California . 
 While at Norton , he studied at Loyola Law School before attending the Industrial College of the Armed Forces , which required him to relocate to Washington , D.C. Shortly thereafter he enrolled at Georgetown University Law Center and completed his studies and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree . His next assignment was as vice commander of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing at George Air Force Base in Victorville , California . In 1965 , during the Vietnam War , he was posted to Vietnam to work for the Seventh Air Force . There , as director of the combat operations control center at Tan Son Nhut Air Base , he argued with General William Westmoreland over the Air Force 's role in the Military Assistance Command , Vietnam . Hagerstrom proposed that air assets be used against strategic targets in North Vietnam while the Westmoreland insisted that they be used solely in @-@ country to support Army ground operations . Eventually Westmoreland asked the Air Force to remove him from Vietnam . In early 1966 , the Air Force reassigned Hagerstrom to Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base , Thailand where he quickly set up a similar combat operations control center to conduct air interdiction operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail .

 After he retired from the Air Force in February 1968 , he lectured at the University of Southern California and worked for a law firm in Los Angeles . After that , he and his wife Virginia Lee Jowell and their eight children traveled the Pacific in a homemade boat , living in Hawaii , the Marshall Islands , the Federated States of Micronesia , and Guam . He met his wife in 1944 in Orlando , Florida , where she was a P @-@ 47 Thunderbolt ferry pilot and member of the Women Airforce Service Pilots . In Pohnpei , Hagerstrom practiced law , while his wife taught at a college . They eventually returned to the United States and settled in Mansfield , Louisiana , and after living there for a few years , James Hagerstrom died of stomach cancer on June 25 , 1994 , in nearby Shreveport . On July 26 , he was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery .

 = Douglas MacArthur 's escape from the Philippines = 
 Douglas MacArthur 's escape from the Philippines began on 11 March 1942 , during World War II , when General Douglas MacArthur and members of his family and staff left Corregidor Island , where his forces had been surrounded by the Japanese . They traveled in PT boats ( patrol torpedo boats ) for two days through stormy seas patrolled by Japanese warships to reach Mindanao . From there , MacArthur and his party flew to Australia in a pair of Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses , ultimately arriving in Melbourne by train on 21 March . In Australia , he made his famous speech in which he declared , " I came through and I shall return " . 
 MacArthur was a well @-@ known and experienced officer with a distinguished record in World War I , who had retired from the United States Army in 1937 and had become a defense advisor to the Philippine government . He was recalled to active duty with the United States Army in July 1941 , a few months before the outbreak of the Pacific War between the United States and the Empire of Japan , to become commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East ( USAFFE ) , uniting the Philippine and United States Armies under one command . 
 By March 1942 , the Japanese invasion of the Philippines had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on Luzon to Bataan , while his headquarters and his family moved to Corregidor . The doomed defense of Bataan captured the imagination of the American public . At a time when the news from all fronts was uniformly bad , MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese . 
 Fearing that Corregidor would soon fall , and MacArthur would be taken prisoner , President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to go to Australia . A submarine was made available , but MacArthur elected to break through the Japanese blockade in PT boats under the command of Lieutenant ( junior grade ) John D. Bulkeley . The staff MacArthur brought with him became known as the " Bataan Gang " . They would become the nucleus of his General Headquarters ( GHQ ) Southwest Pacific Area ( SWPA ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 Douglas MacArthur was a well @-@ known and experienced officer . The son of Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur Jr . , who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his services in the American Civil War , MacArthur had graduated at the top of the United States Military Academy class of 1903 . He was an aide @-@ de @-@ camp to his father from 1905 to 1906 , and to President Theodore Roosevelt from 1906 to 1907 . During World War I he commanded the 84th Brigade of the 42nd ( Rainbow ) Division in the fighting on the Western Front . After the war he served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy , and as Chief of Staff of the United States Army . He retired from the United States Army in 1937 , and became a field marshal in the Philippine Army . 
 MacArthur 's job was to advise the Philippine government on defense matters , and prepare the Philippine defense forces when the Philippines became fully independent , which was to be in 1946 . The Philippine Army , almost entirely manned and officered by Filipinos with only a small number of American advisors , was raised by conscription , with two classes of 20 @,@ 000 men being trained each year , starting in 1937 . In addition , there was a regular U.S. Army garrison of about 10 @,@ 000 , half of whom were Filipinos serving in the U.S. Army known as Philippine Scouts . When MacArthur was recalled from retirement in July 1941 to become commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East ( USAFFE ) at the age of 61 , he united the Philippine and United States Armies under one command . 
 In getting the Philippine Army ready for war , MacArthur faced an enormous task On a visit to the United States in 1937 , MacArthur lobbied the Navy Department for the development of PT boats — small , fast boats armed with torpedoes — for which he believed that the geography of the Philippines , with its shallow waters and many coves , was ideally suited . The nascent Philippine Navy acquired three , known as Q boats , after President Manuel L. Quezon . In August 1941 , the U.S. Navy created Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three , under the command of Lieutenant ( junior grade ) John D. Bulkeley . It was a half @-@ strength squadron , with only six PT boats instead of the normal twelve , numbered 31 to 35 and 41 . It arrived at Manila in September 1941 . It was understood that a fleet consisting of more than PT boats would be required for a successful defense of the Philippines . 
 As early as 1907 , U.S. naval and military planners had concluded that it would be impractical to repel an invasion of the Philippines . The best that could be hoped for was that the garrison could hold out on the Bataan peninsula until help arrived . In the 1920s it was estimated that they could do so for about 60 days . By the 1930s , the planners had become decidedly pessimistic in view of the increased capability of aircraft , and by 1936 they were agreed that the Philippine should be written off . But in July 1941 , this decision was abruptly reversed , and it became the policy of the U.S. government to defend and hold the Philippines . This was based , at least in part , in the belief that Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress bombers could deter or defeat an invading force . 
 Soon after the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941 , MacArthur , in accordance with the pre @-@ war plan , declared Manila an open city , and ordered his forces on Luzon to withdraw to Bataan . The Philippine government , the High Commissioner 's office and MacArthur 's USAFFE headquarters moved to Corregidor Island . Although the dependents of U.S. military personnel had been sent back to the United States , MacArthur was , until his recall from retirement , a Philippine government employee , so his family had remained in the Philippines . MacArthur 's wife , Jean MacArthur , and young son , Arthur MacArthur IV , went with him to Corregidor . Arthur celebrated his fourth birthday on Corregidor , on 21 February 1942 . When an aide asked about Arthur 's possible fate , MacArthur replied : " He is a soldier 's son . " 
 Most of the United States Asiatic Fleet retired to the south of the Philippines . A small force was left behind under the command of Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell consisting of the submarine tender USS Canopus , the submarine rescue ship Pigeon , gunboats Oahu , Luzon and Mindanao , minesweepers Finch , Tanager and Quail , five tugboats , three small patrol boats , and the PT boats of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three . The loss of Manila and the U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay meant that fuel and spare parts became scarce . The PT boats relied on Canopus and the floating dry dock USS Dewey for assistance with maintenance . Despite this , Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three continued to patrol . On 17 December , PT @-@ 32 , PT @-@ 34 and PT @-@ 35 rescued 296 survivors from SS Corregidor , which had been carrying refugees to Australia when it struck a mine and sank in Manila Bay . A week later , PT @-@ 33 ran aground while patrolling south of Manila Bay , and was set on fire to prevent her being salvaged by the Japanese . PT @-@ 31 met a similar fate a month later , after its engines failed and it drifted onto a reef . The PT boats attacked enemy barges off Luzon on the night of 23 January 1942 , a small Japanese warship on 1 February , and a small vessel , probably a fishing trawler , on 17 February . 
 = = Decision = = 
 = = = Washington = = = 
 In a message to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington , D.C. , on 11 February , MacArthur announced that he and his family intended to " share the fate of the garrison " . This meant surrender at best ; MacArthur knew that death from artillery fire or an air raid was also likely . Three days later , the Chief of Staff of the United States Army , George C. Marshall , urged MacArthur to send his family away , but MacArthur ignored this part of the message . Singapore , once considered impregnable , fell on 15 February , and in Washington , the possibility that Corregidor would also fall and MacArthur would be taken prisoner was considered . MacArthur was America 's most experienced general , but would be of little use in a prisoner of war camp . Moreover , he had become a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese . The brave but doomed defense of Bataan had captured the imagination of the American public , who saw MacArthur as the only Allied general who knew how to fight the Japanese . Walter R. Borneman noted that : 
 in a fragile period of the American psyche when the general American public , still stunned by the shock of Pearl Harbor and uncertain what lay ahead in Europe , desperately needed a hero , they wholeheartedly embraced Douglas MacArthur — good press copy that he was . There simply were no other choices that came close to matching his mystique , not to mention his evocative lone @-@ wolf stand — something that always resonated with Americans . 
 Secretary of State Cordell Hull raised the possibility of MacArthur 's evacuation . Brigadier General Dwight Eisenhower wrote in his diary : 
 I cannot help thinking that we are disturbed by editorials and reacting to " public opinion " rather than to military logic . " Pa " Watson is certain we must get MacArthur out , as being worth " five Army corps . " 
 The President considered sending MacArthur to Mindanao to coordinate the defense of the Philippines from there , but another consideration arose . The fall of Singapore sealed the fate of the American @-@ British @-@ Dutch @-@ Australian Command ( ABDA ) , of which MacArthur 's command was nominally a part . Discussions were held with the British about future command arrangements . A broad agreement was reached that the United States would assume responsibility for the Southwest Pacific . A senior American officer was required , and MacArthur was the obvious choice . On 23 February , MacArthur received a message that had been drafted by the President , Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and Marshall . It read : 
 The President directs that you make arrangements to leave and proceed to Mindanao . You are directed to make this change as quickly as possible … From Mindanao you will proceed to Australia where you will assume command of all United States troops … Instructions will be given from here at your request for the movement of submarine or plane or both to enable you to carry out the foregoing instructions . You are authorized to take your chief of staff General Sutherland . 
 = = = Corregidor = = = 
 MacArthur responded with a request that he might select the time of his departure . " Unless the right moment is chosen for this delicate operation " , he wrote , " a sudden collapse might occur . " " With regard to the actual movement " , he went on , " I deem it advisable to go to Mindanao by combined use of surface craft and submarine , and thence by air , further movement by submarine being too time consuming . " Marshall replied that the President would allow him to choose the time and method of his departure . ABDA was dissolved on 27 February , and MacArthur nominally came under Dutch command , but was ordered to continue communicating directly with the War Department . 
 MacArthur inspected the PT boat squadron on 1 March . With air cover provided by his four remaining Curtiss P @-@ 40 Warhawks , MacArthur and his wife Jean took a half @-@ hour ride on PT @-@ 41 . Although the sea was tranquil , Jean still felt queasy . Ostensibly , the purpose of MacArthur 's visit was presenting Bulkeley with the Distinguished Service Cross for sinking an " unidentified 5 @,@ 000 @-@ ton enemy ship with torpedoes without serious damage to his ship or casualty to his crew " , but afterwards MacArthur took Bulkeley aside and asked him if it would be possible to make the 600 @-@ mile ( 970 @-@ kilometre ) journey through uncharted waters at night in PT boats . Bulkeley told him that it would be " a piece of cake . " 
 When some days passed without any further word on the matter , follow @-@ up messages were sent on 6 and 9 March . By 10 March , MacArthur had decided that the Bataan front was not in danger of imminent collapse , and replied that he planned to depart on 15 March , when the submarine USS Permit was scheduled to arrive at Corregidor . Radio broadcasts in the United States calling for MacArthur to be placed in charge in Australia had been picked up by MacArthur 's headquarters in Corregidor , and it had to be assumed that the Japanese had heard them too . There were ominous signs : Japanese surface patrols had been stepped up in the Subic Bay area , and there were reports of Japanese destroyers heading north from the southern Philippines . MacArthur therefore elected not to wait for the Permit , but to leave as soon as possible , by PT boat on the night of 11 March . Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright was left in command on Bataan and Corregidor . " When I get back " , MacArthur told him , " if you 're still on Bataan , I 'll make you a lieutenant general . " Wainwright replied : " I 'll be on Bataan if I 'm still alive . " 
 Of the decision to depart by PT boat rather than wait for the submarine , Lieutenant Robert B. Kelly , executive officer of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three , and commander of PT @-@ 34 , later recalled : 
 Having served with Lieutenant Bulkeley as his second in command on this and a prior assignment , I was privy to much of what transpired during his conferences with General MacArthur during the decision making process . MacArthur 's decision to use the PT boats for the evacuation of his part dramatically emphasized to the American public the overwhelming odds against which the United States was fighting in the Philippines . It evened an old score with the United States Navy . And since he had a tendency towards claustrophobia and did not relish making the trip on a submerged submarine with a commander whom he did not personally know , it provided an acceptable alternative which he elected to exercise . 
 = = Escape = = 
 = = = Preparations = = = 
 Bulkeley and his crews overhauled the PT boats for the voyage . All of the engines had performed hard war service , and had been operated for double the recommended mileage without overhaul . As a result , they were reduced to operating at half speed . Since there were no replacement parts , the gaskets , which normally would have been discarded , had to be carefully cleaned and replaced . Each PT boat would carry twenty 55 @-@ gallon drums of additional fuel on the deck . This reduced the top speed of the boats to about 30 knots ( 56 kilometres per hour ; 35 miles per hour ) . To make room for the passengers , Bulkeley had to leave 32 of his men behind , who would be sent to fight as infantry on Bataan . 
 MacArthur 's chief of staff , Major General Richard K. Sutherland , drew up the passenger lists . Rockwell and his chief of staff , Captain Herbert Ray , were ordered to accompany MacArthur . They were already under orders to return by submarine , but this was switched to accompanying MacArthur when his date of departure was brought forward . A United States Army Air Corps officer , Major General Harold H. George , was included at the request of the United States Army Air Forces . 
 MacArthur was accompanied by his family : his wife Jean , four @-@ year @-@ old son Arthur , and Arthur 's Cantonese amah , Ah Cheu . MacArthur later defended his decision to take her instead of an American nurse . " Few people outside the Orient " , he wrote , " know how completely a member of the family an amah can become , and Ah Cheu had been with us since Arthur 's birth . Because of her relationship to my family , her death would have been certain had she been left behind . " 
 In case a doctor was needed , Major Charles H. Morhouse was summoned from Bataan to accompany the party . The remaining thirteen were members of MacArthur 's staff . They were loyal and experienced , and some of them had been with MacArthur for years . Creating a new staff in Australia would have taken time , while taking his existing one would enable him to commence work soon after arrival in Australia . They would be more valuable there than in the Philippines . Sutherland included two of his own men : his assistant , Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson , and his stenographer , Master Sergeant Paul P. Rogers . Promoted from private that day , Rogers was the only enlisted man on the list , which he typed . A number of men gave him letters to post . 
 Because there was no food for the passengers on the PT boats , Jean and MacArthur 's aide @-@ de @-@ camp , Lieutenant Colonel Sidney L. Huff , packed tins of food into four duffel bags , one for each PT boat . Huff removed the four @-@ star rank number plates from MacArthur 's car so they could be used in Australia , and took a mattress for the MacArthurs to lie on . Stories later circulated that it was full of cash or gold . Other stories had it that furniture from MacArthur 's residence in the Manila Hotel had been loaded on board the PT boats , even , in one version of the story , the piano . In fact , each passenger was limited to one piece of luggage weighing 35 pounds ( 16 kilograms ) or less . Jean took a small suitcase with some clothes . It sported a label from the Hotel New Grand in Yokohama , where she stayed during her honeymoon . Ah Cheu wrapped her possessions in a handkerchief . MacArthur took nothing . 
 = = = PT boat voyage = = = 
 Only PT @-@ 41 , which carried MacArthur and his family , departed from Corregidor 's North Dock . The passengers of the remaining boats were taken to Bataan in launches and boarded their PT boats there . While his family boarded , MacArthur spoke to Major General George F. Moore , the commander of the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays . " George " , he told him , " keep the flag flying . I 'm coming back . " 
 PT @-@ 41 departed at 19 : 45 on 11 March and joined the other three 15 minutes later . A navy minelayer led the PT boats through the protective minefield in single file . The boats then assumed a diamond formation , with PT @-@ 41 in the lead and PT @-@ 34 bringing up the rear . If attacked by the Japanese , PT @-@ 41 was to flee while the other three boats engaged the enemy . The seas were moderate , but most of the passengers quickly became seasick . MacArthur later recalled : 
 The weather deteriorated steadily , and towering waves buffeted our tiny , war @-@ weary , blacked @-@ out vessels . The spray drove against our skin like stinging pellets of birdshot . We would fall into a trough , then climb up the steep water peak , only to slide down the other side . The boat would toss crazily back and forth , seeming to hang free in space as though about to breach , and would then break away and go forward with a rush . I recall describing the experience afterward as what it must be like to take a trip in a concrete mixer . 
 During the night , the four boats became separated . Bulkeley spent time looking for the other three boats , but was unable to find them in the darkness . At dawn he gave up , and headed for one of the alternative hiding places . Kelly 's PT @-@ 34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point , a cove on Tagauayan Island , two hours late at 09 : 30 . There was no sign of the other boats , and Rockwell , in the same boat with Kelly , was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island . Some repairs were made , and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums . Two men were posted atop the island 's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the other boats . 
 PT @-@ 32 , which had only two good engines , had straggled behind the others . Around dawn , Schumacher spotted what appeared to be a Japanese destroyer heading towards him . He jettisoned his fuel drums so he could increase speed and run from it . He ordered his crew to man the .50 @-@ caliber machine guns and get ready to launch torpedoes . Akin prepared to toss a barracks bag filled with code books overboard . However , as the light improved , and the vessel drew closer , another look though the binoculars revealed that it was not a Japanese destroyer at all , but PT @-@ 41 , carrying an angry Bulkeley . Schumacher was ordered to recover the drums he had jettisoned , but this proved to be a time @-@ consuming task , and a dangerous one in broad daylight , and it had to be abandoned after only a few drums were recovered . Bulkeley had his gunners sink the rest . The two boats then hid for the day in a nearby cove . 
 In the afternoon , PT @-@ 41 and PT @-@ 32 made their way to Tagauayan , where they found PT @-@ 34 . There was a discussion about whether to proceed to Mindanao , or wait for Permit . Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher . But , since there was no assurance that the submarine would make it , MacArthur decided to continue , departing in daylight at 18 : 00 so as to be sure to meet their air transport there . Since PT @-@ 32 had no fuel to make Mindanao , its passengers were divided between PT @-@ 41 and PT @-@ 34 . Soon after they had departed , PT @-@ 35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point . Akers found the crew of PT @-@ 32 there , and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone . He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well . 
 At 19 : 00 , about an hour after they had left Tagauayan , PT @-@ 34 and PT @-@ 41 spotted a Japanese cruiser . Bulkeley made a sharp turn due west , and headed at top speed , about 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) , into the setting sun . Whether because of the high waves , the glare of the sun , or simple inattentiveness , the cruiser did not spot them . After midnight , the weather began to worsen , with heavy swells and sporadic squalls . Kelly later recalled : 
 Big foaming waves fifteen or twenty feet high thundering over the cockpit , drenching everybody . Our binoculars were full of water and our eyes so continuously drenched with stinging salt that we couldn 't see , in addition to which it was pitch @-@ black . We were making good speed through strange waters with islands all around us . We could see the outlines of the big ones — Negros and Mindanao — very dimly against the horizon through the storm . But there were dozens of small ones and probably hundreds of reefs . 
 You had to keep one hand in front of your eyes to avoid the slapping force of the water and yet you needed both to hold on . 
 The Admiral was pretty wrought up . " I 've sailed every type of ship in the Navy except one of these MTBs " , he shouted at me above the wind , " and this is the worst bridge I 've ever been on . I wouldn 't do duty on one of these for anything in the world — you can have them . " 
 By dawn , the winds and swells had subsided , but the delay caused by the bad weather had slowed the two boats , and they now had to travel across the Mindanao Sea in daylight . Cagayan was sighted shortly after 06 : 30 on 13 March . Although PT @-@ 34 had led all the way from Tagauayan , Kelly now let Bulkeley take the lead , as he had the channel charts . PT @-@ 41 therefore pulled up at the wharf first , with MacArthur on the bow . They were met by Colonel William Morse , an officer on the staff of the Brigadier General William F. Sharp , the commander of U.S. forces on Mindanao . MacArthur told Bulkeley " I 'm giving every officer and man here the Silver Star for gallantry . You 've taken me out of the jaws of death , and I won 't forget it . " 
 A few hours later , PT @-@ 35 reached Cagayan . Willoughby later recalled : 
 We were behind schedule and reached the north coast of Mindanao in broad daylight . It was a clear , dazzling day . Fortunately , no Japanese planes cut across the blue sky , though the enemy was known to make regular mail flights from Mindanao to Luzon . We were pretty conspicuous as the hours dragged on . 
 USS Permit , under the command of Lieutenant Wreford G. Chapple , reached Tagauayan on 13 March , and found PT @-@ 32 . With two of his three engines out of action , Schumacher felt that his boat was no longer seaworthy . He had Chapple destroy the boat with Permit 's deck gun . Chapple then took the fifteen PT @-@ 32 crewmen back to Corregidor . There , eight of the crew were disembarked , while Chapple embarked forty more passengers , thirty @-@ six of them codebreakers . Nonetheless , Chapple was ordered to conduct a regular war patrol , which he did . He finally reached Australia on 7 April . Unaware of this , Bulkeley attempted to locate PT @-@ 32 . Over the next few days he flew over the area as a passenger in various aircraft , including a P @-@ 35 and a P @-@ 40 , in the hope of finding it . 
 = = = Aircraft = = = 
 The commander of U.S. Army Forces in Australia , Lieutenant General George H. Brett , received a radiogram from General Marshall in Washington , D.C. , alerting him that MacArthur would be requesting bombers to transport his party from Mindanao to Australia . A subsequent message from MacArthur requested his " most experienced pilots , and the best available planes in top condition " , but the only long @-@ range aircraft that Brett had were Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses of the 19th Bombardment Group which had seen hard service in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies campaigns . He therefore approached Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary , the commander of naval forces in the Anzac Area , to ask for a loan of some of twelve newly arrived Navy B @-@ 17s . Leary , who had a reputation for refusing requests unless he could see how the Navy would benefit , turned Brett down . 
 Brett therefore sent four of the 19th Bombardment Group 's old planes . Two were forced to turn back with engine trouble . One of the others accidentally dumped 300 US gallons ( 1 @,@ 100 litres ; 250 imperial gallons ) of its fuel . The pilot flew on , and nearly made it to Del Monte Field , but , just a few miles from his destination , the fuel tanks ran dry and the engines stopped . The B @-@ 17 crash landed in the sea . Two of the crew were killed , but the rest made it to shore , and thence to Del Monte Field . Only one B @-@ 17 , piloted by Lieutenant Harl Pease , reached Del Monte , and this B @-@ 17 was in poor condition , with no brakes and a faulty supercharger . Sharp ordered it back to Australia before MacArthur arrived . Despite the lack of brakes , Pease made the return trip , carrying sixteen passengers . 
 Thus , with the arrival of PT @-@ 35 , all of MacArthur 's group had reached Mindanao safely , but there were no aircraft at Del Monte Field to meet them . They were taken to the Del Monte Plantation , where they were lodged in the guest houses , and had breakfast in the clubhouse . MacArthur sent a couple of sharp messages to Brett in Melbourne and Marshall in Washington . On their second day there , a Filipino woman arrived who wanted to speak to MacArthur . Her son was fighting on Luzon , and she had walked 25 miles ( 40 kilometres ) in the hope that the general would have some news about him . He did not , but the fact that she was aware of MacArthur 's presence was disturbing to the party , as the Japanese were only 30 miles ( 48 km ) away , at Davao on the south coast of Mindanao . 
 Brett went back to Leary , expecting to be turned down again , but this time , Leary gave Brett the aircraft he wanted . " Perhaps " , Brett speculated , " Leary had heard from Washington " . The newly formed 40th Reconnaissance Squadron manned the bombers . One B @-@ 17 turned back , but two made it to Del Monte Field on 16 March , landing in the dark on a runway lit by flares . Lieutenant Frank P. Bostrom , the pilot of the first plane , calculated that everyone could be carried in just two planes if they left most of their baggage behind . They divided into two groups and the two bombers took off at 01 : 30 on 17 March . MacArthur rode in the radio operator 's seat , which did not need to be manned as the aircraft were travelling under radio silence . For most of the passengers , the trip was dark and cold , with only a blanket between them and the metal skin of the aircraft . 
 As the two planes approached Darwin , word was received that a Japanese air raid was in progress there . The two B @-@ 17s therefore flew on to Batchelor Airfield , where they touched down at 09 : 30 . MacArthur awarded Silver Stars to the crews of the two bombers . Brett 's chief of staff , Brigadier General Ralph Royce , was on hand to greet them , and Brett had sent two Australian National Airways DC @-@ 3s to bring them to Melbourne . However , Jean now refused to fly any further , so MacArthur asked for a motorcade to take them to the nearest railway station , which was at Alice Springs , 1 @,@ 000 miles ( 1 @,@ 600 km ) away . Sutherland had received word of an incoming Japanese air raid , and asked Morhouse to intervene . Morhouse told MacArthur that Arthur , who had suffered badly from seasickness and airsickness , was on an intravenous feed , and could not guarantee that he would survive the trip across the desert . MacArthur then agreed to take the planes to Alice Springs . Sutherland had Huff hurry everyone onto the aircraft , which took off as the air raid siren sounded . 
 At Alice Springs , the party split up . MacArthur , his family , Sutherland , Morhouse and Huff took a special train that Brett had borrowed from the Australians , while the rest of the staff flew down to Melbourne via Adelaide in the DC @-@ 3s . His famous speech , in which he said , " I came through and I shall return " , was first made at Terowie , a small town in South Australia , on 20 March , where he changed trains . On 21 March , MacArthur 's journey was completed when his train rolled into Spencer Street Station , where he was greeted by the Australian Minister for the Army , Frank Forde .

 Roosevelt issued a public statement on 17 March : 
 I know that every man and woman in the United States admires with me General MacArthur 's determination to fight to the finish with his men in the Philippines . But I also know that every man and woman is in agreement that all important decisions must be made with a view toward the successful termination of the war . Knowing this , I am sure that every American , if faced individually with the question as to where General MacArthur could best serve his country , could come to only one answer . 
 On Bataan , the reaction to MacArthur 's escape was mixed , with many American and Filipino troops feeling bitter and betrayed . When Wainwright broke the news to his generals " they were all at first depressed by the news … But I soon saw that they understood just as I understood . " Some people with family members in the Philippines were dismayed . One wrote to Roosevelt that " Nothing you could have done would have broken their morale and that of their parents at home so thoroughly " . Wainwright held out on Corregidor until 6 May . To Joseph Goebbels , MacArthur was a " fleeing general " , while Benito Mussolini labeled him a coward . Marshall decided that the best way to counter this was to award MacArthur the Medal of Honor . 
 In April 1942 , Bulkeley led his squadron in an attack on the Japanese cruiser Kuma . The PT boats scored a hit on the cruiser , but the torpedo was a dud , and failed to explode . No damage resulted . With the loss of Cebu City , there were no more torpedoes , so the active careers of the remaining boats of Bulkeley 's squadron came to an end . MacArthur gave PT boat officers a high priority to be flown out from Mindanao . Bulkeley was flown out on MacArthur 's orders on 13 April . Knox , Kelly and Akers were evacuated on 23 April , and Brantingham also made one of the last flights out from Mindanao . Sharp surrendered on Mindanao on 10 May . 
 MacArthur subsequently nominated Bulkeley for the Medal of Honor . The Commander in Chief , U.S. Fleet , Admiral Ernest King was not going to let MacArthur award the Medal of Honor to a naval officer , so he wrote a citation for Bulkeley on behalf of the Navy . Roosevelt presented it to Bulkeley in a ceremony in the Oval Office on 4 August 1942 . Bulkeley wrote a book about his exploits , entitled They Were Expendable . Parts were serialized in Reader 's Digest and Life magazines and it became a bestseller in 1942 . In 1944 , it was adapted as a movie of the same name , with Robert Montgomery playing a character based on Bulkeley , John Wayne one based on Kelly , and Donna Reed in the role of an Army nurse with whom Kelly had a brief liaison . Postwar analysis found that most of the book 's claims were exaggerated . 
 The staff that MacArthur brought with him from Corregidor formed the nucleus of General Headquarters ( GHQ ) Southwest Pacific Area ( SWPA ) . The " Bataan Gang " , as they came to be called , remained with MacArthur for the duration , and were noted for their fanatical loyalty to him . So too was Bulkeley , who lauded MacArthur as " the greatest general as well as statesman since George Washington " , and hailed his decision to escape on PT boats as a stroke of genius . MacArthur eventually kept his promise , and returned to the Philippines . The Bataan Gang returned to Corregidor in March 1945 on four PT boats . 
 = Nikolai Rimsky @-@ Korsakov = 
 Nikolai Andreyevich Rimsky @-@ Korsakov ( Russian : Никола ́ й Андре ́ евич <unk> ́ <unk> @-@ <unk> ́ <unk> ; IPA : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ] 18 March [ O.S. 6 March ] 1844 – 21 June [ O.S. 8 June ] 1908 ) was a Russian composer , and a member of the group of composers known as The Five . He was a master of orchestration . His best @-@ known orchestral compositions — Capriccio Espagnol , the Russian Easter Festival Overture , and the symphonic suite Scheherazade — are staples of the classical music repertoire , along with suites and excerpts from some of his 15 operas . Scheherazade is an example of his frequent use of fairy tale and folk subjects . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov believed , as did fellow composer Mily Balakirev and critic Vladimir Stasov , in developing a nationalistic style of classical music . This style employed Russian folk song and lore along with exotic harmonic , melodic and rhythmic elements in a practice known as musical orientalism , and eschewed traditional Western compositional methods . However , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov appreciated Western musical techniques after he became a professor of musical composition , harmony and orchestration at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1871 . He undertook a rigorous three @-@ year program of self @-@ education and became a master of Western methods , incorporating them alongside the influences of Mikhail Glinka and fellow members of The Five . His techniques of composition and orchestration were further enriched by his exposure to the works of Richard Wagner . 
 For much of his life , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov combined his composition and teaching with a career in the Russian military — at first as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy , then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands . He wrote that he developed a passion for the ocean in childhood from reading books and hearing of his older brother 's exploits in the navy . This love of the sea might have influenced him to write two of his best @-@ known orchestral works , the musical tableau Sadko ( not to be confused with his later opera of the same name ) and Scheherazade . Through his service as Inspector of Naval Bands , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov expanded his knowledge of woodwind and brass playing , which enhanced his abilities in orchestration . He passed this knowledge to his students , and also posthumously through a textbook on orchestration that was completed by his son @-@ in @-@ law , Maximilian Steinberg . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov left a considerable body of original Russian nationalist compositions . He prepared works by The Five for performance , which brought them into the active classical repertoire ( although there is controversy over his editing of the works of Modest Mussorgsky ) , and shaped a generation of younger composers and musicians during his decades as an educator . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov is therefore considered " the main architect " of what the classical music public considers the Russian style of composition . His influence on younger composers was especially important , as he served as a transitional figure between the <unk> which exemplified Glinka and The Five and professionally trained composers which would become the norm in Russia by the closing years of the 19th century . While Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's style was based on those of Glinka , Balakirev , Hector Berlioz , and Franz Liszt , he " transmitted this style directly to two generations of Russian composers " and influenced non @-@ Russian composers including Maurice Ravel , Claude Debussy , Paul Dukas and Ottorino Respighi . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov was born in Tikhvin , 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) east of Saint Petersburg . The father of the composer , Andrei Petrovich Rimsky @-@ Korsakov ( 1784 @-@ 1862 ) , though born out of wedlock , went on to serve first as the vice @-@ governor of Novgorod , and then in the Volhynian Governorate . The composer 's mother , <unk> <unk> , was the daughter of a peasant serf and a <unk> ( landlord ) . The Rimsky @-@ Korsakov family had a long line of military and naval service . Nikolai 's older brother Voin , 22 years his senior , became a well @-@ known navigator and explorer and had a powerful influence on Nikolai 's life . He later recalled that his mother played the piano a little , and his father could play a few songs on the piano by ear . Beginning at six , he took piano lessons from local teachers and showed a talent for aural skills , but he showed a lack of interest , playing , as he later wrote , " badly , carelessly , ... poor at keeping time . " Although he started composing by age 10 , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov preferred literature over music . He later wrote that from his reading , and tales of his brother 's exploits , he developed a poetic love for the sea " without ever having seen it . " This love , and prompting from Voin , encouraged the 12 @-@ year @-@ old to join the Imperial Russian Navy . He studied at the School for Mathematical and Navigational Sciences in Saint Petersburg and , at 18 , took his final examination in April 1862 . 
 While at school , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov took piano lessons from a man named <unk> . These lessons were sanctioned by Voin , who now served as director of the school , because he hoped they would help the youth to develop social skills and overcome his shyness . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote that , while " indifferent " to lessons , he developed a love for music , fostered by visits to the opera and , later , orchestral concerts . <unk> perceived that he had serious musical talent and recommended another teacher , Feodor A. Kanille ( Théodore <unk> ) . Beginning in the autumn of 1859 , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov took lessons in piano and composition from Kanille , whom he later credited as the inspiration for devoting his life to musical composition . Through Kanille , he was exposed to a great deal of new music , including Mikhail Glinka and Robert Schumann . Despite Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's now liking his music lessons , Voin cancelled them when Rimsky @-@ Korsakov was 17 , as he felt they no longer served a practical need . Kanille told Rimsky @-@ Korsakov to continue coming to him every Sunday , not for formal lessons but to play duets and discuss music . In November 1861 , Kanille introduced the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Rimsky @-@ Korsakov to Mily Balakirev . Balakirev in turn introduced him to César Cui and Modest Mussorgsky ; all three were known as composers , despite only being in their 20s . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov later wrote , " With what delight I listened to real business discussions [ Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's emphasis ] of instrumentation , part writing , etc ! And besides , how much talking there was about current musical matters ! All at once I had been plunged into a new world , unknown to me , formerly only heard of in the society of my dilettante friends . That was truly a strong impression . " 
 Balakirev encouraged Rimsky @-@ Korsakov to compose and taught him the rudiments when he was not at sea . Balakirev also prompted him to enrich himself in history , literature and criticism . When he showed Balakirev the beginning of a symphony in E @-@ flat minor that he had written , Balakirev insisted he continue working on it despite his lack of formal musical training . By the time Rimsky @-@ Korsakov sailed on a two @-@ year @-@ and @-@ eight @-@ month cruise aboard the clipper Almaz in late 1862 , he had completed and orchestrated three movements of the symphony . He composed the slow movement during a stop in England and mailed the score to Balakirev before going back to sea . At first , his work on the symphony kept Rimsky @-@ Korsakov occupied during his cruise . He purchased scores at every port of call , along with a piano on which to play them , and filled his idle hours studying Berlioz 's Treatise on Instrumentation . He found time to read the works of Homer , William Shakespeare , Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe ; he saw London , Niagara Falls , and Rio de Janeiro during his stops in port . Eventually , the lack of outside musical stimuli dulled the young midshipman 's hunger to learn . He wrote to Balakirev that after two years at sea he had neglected his musical lessons for months . " Thoughts of becoming a musician and composer gradually left me altogether , " he later recalled ; " distant lands began to allure me , somehow , although , properly speaking , naval service never pleased me much and hardly suited my character at all . " 
 = = = Mentored by Balakirev ; time with The Five = = = 
 Once back in Saint Petersburg in May 1865 , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's onshore duties consisted of a couple of hours of clerical duty each day , but he recalled that his desire to compose " had been stifled ... I did not concern myself with music at all . " He wrote that contact with Balakirev in September 1865 encouraged him " to get accustomed to music and later to plunge into it " . At Balakirev 's suggestion , he wrote a trio to the scherzo of the E @-@ flat minor symphony , which it had lacked up to that point , and reorchestrated the entire symphony . Its first performance came in December of that year under Balakirev 's direction in Saint Petersburg . A second performance followed in March 1866 under the direction of Konstantin Lyadov ( father of composer Anatoly Lyadov ) . 
 Correspondence between Rimsky @-@ Korsakov and Balakirev clearly shows that some ideas for the symphony originated with Balakirev . Balakirev seldom stopped at merely correcting a piece of music , and would often recompose it at the piano . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov recalled , 
 A pupil like myself had to submit to Balakirev a proposed composition in its embryo , say , even the first four or eight bars . Balakirev would immediately make corrections , indicating how to recast such an embryo ; he would criticize it , would praise and extol the first two bars , but would censure the next two , ridicule them , and try hard to make the author disgusted with them . <unk> of composition and fertility were not at all in favor , frequent recasting was demanded , and the composition was extended over a long period of time under the cold control of self @-@ criticism . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov recalled that " Balakirev had no difficulty in getting along with me . At his suggestion I most readily rewrote the symphonic movements composed by me and brought them to completion with the help of his advice and improvisations " . Though Rimsky @-@ Korsakov later found Balakirev 's influence stifling , and broke free from it , this did not stop him in his memoirs from extolling the older composer 's talents as a critic and improviser . Under Balakirev 's mentoring , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov turned to other compositions . He began a symphony in B minor , but felt it too closely followed Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony and abandoned it . He completed an Overture on Three Russian Themes , based on Balakirev 's folksong overtures , as well as a Fantasia on Serbian Themes that was performed at a concert given for the delegates of the Slavonic Congress in 1867 . In his review of this concert , nationalist critic Vladimir Stasov coined the phrase Moguchaya kuchka for the Balakirev circle ( Moguchaya kuchka is usually translated as " The Mighty Handful " or " The Five " ) . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov also composed the initial versions of Sadko and Antar , which cemented his reputation as a writer of orchestral works . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov socialized and discussed music with the other members of The Five ; they critiqued one another 's works in progress and collaborated on new pieces . He became friends with Alexander Borodin , whose music " astonished " him . He spent an increasing amount of time with Mussorgsky . Balakirev and Mussorgsky played piano four @-@ hand music , Mussorgsky would sing , and they frequently discussed other composers ' works , with preferred tastes running " toward Glinka , Schumann and Beethoven 's late quartets " . Mendelssohn was not thought of highly , Mozart and Haydn " were considered out of date and naïve " , and J.S. Bach merely mathematical and unfeeling . Berlioz " was highly esteemed " , Liszt " crippled and perverted from a musical point of view ... even a caricature " , and Wagner discussed little . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov " listened to these opinions with avidity and absorbed the tastes of Balakirev , Cui and Mussorgsky without reasoning or examination " . Often , the musical works in question " were played before me only in fragments , and I had no idea of the whole work " . This , he wrote , did not stop him from accepting these judgments at face value and repeating them " as if I were thoroughly convinced of their truth " . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov became especially appreciated within The Five , and among those who visited the circle , for his talents as an orchestrator . He was asked by Balakirev to orchestrate a Schubert march for a concert in May 1868 , by Cui to orchestrate the opening chorus of his opera William Ratcliff and by Alexander Dargomyzhsky , whose works were greatly appreciated by The Five and who was close to death , to orchestrate his opera The Stone Guest . 
 In the fall of 1871 , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov moved into Voin 's former apartment , and invited Mussorgsky to be his roommate . The working arrangement they agreed upon was that Mussorgsky used the piano in the mornings while Rimsky @-@ Korsakov worked on copying or orchestration . When Mussorgsky left for his civil service job at noon , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov then used the piano . Time in the evenings was allotted by mutual agreement . " That autumn and winter the two of us accomplished a good deal " , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote , " with constant exchange of ideas and plans . Mussorgsky composed and orchestrated the Polish act of Boris Godunov and the folk scene ' Near <unk> . ' I orchestrated and finished my Maid of Pskov . "

 In 1871 , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Rimsky @-@ Korsakov became Professor of Practical Composition and Instrumentation ( orchestration ) at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory , as well as leader of the Orchestra Class . He retained his position in active naval service , and taught his classes in uniform ( military officers in Russia were required to wear their uniforms every day , as they were considered to be always on duty ) . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov explained in his memoirs that <unk> Azanchevsky had taken over that year as director of the Conservatory , and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in those subjects , had offered to pay generously for Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's services . Biographer Mikhail <unk> suggests that Azanchevsky 's motives might have been twofold . First , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents , and inviting him to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there . Second , the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative , Western @-@ based style . Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor , but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's reputation at this time was as a master of orchestration , based on Sadko and Antar . However , he had written these works mainly by intuition . His knowledge of musical theory was elemental ; he had never written any counterpoint , could not harmonize a simple chorale , nor knew the names or intervals of musical chords . He had never conducted an orchestra , and had been discouraged from doing so by the navy , which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform . Aware of his technical shortcomings , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov consulted Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky , with whom he and the others in The Five had been in occasional contact . Tchaikovsky , unlike The Five , had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory , and was serving as Professor of Music Theory at the Moscow Conservatory . Tchaikovsky advised him to study . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote that while teaching at the Conservatory he soon became " possibly its very best pupil [ Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's emphasis ] , judging by the quantity and value of the information it gave me ! " To prepare himself , and to stay at least one step ahead of his students , he took a three @-@ year sabbatical from composing original works , and assiduously studied at home while he lectured at the Conservatory . He taught himself from textbooks , and followed a strict regimen of composing contrapuntal exercises , fugues , chorales and a cappella choruses . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov eventually became an excellent teacher and a fervent believer in academic training . He revised everything he had composed prior to 1874 , even acclaimed works such as Sadko and Antar , in a search for perfection that would remain with him throughout the rest of his life . Assigned to rehearse the Orchestra Class , he mastered the art of conducting . Dealing with orchestral textures as a conductor , and making suitable arrangements of musical works for the Orchestra Class , led to an increased interest in the art of orchestration , an area into which he would further indulge his studies as Inspector of Navy Bands . The score of his Third Symphony , written just after he had completed his three @-@ year program of self @-@ improvement , reflects his hands @-@ on experience with the orchestra . 
 Professorship brought Rimsky @-@ Korsakov financial security , which encouraged him to settle down and to start a family . In December 1871 he proposed to Nadezhda <unk> , with whom he had developed a close relationship over weekly gatherings of The Five at the <unk> household . They married in July 1872 , with Mussorgsky serving as best man . The Rimsky @-@ <unk> had seven children . One of their sons , Andrei , became a musicologist , married the composer Yuliya <unk> and wrote a multi @-@ volume study of his father 's life and work . 
 Nadezhda became a musical as well as domestic partner with her husband , much as Clara Schumann had been with her own husband Robert . She was beautiful , capable , strong @-@ willed , and far better trained musically than her husband at the time they married — she had attended the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in the mid @-@ 1860s , studying piano with Anton Gerke ( one of whose private students was Mussorgsky ) and music theory with Nikolai Zaremba , who also taught Tchaikovsky . Nadezhda proved a fine and most demanding critic of her husband 's work ; her influence over him in musical matters was strong enough for Balakirev and Stasov to wonder whether she was leading him astray from their musical preferences . Musicologist Lyle Neff wrote that while Nadezhda gave up her own compositional career when she married Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , she " had a considerable influence on the creation of [ Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's ] first three operas . She travelled with her husband , attended rehearsals and arranged compositions by him and others " for piano four hands , which she played with her husband . " Her last years were dedicated to issuing her husband 's posthumous literary and musical legacy , maintaining standards for performance of his works ... and preparing material for a museum in his name . " 
 In the spring of 1873 , the navy created the civilian post of Inspector of Naval Bands , with a rank of Collegiate Assessor , and appointed Rimsky @-@ Korsakov . This kept him on the navy payroll and listed on the roster of the Chancellery of the Navy Department but allowed him to resign his commission . The composer commented , " I parted with delight with both my military status and my officer 's uniform " , he later wrote . " Henceforth I was a musician officially and incontestably . " As Inspector , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov applied himself with zeal to his duties . He visited naval bands throughout Russia , supervised the bandmasters and their appointments , reviewed the bands ' repertoire , and inspected the quality of their instruments . He wrote a study program for a complement of music students who held navy fellowships at the Conservatory , and acted as an intermediary between the Conservatory and the navy . He also indulged in a long @-@ standing desire to familiarize himself with the construction and playing technique of orchestral instruments . These studies prompted him to write a textbook on orchestration . He used the privileges of rank to exercise and expand upon his knowledge . He discussed arrangements of musical works for military band with bandmasters , encouraged and reviewed their efforts , held concerts at which he could hear these pieces , and orchestrated original works , and works by other composers , for military bands . 
 In March 1884 , an Imperial Order abolished the navy office of Inspector of Bands , and Rimsky @-@ Korsakov was relieved of his duties . He worked under Balakirev in the Court Chapel as a deputy until 1894 , which allowed him to study Russian Orthodox church music . He also taught classes at the Chapel , and wrote his textbook on harmony for use there and at the Conservatory . 
 = = = Backlash and May Night = = = 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's studies and his change in attitude regarding music education brought him the scorn of his fellow nationalists , who thought he was throwing away his Russian heritage to compose fugues and sonatas . After he strove " to crowd in as much counterpoint as possible " into his Third Symphony , he wrote chamber works adhering strictly to classical models , including a string sextet , a string quartet in F minor and a quintet for flute , clarinet , horn , bassoon and piano . About the quartet and the symphony , Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness , Nadezhda von Meck , that they " were filled with a host of clever things but ... [ were ] imbued with a dryly pedantic character " . Borodin commented that when he heard the symphony , he kept " feeling that this is the work of a German Herr Professor who has put on his glasses and is about to write Eine <unk> Symphonie in C " . 
 According to Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , the other members of The Five showed little enthusiasm for the symphony , and less still for the quartet . Nor was his public debut as a conductor , at an 1874 charity concert where he led the orchestra in the new symphony , considered favorably by his compatriots . He later wrote that " they began , indeed , to look down upon me as one on the downward path " . Worse still to Rimsky @-@ Korsakov was the faint praise given by Anton Rubinstein , a composer opposed to the nationalists ' music and philosophy . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote that after Rubinstein heard the quartet , he commented that now Rimsky @-@ Korsakov " might amount to something " as a composer . He wrote that Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally , telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky @-@ Korsakov was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character . Privately , Tchaikovsky confided to Nadezhda von Meck , " Apparently [ Rimsky @-@ Korsakov ] is now passing through this crisis , and how it will end will be difficult to predict . Either a great master will come out of him , or he will finally become bogged down in contrapuntal tricks " . 
 Two projects helped Rimsky @-@ Korsakov focus on less academic music @-@ making . The first was the creation of two folk song collections in 1874 . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov transcribed 40 Russian songs for voice and piano from performances by folk singer <unk> <unk> , who approached him at Balakirev 's suggestion . This collection was followed by a second containing 100 songs , supplied by friends and servants , or taken from rare and out @-@ of @-@ print collections . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov later credited this work as a great influence on him as a composer ; it also supplied a vast amount of musical material from which he could draw for future projects , either by direct quotation or as models for composing <unk> passages . The second project was the editing of orchestral scores by pioneer Russian composer Mikhail Glinka ( 1804 – 1857 ) in collaboration with Balakirev and Anatoly Lyadov . Glinka 's sister , Lyudmila Ivanovna <unk> , wanted to preserve her brother 's musical legacy in print , and paid the costs of the project from her own pocket . No similar project had been attempted before in Russian music , and guidelines for scholarly musical editing had to be established and agreed . While Balakirev favored making changes in Glinka 's music to " correct " what he saw as compositional flaws , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov favored a less intrusive approach . Eventually , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov prevailed . " Work on Glinka 's scores was an unexpected schooling for me " , he later wrote . " Even before this I had known and worshipped his operas ; but as editor of the scores in print I had to go through Glinka 's style and instrumentation to their last little note ... And this was a beneficent discipline for me , leading me as it did to the path of modern music , after my vicissitudes with counterpoint and strict style " . 
 In the summer of 1877 , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov thought increasingly about the short story May Night by Nikolai Gogol . The story had long been a favorite of his , and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal , when they had read it together . While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877 , now they came with greater persistence . By winter May Night took an increasing amount of his attention ; in February 1878 he started writing in earnest , and he finished the opera by early November . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote that May Night was of great importance because , despite the opera 's containing a good deal of contrapuntal music , he nevertheless " cast off the shackles of counterpoint [ emphasis Rimsky @-@ Korsakov ] " . He wrote the opera in a folk @-@ like melodic idiom , and scored it in a transparent manner much in the style of Glinka . Nevertheless , despite the ease of writing this opera and the next , The Snow Maiden , from time to time he suffered from creative paralysis between 1881 and 1888 . He kept busy during this time by editing Mussorgsky 's works and completing Borodin 's Prince Igor ( Mussorgsky died in 1881 , Borodin in 1887 ) . 
 = = = Belyayev circle = = = 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote that he became acquainted with budding music patron Mitrofan Belyayev ( M. P. <unk> ) in Moscow in 1882 . Belyayev was one of a growing coterie of Russian nouveau @-@ riche industrialists who became patrons of the arts in mid- to late @-@ 19th century Russia ; their number included railway magnate Savva Mamontov and textile manufacturer Pavel Tretyakov . Belyayev , Mamontov and Tretyakov " wanted to contribute conspicuously to public life " . They had worked their way into wealth , and being <unk> in their national outlook believed in the greater glory of Russia . Because of this belief , they were more likely than the aristocracy to support native talent , and were more inclined to support nationalist artists over cosmopolitan ones . This preference paralleled a general upsurge in nationalism and Russophilia that became prevalent in mainstream Russian art and society . 
 By the winter of 1883 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov had become a regular visitor to the weekly " quartet Fridays " ( " Les <unk> " ) held at Belyayev 's home in Saint Petersburg . Belyayev , who had already taken a keen interest in the musical future of the teenage Alexander Glazunov , rented a hall and hired an orchestra in 1884 to play Glazunov 's First Symphony plus an orchestral suite Glazunov had just composed . This concert and a rehearsal the previous year gave Rimsky @-@ Korsakov the idea of offering concerts featuring Russian compositions , a prospect to which Belyayev was amenable . The Russian Symphony Concerts were inaugurated during the 1886 – 87 season , with Rimsky @-@ Korsakov sharing conducting duties with Anatoly Lyadov . He finished his revision of Mussorgsky 's Night on Bald Mountain and conducted it at the opening concert . The concerts also coaxed him out of his creative drought ; he wrote Scheherazade , Capriccio Espagnol and the Russian Easter Overture specifically for them . He noted that these three works " show a considerable falling off in the use of contrapuntal devices ... [ replaced ] by a strong and virtuoso development of every kind of figuration which sustains the technical interest of my compositions . " 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov was asked for advice and guidance not just on the Russian Symphony Concerts , but on other projects through which Belyayev aided Russian composers . " By force of matters purely musical I turned out to be the head of the Belyayev circle " , he wrote . " As the head Belyayev , too , considered me , consulting me about everything and referring everyone to me as chief " . In 1884 Belyayev set up an annual Glinka prize , and in 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm , through which he published works by Borodin , Glazunov , Lyadov and Rimsky @-@ Korsakov at his own expense . To select which composers to assist with money , publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help , Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov , Lyadov and Rimsky @-@ Korsakov . They would look through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention . 
 The group of composers who now congregated with Glazunov , Lyadov and Rimsky @-@ Korsakov became known as the Belyayev circle , named after their financial benefactor . These composers were nationalistic in their musical outlook , as The Five before them had been . Like The Five , they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic , harmonic and rhythmic elements , as exemplified by the music of Balakirev , Borodin and Rimsky @-@ Korsakov . Unlike The Five , these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic , Western @-@ based background in composition — which Rimsky @-@ Korsakov had instilled in his years at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory . Compared to the " revolutionary " composers in Balakirev 's circle , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be " progressive ... attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection , but ... also broke new paths , though more securely , even if less speedily ... " 
 = = = Increased contact with Tchaikovsky = = = 
 In November 1887 , Tchaikovsky arrived in Saint Petersburg in time to hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts . One of them included the first complete performance of his First Symphony , subtitled Winter Daydreams , in its final version . Another concert featured the premiere of Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's Third Symphony in its revised version . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov and Tchaikovsky corresponded considerably before the visit and spent a lot of time together , along with Glazunov and Lyadov . Though Tchaikovsky had been a regular visitor to the Rimsky @-@ Korsakov home since 1876 , and had at one point offered to arrange Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's appointment as director of the Moscow Conservatory , this was the beginning of closer relations between the two . Within a couple of years , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote , Tchaikovsky 's visits became more frequent . 
 During these visits and especially in public , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wore a mask of geniality . Privately , he found the situation emotionally complex , and confessed his fears to his friend , the Moscow critic Semyon Kruglikov . Memories persisted of the tension between Tchaikovsky and The Five over the differences in their musical philosophies — tension acute enough for Tchaikovsky 's brother Modest to liken their relations at that time to " those between two friendly neighboring states ... cautiously prepared to meet on common ground , but jealously guarding their separate interests " . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov observed , not without annoyance , how Tchaikovsky became increasingly popular among Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's followers . This personal jealousy was compounded by a professional one , as Tchaikovsky 's music became increasingly popular among the composers of the Belyayev circle , and remained on the whole more famous than his own . Even so , when Tchaikovsky attended Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's <unk> party in May 1893 , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov asked Tchaikovsky personally if he would conduct four concerts of the Russian Musical Society in Saint Petersburg the following season . After hesitation , Tchaikovsky agreed . While his sudden death in late 1893 prevented him from fulfilling this commitment in its entirety , the list of works he had planned to conduct included Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's Third Symphony . 
 = = = Increasing conservatism ; second creative drought = = = 
 In March 1889 , Angelo Neumann 's traveling " Richard Wagner Theater " visited Saint Petersburg , giving four cycles of Der Ring des Nibelungen there under the direction of Karl Muck . The Five had ignored Wagner 's music , but The Ring impressed Rimsky @-@ Korsakov : he was astonished with Wagner 's mastery of orchestration . He attended the rehearsals with Glazunov , and followed the score . After hearing these performances , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov devoted himself almost exclusively to composing operas for the rest of his creative life . Wagner 's use of the orchestra influenced Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's orchestration , beginning with the arrangement of the polonaise from Mussorgsky 's Boris Godunov that he made for concert use in 1889 . 
 Toward music more adventurous than Wagner 's , especially that of Richard Strauss and later Claude Debussy , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's mind remained closed . He would fume for days afterwards when he heard pianist Felix Blumenfeld play Debussy 's <unk> and write in his diary about them , " Poor and skimpy to the nth degree ; there is no technique , even less imagination . " This was part of an increasing musical conservatism on his part ( his " musical conscience , " as he put it ) , under which he now scrutinized his music and that of others ' , as well . Compositions by his former compatriots in The Five were not immune . While working on his first revision of Mussorgsky 's Boris Godunov , in 1895 he would tell his amanuensis , Vasily <unk> , " It 's incredible that I ever could have liked this music and yet it seems there was such a time . " By 1901 he would write of growing " indignant at all [ of Wagner 's ] blunders of the ear " — this about the same music which caught his attention in 1889 . 
 In 1892 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov suffered a second creative drought , brought on by bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms . Rushes of blood to the head , confusion , memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led to a medical diagnosis of neurasthenia . Crises in the Rimsky @-@ Korsakov household may have been a factor — the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890 , the deaths of his mother and youngest child , as well as the onset of the prolonged , ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child . He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently . After making third versions of the musical tableau Sadko and the opera The Maid of Pskov , he closed his musical account with the past ; he had left none of his major works before May Night in their original form . 
 Another death brought about a creative renewal . The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity — to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol 's short story Christmas Eve , a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith . The success of Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's Christmas Eve encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908 — a total of 11 during this period . He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration , but made a third attempt and almost finished it in the last four years of his life . ( His son @-@ in @-@ law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912 . ) Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's scientific treatment of orchestration , illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work , set a new standard for texts of its kind . 
 = = = 1905 Revolution = = = 
 In 1905 , demonstrations took place in the St. Petersburg Conservatory as part of the 1905 Revolution ; these , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote , were triggered by similar disturbances at St. Petersburg State University , in which students demanded political reforms and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in Russia . " I was chosen a member of the committee for adjusting differences with agitated pupils " , he recalled ; however , almost as soon as the committee had been formed , " [ a ] ll sorts of measures were recommended to expel the ringleaders , to quarter the police in the Conservatory , to close the Conservatory entirely " . 
 A lifelong liberal politically , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote that he felt someone had to protect the rights of the students to demonstrate , especially as disputes and wrangling between students and authorities were becoming increasingly violent . In an open letter , he sided with the students against what he saw as unwarranted interference by Conservatory leadership and the Russian Musical Society . A second letter , this time signed by a number of faculty including Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , demanded the resignation of the head of the Conservatory . Partly as a result of these two letters he wrote , approximately 100 Conservatory students were expelled and he was removed from his professorship . Just before the dismissal was enacted , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov received a letter from one of the members of the school directorate , suggesting that he take up the directorship in the interest of calming student unrest . " Probably the member of the Directorate held a minority opinion , but signed the resolution nevertheless , " he wrote . " I sent a negative reply . " Partly in defiance of his dismissal , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov continued teaching his students from his home . 
 Not long after Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's dismissal , a student production of his opera <unk> the Deathless was followed not with the scheduled concert but with a political demonstration , which led to a police ban on Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's work . Due in part to widespread press coverage of these events , an immediate wave of outrage against the ban arose throughout Russia and abroad ; liberals and intellectuals deluged the composer 's residence with letters of sympathy , and even peasants who had not heard a note of Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's music sent small monetary donations . Several faculty members of the St. Petersburg Conservatory resigned in protest , including Glazunov and Lyadov . Eventually , over 300 students walked out of the Conservatory in solidarity with Rimsky @-@ Korsakov . By December he had been reinstated under a new director , Glazunov ; Rimsky @-@ Korsakov retired from the Conservatory in 1906 . The political controversy continued with his opera The Golden Cockerel . Its implied criticism of monarchy , Russian imperialism and the Russo @-@ Japanese War gave it little chance of passing the censors . The premiere was delayed until 1909 , after Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's death , and even then it was performed in an adapted version . 
 In April 1907 , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov conducted a pair of concerts in Paris , hosted by impresario Sergei Diaghilev , which featured music of the Russian nationalist school . The concerts were hugely successful in popularizing Russian classical music of this kind in Europe , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's in particular . The following year , his opera Sadko was produced at the Paris Opéra and The Snow Maiden at the Opéra @-@ Comique . He also had the opportunity to hear more recent music by European composers . He hissed unabashedly when he heard Richard Strauss 's opera Salome , and told Diaghilev after hearing Claude Debussy 's opera Pelléas et Mélisande , " Don 't make me listen to all these horrors or I shall end up liking them ! " Hearing these works led him to appreciate his place in the world of classical music . He admitted that he was a " convinced <unk> " ( after kuchka , the shortened Russian term for The Five ) and that his works belonged to an era that musical trends had left behind . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Beginning around 1890 , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov suffered from angina . While this ailment initially wore him down gradually , the stresses concurrent with the 1905 Revolution and its aftermath greatly accelerated its progress . After December 1907 , his illness became severe , and he could not work . In 1908 he died at his <unk> estate near Luga ( modern day <unk> District of Pskov Oblast ) , and was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg , next to Borodin , Glinka , Mussorgsky and Stasov . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 = = = Compositions = = = 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov followed the musical ideals espoused by The Five . He employed Orthodox liturgical themes in the Russian Easter Festival Overture , folk song in Capriccio Espagnol and orientalism in Scheherazade , possibly his best known work . He proved a prolific composer but also a perpetually self @-@ critical one . He revised every orchestral work up to and including his Third Symphony — some , like Antar and Sadko , more than once . These revisions range from minor changes of tempo , phrasing and instrumental detail to wholesale transposition and complete recomposition . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov was open about the influences in his music , telling Vasily <unk> , " Study Liszt and Balakirev more closely , and you 'll see that a great deal in me is not mine " . He followed Balakirev in his use of the whole tone scale , treatment of folk songs and musical orientalism and Liszt for harmonic adventurousness . ( The violin melody used to portray Scheherazade is very closely related to its counterpart in Balakirev 's symphonic poem Tamara , while the Russian Easter Overtures follows the design and plan of Balakirev 's Second Overture on Russian Themes . ) Nevertheless , while he took Glinka and Liszt as his harmonic models , his use of whole tone and octatonic scales do demonstrate his originality . He developed both these compositional devices for the " fantastic " sections of his operas , which depicted magical or supernatural characters and events . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov maintained an interest in harmonic experiments and continued exploring new idioms throughout his career . However , he tempered this interest with an abhorrence of excess and kept his tendency to experiment under constant control . The more radical his harmonies became , the more he attempted to control them with strict rules — applying his " musical conscience " , as he called it . In this sense , he was both a progressive and a conservative composer . The whole tone and octatonic scales were both considered adventurous in the Western classical tradition , and Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's use of them made his harmonies seem radical . Conversely , his care about how or when in a composition he used these scales made him seem conservative compared with later composers like Igor Stravinsky , though they were often building on Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's work . 
 = = = = Operas = = = = 
 While Rimsky @-@ Korsakov is best known in the West for his orchestral works , his operas are more complex , offering a wider variety of orchestral effects than in his instrumental works and fine vocal writing . Excerpts and suites from them have proved as popular in the West as the purely orchestral works . The best @-@ known of these excerpts is probably " Flight of the Bumblebee " from The Tale of Tsar Saltan , which has often been heard by itself in orchestral programs , and in countless arrangements and transcriptions , most famously in a piano version made by Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff . Other selections familiar to listeners in the West are " Dance of the <unk> " from The Snow Maiden , " Procession of the Nobles " from Mlada , and " Song of the Indian Guest " ( or , less accurately , " Song of India " ) from Sadko , as well as suites from The Golden Cockerel and The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden <unk> . 
 The Operas fall into three categories : 
 Historical drama : The Maid of Pskov , and its prologue The <unk> Vera <unk> , Mozart and Salieri , The Tsar 's Bride , Pan Voyevoda , <unk> 
 Folk operas : May Night , Christmas Eve 
 Fairy tales and legends : The Snow Maiden , Mlada , Sadko , <unk> the Deathless , The Tale of Tsar Saltan , The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden <unk> , The Golden Cockerel 
 Of this range Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote in 1902 , " In every new work of mine I am trying to do something that is new for me . On the one hand , I am pushed on by the thought that in this way , [ my music ] will retain freshness and interest , but at the same time I am prompted by my pride to think that many facets , devices , moods and styles , if not all , should be within my reach . " 
 American music critic and journalist Harold C. Schonberg wrote that the operas " open up a delightful new world , the world of the Russian East , the world of supernaturalism and the exotic , the world of Slavic pantheism and vanished races . Genuine poetry suffuses them , and they are scored with brilliance and resource . " According to some critics Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's music in these works lacks dramatic power , a seemingly fatal flaw in an operatic composer . This may have been conscious , as he repeatedly stated in his writing that he felt operas were first and foremost musical works rather than mainly dramatic ones . Ironically , the operas succeed dramatically in most cases by being deliberately non @-@ theatrical . 
 = = = = Orchestral works = = = = 
 The purely orchestral works fall into two categories . The best @-@ known ones in the West , and perhaps the finest in overall quality , are mainly programmatic in nature — in other words , the musical content and how it is handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story , the action in a painting or events reported through another non @-@ musical source . The second category of works are more academic , such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta . In these , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition . 
 Program music came naturally to Rimsky @-@ Korsakov . To him , " even a folk theme has a program of sorts . " He composed the majority of his orchestral works in this genre at two periods of his career — at the beginning , with Sadko and Antar ( also known as his Second Symphony , Op. 9 ) , and in the 1880s , with Scheherezade , Capriccio Espagnol and the Russian Easter Overture . Despite the gap between these two periods , the composer 's overall approach and the way he used his musical themes remained consistent . Both Antar and Scheherezade use a robust " Russian " theme to portray the male <unk> ( the title character in Antar ; the sultan in Scheherezade ) and a more sinuous " Eastern " theme for the female ones ( the peri Gul @-@ Nazar in Antar and the title character in Scheherezade ) . 
 Where Rimsky @-@ Korsakov changed between these two sets of works was in orchestration . While his pieces were always celebrated for their imaginative use of instrumental forces , the sparser textures of Sadko and Antar pale compared to the luxuriance of the more popular works of the 1880s . While a principle of highlighting " primary hues " of instrumental color remained in place , it was augmented in the later works by a sophisticated cachet of orchestral effects , some gleaned from other composers including Wagner , but many invented by himself . As a result , these works resemble brightly colored mosaics , striking in their own right and often scored with a juxtaposition of pure orchestral groups . The final tutti of Scheherazade is a prime example of this scoring . The theme is assigned to trombones playing in unison , and is accompanied by a combination of string patterns . Meanwhile , another pattern alternates with chromatic scales in the woodwinds and a third pattern of rhythms is played by percussion . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's non @-@ program music , though well @-@ crafted , does not rise to the same level of inspiration as his programmatic works ; he needed fantasy to bring out the best in him . The First Symphony follows the outlines of Schumann 's Fourth extremely closely , and is slighter in its thematic material than his later compositions . The Third Symphony and Sinfonietta each contain a series of variations on less @-@ than @-@ the @-@ best music that can lead to tedium . 
 = = = = Smaller @-@ scale works = = = = 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov composed dozens of art songs , arrangements of folk songs , chamber and piano music . While the piano music is relatively unimportant , many of the art songs possess a delicate beauty . While they yield in <unk> lyricism to Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff , otherwise they reserve their place in the standard repertory of Russian singers . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov also wrote a body of choral works , both secular and for Russian Orthodox Church service . The latter include settings of portions of the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom . 
 = = = Transitional figure = = = 
 Critic Vladimir Stasov , who along with Balakirev had founded The Five , wrote in 1882 , " Beginning with Glinka , all the best Russian musicians have been very skeptical of book learning and have never approached it with the servility and the superstitious reverence with which it is approached to this day in many parts of Europe . " This statement was not true for Glinka , who studied Western music theory assiduously with Siegfried Dehn in Berlin before he composed his opera A Life for the Tsar However , it was true for Balakirev , who " opposed academicism with tremendous vigor , " and it was true initially for Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , who had been imbued by Balakirev and Stasov with the same attitude . 
 One point Stasov omitted purposely , which would have disproved his statement completely , was that at the time he wrote it , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov had been pouring his " book learning " into students at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory for over a decade . Beginning with his three years of self @-@ imposed study , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov had drawn closer to Tchaikovsky and further away from the rest of The Five , while the rest of The Five had drawn back from him and Stasov had branded him a " renegade . " Taruskin writes , " The older he became , the greater was the irony with which Rimsky @-@ Korsakov looked back on his <unk> days . " When the young Semyon Kruglikov was considering a future in composition , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote the future critic , 
 About a talent for composition ... I can say nothing as yet . You have tried your powers too little .... Yes , one can study on one 's own . Sometimes one needs advice , but one must study ... All of us , that is , I myself and Borodin , and Balakirev , and especially Cui and Mussorgsky , did disdain these things . I consider myself lucky that I <unk> myself in time and forced myself to work . As for Balakirev , owing to his insufficient technique he writes little ; Borodin , with difficulty ; Cui , carelessly ; and Mussorgsky , sloppily and often incoherently . " 
 Taruskin points out this statement , which Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote while Borodin and Mussorgsky were still alive , as proof of his estrangement from the rest of The Five and an indication of the kind of teacher he eventually became . By the time he instructed <unk> and Glazunov , " their training hardly differed from [ Tchaikovsky 's ] . An ideal of the strictest professionalism was instilled in them from the beginning . " By the time Borodin died in 1887 , the era of <unk> for Russian composers had effectively ended . Every Russian who aspired to write classical music attended a conservatory and received the same formal education . " There was no more ' Moscow , ' no ' St. Petersburg . ' " Taruskin writes ; " at last all Russia was one . Moreover , by century 's end , the theory and composition faculties of Rubinstein 's Conservatory were entirely in the hands of representatives of the New Russian School . Viewed against the background of Stasov 's predictions , there could scarcely be any greater irony . " 
 = = = Students = = = 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov taught theory and composition to 250 students over his 35 @-@ year tenure at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory , " enough to people a whole ' school ' of composers . " This does not include pupils at the two other schools where he taught , including Glazunov , or those he taught privately at his home , such as Igor Stravinsky . Apart from Glazunov and Stravinsky , students who later found fame included Anatoly Lyadov , Alexander <unk> , Sergei Prokofiev , Ottorino Respighi , Witold Maliszewski , Mykola Lysenko , Artur Kapp , and Konstanty Gorski . Other students included the music critic and musicologist Alexander Ossovsky , and the composer Lazare <unk> . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov felt talented students needed little formal dictated instruction . His teaching method included distinct steps : show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint ; direct them in understanding the forms of composition ; give them a year or two of systematic study in the development of technique , exercises in free composition and orchestration ; instill a good knowledge of the piano . Once these were properly completed , studies would be over . He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes . Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky @-@ Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying , " I will speak , and you will listen . Then I will speak less , and you will start to work . And finally I will not speak at all , and you will work . " Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern . " Rimsky @-@ Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had to do was to do our work well . " 
 = = = Editing the work of The Five = = = 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's editing of works by The Five is significant . It was a practical extension of the collaborative atmosphere of The Five during the 1860s and 1870s , when they heard each other 's compositions in progress and worked on them together , and was an effort to save works that would otherwise either have languished unheard or become lost entirely . This work included the completion of Alexander Borodin 's opera Prince Igor , which Rimsky @-@ Korsakov undertook with the help of Glazunov after Borodin 's death , and the orchestration of passages from César Cui 's William Ratcliff for its first production in 1869 . He also completely orchestrated the opera The Stone Guest by Alexander Dargomyzhsky three times — in 1869 – 70 , 1892 and 1902 . While not a member of The Five himself , Dargomyzhsky was closely associated with the group and shared their musical philosophy . 
 Musicologist Francis Maes wrote that while Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's efforts are laudable , they are also controversial . It was generally assumed that with Prince Igor , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov edited and orchestrated the existing fragments of the opera while Glazunov composed and added missing parts , including most of the third act and the overture . This was exactly what Rimsky @-@ Korsakov stated in his memoirs . However , both Maes and Richard Taruskin cite an analysis of Borodin 's manuscripts by musicologist Pavel Lamm , which showed that Rimsky @-@ Korsakov and Glazunov discarded nearly 20 percent of Borodin 's score . According to Maes , the result is more a collaborative effort by all three composers than a true representation of Borodin 's intent . Lamm stated that because of the extremely chaotic state of Borodin 's manuscripts , a modern alternative to Rimsky @-@ Korsakov and Glazunov 's edition would be extremely difficult to complete . 
 More debatable , according to Maes , is Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's editing of Mussorgsky 's works . After Mussorgsky 's death in 1881 , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov revised and completed several of Mussorgsky 's works for publication and performance , helping to spread Mussorgsky 's works throughout Russia and to the West . However Maes , in reviewing Mussorgsky 's scores , wrote that Rimsky @-@ Korsakov allowed his " musical conscience " to dictate his editing , and he changed or removed what he considered musical over @-@ experimentation or poor form . Because of this , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov has been accused of pedantry in " correcting " , among other things , matters of harmony . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov may have foreseen questions over his efforts when he wrote , 
 If Mussorgsky 's compositions are destined to live <unk> for fifty years after their author 's death ( when all his works will become the property of any and every publisher ) , such an archeologically accurate edition will always be possible , as the manuscripts went to the Public Library on leaving me . For the present , though , there was need of an edition for performances , for practical artistic purposes , for making his colossal talent known , and not for the mere studying of his personality and artistic sins . 
 Maes stated that time proved Rimsky @-@ Korsakov correct when it came to posterity 's re @-@ evaluation of Mussorgsky 's work . Mussorgsky 's musical style , once considered unpolished , is now admired for its originality . While Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's arrangement of Night on Bald Mountain is still the version generally performed , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's other revisions , like his version of Boris Godunov , have been replaced by Mussorgsky 's original .

 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov may have saved the most personal side of his creativity for his approach to Russian folklore . <unk> as practiced by Balakirev and the other members of The Five had been based largely on the <unk> dance song . <unk> literally meant " drawn @-@ out song " , or <unk> elaborated lyric song . The characteristics of this song exhibit extreme rhythmic flexibility , an asymmetrical phrase structure and tonal ambiguity . After composing May Night , however , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov was increasingly drawn to " calendar songs " , which were written for specific ritual occasions . The ties to folk culture was what interested him most in folk music , even in his days with The Five ; these songs formed a part of rural customs , echoed old Slavic paganism , and the pantheistic world of folk rites . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote that his interest in these songs was heightened by his study of them while compiling his folk song collections . He wrote that he " was captivated by the poetic side of the cult of sun @-@ worship , and sought its survivals and echoes in both the tunes and the words of the songs . The pictures of the ancient pagan period and spirit loomed before me , as it then seemed , with great clarity , luring me on with the charm of antiquity . These occupations subsequently had a great influence in the direction of my own activity as a composer " . 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's interest in pantheism was whetted by the <unk> studies of Alexander Afanasyev . That author 's standard work , The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs , became Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's pantheistic bible . The composer first applied Afanasyev 's ideas in May Night , in which he helped fill out Gogol 's story by using folk dances and calendar songs . He went further down this path in The Snow Maiden , where he made extensive use of seasonal calendar songs and <unk> ( ceremonial dances ) in the folk tradition . 
 Musicologists and <unk> have long recognized that Rimsky @-@ Korsakov was a pantheistic and ecumenical artist whose folklore @-@ inspired operas take up such issues as the relationship between paganism and Christianity and the seventeenth @-@ century schism in the Orthodox Church . At heart he held pantheistic beliefs , often mistaken for a form of atheism , which had its most visible manifestation in his deep reverence of folk culture , especially pantheistic rites .

 = Abergil crime family = 
 The Abergil crime family ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> אברג 'יל ) is a Moroccan @-@ Jewish crime organization based in Israel , and located around the world , founded by Ya 'akov Abergil . The group was headed by Ya 'akov Abergil ( Hebrew : <unk> אברג 'יל ) until his death in 2002 , and is now run under the auspices of Itzhak ( <unk> ) Abergil ( Hebrew : <unk> ( <unk> ) אברג 'יל ) , and his brothers Meir Abergil ( Hebrew : <unk> אברג 'יל ) and Avraham ( <unk> ) Abergil ( Hebrew : <unk> אברג 'יל ) . Its illicit activities include drug trafficking , both in Israel and the US , murder , extortion , embezzlement , money laundering , the control of illegal casinos and other crimes . Considered one of the six major organized @-@ crime cells in Israel , and one of the world ’ s top 40 biggest drug importers to the United States , the Abergils have been arrested and detained multiple times worldwide . 
 Avraham Abergil is currently incarcerated on a slew of drug and attempted murder charges . On January 12 , 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil and three associates were extradited to the United States . In a 77 @-@ page 32 @-@ count indictment filed on July 13 , 2008 at federal court in Los Angeles , the Abergil family is considered one of the most powerful crime families in Israel , deriving that power , in part , “ because of its propensity for violence in Israel and around the world . ” They were charged with murder , laundering millions of dollars obtained from embezzlement at Israel Trade Bank , extortion of business people , and operating an ecstasy @-@ distribution network for millions of ecstasy pills . The Abergils and their three associates have denied all charges . According to Israeli police sources , their crime organization has continued to operate in Israel after their extradition . 
 In August 2011 , Meir Abergil returned to Israel after a California court had approved a plea agreement setting him free . In May 2012 , Itzhak Abergil was sentenced by a Los Angeles federal court to 10 years in prison with credit for time served , after pleading guilty to being part of a racketeering enterprise that distributed Ecstasy and whose members killed a man for stealing a large drug shipment . He is to serve the remaining eight and a half years time in Israel .

 According to the indictment , the crime organization headed by Itzhak and Meir Abergil ran a flourishing money @-@ laundering business in the US from 2002 to 2006 , processing tens of millions of dollars of funds embezzled from the Israel Trade Bank , through the “ Jerusalem Gang ′ s ” extortion of Ofer <unk> , that led to his sister <unk> Alon ′ s embezzling 250 million <unk> . The money was given out as loans to Israeli businesspeople in the United States , who were later extorted to give up their businesses if they did not pay up . Meir Abergil , described as the person in charge of finances , collected the money that was exacted and later laundered and invested it . Gabi Ben Harosh of the “ Jerusalem Gang ” who was arrested in Los Angeles in 2004 , ran the lending bank in the United States and updated Meir and Itzhak Abergil on its balance . Sasson <unk> of Jerusalem and Hai Vaknin of Los Angeles identified borrowers and businesses and also saw to the collection of the money . Yoram <unk> , who has fled to Brazil , was responsible for special @-@ operations . The activities have been documented in hundreds of surveillance reports , photographs and phone calls , which were recorded by police departments all over the world and are detailed in the indictment .

 The US State Department considers the Abergils as one of the world ’ s top 40 drug importers to the US . US federal prosecutors claim that when the Abergils wished to expand their mob syndicate in the US , they turned for help to an upstart Latino street gang known as the Vineland Boyz . The Boyz ' feud with the Mexican Mafia , known as " La <unk> " , sent the Boyz looking for a new source of drugs , which the Israelis provided . The Abergils , along with Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa , are also charged with smuggling cocaine and hashish from Europe to the United States . 
 On July 22 , 2002 , the Los Angeles Police busted a meeting of ecstasy dealers in the midst of a drug and money exchange , confiscating over 400 @,@ 000 tablets of the drug , valued at more than $ 5 million . According to the LAPD , Moshe Malul was the person behind the distribution of millions of ecstasy tablets in Southern California and Itzhak Abergil the person responsible for the ecstasy shipments from Belgium and the Netherlands . 
 In May 2008 , a court in Antwerp , Belgium sentenced Itzhak Abergil along with eight other accomplices to a firm 5 @-@ year prison term for his involvement in large scale drug trafficking through the city of Antwerp ′ s port .

 In June 2002 Yaakov Abergil , the eldest of the brothers was murdered in front of his family . After his death , the leadership passed on to his brother Itzhak , who has accumulated a number of powerful enemies and survived several assassination attempts . In December 2002 , one of Abergil 's main rivals , underworld kingpin Ze 'ev Rosenstein , was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to assassinate both Abergils . In 2007 , Police learned that at least two contract killers , believed to be from the Commonwealth of Independent States , had come to Israel at the behest of a rival crime family embroiled in a vendetta with the Abergil crime syndicate . The police believed the two hit men to be hired by the competing Alperon crime family . 
 = = = Murders and assassinations = = = 
 The Abergils have been accused of number of murders and assassinations . 
 On August 31 , 2003 , Sami Atias , an Israeli drug dealer who had belonged to an ecstasy ring headed by Abergil and Moshe Malul , was shot at close range and killed in the parking lot of an Encino café as he was getting into his car . Allegedly he had tried to steal 76 kilograms of Ecstasy in 2002 . According to the indictment , Moshe Malul and fugitive Vineland Boyz ′ member Luis Sandoval , were at the scene when Atias was shot , but another man had pulled the trigger . Itzhak Abergil had offered to help with the slaying during a meeting in Spain , but he did not play a direct role in the killing . 
 On October 5 , 2008 , Amir <unk> and Eitan <unk> , two suspected associates of the Abergil crime family , were acquitted of a charge of grievous bodily harm by a Tel Aviv District Court , instead being convicted of lesser crimes , due to police negligence in collecting evidence . The charge sheet had claimed that the suspects had planned to kill Nissim Alperon , brother of crime boss Yaakov Alperon in retaliation for an attack on Itzhak Abergil said to be carried out by the <unk> five months earlier . On November 2008 , Yaakov Alperon was killed in a car blast in Tel Aviv . 
 In 2005 , two girls were killed in Ramle by shots fired at a hall where Itzhak Abergil was celebrating . Police believe the slain girls were innocent victims of a mistake by the attacker in identifying his true target . 
 In August 2008 31 @-@ year @-@ old social worker Margarita Lautin ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> ) , from Yehud , was killed while dining on the Bat Yam boardwalk with her husband and two young children . The targets of the shooting , attempting to run away from the shooters , had created a clear line of fire on Lautin , who was shot in the chest . The two suspected assassins , Ronen Ben @-@ Adi and Shimon Sabah , members of the Abergil mob , fled the scene on a motorcycle , but were later apprehended by the police . They were convicted in May 2010 , Sabah was sentenced to prison for seven years , and Ben Adi to life in prison and required to pay Lautin 's daughters NIS 350 @,@ 000 in compensation . 
 The assailants were apparently targeting Rami Amira , who was sitting at a table nearby with Moti Hassin and <unk> <unk> , who are all identified with the Abergil group , in an effort to resolve an internal dispute . Amira sustained a slight injury in his cheek as a result of the attack . He was killed on 2 February 2011 in Rishon <unk> , presumably by the Abergil organization which , according to police sources , continued to operate while the two Abergil brothers were extradited and awaiting trial in the United States . 
 = = Arrests and extradition = = 
 In 2004 , Gabi Ben Harosh , partner of the Abergil brothers , was arrested in Los Angeles . After two years of house arrest , he signed a plea bargain for minor offenses , connected to bringing in foreign currency without a permit , and was sentenced to community service and judicial supervision for three years . In view of the Abergil brothers extradition to the US , he and his wife were arrested for violating immigration laws . It is believed that American authorities tried to apply pressure to Ben Harosh to incriminate the Abergil brothers but failed . 
 Hai Vaknin , called an “ Abergil henchman ” by the Israeli daily Haaretz , was arrested in the USA in 2006 . In January 2011 , he signed a plea bargain , confessing to money laundering and receiving a 57 @-@ month jail sentence , which he had already served , and was ordered to serve three years under supervised release . His description of loans and extortion practices was expected to help convict Itzhak and Meir Abergil . 
 In early August 2008 , Itzhak and Meir Abergil were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murder of Margarita Lautin who had died after being mistakenly shot during a failed assassination attempt by members of the Abergil mob . 
 On August 26 , 2008 Itzhak and Meir Abergil along with Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa were brought before a Jerusalem Magistrate ′ s Court judge for their alleged role in the killing of Israeli drug dealer Sami Atias in Encino in August 2003 , as a revenge for his allegedly having stolen money from them . They were remanded in custody together with <unk> <unk> as a result of a request by law enforcement in the United States for their extradition . The indictment includes four different crimes that are attributed to Yitzhak Abergil : involvement together with Malul in the murder of Atias in California in 2003 , trade in Ecstasy , extortion and violence against businessmen , and money laundering and fraud . The inquiry into the case had lasted for six years , involving the FBI , tax authorities and law enforcement officials in more than ten countries in America , Europe , Asia and the Middle East . 
 In July 2009 , a Jerusalem District Court approved the state ’ s request to extradite the Abergils , Sasson Barashy , Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa to the US . In December 2010 , the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the three associates of the Abergil brothers . 
 On January 12 , 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil , together with Sasson Barashy , Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa , were extradited to the US , arriving in Los Angeles on January 13 , aboard an American government airplane . They were being held in the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles , facing a 77 @-@ page , 32 @-@ count federal indictment that alleges murder , massive embezzlement , money laundering , racketeering and running a large Los Angeles @-@ based Ecstasy ring . The trial was set for November 8 , 2011 in the Los Angeles Federal District Court . If convicted , they may face life imprisonment , but not the death penalty , as US authorities have promised their Israeli counterparts that even if found guilty of murder , the five suspects would not be given the death penalty . Under the terms of the extradition agreement , they would likely serve their sentence in an Israeli prison . Shortly after the extradition , a threatening letter was found under the car of the wife of the Prosecutor who was involved in the extradition . 
 Despite evidence , Itzhak Abergil called the allegations “ police provocation ” during an earlier custody hearing , further stating that he had never been to the United States . In an interview on Israeli Television , Meir Abergil dismissed claims that he and his brother were important criminals , saying : “ Who are we ? We 're peanuts compared to the mafias they have in America [ ... ] Who are we ? Nothing , cockroaches . ” 
 = = After the extradition = = 
 According to Israeli police sources , the Abergil crime organization has continued to operate in Israel after Itzhak Abergil and his brother Meir were arrested . The Israeli Police reportedly believe that Moti Hassin , a reputed senior member of the Abergil group , took the reins of the organization after the Abergil brothers were extradited to the US . In March 2012 , Hassin and three alleged accomplices were arrested on suspicion of being responsible for two gangland hits carried out in the Tel Aviv area , the killings of Avi David , who was shot dead at point @-@ blank range by a motorcyclist outside a Bat Yam steakhouse in October 2011 , and <unk> Geffen , who died in a hail of gunfire at a gas station in <unk> two months later . In February 2013 , the police arrested three men suspected of taking part in the murder of Sharon Mizrachi , who was shot to death while sitting in his car in Bat Yam . According to the police , the main motive for the killings was the victim 's intention to join a rival crime gang , and were ordered by Hassin partly to establish his position as the new leader of the crime family . 
 In early May 2012 , five alleged members of the Abergil organization who were suspected of conspiring to commit a crime and possessing deadly weapons were arrested in Jerusalem , after police had found a weapons cache inside a storage room in an apartment building in Jerusalem where one of the suspects 's parents live . According to the suspects , they followed the advice of Itzhak Abergil to hide weapons in public buildings in order to deflect suspicion from the organization . At the suspects ’ homes police discovered signs of violence , including ceramic bulletproof vests with bullet holes in them . The police suspects that the organization was planning a major attack . According to the suspects , they were planning to take revenge on a Jerusalem resident , who owed the organization money . 
 = = Plea agreements = = 
 In August 2011 , Meir Abergil was freed and returned to Israel after having served about three years in prison first in Israel and then in the United States . Charged with blackmailing U.S. businessmen to whom the brothers had lent money , he allegedly had played a relatively minor role in the crimes and is thought to have been involved mainly in the extortion of Asi Vaknin , who was arrested in Mexico and brought to the United States in April 2011 , but refuses to testify against the Abergils . As a result , U.S. authorities reportedly were not able to build a case against Meir Abergil , leading to a plea agreement approved by a California court in which Abergil confessed to extortion of over a million dollars from another mob figure . In Israel , he faces criminal charges pending against him in the district court in Petah Tikva over allegations regarding his involvement in an Internet gambling business set up about 10 years ago which operated in many locations in Israel , including Internet cafes , convenience stores , soccer lottery outlets and nightclubs functioning as casinos . According to his lawyer , Abergil ′ s involvement in the alleged activities was marginal . 
 In May 2012 , Itzhak Abergil pleaded guilty in a Los Angeles federal court to being part of a racketeering enterprise that distributed Ecstasy and whose members killed Sami Atias for stealing a large drug shipment . On May 21 , 2012 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison , including the length of his detention in the US , leaving eight and a half years for him to serve . He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from prison . His lawyers called it " a good deal , " according to them , Abergil was facing the risk of getting a life sentence . He is to serve his time in Israel . 
 Moshe Malul pleaded guilty to a charge of racketeering conspiracy , admitting to conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to import the drug Ecstasy to the U.S. In his plea agreement , he acknowledged that as part of the Abergil crime family , he hired members of the Vineland Boyz street gang based in North Hollywood , to kill Sami Atias in retaliation for stealing Ecstasy that belonged to the Abergil organization . He was sentenced to 15 years in prison on June 21 , 2012 with credit for time served . He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from federal prison . 
 Israel Ozifa pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to import Ecstasy pills from Belgium into the United States . He was sentenced to eight years in federal prison on July 18 , 2012 with credit for time served . He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from federal prison . According to the prosecution , Ozifa was an " important , trusted and , most important , productive member " of the organization , while Ozifa 's attorney said his client was " really the running dog " of the Abergil family and only followed orders . 
 On January 8 , 2013 Sasson Barashy was found guilty of racketeering conspiracy and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with credit for time served . He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from federal prison .

 The second season of the American television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. , which is based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. ( Strategic Homeland Intervention , Enforcement , and Logistics Division ) , revolves around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and allies , who attempt to rebuild the organization following its collapse by the infiltration of the terrorist organization Hydra . It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe ( MCU ) , sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise . The season , which premiered on ABC on September 23 , 2014 , and ran until May 12 , 2015 , over 22 episodes , is produced by ABC Studios , Marvel Television , and Mutant Enemy Productions , with Jed Whedon , Maurissa Tancharoen , and Jeffrey Bell serving as showrunners . 
 A second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was ordered in May 2014 , and production began that July . Alongside Clark Gregg , who reprises his role as Coulson from the film series , principal cast members Ming @-@ Na Wen , Brett Dalton , Chloe Bennet , Iain De Caestecker , and Elizabeth Henstridge return from the first season , and are joined by Nick Blood and Adrianne Palicki . Several other characters from MCU films and Marvel One @-@ Shots also appear throughout the season . Some episodes directly crossover with the television series Agent Carter and the film Avengers : Age of Ultron , while the introduction of the Inhumans sets up the film of the same name and creates connections to the film Guardians of the Galaxy . 
 The season premiere was watched by 5 @.@ 98 million people , less than half the viewing total for the first season premiere , which was watched by 12 @.@ 12 million people . Overall , the season had a lower but much more consistent viewership than the previous season , as well as a much more positive critical response . The series was renewed for a third season on May 7 , 2015 .

 In March 2014 , executive producers Jeffrey Bell stated at the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. PaleyFest panel that the producers and the writers are able to read the screenplays for upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe films to know where the universe is heading , which allowed them to form a general plan for the show through the end of a third season . On May 8 , 2014 , the series was renewed for a second season of 22 episodes . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 In July 2014 , Clark Gregg stated that the season resumes " months later " from the end of season one , adding , " The monumental nature of [ rebuilding ] is made very clear almost immediately , because you realize everyone – US government , US military and other wise – wants to arrest us . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s illegal . We have very few resources . Everything we 're going to do involves dealing with , still , finding out who 's Hydra and who 's not amongst our friends . To rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D. , we 're going to need some old friends to prove themselves , some new friends , and we 're going to have to do it in a way that 's very back alley , old school . " 
 In September 2014 , talking about whether the ending of the season would also be a satisfying end to the series , Bell said " You never want it to end sooner rather than later . We know how this season is going to end , and if we need to calibrate it ... well , if it ends , that means people didn 't love the show , which is sad for many reasons . We 'd have a satisfying end to the season but we could make it a satisfying end to the series as much as any series finale is satisfying . Honestly , though , we 're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [ to season 2 ] and I think we pick up on it . I 'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer . " He also talked about whether the themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re @-@ explored in the second , saying " What we always look for are the human elements in the big story . That 's what television does well , it makes you care about people , and whether it 's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together , it takes on some sort of family metaphor . " Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season , saying " In many ways , the whole metaphor at the heart of the show is family — you 've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people , and it allows us to play out different dynamics ; literally , this season , we had Skye 's biological parents versus her surrogate parents . And at the same time , we had Skye growing up . We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full @-@ fledged superhero and so as we grow up , we separate from our parents ... In our minds , her mom wasn 't a villain so much ; she was an antagonist , but if you look at why she feels the way she does , Jiaying really earned that position . " 
 In December 2014 , Jed Whedon explained the benefits of introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans , saying " One of the things that , early on was very important to us last season was , there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers . Really , only two humans had powers , Captain America and the Hulk . We had to be very responsible – we didn 't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week , and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films . Along those same lines , the origin of a power is always a complex thing – Marvel cares about it feeling grounded , it feeling scientific at some level . Even on Thor , he says , " In our world , magic and science are the same thing . " So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world . It 's a way to introduce , into the MCU , the idea that people can be born with a power . They don 't have to be engineered in a lab , they don 't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid . They can be born with this . That 's sort of a <unk> , not just on our show , but in the cinematic universe " . 
 Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson , Maurissa Tancharoen explained that " Johnson is a character that we always liked . We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else . It took a little bit of time , but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson , and actually have that work in our mythology . But as with everything that we do on the show , we pull from the properties , and we do our own spin to it . So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines . We 've spent a season and a half with Skye . We 've seen her evolve as a person , we 've grown to like her as a person , we 've seen her evolve as an agent . And now , finally bringing her to her origin story – I think there 's just a lot more emotional weight to it , because you already know her as just Skye , and now she will have this ability that she may not understand , that she may not want ... We 're going to focus on Skye , and how that affects the people around her , and how the relationships may shift . Because we 've seen through the course of our series so far ; we 've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats <unk> or views them , and they 're categorized , things like that . What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability ? How do you categorize her ? " . Whedon elaborated that " One of the things that we 're focused on doing is treating it realistically in terms of , yes , this is an organization of people who have dealt with people like this for a long time , but this is personal . What does it mean when one of your own turns ? And not only that , because it 's an emotional situation for her , and she doesn 't totally understand what 's going on , and because it was tied to all this dark , Hydra stuff , and stuff with her father , and Raina – it might not sit well . We 're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means , and coming to terms with it . All that stuff is really interesting to us , and in television , because we have time to explore , we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths . We 're excited about it . But we aren 't going to turn into a show where there 's a new person with powers every week . " Additionally , Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal , saying , " She 's still Skye , because she thinks she 's Skye . I think her dad thinks she 's Daisy , and we 'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that 's something that she would want to call herself . But right now , she has her own identity . Now , that will change over time , but she 's definitely still Skye , and everybody still sees her that way . For now . " 
 On Coulson sacrificing his arm at the end of the season , Bell stated that " he had reasserted his value as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. , but he paid a price — that was important to us . You don 't mess with the forces of nature without getting bitten , and the fact that he literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful , heroic thing and showed you that at heart , Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words . He 'll do whatever it takes for the team , but that person occasionally has to pay a price " . Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by the Kree monolith : " When we first started talking about the Monolith , we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story ... It 's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever , and we did have a number of deaths this season , but I don 't think they were so much for shock value as the hopefully understandable logic of the characters and the stories . We prefer to leave you with something to talk about , to walk away with . This is something that came up in the room , we talked about what it meant … The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons — who had been one person — to become two whole people , come back together , agree to go on a date , and then have this happen , felt beautifully poetic " .

She is also portrayed by other cast members , including Ming @-@ Na Wen and Chloe Bennet , when she takes on the appearance of their characters . On October 1 , 2014 , Tim DeKay was cast as Senator Christian Ward , the older brother of principal character Grant Ward , who had previously appeared as a teenager through flashbacks in " The Well " . Jamie Harris , Simon Kassianides , Dichen Lachman , Luke Mitchell , Edward James Olmos , and Henry Simmons also recur as Gordon , Sunil Bakshi , Jiaying , Lincoln Campbell , Robert Gonzales , and Alphonso " Mack " MacKenzie respectively , throughout the season . 
 Additionally , Hayley Atwell , Kenneth Choi , Henry Goodman , and Neal McDonough reprise their roles from MCU films and Marvel One @-@ Shots as Peggy Carter , Jim Morita , Dr. List , and Timothy " Dum Dum " Dugan , respectively , during the season .

 During the season , the producers worked with Glenn Hetrick of Optic Nerve Studios to help create Raina 's Inhuman look , and introduce the Inhumans to the MCU . To get to the final look , the writers spent a lot of time discussing what her transformed look would entail , such as if she would have a nose , or a tail , with series writer Drew Greenberg eventually suggesting thorns . With the design idea in hand , Hetrick and his team began compiling potential designs for the character , looking to the Clive Barker film <unk> , specifically the character Shuna Sassi , because " She 's a creature covered in porcupine quills and that image is so strong — it creates such a striking silhouette " . Since Hetrick and his team did not have source material to pull from in the comics , he wanted to " make her feel like the first real Inhuman " and give her face a level of symmetry . When creating the prosthetic makeup , which was done in two weeks , the producers wanted to still be able to see Negga 's eyes , with Bell saying , " Ruth Negga has amazingly expressive eyes and eyebrows . And she gets so much of who Raina is through the eyes . We wanted her to still be able to communicate , we still wanted you to feel her expressions through all of [ the makeup ] . " 
 For the " real S.H.I.E.L.D. " faction introduced this season , the producers and Marvel decided to create a new S.H.I.E.L.D. logo , to differentiate from the normal one used on the series . This new logo uses the shape of Captain America 's original shield , as opposed to the updated round shape , and has 3 stars on it .

 Production on the season began in late July 2014 , in Culver City , California . Additional photography took place around the world , including in Old San Juan , Puerto Rico for " ... Ye Who Enter Here " and " What They Become " . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 To reflect the darker tone of the second season , the standard orchestra was changed from season one , with the low brass and strings expanded , and the woodwind section reduced , " giving [ the orchestra ] added punch and menace . " Composer Bear McCreary 's use of the electric guitar was also reduced for the second season , while his general synth programming was changed from " warm , round tones " to " mangled under heavy distortion " sound . 
 McCreary introduced a new Hydra theme for the season , explaining that " Last season got pretty musically complicated . I had a theme that associated itself with Centipede , The Clairvoyant , John Garrett and Raina . That theme ultimately functioned like a Hydra Theme . I had a theme for Victoria Hand that , while the audience briefly suspected her , also functioned as the Hydra Theme . I had a [ nother ] theme for Garrett that also acted like the theme for Hydra . It got so complicated ... The answer was obvious : I needed to write a new Hydra Theme , one that could be associated with Dr. Whitehall . " For Hayley Atwell 's appearances as Peggy Carter , McCreary decided to quote the Agent Carter theme composed by Christopher Lennertz for the Agent Carter short film . On using Lennertz 's theme , McCreary said , " I was excited for the opportunity to incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score , because it further cements the Marvel [ Cinematic ] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference . " A soundtrack featuring music from the first and second seasons was released by Marvel Music digitally on September 4 , 2015 , and on CD in October 2015 .

 Executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen stated the production team was not ruling out creating crossover episodes with Agent Carter or Guardians of the Galaxy during the season , with executive producer Jed Whedon adding that any such episodes would not equal the scale seen in the Captain America : The Winter Soldier crossover from the first season , saying , " In terms of game @-@ changers , [ those episodes are ] hard to beat . " Bell later said Avengers : Age of Ultron " is coming up and we know what 's going on with that and look forward to seeing it , but it 's pretty cool to find ways to tie @-@ in stuff and connect things . " In December 2014 , ABC confirmed the series would tie @-@ in with Avengers : Age of Ultron , with Whedon saying , " You should expect something . The Avengers is the big tent that all the franchises play under . Obviously , we 're included in that . " The episodes " The Frenemy of My Enemy " and " The Dirty Half Dozen " feature " Easter eggs , plot threads and other connective tissue leading into the opening scene of Avengers : Age of Ultron " while " Scars " explores the aftermath of the film . 
 Talking on how the season would interact with Agent Carter , Bell said , " Here 's what I think is interesting . Agent Carter seems to be about <unk> pre @-@ S.H.I.E.L.D. , but about the beginnings of something , and the basic values of that . S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics , and it gives us an opportunity to return to some of those core values and even physically , some of that <unk> stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool . Anyway we can tie things together , we 're going to try to do it , but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart . " Several scenes in " Shadows " and " The Things We Bury " are flashbacks featuring Peggy Carter which serve as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter , setting up characters and ideas for that series , including Carter 's belief in the need for " a permanent unit during peacetime " , which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D. The episode " Making Friends and Influencing People " names Hydra 's ability to brainwash people as the Faustus Method , named for the character who appears , as Johann <unk> , in Agent Carter , played by Ralph Brown . 
 The season confirms that the blue alien seen in the first season , and a recurring plot point this season , was a member of the Kree race , who play a significant role in Guardians of the Galaxy . Whedon explained that " We obviously showed this body a year ago at around this time . When we were breaking that and sussing out what this arc would be , we had to have a lot of the pieces in place from the get go ... we had to talk to features about what their plans were and where they were going . " When asked whether this counts as the series tie @-@ in to Guardians of the Galaxy , Whedon said " It is a very far away other galaxy , so it 's a little bit harder to have one of them walk into our set , so a direct tie @-@ in is a little bit more challenging , but it 's all one universe , so there 's always opportunity for more . ... In Guardians , we saw parts in our universe that we hadn 't explored yet , so it shows we 're a part of that too . " This storyline also introduces the Inhumans to the MCU , ahead of their own film . 
 At the end of the season , Bell stated on the way that the season had tied in with the films , " we got to be our own show and tell our own stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and do a nice hand off or a tie @-@ in , but neither are incumbent upon the other to be a follow , and I think that 's a great model for us . "

 In June 2014 , Clark Gregg stated he believed the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes , then breaking for Agent Carter , before airing the remaining 12 . Explaining this decision , Bell said , 
 One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over , what , 40 weeks ? 36 weeks ? Something like that . And the age of re @-@ runs is dead . Re @-@ runs are death , and so you 're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [ viewers ] tune in to something else or a re @-@ run and they 'll get pissed off . They 'll go away . What this allows us to do is minimize repeats . We 're showing ten episodes , and there has to be a gap or two because it 's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time , we can 't do that so there 's going to be a Marvel special at some point . But pretty much every week you 're showing up and we 're there , and then instead of a repeat showing up mid @-@ run and losing momentum , Agent Carter comes in and has its own cool stuff , and they 're running eight weeks in a row , then we can come back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions . We 're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time , barely , to finish 22 on schedule . It takes out the need for repeats in the back half . 
 The season began airing on September 23 , 2014 , on ABC in the United States , and on CTV in Canada , and concluded on May 12 , 2015 . In Australia , the season debuted on September 29 , 2014 , on Seven Network , while Channel 4 in the United Kingdom premiered the season on October 24 , 2014 .

 At the 2014 San Diego Comic @-@ Con , ahead of the premiere of the season , Marvel Custom Solutions and Lexus released a limited single @-@ issue comic tie @-@ in titled Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. : The Chase , set between the Season 1 episodes " Seeds " and " <unk> " , written by George Kitson , and with art by Mirko <unk> , Neil Edwards , and Mirco <unk> . On October 10 , 2014 , " Face My Enemy " was screened at New York Comic Con.

 For the final twelve episodes of the season , Marvel once again ran the " Art of ... " initiative , in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode , depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode , with the season 's title being " The Art of Evolution " . The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters , based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode . On how what is shown on each poster is chosen , Bell said , " maybe we 'll show [ the artist ] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what 's interesting to them . And then we have a conversation with them about how we 'd like to portray that , and then we try to lean into the strengths that they have . Some are more graphic , some are more character based , some are more composite , and some are cleaner . And that 's one of the things [ the producers ] really look forward to each week , getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation . " The art once again appeared as variant covers to select titles published by Marvel Comics in June 2015 . 
 The poster for " Aftershocks " , created by Gabriele Dell <unk> , the co @-@ creator of Daisy Johnson , depicts Skye twice , as she is transforming from the Terrigen mist and as the person dealing with her powers , as well as a transformed Raina , Coulson and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background . For " Who You Really Are " , the producers enlisted Marcos Martín to create the poster , which highlighted Sif 's ( Jaimie Alexander ) return to the show , as well as an " inside look " at S.H.I.E.L.D. as the logo crumbles , with Skye in the center of it , ambiguously leaving the viewer questioning if the logo was crumbling due to Sif 's sword , or Skye 's powers . The third poster , for " One of Us " , was created by Declan <unk> and Jordie Bellaire . It features muted colors and shows " Coulson surrounded by villains [ from the S.H.I.E.L.D. index ] , and the giant Cal looming over , and [ a bird and ] S.H.I.E.L.D. behind him . " Annie Wu was brought on for the " Love in the Time of Hydra " poster , which shows Grant Ward holding a woman , though depicts her as two ; one drawn in red , the other in blue – " half of that goes to Agent 33 , who has two faces ... And it also goes to the fact that she 's been imitating other people as she did with Agent May . " 
 " One Door Closes " , an episode focused on Bobbi Morse 's history , received a poster of her with the " real S.H.I.E.L.D. " logo , that " embraced the basics " of four @-@ color printing , utilizing magenta , cyan , black and yellow , while still having layers and complications , much like the character of Morse . The poster was designed by Delicious Design League . The poster for " Afterlife " by Dave Johnson , highlights the divide within S.H.I.E.L.D. and the alliances on each side . With Coulson in the middle , Agents Gonzales , Morse , Mackenzie and Weaver stem from the " real S.H.I.E.L.D. " , while Hunter , Fitz and Simmons stem from the other . " Melinda " ' s poster , by Jenny <unk> , mirrored the focus of the episode by prominently featuring an image of May , highlighting her backstory and why she is called " the Cavalry " . Marvel teamed with Nathan Fox on the poster for " The Frenemy of My Enemy " , which depicts Ward , Kara , and Bakshi in " Hydra red " ; Coulson , Hunter , and Fitz in " S.H.I.E.L.D. blue " ; and Deathlok neutral . They are all featured together , just as the season is " starting to put [ all of its plotlines ] together in new combinations in new ways , [ to ] propel us into the last four episodes . " 
 As alluded to by the episode title , the poster for " The Dirty Half Dozen " , with art by Jake Wyatt , sees the original recruits to Coulson 's S.H.I.E.L.D. team from the first season ( May , Ward , Fitz , Simmons and Skye ) , along with Coulson , together once again , suiting up for a mission together ; it is also the first poster of the " Art of ... " series to feature the episode title on the poster . Marguerite Sauvage provided the poster for " Scars " , which prominently features Jiaying and her scars in a way that the series cannot do with special effects , while also depicting Skye near the former 's stomach to cement the maternal connection between them . For Part One of the season finale , " S.O.S " , Ryan Sook ' s poster hints at Cal 's transformation into the Mr. Hyde persona from the comics , in an homage to traditional comic book covers . For Part Two , artist Joshua <unk> brought together all of the main players of the season , divided into Coulson and his team , and those who served as antagonists to them throughout the season ( though not necessarily villains ) , with Skye and some Terrigen crystals in the middle , pointing to Skye 's confused allegiances and the importance of the crystals in the finale .

 The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94 % approval rating with an average rating of 7 @.@ 2 / 10 based on 17 reviews . The website 's consensus reads , " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. relaxes into itself during its sophomore season , mitigating the show 's growing pains by focusing on characters while amping up narrative thrills . " 
 Marc <unk> for Den of Geek scored the premiere episode 4 @.@ 5 stars out of 5 , feeling that the series had finally reached its potential by incorporating Marvel elements such as Creel and Whitehall , while also creating a darker tone and developing the original characters . He specifically highlighted the changes made to Fitz ' character , saying " This lair of tragedy greatly deepens Fitz 's character and gives the comic relief of last season a heartbreaking edge . " James Hunt , also for Den of Geek , gave a positive review as well , stating " The momentum of last season 's finale hasn 't been lost , and indeed , it 's even been added to . Last year I criticised the pilot episode for , above all else , failing to recreate the feel of the Marvel Cinematic Universe . This year , it 's only fair that I praise the season opener for doing exactly that . " Kevin Fitzpatrick at Screen Crush called the premiere " unexpectedly good " , noting that the series " remains as serialized a show as it can over 22 episodes " , introducing new and interesting ideas for the rest of the season , while also setting a high standard for subsequent episodes to meet . 
 Alan Sepinwall at HitFix called the episode a promising start to the season , " a fairly lively hour in spite of [ a lot of exposition ] , helped by some good casting and smart creative choices " . He was positive about both the changes to the existing characters and the introduction of the new ones , and though he noted that the opening sequence was " itself a piece of brand extension — early promotion for Agent Carter , " he felt that " Links to the rest of the Marvel [ Cinematic U ] <unk> are always welcome when they 're in service to the story the show is telling " . Eric Goldman of IGN scored the episode an 8 @.@ 3 out of 10 , praising the visual style , which he called " less glossy " than previous episodes , as well as the introduction of new characters and development of old ones , especially the introduction of Carl Creel and the " nicely done FX showing off his power " . Oliver Sava of A.V. Club graded the episode a ' B- ' , feeling that " With a clearly defined villain and mission statement , this show 's second season is already off to a better start than its first year , but there 's still plenty of room for the series to grow . The scripts could use more energy , the action could be better choreographed , and it could use a huge injection of style for both the visual and audio elements . There 's so much potential in Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... but the show 's creators aren 't fully exploring it yet . " 
 At the end of the season , Goldman graded it an 8 @.@ 2 out of 10 , saying the season " found the show much @-@ improved , as it moved faster and delved deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe . " Compared to the first season , Goldman felt the " pacing was hugely improved , with storylines no longer taking forever to bubble up again and secrets no longer being kept both from the audience and the characters , " with content from the first season being resolved , while still introducing new plot lines and mysteries to play out over the season . He also praised the characterization improvement and called the season " less restrained " in connecting to its comics roots . While he appreciated the new characters that join the series , specifically MacLachlan 's portrayal of Cal , he felt Triplett was " never fully utilized " , which made his death in the midseason finale less impactful . Additionally , Goldman criticized the tie @-@ in to Age of Ultron , calling it " forced " and distracting from the Inhuman / S.H.I.E.L.D. 2 @.@ 0 storylines . Nick Hogan at TV Overmind rated the season 9 out of 10 stars , calling it , " for the most part , a very enjoyable season of television . " Hogan praised that cast and characters , particularly MacLachlan 's portrayal of Calvin <unk> , saying " He had perhaps the strongest character arc of anyone this season , and it was such a pleasure to watch . " He did criticize some of the story direction , feeling that it took a while for the Inhumans to connect to the rest of the series , and that the way the Age of Ultron tie @-@ in concluded the S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. storyline was " rushed and choppy " . 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 The season 's introduction of the Inhumans and apparent willingness to establish new norms ahead of the films has been highlighted by critics : 
 Sava felt that having the series introduce the race made Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " an essential part of Marvel Studios ' bigger plans for the future " , explaining that " the series has become more and more connected to the larger MCU since Captain America : The Winter Soldier , but it 's always been in a reactive role . Stuff happens in the movies , and Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. deals with the fallout . Not anymore . This show is making things happen , and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU because we know there 's an Inhumans movie planned for 2019 . " Sava also mentioned that introducing the Inhumans " on a personal level rather than a cosmic level " via the television series makes " the whole idea a bit easier to swallow " for the general MCU audience . 
 Merrill Barr of Forbes thought that by not only introducing the Inhumans ahead of the film , but by depicting the spreading of the race throughout the world , was part of the series cementing its " right to exist " apart from the films . Talking about the season finale , Barr said , " S.H.I.E.L.D. does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we 've never seen it do before . Come the final frame , all anyone – Marvel fan or otherwise – will be asking is when season three begins . The note the show leaves viewers on is one that will make them realize , perhaps for the first time , that the journey of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is not only worth it now , but perhaps always has been .

 Doctor Maya Lahan is a fictional character from the British espionage television series Spooks , which follows the exploits of Section D , a counter @-@ terrorism division in MI5 . She is portrayed by British actress Laila Rouass . Maya is introduced in the ninth series of the programme as the first love and former girlfriend of John Bateman ( who changed his name to Lucas North ) fifteen years before the events of the series . 
 Rouass ' involvement in the series was first announced in March 2010 , with her character name revealed later in May . Because Maya was only a background character , Rouass 's role was limited , did not perform any stunts and had time to perform other projects . The actress liked working with Richard Armitage , who played Lucas , as she knew him for some years prior to working on Spooks . The character was met with generally mixed reviews from critics .

 = = = Character arc = = = 
 Maya Lahan was born in York on 20 September 1975 . She became the girlfriend of John Bateman ( Richard Armitage ) whilst attending Leeds University . Maya was once aspired to open her own Tapas bar . When John became stuck in Dakar , he worked with Vaughn Edwards ( Iain Glen ) as a courier in order to get back home , but Maya remained unaware of his activities . Vaughn remembered that during their time , John would talk to him about Maya for hours at a time . However , after he was involved in the bombing of a British Embassy in 1995 , John was forced to leave Maya and murder friend Lucas North , and since started masquerading as him . In the belief that John died , Maya got on with her life , becoming a doctor and enters a relationship with Vaughn ( whom she knows as Michael ) . 
 Fifteen years later , in the first episode of the ninth series , Vaughn visits Lucas and leaves him with several mementos of his former life , including pictures of him and Maya . Lucas finds the hospital where she works to meet her . However , Maya <unk> rejects him , stating she moved on with somebody else , and that she no longer needs him . By the end of the third episode however , Lucas invites her to his home and the two have sex on a kitchen table , thus restarting their relationship . However , over the course of the series , Vaughn has been manipulating Lucas , by giving him Maya back into his life , in order to get his hands on an MI5 file named " Albany " , which contain blueprints for a genetic weapon . To further force Lucas ' hand in getting the file , Vaughn abducts Maya , though he was possibly doing this in order to protect her from Chinese agents who wish to acquire Albany , and threatening to rape then behead Maya should Vaughn fail to deliver . Later , Lucas finds Maya after mortally wounding Vaughn . Having confessed his past crimes to his MI5 superior , Harry Pearce ( Peter Firth ) , Lucas intends to flee the country with Maya , and agrees to give the Chinese Albany in exchange for money , and new identities for the couple . However , Maya is approached by hired specialist , Alec White ( Vincent Regan ) , who tells her of Lucas 's past crimes . By doing so , Maya turns against Lucas , and attempts to get him to surrender . However , when Beth Bailey ( Sophia Myles ) and Dimitri Levendis ( Max Brown ) arrive , Lucas takes Maya to his car and evades them . When Beth and <unk> open fire , a bullet hits Maya in the torso , and she dies . Because a GPS tracker was placed on Maya , Lucas leaves her body behind .

 Maya is depicted as the first love of Lucas North . Laila Rouass stated " she 's the love of his life and he 's the love of hers . " When he is forced to disappear , it " completely rocks her world . " Armitage meanwhile believed that Maya had an effect with every relationship Lucas had since , and having failed them all , Lucas hangs onto thinking about Maya . When Lucas returns , Maya 's life is turns " upside down , " and she is angry at him because she feels betrayed by him . Armitage stated that Lucas was " just compelled to see her " after looking at photographs of them both together , and really shapes his future . Both characters go on " quite an interesting journey " because Maya moved on with her life without Lucas , and he has to fight to get her to listen to him . However , when they start to restart their relationship , Vaughn gets in the way and " throws water over it . " Rouass believes that Lucas " definitely " trusts Maya without question , and that their relationship is " dynamic and explosive " and makes them " question certain things . " Neither of them can control their relationship , which scares Maya . Iain Glen believed that Maya is also Lucas ' central weakness , and his love for her becomes instrumental to his downfall .

 In March 2010 , it was announced that Laila Rouass has joined the cast of the ninth series of Spooks , along with Max Brown and Sophia Myles , however at the time Sarah <unk> from the BBC refused to reveal details of the character , including the name , citing " we don 't want to give too much away as intrigue and betrayal are at the heart of the storylines . " Later in May of the same year , co @-@ star Richard Armitage announced Rouass would play a character named Maya , described as " an old flame of Lucas 's , possibly his first love . " 
 Rouass was acquainted with the series , having viewed the first two series and " dipped in and out of it . " She also stated that Maya is only a background character throughout the series , meaning her role is limited , and does not play a spy or becoming " part of this mafia or that mafia . " Due to her limited appearance , the actress was available to perform other projects , including The Sarah Jane Adventures and Conan the Barbarian , as well as spending the free time with her daughter . Rouass does not participate in any stunt work , but does appear in " a lot of passionate scenes . " Having gotten used to filming sex scenes in Footballers ' Wives , Rouass noticed that while humour was involved in Footballers ' Wives , Spooks was more passionate and very choreographed . In an interview with the Daily Mirror , Rouass recalled one of the scenes ; " there 's one scene where we get together in the kitchen and the director was like , ' Come on , let 's be honest , you haven 't seen each other for years , you 're not going to get all romantic , you 're going to shag her on the table . ' " 
 Rouass liked working with Armitage during her duration on the series , having met him in Los Angeles a few years prior , as well as Iain Glen , who plays Vaughn Edwards , although she was worried that should " Maya let anything happen to [ Lucas ] I 'll be one of the most hated women in the country . " She also admitted she had " no idea " if her character would be killed off , but said in an interview with Digital Spy , " at the end of the day , you just know what the show 's about . You know there 's a chance that you could go , but you have to embrace that . "

 The character was met by generally mixed reactions from critics . Nick Bryan of Dork Adore was not convinced of the Lucas and Maya storyline , stating " I keep forgetting she exists whenever she 's off @-@ screen . Vicky Frost of The Guardian had mixed reactions towards the character , writing " let 's hope that Maya turns out to be more than just a device for us to find out about Lucas ' past , " but adds that she is not " holding my breath . " For the finale , Frost criticised the writing behind the line where Maya admits she always believed Lucas ' actions when she was told " seemed almost giddily optimistic . "

Her mother , Renée , is remarried to a minor league baseball player , and they travel often to attend games . Bella makes several friends at her new high school , but she is intrigued by the mysterious and aloof Cullen siblings . Bella sits next to Edward Cullen in biology class on her first day of school , but he seems to be repulsed by her . After a week of absence from school , Edward comes back and talks to Bella normally . A few days later , Bella is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot . Edward saves her by instantaneously covering a distance of over 30 feet and putting himself between Bella and the van , stopping it with only his hand and making a conspicuous dent . He subsequently refuses to explain his actions to Bella and warns her against befriending him . 
 After much research , Bella concludes that Edward is a vampire . He eventually confirms this but says he and the other Cullens only consume animal blood . The pair fall in love , and Edward introduces Bella to his vampire family . Carlisle Cullen , the family patriarch , is a doctor working in Forks . His wife is Esme , and Alice , Jasper , Emmett , and Rosalie are their informally adopted children . Edward and Bella 's relationship is soon put in jeopardy , when three nomadic vampires — James , Victoria , and Laurent — arrive in Forks . James , a tracker vampire with incredible hunting instincts , is instantly intrigued by Edward 's protectiveness over a human , which incites him to hunt Bella for sport . Edward and the other Cullens risk their lives to protect Bella , but James tracks her to Phoenix , where she is hiding with Jasper and Alice . James lures Bella into a trap by falsely claiming that he is holding her mother hostage . James breaks Bella 's leg before biting her wrist , infecting her with vampire venom . After a ferocious fight , Edward subdues James just as the other Cullens arrive . Alice , Emmett , and Jasper destroy James , decapitating and burning him , as Edward sucks the venom from Bella 's wrist , preventing her from turning into a vampire . Upon returning to Forks , Edward accompanies Bella to the high school prom , where he refuses to grant her request that he transform her into a vampire .

 Stephenie Meyer 's paranormal romance novel Twilight was originally optioned by Paramount Pictures ' MTV Films in April 2004 , but the screenplay that was subsequently developed was substantially different from its source material . When Summit Entertainment reinvented itself as a full @-@ service studio in April 2007 , it began development of a film adaptation anew , having picked up the rights from Paramount ( who coincidentally had made an unrelated film with the same title in 1998 ) in a turnaround . The company perceived the film as an opportunity to launch a franchise based on the success of Meyer 's book and its sequels . Catherine Hardwicke was hired to direct the film and Melissa Rosenberg was hired to write the script in mid @-@ 2007 . 
 Rosenberg developed an outline by the end of August , and collaborated with Hardwicke on writing the screenplay during the following month . Rosenberg said Hardwicke " was a great sounding board and had all sorts of brilliant ideas .... I 'd finish off scenes and send them to her , and get back her notes . " Due to the impending Writers Guild of America strike , Rosenberg worked full @-@ time to finish the screenplay before October 31 . In adapting the novel , she " had to condense a great deal . " Some characters from the novel were not featured in the screenplay , whereas some characters were combined into others . " [ O ] ur intent all along was to stay true to the book " , Rosenberg explained , " and it has to do less with adapting it word for word and more with making sure the characters ' arcs and emotional journeys are the same . " Hardwicke suggested the use of voice over to convey Bella 's internal dialogue — since the novel is told from her point of view — and she sketched some of the storyboards during pre @-@ production . 
 = = = Adaptation from source material = = = 
 The filmmakers behind Twilight worked to create a film that was as faithful to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium , with producer Greg <unk> saying , " It 's very important to distinguish that we 're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very , very faithful to the book .... But at the same time , we have a separate responsibility to make the best movie you can make . " To ensure a faithful adaptation , Meyer was kept very involved in the production process , having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film . Of this process , she said , " It was a really pleasant exchange [ between me and the filmmakers ] from the beginning , which I think is not very typical . They were really interested in my ideas " , and , " ... they kept me in the loop and with the script , they let me see it and said , ' What are your thoughts ? ' ... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script . " Meyer fought for one line in particular , one of the most well @-@ known from the book about " the lion and the lamb " , to be kept verbatim in the film : " I actually think the way Melissa [ Rosenberg ] wrote it sounded better for the movie [ ... ] but the problem is that line is actually tattooed on peoples ' bodies [ ... ] But I said , ' You know , if you take that one and change it , that 's a potential backlash situation . ' " Meyer was even invited to create a written list of things that could not be changed for the film , such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book , that the studio agreed to follow . The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material , with one reviewer stating that , with a few exceptions , " Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it . " 
 However , as is most often the case with film adaptations , differences do exist between the film and source material . Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film , such as a biology room scene where Bella 's class does blood typing . Hardwicke explains , " Well [ the book is ] almost 500 pages — you do have to do the sweetened condensed milk version of that .... We already have two scenes in biology : the first time they 're in there and then the second time when they connect . For a film , when you condense , you don 't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over . So that 's not in there . " The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more " visually dynamic " on @-@ screen , such as Bella 's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire — this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward 's car as in the novel . A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella 's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van . The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel . Rosenberg said that " you don 't really see James and the other villains until to the last quarter of the book , which really won 't work for a movie . You need that ominous tension right off the bat . We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start . And so I had to create back story for them , what they were up to , to flesh them out a bit as characters . " Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students , with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film , and a " compilation of a couple of different human characters " becoming Eric Yorkie . About these variances from the book , <unk> stated , " I think we did a really judicious job of distilling [ the book ] . Our greatest critic , Stephenie Meyer , loves the screenplay , and that tells me that we made all the right choices in terms of what to keep and what to lose . Invariably , you 're going to lose bits and pieces that certain members of the audience are going to desperately want to see , but there 's just a reality that we 're not making ' Twilight : The Book ' the movie . "

 Kristen Stewart was on the set of Adventureland when Hardwicke visited her for an informal screen test that " captivated " the director . Hardwicke had trouble finding an actor otherworldly enough to play vampire Edward Cullen . Then she got a call about a guy in London . " I looked at a couple pictures and was like , ‘ I ’ m not sure , ’ ? " Hardwicke says . " He had been fired from his last job , he was unemployed , he was in debt . " Pattinson flew to Los Angeles on his own dime to read with Stewart . Shiloh Fernandez , Jackson Rathbone , Ben Barnes , and Robert Pattinson were the final four up for the role of Edward . Hardwicke did not initially choose Robert Pattinson for the role of Edward Cullen , but after an audition at her home with Stewart , he was selected . Hardwicke said , " Kristen was like , ‘ It ’ s got to be Rob ! ’ She felt connected to him from the first moment . That electricity , or love at first sight , or whatever it is . " Hardwicke gave him the part , but he had to make a promise . " You ’ ve got to realize that Kristen is 17 years old , " Hardwicke told him , " She ’ s underage . You ’ ve got to focus , dude , or you ’ re going to be arrested . I made him swear on a stack of Bibles . " Pattinson was unfamiliar with the novel series prior to his screen test but read the books later on . Meyer allowed him to view a manuscript of the unfinished Midnight Sun , which chronicles the events in Twilight from Edward 's point of view . Fan reaction to Pattinson 's casting as Edward was initially negative ; Rachelle Lefèvre remarked that " [ e ] very woman had their own Edward [ that ] they had to let go of before they could open up to [ him ] , which they did . " Meyer was " excited " and " ecstatic " in response to the casting of the two main characters . She had expressed interest in having Emily Browning and Henry Cavill cast as Bella and Edward , respectively , prior to pre @-@ production . 
 Peter Facinelli was not originally cast as Carlisle Cullen . " [ Hardwicke ] liked me , but there was another actor that the studio was pushing for " , Facinelli said . For unknown reasons , that actor was not able to play the part and Facinelli was selected in his place . The choice of Ashley Greene to portray Alice Cullen was the subject of fan criticism due to Greene being 7 inches ( 18 cm ) taller than her character as described in the novel . Meyer had also stated that Rachael Leigh Cook resembled her vision of Alice . Nikki Reed had previously worked with Hardwicke on Thirteen , which they wrote together , and Lords of Dogtown . Reed commented , " I don 't want to say it 's a coincidence , because we do work well together , and we have a great history . I think we make good work , but it 's more that the people that hire [ Hardwicke ] to direct a film of theirs [ have ] most likely seen her other work . " 
 Kellan Lutz was in Africa shooting the HBO miniseries Generation Kill when the auditions for the character of Emmett Cullen were conducted . The role had already been cast by the time that production ended in December 2007 , but the actor who had been selected " fell through " ; Lutz subsequently auditioned and was flown to Oregon , where Hardwicke personally chose him . Rachelle Lefèvre was interested in pursuing a role in the film because Hardwicke was attached to the project as director ; there was also " the potential to explore a character , hopefully , over three films " ; and she wanted to portray a vampire . She " thought that vampires were basically the best metaphor for human anxiety and questions about being alive . " Christian Serratos initially auditioned for Jessica Stanley , but she " fell totally in love with Angela " after reading the novels and successfully took advantage of a later opportunity to audition for Angela Weber . The role of Jessica Stanley went to Anna Kendrick , who got the part after two mix @-@ and @-@ match auditions with various actors .

 On a bed in Catherine Hardwicke 's house is where Pattinson kissed Stewart for the first time for the Twilight screen test . " That bed made Pattinson who he is right now , " says Reed . That ’ s also where Hardwicke auditioned Evan Rachel Wood , when she had her get into her bed with Nikki Reed for the film Thirteen . When asked about her lair , Hardwicke says , " MTV came and did an episode in my house filming the bed . It ’ s legendary . " Principal photography took 44 days , after more than a week of rehearsals , and completed on May 2 , 2008 . Similar to her directorial debut Thirteen , Hardwicke opted for an extensive use of hand @-@ held cinematography to make the film " feel real " . Meyer visited the production set three times and was consulted on different aspects of the story ; she also has a brief cameo in the film . Cast members who portrayed vampires avoided sunlight to make their skin pale , though makeup was also applied for that effect , and wore contact lenses : " We did the golden color because the Cullens have those golden eyes . And then , when we 're hungry , we have to pop the black ones in , " Facinelli explained . They also participated in rehearsals with a dance choreographer and observed the physicality of different panthera to make their bodily movements more elegant . 
 Scenes were filmed primarily in Portland , Oregon . Stunt work was done mainly by the cast . The fight sequence between Gigandet and Pattinson 's characters in a ballet studio , which was filmed during the first week of production , involved a substantial amount of wire work because the vampires in the story have superhuman strength and speed . Gigandet incorporated mixed martial arts fighting moves in this sequence , which involved chicken and honey as substitutes for flesh . Bella , the protagonist , is unconscious during these events , and since the novel is told from her point of view , such action sequences are illustrative and unique to the film . Pattinson noted that maintaining one 's center of gravity is difficult when doing wire work " because you have to really fight against it as well as letting it do what it needs to do . " Lefèvre found the experience disorienting since forward motion was out of her control . 
 Instead of shooting at Forks High School itself , scenes taking place at the school were filmed at Kalama High School and Madison High School . Other scenes were filmed in St. Helens , and Hardwicke conducted some reshooting in Pasadena , California , in August . Twilight was originally scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on December 12 , 2008 , but its release date was changed to November 21 after Harry Potter and the Half @-@ Blood Prince was rescheduled for an opening in July 2009 . Two teaser trailers , as well as some additional scenes , were released for the film , as well as a final trailer , which was released on October 9 . A 15 @-@ minute excerpt of Twilight was presented during the International Rome Film Festival in Italy . The film received a rating of PG @-@ 13 from the Motion Picture Association of America for " some violence and a scene of sensuality " .

 = Dylan Thomas = 
 Dylan <unk> Thomas ( 27 October 1914 – 9 November 1953 ) was a Welsh poet and writer whose works include the poems " Do not go gentle into that good night " and " And death shall have no dominion " ; the ' play for voices ' Under Milk Wood ; and stories and radio broadcasts such as A Child 's Christmas in Wales and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog . He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City . By then , he had acquired a reputation , which he encouraged , as a " <unk> , drunken and doomed poet " . 
 Thomas was born in Swansea , Wales , in 1914 . An undistinguished pupil , he left school at 16 and became a journalist for a short time . Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager ; however , it was the publication of " Light breaks where no sun shines , " in 1934 , that caught the attention of the literary world . While living in London , Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara , whom he married in 1937 . Their relationship was defined by alcoholism and was mutually destructive . In the early part of their marriage , Thomas and his family lived hand @-@ to @-@ mouth , settling in the Welsh fishing village of Laugharne . 
 Thomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime , and he found earning a living as a writer difficult . He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts . His radio recordings for the BBC during the late 1940s brought him to the public 's attention , and he was frequently used by the BBC as a populist voice of the literary scene . 
 Thomas first traveled to the United States in the 1950s . This is where his readings brought him a level of fame while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened . His time in America cemented Thomas 's legend , however , and he went on to record to vinyl such works as A Child 's Christmas in Wales . During his fourth trip to New York in 1953 , Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma , from which he never recovered . He died on 9 November 1953 . His body was returned to Wales where he was interred at the village churchyard in Laugharne on 25 November 1953 . 
 Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language . He has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century . He is noted for his original , rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery . Thomas 's position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed , and he remains popular with the public .

 Dylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in Swansea , the son of Florence Hannah ( née Williams ; 1882 – 1958 ) , a seamstress , and David John Thomas ( 1876 – 1952 ) , a teacher . His father had a first @-@ class honours degree in English from University College , Aberystwyth , and ambitions to rise above his position teaching English literature at the local grammar school . Thomas had one sibling , Nancy ( Nancy Marles 1906 – 1953 ) , who was nine years older . The children spoke only English though their parents were bilingual in English and Welsh , and David Thomas gave Welsh lessons at home . Thomas 's father chose the name Dylan , which could be translated as " son of the sea " , after Dylan ail Don , a character in The Mabinogion . His middle name , <unk> , was given in honour of his great @-@ uncle , William Thomas , a Unitarian minister and poet whose bardic name was Gwilym Marles . Dylan , pronounced ˈ ( Dull @-@ an ) in Welsh , caused his mother to worry he might be teased as the " dull one " . When he broadcast on Welsh BBC , early in his career , he was introduced using this pronunciation . Thomas favoured the Anglicised pronunciation and gave instructions that it should be <unk> / <unk> / . 
 The red @-@ brick semi @-@ detached house at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive , in which Thomas was born and lived until he was 19 , had been bought by his parents in the respectable area of the Uplands a few months before his birth . His childhood was spent in Swansea , with summer trips to Carmarthenshire to visit Fernhill , a dairy farm owned by his maternal aunt , Ann Jones , the memory of which is used for the 1945 lyrical poem " Fern Hill " . Thomas had bronchitis and asthma in childhood and struggled with these throughout his life . Thomas was indulged by his mother and enjoyed being <unk> , a trait he carried into adulthood and he was skilful at gaining attention and sympathy . Thomas 's formal education began at Mrs Hole 's dame school a private school on Mirador Crescent , a few streets away from his home . He described his experience there in Quite Early One Morning : 
 Never was there such a dame school as ours , so firm and kind and smelling of galoshes , with the sweet and fumbled music of the piano lessons drifting down from upstairs to the lonely schoolroom , where only the sometimes tearful wicked sat over undone sums , or to repent a little crime — the pulling of a girl 's hair during geography , the sly shin kick under the table during English literature . 
 In October 1925 , Thomas enrolled at Swansea Grammar School for boys , in Mount Pleasant , where his father taught English . He was an undistinguished pupil who shied away from school , preferring reading . In his first year one of his poems was published in the school 's magazine and before he left he became its editor . During his final school years he began writing poetry in notebooks , the first poem dated 27 April ( 1930 ) , is entitled " Osiris , come to Isis " . In June 1928 Thomas won the school 's mile race , held at St. Helen 's Ground ; he carried a newspaper photograph of his victory with him until his death . In 1931 , when he was 16 , Thomas left school to become a reporter for the South Wales Daily Post , only to leave under pressure 18 months later . Thomas continued to work as a freelance journalist for several years during which time he remained at Cwmdonkin Drive where he continued to add to his notebooks , amassing 200 poems in four books between 1930 and 1934 . Of the 90 poems he published , half were written during these years . 
 In his free time , he joined the amateur dramatic group at the Little Theatre in Mumbles , visited the cinema in Uplands , took walks along Swansea Bay , and frequented Swansea 's pubs , especially the Antelope and the Mermaid Hotels in Mumbles . In the Kardomah Café , close to the newspaper office in Castle Street , he met his creative contemporaries , including his friend the poet Vernon Watkins . The group of writers , musicians and artists became known as " The Kardomah Gang " . In 1933 , Thomas visited London for probably the first time .

 Thomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published : " And death shall have no dominion " , " Before I Knocked " and " The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower " . " And death shall have no dominion " appeared in the New English Weekly in May 1933 . When " Light breaks where no sun shines " appeared in The Listener in 1934 , it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London , T. S. Eliot , Geoffrey Grigson and Stephen Spender . They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume , 18 Poems , was published in December 1934 . 18 Poems was noted for its visionary qualities which led to critic Desmond Hawkins writing that the work was " the sort of bomb that bursts no more than once in three years " . The volume was critically acclaimed and won a contest run by the Sunday Referee , netting him new admirers from the London poetry world , including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir . The anthology was published by Fortune Press , in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves . A similar arrangement was used by other new authors including Philip Larkin . In December 1935 Thomas contributed the poem " The Hand That Signed the Paper " to Issue 18 of the bi @-@ monthly New Verse . In 1936 , his next collection Twenty @-@ five Poems , published by J. M. Dent , also received much critical praise . In all , he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London . It was the time that Thomas 's reputation for heavy drinking developed . 
 In early 1936 , Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara ( 1913 – 1994 ) , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old blonde @-@ haired , blue @-@ eyed dancer of Irish descent . She had run away from home , intent on making a career in dance , and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium . Introduced by Augustus John , Caitlin 's lover , they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London 's West End . Laying his head in her lap , a drunken Thomas proposed . Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed together ten minutes after they first met . Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John , she and Thomas began a correspondence , and in the second half of 1936 were courting . They married at the register office in Penzance , Cornwall , on 11 July 1937 . In early 1938 they moved to Wales , renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne , Carmarthenshire . Their first child , Llewelyn Edouard , was born on 30 January 1939 . 
 By the late 1930s , Thomas was embraced as the " poetic herald " for a group of English poets , the New <unk> . Thomas refused to align himself with them and declined to sign their manifesto . He later stated that he believed they were " intellectual <unk> leaning on a theory " . Despite this , many of the group , including Henry Treece , modelled their work on Thomas . 
 = = = Wartime , 1939 – 1945 = = = 
 In 1939 The Map of Love appeared as a collection of 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934 . Ten stories in his next book , Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog ( 1940 ) , were based less on lavish fantasy than The Map of Love and more on real @-@ life romances featuring himself in Wales . Sales of both books were poor , resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing . At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances . Hounded by creditors , Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield , Gloucestershire . There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King 's Canary , though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976 . 
 At the outset of the Second World War , Thomas was worried about conscription and referred to his ailment as " an unreliable lung " . Coughing sometimes confined him to bed and he had a history of bringing up blood and mucus . After initially seeking employment in a reserved occupation , he managed to be classified Grade III , which meant that he would be among the last to be called up for service . Saddened to see his friends going on active service , he continued drinking and struggled to support his family . He wrote begging letters to random literary figures asking for support , a plan he hoped would provide a long @-@ term regular income . Thomas supplemented his income by writing scripts for the BBC , which not only gave him additional earnings but also provided evidence that he was producing essential war work . 
 In February 1941 , Swansea was bombed by the Luftwaffe in a " three nights ' blitz " . Castle Street was one of many streets that suffered badly ; rows of shops , including the Kardomah Café , were destroyed . Thomas walked through the bombed @-@ out shell of the town centre with his friend Bert Trick . Upset at the sight , he concluded : " Our Swansea is dead " . Soon after the bombing raids , Thomas wrote a radio play , Return Journey Home , which described the café as being " razed to the snow " . The play was first broadcast on 15 June 1947 . The Kardomah Café reopened on Portland Street after the war . 
 In May 1941 , Thomas and Caitlin moved to London , leaving their son with his grandmother at <unk> in Hampshire . Thomas hoped to find employment in the film industry and wrote to the director of the films division of the Ministry of Information ( MOI ) . After being rebuffed he found work with Strand Films providing him with his first regular income since the Daily Post . Strand produced films for the MOI ; Thomas scripted at least five films in 1942 , This Is Colour ( a history of the British dyeing industry ) and New Towns For Old ( on post @-@ war reconstruction ) . These Are The Men ( 1943 ) was a more ambitious piece in which Thomas 's verse accompanies Leni Riefenstahl 's footage of an early Nuremberg Rally . Conquest of a Germ ( 1944 ) explored the use of early antibiotics in the fight against pneumonia and tuberculosis . Our Country ( 1945 ) was a romantic tour of Britain set to Thomas 's poetry . 
 In early 1943 Thomas began a relationship with Pamela Glendower , one of several affairs he had during his marriage . The affairs either ran out of steam or were halted after Caitlin discovered his infidelity . In March 1943 Caitlin gave birth to a daughter , Aeronwy , in London . They lived in a run @-@ down studio in Chelsea , made up of a single large room with a curtain to separate the kitchen . 
 In 1944 , with the threat of German flying bombs on London , Thomas moved to the family cottage in Blaen Cwm near <unk> , where Thomas resumed writing poetry , completing " Holy Spring " and " Vision and Prayer " . In September Thomas and Caitlin moved to New Quay in West Wales which inspired Thomas to pen the radio piece Quite Early One Morning , a sketch for his later work , Under Milk Wood . Of the poetry written at this time , of note is " Fern Hill " , believed to have been started while living in New Quay , but completed at Blaen Cwm in mid @-@ 1945 .

 Although Thomas had previously written for the BBC , it was a minor source of income and the occurrences intermittent . In 1943 he wrote and recorded a 15 @-@ minute talk entitled " Reminiscences of Childhood " for the Welsh BBC . In December 1944 he recorded Quite Early One Morning ( produced by Aneirin Talfan Davies , again for the Welsh BBC ) but when Davies offered it for national broadcast BBC London turned it down . On 31 August 1945 the BBC Home Service broadcast Quite Early One Morning , and in the three years beginning October 1945 , Thomas made over a hundred broadcasts for the corporation . Thomas was employed not only for his poetry readings , but for discussions and critiques . 
 By late September 1945 the Thomases had left Wales and were living with various friends in London . The publication of Deaths and Entrances in 1946 was a turning point for Thomas . Poet and critic Walter J. Turner commented in The Spectator , " This book alone , in my opinion , ranks him as a major poet " . 
 In the second half of 1945 , Thomas began reading for the BBC Radio programme , Book of Verse , broadcast weekly to the Far East providing Thomas with a regular income and bringing him into contact with Louis MacNeice , a congenial drinking companion whose advice Thomas cherished . On 29 September 1946 , the BBC began transmitting the Third Programme , a high @-@ culture network which provided opportunities for Thomas . He appeared in the play Comus for Third Programme , the day after the network launched , and his rich , sonorous voice led to character parts , including the lead in Aeschylus ' Agamemnon and Satan in an adaptation of Paradise Lost . Thomas remained a popular guest on radio talk shows for the BBC who regarded him as " useful should a younger generation poet be needed " . He had an uneasy relationship with BBC management and a staff job was never an option , with drinking cited as the problem . Despite this , Thomas became a familiar radio voice and within Britain was " in every sense a celebrity " . 
 Thomas visited the home of historian A. J. P. Taylor in Disley . Although Taylor disliked him intensely , he stayed for a month , drinking " on a monumental scale " , up to 15 or 20 pints of beer a day . In late 1946 Thomas turned up at the Taylors ' again , this time homeless and with Caitlin . Margaret Taylor let them take up residence in the garden summerhouse . In May 1949 Thomas and his family moved to his final home , the Boat House at Laugharne purchased for him at a cost of £ 2 @,@ 500 in April 1949 by Margaret Taylor . Thomas acquired a garage a hundred yards from the house on a cliff ledge which he turned into his writing shed , and where he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems . Just before moving into there , Thomas rented " Pelican House " opposite his regular drinking den , Brown 's Hotel , for his parents who lived there from 1949 until 1953 . It was there that his father died and the funeral was held . Caitlin gave birth to their third child , a boy named Colm Garan Hart , on 25 July 1949 . 
 = = = American tours , 1950 – 1953 = = = 
 John Brinnin invited Thomas to New York , where in 1950 they embarked on a lucrative three @-@ month tour of arts centres and campuses . The tour , which began in front of an audience of a thousand at the Kaufmann Auditorium of the Poetry Centre in New York , took in about 40 venues . During the tour Thomas was invited to many parties and functions and on several occasions became drunk - going out of his way to shock people - and was a difficult guest . Thomas drank before some of his readings , though it is argued he may have pretended to be more affected by it than he actually was . The writer Elizabeth Hardwick recalled how intoxicating a performer he was and how the tension would build before a performance : " Would he arrive only to break down on the stage ? Would some dismaying scene take place at the faculty party ? Would he be offensive , violent , obscene ? " Caitlin said in her memoir , " Nobody ever needed encouragement less , and he was drowned in it . " 
 On returning to Britain Thomas began work on two further poems , " In the white giant 's thigh " , which he read on the Third Programme in September 1950 , and the incomplete " In country heaven " . 1950 is also believed to be the year that he began work on ' Under Milk Wood ' , under the working title ' The Town That Was Mad ' . The task of seeing this work through to production was assigned to the BBC 's Douglas Cleverdon , who had been responsible for casting Thomas in ' Paradise Lost ' . Despite Cleverdon 's urges , the script slipped from Thomas 's priorities and in early 1951 he took a trip to Iran to work on a film for the Anglo @-@ Iranian Oil Company . The film was never made , with Thomas returning to Wales in February , though his time there allowed him to provide a few minutes of material for a BBC documentary entitled ' Persian Oil ' . Early that year Thomas wrote two poems , which Thomas 's principal biographer , Paul Ferris describes as " unusually blunt " ; the ribald " Lament " and an ode , in the form of a villanelle , to his dying father " Do not go gentle into that good night " . 
 Despite a range of wealthy patrons , including Margaret Taylor , Princess Marguerite Caetani and <unk> Howard @-@ Stepney , Thomas was still in financial difficulty , and he wrote several begging letters to notable literary figures including the likes of T. S. Eliot . Taylor was not keen on Thomas taking another trip to the United States , and thought that if Thomas had a permanent address in London he would be able to gain steady work there . She bought a property , 54 Delancey Street , in Camden Town , and in late 1951 Thomas and Caitlin lived in the basement flat . Thomas would describe the flat as his " London house of horror " and did not return there after his 1952 tour of America . 
 Thomas undertook a second tour of the United States in 1952 , this time with Caitlin - after she had discovered he had been unfaithful on his earlier trip . They drank heavily , and Thomas began to suffer with gout and lung problems . The second tour was the most intensive of the four , taking in 46 engagements . The trip also resulted in Thomas recording his first poetry to vinyl , which Caedmon Records released in America later that year . One of his works recorded during this time , A Child 's Christmas in Wales , became his most popular prose work in America . The original 1952 recording of A Child 's Christmas in Wales was a 2008 selection for the United States National Recording Registry , stating that it is " credited with launching the audiobook industry in the United States " . 
 In April 1953 Thomas returned alone for a third tour of America . He performed a " work in progress " version of Under Milk Wood , solo , for the first time at Harvard University on 3 May . A week later the work was performed with a full cast at the Poetry Centre in New York . He met the deadline only after being locked in a room by Brinnin 's assistant , Liz Reitell , and was still editing the script on the afternoon of the performance ; its last lines were handed to the actors as they put on their makeup . In the wake of the play 's US success , the composer Stravinsky invited Thomas to write a libretto for an opera . Thomas spent the last nine or ten days of his third tour in New York mostly in the company of Reitell , with whom he had an affair . During this time Thomas fractured his arm falling down a flight of stairs when drunk . Reitell 's doctor , Milton Feltenstein , put his arm in plaster and treated him for gout and gastritis . 
 After returning home , Thomas worked on Under Milk Wood in Wales before sending the original manuscript to Douglas Cleverdon on 15 October 1953 . It was copied and returned to Thomas , who lost it in a pub in London and required a duplicate to take to America . Thomas flew to the States on 19 October 1953 for what would be his final tour . He died in New York before the BBC could record " Under Milk Wood " . Richard Burton starred in the first broadcast in 1954 , and was joined by Elizabeth Taylor in a subsequent film . In 1954 the play won the Prix Italia for literary or dramatic programmes . 
 Thomas 's last collection Collected Poems , 1934 – 1952 , published when he was 38 , won the Foyle poetry prize . Reviewing the volume , critic Philip Toynbee declared that " Thomas is the greatest living poet in the English language " . Thomas 's father died from pneumonia just before Christmas 1952 . In the first few months of 1953 his sister died from liver cancer , one of his patrons took an overdose of sleeping pills , three friends died at an early age and Caitlin had an abortion . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Thomas arrived in New York on 20 October 1953 to undertake another tour of poetry reading and talks , organised by Brinnin . He was ill , complaining of chest trouble and gout while still in Britain , though there is no record he received medical treatment for either condition . He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor , relying on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts . His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton , a few days before he left for New York , was interrupted by a blackout . On his last night in London , he had another , in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice . The next day , he visited a doctor for a smallpox vaccination certificate . 
 His first appearance was planned to be at a rehearsal of Under Milk Wood at the Poetry Centre . Brinnin , who was director of the Poetry Centre , did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write . He handed responsibility to his assistant , Liz Reitell , who was keen to see Thomas for the first time since their three @-@ week romance early in the year . She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance , as he " looked pale , delicate and shaky , not his usual robust self . " Thomas told her he had had a terrible week , had missed her terribly and wanted to go to bed with her . Despite Reitell 's previous misgivings about their relationship , they spent the rest of the day and night together . After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel , Thomas took the first rehearsal of Under Milk Wood . They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village , before returning to the Chelsea Hotel . 
 The next day Reitell invited him to her apartment but he declined . They went sight @-@ seeing , but Thomas was unwell and retired to his bed for the rest of the afternoon . Reitell gave him half a grain ( 32 @.@ 4 milligrams ) of <unk> to help him sleep and spent the night at the hotel with him . Two days later , on 23 October , Herb Hannum , a friend from an earlier trip , noticed how sick Thomas looked and suggested an appointment with Feltenstein before the performances of Under Milk Wood that evening . Feltenstein administered injections and Thomas made it through the two performances , but collapsed immediately afterwards . Reitell later said that Feltenstein was " rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything " . 
 On the evening of 27 October , Thomas attended his 39th birthday party but felt unwell and returned to his hotel after an hour . The next day he took part in Poetry And The Film , a recorded symposium at Cinema 16 , with panellists Amos Vogel , Arthur Miller , Maya Deren , Parker Tyler , and Willard Maas . 
 A turning point came on 2 November . Air pollution in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses , such as Thomas had . By the end of the month , over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog . On 3 November , Thomas spent most of the day in bed drinking . He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments . After returning to the hotel , he went out again for a drink at 2 am . After drinking at the White Horse , a pub he had found through Scottish poet Ruthven Todd , Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea , declaring , " I 've had 18 straight whiskies . I think that 's the record ! " The barman , and the owner of the pub who served him , later commented that Thomas could not have imbibed more than half that amount . Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November . When phoned at the Chelsea that morning , he said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement . Later he went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and , feeling sick again , returned to the hotel . Feltenstein came to see him three times that day , administering the steroid ACTH by injection and , on his third visit , half a grain ( 32 @.@ 4 milligrams ) of morphine sulphate , which affected his breathing . Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice . He suggested she get male assistance , so she called upon the painter Jack <unk> , who arrived before 11 pm . At midnight on 5 November , Thomas 's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue . An ambulance was summoned . 
 Thomas was admitted to the emergency ward at St Vincent 's Hospital at 1 : 58 am . He was comatose , and his medical notes state that the " impression upon admission was acute alcoholic encephalopathy damage to the brain by alcohol , for which the patient was treated without response " . Caitlin flew to America the following day and was taken to the hospital , by which time a tracheotomy had been performed . Her reported first words were , " Is the bloody man dead yet ? " She was allowed to see Thomas only for 40 minutes in the morning but returned in the afternoon and , in a drunken rage , threatened to kill Brinnin . When she became uncontrollable , she was put in a straitjacket and committed , by Feltenstein , to the River Crest private psychiatric detox clinic on Long Island . 
 Thomas died at noon on 9 November , still in a coma . A post mortem gave the primary cause of death as pneumonia , with pressure on the brain and a fatty liver as contributing factors . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Rumours circulated of a brain haemorrhage , followed by competing reports that he had been mugged and even that he had drunk himself to death . Later , there was speculation about drugs and diabetes . At the post @-@ mortem , the pathologist found three causes of death – pneumonia , brain swelling and a fatty liver . Despite his heavy drinking his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis . 
 Dylan 's legacy as the " doomed poet " was cemented with the publication of Brinnin 's 1955 biography Dylan Thomas in America , which focuses on his last few years and paints a picture of him as a drunk and a philanderer . Later biographies are critical of Brinnin 's view , especially his coverage of Thomas 's death . David Thomas in Fatal Neglect : Who Killed Dylan Thomas ? claims that Brinnin , along with Reitell and Feltenstein , were culpable . FitzGibbon 's 1965 biography ignores Thomas 's heavy drinking and skims over his death , giving just two pages in his detailed book to Thomas 's demise . Ferris in his 1989 biography includes Thomas 's heavy drinking , but is more critical of those around him in his final days and does not draw the conclusion that he drank himself to death . Feltenstein 's role and actions have been criticised by many sources , especially his incorrect diagnosis of delirium tremens and the high dose of morphine he administered . Dr B. W. Murphy and Dr C. G. de Gutierrez @-@ Mahoney , the doctors who treated Thomas while at St. Vincents , concluded that Feltenstein 's failure to see that Thomas was gravely ill and have him admitted to hospital sooner , " was even more culpable than his use of morphine " . 
 Following his death , Thomas 's body was brought back to Wales for burial in the village churchyard at Laugharne . Thomas 's funeral , which Brinnin did not attend , took place at St Martin 's Church in Laugharne on 24 November . Thomas 's coffin was carried by six friends from the village . Caitlin , without her customary hat , walked behind the coffin , with his childhood friend Daniel Jones at her arm and her mother by her side . The procession to the church was filmed and the wake took place at Brown 's Hotel . Thomas 's obituary in The Times was written by fellow poet and long @-@ time friend Vernon Watkins . 
 His widow , Caitlin , died in 1994 and was buried alongside him . Thomas 's father " DJ " died on 16 December 1952 and his mother Florence in August 1958 . Thomas 's elder son , Llewelyn , died in 2000 , his daughter , Aeronwy in 2009 and his youngest son Colm in 2012 . 
 Caitlin Thomas 's autobiographies , Caitlin Thomas – Leftover Life to Kill ( 1957 ) and My Life with Dylan Thomas : Double Drink Story ( 1997 ) , describe the destructive effect of alcoholism on the poet and to their relationship . " But ours was a drink story , not a love story , just like millions of others . Our one and only true love was drink " , she wrote and " The bar was our altar " . Biographer Andrew Lycett ascribed the demise of Thomas 's health to an alcoholic co @-@ dependent relationship with his wife , who deeply resented his extramarital affairs . Thomas died intestate with assets to the value of £ 100 . 
 = = Poetry = = 
 = = = Poetic style and influences = = = 
 Thomas ' refusal to align with any literary group or movement has made him and his work difficult to categorize . Although influenced by the modern symbolism and surrealism movement he refused to follow its creed . Instead Thomas is viewed as part of the modernism and romanticism movements , though attempts to pigeon @-@ hole him within a particular neo @-@ romantic school have been unsuccessful . Elder Olson , in his 1954 critical study of Thomas 's poetry , wrote " ... a further characteristic which distinguished Thomas 's work from that of other poets . It was unclassifiable . " Olson continued that in a postmodern age that continually attempted to demand that poetry have social reference , none could be found in Thomas 's work , and that his work was so obscure that critics could not explicate it . 
 Thomas 's verbal style played against strict verse forms , such as in the villanelle " Do not go gentle into that good night " . His images were carefully ordered in a patterned sequence , and his major theme was the unity of all life , the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations . Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity , and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity . He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth , love , procreation , new growth , death , and new life . Therefore , each image engenders its opposite . Thomas derived his closely woven , sometimes self @-@ contradictory images from the Bible , Welsh folklore , preaching , and Sigmund Freud . Explaining the source of his imagery , Thomas wrote in a letter to Glyn Jones : " My own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one , based , as it is , on a preconceived symbolism derived ( I 'm afraid all this sounds wooly and pretentious ) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy " . 
 Thomas 's early poetry was noted for its verbal density , alliteration , sprung rhythm and internal rhyme , and he was described by some critics as having been influenced by the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins . This is attributed to Hopkins , who taught himself Welsh and who used sprung verse , bringing some features of Welsh poetic metre into his work . When Henry Treece wrote to Thomas comparing his style to that of Hopkins , Thomas wrote back denying any such influence . One poet Thomas greatly admired , and who is regarded as an influence , was Thomas Hardy . When Thomas travelled in America , he recited Hardy 's work in his readings . 
 Other poets from whom critics believe Thomas drew influence include James Joyce , Arthur Rimbaud and D. H. Lawrence . William York Tindall , in his 1962 study , A Reader 's Guide to Dylan Thomas , finds comparison between Thomas 's and Joyce 's wordplay , while he notes the themes of rebirth and nature are common to the works of Lawrence and Thomas . Although Thomas described himself as the " Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive " , he stated that the phrase " Swansea 's Rimbaud " was coined by poet Roy Campbell . Critics have explored the connection between the creation of Thomas 's mythological pasts into his works such as " The Orchards " , which Ann Elizabeth Mayer believes reflects the Welsh myths of the Mabinogion . Thomas 's poetry is notable for its musicality , most clear in " Fern Hill " , " In Country Sleep " , " Ballad of the Long @-@ legged Bait " and " In the White Giant 's Thigh " from Under Milk Wood . 
 Thomas once confided that the poems which had most influenced him were Mother Goose rhymes which his parents taught him when he was a child : 
 I should say I wanted to write poetry in the beginning because I had fallen in love with words . The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them . The words alone . What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance ... I fell in love , that is the only expression I can think of , at once , and am still at the mercy of words , though sometimes now , knowing a little of their behaviour very well , I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then , which they appear to enjoy . I tumbled for words at once . And , when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself , and , later , to read other verses and ballads , I knew that I had discovered the most important things , to me , that could be ever . 
 Thomas was an accomplished writer of prose poetry , with collections such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog ( 1940 ) and Quite Early One Morning ( 1954 ) showing he was capable of writing moving short stories . His first published prose work was After the Fair , printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934 . Jacob Korg believes that Thomas 's fiction work can be classified into two main bodies , vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and , after 1939 , more straightforward narratives . Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form , which allowed him to produce complex , <unk> narratives that do not allow the reader to rest . 
 = = = As a ' Welsh ' poet = = = 
 Thomas disliked being regarded as a provincial poet , and decried any notion of ' Welshness ' in his poetry . When he wrote to Stephen Spender in 1952 , thanking him for a review of his Collected Poems , he added " Oh , & I forgot . I 'm not influenced by Welsh bardic poetry . I can 't read Welsh . " Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales . Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing , and John Ackerman argues that " His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background " . Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked " in a fanatically narrow groove , although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings . The groove of direct hereditary descent in the land of his birth , which he never in thought , and hardly in body , moved out of . " 
 Head of Programmes Wales at the BBC , Aneirin Talfan Davies , who commissioned several of Thomas 's early radio talks , believed that the poet 's " whole attitude is that of the medieval bards . " Kenneth O. Morgan counter @-@ argues that it is a ' difficult enterprise ' to find traces of <unk> ( harmony ) or <unk> <unk> ( tongue @-@ craft ) in Thomas 's poetry . Instead he believes his work , especially his earlier more autobiographical poems , are rooted in a changing country which echoes the Welshness of the past and the Anglicisation of the new industrial nation : " rural and urban , chapel @-@ going and profane , Welsh and English , <unk> and deeply compassionate . " Fellow poet and critic Glyn Jones believed that any traces of <unk> in Thomas 's work was accidental , although he felt Thomas consciously employed one element of Welsh metrics ; that of counting syllables per line instead of feet . Constantine FitzGibbon , Thomas 's first in @-@ depth biographer , wrote " No major English poet has ever been as Welsh as Dylan " . 
 Although Thomas had a deep connection with Wales , he disliked Welsh nationalism . He once wrote , " Land of my fathers , and my fathers can keep it " . While often attributed to Thomas himself , this line actually comes from the character Owen Morgan @-@ Vaughan , in the screenplay Thomas wrote for the 1948 British melodrama The Three Weird Sisters . Robert Pocock , a friend from the BBC , recalled " I only once heard Dylan express an opinion on Welsh Nationalism . He used three words . Two of them were Welsh Nationalism . " Although not expressed as strongly , Glyn Jones believed that he and Thomas 's friendship cooled in the later years as he had not ' rejected enough ' of the elements that Thomas disliked – " Welsh nationalism and a sort of hill farm morality " . <unk> , in a letter to <unk> Rhys , editor of literary magazine Wales , Thomas 's father wrote that he was " afraid Dylan isn 't much of a Welshman " . Though FitzGibbon asserts that Thomas 's negativity towards Welsh nationalism was fostered by his father 's hostility towards the Welsh language . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Thomas 's work and stature as a poet have been much debated by critics and biographers since his death . Critical studies have been clouded by Thomas 's personality and mythology , especially his drunken persona and death in New York . When Seamus Heaney gave an Oxford lecture on the poet he opened by addressing the assembly , " Dylan Thomas is now as much a case history as a chapter in the history of poetry " , querying how ' Thomas the Poet ' is one of his forgotten attributes . David Holbrook , who has written three books about Thomas , stated in his 1962 publication <unk> Revisited , " the strangest feature of Dylan Thomas 's notoriety @-@ not that he is bogus , but that attitudes to poetry attached themselves to him which not only threaten the prestige , effectiveness and accessibility to English poetry , but also destroyed his true voice and , at last , him . " The Poetry Archive notes that " Dylan Thomas ' detractors accuse him of being drunk on language as well as whiskey , but whilst there 's no doubt that the sound of language is central to his style , he was also a disciplined writer who re @-@ drafted obsessively " . 
 Many critics have argued that Thomas 's work is too narrow and that he suffers from verbal extravagance . Those that have championed his work have found the criticism baffling . Robert Lowell wrote in 1947 , " Nothing could be more wrongheaded than the English disputes about Dylan Thomas 's greatness ... He is a dazzling obscure writer who can be enjoyed without understanding . " Kenneth Rexroth said , on reading Eighteen Poems , " The reeling excitement of a poetry @-@ intoxicated schoolboy smote the Philistine as hard a blow with one small book as Swinburne had with Poems and Ballads . " Philip Larkin in a letter to Kingsley Amis in 1948 , wrote that " no one can ' stick words into us like pins ' ... like he [ Thomas ] can " , but followed that by stating that he " doesn 't use his words to any advantage " . Amis was far harsher , finding little of merit in his work . In 1956 , the publication of the anthology New Lines featuring works by the British collective The Movement , which included Amis and Larkin amongst its number , set out a vision of modern poetry that was damning towards the poets of the 1940s . Thomas 's work in particular was criticised . David Lodge , writing about The Movement in 1981 stated " Dylan Thomas was made to stand for everything they detest , verbal obscurity , metaphysical pretentiousness , and romantic <unk> " . 
 Despite criticism by sections of academia , Thomas 's work has been embraced by readers more so than many of his contemporaries , and is one of the few modern poets whose name is recognised by the general public . In 2009 , over 18 @,@ 000 votes were cast in a BBC poll to find the UK 's favourite poet ; Thomas was placed 10th . Several of his poems have passed into the cultural mainstream , and his work has been used by authors , musicians and film and television writers . The BBC Radio programme , Desert Island Discs , in which guests usually choose their favourite songs , has heard 50 participants select a Dylan Thomas recording . John Goodby states that this popularity with the reading public allows Thomas 's work to be classed as vulgar and common . He also cites that despite a brief period during the 1960s when Thomas was considered a cultural icon , that the poet has been marginalized in critical circles due to his exuberance , in both life and work , and his refusal to know his place . Goodby believes that Thomas has been mainly snubbed since the 1970s and has become " ... an embarrassment to twentieth @-@ century poetry criticism " his work failing to fit standard narratives and is thus ignored rather than studied . 
 = = Memorials = = 
 In Swansea 's maritime quarter are the Dylan Thomas Theatre , home of the Swansea Little Theatre of which Thomas was once a member , and the former Guildhall built in 1825 and now occupied by the Dylan Thomas Centre , a literature centre , where exhibitions and lectures are held and setting for the annual Dylan Thomas Festival . Outside the centre stands a bronze statue of Thomas , by John Doubleday . Another monument to Thomas stands in Cwmdonkin Park , one of his favourite childhood haunts , close to his birthplace . The memorial is a small rock in an enclosed garden within the park inscribed with the closing lines from Fern Hill . 
 Thomas 's home in Laugharne , the Boathouse , is a museum run by Carmarthenshire County Council . Thomas 's writing shed is also preserved . In 2004 , the Dylan Thomas Prize was created in his honour , awarded to the best published writer in English under the age of 30 . In 2005 , the Dylan Thomas Screenplay Award was established . The prize , administered by the Dylan Thomas Centre , is awarded at the annual Swansea Bay Film Festival . In 1982 a plaque was unveiled in Poets ' Corner , Westminster Abbey . The plaque is also inscribed with the last two lines of Fern Hill . 
 In 2014 , to celebrate the centenary of Thomas ' birth , the British Council Wales undertook a year long programme of cultural and educational works . Highlights included a touring replica of Thomas ' work shed , Sir Peter Blake 's exhibition of illustrations based on Under Milk Wood and a 36 @-@ hour marathon of readings which saw the likes of Michael Sheen and Sir Ian McKellen performing Thomas ' work . The Royal Patron of The Dylan Thomas 100 Festival was Charles , Prince of Wales , who made a recording of Fern Hill for the event .

 = Edinburgh Castle = 
 Edinburgh Castle is a historic fortress which dominates the skyline of the city of Edinburgh , Scotland , from its position on the Castle Rock . Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age ( 2nd century AD ) , although the nature of the early settlement is unclear . There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century , and the site continued to be a royal residence until 1633 . From the 15th century the castle 's residential role declined , and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison . Its importance as a part of Scotland 's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards , and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half . As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland , Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite Rising of 1745 . Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1100 @-@ year @-@ old history , giving it a claim to having been " the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world " . 
 Few of the present buildings pre @-@ date the Lang Siege of the 16th century , when the medieval defences were largely destroyed by artillery bombardment . The most notable exceptions are St Margaret 's Chapel from the early 12th century , which is regarded as the oldest building in Edinburgh , the Royal Palace and the early @-@ 16th @-@ century Great Hall , although the interiors have been much altered from the mid @-@ Victorian period onwards . The castle also houses the Scottish regalia , known as the Honours of Scotland and is the site of the Scottish National War Memorial and the National War Museum of Scotland . The British Army is still responsible for some parts of the castle , although its presence is now largely ceremonial and administrative . Some of the castle buildings house regimental museums which contribute to its presentation as a tourist attraction . 
 The castle , in the care of Historic Scotland , is Scotland 's most @-@ visited paid tourist attraction , with over 1 @.@ 4 million visitors in 2013 . As the backdrop to the Edinburgh Military Tattoo during the annual Edinburgh International Festival the castle has become a recognisable symbol of Edinburgh and of Scotland and indeed , it is Edinburgh 's most frequently visited visitor attraction - according to the Edinburgh Visitor Survey , more than 70 % of leisure visitors to Edinburgh visited the castle .

 = = = Pre @-@ history of the Castle Rock = = = 
 = = = = Geology = = = = 
 The castle stands upon the plug of an extinct volcano , which is estimated to have risen about 350 million years ago during the lower Carboniferous period . The Castle Rock is the remains of a volcanic pipe , which cut through the surrounding sedimentary rock before cooling to form very hard dolerite , a type of basalt . Subsequent glacial erosion was resisted by the dolerite , which protected the softer rock to the east , leaving a crag and tail formation . 
 The summit of the Castle Rock is 130 metres ( 430 ft ) above sea level , with rocky cliffs to the south , west and north , rising to a height of 80 metres ( 260 ft ) above the surrounding landscape . This means that the only readily accessible route to the castle lies to the east , where the ridge slopes more gently . The defensive advantage of such a site is self @-@ evident , but the geology of the rock also presents difficulties , since basalt is extremely impermeable . Providing water to the Upper Ward of the castle was problematic , and despite the sinking of a 28 @-@ metre ( 92 ft ) deep well , the water supply often ran out during drought or siege , for example during the Lang Siege in 1573 . 
 = = = = Earliest habitation = = = = 
 Archaeological investigation has yet to establish when the Castle Rock was first used as a place of human habitation . There is no record of any Roman interest in the location during General Agricola 's invasion of northern Britain near the end of the 1st century AD . Ptolemy 's map of the 2nd century AD shows a settlement in the territory of the Votadini named " Alauna " , meaning " rock place " , making this possibly the earliest known name for the Castle Rock . This could , however , refer to another of the tribe 's hill forts in the area . The <unk> <unk> of Andrew of Wyntoun ( c . 1350 – c . 1423 ) , an early source for Scottish history , names " <unk> " ( Ebraucus ) , a legendary King of the Britons , as having " <unk> [ built ] <unk> " . According to the earlier chronicler , Geoffrey of Monmouth ( c . 1100 – c . 1155 ) , Ebraucus had fifty children by his twenty wives , and was the founder of " <unk> " ( York ) , " <unk> " ( Dumbarton ) and the " Maidens ' Castle " . The 16th @-@ century English writer John Stow ( c . 1525 – 1605 ) , credited Ebraucus with building " the Castell of Maidens called <unk> " in 989 BC . The name " Maidens ' Castle " ( Latin : Castra or Castellum <unk> ) occurs frequently up until the 16th century . It appears in charters of David I ( r.1124 – 1153 ) and his successors , although the reason for it is not known . William Camden 's survey of Britain , Britannia ( 1607 ) , records that " the <unk> called [ it ] Castle <unk> <unk> [ winged rock ] , the Scots , the Maidens Castle and the Virgins Castle , of <unk> young maidens of the Picts <unk> <unk> who were kept there in old time " . According to the 17th @-@ century antiquarian Father Richard Hay , the " maidens " were a group of nuns , who were ejected from the castle and replaced by canons , considered " fitter to live among soldiers " . However , this story was considered " apocryphal " by the 19th @-@ century antiquarian Daniel Wilson and has been ignored by historians since . The name may have been derived from a " Cult of the Nine Maidens " type of legend . Arthurian legends suggest that the site once held a shrine to Morgain la Fee , one of nine sisters . Later , St <unk> , said to be one of nine companions , reputedly invested a church at Edinburgh , as well as at Dumbarton and other places . Similar names are shared by many other Iron Age hillforts and may have simply described a castle that had never been taken by force or derived from an earlier Brittonic name like mag dun . 
 An archaeological excavation in the early 1990s uncovered evidence of the site having been settled during the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age , potentially making the Castle Rock the longest continually occupied site in Scotland . However , the extent of the finds was not particularly significant and was insufficient to draw any certain conclusions about the precise nature or scale of this earliest known phase of occupation . 
 The archaeological evidence is more reliable in respect of the Iron Age . Traditionally , it had been supposed that the tribes of central Scotland had made little or no use of the Castle Rock . Excavations at nearby <unk> Hill , Duddingston , Inveresk and Traprain Law had revealed relatively large settlements and it was supposed that these sites had been chosen in preference to the Castle Rock . However , the excavation in the 1990s pointed to the probable existence of an enclosed hill fort on the rock , although only the fringes of the site were excavated . House fragments revealed were similar to Iron Age dwellings previously found in Northumbria . 
 The 1990s dig revealed clear signs of habitation from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD , consistent with Ptolemy 's reference to " Alauna " . Signs of occupation included some Roman material , including pottery , bronzes and brooches , implying a possible trading relationship between the Votadini and the Romans beginning with Agricola 's northern campaign in AD 82 , and continuing through to the establishment of the Antonine Wall around AD 140 . The nature of the settlement in this period is inconclusive , but Driscoll and Yeoman suggest it may have been a broch , similar to the one at Edin 's Hall near Duns in the Scottish Borders . 
 = = = Early Middle Ages = = = 
 The castle does not re @-@ appear in contemporary historical records from the time of Ptolemy until around AD 600 . Then , in the epic Welsh poem Y Gododdin there is a reference to Din Eidyn , " the stronghold of Eidyn " . This has been generally assumed to refer to the Castle Rock . The poem tells of the Gododdin King Mynyddog Mwynfawr , and his band of warriors , who , after a year of feasting in their fortress , set out to do battle with the Angles at " <unk> " ( possibly Catterick ) in Yorkshire . Despite performing glorious deeds of valour and bravery , the poem relates that the Gododdin were massacred . 
 The Irish annals record that in 638 , after the events related in Y Gododdin , " <unk> " was besieged by the Angles under Oswald of Northumbria , and the Gododdin were defeated . The territory around Edinburgh then became part of the Kingdom of Northumbria , which was itself absorbed by England in the 10th century . Lothian became part of Scotland , during the reign of Indulf ( <unk> – 962 ) . 
 The archaeological evidence for the period in question is based entirely on the analysis of middens ( domestic refuse heaps ) , with no evidence of structures . Few conclusions can therefore be derived about the status of the settlement during this period , although the midden deposits show no clear break since Roman times . 
 = = = High Middle Ages = = = 
 The first documentary reference to a castle at Edinburgh is John of Fordun 's account of the death of King Malcolm III . Fordun describes his widow , the future Saint Margaret , as residing at the " Castle of Maidens " when she is brought news of his death in November 1093 . Fordun 's account goes on to relate how Margaret died of grief within days , and how Malcolm 's brother Donald Bane laid siege to the castle . However , Fordun 's chronicle was not written until the later 14th century , and the near @-@ contemporary account of the life of St Margaret by Bishop Turgot makes no mention of a castle . During the reigns of Malcolm III and his sons , Edinburgh Castle became one of the most significant royal centres in Scotland . Malcolm 's son King Edgar died here in 1107 . 
 Malcolm 's youngest son , King David I ( r.1124 – 1153 ) , developed Edinburgh as a seat of royal power principally through his administrative reforms ( termed by some modern scholars the Davidian Revolution ) . Between 1139 and 1150 , David held an assembly of nobles and churchmen , a precursor to the parliament of Scotland , at the castle . Any buildings or defences would probably have been of timber , although two stone buildings are documented as having existed in the 12th century . Of these , St. Margaret 's Chapel remains at the summit of the rock . The second was a church , dedicated to St. Mary , which stood on the site of the Scottish National War Memorial . Given that the southern part of the Upper Ward ( where Crown Square is now sited ) was not suited to being built upon until the construction of the vaults in the 15th century , it seems probable that any earlier buildings would have been located towards the northern part of the rock ; that is around the area where St. Margaret 's Chapel stands . This has led to a suggestion that the chapel is the last remnant of a square , stone keep , which would have formed the bulk of the 12th @-@ century fortification . The structure may have been similar to the keep of Carlisle Castle , which David I began after 1135 . 
 David 's successor King Malcolm IV ( <unk> – 1165 ) reportedly stayed at Edinburgh more than at any other location . But in 1174 , King William " the Lion " ( <unk> – 1214 ) was captured by the English at the Battle of Alnwick . He was forced to sign the Treaty of Falaise to secure his release , in return for surrendering Edinburgh Castle , along with the castles of Berwick , Roxburgh and Stirling , to the English King , Henry II . The castle was occupied by the English for twelve years , until 1186 , when it was returned to William as the dowry of his English bride , Ermengarde de Beaumont , who had been chosen for him by King Henry . By the end of the 12th century , Edinburgh Castle was established as the main repository of Scotland 's official state papers . 
 = = = Wars of Scottish Independence = = = 
 A century later , in 1286 , on the death of King Alexander III , the throne of Scotland became vacant . Edward I of England was appointed to adjudicate the competing claims for the Scottish crown , but used the opportunity to attempt to establish himself as the feudal overlord of Scotland . During the negotiations , Edward stayed briefly at Edinburgh Castle and may have received homage there from the Scottish nobles . 
 In March 1296 , Edward I launched an invasion of Scotland , unleashing the First War of Scottish Independence . Edinburgh Castle soon came under English control , surrendering after a three days long bombardment . Following the siege , Edward had many of the Scottish legal records and royal treasures moved from the castle to England . A large garrison numbering 325 men was installed in 1300 . Edward also brought to Scotland his master builders of the Welsh castles , including Thomas de Houghton and Master Walter of Hereford , both of whom travelled from Wales to Edinburgh . After the death of Edward I in 1307 , however , England 's control over Scotland weakened . On 14 March 1314 , a surprise night attack by Thomas Randolph , 1st Earl of Moray recaptured the castle . John Barbour 's narrative poem The Brus relates how a party of thirty hand @-@ picked men were guided by one William Francis , a member of the garrison who knew of a route along the north face of the Castle Rock and a place where the wall might be scaled . Making the difficult ascent , Randolph 's men scaled the wall , surprised the garrison and took control . Robert the Bruce immediately ordered the destruction of the castle 's defences to prevent its re @-@ occupation by the English . Four months later , his army secured victory at the Battle of Bannockburn . 
 After Bruce 's death in 1329 , Edward III of England determined to renew the attempted subjugation of Scotland and supported the claim of Edward Balliol , son of the former King John Balliol , over that of Bruce 's young son David II . Edward invaded in 1333 , marking the start of the Second War of Scottish Independence , and the English forces reoccupied and refortified Edinburgh Castle in 1335 , holding it until 1341 . This time , the Scottish assault was led by William Douglas , Lord of Liddesdale . Douglas 's party disguised themselves as merchants from Leith bringing supplies to the garrison . Driving a cart into the entrance , they halted it there to prevent the gates closing . A larger force hidden nearby rushed to join them and the castle was retaken . The English garrison , numbering 100 , were all killed . 
 = = = David 's Tower and the 15th century = = = 
 The 1357 Treaty of Berwick brought the Wars of Independence to a close . David II resumed his rule and set about rebuilding Edinburgh Castle which became his principal seat of government . David 's Tower was begun around 1367 , and was incomplete when David died at the castle in 1371 . It was completed by his successor , Robert II , in the 1370s . The tower stood on the site of the present Half Moon Battery and was connected by a section of curtain wall to the smaller Constable 's Tower , a round tower built between 1375 and 1379 where the Portcullis Gate now stands . 
 In the early 15th century , another English invasion , this time under Henry IV , reached Edinburgh Castle and began a siege , but eventually withdrew due to lack of supplies . From 1437 , Sir William Crichton was Keeper of Edinburgh Castle , and soon after became Chancellor of Scotland . In an attempt to gain the regency of Scotland , Crichton sought to break the power of the Douglases , the principal noble family in the kingdom . The sixteen @-@ year @-@ old William Douglas , 6th Earl of Douglas and his younger brother David were summoned to Edinburgh Castle in November 1440 . After the so @-@ called " Black Dinner " had taken place in David 's Tower , both boys were summarily executed on trumped @-@ up charges in the presence of the ten @-@ year @-@ old King James II ( <unk> – 1460 ) . Douglas ' supporters subsequently besieged the castle , inflicting damage . Construction continued throughout this period , with the area now known as Crown Square being laid out over vaults in the 1430s . Royal apartments were built , forming the nucleus of the later palace block , and a Great Hall was in existence by 1458 . In 1464 , access to the castle was improved when the current approach road up the north @-@ east side of the rock was created to allow easier movement of the royal artillery train in and out of the area now known as the Upper Ward . 
 In 1479 , Alexander Stewart , Duke of Albany , was imprisoned in David 's Tower for plotting against his brother , King James III ( <unk> – 1488 ) . He escaped by getting his guards drunk , then lowering himself from a window on a rope . Albany fled to France , then England , where he allied himself with King Edward IV . In 1482 , Albany marched into Scotland with Richard , Duke of Gloucester ( later King Richard III ) and an English army . James III was trapped in the castle from 22 July to 29 September 1482 until he successfully negotiated a settlement . 
 During the 15th century the castle was increasingly used as an arsenal and armaments factory . The first known purchase of a gun was in 1384 , and the " great bombard " Mons Meg was delivered to Edinburgh in 1457 . The first recorded mention of an armoury for the manufacture of guns occurs in 1474 , and by 1498 the master gunner Robert Borthwick was casting bronze guns at Edinburgh . By 1511 Edinburgh was the principal foundry in Scotland , supplanting Stirling Castle , with Scottish and European smiths working under Borthwick , who by 1512 was appointed " master melter of the king 's guns " . Their output included guns for the Scottish flagship , the " Great Michael " , and the " Seven Sisters " , a set of cannon captured by the English at Flodden in 1513 . Sir Thomas Howard , England 's Lord Admiral , admired their graceful shape and brilliant finish , declaring them the most beautiful [ cannon ] for their size and length that he had ever seen . From 1510 Dutch craftsmen were also producing hand culverins , an early firearm . After Flodden , Borthwick continued his work , producing an unknown number of guns , of which none survive . He was succeeded by French smiths , who began manufacturing <unk> ( another type of firearm ) in the 1550s , and by 1541 the castle had a stock of 413 . 
 Meanwhile , the royal family began to stay more frequently at the Abbey of Holyrood , about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the castle . Around the end of the fifteenth century , King James IV ( <unk> – 1513 ) built Holyroodhouse , by the abbey , as his principal Edinburgh residence , and the castle 's role as a royal home subsequently declined . James IV did , however , construct the Great Hall , which was completed in the early 16th century . 
 = = = 16th century and the Lang Siege = = = 
 James IV was killed in battle at Flodden Field , on 9 September 1513 . Expecting the English to press their advantage , the Scots hastily constructed a town wall around Edinburgh and augmented the castle 's defences . Robert Borthwick and a Frenchman , Antoine d <unk> , were involved in designing new artillery defences and fortifications in 1514 , though it appears from lack of evidence that little of the planned work was carried out . Three years later , King James V ( <unk> – 1542 ) , still only five years old , was brought to the castle for safety . Upon his death 25 years later , the crown passed to his week @-@ old daughter , Mary , Queen of Scots . English invasions followed , as King Henry VIII attempted to force a dynastic marriage on Scotland , although Edinburgh Castle remained largely unaffected . Following these campaigns , <unk> included an earthen angle @-@ bastion , known as the Spur , of the type known as trace italienne , one of the earliest examples in Britain . It may have been designed by <unk> Ubaldini , an Italian engineer from the court of Henry II of France , and was said to have the arms of France carved on it . James V 's widow , Mary of Guise , acted as regent from 1554 until her death at the castle in 1560 . 
 The following year , the Catholic Mary , Queen of Scots , returned from France to begin her reign , which was marred by crises and quarrels amongst the powerful Protestant Scottish nobility . In 1565 , the Queen made an unpopular marriage with Henry Stuart , Lord Darnley , and the following year , in a small room of the Palace at Edinburgh Castle , she gave birth to their son James , who would later be King of both Scotland and England . Mary 's reign was , however , brought to an abrupt end . Three months after the murder of Darnley at Kirk o ' Field in 1567 , she married James Hepburn , 4th Earl of Bothwell , one of the chief murder suspects . A large proportion of the nobility rebelled , resulting ultimately in the imprisonment and forced abdication of Mary at Loch Leven Castle . She escaped and fled to England , but some of the nobility remained faithful to her cause . Edinburgh Castle was initially handed by its Captain , James Balfour , to the Regent Moray , who had forced Mary 's abdication and now held power in the name of the infant King James VI . Shortly after the Battle of Langside , in May 1568 , Moray appointed Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange Keeper of the Castle . 
 Grange was a trusted lieutenant of the Regent , but after Moray 's murder in January 1570 his allegiance to the King 's cause began to waver . Intermittent civil war continued between the supporters of the two monarchs , and in April 1571 Dumbarton Castle fell to " the King 's men " . Under the influence of William Maitland of Lethington , Mary 's secretary , Grange changed sides , occupying the town and castle of Edinburgh for Queen Mary , and against the new regent , the Earl of Lennox . The stand @-@ off which followed was not resolved until two years later , and became known as the " Lang Siege " , from the Scots word for " long " . Hostilities began in May , with a month @-@ long siege of the town , and a second short siege in October . <unk> and skirmishing continued meanwhile , and Grange continued to refortify the castle . The King 's party appealed to Elizabeth I of England for assistance , as they lacked the artillery and money required to reduce the castle , and feared that Grange would receive aid from France and the Duke of Alba in the Spanish Netherlands . Elizabeth sent ambassadors to negotiate , and in July 1572 a truce was agreed and the blockade lifted . The town was effectively surrendered to the King 's party , with Grange confined to the castle . 
 The truce expired on 1 January 1573 , and Grange began bombarding the town . His supplies of powder and shot , however , were running low , and despite having 40 cannon available , there were only seven gunners in the garrison . The King 's forces , now with the Earl of Morton in charge as regent , were making headway with plans for a siege . Trenches were dug to surround the castle , and St Margaret 's Well was poisoned . By February , all Queen Mary 's other supporters had surrendered to the Regent , but Grange resolved to resist despite water shortages within the castle . The garrison continued to bombard the town , killing a number of citizens . They also made sorties to set fires , burning 100 houses in the town and then firing on anyone attempting to put out the flames . 
 In April , a force of around 1 @,@ 000 English troops , led by Sir William Drury , arrived in Edinburgh . They were followed by 27 cannon from Berwick @-@ upon @-@ Tweed , including one that had been cast within Edinburgh Castle and captured by the English at Flodden . The English troops built an artillery emplacement on Castle Hill , immediately facing the east walls of the castle , and five others to the north , west and south . By 17 May these batteries were ready , and the bombardment began . Over the next 12 days the gunners dispatched around 3 @,@ 000 shots at the castle . On 22 May , the south wall of David 's Tower collapsed , and the next day the Constable 's Tower also fell . The debris blocked the castle entrance , as well as the Fore Well , although this had already run dry . On 26 May , the English attacked and captured the Spur , the outer fortification of the castle , which had been isolated by the collapse . The following day Grange emerged from the castle by a ladder after calling for a ceasefire to allow negotiations for a surrender to take place . When it was made clear that he would not be allowed to go free even if he ended the siege , Grange resolved to continue the resistance , but the garrison threatened to mutiny . He therefore arranged for Drury and his men to enter the castle on 28 May , preferring to surrender to the English rather than the Regent Morton . Edinburgh Castle was handed over to George Douglas of Parkhead , the Regent 's brother , and the garrison were allowed to go free . In contrast , Kirkcaldy of Grange , his brother James and two jewellers , James Mossman and James <unk> , who had been minting coins in Mary 's name inside the castle , were hanged at the Cross in Edinburgh on 3 August . 
 = = = Nova Scotia and Civil War = = = 
 Much of the castle was subsequently rebuilt by Regent Morton , including the Spur , the new Half Moon Battery and the Portcullis Gate . Some of these works were supervised by William MacDowall , the master of work who fifteen years earlier had repaired David 's Tower . The Half Moon Battery , while impressive in size , is considered by historians to have been an ineffective and outdated artillery fortification . This may have been due to a shortage of resources , although the battery 's position obscuring the ancient David 's Tower and enhancing the prominence of the palace block , has been seen as a significant decision . 
 The battered palace block remained unused , particularly after James VI departed to become King of England in 1603 . James had repairs carried out in 1584 , and in 1615 – 1616 more extensive repairs were carried out in preparation for his return visit to Scotland . The mason William Wallace and master of works James Murray introduced an early Scottish example of the double @-@ pile block . The principal external features were the three , three @-@ storey oriel windows on the east façade , facing the town and emphasising that this was a palace rather than just a place of defence . During his visit in 1617 , James held court in the refurbished palace block , but still preferred to sleep at Holyrood . 
 In 1621 , King James granted Sir William Alexander the land in North America between New England and Newfoundland , as Nova Scotia ( " New Scotland " ) . To promote the settlement and plantation of the new territory , the Baronetage of Nova Scotia was created in 1624 . Under Scots Law , baronets had to " take sasine " by symbolically receiving the earth and stone of the land of which they were baronet . To make this possible , since Nova Scotia was so distant , the King declared that sasine could be taken either in the new province or alternatively " at the castle of Edinburgh as the most eminent and principal place of Scotland . " 
 James ' successor , King Charles I , visited Edinburgh Castle only once , hosting a feast in the Great Hall and staying the night before his Scottish coronation in 1633 . This was the last occasion that a reigning monarch resided in the castle . In 1639 , in response to Charles ' attempts to impose Episcopacy on the Scottish Church , civil war broke out between the King 's forces and the Presbyterian Covenanters . The Covenanters , led by Alexander Leslie , captured Edinburgh Castle after a short siege , although it was restored to Charles after the Peace of Berwick in June the same year . The peace was short @-@ lived , however , and the following year the Covenanters took the castle again , this time after a three @-@ month siege , during which the garrison ran out of supplies . The Spur was badly damaged , and was demolished in the 1640s . The Royalist commander James Graham , 1st Marquis of Montrose was imprisoned here after his capture in 1650 . 
 In May 1650 , the Covenanters signed the Treaty of Breda , allying themselves with the exiled Charles II against the English Parliamentarians , who had executed his father the previous year . In response to the Scots proclaiming Charles King , Oliver Cromwell launched an invasion of Scotland , defeating the Covenanter army at Dunbar in September . Edinburgh Castle was taken after a three @-@ month siege , which caused further damage . The Governor of the Castle , Colonel Walter Dundas , surrendered to Cromwell despite having enough supplies to hold out , allegedly from a desire to change sides . 
 = = = Garrison fortress : Jacobites and prisoners of war = = = 
 After his Restoration in 1660 , Charles II opted to maintain a full @-@ time standing army based on Cromwell 's New Model Army . From this time until 1923 , a garrison was continuously maintained at the castle . The medieval royal castle was transformed into a garrison fortress , but continued to see military and political action . The Marquis of Argyll was imprisoned here in 1661 , when King Charles II settled old scores with his enemies following his return to the throne . Twenty years later , Argyll 's son , the 9th Earl of Argyll , was also imprisoned in the castle for religious Nonconformism in the reign of King James VII . He escaped by disguising himself as his sister 's footman , but was recaptured and returned to the castle after his failed rebellion to oust James from the throne in 1685 . 
 James VII was deposed and exiled by the Glorious Revolution of 1688 , which installed William of Orange as King of England . Not long after , in early 1689 , the Estates of Scotland , after convening to accept William formally as their new king , demanded that Duke of Gordon , Governor of the Castle , surrender the fortress . Gordon , who had been appointed by James VII as a fellow Catholic , refused . In March 1689 , the castle was blockaded by 7 @,@ 000 troops against a garrison of 160 men , further weakened by religious disputes . On 18 March , Viscount Dundee , intent on raising a rebellion in the Highlands , climbed up the western side of the Castle Rock to urge Gordon to hold the castle against the new King . Gordon agreed , but during the ensuing siege he refused to fire upon the town , while the besiegers inflicted little damage on the castle . Despite Dundee 's initial successes in the north , Gordon eventually surrendered on 14 June , due to dwindling supplies and having lost 70 men during the three @-@ month siege . Under the terms of the Acts of Union , which joined England and Scotland in 1707 , Edinburgh was one of the four Scottish castles to be maintained and permanently garrisoned by the new British Army , the others being Stirling , Dumbarton and Blackness . 
 The castle was almost taken in the first Jacobite rising in support of James Stuart , the " Old Pretender " , in 1715 . On 8 September , just two days after the rising began , a party of around 100 Jacobite Highlanders , led by Lord Drummond , attempted to scale the walls with the assistance of members of the garrison . However , the rope ladder lowered by the castle sentries was too short , and the alarm was raised after a change of the watch . The Jacobites fled , while the deserters within the castle were hanged or flogged . In 1728 , General Wade reported that the castle 's defences were decayed and inadequate , and a major strengthening of the defences was carried out throughout the 1720s and 1730s . This was the period when most of the artillery defences and bastions on the north and west sides of the castle were built . These were designed by military engineer Captain John Romer , and built by the architect William Adam . They include the Argyle Battery , Mills Mount Battery , the Low Defences and the Western Defences . 
 The last military action at the castle took place during the second Jacobite rising of 1745 . The Jacobite army , under Charles Edward Stuart ( " Bonnie Prince Charlie " ) , captured Edinburgh without a fight in September 1745 , but the castle remained in the hands of its ageing Deputy Governor , General George Preston , who refused to surrender . After their victory over the government army at Prestonpans on 21 September , the Jacobites attempted to blockade the castle . Preston 's response was to bombard Jacobite positions within the town . After several buildings had been demolished and four people killed , Charles called off the blockade . The Jacobites themselves had no heavy guns with which to respond , and by November they had marched into England , leaving Edinburgh to the castle garrison . 
 Over the next century , the castle vaults were used to hold prisoners of war during several conflicts , including the Seven Years ' War ( 1756 – 1763 ) , the American War of Independence ( 1775 – 1783 ) and the Napoleonic Wars ( 1803 – 1815 ) . During this time , several new buildings were erected within the castle , including powder magazines , stores , the Governor 's House ( 1742 ) , and the New Barracks ( 1796 – 1799 ) . 
 = = = 19th century to the present = = = 
 A mass prison break in 1811 , in which 49 prisoners of war escaped via a hole in the south wall , persuaded the authorities that the castle vaults were no longer suitable as a prison . This use ceased in 1814 and the castle began gradually to assume a different role as a national monument . In 1818 , Sir Walter Scott was given permission to search the castle for the Crown of Scotland , believed lost after the union of Scotland and England in 1707 . Breaking into a sealed room , now known as the Crown Room , and unlocking a chest within , he rediscovered the Honours of Scotland , which were then put on public display with an entry charge of one shilling . In 1822 , King George IV made a visit to Edinburgh , becoming the first reigning monarch to visit the castle since Charles II in 1651 . In 1829 , the cannon Mons Meg was returned from the Tower of London , where it had been taken as part of the process of disarming Scotland after " the ' 45 " , and the palace began to be opened up to visitors during the 1830s . St Margaret 's Chapel was " rediscovered " in 1845 , having been used as a store for many years . Works in the 1880s , funded by the Edinburgh publisher William Nelson and carried out by Hippolyte Blanc , saw the Argyle Tower built over the Portcullis Gate and the Great Hall restored after years of use as a barracks . A new Gatehouse was built in 1888 . During the 19th century , several schemes were put forward for rebuilding the whole castle as a Scottish Baronial style château . Work began in 1858 , but was soon abandoned , and only the hospital building was eventually remodelled in 1897 . Following the death of Prince Albert in 1861 , the architect David Bryce put forward a proposal for a 50 @-@ metre ( 160 ft ) keep as a memorial , but Queen Victoria objected and the scheme was not pursued . 
 In 1905 , responsibility for the castle was transferred from the War Office to the Office of Works , although the garrison remained until 1923 , when the troops moved to Redford Barracks in south @-@ west Edinburgh . The castle was again used as a prison during the First World War , when " Red <unk> " David Kirkwood was confined in the military prison block , and during the Second World War , when downed German Luftwaffe pilots were captured . The position of Governor of Edinburgh Castle , vacant since 1876 , was revived in 1935 as an honorary title for the General Officer Commanding in Scotland , the first holder being Lieutenant @-@ General Sir Archibald Cameron of Lochiel . The castle passed into the care of Historic Scotland when it was established in 1991 , and was designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1993 . The buildings and structures of the castle are further protected by 24 separate listings , including 13 at category A , the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland . The Old and New Towns of Edinburgh , a World Heritage Site inscribed by UNESCO in 1995 , is described as " dominated by a medieval fortress " . 
 = = Description = = 
 Edinburgh Castle is located at the top of the Royal Mile , at the west end of Edinburgh 's Old Town . The volcanic Castle Rock offers a naturally defended position , with sheer cliffs to north and south , and a steep ascent from the west . The only easy approach is from the town to the east , and the castle 's defences are situated accordingly , with a series of gates protecting the route to the summit of the Castle Rock . 
 = = = Outer defences = = = 
 In front of the castle is a long sloping forecourt known as the Esplanade . Originally the Spur , a 16th @-@ century hornwork , was located here . The present Esplanade was laid out as a parade ground in 1753 , and extended in 1845 . It is upon this Esplanade that the Edinburgh Military Tattoo takes place annually . From the Esplanade the Half Moon Battery is prominent , with the Royal Palace to its left . 
 The Gatehouse at the head of the Esplanade was built as an architecturally cosmetic addition to the castle in 1888 . Statues of Robert the Bruce by Thomas Clapperton and William Wallace by Alexander Carrick were added in 1929 , and the Latin motto Nemo me impune lacessit is inscribed above the gate . The dry ditch in front of the entrance was completed in its present form in 1742 . Within the Gatehouse are offices , and to the north is the most recent addition to the castle ; the ticket office , completed in 2008 to a design by Gareth Hoskins Architects . The road , built by James III in 1464 for the transport of cannon , leads upward and around to the north of the Half Moon Battery and the Forewall Battery , to the Portcullis Gate . In 1990 , an alternative access was opened by digging a tunnel from the north of the esplanade to the north @-@ west part of the castle , separating visitor traffic from service traffic . 
 = = = Portcullis Gate and Argyle Tower = = = 
 The Portcullis Gate was begun by the Regent Morton after the Lang Siege of 1571 – 73 to replace the round Constable 's Tower , which was destroyed in the siege . In 1584 the upper parts of the Gatehouse were completed by William Schaw , and these were further modified in 1750 . In 1886 – 1887 this plain building was replaced with a Scots Baronial tower , designed by the architect Hippolyte Blanc , although the original Portcullis Gate remains below . The new structure was named the Argyle Tower , from the fact that the 9th Earl of Argyll had been held here prior to his execution in 1685 . Described as " restoration in an extreme form " , the rebuilding of the Argyle Tower was the first in a series of works funded by the publisher William Nelson . 
 Just inside the gate is the Argyle Battery overlooking Princes Street , with Mills Mount Battery , the location of the One O 'Clock Gun , to the west . Below these is the Low Defence , while at the base of the rock is the ruined <unk> Tower , built in 1362 to guard St. Margaret 's Well . This natural spring provided an important secondary source of water for the castle , the water being lifted up by a crane mounted on a platform known as the Crane Bastion . 
 = = = Military buildings = = = 
 The areas to the north and west of the Argyle Tower are largely occupied by military buildings erected after the castle became a major garrison in the early 18th century . Adjacent to Mills Mount are the 18th @-@ century cart sheds , now tea rooms . The Governor 's House to the south was built in 1742 as accommodation for the Governor , Storekeeper , and Master Gunner , and was used until the post of Governor became vacant in the later 19th century ; it was then used by nurses of the castle hospital . Today , it functions as an officers ' mess , and as the office of the Governor since the restoration of the post in 1936 . 
 South of the Governor 's House are the New Barracks , completed in 1799 to house 600 soldiers , and replacing the outdated accommodation in the Great Hall . They now house the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Regimental Headquarters and Museum of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards ( Carabiniers and Greys ) . The latter was opened in 1995 by the regiment 's Colonel , Queen Elizabeth II . Also nearby , in the former Royal Scots drill hall , constructed in 1900 , is the regimental museum of the Royal Scots ( The Royal Regiment ) . The military prison was built in 1842 as a detention block for the castle garrison and was extended in the 1880s . It was last used in 1923 , when the garrison moved to the city 's Redford Barracks . 
 = = = = National War Museum of Scotland = = = = 
 West of the Governor 's House , a store for munitions was built in 1747 – 48 and later extended to form a courtyard , in which the main gunpowder magazine also stood . In 1897 the area was remodelled as a military hospital , formerly housed in the Great Hall . The building to the south of this courtyard is now the National War Museum of Scotland , which forms part of the National Museums of Scotland . It was formerly known as the Scottish United Services Museum , and , prior to this , the Scottish Naval and Military Museum , when it was located in the Queen Anne Building . It covers Scotland 's military history over the past 400 years , and includes a wide range of military artefacts , such as uniforms , medals and weapons . The exhibits also illustrate the history and causes behind the many wars in which Scottish soldiers have been involved . Beside the museum is Butts Battery , named after the archery butts ( targets ) formerly placed here . Below it are the Western Defences , where a postern , named the West Sally Port , gives access to the western slope of the rock . 
 = = = Upper Ward = = = 
 The Upper Ward or Citadel occupies the highest part of the Castle Rock , and is entered via the late 17th @-@ century <unk> 's Gate . The origin of this name is unknown , although it was formerly known as the Foggy Gate , which may relate to the dense sea @-@ fogs , known as <unk> , which commonly affect Edinburgh . Adjacent to the gates are the large cisterns built to reduce the castle 's dependency on well water and a former fire station , now used as a shop . The summit of the rock is occupied by St Margaret 's Chapel and 15th @-@ century siege gun Mons Meg . On a ledge below this area is a small 19th @-@ century Dogs ' Cemetery for the burial of the soldiers ' regimental mascots . Beside this , the Lang Stair leads down to the Argyle Battery , past a section of a medieval bastion , and gives access to the upper storey of the Argyle Tower . The eastern end of the Upper Ward is occupied by the Forewall and Half Moon Batteries , with Crown Square to the south . 
 = = = = St. Margaret 's Chapel = = = = 
 The oldest building in the castle , and in Edinburgh , is the small St. Margaret 's Chapel . One of the few 12th @-@ century structures surviving in any Scottish castle , it dates from the reign of King David I ( r.1124 – 1153 ) , who built it as a private chapel for the royal family and dedicated it to his mother , Saint Margaret of Scotland , who died in the castle in 1093 . It survived the slighting of 1314 , when the castle 's defences were destroyed on the orders of Robert the Bruce , and was used as a gunpowder store from the 16th century , when the present roof was built . In 1845 , it was " discovered " by the antiquary Daniel Wilson , while in use as part of the larger garrison chapel , and was restored in 1851 – 1852 . The chapel is still used for religious ceremonies , such as weddings . 
 = = = = Mons Meg = = = = 
 The 15th @-@ century siege gun or bombard known as Mons Meg is displayed on a terrace in front of St. Margaret 's Chapel . She was constructed in Flanders on the orders of Philip III , Duke of Burgundy in 1449 , and given as a gift to King James II , the husband of his niece , in 1457 . The 13 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 9 t ) gun rests on a reconstructed carriage , the details of which were copied from an old stone relief that can be seen inside the tunnel of the Gatehouse at the castle entrance . Some of Meg 's large gun stones , weighing around 330 pounds ( 150 kg ) each , are displayed alongside her . On 3 July 1558 , she was fired in salute to celebrate the marriage of Mary , Queen of Scots to the French dauphin , François II . The royal Treasurer 's Accounts of the time record a payment to soldiers for retrieving one of her stones from <unk> Muir near the River Forth , fully 2 miles ( 3 km ) from the castle . The gun has been defunct since her barrel burst while firing a salute to greet the Duke of Albany , the future King James VII and II , on his arrival in Edinburgh on 30 October 1681 . 
 = = = = Half Moon Battery and David 's Tower = = = = 
 The Half Moon Battery , which remains a prominent feature on the east side of the castle , was built as part of the reconstruction works supervised by the Regent Morton , and was erected between 1573 and 1588 . The Forewall to the north was built between 1689 and 1695 to link the Half Moon to the Portcullis Tower , although part of the original wall of 1540 was incorporated into it . The Half Moon Battery was built around and over the ruins of David 's Tower , two storeys of which survive beneath , with windows facing out onto the interior wall of the battery . David 's Tower was built on an L @-@ plan , the main block being 51 by 38 feet ( 16 by 12 m ) , with a wing measuring 21 by 18 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 by 5 @.@ 5 m ) to the west . The entrance was via a pointed @-@ arched doorway in the inner angle , although in the 16th century this was filled in to make the tower a solid rectangle . Prior to the Lang Siege , the tower was recorded as being 59 feet ( 18 m ) high , and the remaining portions stand up to 49 feet ( 15 m ) from the rock . 
 The tower was rediscovered during routine maintenance work in 1912 , and excavations below the Half Moon Battery revealed the extent of the surviving buildings . Several rooms are accessible to the public , although the lower parts are generally closed . Outside the tower , but within the battery , is a three @-@ storey room , where large portions of the exterior wall of the tower are still visible , showing shattered masonry caused by the bombardment of 1573 . Beside the tower , a section of the former curtain wall was discovered , with a gun loop which overlooked the High Street : a recess was made in the outer battery wall to reveal this gun loop . Also in 1912 – 1913 , the adjacent Fore Well was cleared and surveyed , and was found to be 110 feet ( 34 m ) deep , and mostly hewn through the rock below the castle . 
 = = = Crown Square = = = 
 Crown Square , also known as Palace Yard , was laid out in the 15th century , during the reign of King James III , as the principal courtyard of the castle . The foundations were formed by the construction of a series of large stone vaults built onto the uneven Castle Rock in the 1430s . These vaults were used as a state prison until the 19th century , although more important prisoners were held in the main parts of the castle . The square is formed by the Royal Palace to the east , the Great Hall to the south , the Queen Anne Building to the west , and the National War Memorial to the north . 
 = = = = Royal Palace = = = = 
 The Royal Palace comprises the former royal apartments , which were the residence of the later Stewart monarchs . It was begun in the mid 15th century , during the reign of James IV , and it originally communicated with David 's Tower . The building was extensively remodelled for the visit of James VI to the castle in 1617 , when state apartments for the King and Queen were built . On the ground floor is the Laich ( low ) Hall , now called the King 's Dining Room , and a small room , known as the Birth Chamber or Mary Room , where James VI was born to Mary , Queen of Scots , in June 1566 . The commemorative painted ceiling and other decoration were added in 1617 . On the first floor is the vaulted Crown Room , built in 1615 to house the Honours of Scotland : the crown , the sceptre and the sword of state . The Stone of Scone , upon which the monarchs of Scotland were traditionally crowned , has been kept in the Crown Room since its return to Scotland in 1996 . To the south of the palace is the Register House , built in the 1540s to accommodate state archives . 
 = = = = Great Hall = = = = 
 The Great Hall measures 29 by 12 @.@ 5 metres ( 95 by 41 ft ) , and was the chief place of state assembly in the castle , although there is no evidence that the Parliament of Scotland ever met here , as is sometimes reported . Historians have disagreed over its dating , although it is usually ascribed to the reign of King James IV , and is thought to have been completed in the early years of the 16th century . The decorative carved stone corbels supporting the roof have Renaissance detailing , which has been compared to works at Blois , France , of around 1515 , indicating that the arts in Scotland were relatively advanced at this time . It is one of only two medieval halls in Scotland with an original hammerbeam roof . 
 Following Oliver Cromwell 's seizure of the castle in 1650 , the Great Hall was converted into a barracks for his troops ; and in 1737 it was subdivided into three storeys to house 312 soldiers . Following the construction of the New Barracks in the 1790s , it became a military hospital until 1897 . It was then restored by Hippolyte Blanc in line with contemporary ideas of medieval architecture . The Great Hall is still occasionally used for ceremonial occasions , and has been used as a venue on Hogmanay for BBC Scotland 's Hogmanay Live programme . To the south of the hall is a section of curtain wall from the 14th century with a parapet of later date . 
 = = = = Queen Anne Building = = = = 
 In the 16th century , this area housed the kitchens serving the adjacent Great Hall , and was later the site of the Royal <unk> . The present building was named after Queen Anne and was built during the attempted Jacobite invasion by the Old Pretender in 1708 . It was designed by Captain Theodore Dury , military engineer for Scotland , who also designed Dury 's Battery , named in his honour , on the south side of the castle in 1713 . The Queen Anne Building provided accommodation for Staff Officers , but after the departure of the Army it was remodelled in the 1920s as the Naval and Military Museum , to complement the newly opened Scottish National War Memorial . The museum later moved to the former hospital in the western part of the castle , and the building now houses a function suite and an education centre . 
 = = = = Scottish National War Memorial = = = = 
 The Scottish National War Memorial occupies a converted barrack block on the north side of Crown Square . It stands on the site of the medieval St. Mary 's Church which was rebuilt in 1366 , and was converted into an armoury in 1540 . It was demolished in 1755 , and the masonry reused to build a new North Barrack Block on the site . Proposals for a Scottish National War Memorial were put forward in 1917 , during the First World War , and the architect Sir Robert Lorimer was appointed in 1919 . Construction began in 1923 , and the memorial was formally opened on 14 July 1927 by the Prince of Wales . The exterior is decorated with gargoyles and sculpture , while the interior contains monuments to individual regiments . The stained @-@ glass windows are by Douglas Strachan . 
 The memorial commemorates Scottish soldiers , and those serving with Scottish regiments , who died in the two world wars and in more recent conflicts . Upon the altar within the Shrine , placed upon the highest point of the Castle Rock , is a sealed casket containing Rolls of Honour which list over 147 @,@ 000 names of those soldiers killed in the First World War . After the Second World War , another 50 @,@ 000 names were inscribed on Rolls of Honour held within the Hall , and further names continue to be added there . The memorial is maintained by a charitable trust .

 Edinburgh Castle is in the ownership of the Scottish Ministers as heads of the devolved Scottish Government . The castle is run and administered , for the most part , by Historic Scotland , an executive agency of the Scottish Government , although the Army remains responsible for some areas , including the New Barracks block and the military museums . Both Historic Scotland and the Army share use of the <unk> immediately inside the castle entrance . 
 = = = Tourist attraction = = = 
 Historic Scotland undertakes the dual tasks of operating the castle as a commercially viable tourist attraction , while simultaneously bearing responsibility for conservation of the site . Edinburgh Castle remains the most popular paid visitor attraction in Scotland , with over 1 @.@ 4 million visitors in 2013 . Historic Scotland maintains a number of facilities within the castle , including two cafés / restaurants , several shops , and numerous historical displays . An educational centre in the Queen Anne Building runs events for schools and educational groups , and employs re @-@ enactors in costume and with period weaponry . 
 = = = Military role = = = 
 Direct administration of the castle by the War Office came to an end in 1905 , and in 1923 the Army formally moved to the city 's new Redford Barracks . Nevertheless , the castle continues to have a strong connection with the Army , and is one of the few ancient castles in Britain that still has a military garrison , albeit for largely ceremonial and administrative purposes . Public duties performed by the garrison include guarding the Honours of Scotland , and armed sentries stand watch at the Gatehouse outside opening hours . The post of Governor of Edinburgh Castle is now a ceremonial post , held by the General Officer Commanding Scotland . The New Barracks contain both the Governor 's House , which serves as the Officers ' Mess , and the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Scotland . The Army retains responsibility for these and for the Royal Scots Museum and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Museum . 
 = = = Military tattoo = = = 
 A series of performances known as the Edinburgh Military Tattoo ( since 2010 the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo ) takes place on the Esplanade each year during August . The basis of each performance is a parade of the massed pipes and drums of the Scottish regiments , and since its inception in 1950 the tattoo has developed a complex format which includes a variety of performers invited from around the world , although still with a largely military focus . The climax of the evening is the lone piper on the castle battlements , playing a pibroch in memory of dead comrades @-@ in @-@ arms , followed by massed bands joining in a medley of traditional Scottish tunes . The tattoo attracts an annual audience of around 217 @,@ 000 people , and is broadcast in some 30 countries to a television audience estimated at 100 million . 
 = = = One O 'Clock Gun = = = 
 The One O 'Clock Gun is a time signal , fired every day at precisely 13 : 00 , excepting Sunday , Good Friday and Christmas Day . The ' Time Gun ' was established in 1861 as a time signal for ships in the harbour of Leith and the Firth of Forth , 2 miles ( 3 km ) away . It complemented the ' Time Ball ' , which was installed on the Nelson Monument in 1852 , but was useless as a visual signal in foggy weather . Because sound travels relatively slowly ( approximately 343 metres per second ( 770 mph ) ) , a map was produced in 1861 to show the actual time when the sound of the gun would be heard at various locations across Edinburgh . 
 The original gun was an 18 @-@ pound muzzle @-@ loading cannon , which needed four men to load , and was fired from the Half Moon Battery . This was replaced in 1913 by a 32 @-@ pound breech @-@ loader , and in May 1952 by a 25 @-@ pound Howitzer . The present One O 'Clock Gun is an <unk> Light Gun , brought into service on 30 November 2001 . On Sunday 2 April 1916 , the One O 'Clock Gun was fired in vain at a German Zeppelin during an air raid , the gun 's only known use in war . 
 The gun is now fired from Mill 's Mount Battery , on the north face of the castle , by the District Gunner from the 105th Regiment Royal Artillery ( Volunteers ) . Although the gun is no longer required for its original purpose , the ceremony has become a popular tourist attraction . The longest @-@ serving District Gunner , Staff Sergeant Thomas McKay MBE , nicknamed " Tam the Gun " , fired the One O 'Clock Gun from 1979 until his retirement in January 2005 . McKay helped establish the One O 'Clock Gun Association , which opened a small exhibition at Mill 's Mount , and published a book entitled What Time Does Edinburgh 's One O 'clock Gun Fire ? . In 2006 Sergeant Jamie Shannon , nicknamed " Shannon the Cannon " , became the 29th District Gunner , and in 2006 Bombardier Allison Jones became the first woman to fire the gun . 
 = = = Symbol of Edinburgh = = = 
 The castle has become a recognisable symbol of Edinburgh , and of Scotland . It appears , in stylised form , on the coats of arms of the City of Edinburgh and the University of Edinburgh . It also features on the badge of No. 603 ( City of Edinburgh ) Squadron which was based at RAF Turnhouse ( now Edinburgh Airport ) during Second World War . Images of the castle are used as a logo by organisations including Edinburgh Rugby , the Edinburgh Evening News , Hibernian F.C. and the Edinburgh Marathon . It also appears on the " Castle series " of Royal Mail postage stamps , and has been represented on various issues of banknotes issued by Scottish clearing banks . In the 1960s the castle was illustrated on £ 5 notes issued by the National Commercial Bank of Scotland , and since 1987 it has featured on the reverse of £ 1 notes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland . Since 2009 the castle , as part of Edinburgh 's World Heritage Site , has appeared on £ 10 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank . The castle is a focal point for annual fireworks displays which mark Edinburgh 's Hogmanay ( new year ) celebrations , and the end of the Edinburgh Festival in the summer .

 = Helmichis = 
 Helmichis ( fl . 572 ) was a Lombard noble who killed his king , Alboin , in 572 and unsuccessfully attempted to usurp his throne . Alboin 's queen , Rosamund , supported or at least did not oppose Helmichis ' plan to remove the king , and after the assassination Helmichis married her . The assassination was assisted by Peredeo , the king 's chamber @-@ guard , who in some sources becomes the material <unk> of the murder . Helmichis is first mentioned by the contemporary chronicler Marius of Avenches , but the most detailed account of his endeavours derives from Paul the Deacon 's late 8th @-@ century Historia Langobardorum . 
 The background to the assassination begins when Alboin killed the king of the Gepids in 567 and captured the king 's daughter Rosamund . Alboin then led his people into Italy , and by 572 had settled himself in Verona , which made him vulnerable to the ambitions of other prominent Lombards , such as Helmichis , who was Alboin 's foster @-@ brother and arms @-@ bearer . After Alboin 's death , Helmichis attempted to gain the throne . He married Rosamund to legitimize his position as new king , but immediately faced stiff opposition from his fellow Lombards who suspected Helmichis of conniving with the Byzantines ; this hostility eventually focused around the duke of Ticinum Cleph , supporter of an aggressive policy towards the Empire . Rather than going to war , Helmichis , Rosamund and their followers escaped to Ravenna , the capital of Byzantine Italy , where they were received with full honours by the authorities . Once in Ravenna , Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis in order to be free to marry him . Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis , but the latter , having understood what his wife had done to him , forced her to drink the cup too , so both of them died . After their deaths , Longinus dispatched Helmichis ' forces to Constantinople , while the remaining Lombards had already found a new king in Cleph . 
 = = Background = = 
 The oldest author to write about Helmichis is the contemporary chronicler Marius of Avenches . In his account he mentions that " Alboin was killed by his followers , that is <unk> with the rest , his wife agreeing to it " . Marius continues by adding that , after killing the king , Helmichis married his widow and tried unsuccessfully to gain the throne . His attempt failed and he was forced to escape together with his wife , the royal treasure and the troops that had sided with him in the coup . This account has strong similarities with what is told in the Origo . The Origo would in its turn become a direct source for the Historia Langobardorum . 
 The background to the assassination begins when Alboin , king of the Lombards , a Germanic people living in Pannonia ( in the region of modern Hungary ) , went to war against the neighbouring Gepids in 567 . In a decisive battle , Alboin killed the Gepid king Cunimund and captured the king 's daughter Rosamund – later marrying her to guarantee the loyalty of the surviving Gepids . The following year , the Lombards migrated to Italy , a territory then held by the Byzantine Empire . In 569 Alboin took Mediolanum ( Milan ) , the capital of northern Italy , and by 570 he had assumed control of most of northern Italy . The Byzantine forces entrenched themselves in the strategic town of Ticinum ( Pavia ) , which they took only after a long siege . Even before taking Ticinum , the Lombards crossed the Apennines and invaded <unk> . After the fall of Ticinum , Alboin chose Verona as his first permanent headquarters . In this town Alboin was assassinated in 572 and it is in these circumstances that Helmichis ' name is first heard of . Most of the available details are in the Historia Langobardorum . 
 = = Assassination = = 
 By settling himself in Verona and temporarily interrupting his chain of conquests , Alboin had weakened his popular standing as a charismatic warrior king . The first to take advantage of this was Rosamund , who could count on the support of the Gepid warriors in the town in her search for an opportunity to avenge the death of her father . To obtain this goal she persuaded Helmichis , <unk> ( arms bearer ) and foster brother of the king , and also head of a personal armed retinue in Verona , to take part in a plot to eliminate Alboin and replace him on the throne . Helmichis persuaded Rosamund to involve Peredeo , described by Paul simply as " a very strong man " , who was seduced through a trick by the Queen and forced to consent to become the actual assassin . 
 This story is partly in conflict with what is told by the Origo , which has Peredeo acting as an instigator and not as the murderer . In a similar vein to the Origo is the account of Peredeo contained in the Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani , where it is added that Peredeo was Alboin 's " chamber @-@ guard " , hinting that in the original version of the story Peredeo 's role may just have been to let in the real assassin , who is Helmichis in Agnellus ' account , as it had been in that of Marius . However , the primary intent of the Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani may have been to obtain a more straightforward and coherent narrative by reducing the number of actors in the story , beginning with Peredeo . The disappearance of Peredeo , however , means that the role of Helmichis changes : while Paul presents him as " the efficient conspirator and killer " , with Agnellus he is a victim of a ruthless and domineering queen . 
 According to historian Paolo <unk> it may be that Agnellus ' narrative better reflects Lombard oral tradition than Paul 's . In his interpretation , Paul 's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition . In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition , it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen , and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin 's royal charisma magically to the king 's prospective murderer . A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul 's account of the assassin 's entry : Alboin 's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power . 
 After the king 's death on June 28 , 572 , Helmichis married Rosamund and claimed the Lombard throne in Verona . The marriage was important for Helmichis : it legitimized his rule because , judging from Lombard history , royal prerogatives could be inherited by marrying the king 's widow ; and the marriage was a guarantee for Helmichis of the loyalty of the Gepids in the army , who sided with the queen since she was Cunimund 's daughter . 
 = = Failure = = 
 Behind the coup were almost certainly the Byzantines , who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody , if not from a pro @-@ Byzantine faction , at least less actively aggressive . Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis ' motivation for his coup : his reason could have involved a family link to the <unk> , the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin 's father Audoin ; or he may have been related through Amalafrid to the Amali , the leading dynasty of the Goths . Helmichis easily obtained the support of the Lombards in Verona , and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin 's only child , Albsuinda , under his control . He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes ' loyalty economically . 
 Helmichis ' coup ultimately failed because it met strong opposition from the many Lombards who wanted to continue the war against the Byzantines and to confront the regicides . Faced with the prospect of going to war at overwhelming odds , Helmichis asked for help from the Byzantines . The praetorian prefect Longinus enabled him to avoid a land route possibly held by hostile forces , by shipping him instead down the Po to Byzantine @-@ held Ravenna , together with his wife , his Lombard and Gepid troops , the royal treasure and Albsuinda . Bognetti believes that Longinus may have planned to make the Lombards weaker by depriving them of any legitimate heir . In addition , because of the ongoing war , it was hard to assemble all the warriors to elect a new king formally . This plan was brought to nothing by the troops stationed in Ticinum , who elected their duke Cleph king , having it in mind to continue Alboin 's aggressive policy . In contrast , Wolfram argues that Cleph was elected in Ticinum while Helmichis was still making his bid for the crown in Verona .
