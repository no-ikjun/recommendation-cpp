 The original airport serving Bangalore was HAL Airport , located 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) from the city centre . However , as Bangalore grew into the Silicon Valley of India and passenger traffic to the city rose , the airport was unable to cope . There was no room for expansion and the apron could only park six aircraft . In March 1991 , former chairman of the National Airports Authority of India ( <unk> ) S. Ramanathan convened a panel to select the site for a new airport . The panel decided on Devanahalli , a village about 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) north of Bangalore . The State Government made a proposal to build the airport with private assistance , which the Union Government approved in 1994 . 
 In December 1995 , a consortium consisting of Tata Group , Raytheon and Singapore Changi Airport signed a memorandum of understanding with the State Government regarding participation in the project . In June 1998 , however , the consortium announced it was pulling out of the project due to delays in government approval . These included disputes over the location of the airport and the fate of HAL Airport . 
 In May 1999 , the Airports Authority of India ( AAI ) and the Karnataka State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation ( <unk> ) of the State Government signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the nature of the project . It would be a public – private partnership , with AAI and <unk> having a 26 % share and private companies having the remaining 74 % . In January 2001 , the State Government created the company Bangalore International Airport Limited ( BIAL ) as a special purpose entity and began searching for partners . By November , the project had attracted Unique Zürich Airport , Siemens Project Ventures and Larsen & Toubro . Construction was expected to begin in October 2002 ; however , governmental delays persisted . The concession agreement between the State Government , the Union Government and BIAL was signed in July 2004 . In it , BIAL required the closure of HAL Airport . 
 = = = Construction and opening ( 2005 – 08 ) = = = 
 Construction finally commenced on 2 July 2005 . When a study predicted the airport would receive 6 @.@ 7 million passengers in 2008 , the airport was redesigned from its initial capacity of 4 @.@ 5 million passengers to 11 million , with the terminal size expanded and the number of aircraft stands increased . The cost of the airport rose to ₹ 1 @,@ 930 crore ( US $ 290 million ) . Construction was completed in 32 months , and BIAL set the launch date for 30 March 2008 . However , due to delays in establishing air traffic control services at the airport , the launch date was pushed to 11 May and finally 24 May 2008 . 
 As the opening date for the airport approached , public criticism arose , mainly directed toward the closure of HAL Airport . In March 2008 , AAI employees conducted a massive strike against the closure of HAL Airport along with Begumpet Airport in Hyderabad , fearing they would lose their jobs . The Bangalore City Connect Foundation , a group of citizens and businessmen , staged a rally in mid @-@ May , claiming the new airport was too small for the latest demand projections . On 23 May , a hearing was held at the Karnataka High Court over poor connectivity between the city and the airport . Ultimately , the State Government decided to go ahead with inaugurating the new airport and closing HAL Airport . 
 The first flight to the airport , Air India Flight 609 from Mumbai , was allowed to land the previous night as it would be continuing to Singapore shortly after midnight . The aircraft touched down at 10 : 40 pm on 23 May . The airport became the third greenfield airport under a public – private partnership to open in India , after Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad and Cochin International Airport . 
 = = = Renaming and expansion ( 2009 – present ) = = = 
 The original name of the airport was Bengaluru International Airport . In February 2009 , the State Government sent a proposal to the Union Government to rename the airport after the founder of Bangalore , Kempe Gowda I. When no action was taken , the State Government passed a resolution for the name change in December 2011 . The Union Government accepted the proposal in 2012 and formally approved it in July 2013 . The airport was officially renamed on 14 December 2013 amid the inauguration of the expanded terminal building . 
 Kingfisher Airlines once operated a hub and was one of the largest airlines at Kempegowda Airport . Following its collapse in October 2012 , other airlines stepped in to fill the gap in domestic connectivity by adding more flights . In addition , Air Pegasus and AirAsia India launched hub operations at the airport in 2014 . 
 The first phase of expansion was launched in June 2011 and finished in December 2013 . The ₹ 1 @,@ 500 crore ( US $ 220 million ) project doubled the size of the passenger terminal to 150 @,@ 556 square metres ( 1 @,@ 620 @,@ 570 sq ft ) , involving the construction of additional facilities for check @-@ in , immigration , security and baggage reclaim constructed . One domestic gate and three international gates were added as well . A large , sweeping roof connects the original building with the expanded areas . The expanded terminal , dubbed " Terminal 1A " , has raised the annual passenger capacity of the airport to 20 million . 
 = = Ownership = = 
 The airport is owned and operated by Bangalore International Airport Limited ( BIAL ) , a public limited company . The Government of India has granted BIAL the right to operate the airport for 30 years , with the option to continue for another 30 years . The company is a public – private venture . 26 % is held by government entities Karnataka State Industrial Investment and Development Corporation ( 13 % ) and Airports Authority of India ( 13 % ) , and 74 % is held by private companies Fairfax Financial ( 38 % ) , Siemens Project Ventures ( 26 % ) and <unk> Group ( 10 % ) .

 Kempegowda Airport has one runway : 
 Runway 09 / 27 : 4 @,@ 000 by 45 metres ( 13 @,@ 123 ft × 148 ft ) , CAT I , ILS equipped . 
 Four years after it was laid , the runway was entirely resurfaced because of a serious decline in quality . From 11 March to 3 April 2012 , it was closed daily between 10 : 30 am and 5 : 30 pm . As a result , BIAL accused construction company Larsen & Toubro of building the runway poorly . South of runway 09 / 27 are a full @-@ length parallel taxiway and the apron , which extends from the Blue Dart / DHL terminal to the passenger terminal . 
 = = Terminal = = 
 The passenger terminal accommodates both domestic and international operations . It covers 150 @,@ 556 square metres ( 1 @,@ 620 @,@ 570 sq ft ) and can handle 20 million passengers annually . Check @-@ in and baggage reclaim are situated on the lower floor , while all departure gates are located on the upper floor . There is a total of twelve gates : six domestic gates ( gates 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 15 ) and six international gates ( 16 , 17 , 18 , 21 @-@ 22 , 23 @-@ 24 , 25 @-@ 26 ) . Gate 25 @-@ 26 is equipped to serve the world 's largest passenger aircraft , the Airbus A380 . Lounges are provided by Above Ground Level and Plaza Premium Lounge , which also operates a day hotel in the terminal .

 The airport has a fuel farm , spread over 11 acres ( 4 @.@ 5 ha ) west of the cargo village and passenger terminal . It was built by <unk> <unk> Ltd ( <unk> ) but is shared by multiple oil companies . In October 2008 , Indian Oil commissioned a 36 @-@ kilometre ( 22 mi ) fuel pipeline between its storage terminal in <unk> and Kempegowda Airport . Previously , jet fuel had to be transported to the airport by tank trucks , which created traffic and pollution problems .

 Kempegowda Airport has three cargo terminals . One is operated by Menzies Aviation <unk> Pvt Ltd and has a capacity for 150 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 170 @,@ 000 short tons ) of cargo ; it includes a facility for storing pharmaceuticals . Air India <unk> ( AISATS ) operates one terminal , which can handle 200 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 220 @,@ 000 short tons ) of cargo . AISATS is also constructing the AISATS <unk> , which will be able to hold 40 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 44 @,@ 000 short tons ) of perishable goods . Lastly , DHL and Blue Dart Aviation jointly operate a 20 @,@ 500 @-@ square @-@ metre ( 221 @,@ 000 sq ft ) terminal . 
 BIAL inaugurated a separate cargo village in December 2008 . The village is spread over 11 acres ( 4 @.@ 5 ha ) and includes office space , conference rooms , a cafeteria for staff and parking space for nearly 80 trucks . It did not open for occupation until 2010 and initially suffered low occupancy , which some cargo agents attributed to the opening delay , high rent and limited infrastructure .

 Kempegowda Airport is connected to the city of Bangalore by National Highway 7 ( NH 7 ) . In January 2014 , a six @-@ lane flyover was completed over NH 7 between Hebbal and the airport , helping to reduce travel time to and from the city . The airport car park is located at ground level and can hold 2 @,@ 000 vehicles . The airport is served by several taxi and rental car companies . In addition , ride @-@ sharing companies Ola and Uber have their own pick @-@ up zones outside the terminal . 
 The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation ( <unk> ) provides bus transportation to major parts of the city through the Vayu Vajra ( Kannada for " Diamond in the Air " ) service . It is operated using a fleet of Volvo B7RLE buses . In addition , the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation ( KSRTC ) operates a nonstop bus service between Kempegowda Airport and Mysore , as well as a route to Manipal via Mangalore .

 Under Phase 3 of the <unk> Metro , a rail link will be constructed between the city and Kempegowda Airport , which will receive an underground station . <unk> has conducted a feasibility study and selected five possible routes ; however , the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation ( <unk> ) has yet to choose one . A high @-@ speed rail link was previously considered and went as far as obtaining approval from the Union Government . However , the project was eventually scrapped due to high costs and the lack of stops along the line .

 The second phase of expansion is underway , which encompasses the construction of a second runway and passenger terminal . When complete , Kempegowda Airport will be able to handle 55 million passengers per year . The estimated ₹ 4 @,@ 000 crore ( US $ 590 million ) project received clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests in September 2014 . 
 Ground work on the second runway began in February 2016 and will continue for another 12 months , after which the runway will be laid . Located south of the original terminal , it will be parallel to runway 09 / 27 and measure 4 @,@ 000 by 60 metres ( 13 @,@ 120 ft × 200 ft ) , wider than the original runway so it can accommodate larger aircraft . The new runway will also be CAT III certified , allowing for landings in fog and other low visibility conditions . The design of Terminal 2 will be finalised in August 2016 , which is being prepared by US architectural firm Skidmore , Owings & Merrill . Construction of the terminal is expected to begin in January 2017 , with the first stage allowing for a capacity of 20 million annual passengers and the second stage raising it to 35 million . 
 = Trafalgar Square = 
 Trafalgar Square ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ FAL @-@ <unk> ) is a public square in the City of Westminster , Central London , built around the area formerly known as Charing Cross . Its name commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar , a British naval victory in the Napoleonic Wars with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of Cape Trafalgar , Spain . 
 The site of Trafalgar Square had been a significant landmark since the 13th century and originally contained the King 's Mews . After George IV moved the mews to Buckingham Palace , the area was redeveloped by John Nash but progress was slow after his death and the square did not open until 1844 . Nelson 's Column at its centre is guarded by four lion statues . A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square but the Fourth Plinth , left empty since 1840 , has been host to contemporary art since 1999 . 
 The square has been used for community gatherings and political demonstrations including Bloody Sunday , the first Aldermaston March , anti @-@ war protests and campaigns against climate change . A Christmas tree has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day . The square is a centre of annual celebrations on New Year 's Eve . It was well known for its feral pigeons until their removal in the early @-@ 21st century . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Trafalgar Square is owned by the Queen in Right of the Crown and managed by the Greater London Authority , while Westminster City Council owns the roads around the square , including the pedestrianised area of the North Terrace . The square contains a large central area with roadways on three sides and a terrace to the north , in front of the National Gallery . The roads around the square form part of the A4 , a major road running west of the City of London . The square was formerly surrounded by a one @-@ way traffic system , but works completed in 2003 reduced the width of the roads and closed the northern side to traffic . 
 Nelson 's Column is in the centre of the square flanked by fountains designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens between 1937 and 1939 as replacements for two fountains of Peterhead granite ( now in Canada ) and guarded by four monumental bronze lions sculpted by Sir Edwin Landseer . At the top of the column is a statue of Horatio Nelson who commanded the British Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar . 
 Surrounding the square are the National Gallery on the north side and St Martin @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Fields Church to the east . To the south west is The Mall leading towards Buckingham Palace via Admiralty Arch , while Whitehall is to the south and the Strand to the east . Charing Cross Road passes between the National Gallery and the church . 
 London Underground 's Charing Cross tube station on the Northern and Bakerloo lines has an exit in the square . The lines had separate stations , of which the Bakerloo line one was called Trafalgar Square until they were linked and renamed in 1979 as part of the construction of the Jubilee line , which was rerouted to Westminster tube station in 1999 . Other nearby tube stations are Embankment connecting the District , Circle , Northern and Bakerloo lines , and Leicester Square on the Northern and Piccadilly lines . 
 London bus routes 3 , 6 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 23 , 24 , 29 , 53 , 87 , 88 , 91 , 139 , 159 , 176 , 453 pass through Trafalgar Square . 
 = = History = = 
 Building work on the south side of the square in 1960 revealed deposits from the last interglacial . Among the findings , dating from approximately 40 @,@ 000 years ago , were the remains of cave lion , rhinoceros , straight @-@ tusked elephant and hippopotamus . 
 The site of Trafalgar Square has been a significant location since the 13th century . During Edward I 's reign , the area was the site of the King 's Mews , running north from the original Charing Cross , where the Strand from the City met Whitehall coming north from Westminster . From the reign of Richard II to that of Henry VII , the mews was at the western end of the Strand . The name " Royal Mews " comes from the practice of keeping hawks here for moulting ; " mew " is an old word for this . After a fire in 1534 , the mews were rebuilt as stables , and remained here until George IV moved them to Buckingham Palace . 
 = = Clearance and development = = 
 After 1732 , the King 's Mews were divided into the Great Mews and the smaller Green Mews to the north by the Crown Stables , a large block , built to the designs of William Kent . Its site is occupied by the National Gallery . In 1826 the Commissioners of H.M. Woods , Forests and Land Revenues instructed John Nash to draw up plans for clearing a large area south of Kent 's stable block , and as far east as St Martin 's Lane . His plans left open the whole area of what became Trafalgar Square , except for a block in the centre , which he reserved for a new building for the Royal Academy . The plans included the demolition and redevelopment of buildings between St Martin 's Lane and the Strand and the construction of a road ( now called Duncannon Street ) across the churchyard of St Martin @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Fields . The Charing Cross Act was passed in 1826 and clearance started soon after . Nash died soon after construction started impeding its progress . The square was to be named for William IV commemorating his ascent to the throne in 1830 . Around 1835 , it was decided that the square would be named after the Battle of Trafalgar as suggested by architect George Ledwell Taylor , commemorating Nelson 's victory over the French and Spanish in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars . 
 After the clearance , development progressed slowly . The National Gallery was built on the north side between 1832 and 1838 to a design by William Wilkins , and in 1837 the Treasury approved Wilkins ' plan for the laying out of the square , but it was not put into effect . In April 1840 , following Wilkins ' death , new plans by Charles Barry were accepted , and construction started within weeks . For Barry , as for Wilkins , a major consideration was increasing the visual impact of the National Gallery , which had been widely criticised for its lack of grandeur . He dealt with the complex sloping site by excavating the main area to the level of the footway between <unk> Street and the Strand , and constructing a 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high balustraded terrace with a roadway on the north side , and steps at each end leading to the main level . Wilkins had proposed a similar solution with a central flight of steps . <unk> were provided for sculpture and pedestals for lighting . All the stonework was of Aberdeen granite . In 1841 it was decided that two fountains should be included in the layout . The estimated budget , excluding paving and sculptures , was £ 11 @,@ 000 . The earth removed was used to level Green Park . The square was originally surfaced with <unk> , which was replaced with stone in the 1920s . 
 Trafalgar Square was opened to the public on 1 May 1844 . 
 = = = Nelson 's Column = = = 
 Nelson 's Column was planned independently of Barry 's work . In 1838 a Nelson Memorial Committee had approached the government proposing that a monument to the victor of Trafalgar , funded by public subscription , should be erected in the square . A competition was held and won by the architect William Railton , who proposed a 218 feet 3 inches ( 66 @.@ 52 m ) <unk> column topped by a statue of Nelson and guarded by four sculpted lions . The design was approved , but received widespread objections from the public . Construction went ahead beginning in 1840 but with the height reduced to 145 feet 3 inches ( 44 @.@ 27 m ) . The column was completed and the statue raised in November 1843 . 
 The last of the bronze reliefs on the column 's pedestals was not completed until May 1854 , and the four lions , although part of the original design , were only added in 1867 . Landseer , the sculptor , had asked for a lion that had died at the London Zoo to be brought to his studio . He took so long to complete sketches that its corpse began to decompose and some parts had to be improvised . The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions . 
 Barry was unhappy about Nelson 's Column being placed in the square . In July 1840 , when its foundations had been laid , he told a parliamentary select committee that " it would in my opinion be desirable that the area should be wholly free from all insulated objects of art " . A hoarding remained around the base of Nelson 's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place . 
 In 1940 the Nazi SS developed secret plans to transfer Nelson 's Column to Berlin after an expected German invasion , as related by Norman Longmate in If Britain Had Fallen ( 1972 ) . 
 = = = Redevelopment = = = 
 A major 18 @-@ month redevelopment of the square led by W.S. Atkins with Foster and Partners as sub @-@ consultants was completed in 2003 . The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides of the square , demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace in front of the National Gallery . The construction includes two lifts for disabled access , public toilets and a café . Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners .

 Barry 's scheme provided two plinths for sculptures on the north side of the square . A bronze equestrian statue of George IV by Sir Francis Chantrey , originally intended to be placed on top of the Marble Arch , was installed on the eastern plinth in 1844 , while the other remained empty until the late @-@ 20th century . There are two other statues on plinths , both installed during the 19th century : General Sir Charles James Napier by George Cannon Adams in the south @-@ west corner in 1855 , and Major @-@ General Sir Henry Havelock by William <unk> in the south @-@ east in 1861 . In 2000 , the Mayor of London , Ken Livingstone , suggested replacing the statues with figures more familiar to the general public .

 In the 21st century , the empty plinth in the north @-@ west corner of the square , the " Fourth Plinth " , has been used to show specially commissioned artworks . The scheme was initiated by the Royal Society of Arts and continued by the Fourth Plinth Commission , appointed by the Mayor of London . 
 A new sculpture , The Gift Horse designed by Hans Haacke was installed on the fourth plinth on 5 March 2015 . It is a model of a horse 's skeleton with a live display of the London Stock Exchange . 
 = = = Other statues = = = 
 There are three busts of admirals against the north wall of the square . Those of Lord Jellicoe by Sir Charles Wheeler and Lord Beatty , by William MacMillan were installed in 1948 in conjunction with the square 's fountains , which also commemorate them . The third , of the Second World War First Sea Lord Admiral Cunningham by <unk> Belsky was unveiled alongside them on 2 April 1967 . 
 On the south side on the site of the original Charing Cross , is a bronze equestrian statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur . It was cast in 1633 , and placed in its present position in 1678 . 
 The two statues on the lawn in front of the National Gallery are the statue of James II by Grinling Gibbons to the west of the portico , and of one George Washington , a replica of a work by Jean @-@ Antoine Houdon , to the east that was a gift from the Commonwealth of Virginia installed in 1921 . 
 Two statues erected in the 19th century have since been removed . One of Edward Jenner , pioneer of the smallpox vaccine , was set up in the south @-@ west corner of the square in 1858 , next to that of Napier . Sculpted by William Calder Marshall , it showed Jenner sitting in a chair in a relaxed pose , and was inaugurated at a ceremony presided over by Prince Albert . It was moved to Kensington Gardens in 1862 . The other , of General Charles George Gordon by Hamo Thornycroft , was erected on an 18 @-@ foot high pedestal between the fountains in 1888 . It was removed in 1943 and re @-@ sited on the Victoria Embankment ten years later . 
 = = Fountains = = 
 In 1841 , following suggestions from the local paving board , Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from the asphalt surface . The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly . The fountains were fed from two wells , one in front of the National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel . Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery . 
 In the late @-@ 1930s it was decided to replace the pump and the centrepieces of the fountains . The new centrepieces , designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens , were memorials to Lord Jellicoe and Lord Beatty , although busts of the admirals , initially intended to be placed in the fountain surrounds were placed against the northern retaining wall when the project was completed after the Second World War . The fountains cost almost £ 50 @,@ 000 . The old ones were presented to the Canadian government and are now located in Ottawa 's Confederation Park and Regina 's Wascana Centre . 
 A programme of restoration was completed by May 2009 . The pump system was replaced with one capable of sending an 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) jet of water into the air . A LED lighting system that can project different combinations of colours on to the fountains was installed to reduce the cost of lighting maintenance and to coincide with the 2012 Summer Olympics . 
 = = Pigeons = = 
 The square was once famous for feral pigeons and feeding them was a popular activity . Pigeons began flocking to the square before construction was completed and feed sellers became well known in the Victorian era . The desirability of the birds ' presence was contentious : their droppings disfigured the stonework and the flock , estimated at its peak to be 35 @,@ 000 , was considered a health hazard . A stall seller , Bernie Rayner , infamously sold bird seed to tourists at inflated prices . 
 In February 2001 , the sale of bird seed in the square was stopped and other measures were introduced to discourage the pigeons including the use of birds of prey . Supporters continued to feed the birds but in 2003 the mayor , Ken Livingstone , enacted bylaws to ban feeding them in the square . In September 2007 Westminster City Council passed further bylaws banning feeding birds on the pedestrianised North Terrace and other pavements in the area . Nelson 's column was repaired from years of damage from pigeon droppings at a cost of £ 140 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Events = = 
 = = = New Year = = = 
 For many years , revellers celebrating the New Year have gathered in the square despite a lack of celebrations being arranged . The lack of official events was partly because the authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding . Since 2003 , a firework display centred on the London Eye and South Bank of the Thames has been provided as an alternative . Since 2014 , New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority in conjunction with the charity Unicef , who began ticketing the event to control crowd numbers . 
 = = = Christmas = = = 
 A Christmas ceremony has been held in the square every year since 1947 . A Norway spruce ( or sometimes a fir ) is presented by Norway 's capital city , Oslo as London 's Christmas tree , a token of gratitude for Britain 's support during World War II . ( Besides war @-@ time support , Norway 's Prince Olav and the country 's government lived in exile in London throughout the war . ) 
 The Christmas tree is decorated with lights that are switched on at a seasonal ceremony . It is usually held twelve days before Christmas Day . The festivity is open to the public and attracts a large number of people . The switch @-@ on is usually followed by several nights of Christmas carol singing and other performances and events . On the twelfth night of Christmas , the tree is taken down for recycling . Westminster City Council threatened to abandon the event to save £ 5 @,@ 000 in 1980 but the decision was reversed . 
 The tree is selected by the Head Forester from Oslo 's municipal forest and shipped , across the North Sea to the Port of Felixstowe , then by road to Trafalgar Square . The first tree was 48 feet ( 15 m ) tall , but more recently has been around 75 feet ( 23 m ) . In 1987 , protesters chained themselves to the tree . In 1990 , a man sawed into the tree with a chainsaw a few hours before a New Year 's Eve party was scheduled to take place . He was arrested and the tree was repaired by tree surgeons who removed gouged sections from the trunk while the tree was suspended from a crane . 
 = = = Political demonstrations = = = 
 The square has become a social and political focus for visitors and Londoners , developing over its history from " an esplanade peopled with figures of national heroes , into the country 's foremost place politique " , as historian Rodney Mace has written . Since its construction , it has been a venue for political demonstrations . The great Chartist rally in 1848 , a campaign for social reform by the working class began in the square . A ban on political rallies remained in effect until the 1880s , when the emerging Labour movement , particularly the Social Democratic Federation , began holding protests . On 8 February 1886 ) ( also known as " Black Monday " ) , protesters rallied against unemployment leading to a riot in Pall Mall . A larger riot ( " Bloody Sunday " ) occurred in the square on 13 November 1887 . 
 The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament 's first Aldermaston March , protesting against the Atomic Weapons Establishment ( AWE ) , began in the square in 1958 . One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square on 19 September 1961 by the Committee of 100 , which included the philosopher Bertrand Russell . The protesters rallied for peace and against war and nuclear weapons . In March 1968 , a crowd of 10 @,@ 000 demonstrated against US involvement in the Vietnam War before marching to the American Embassy in Grosvenor Square . 
 Throughout the 1980s , a continuous anti @-@ apartheid protest was held outside South Africa House . In 1990 , the Poll Tax Riots began by a demonstration attended by 200 @,@ 000 people and ultimately caused rioting in the surrounding area . More recently , there have been anti @-@ war demonstrations opposing the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War . A large vigil was held shortly after the terrorist bombings in London on Thursday , 7 July 2005 . 
 In December 2009 , participants from the Camp for Climate Action occupied the square for the two weeks during which the UN Conference on Climate Change took place in Copenhagen . It was billed as a UK base for direct action on climate change and saw various actions and protests stem from the occupation . 
 In March 2011 , the square was occupied by a crowd protesting against the UK Budget and proposed budget cuts . During the night the situation turned violent as the escalation by riot police and protesters damaged portions of the square . In November 2015 a vigil against the terrorist attacks in Paris was held . Crowds sang the French national anthem , La Marseillaise , and held banners in support of the city and country . 
 Every year on the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar ( 21 October ) , the Sea Cadet Corps holds a parade in honour of Admiral Lord Nelson and the British victory over the combined fleets of Spain and France at Trafalgar . The Royal British Legion holds a Silence in the Square event on Armistice Day , 11 November , in remembrance of those who died in war . The event includes music and poetry readings , culminating in a bugler playing the Last Post and a two @-@ minute silence at 11 am .

 In the 21st century , Trafalgar Square has been the location for several sporting events and victory parades . In June 2002 , 12 @,@ 000 people gathered to watch the England national football team 's World Cup quarter @-@ final against Brazil on giant video screens which had been erected for the occasion . The square was used by the England national rugby union team on 9 December 2003 to celebrate their victory in the 2003 Rugby World Cup , and on 13 September 2005 for the England national cricket team 's victory in the Ashes series . 
 On 6 July 2005 Trafalgar Square hosted the announcement of London 's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics .

 HIAG ( German : <unk> auf <unk> der <unk> der <unk> Waffen @-@ SS , literally " Mutual aid association of former Waffen @-@ SS members " ) was a lobby group and a revisionist veteran 's organisation founded by former high @-@ ranking Waffen @-@ SS personnel in West Germany in 1951 . Its main objective was to achieve legal , economic and historical rehabilitation of the Waffen @-@ SS . 
 To achieve its aims , the organisation used contacts with political parties and employed multi @-@ prong historical revisionism and propaganda efforts , including periodicals , books and public speeches . A HIAG @-@ owned publishing house , Munin Verlag , served as a platform for its publicity aims . This extensive body of work — 57 book titles and more than 50 years of monthly periodicals — has been described by historians as revisionist apologia . 
 Always in touch with its Nazi past , HIAG was a subject of significant controversy , both in West Germany and abroad . The organisation drifted into right @-@ wing extremism in its later history ; it was disbanded in 1992 at the federal level , but local groups , along with the organisation 's monthly periodical , continued to exist into the 21st century . 
 While HIAG only partially achieved its goals of legal and economic rehabilitation of Waffen @-@ SS , its propaganda efforts led to the reshaping of the image of Waffen @-@ SS in popular culture . The results are still felt , with scholarly treatments being out @-@ weighed by a large amount of amateur historical studies , memoirs , picture books , websites and wargames . 
 = = Post @-@ World War II context = = 
 The Potsdam Conference held by the Soviet Union , United Kingdom and United States from 17 July to 2 August 1945 determined the occupation policies that the Allied @-@ occupied Germany was to face . These included demilitarisation , denazification , democratisation and decentralisation . The Allies ' attempts were often perceived by the population as " victors ' justice " and met with limited success . For those in the Western zones of occupation , the arrival of the Cold War undermined these policies further by reviving the ideas of the necessity to fight against Soviet communism , echoing those of Hitler . 
 Another important post @-@ war development was the decision to rearm West Germany . In 1950 , after the outbreak of the Korean War , it became clear to the Western Allies that a German army would have to be revived to help face off against the Soviet Union . Many former German officers were convinced , however , that no future German army would be possible without the moral rehabilitation of the Wehrmacht . To this end , in October 1950 , a group of former senior officers produced a document , which became known as the <unk> memorandum , for West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer . It included these key demands : 
 All German soldiers convicted as war criminals would be released ; 
 The " defamation " of the German soldier , including those of the Waffen @-@ SS , would have to cease ; 
 The " measures to transform both domestic and foreign public opinion " with regards to the German military would need to be taken . 
 Adenauer accepted these propositions and in turn advised the representatives of the three Western powers that German armed forces would not be possible as long as German soldiers remained in custody . To accommodate the West German government , the Allies commuted a number of war crimes sentences . Public declaration from Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower followed in January 1951 , which read in part : 
 I have come to know that there is a real difference between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group . For my part , I do not believe that the German soldier as such has lost his honor . The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers . 
 In the same year ( 1951 ) , some former career officers of the Wehrmacht were granted war pensions under the Basic Law . Unlike the Wehrmacht , the SS had been deemed a criminal organisation at the Nuremberg trials and could thus act as an " alibi of a nation " ( as Gerald Reitlinger 's 1956 book of that title suggested ) . The SS was the entity onto which all crimes of the Nazi regime were conveniently shifted . Consequently , Waffen @-@ SS career soldiers were not covered under the 1951 law . 
 In 1949 , the political climate was changing and the ban on forming veterans ' associations had been lifted . Encouraged by the shifting tone of the World War II discourse and the courting of the Wehrmacht veterans by the West German government and political parties , former Waffen @-@ SS members came forward to campaign for their rights . 
 = = Formation = = 
 HIAG began in late 1950 as a loose association of local so @-@ called support groups . The majority of participants were officers , most often of junior grades . In the summer of 1951 , HIAG was formally established by Otto Kumm , a former SS @-@ Brigadeführer . By October 1951 , HIAG consisted of 376 local branches . 
 = = = Leadership = = = 
 In December 1951 , former high @-@ ranking Waffen @-@ SS general Paul Hausser became HIAG 's first spokesperson . Two well @-@ known former Waffen @-@ SS commanders — Felix Steiner and Herbert Otto Gille — became early leading figures . Sepp Dietrich and Kurt Meyer became active members upon their release from prison , in 1955 and 1954 respectively ; Meyer became HIAG 's most effective spokesman . After Meyer 's death in 1961 , Erich Eberhardt , formerly of SS Division Totenkopf , assumed that role . As of 1977 , Wilhelm Bittrich served as the chairman ; as of 1976 Hubert Meyer acted as the federal spokesperson . 
 Ostensibly , HIAG existed to provide aid to veterans , but it included many members who were convicted war criminals . These included Bittrich , Dietrich , Meyer and Gustav Lombard . Kumm managed to avoid extradition to Yugoslavia to stand trial for war crimes by fleeing over the wall of the Dachau internment camp . 
 = = = Organisational principles = = = 
 With the publication of its first periodical in late 1951 , HIAG was beginning to draw attention to itself and generate public controversy , including speculation that it was a neo @-@ Nazi organisation . In response , Hausser wrote an open letter to the Bundestag denying these accusations and describing the HIAG as an advocacy organisation for former Waffen @-@ SS troops . Hausser asserted that its members rejected all forms of radicalism and were " upstanding citizens " . 
 The HIAG bylaws of 1952 described the aims of the organisation as providing comradeship , legal assistance , support for those in Allied captivity , help for families , and aid in searches for those still missing . The HIAG campaigned for Waffen @-@ SS veterans to be awarded the legal status of " persons formerly in the public service " under article 131 of the Basic Law , so that they would qualify for the same rights and pensions as Wehrmacht 's career soldiers . 
 The historian David C. Large wrote that , like any public pronouncements , these bylaws did not tell the full story about HIAG 's real goals . By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice , he was able to tease out what the organisation stood for . For example , HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen @-@ SS membership , surviving and fallen , as well as their families : 500 @,@ 000 in total . In reality , the organisation 's rolls did not exceed 20 @,@ 000 . HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s , and held it until the early 1960s . 
 The organisation also asserted that the Waffen @-@ SS was merely " the fourth arm of the Wehrmacht " ; these claims were even " more dubious " , explains Large . As a Nazi organisation combining both military and police powers , the Waffen @-@ SS was a military arm of the SS : its members stood under SS jurisdiction separate from that of the Wehrmacht ; personnel transitioned smoothly between the frontline formations , punitive detachments and SS concentration camp organisation ; and the frontline units themselves were thoroughly implicated in war crimes during the campaigns in the West and in the East , and in the atrocities against civilian population in the Soviet Union and Poland . 
 On the other hand , as the war progressed and the Waffen @-@ SS grew to encompass conscripts ( from 1943 ) , Waffen @-@ SS personnel began to resemble that of the Wehrmacht , contributing to the postwar confusion as to the organisation 's status . It allowed the Waffen @-@ SS proponents to advance the idea of Waffen @-@ SS men being " soldiers like all other " — the phrase first put forth in HIAG 's materials , and later publicly used by Chancellor Adenauer . Large argues that the equivalence is meaningless , as , contrary to the myth of a clean Wehrmacht , it actively participated in the racial war of extermination in the Soviet Union . 
 = = = Ideology = = = 
 Although political affiliations were discouraged by HIAG 's leaders , any leanings were to be " in the spirit of European and patriotic sentiment " , as described in a 1951 issue of Wiking @-@ Ruf ( " Viking Call " ) , HIAG 's first publication . Internal disagreements began to emerge in the mid @-@ 1950s as to the stance of the organisation : Steiner , Gille and Meyer favored a more political , outspoken orientation . The rest of the leadership favored a moderate approach in order not to jeopardise HIAG 's goals of legal and economic rehabilitation , which , in their opinion , could only come from the establishment : the government and the Bundestag . 
 = = Waffen @-@ SS advocacy = = 
 The main stated aims of the organisation were to provide assistance to veterans and campaign for the rehabilitation of their legal status with respect to war pensions . During its early existence , HIAG also focused on " help @-@ find @-@ lost @-@ comrades " actions ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) . 
 = = = Tracing service meetings = = = 
 HIAG embraced the <unk> activities , not only because it was concerned for the fate of some 40 @,@ 000 members of the Waffen @-@ SS who were missing in action , but because this outwardly humanitarian and non @-@ political activity could help improve its perception by the West German government and the society at large . Such public relations activities ( " image polishing " , according to Large ) were important to HIAG as it faced on @-@ going scrutiny , and even calls for a ban on the organisation . The <unk> events ( literally : tracing service meetings ) later evolved into annual <unk> ( " veterans ' reunions " ) , which were in fact large @-@ scale conventions , often accompanied by rallies . 
 = = = Inaugural convention = = = 
 In 1952 , the organisation held its first major meeting in Verden . It began respectably , with Otto Gille announcing that the veterans were ready to " do their duty for the Fatherland " and Steiner declaring support for " freedom , order and justice " . But the next speaker delivered a different message . Hermann @-@ Bernhard Ramcke , a former paratroop general and a convicted war criminal , invited to demonstrate so @-@ called solidarity with the Wehrmacht , condemned the Western Allies as the " real war criminals " and insisted that the blacklist on which all former SS members then stood would soon become " a list of honour " . 
 The outburst caused a furor within West Germany . Periodicals as far as the U.S. and Canada carried headlines Hitler 's Guard Cheers Ex @-@ chief and Rabble @-@ <unk> General Is Worrying the Allies , with the latter article reporting that Ramcke 's speech had been greeted with " roars of approval and cries of ' Eisenhower , <unk> ! ' ( ' Pig – Dog ' ) " . HIAG and its spokesperson Steiner hastily tried to distance the organisation from Ramcke and his remarks . Subsequent conventions , which were in effect used for political purposes , added to the controversy surrounding the organisation . ( See also " Controversies " section below . ) 
 = = = Waffen @-@ SS war criminals as victims = = = 
 The notion that Waffen @-@ SS personnel had been " soldiers like all others " found its way into the discourse of war captivity . HIAG claimed that its members were victims of victor 's justice and complained of harsh internment conditions . HIAG equated the status of prisoners of war with that of war criminals , obfuscating the differences between the Wehrmacht and the Waffen @-@ SS . 
 Along with other veterans ' organisations , HIAG campaigned for the immediate amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity . This issue was significant , as most of these organisations made their cooperation in the area of rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area . It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release . Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour . 
 In its periodical Wiking @-@ Ruf , HIAG made use of the same drawings of emaciated German POWs behind barbed wire used by the publications of another post @-@ war organisation — the West German Association of Returnees and Families of POWs and <unk> ( VdH ) . War captivity was depicted as the last stage of the so @-@ called ordinary military career in the Waffen @-@ SS in books and publications of the HIAG . In its turn , VdH saw its role as a peace @-@ seeking counterbalance to militaristic veterans ' organisations such as HIAG and explicitly distanced itself from them in the early 1950s . 
 = = = Relationship with political parties = = = 
 Behind the scenes , HIAG cultivated close relationships with the ruling Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) and the main opposition Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , garnering attention by inflating its membership numbers and influence . In meetings with politicians in the early 1950s , HIAG claimed to represent 2 million potential voters , a vast exaggeration as only 250 @,@ 000 Waffen @-@ SS veterans were living in West Germany at that time . 
 HIAG was successful in stoking politicians ' fears that millions of disaffected former soldiers would be a threat to the nascent West German democracy . That is perhaps why SPD leader Kurt Schumacher , who himself had been persecuted by the Nazis , decided to establish contact with HIAG . When he first met with its leaders in 1951 , Schumacher believed that 150 @,@ 000 people were already members of HIAG , as evidenced by internal party correspondence ; he considered that number to be " politically significant " . In the same letter , Schumacher referred to the Waffen @-@ SS as a " branch of the Wehrmacht " . 
 Later , the SPD defence policy expert Fritz Erler ( politician ) and Helmut Schmidt , a member of SPD parliamentary delegation and a future Chancellor of West Germany , handled the relationship with HIAG . They maintained close contact , attending private and public meetings and keeping regular correspondence . They often admonished HIAG leadership for the membership 's " undemocratic " ways , but these efforts at reforming the veterans were futile . Such dealing with the " <unk> " ( <unk> ) only succeeded in causing concerns within SPD , as evidenced by internal party correspondence , where HIAG 's members were thus described ( " <unk> " ) . 
 HIAG found its best champion in the centre @-@ right Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) , whose platform was most closely aligned to its goals . The FDP voted against the de @-@ <unk> process in 1950 ; demanded the release of all " so @-@ called war criminals " in 1951 ( as the war criminals were largely termed in West Germany at that time ) ; and welcomed the establishment of veterans ' organisation of former Wehrmacht and Waffen @-@ SS members . However , as only a coalition partner to the larger CDU and SPD , it could not deliver on what HIAG wanted ; hence , the main thrust of HIAG 's lobbying was directed at CDU and SPD , especially during the election years . 
 = = = Controversies = = = 
 HIAG took on the cause of those imprisoned or executed for war crimes and openly celebrated its Nazi past . Below is a partial list of ensuing controversies in the first 12 years of HIAG 's existence : 
 In 1953 , HIAG <unk> staged a torchlit procession for a " solstice celebration " ( the manner in which Christmas was celebrated in Nazi Germany ) . They marched up to <unk> Castle in Bavaria , chanting Nazi songs , including This Is the Guard that Adolf Hitler Loves . 
 In 1954 , plans for a HIAG convention in Göttingen faced strong opposition from the local Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , the Jewish Council , the Students ' Association and the University hierarchy . Federal government officials intervened , and the event was first postponed and then scaled down to a much smaller meeting lacking the qualities of a political event . 
 Following the reburial of executed war criminals in Hamelin in 1954 , the cemetery became the focal point for veterans ' reunions , with distinct Nazi overtones . In 1959 , the HIAG convention in Hamelin attracted a crowd of 15 @,@ 000 and concluded with " comrades gathering around the tomb " of Bernhard <unk> , a convicted war criminal who had been executed in 1949 . 
 Also in 1959 , the Interior Minister of Hesse prohibited the holding of a HIAG <unk> citing the German Red Cross 's decision not to lend its support due to these meetings being " superfluous " . 
 In 1961 , HIAG attempted to place a glorifying obituary of Max Simon , a former Gruppenführer in the SS , in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine . Simon had been convicted as a war criminal and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Allied courts for his role in the Marzabotto massacre , but was pardoned in 1954 . He was subsequently tried twice in the Federal courts for the killings in <unk> and other crimes , but , " to the horror of the West German public " , as Frankfurter Allgemeine wrote in 2010 , was found not guilty . To HIAG 's indignation , Frankfurter Allgemeine refused to run the obituary . 
 In 1963 , a HIAG convention planned for the city of Hamelin had to be cancelled at short notice , due to public pressure . 
 Large , who studied HIAG extensively , stated in 1987 that HIAG 's anti @-@ democratic and anti @-@ Semitic public statements were " the essence of what HIAG was all about " , concluding that the HIAG 's leaders remained true to their Nazi ideology . Similarly , the historian Karsten Wilke , who worked with the HIAG archives in the 2000s , discovered that the HIAG members ' positions were " consistently racist , anti @-@ Semitic and anti @-@ democratic " , as the German news magazine Der Spiegel described in its 2011 investigative article " The Brown Bluff : How Waffen SS Veterans Exploited Postwar Politics " . Referencing Wilke 's work , Der Spiegel quoted a HIAG member 's letter to the leadership conveying the dismay at " Jews " who became " powerful once again " and could thus stand in the way of political support for the Waffen @-@ SS rehabilitation . Spiegel also reported Wilke 's findings that the HIAG leadership maintained close contacts with far @-@ right groups . 
 = = = Results = = = 
 Lobbying by HIAG and other revisionists produced some early successes . In 1953 , Chancellor Adenauer announced in a public speech in Hannover that members of the combat formations of the Waffen @-@ SS had been " soldiers just like the rest " who had been " simply drafted " . ( Large describes this declaration as " irresponsible and unhistorical " , while the military historian S.P. MacKenzie refers to it , when used in reference to the Western Front , as " the least credible " of the several claims put forth by Waffen @-@ SS apologists . He points out that , in the East , the Wehrmacht equaled the Waffen @-@ SS in its brutality , so the attempted equivalence was " rather ironic " . ) 
 In the following months , a number of war criminals from the ranks of the Waffen @-@ SS were released . Many of them were made eligible for prisoner @-@ of @-@ war compensation from local governments . In 1956 the Federal Ministry of Defence announced that former members of the Waffen @-@ SS , up to the grade of lieutenant colonel , would be accepted to the Bundeswehr at their old rank . 
 Former Waffen @-@ SS men who wished to join the Bundeswehr still faced heightened scrutiny . All Waffen @-@ SS applicants went through the rigorous vetting process reserved only for those with the higher ranks in the Wehrmacht . HIAG protested to the government and its military planners , but to no avail . As a result , by September 1956 , only 33 of 1310 applications by ex @-@ Waffen @-@ SS officers had been accepted ( making them 0 @.@ 4 % of the Bundeswehr 's officer corps ) , as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men . 
 At its height in the early 1960s around 8 % of the approximately 250 @,@ 000 former Waffen @-@ SS members living in West Germany were members of HIAG . This was the timeframe when HIAG achieved its last success in the economic rehabilitation : in 1961 , the West German government partially restored pension rights to Waffen @-@ SS personnel under the 131 legislation . Included were those former Waffen @-@ SS members who had served for a minimum of 10 years strictly in the military capacity , thus amounting to a tiny number of eligible personnel . HIAG greeted this development as a partial victory , which they hoped would lead to a complete rehabilitation . 
 But this wider aim proved impossible to achieve : the government was circumspect as rehabilitating the Waffen @-@ SS would have opened the door to claims by personnel of other SS and Nazi organisations , including SA , SD , Hitler Youth , and others — a prospect the federal government would rather not have raised either domestically or internationally . The public image of the organisation was not helping either , because some of the more outspoken HIAG members sounded " alarmingly Nazi in their pronouncements " , according to Large . 
 = = Waffen @-@ SS historical revisionism = = 
 During the Nuremberg Trials , Waffen @-@ SS personnel , such as Hausser in his testimony as a defence witness , contended that it was a purely military organisation no different from the Wehrmacht . The prosecution at Nuremberg rejected that claim and successfully argued that the Waffen @-@ SS was an integral part of the SS apparatus . The Tribunal found that " the units of the Waffen @-@ SS were directly involved in the killings of the prisoners of war and the atrocities in the occupied countries " and judged the entire SS to be a criminal organisation . 
 HIAG aimed to reverse that judgement through significant propaganda efforts in the service of its historical revisionism . HIAG 's rewriting of history encompassed multi @-@ prong publicity campaigns , including tendentious periodicals , books and public speeches , alongside with a publishing house dedicated to presenting the Waffen @-@ SS in a positive light . Restoring the " tarnished shield " was viewed by the leadership as a key component of the desired legal and economic rehabilitation , and thus no effort was spared . 
 = = = Periodicals and illustrated books = = = 
 HIAG 's first periodical was Wiking @-@ Ruf . It was launched by Gille in 1951 and was initially aimed at the veterans of the SS Division Wiking . Within its first year of existence , it became the official publication of HIAG . In 1955 , it was renamed Der Freiwillige ( " The Volunteer " ) . The 1952 editorial by Kumm highlighted key themes that were used throughout HIAG 's subsequent history : 
 Even during the war , and especially after the war , infamous and lying propagandists have been able to make use of all the unfortunate events connected to the Third Reich and also with the SS to destroy and drag through the mud all of what was and is sacred to us . ( ... ) Let us be clear about it : the [ Allied ] battle was directed not only the authoritarian regime of the Third Reich , but , above all , against the resurgence of the strength of the German people . 
 Erich Kern , a far @-@ right Austrian journalist and a former Nazi war correspondent , became the organisation 's key employee responsible for its publishing arm . He first became active within HIAG in 1955 , and then joined as a full @-@ time employee in 1959 . ( Until his death in 1991 , Kern remained an " unrepentant and unreconstructed Nazi " , according to the historian Jonathan Petropoulos . ) 
 The theme of foreign volunteers was featured prominently , with Steiner lending his voice in this area . In an 1958 editorial , he praised the foreign volunteers who , like their German comrades , saw the " diabolical " threat of Bolshevism and " fought like lions " against it as part of the Waffen @-@ SS . The picture books echoed the same themes ; one of them proclaimed : " From all European lands came volunteers as genuine comrades @-@ in @-@ arms . They fought for their Fatherland against Bolshevism . " 
 Glossy books such as Waffen @-@ SS in Pictures ( 1957 ) featured , as described by MacKenzie , " tales of valour and heroism " and " propaganda photographs of Aryan @-@ ideal volunteers from all over the Continent " . In 1973 , HIAG produced a five @-@ hundred page SS picture tome under the nostalgic title When All Our Brothers Are Silent ; the project was spearheaded by Hausser , with Jochen Peiper , a controversial Waffen @-@ SS figure , as a contributor . Other similar books included Scattered are the Traces ( 1979 ) , Cavalry Divisions of the Waffen @-@ SS ( 1982 ) , Panzer Grenadiers of the ' Viking ' Division in Pictures ( 1984 ) and many others . ( One of the cavalry units in question , SS Cavalry Brigade , was responsible for the murder of an estimated 23 @,@ 700 Jews and others in July – August 1941 alone during the Pripyat swamps punitive operation . Its regimental commander Lombard reported eliminating close to 11 @,@ 000 " plunderers " in the first two weeks the same operation . ) 
 = = = Public speeches = = = 
 HIAG leadership denied that there was any connection between the Waffen @-@ SS and Nazi atrocities . In 1957 , Paul Hausser wrote an open letter in Der <unk> to West Germany 's minister of defence , stating that the concentration camp guard units ( SS @-@ Totenkopfverbände ) served on external detail only , " without the possibility of interfering with the internal procedure " . He did not mention that the guards accompanied prisoners to labour sites and that the commanders of concentration camps generally came from the Waffen @-@ SS . This apologist position also ignored the fact that the organisational structure of the SS tied Waffen @-@ SS to the Nazi annihilation machine through transfer of personnel between various SS units and the shifting responsibilities of the units themselves , as they may perform frontline duties at one time and then be reassigned to " pacification actions " , the Nazi term for punitive operations in the rear . 
 Kurt Meyer embodied the voice of Waffen @-@ SS apologists . Speaking before some 8000 SS men at the HIAG convention in <unk> , Bavaria , in 1957 , he stated that " SS troops committed no crimes , except the massacre at Oradour , and that was the action of a single man " , who , moreover had died a " hero 's death " before he could be court @-@ martialed . Meyer also insisted that the Waffen @-@ SS was a regular army outfit , just like any in the Wehrmacht . On another occasion , Meyer publicly denounced the " regime " [ West Germany ] that could " honour traitors " but would vilify its soldiers . He condemned the notion of " collective guilt " and equated Jews and Jesuits to the Nazis and the Waffen @-@ SS as all being victims of history and prejudice . In the first instance , Meyer was most likely referencing Adolf <unk> who was the senior officer present during the Oradour massacre . Meyer himself had served a lengthy prison term for his role in the Ardenne Abbey massacre . In the second instance , he was apparently referring to the members of the 20 July plot . 
 The rhetoric of <unk> and pan @-@ European unity continued well into the later history of HIAG . At Peiper 's memorial in 1976 , Hubert Meyer referenced Peiper 's open letter from Landsberg Prison , which had been previously quoted in Hausser 's 1953 books : 
 For a broad public in Germany and even more throughout the rest of the world , [ Peiper ] has become the embodiment of that which all of us were clearly , intentionally and wrongly burdened in Nuremberg .... We have not forgotten what Jochen Peiper wrote to us from Landsberg Prison in 1952 : " Don 't forget that the first Europeans killed in action were in the units of the Waffen @-@ SS , that the one beaten to death during the post war period mostly were men from our ranks . They had become fair game because of their belief in the indivisibility of Western Europe . Remember these martyrs " . 
 = = = Memoirs = = = 
 The memoirs by HIAG 's leading members portrayed Waffen @-@ SS men as " misunderstood idealists who fought honourably and well " and included testimonials by former Wehrmacht generals endorsing the fighting skills of the Waffen @-@ SS . Steiner 's , Meyer 's and Hausser 's books have been characterised by historian Charles Sydnor as the " most important works of [ Waffen @-@ SS ] apologist literature " . They demanded rehabilitation of the military branch of the Nazi Party and presented Waffen @-@ SS members as both victims and misunderstood heroes . Nothing was said on the Nazi indoctrination of the troops or the atrocities committed by them . 
 Paul Hausser 's 1953 book Waffen @-@ SS in Action ( Waffen @-@ SS im Einsatz ) was the first major work by one of the HIAG leaders . It had an unmistakable connection to the Nazi origins of the Waffen @-@ SS : the SS runes on the cover art and the SS motto ( " My honour is called loyalty " ) embossed on the cloth cover . Former Wehrmacht general Hans Guderian endorsed Waffen @-@ SS troops in a foreword and referred to them as " the first realisation of the European idea " . Hausser went on to describe the growth of Waffen @-@ SS into a so @-@ called multinational force where foreign volunteers fought heroically as a " militant example of the great European idea " . Waffen @-@ SS in Action was included in the index of objectionable war books maintained by West Germany 's Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons . The index was created in 1960 to limit the sale of such works to minors due to their chauvinism and glorification of violence . 
 Kurt Meyer 's memoirs , Grenadiers ( German : <unk> ) , published in 1957 , detailed his exploits at the front and served as an element of the rehabilitation campaign . He condemned the " inhuman suffering " that the Waffen @-@ SS personnel had been subjected to " for crimes which they neither committed , nor were able to prevent " . Sydnor referred to <unk> as " perhaps the boldest and most truculent of the apologist works " . 
 Felix Steiner published The Volunteers of Waffen @-@ SS : Idea and sacrifice ( German : Die Freiwilligen der Waffen @-@ SS : <unk> und <unk> ) in 1958 . It presented the sacrifice messages echoing those of Der Freiwillige and stressed the theme of the purely military Waffen @-@ SS . 
 Both Hausser and Steiner followed up their 1950s books with works published in the 1960s . Published in 1963 , Steiner 's book was called The Army of Outlaws ( " Die Armee der <unk> " ) . Hausser 's work appeared in 1966 under the title Soldiers Like Any Other ( " Soldaten wie andere auch " ) . According to MacKenzie , the books ' titles were symbolic of the Waffen @-@ SS image that HIAG 's leaders wanted to portray , while Sydnor describes this later generation of books as " equally tendentious " . 
 Prior to the establishment of HIAG 's own publishing house Munin Verlag ( below ) , HIAG @-@ affiliated books were predominantly published by <unk> Verlag in Göttingen , owned by an extreme right @-@ wing politician and publisher Waldemar Schütz . 
 = = = Munin Verlag imprint = = = 
 HIAG established its own publishing house — Munin Verlag — in 1958 . The name comes from Norse mythology , popular with the right @-@ wing movements . Muninn is one of the two ravens that are the companions of the war god Odin on the battlefield ; <unk> is Old Norse for " memory " . 
 The aim of the publishing house was to publish the works of former Waffen @-@ SS members , in cooperation with HIAG . The authors of the publishing house were former Waffen @-@ SS unit commanders or staff officers , who were members of HIAG . The Munin Verlag titles did not go through the rigorous fact @-@ checking processes common in the traditional historical literature ; they were revisionist accounts unedited by professional historians and presented the former Waffen @-@ SS members ' version of events . 
 Until HIAG 's dissolution in 1992 , Munin @-@ Verlag published 57 titles . The authors included Patrick Agte ; Willi Fey , Albert Frey ; Paul Hausser ; Otto Kumm ; Rudolf Lehmann ; Hubert Meyer ; Eberhard Wolfgang Möller ; Richard Schulze @-@ <unk> ; Franz Schreiber ; Hans <unk> ; Peter <unk> ; Ralf Tiemann ( Wilhelm Mohnke 's adjutant ) ; Wilhelm <unk> ; Karl Ullrich ; Otto Weidinger , among others . 
 = = = Unit histories and biographies = = = 
 Waffen @-@ SS unit histories were produced with the assistance from HIAG from the 1950s . Walter Harzer took on the role of the official historian of HIAG , in charge of coordinating the writing of the histories of Waffen @-@ SS divisions . HIAG worked with the German Federal Military Archive in Freiburg to screen materials donated to it for any information that may have implicated units and personnel in questionable activity . To legitimise its image , HIAG underwrote the publication of works by right @-@ wing academics sympathetic to the Waffen @-@ SS . 
 The unit narratives were extensive ( often in several volumes ) and strived for a so @-@ called official representation of their history , backed by maps and operational orders . MacKenzie points out that " the older or the more famous the unit , the larger the work — to the point where no less than five volumes and well over 2 @,@ 000 pages were devoted to the doings of the 2nd Panzer Division Das Reich " , authored by its former officer Otto Weidinger . 
 The French author Jean @-@ Paul Picaper , who studied the Oradour massacre that was perpetrated by the men of the Das Reich , notes the tendentious nature of Weidinger 's narrative : it provided a sanitized version of history without any references to massacres . He argues that the unit histories , like other HIAG publications , focused on the positive , " heroic " side of National Socialism . The researcher Danny S. Parker notes similar efforts undertaken to rewrite the history of the Leibstandarte division . HIAG worked with Rudolf Lehmann , chief of staff of 1st SS Panzer Corps , to produce what Parker calls an " <unk> multi @-@ volume chronicle " of the division , even including the Malmedy massacre . HIAG involved a legal consultant to make sure the account would be within the framework of the strict German laws prohibiting glorification of the Nazi past . The project also included the former chief of staff of the unit , Dietrich <unk> , who in 1952 produced a revisionist version of the massacre in his pamphlet Der Malmedy <unk> . 
 In the mid- to late 1970s , HIAG attempted to commission a favorable biography of Peiper , to stop " the bad rumors " , according to a HIAG official . " We must steadfastly remain behind the wheel and direct this book ourselves , otherwise [ Erich Kern ] will do it " , Harzer wrote to a fellow member in 1976 . HIAG contemplated approaching ( or approached ) Herbert <unk> , a prolific screenwriter who had served in a propaganda company ( <unk> ) of the Waffen @-@ SS , but nothing came out of it . 
 = = = Successes and outcomes = = = 
 By the mid @-@ 1950s , HIAG established an image that separated the Waffen @-@ SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes that could not be denied to the Allgemeine @-@ SS ( security and police ) , the SS @-@ Totenkopfverbände and the Einsatzgruppen . The Waffen @-@ SS was thus successfully integrated into the myth of the clean Wehrmacht . 
 The positive image of the Waffen @-@ SS as an organisation indeed took root , and not only in Germany itself . In the era of the Cold War , senior Waffen @-@ SS personnel were " not shy about the fact that they had once organised a NATO @-@ like army , and an elite one at that " , notes MacKenzie ( emphasis in the original ) . John M. Steiner , in his 1975 work , points out that SS apologists , especially strongly represented in HIAG , stressed that they were the first to fight for Europe and Western civilisation against " Asiatic Communist hordes " . 
 Quoting German political journalist Karl Otto <unk> in his 1966 book , the historian George Stein writes that the works produced by HIAG 's circle were " trying to prove only what no tolerably informed person has ever attempted to deny , viz . , that the soldiers of the Waffen @-@ SS were brave fighters , suffered big losses and , as far as they served in the front line , did not run exterminations camps " . Stein notes that the apologists define the Waffen @-@ SS " in the narrowest of terms " and are silent on the matter of war crimes . He notes that only a minority of men were implicated in known atrocities and that the most historically significant role of the Waffen @-@ SS was in the battles for " Hitler 's Europe " . But " to recognise this is not to agree with the apologists who picture the overwhelming majority of the men of the Waffen @-@ SS as idealistic , clean @-@ living , decent and honourable soldiers " , Stein writes . 
 Wilke argues that , by the 1970s , HIAG attained a monopoly on the historical representation of the Waffen @-@ SS . Its recipe was simple and contained just four ingredients : 
 The Waffen @-@ SS was apolitical 
 It was elite 
 It was innocent of all war crimes or Nazi atrocities 
 It was a European army par excellence , the Army of Europe . 
 Historians dismiss , and even ridicule , this characterisation . Picaper labels it as a " self @-@ panegyric " , while Large uses the words " extravagant fantasies about [ Waffen @-@ SS 's ] past and future " . MacKenzie refers to HIAG 's body of work as a " chorus of self @-@ justification " and Stein as " apologetics " . The historian James M. Diehl describes HIAG 's claims of the Waffen @-@ SS being the so @-@ called fourth branch of the Wehrmacht as " false " , and HIAG 's insistence that the force was a precursor to NATO as " even more outrageous " . 
 = = Transition into right @-@ wing extremism = = 
 In the 1960s , it became clear that the legal rehabilitation of the Waffen @-@ SS was out of HIAG 's reach . At the same time , attitudes were beginning to change as the country emerged from a " decade of suppression of Germany 's Nazi past " . Waffen @-@ SS veterans ' activities were increasingly greeted by suspicion from the community , while the government and military planners came to the realisation that they could meet their goals of rearmament without them . HIAG was thus increasingly marginalised and ignored by the political parties , while any pretences of moderation no longer served a purpose as no further benefits were forthcoming from the government . 
 HIAG then began its drift into the far right , further retreating into its Nazi past . For a time , HIAG published a calendar that marked Nazi commemoration dates . Many of the organisation 's founding members did not evolve with the times . For example , at least through the 1970s , Kumm remained " the ever unreformed Nazi enthusiast " , according to Parker , who was given access to the previously closed HIAG archives . 
 As the West German public 's awareness of the SS atrocities grew in the 1970s and 1980s , the attitudes towards Waffen @-@ SS veterans shifted dramatically . The federal organisation and the local groups were ostracised , with their meetings and commemorations greeted with protests . At the same time , neo @-@ Nazi and nationalist movements found in the Waffen @-@ SS an icon to project their understanding of World War II . 
 During the 1980s , the HIAG celebrations grew so large and bold that they created enormous problems for the organisation 's image , such as when a 1985 meeting turned into a public relations disaster . The press reported on singing of forbidden Nazi songs , clashes with demonstrators and Waffen @-@ SS reenactors ( SS reenacting was illegal in West Germany ) . In an even more damaging development , Stern investigative reporter Gerhard <unk> infiltrated the meeting posing as a war buff . He later published a damning article called " Nazi Family Reunion " containing statements from Waffen @-@ SS veterans that ranged from Holocaust denial to virulently anti @-@ semitic comments and references to happy concentration camp inmates " singing like birds " . 
 In its later history , HIAG was monitored by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution as a far @-@ right organisation . It briefly went off the list of neo @-@ Nazi and extremist groups in 1984 , causing another controversy . 
 = = Dissolution = = 
 Perceived by the West German government to be a Nazi organisation , HIAG was disbanded at the federal level in 1992 . HIAG 's last chairman was Hubert Meyer , who provided access to the previously closed HIAG archives to several researchers , including Parker . Parker used the HIAG materials in his 2014 study of Jochen Peiper . 
 Der Freiwillige was still being published in the 2000s . At some point , Der Freiwillige and the Munin Verlag publishing business had been taken over by Patrick Agte , a right @-@ wing author and publisher . Regional HIAG chapters continued to exist through the 2000s , at least one into the 2010s . These groups worked to maintain momentum through the recruitment of younger generations and through outreach to foreign veterans of the Waffen @-@ SS , aided by the continued publication of Der Freiwillige . " [ Its ] acclaimed aim , today [ 2014 ] , is to link older and younger generations in a common cause , " note the historians Steffen Werther and Madeleine Hurd . The publication 's predominant theme continued to be " Europe against Bolshevism " , with several editorials devoted to the idea that the Waffen @-@ SS laid the foundation for the unification of Europe , expansion of NATO and " freedom of <unk> " , as stated in one of the issues . 
 HIAG 's informal successor was the international War Grave Memorial Foundation " When All Brothers Are Silent " ( <unk> ' Wenn alle <unk> <unk> ' ) , formed with a stated goal of maintaining war graves . In the 1990s and 2000s , after the fall of the Berlin Wall , it worked on arranging new commemorative sites for the Waffen @-@ SS dead in the former Soviet Union , including one in the Ukraine . 
 = = Assessment and legacy = = 
 HIAG never grew to the size of other West German veterans ' organisations , the most successful of which , VdH , had membership approaching 500 @,@ 000 . Diehl , who studied postwar veterans ' movements in West Germany , writes that Der Freiwillige 's " fire @-@ eating editorials " were ignored by the overwhelming majority of Waffen @-@ SS veterans , who were more interested in rebuilding their civilian lives or getting too old to consider returning to military service . HIAG 's membership began to fall sharply in the 1960s , while the organisation itself was never a significant threat to democracy . " HIAG 's main goal was pensions , not a restoration of the Third Reich , " he notes . 
 = = = Performance as lobby group = = = 
 HIAG 's performance as a lobbying organisation was mixed . Large sees a " combination of resentment , myopia and inflated self @-@ importance " in HIAG 's efforts and attitudes . " [ The campaign ] to regain their ' honour ' and exercise political influence ( ... ) was only partially successful " , he writes . He credits West Germany 's government , major political parties and military planners with keeping sufficient distance from HIAG and other veterans ' organisations to limit their role in the new republic and its armed forces . " In that respect , ( ... ) Bonn was not Weimar , " he concludes . 
 On the other hand , as a " crucible of historical revisionism " ( in Picaper 's definition ) , HIAG achieved remarkable success in its rewriting of history . The results are felt to this day in public 's perceptions and popular culture , with many works translated into English . The historians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies write : " Unfortunately , the scholarly writings remained confined to a small audience , whereas the readership of the German authors ( and their English @-@ language spin @-@ offs ) was considerably larger " . The authors note that " with a forty @-@ year head start " , the predominance of the German view , and the related fascination by Waffen @-@ SS romancers , " hardly remains a mystery " . 
 = = = Revisionist tradition outside of HIAG = = = 
 HIAG was instrumental in creating the perception in popular culture of the Waffen @-@ SS being " comrades @-@ in @-@ arms engaged in a noble crusade " ( according to MacKenzie ) . These notions were questioned by West German researches , but German society overall , wanting to forget the past , embraced the image . MacKenzie highlights the long @-@ term effects of HIAG 's revisionism : 
 As older generation of Waffen @-@ SS scribes has died off , a new , post @-@ war cadre of writers has done much to perpetuate the image of the force as a revolutionary European army . The degree of admiration and acceptance varies , but the overall tendency to accentuate the positive lives on , or has indeed grown stronger . 
 The revisionist tradition continues to the present time , through popular history books , web sites and wargames . New titles appear every year , propagating the myths first put forth by HIAG 's propaganda efforts . Some of the books are amateur historical studies that focus solely on the military aspects of the Waffen @-@ SS . Others are reprints of apologetic accounts by former Waffen @-@ SS personnel . Adding to the volume of material are groups of international admirers who consider Waffen @-@ SS to have been incorrectly judged by history . 
 = = = = Popular history = = = = 
 Smelser and Davies contend that some of the better known or prolific authors in the Waffen @-@ SS revisionist tradition include Agte , who wrote hagiographic accounts on Jochen Peiper , Michael Wittmann and other Waffen @-@ SS men , and Franz Kurowski , who provided numerous non @-@ peer reviewed wartime chronicles of Waffen @-@ SS units and highly decorated men . Critics have been dismissive of his works , describing them as <unk> @-@ pulp ( " soldier @-@ pulp " ) literature and " laudatory texts " , that focus on hero @-@ making at the expense of the historical truth . Another popular author , Mark <unk> , published 11 books up to 2008 , mostly through Schiffer Publishing . 
 According to MacKenzie , authors in the revisionist tradition range from " extreme admirers [ on ] the fringes of the far @-@ right " , such as Richard Landwehr and Jean <unk> , to partisan authors ( Gordon Williamson and Edmund L. Blandford ) , and popular historians who generally present the Waffen @-@ SS in a positive light . These include John Keegan , James S. Lucas and Bruce Quarrie . The historian Henning Pieper notes non @-@ scholarly works by Christopher <unk> , Herbert Walther ( writer ) , and Tim Ripley as part of " militaria literature " genre ( in his definition ) , while the military historian Robert <unk> includes books by Willi Fey and Michael Reynolds among uncritical works aimed at " military history buffs " . 
 = = = = Websites , wargames and reenactment = = = = 
 Smelser and Davies argue that the revisionist @-@ inspired messages and visuals found their way into wargames , Internet chatrooms and forums and the popular culture of Waffen @-@ SS " romancers " , that is those who romanticise the German war effort . They contend that the Achtung Panzer and <unk> websites are especially attractive to this group . 
 Popular culture of the romancers also includes Waffen @-@ SS reenactment . Although banned in Germany and Austria , SS reenacting groups thrive elsewhere , including in Europe and North America . In U.S. alone , by the end of the 1990s there were 20 Waffen @-@ SS reenactment groups , out of approximately 40 groups dedicated to German World War II units . In contrast , during that time there were 21 groups dedicated to the American units of the same era . 
 = 2015 Tour de Suisse = 
 The 2015 Tour de Suisse was the 79th edition of the Tour de Suisse stage race . It took place from 13 to 21 June and was the seventeenth race of the 2015 UCI World Tour . It started in Risch @-@ Rotkreuz and finished in Bern . The race was composed of nine stages including two time trials , a short one on the first day and a long one on the last day . The event covered 1 @,@ 258 km ( 782 mi ) and visited Liechtenstein and Austria on its fifth stage . There was only one mountaintop finish , on the aforementioned stage five . 
 The winner of the general classification was Slovenian Simon Špilak of Team Katusha , who won the race by a margin of only five seconds from Great Britain 's Geraint Thomas ( Team Sky ) . The ultimate selection was made on the last day 's individual time trial . Tom Dumoulin of the Giant – Alpecin squad rounded up the podium . The latter won the two individual time trials , on the first and last stage . 
 The mountains classification was awarded to Austria 's Stefan Denifl ( IAM Cycling ) , who featured in many breakaways to amass his points . The sprints classification was won by Slovakian Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) who also was the victor of two stages . Team Sky finished at the head of the team classification with a margin of 11 minutes and 49 seconds . 
 Other riders who won a stage were Croatian Kristijan Đurasek of Lampre – Merida , Australian Michael Matthews ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) , Norwegian Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) and Kazakh Alexey Lutsenko of Astana . Frenchman Thibaut Pinot grabbed the queen stage to the Rettenbach glacier and held the leader 's jersey for four stages , but had to surrender it on the last day of competition to Špilak .

 As a UCI World Tour event , the organisation was in an obligation to invite all seventeen UCI WorldTeams , and likewise , all seventeen teams were obligated to send a squad . To complete the field , two UCI Professional Continental teams were invited to join the race . The number of riders allowed per team was eight , so the starting field contained 152 cyclists . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favorites = = 
 Rui Costa ( Movistar Team ) won the last three editions of the race , however he was not present at the 2015 event , as he raced in the Critérium du Dauphiné instead . More contenders for the overall classification of the Tour de France opted for the latter race since it was more mountainous . There were two former winners of the Tour de Suisse at the starting line , Trek Factory Racing teammates : Swiss Fabian Cancellara and <unk> Fränk Schleck . 
 Contenders for the general classification were Simon Špilak ( Team Katusha ) , Thibaut Pinot ( FDJ ) , <unk> Majka ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , Sergio Henao ( Team Sky ) , Tom Dumoulin ( Giant @-@ Alpecin ) , Michał Kwiatkowski ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) and Geraint Thomas ( Team Sky ) . Other hopefuls were Jurgen Van den Broeck ( Lotto – Soudal ) and Sébastien Reichenbach ( IAM Cycling ) . It was AG2R La Mondiale 's Domenico Pozzovivo 's first race after his disastrous crash in the Giro d 'Italia , so his form was predicted as uncertain , but the Italian climber could certainly be a factor if he was in shape . 
 Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff @-@ Saxo ) was a contender for stage wins . His directeur sportif ( team manager ) said he was the leader of the team and would target the opening prologue . Mark Cavendish of Etixx @-@ Quick Step , who proved his form with twelve stage victories so far in the season , was a favorite for the sprint stages . Other riders contending stage glory were Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) and John Degenkolb ( Giant – Alpecin ) . Cancellara , the 2009 winner , was recovering from a crash suffered at the E3 Harelbeke one @-@ day race ; his primary focus was on his recovery .

 An important race in its own right , the 2015 Tour de Suisse was used by some Tour de France riders to perfect their physical conditions , as the well @-@ known French race started on 4 July . The route for the race was announced on 9 March 2015 . 
 The race did not follow any particular pattern in terms of geographical displacement around the country , but did visit Liechtenstein and Austria on the fifth stage . It was also the longest of the race and may be qualified as the queen stage . It finished near Sölden situated in Austrian territory and featured a mountaintop finish . After that , the race came back in Swiss territory for the remainder of the event . The stages which were likely to be the most important for the general classification were the aforementioned stage five and the individual time trial on the final stage . The race featured a total elevation gain of 15 @,@ 606 m ( 51 @,@ 200 @.@ 8 ft ) . 
 On 4 June 2015 , it was announced that the town of <unk> was <unk> itself from being the start of stage three because of road damage caused by a rocky landslide , and that the town of Quinto would instead be the starting town . This shortened the stage by 57 @.@ 2 km ( 35 @.@ 5 mi ) .

 13 June 2015 — Risch @-@ Rotkreuz to Risch @-@ Rotkreuz 5 @.@ 1 km ( 3 @.@ 2 mi ) 
 The very short prologue contained three sharp corners . The first two kilometers were slightly uphill , the third one was slightly downhill and the rest was flat . 
 The best times coming from the first tier of riders have been Matthias Brändle ( IAM Cycling ) with 5 ' 45 " , Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) a second slower and Cameron Meyer ( Orica @-@ GreenEDGE ) another second in arrears . Thibaut Pinot ( FDJ ) came in with a deficit of twelve seconds on Brändle . Michael Matthews ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) also realized a good time , four seconds down on the provisional leader . Domenico Pozzovivo ( Ag2r @-@ La Mondiale ) came to the finish with a fifteen @-@ second deficit . Daniele Bennati ( Tinkoff @-@ Saxo ) had the best intermediate time all day , which was calculated with 2 @.@ 1 km ( 1 @.@ 3 mi ) remaining as the riders went through the checkpoint . 
 Fabian Cancellara ( Trek Factory Racing ) , beat Brändle with a time of 5 ' 43 " . Time trial specialist Adriano Malori ( Movistar Team ) started soon after Cancellara crossed the finish line , but came in at 5 ' 47 " , four seconds slower . Giant @-@ Alpecin rider Tom Dumoulin clocked 5 ' 41 " , 2 seconds better than Cancellara , and would ultimately be the winner of the stage . 
 BMC Racing Team 's Silvan Dillier crashed as he was on a straight stretch of road . He managed to remount and finish the stage ; his final position was last place , 1 ' 22 " down . Team Sky 's leader Geraint Thomas put in a fast ride , only seven seconds down on the winner . Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) came in five seconds in arrears of Dumoulin , missing out on his objective of being the first leader of the race . Robert Gesink ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) clocked a time 22 seconds slower than Dumoulin , and so did Sergio Henao of Team Sky . Poles Rafał Majka ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) and Michał Kwiatkowski ( Etixx @-@ Quick Step ) were 20 and 21 seconds down respectively . 
 After the event , Dumoulin said that he prepared at altitude for the race and that he produced a hard physical effort on the uphill section and went less intensely on the flatter parts .

 14 June 2015 — Risch @-@ Rotkreuz to Risch @-@ Rotkreuz 161 @.@ 1 km ( 100 @.@ 1 mi ) 
 The stage started right away with a Category 2 climb named <unk> which was 5 @.@ 4 km ( 3 @.@ 4 mi ) long . The riders then rode a loop to tackle the latter climb once more about midway through the stage . Afterward another loop around Risch @-@ Rotkreuz was effectuated to reach a Category 1 affair named Michaelskreuz , 4 km ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) long . The course came back down and effectuated another circuit to tackle the climb a second and last time . This last King of the Mountains ( KOM ) checkpoint was situated at 12 km ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) from the finish . The riders negotiated the descent and ended up once again in Risch @-@ Rotkreuz for the finale . 
 After 38 km ( 23 @.@ 6 mi ) of racing , Luka <unk> ( Lampre @-@ Merida ) , Cameron Meyer ( Orica @-@ GreenEDGE ) , Jurgen Roelandts ( Lotto – Soudal ) and Valerio Agnoli of Astana had an advantage of 1 ' 08 " over chasers Ben King ( Cannondale – Garmin ) and Simone Antonini of Pro Continental team Wanty – Groupe Gobert . They also enjoyed a lead of 2 ' 55 " on the peloton . The two chasers soon fell back into the main field . The maximum gap the peloton allowed the escapees to have was 3 ' 20 " . As the main group attacked the climb of Michaelskreuz for the first time , Arnaud <unk> ( FDJ ) crashed because of the fight for position . 
 With 16 km ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) to go , the riders attacked the climb of Michaelskreuz for the second and last time and caught the remnants of the breakaway on the way up . Astana 's Jakob Fuglsang accelerated close to the summit , with only Geraint Thomas ( Team Sky ) and Simon Špilak ( Team Katusha ) initially able to follow , while Michał Kwiatkowski ( Etixx @-@ Quick Step ) lost contact . Geraint Thomas then attacked on the descent and was followed by Fuglsang and Špilak ( Team Katusha ) . Tom Dumoulin ( Giant @-@ Alpecin ) chased them as he wanted to protect his leader 's jersey . A small group of nine riders formed on the descent . 
 Close to the final kilometer , Kristijan Đurasek of Lampre – Merida placed an acceleration and continued to a solo victory on the flat run @-@ in . The group came in four seconds in arrears , with Daniel Moreno ( Team Katusha ) winning the sprint for second place before Arredondo . Overall contenders Thibaut Pinot ( FDJ ) and Simon Špilak ) were also part of that clique , coming in fourth and sixth respectively . Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff @-@ Saxo ) won the sprint of the following group , coming in tenth at fourteen seconds . Dumoulin kept his leader 's jersey . <unk> amassed enough mountain points ( 18 ) to earn the mountains classification jersey .

 15 June 2015 — Quinto to <unk> 117 @.@ 3 km ( 72 @.@ 9 mi ) 
 This was the new version of the stage as the original route was closed due to a landslide . The stage immediately started the 1 @,@ 087 m ( 3 @,@ 566 @.@ 3 ft ) -high ascent of the Hors Category Gotthard Pass , which summit was 18 @.@ 8 km ( 11 @.@ 7 mi ) in . Then came a long false flat until a Category 2 climb , the 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) -long Zona <unk> . It was immediately followed by a Category 3 named ascent Via <unk> , which summited 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) from the finish . The climb was 3 @.@ 2 km ( 2 @.@ 0 mi ) . 
 The race got on its way under cloudy but dry conditions . The Tour de Suisse was featuring the Gotthard Pass for the 34th time in its history , and a break formed along its early slopes , which featured cobbles . The two attackers were Stefan Denifl ( IAM Cycling ) and Marco Marcato ( Wanty @-@ Groupe Gobert ) . The pair had a lead of 2 ' 30 " on the main field as <unk> <unk> ( CCC @-@ Sprandi @-@ Polkowice ) was chasing them . Denifl got to the top of the climb first to rake in twenty points . By the top of the pass , snow was covering the sides of the road and the field was 3 ' 20 " back . The riders put <unk> on before the descent , which lasted almost 40 km ( 24 @.@ 9 mi ) . <unk> succeeded in joining the escape during the downhill . 
 The competitors replenished their food stock at the feed zone situated shortly after the downhill section . The main field started accelerating , with the team of the leader Tom Dumoulin Giant @-@ Alpecin doing most of the work at the front . Realizing this breakaway was gaining ground , Tinkoff @-@ Saxo came to the fore to help , resulting in the gap going down gradually . There was 30 km ( 18 @.@ 6 mi ) to cover as the gap was hovering around 4 ' 30 " . 
 At the foot of the Zona <unk> climb , with 19 km ( 11 @.@ 8 mi ) remaining , the gap had shrunk significantly . The peloton formed sprint trains to better position their leaders for the ascent . Marcato was soon dropped from the breakaway and Denifl won the mountain points . At that point , Denifl and <unk> had only a thirty seconds gap over the depleting field . The catch was effectuated with 8 @.@ 7 km ( 5 @.@ 4 mi ) to race . Michael Albasini ( Orica @-@ GreenEDGE ) attacked , soon followed by Jan Bakelants ( Ag2r @-@ La Mondiale ) . With the two escapees enjoying only a ten @-@ second advantage , Sergio Henao ( Team Sky ) accelerated and passed them . The trio was ultimately reeled in . Rafał Majka ( Tinkoff @-@ Saxo ) was working at the front of the small leading group to bring back the attackers to give his team leader Peter Sagan a chance at victory . In the last few kilometers , Sagan took over from Majka himself . He followed Daniel Moreno ( Team Katusha ) , who had chased down Esteban Chaves ( Orica @-@ GreenEDGE ) , passing him to take victory .

 The first 60 km ( 37 @.@ 3 mi ) were flat until the peloton reached Wildhaus Pass , a Category 2 test of 8 @.@ 9 km ( 5 @.@ 5 mi ) . Then there were three Category 3 climbs on offer , which were the 1 @.@ 8 km ( 1 @.@ 1 mi ) -long Kirchberg climb repeated three times as the riders accomplished a loop . There were however a number of uncategorized rises , especially one with about 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) to cover , that could play a role in the outcome . The finishing 900 m ( 2 @,@ 952 @.@ 8 ft ) were straight with a consistent incline . 
 Davide Malacarne ( Astana ) and Thomas De Gendt ( Lotto – Soudal ) attacked early in the stage . They were joined by a trio of Stijn Devolder ( Trek Factory Racing ) , Alex Howes ( Cannondale – Garmin ) and Frederik <unk> ( Wanty @-@ Groupe Gobert ) . De Gendt crested the Wildhaus Pass first to take eight points in the KOM competition . At the summit , after 66 km ( 41 @.@ 0 mi ) of racing , the gap between the peloton and the breakers was two minutes and fifty seconds . 
 De Gendt took maximum points atop the Kirchberg climb on the riders ' first passage . The main field got through the KOM line 2 ' 05 " in arrears . The descent was fast and the riders crossed the finish line for the first time of three with about 60 km ( 37 @.@ 3 mi ) to race . The breakaway was caught less than 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) later . Orica @-@ GreenEDGE marshaled the field as De Gendt attacked again to no avail as he was swiftly swept back . Sprint specialists Arnaud <unk> ( FDJ ) , Mark Cavendish ( Etixx @-@ Quick Step ) and Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) struggled with the high pace at the front set by Orica – GreenEDGE . As the peloton crossed the line for the last time with 29 @.@ 2 km ( 18 @.@ 1 mi ) to race , there were no escapees . 
 The last KOM of the day atop the Kirchberg climb was won by Daryl Impey ; it was uncontested and he won because he was riding at the front . Alexey Lutsenko ( Astana ) placed an attack with 16 km ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) to go . With 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) to race he had opened up an advantage of 20 seconds . With 6 @.@ 7 km ( 4 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining , Lutsenko was caught . An attack formed immediately including the riders Marco Marcato ( Wanty @-@ Groupe Gobert ) , Jan Bakelants ( Ag2r @-@ La Mondiale ) and Sergio Henao ( Team Sky ) ; it failed and they were brought back as ( Wanty @-@ Groupe Gobert and ( Orica @-@ GreenEDGE teams worked together to set up a sprint finish . With 300 m ( 984 @.@ 3 ft ) to go , Sagan initiated his sprint first and was followed by Michael Matthews of Orica – GreenEDGE . Matthews then passed him to claim his first victory at the Tour de Suisse . Sagan took second place and the points classification jersey .

 17 June 2015 — <unk> to Sölden ( Austria ) 237 @.@ 3 km ( 147 @.@ 5 mi ) 
 This was the queen stage of the 2015 Tour de Suisse and was also the longest stage the race featured in the last twenty years . The first difficulty of the day was the 34 @.@ 4 km ( 21 @.@ 4 mi ) long Hors Category <unk> Pass which summits at 2 @,@ 071 m ( 6 @,@ 794 @.@ 6 ft ) of altitude and at that point , the riders were already in Austria after a brief visit to Liechtenstein .

The competitors rode the <unk> Glacier Road from Sölden to get to the finish line . 
 The overall race leader Tom Dumoulin ( Giant @-@ Alpecin ) said before the stage that if he lost less than one minute and a half to the pure climbers , he could still win the Tour by taking that time back on the final stage 's time trial . The previous stage 's victor Michael Matthews ( Orica @-@ GreenEDGE ) was a non @-@ starter , saying he had gotten what he wanted from the race : a stage win . A breakaway formed in the opening 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) of the race . They were Gregory Rast ( Trek Factory Racing ) , KOM jersey wearer Stefan Denifl and his teammate Matthias Brändle ( IAM Cycling ) , Ben King ( Cannondale – Garmin ) , Przemysław Niemiec ( Lampre @-@ Merida ) , Stefan Schumacher ( CCC @-@ Sprandi @-@ Polkowice ) , Thomas De Gendt ( Lotto – Soudal ) and Mirko <unk> ( Wanty @-@ Groupe Gobert ) . The best @-@ placed cyclist in the break on the general classification was <unk> in 59th place , 18 ' 38 " down on Dumoulin . Denifl amassed maximum points atop the <unk> Pass , comforting his lead in the mountains classification . Jon Izagirre of the Movistar Team abandoned after the pass . 
 With 90 km ( 55 @.@ 9 mi ) to go the gap was miscalculated by the race organizers as there were unrealistic fluctuations in the official timing throughout the long stretch of flat road before the final climb . With 82 km ( 51 @.@ 0 mi ) to cover , Astana took control of the peloton for their leader Jakob Fuglsang . FDJ and Team Katusha started helping the chase at the front , since those teams had riders aiming for victory ( Thibaut Pinot and the Daniel Moreno @-@ Simon Špilak duo , respectively ) . With 30 km ( 18 @.@ 6 mi ) to the start of the big final climb , the gap was around six and a half minutes . The break fractured , just as the peloton did later when they hit the Rettenbach ascent . Dumoulin was dropped almost at the beginning of it but resisted , climbing at his own pace . Špilak attacked with 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) remaining and dangled in front of a select group . 
 Early breaker Denifl was alone in front and had about two minutes of an advantage with 4 km ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) to go . Behind , Domenico Pozzovivo placed an acceleration that put the lead group in difficulty , but he was brought back . The time gap rapidly decreased , due to dubious time monitoring again . Pinot launched an attack from the group , but Špilak had the resources to keep up with him for a while but was ultimately dropped . Pinot passed the passive Denifl before the arch signaling the last kilometer ( flamme rouge ) and took a solo victory . Pozzovivo finished second while Špilak settled for third . However , it became soon apparent that Dumoulin would not lose much more than the minute and a half that was his objective . He passed the line 1 ' 37 " down on Pinot . " I 'm very happy , it was important for me and the team . We came here to win a stage , and I had good legs today . I 've got a lot of confidence now , that ’ s important for the Tour de France . And it 's true , racing in Switzerland seems to suit me , " said Pinot . " The objective is to win overall here , but the <unk> like [ Geraint ] Thomas and [ Tom ] Dumoulin aren 't far back , " he added . " It 'll be a long and difficult time trial [ on stage nine ] . We 'll see what happens on the day . "

 18 June 2015 — Wil to Biel 193 @.@ 1 km ( 120 @.@ 0 mi ) 
 This stage contained only one categorized ascent midway through it and was a Category 3 affair named <unk> . However , there were numerous uncategorized rises on the course to Biel and the total elevation gain for the stage was 1 @,@ 167 m ( 3 @,@ 828 @.@ 7 ft ) . Two intermediate sprints came before the run into town in the final 40 km ( 24 @.@ 9 mi ) . 
 As the stage started , there were 145 riders remaining in the race , as only seven entrants had abandoned since the start of the race . The day 's breakers were Axel Domont ( Ag2r @-@ La Mondiale ) , Marek <unk> ( CCC @-@ Sprandi @-@ Polkowice ) , Matej <unk> ( Cannondale – Garmin ) and Jérôme Baugnies ( Wanty @-@ Groupe Gobert ) . The riders soon tackled the <unk> , one of the many uncategorized ascents of the day . With 136 km ( 84 @.@ 5 mi ) left , the breakaway 's advantage stood at 4 ' 30 " . The breakers took the points on offer on the only climb of the day , <unk> , so Stefan Denifl of IAM Cycling needed not worry about someone taking his mountains classification jersey , as he had 63 points with 30 points of an advantage over his nearest competitor Thomas De Gendt ( Lotto – Soudal ) . <unk> won the KOM and amassed the five points that came with it . About midway through , it was calculated that the stage 's average speed was slower than the slowest prediction by the organizers , most likely due to the severity of the previous stage . 
 With 65 km ( 40 @.@ 4 mi ) to cover , rain began to fall ; the main field was led by FDJ , Etixx @-@ Quick Step , Giant @-@ Alpecin and Team Katusha . Baugnies rode first across an uncontested intermediate sprint with 42 @.@ 7 km ( 26 @.@ 5 mi ) to go . 25 km ( 15 @.@ 5 mi ) from the finish , Adriano Malori and Francisco Ventoso of Movistar Team surprised the peloton by attacking . At the 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining arch , the break of four still held a lead of forty seconds with the two Movistar Team riders placed between the groups . Etixx – Quick @-@ Step took matters in their own hands and began forming their sprint train for Mark Cavendish . Tinkoff @-@ Saxo moved to the front in support of their sprint hopeful , Peter Sagan . With 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) to cover , the escape had 30 seconds of an advantage . At that point , two Etixx – Quick @-@ Step riders ( Julien <unk> and Zdenek <unk> ) crashed on the water @-@ logged tarmac before a bend , but the mishap had no consequences on the peloton . The breakers were brought back just before the flamme rouge . 
 Shortly thereafter , Cavendish lost the wheel of his lead @-@ out man Mark Renshaw after struggling to come back after the crash which hindered his lead @-@ out train . There were two technical turns before the finish line . Peter Sagan was sitting in third wheel of his team 's train ; he negotiated the final 90 degree corner with 200 m to go and profited from an unintentional lead @-@ out by Jurgen Roelandts ( Lotto – Soudal ) , who had opened his sprint before Sagan <unk> him in the last hundred meters to win the day . It was Sagan 's eleventh victory in Tour de Suisse history , equaling the records of Hugo <unk> and <unk> Kubler . Because of a split in the peloton , Pinot lost five seconds to general classification rival Geraint Thomas of Team Sky .

 19 June 2015 — Biel to <unk> 160 km ( 99 @.@ 4 mi ) 
 Stage 7 was a flat stage except for three Category 3 climbs in the second half of the stage . The opening 60 km ( 37 @.@ 3 mi ) were totally flat . After 91 km ( 56 @.@ 5 mi ) , the riders tackled the finishing circuit twice . During that circuit , the first climb was the 1 @.@ 1 km ( 0 @.@ 7 mi ) -long <unk> . There was a descent , then the <unk> climb was covered . During the second circuit , the <unk> was attacked again . This last difficulty was situated 19 km ( 11 @.@ 8 mi ) from the finish line . The final 800 m ( 2 @,@ 624 @.@ 7 ft ) were steep . 
 World road race champion Michał Kwiatkowski of the Etixx @-@ Quick Step squad made attempts at escaping before the peloton finally let him go 20 km ( 12 @.@ 4 mi ) in to the race . He was joined by Silvan Dillier ( BMC Racing Team ) , Daryl Impey ( Orica @-@ GreenEDGE ) and Axel Domont ( Ag2r @-@ La Mondiale ) . After the break was resolved , the peloton was content in letting the gap increase to 3 ' 15 " with 129 km ( 80 @.@ 2 mi ) of racing remaining . The best placed rider in this quartet was Impey , 29 ' 18 " down on race leader Thibaut Pinot ( FDJ ) . The average speed of the first hour was 47 @.@ 7 km / h ( 29 @.@ 6 mph ) . Tinkoff @-@ Saxo and Giant @-@ Alpecin dictated the pace , pulling back thirty seconds . With 88 km ( 54 @.@ 7 mi ) to go , the race passed through the village of Misery @-@ <unk> , at which point the gap stood at 2 ' 50 " . A crash occurred in the outskirts of Misery @-@ <unk> , involving Ben Hermans and Manuel <unk> ( both with BMC Racing Team ) . They were able to remount their bikes and rejoined the main field . 
 Wanty @-@ Groupe Gobert 's Enrico Gasparotto abandoned two hours into the stage , which were contested at the speed of 44 km / h ( 27 @.@ 3 mph ) . With 55 km ( 34 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining , the escape had a minute lead . Domont took the maximum points atop the first KOM of the day . As they crossed the line for the last time with 37 km ( 23 @.@ 0 mi ) to go , the breakers were resisting as the time difference was still around a minute . On the second lap of the finishing circuit , Domont was dropped from the breakaway and adsorbed in to the peloton . The now three @-@ rider break had a thirty @-@ second advantage with 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining . Team Katusha controlled the front of the field in the final kilometers . With 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) to go , the peloton almost pulled back the all unyielding breakers , Kwiatkowski decided to go alone . He was caught in sight of the finish line . The uphill sprint was won by Alexander Kristoff of Team Katusha , with Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff @-@ Saxo ) being a close second . Sagan got out of Kristoff 's slipstream to try to out @-@ sprint him in the final meters , but to no avail . This was Kristoff 's eighteenth victory of the season . Through bad positioning , Pinot lost a further five seconds to Geraint Thomas ( Team Sky ) in the overall classification . " It was a hard day , I haven 't felt super in this Tour de Suisse but I did a good sprint today , " said the winner . " I got ahead of Sagan and I was able to go again at the end to hold off his run . "

 20 June 2015 — Bern to Bern 152 @.@ 5 km ( 94 @.@ 8 mi ) 
 The stage was ridden in and around Bern , the first time the Tour de Suisse came to the national capital since 2009 . This was another stage which featured a lot of uncategorized rises . It however contained four Category 3 ascents . The event featured four circuits of 38 @.@ 7 km ( 24 @.@ 0 mi ) around town , on the same course that will be used in the stage nine 's time trial . The two climbs present in the loops gave KOM points on the last two laps only . The riders first took on the 800 m ( 2 @,@ 624 @.@ 7 ft ) -long Category 3 <unk> . It was the 400 m ( 1 @,@ 312 @.@ 3 ft ) -long <unk> climb . The stage finished on the flat , a plateau after the latter ascent , which a number of technical turns . 
 A breakaway of twelve formed at the very start , but was deemed too dangerous and quickly reabsorbed . Citing back problems , Trek Factory Racing rider Jasper Stuyven abandoned the race . The attackers continued to try to form a break and Michał Kwiatkowski 's ( Etixx @-@ Quick Step ) move finally made it . A break of nineteen riders emerged , containing among others Warren Barguil ( Giant @-@ Alpecin ) , the best placed rider of the move on general classification at 4 ' 52 " . Team Sky , Cannondale – Garmin and FDJ led the chase . Despite the main field 's effort , the gap grew to two minutes with 87 km ( 54 @.@ 1 mi ) to cover . 
 With 75 km ( 46 @.@ 6 mi ) to go in the stage , the gap stood at 2 ' 12 " . However , Team Sky , Cannondale – Garmin and FDJ were still working to keep the escapees in range . The time difference to the escape was remaining stationary with around two minutes at the 40 km ( 24 @.@ 9 mi ) to go marker . As the peloton passed through the finish line to undertake the last lap of the circuit , Jakob Fuglsang of Astana abandoned the race . He confirmed later he quit the race due to stomach problems . The peloton was forming a long single line as the pace was high . Maxime Monfort ( Lotto – Soudal ) crashed and abandoned , bruising on his shoulder and back . 
 With 20 km ( 12 @.@ 4 mi ) remaining , Astana 's Alexey Lutsenko attacked the escapees , followed by Jan Bakelants ( Ag2r @-@ La Mondiale ) ; they opened a gap , holding off their former breakaway companions . <unk> lead for the last few kilometers except under the flamme rouge and Lutsenko outsprinted him to claim the victory . He described the win as the biggest of his career . The main field arrived in small groups , with the first one containing Team Sky 's Geraint Thomas and Tom Dumoulin of Giant – Alpecin , who made a marginal time gain of three seconds on Thibaut Pinot . The latter remained in the leaders ' jersey . 
 = = = Stage 9 = = = 
 21 June 2015 — Bern to Bern 38 @.@ 4 km ( 23 @.@ 9 mi ) 
 The lengthy individual time trial featured a climb in the middle of it , but no KOM points were on offer . The course was technical and featured several turnarounds . It was the same course that was raced four times in stage eight , except that the finish line was not situated at the same place . Midway through the stage , the riders took on the difficulty of the day , the 800 m ( 2 @,@ 624 @.@ 7 ft ) -long <unk> . There were other small climbs to pepper the course . 
 The final general classification of the race would definitely be decided on this stage , and a majority of the observers believed that Pinot would lose his lead since he is not a great time trialist , meaning he is not at his best when fighting against the wind on rolling terrain . Geraint Thomas of Team Sky was only 34 seconds down coming into the stage and was among the favorites to take the overall victory . Tom Dumoulin ( Giant @-@ Alpecin ) won the short prologue and was a contender for overall victory too since he is a time trial specialist , but he had 1 ' 24 " to make up for . Another contender for overall win was Simon Špilak of Team Katusha ( 47 seconds down ) . Fourth @-@ placed Domenico Pozzovivo ( Ag2r @-@ La Mondiale ) was an enigma , as he had mixed performances in time trials throughout his career . As far as the stage win in itself was concerned , solo effort specialists Fabian Cancellara ( Trek Factory Racing ) and Adriano Malori ( Movistar Team ) were to be considered , but they had no chance of a victory in the general classification since they were too far down in the rankings . 
 It is to be noted that the riders started in reverse order of the general classification , so Pinot was the last one to start . The riders went off the starting ramp in two minutes increments . Cancellara got on course early , as he was the seventh man to start . He clocked a time of 48 ' 55 " , which would stay a reference for most of the day . He was followed out of the starting area by Matthias Brändle ( IAM Cycling ) who came in 2 ' 28 " after Cancellara , somewhat surprisingly as he is a time trial specialist too . Malori set the best time at the 21 km ( 13 @.@ 0 mi ) intermediate point but faded a little bit in the end , coming to the finish line only 15 seconds off Cancellara 's time . The Swiss would stay as a reference for a while now that some time trial specialists had finished their effort and failed to beat him . Damien Gaudin ( Ag2r @-@ La Mondiale ) clocked in a time of 50 ' 46 " which put him in sixth position . 
 Cameron Meyer ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) put in a time of 49 ' 43 " , 48 seconds off Cancellara 's mark . Around that time , general classification hopeful Dumoulin hopped off the starting ramp . Swiss Silvan Dillier ( BMC Racing Team ) provisionally slotted into sixth position with a time of 50 ' 19 " and minutes later , race leader Pinot got off the starting ramp . Jerome Coppel ( IAM Cycling ) crossed the finish line with a rapid time , only 25 seconds off Cancellara 's performance . Meanwhile , in early time splits , Pinot had already lost twelve seconds to Thomas . Last day 's stage winner Alexey Lutsenko of Astana confirmed his good form with a time of 50 ' 32 " . 
 At the 21 km ( 13 @.@ 0 mi ) marker , Dumoulin beat Malori 's best time by eleven seconds . Špilak was also doing a fast time trial , being equal to the best time at the 15 @.@ 5 km ( 9 @.@ 6 mi ) mark and passing the 21 km ( 13 @.@ 0 mi ) arch faster than Dumoulin by four tenths of a second . By that time , Pinot had virtually lost his lead . Dumoulin took a very focused corner and he almost slammed into spectators upon exiting it , but no accident occurred . Špilak needed fourteen seconds over Thomas to get in front of him in the general classification . Dumoulin came in with a time nineteen seconds better than Cancellara 's and won the stage with an average speed of 47 @.@ 407 km / h ( 29 @.@ 5 mph ) . Špilak came in with a time of 48 ' 54 " and Thomas registered 49 ' 12 " , a difference of 18 seconds . Therefore , Špilak was declared the official winner of the 2015 Tour de Suisse by five seconds . 
 " I ’ m really happy and want to thank my teammates who helped me too much during the race . This is the biggest win of my career so far , " <unk> said . " The time trial was really hard but I liked it . It was up and down all the way and that helped me . I gave it everything . " It was the Slovenian 's tenth victory in the professional ranks . 
 = = Classification leadership = = 
 In the 2015 Tour de Suisse , three different jerseys were awarded . For the general classification , calculated by adding each cyclist 's finishing times on each stage , and the leader received a yellow jersey . This classification was considered the most important of the Tour de Suisse , and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race . There was also a mountains classification , the leadership of which was marked by a light blue jersey . In the mountains classification , points were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists , with more points available for the higher @-@ categorised climbs . Hors Category gave 20 points to the first rider crossing ( 20 , 15 , 10 , 6 , 4 ) , a Category 1 was worth 12 points ( 12 , 8 , 6 , 4 , 2 ) , a Category 2 was worth 8 points ( 8 , 6 , 4 , 2 , 1 ) and a Category 3 was worth 5 points ( 5 , 3 , 2 , 1 ) . 
 The third jersey represented the points classification , marked by a white @-@ and @-@ red jersey . In the points classification , cyclists got points for finishing highly in a stage . A stage victory awarded 10 points , with 8 points for second , 6 for third , 4 for fourth and 2 for fifth . Points could also be earned at intermediate sprints location for finishing in the top three during each stage on a 6 – 3 – 1 scale . There was also a classification for teams , in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together ; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time . 
 A combativity award was also attributed for the rider who had ridden the most aggressively in the eyes of the judges at the end of every stage . It could have been a rider who featured in breakaways or a cyclist who attacked often .

 = Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūjō = 
 Ryūjō ( Japanese : <unk> " <unk> Dragon " ) was a light aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during the early 1930s . Small and lightly built in an attempt to exploit a loophole in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 , she proved to be top @-@ heavy and only marginally stable and was back in the shipyard for modifications to address those issues within a year of completion . With her stability improved , Ryūjō returned to service and was employed in operations during the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War . During World War II , she provided air support for operations in the Philippines , Malaya , and the Dutch East Indies , where her aircraft participated in the Second Battle of the Java Sea . During the Indian Ocean raid in April 1942 , the carrier attacked British merchant shipping with both her guns and her aircraft . Ryūjō next participated in the Battle of the Aleutian Islands in June . She was sunk by American carrier aircraft at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August 1942 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Ryūjō was planned as a light carrier of around 8 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 7 @,@ 900 long tons ) standard displacement to exploit a loophole in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 that carriers under 10 @,@ 000 long tons ( 10 @,@ 000 t ) standard displacement were not regarded as " aircraft carriers " . While Ryūjō was under construction , Article Three of the London Naval Treaty of 1930 closed the above @-@ mentioned loophole ; consequently , Ryūjō was the only light aircraft carrier of her type to be completed by Japan . 
 Ryūjō had a length of 179 @.@ 9 meters ( 590 ft 3 in ) overall . She had a beam of 20 @.@ 32 meters ( 66 ft 8 in ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 56 meters ( 18 ft 3 in ) . She displaced 8 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 7 @,@ 900 long tons ) at standard load and 10 @,@ 150 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 990 long tons ) at normal load . Her crew consisted of 600 officers and enlisted men . 
 To keep Ryūjō 's weight to 8 @,@ 000 metric tons , her hull was lightly built and no armor could be provided , although some protective plating was added abreast the machinery spaces and magazines . She was also designed with only a single hangar , which would have left her with an extremely low profile ( there being just 4 @.@ 6 meters ( 15 ft 1 in ) of freeboard amidships and 3 @.@ 0 meters ( 9 ft 10 in ) aft ) . Between the time the carrier was laid down in 1929 and launched in 1931 , however , the Navy doubled her aircraft stowage requirement to 48 in order to give her a more capable air group . This necessitated the addition of a second hangar atop the first , raising freeboard to 14 @.@ 9 meters ( 48 ft 11 in ) . Coupled with the ship 's narrow beam , the consequent top @-@ heaviness made her minimally stable in rough seas , despite the fitting of Sperry active stabilizers . This was a common flaw amongst many treaty @-@ circumventing Japanese warships of her generation . 
 The Tomozuru Incident of 12 March 1934 , in which a top @-@ heavy torpedo boat capsized in heavy weather , caused the IJN to investigate the stability of all their ships , resulting in a number of design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength . Ryūjō , already known to be only marginally stable , was promptly docked at the Kure Naval Arsenal for modifications that strengthened her keel and added ballast and shallow torpedo bulges to improve her stability . Her funnels were moved higher up the side of her hull and curved downward to keep the deck clear of smoke . 
 Shortly afterward , Ryūjō was one of many Japanese warships caught in a typhoon on 25 September 1935 while on maneuvers during the " Fourth Fleet Incident . " The ship 's bridge , flight deck and superstructure were damaged and her hangar was flooded . Her forecastle was raised one deck and her bow was remodeled with more flare to make her less wet forward . After these modifications , her beam and draft increased to 20 @.@ 78 meters ( 68 ft 2 in ) and 7 @.@ 08 meters ( 23 ft 3 in ) respectively . Her displacement also increased to 10 @,@ 600 metric tons ( 10 @,@ 400 long tons ) at standard load and 12 @,@ 732 metric tons ( 12 @,@ 531 long tons ) at normal load . Her crew also grew to 924 officers and enlisted men . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 The ship was fitted with two geared steam turbine sets with a total of 65 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 48 @,@ 000 kW ) , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam provided by six Kampon water @-@ tube boilers . Ryūjō had a designed speed of 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) , but reached 29 @.@ 5 knots ( 54 @.@ 6 km / h ; 33 @.@ 9 mph ) during her sea trials from 65 @,@ 270 shp ( 48 @,@ 670 kW ) . The ship carried 2 @,@ 490 long tons ( 2 @,@ 530 t ) of fuel oil , which gave her a range of 10 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 19 @,@ 000 km ; 12 @,@ 000 mi ) at 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . The boiler uptakes were trunked to the ship 's starboard side amidships and exhausted horizontally below flight deck level through two small funnels . 
 = = = Flight deck and hangars = = = 
 Ryūjō was a flush @-@ decked carrier without an island superstructure ; her navigating and control bridge was located just under the forward lip of the flight deck in a long glassed @-@ in " greenhouse " . Her superstructure was set back 23 @.@ 5 meters ( 77 ft 1 in ) from the ship 's stem , giving Ryūjō a distinctive open bow . Her 156 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 513 ft 5 in ) flight deck was 23 meters ( 75 ft 6 in ) wide and extended well beyond the aft end of her superstructure , supported by a pair of pillars . Six transverse arrestor wires were installed on the flight deck and were later modernized in 1936 to stop a 6 @,@ 000 kg ( 13 @,@ 000 lb ) aircraft . The ship 's hangars were both 102 @.@ 4 meters ( 335 ft 11 in ) long and 18 @.@ 9 meters ( 62 ft 0 in ) wide , and had an approximate area of 3 @,@ 871 square metres ( 41 @,@ 667 sq ft ) . Between them , they gave the ship the capacity to store 48 aircraft , although only 37 could be operated at one time . After the Fourth Fleet Incident , Ryūjō 's bridge and the leading edge of the flight deck were rounded off to make them more streamlined . This reduced the length of the flight deck by 2 meters ( 6 ft 7 in ) . 
 Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by two elevators ; the forward platform measured 15 @.@ 7 by 11 @.@ 1 meters ( 51 @.@ 5 ft × 36 @.@ 4 ft ) and the rear 10 @.@ 8 by 8 @.@ 0 meters ( 35 @.@ 4 ft × 26 @.@ 2 ft ) . The small rear elevator became a problem as the IJN progressively fielded larger and more modern carrier aircraft . Of all the aircraft in front @-@ line service in 1941 , only the Nakajima B5N " Kate " torpedo bomber would fit , when positioned at an angle with its wings folded . This effectively made Ryūjō a single @-@ elevator carrier and considerably hindered transfer of aircraft in and out of the hangars for rearming and refueling during combat operations . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 As completed , Ryūjō 's primary anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) armament comprised six twin @-@ gun mounts equipped with 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 @-@ centimeter Type 89 dual @-@ purpose guns mounted on projecting sponsons , three on either side of the carrier 's hull . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 meters ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; they had a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 440 meters ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . Twenty @-@ four anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) Type 93 13 @.@ 2 mm Hotchkiss machine guns were also fitted , in twin and quadruple mounts . Their effective range against aircraft was 700 – 1 @,@ 500 meters ( 770 – 1 @,@ 640 yd ) . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute , but the need to change 30 @-@ round magazines reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute . 
 During the carrier 's 1934 – 36 refit , two of the 12 @.@ 7 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) mountings were exchanged for two twin @-@ gun mounts for license @-@ built Hotchkiss 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns , resulting in a savings of approximately 60 long tons ( 61 t ) of top @-@ weight that improved the ship 's overall stability . This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . According to historian Mark Stille , the weapon had many faults including an inability to " handle high @-@ speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power , its sights were inadequate for high @-@ speed targets , [ and ] it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast " . These 25 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) guns had an effective range of 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 1 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 300 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 meters ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) at an elevation of + 85 degrees . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . The machine @-@ guns were replaced during a brief refit in April – May 1942 with six triple @-@ mount 25 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) AA guns .

 Following the Japanese ship @-@ naming conventions for aircraft carriers , Ryūjō was named " Dragon Horse " . The ship was laid down at the Mitsubishi 's Yokohama shipyard on 26 November 1929 . She was launched on 2 April 1931 , towed to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 25 April for fitting out , and commissioned on 9 May 1933 with Captain Toshio Matsunaga in command . While training in mid @-@ 1933 , her initial air group consisted of nine Mitsubishi <unk> ( Type 13 ) torpedo bombers , plus three spares , and three <unk> ( Type 3 ) fighters , plus two spares . Matsunaga was relieved by Captain Torao <unk> on 20 October . After the Tomozuru Incident , the ship was reconstructed from 26 May to 20 August 1934 . 
 Captain Ichiro Ono assumed command on 15 November 1934 and Ryūjō became the flagship of Rear Admiral <unk> Wada 's First Carrier Division . The following month the ship was chosen to evaluate dive @-@ bombing tactics using six Nakajima E4N2 @-@ C Type 90 reconnaissance aircraft , six Yokosuka <unk> Type 92 torpedo bombers , and a dozen <unk> Type 90 fighters . The reconnaissance aircraft proved to be unsuitable after several months ' testing . Ryūjō participated in the Combined Fleet Maneuvers of 1935 where she was attached to the IJN Fourth Fleet . The fleet was caught in a typhoon on 25 September and the ship was moderately damaged . Ryūjō arrived at Kure on 11 October 1935 for repairs , modifications , and a refit that lasted until 31 May 1936 . On 31 October Ono was relieved by Captain Shun 'ichi Kira . 
 In mid @-@ 1936 , the ship was used to evaluate a dozen Aichi D1A dive bombers and dive @-@ bombing tactics . She also embarked at that time 24 A4N1 fighters , plus four and eight spare aircraft respectively . In September , Ryūjō resumed her role as flagship of First Carrier Division , now commanded by Rear Admiral Saburō Satō . Her air group now consisted of a mixture of <unk> torpedo bombers , <unk> dive bombers and A2N fighters , but her torpedo bombers were transferred after fleet maneuvers in October demonstrated effective dive bombing tactics . Captain Katsuo Abe assumed command of the ship on 16 November . 
 The First Carrier Division arrived off Shanghai on 13 August 1937 to support operations of the Japanese Army in China . Her aircraft complement consisted of 12 A4N fighters ( plus four spares ) and 15 D1A dive bombers . The dive bombers attacked targets in and near Shanghai . The Japanese fighters had their first aerial engagement on 22 August when four A4Ns surprised 18 Nationalist Curtiss Hawk III fighters and claimed to have shot down six without loss . The following day , four A4Ns claimed to have shot down nine Chinese fighters without loss to themselves . The carriers returned to Sasebo at the beginning of September to resupply before arriving off the South China coast on 21 September to attack Chinese forces near Canton . Nine fighters from Ryūjō escorted a raid on the city and claimed six of the defending fighters . While escorting another raid later that same day , the Japanese pilots claimed five aircraft shot down and one probably shot down . The dive bombers attacked targets near Canton until the ship sailed to the Shanghai area on 3 October . Her air group was flown ashore on 6 October to support Japanese forces near Shanghai and Nanking . Ryūjō returned home in November and briefly became a training ship before she was assigned to Rear Admiral <unk> <unk> 's Second Carrier Division . 
 In February 1938 the ship replaced her A4N biplanes with nine Mitsubishi A5M " Claude " monoplane fighters . The division supported Japanese operations in Southern China in March – April and again in October . Captain Kiichi Hasegawa assumed command on 15 November 1939 . Ryūjō was given a refit that lasted from December 1939 through January 1940 and became a training ship until November when she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta 's Third Carrier Division . Hasegawa was relieved by Captain <unk> Sugimoto on 21 June . The ship 's air group then consisted of 18 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and 16 <unk> fighters . When the First Air Fleet was formed on 10 April 1941 , Ryūjō became flagship of Fourth Carrier Division .

 The ship 's assignment at the beginning of the Pacific War was to support the invasion of the Philippines , initially by attacking the American naval base at Davao , Mindanao on the morning of 8 December . Her air group had not changed , but four of each type of aircraft were spares . Ryūjō 's initial airstrike consisted of 13 B5Ns escorted by nine A5Ms with a smaller , follow @-@ on airstrike later in the day by two B5Ns and three A5Ms . They accomplished little , destroying two Consolidated PBY seaplanes on the ground for the loss of one B5N and A5M . The ship covered the landing at Davao on 20 December and her B5Ns attacked a British oil tanker south of Davao . In January 1942 her aircraft supported Japanese operations in the Malay Peninsula . 
 In mid @-@ February 1942 , Ryūjō 's aircraft attacked ships evacuating from Singapore , claiming eight ships damaged , three burnt , and four sunk . They also covered convoys carrying troops to Sumatra . The ship was unsuccessfully attacked by several Bristol Blenheim light bombers of No. 84 Squadron RAF on 14 February . The following day two waves of B5Ns , totaling 13 aircraft , attacked the British heavy cruiser Exeter , but only managed to damage the ship 's Supermarine Walrus seaplane . Follow @-@ on attacks later that day were also unsuccessful . Two days later , B5Ns destroyed HNLMS Van Ghent , a Dutch destroyer that had run aground in the Gaspar Strait and been abandoned on 14 February . The carrier sailed to Saigon , French Indochina the next day and arrived on 20 February . A week later she was assigned to cover the convoy taking troops to Jakarta , Java . Her aircraft participated in the Second Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March and six B5Ns sank the American destroyer Pope after it had been abandoned by its crew . Six other B5Ns bombed the port of Semarang , possibly setting one merchantman on fire . 
 Ryūjō arrived in Singapore on 5 March and the ship supported operations in Sumatra and escorted convoys to Burma and the Andaman Islands for the rest of the month . On 1 April , while the 1st Air Fleet was starting its raid in the Indian Ocean , Malay Force , consisting of Ryūjō , six cruisers , and four destroyers , left Burma on a mission to destroy merchant shipping in the Bay of Bengal . B5Ns damaged one freighter on 5 April before the force split into three groups . Ryūjō 's aircraft bombed the small ports of Cocanada and Vizagapatam on the southeastern coast of India the next day , doing little damage , in addition to claiming two ships sunk and six more damaged during the day . The carrier and her escorts , the light cruiser Yura and the destroyer Yugiri claimed to have sunk three more ships by gunfire . All together , Malay Force sank 19 ships totaling almost 100 @,@ 000 gross register tons ( GRT ) , before reuniting on 7 April and arriving at Singapore on 11 April . A week later , her B5Ns were detached for torpedo training and the ship arrived at Kure on 23 April for a brief refit . 
 The newly commissioned carrier Jun 'yō joined Carrier Division 4 , under the command of Kakuta , with Ryūjō on 3 May 1942 . They formed the core of the 2nd Carrier Strike Force , part of the Northern Force , tasked to attack the Aleutian Islands , an operation planned to seize several of the islands to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the Kurile Islands while the main body of the American fleet was occupied defending Midway . Ryūjō 's air group now consisted of 12 A6M2 Zeros and 18 B5Ns , plus two spares of each type . The ship transferred to Mutsu Bay on 25 May and then to <unk> on 1 June before departing the same day for the Aleutians . 
 At dawn on 3 June , she launched nine B5Ns , escorted by six Zeros , to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island . One B5N crashed on takeoff and only six of the B5Ns and all of the Zeros were able to make it through the bad weather , destroying two PBYs and inflicting significant damage on the oil storage tanks and barracks . A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack , but they failed to find the targets . One Zero from Ryūjō from the second strike was damaged by a Curtiss P @-@ 40 and crash landed on the island of Akutan . The aircraft , later dubbed the Akutan Zero , remained largely intact and was later salvaged and test @-@ flown . Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros , 11 D3As , and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor . Shortly after the aircraft were launched , the Americans attacked the carriers , but failed to inflict any damage . A Martin B @-@ 26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros , and a Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack . 
 Ryūjō arrived back at Mutsu Bay on 24 June , but departed for the Aleutians four days later to cover the second reinforcement convoy to Attu and Kiska Islands and remained in the area until 7 July in case of an American counterattack . She arrived at Kure on 13 July for a refit and was transferred to Carrier Division 2 a day later .

 The American landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August caught the Japanese by surprise . The next day , Ryūjō was transferred to Carrier Division 1 and departed for Truk on 16 August together with the other two carriers of the division , Shōkaku and Zuikaku . Her air group consisted of 24 Zeros and nine <unk> . Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Combined Fleet , ordered Truk to be bypassed and the fleet refueled at sea after an American carrier was spotted near the Solomon Islands on 21 August . At 01 : 45 on 24 August , Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo , commander of the Mobile Force , ordered Ryūjō and the heavy cruiser Tone , escorted by two destroyers , detached to move in advance of the troop convoy bound for Guadalcanal and to attack the Allied air base at Henderson Field if no carriers were spotted . This Detached Force was commanded by Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara in Tone . 
 Ryūjō launched two small airstrikes , totaling 6 B5Ns and 15 Zeros , beginning at 12 : 20 once the Diversionary Force was 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ; 230 mi ) north of Lunga Point . Four Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters from Marine Fighter Squadron VMF @-@ 223 on combat air patrol ( CAP ) near Henderson Field spotted the incoming Japanese aircraft around 14 : 20 and alerted the defenders . Ten more Wildcats from VMF @-@ 223 and VMF @-@ 212 scrambled , as well as 2 United States Army Air Corps Bell P @-@ 400s from the 67th Fighter Squadron in response . Nine of the Zeros strafed the airfield while the B5Ns bombed it with 60 @-@ kilogram ( 130 lb ) bombs to little effect . The Americans claimed to have shot down 19 aircraft , but only three Zeros and three B5Ns were lost , although another B5N was forced to crash @-@ land . Only three Wildcats were shot down in turn . 
 Around 14 : 40 , the Detached Force was spotted again by several search aircraft from the carrier USS Enterprise , although the Japanese ships did not immediately spot the Americans . They launched three Zeros as CAP at 14 : 55 , shortly before two of the searching Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers near @-@ missed Ryūjō 150 meters ( 490 ft ) astern with four 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bombs three minutes later . Two more Zeros reinforced the CAP shortly after 15 : 00 , just in time to intercept two more searching Avengers , shooting down one . In the meantime , the carrier USS Saratoga had launched an airstrike against the Detached Force in the early afternoon that consisted of 31 Douglas SBD Dauntlesses and eight Avengers ; the long range precluded fighter escort . They sighted the carrier shortly afterward and attacked . They hit Ryūjō three times with 1 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 450 kg ) bombs and one torpedo ; the torpedo hit flooded the starboard engine and boiler rooms . No aircraft from either Ryūjō or Saratoga were shot down in the attack . 
 The bomb hits set the carrier on fire and she took on a list from the flooding caused by the torpedo hit . Ryūjō turned north at 14 : 08 , but her list continued to increase although the fires were put out . The progressive flooding disabled her machinery and caused her to stop at 14 : 20 . The order to abandon ship was given at 15 : 15 and the destroyer Amatsukaze moved alongside to rescue the crew . The ships were bombed several times by multiple B @-@ 17s without effect before Ryūjō capsized about 17 : 55 at coordinates 06 ° 10 ′ S 160 ° 50 ′ E with the loss of 7 officers and 113 crewmen . 
 Fourteen aircraft that she had dispatched on raids returned shortly after Ryūjō sank and circled over the force until they were forced to ditch . Seven pilots were rescued . 
 = Seychellum = 
 Seychellum alluaudi is a species of freshwater crab endemic to the Seychelles , and the only true freshwater crab in that country . It lives in rainforest streams on the archipelago 's granitic high islands . Although it may be abundant , little is known about its biology . If its habitat were to decline in quality , S. alluaudi might become endangered , but it is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List . 
 S. alluaudi was described as a species of Deckenia in 1893 and 1894 , and later split off into the monotypic segregate genus Seychellum . Its closest relatives are the two species currently in Deckenia , both of which are found in East Africa . Several hypotheses have been published to explain how Seychellum reached its isolated location , including submerged " land bridges " and ancient vicariance , although some means of transport across the open ocean is considered the most likely explanation . 
 Adults are dark yellow to brown in colour , and have a quadrangular carapace with a width of around 50 mm ( 2 in ) . The claws are unequal in size . Seychellum differs from Deckenia in a number of characters , including the lengths of the legs and antennae , and the fact that Deckenia species have flattened legs , compared to those of Seychellum . 
 = = Description = = 
 Seychellum alluaudi is the only truly freshwater crab in the Seychelles ; all the other true crabs in the islands have marine larvae . It is common for freshwater crabs to have large eggs , and this is also seen in Seychellum ; its eggs are around 3 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 14 in ) in diameter , which Rathbun described as " very large " . 
 Adult specimens reach a carapace width of 30 – 52 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) , and a carapace length about 80 % of the width . The carapace is almost quadrangular and quite flat , in <unk> to the more rounded outline in its closest relative , Deckenia . Its surface is rough , with scattered tubercles , and is divided into distinct regions by a series of grooves . A raised ridge runs sinuously along the front of the carapace , interrupted by a groove in the centre and by grooves towards each side of the carapace . The colour of Seychellum is described as " jaune <unk> , qui <unk> <unk> marron dans la <unk> <unk> de la carapace " ( " dark yellow , which becomes quite brown in the anterior part of the carapace " ) . 
 The antennae are minute ( smaller than those of Deckenia ) , and the chelae ( claws ) are unequal in size . Whereas Deckenia has distinctly flattened walking legs , those of Seychellum are normal . Overall , Rathbun concluded that Seychellum alluaudi " differs from Deckenia [ ... ] in so many other respects that the species are not likely to be confounded " . 
 = = Taxonomic history = = 
 Seychellum alluaudi was first described in 1893 by Alphonse Milne @-@ Edwards and Eugène Louis Bouvier , as a species in the genus Deckenia , D. alluaudi ; the specific epithet commemorates Charles A. <unk> , who had collected the specimens they used . Unaware of that description , Mary J. Rathbun described " Deckenia cristata " in 1894 , in a paper published in the Proceedings of the United States National Museum ; her description was based on specimens donated to the United States National Museum by William Louis Abbott , who had travelled to the Seychelles in 1890 . At the time , the only other species in the genus was D. <unk> from the coast of East Africa , and a second species ( D. <unk> ) , also from East Africa , was added in 1898 . Rathbun synonymised D. cristata and D. alluaudi herself in 1906 . The three species of Deckenia at that time were considered to be sufficiently distinct from other crabs to warrant placement in a separate subfamily ( <unk> ) or family ( Deckeniidae ) . 
 In 1995 , Peter K. L. Ng , Zdravko <unk> and Gerhard <unk> revised the family Deckeniidae , as then circumscribed , and concluded that " D. alluaudi " could not be accommodated with the other species of Deckenia in the same genus , or even in the same family . They described a new genus , Seychellum , and the species took on its current name . They placed Seychellum in the family <unk> , leaving Deckenia as the only genus in the family Deckeniidae , and restricting its distribution to the African mainland . Following a number of phylogenetic studies , <unk> et al. reduced that taxon to a subfamily of the larger family <unk> , and Seychellum is again considered a part of it . 
 = = Distribution and biogeography = = 
 Seychellum alluaudi is endemic to the granitic high islands in the inner group of the Seychelles , in the western Indian Ocean . It is found on the four largest granitic islands – Mahé , La Digue , Silhouette and Praslin – and lives in mountain streams that flow through rainforest . 
 The closest relatives of Seychellum are the two species of Deckenia from the African mainland . The two @-@ lobed shape of the last segment of the mandibular palp , which had been used to argue for a close relationship between Seychellum and Indian crabs of the family <unk> , does not appear to be a reliable phylogenetic character . 
 The presence of a strictly freshwater species on the Seychelles is hard to explain , biogeographically . Several possible explanations have been proposed . 
 In 1902 , prior to the development of plate tectonics , Arnold Edward Ortmann proposed that land bridges formerly connected the Seychelles to other land masses . 
 It has also been suggested that the ancestors of Deckenia and Seychellum lived on a landmass comprising Seychelles and the African mainland , which then separated by continental drift ; Gondwana is believed to have split up 160 million years ago , with the Seychelles separating from the Indian Plate around 68 to 65 million years ago . An ancient origin would be supported by the absence of freshwater crabs from oceanic islands in the same area , such as Mauritius and Réunion . 
 Finally , the ancestor of Seychellum may have travelled across the western Indian Ocean by rafting , perhaps at a time when the Seychelles Bank was larger due to lower sea levels . The greater extent of the Seychelles Bank may also explain how the species is now found on four separate islands in the Seychelles archipelago . The time of divergence between Seychellum and Deckenia has been estimated independently at 27 to 8 million years ago and 12 to 5 @.@ 5 million years ago . Seychellum is reported to be more tolerant of salt water than other families of freshwater crabs , which may have allowed it to survive rafting between the African continent and the Seychelles Bank . 
 The most recent research favours trans @-@ oceanic dispersal , but some uncertainty remains . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 Of the five criteria assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature for its IUCN Red List , four cannot be assessed in Seychellum alluaudi because of a lack of information . Under the remaining criterion , which measures the species ' geographic range , the species would qualify as Endangered if there were was a " decline in habitat quality " . It is , however , abundant in places , and is present within a protected area , and is therefore listed as Least Concern .

 " Radioactive Man " is the second episode of The Simpsons ' seventh season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 24 , 1995 . The episode sees the film version of the comic book series Radioactive Man set up production in Springfield . Much to Bart 's disappointment , the part of the hero 's sidekick , Fallout Boy , goes not to him , but to Milhouse . Milhouse , however , hates acting , so he quits the role and leaves the set , forcing the producers of the film to shut down production and go back to Hollywood . 
 The episode was written by John Swartzwelder , and directed by Susie Dietter . Mickey Rooney guest starred as himself in the episode . " Radioactive Man " was the first episode of The Simpsons to be digitally colored . The episode features cultural references to the Batman television series , the 1995 film Waterworld , and the song " Lean on Me " by Bill Withers . Since airing , the episode has received positive reviews from fans and television critics . It acquired a Nielsen rating of 9 @.@ 5 , and was the fourth highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week .

 Bart and Milhouse are thrilled to hear that a film version of their favorite comic book series , Radioactive Man , is in production . Rainier Wolfcastle , the star of the McBain films , is chosen to play Radioactive Man , and even more excitingly for the Springfield Elementary School children , the production moves to their town . A search is launched for a young actor to play Radioactive Man 's sidekick Fallout Boy , and Bart auditions . Bart does well , but is rejected because he is an inch too short . Milhouse gets the part , albeit reluctantly , under pressure from his greedy parents . 
 A despondent Bart is told by Lisa that he is still needed as Milhouse 's friend and confidant , and Bart eagerly accepts this new role . However , Milhouse finds his own job intolerable and disappears , right during the filming of the most expensive scene in the movie . The film is suspended while the townspeople search for Milhouse . Eventually Bart finds him in the tree house , and despite encouragement from former child star Mickey Rooney , Milhouse gives up on his acting career . Mickey Rooney tried to take over as Fallout Boy ; however , all production on the film is aborted , with the project bankrupt , thanks to price gouging and other unscrupulous conduct by the people of Springfield . Despite Rooney 's stern lecture about their greed , Mayor Quimby insists the townspeople can not give any of the directors ' money back to them , so with their film cancelled , the directors return to Hollywood — " where people treat each other right " .

 The episode was written by John Swartzwelder , and directed by Susie Dietter . When Dietter read through his first script , she did not find it very funny because of all the visual gags . Once the animatic was finished , her opinion changed , and she thought to herself : " Hey , this is really funny ! " . 
 This is the first episode of The Simpsons to be digitally colored . The duties of that task went to <unk> , who would later work on " The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular " . Digital coloring would not be attempted again until season 12 's " Tennis the Menace " , and again in season 14 's " Treehouse of Horror XIII " . The show permanently switched to digital coloring later in that same season , beginning with " The Great Louse Detective " .

 = Battle of Hampton Roads = 
 The Battle of Hampton Roads , often referred to as either the Battle of the Monitor and Merrimack ( or Virginia ) or the Battle of Ironclads , was the most noted and arguably most important naval battle of the American Civil War from the standpoint of the development of navies . It was fought over two days , March 8 – 9 , 1862 , in Hampton Roads , a roadstead in Virginia where the Elizabeth and Nansemond rivers meet the James River just before it enters Chesapeake Bay adjacent to the city of Norfolk . The battle was a part of the effort of the Confederacy to break the Union blockade , which had cut off Virginia 's largest cities , Norfolk and Richmond , from international trade . 
 The major significance of the battle is that it was the first meeting in combat of ironclad warships , i.e. , the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia . The Confederate fleet consisted of the ironclad ram Virginia ( built from the remnants of the USS Merrimack ) and several supporting vessels . On the first day of battle , they were opposed by several conventional , wooden @-@ hulled ships of the Union Navy . On that day , Virginia was able to destroy two ships of the Federal flotilla , USS Congress and USS Cumberland , and was about to attack a third , USS Minnesota , which had run aground . However , the action was halted by darkness and falling tide , so Virginia retired to take care of her few wounded — which included her captain , Flag Officer Franklin Buchanan — and repair her minimal battle damage . 
 Determined to complete the destruction of the Minnesota , Catesby ap Roger Jones , acting as captain in Buchanan 's absence , returned the ship to the fray the next morning , March 9 . During the night , however , the ironclad Monitor had arrived and had taken a position to defend Minnesota . When Virginia approached , Monitor intercepted her . The two ironclads fought for about three hours , with neither being able to inflict significant damage on the other . The duel ended indecisively , Virginia returning to her home at the Gosport Navy Yard for repairs and strengthening , and Monitor to her station defending Minnesota . The ships did not fight again , and the blockade remained in place . 
 The battle received worldwide attention , and it had immediate effects on navies around the world . The preeminent naval powers , Great Britain and France , halted further construction of wooden @-@ hulled ships , and others followed suit . A new type of warship was produced , the monitor , based on the principle of the original . The use of a small number of very heavy guns , mounted so that they could fire in all directions was first demonstrated by Monitor but soon became standard in warships of all types . Shipbuilders also incorporated rams into the designs of warship hulls for the rest of the century .

 = = = The blockade at Norfolk = = = 
 On April 19 , 1861 , shortly after the outbreak of hostilities at Charleston Harbor , US President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a blockade of ports in the seceded states . On April 27 , after Virginia and North Carolina had also passed ordinances of secession , the blockade was extended to include their ports also . Even before the extension , local troops seized the Norfolk area and threatened the Gosport Navy Yard in Portsmouth . The commandant there , Captain Charles S. McCauley , though loyal to the Union , was immobilized by advice he received from his subordinate officers , most of whom were in favor of secession . Although he had orders from ( Union ) Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to move his ships to Northern ports , he refused to act until April 20 , when he gave orders to scuttle the ships in the yard and destroy its facilities . Nine ships were burned , among them the screw frigate USS Merrimack . One ( the old frigate Cumberland ) was towed away successfully . Merrimack burned only to the waterline , however , and her engines were more or less intact . The destruction of the navy yard was mostly ineffective ; in particular , the large drydock there was relatively undamaged and soon could be restored . Without firing a shot , the advocates of secession had gained for the South its largest navy yard , as well as the hull and engines of what would be in time its most famous warship . They had also seized more than a thousand heavy guns , plus gun carriages and large quantities of gunpowder . 
 With Norfolk and its navy yard in Portsmouth , the Confederacy controlled the southern side of Hampton Roads . To prevent Union warships from attacking the yard , the Confederates set up batteries at Sewell 's Point and Craney Island , at the juncture of the Elizabeth River with the James . ( See map . ) The Union retained possession of Fort Monroe , at Old Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula . They also held a small man @-@ made island known as the Rip Raps , on the far side of the channel opposite Fort Monroe , and on this island they completed another fort , named Fort Wool . With Fort Monroe went control of the lower Peninsula as far as Newport News . 
 Forts Monroe and Wool gave the Union forces control of the entrance to Hampton Roads . The blockade , initiated on April 30 , 1861 , cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely . To further the blockade , the Union Navy stationed some of its most powerful warships in the roadstead . There , they were under the shelter of the shore @-@ based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell 's Point and Craney Island . For most of the first year of the war , the Confederacy could do little to oppose or dislodge them . 
 = = = Birth of the ironclads = = = 
 When steam propulsion began to be applied to warships , naval constructors renewed their interest in armor for their vessels . Experiments had been tried with armor during the Crimean War , just prior to the American Civil War , and the British and French navies had each built armored ships and were planning to build others . In 1860 , the French Navy commissioned La Gloire , the world 's first ocean @-@ going ironclad warship . Great Britain followed a year later with HMS Warrior . The use of armor remained controversial , however , and the United States Navy was generally reluctant to embrace the new technology . 
 = = = = CSS Virginia = = = = 
 When the Civil War broke out , Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen R. Mallory was an early enthusiast for the advantages of armor . As he looked upon it , the Confederacy could not match the industrial North in numbers of ships at sea , so they would have to compete by building vessels that would be individually superior to those of the Union . The edge would be provided by armor . Mallory gathered about himself a group of men who were able to put his vision into practice , among them John M. Brooke , John L. Porter , and William P. Williamson . 
 When Mallory 's men searched the South for factories that could build engines to drive the heavy ships that he wanted , they found no place to do it immediately . At the best facility , the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond , building engines from scratch would take at least a year . Upon learning this , Williamson suggested taking the engines from the hulk of Merrimack , recently raised from the bed of the Elizabeth River . His colleagues promptly accepted his suggestion and expanded it , proposing that the design of their projected ironclad be adapted to the hull . Porter produced the revised plans , which were submitted to Mallory for approval . On July 11 , 1861 , the new design was accepted , and work began almost immediately . The burned @-@ out hull was towed into the graving dock that the Union Navy had failed to destroy . During the subsequent conversion process , the plans were further modified to incorporate an iron ram fitted to the prow . Her offense in addition to the ram consisted of 10 guns : six 9 in ( 230 mm ) smooth @-@ bore Dahlgrens , two 6 @.@ 4 in ( 160 mm ) and two 7 in ( 180 mm ) Brooke rifles . Trials showed that these rifles firing solid shot would pierce up to eight inches of armor plating . The Tredegar Iron works could produce both solid shot and shell , and since it was believed that Virginia would face only wooden ships , she was given only the shell . Had solid shot been used against the Monitor , the result of the battle might have been different . The armor plating , originally meant to be 1 in ( 25 mm ) thick , was replaced by double plates , each 2 in ( 51 mm ) thick , backed by 24 in ( 61 cm ) of iron and pine . The armor was pierced for 14 gunports : four on each broadside , three forward , and three aft . The revisions , together with the usual problems associated with the transportation system of the South , resulted in delays that pushed out the launch date until February 3 , 1862 , and she was not commissioned until February 17 , bearing the name CSS Virginia . 
 = = = = USS Monitor = = = = 
 Intelligence that the Confederates were working to develop an ironclad caused consternation for the Union , but Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles waited for Congress to meet to request permission to consider building armored vessels ; Congress gave this permission on August 3 , 1861 . Welles appointed a commission , which came to be known as the Ironclad Board , of three senior naval officers to choose among the designs that were submitted for consideration . The three men were Captains Joseph Smith and Hiram Paulding , and Commander Charles Henry Davis . The board considered seventeen designs , and chose to support three . First of the three to be completed , even though she was by far the most radical in design , was Swedish engineer and inventor John Ericsson 's USS Monitor . 
 Ericsson 's Monitor , which was built at Ericsson 's yard on the East River in Greenpoint , Brooklyn , incorporated new and striking design features , the most significant of which were her armor and armament . Instead of the large numbers of guns of rather small bore that had characterized warships in the past , Ericsson opted for only two guns of large caliber ; he wanted to use 15 in ( 380 mm ) guns , but had to settle for 11 in ( 280 mm ) Dahlgren guns when the larger size were unavailable . These were mounted in a cylindrical turret , 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) in diameter , 9 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) high , covered with iron 8 in ( 200 mm ) thick . The whole rotated on a central spindle , and was moved by a steam engine that could be controlled by one man . Ericsson was afraid that using the full 30 pounds of black powder to fire the huge cannon would raise the risk of an explosion in the turret . He demanded that a charge of 15 pounds be used to lessen this possibility . As with Virginia , it was found that the full charge would pierce armor plate , a finding that would have affected the outcome of the battle . A serious flaw in the design was the pilot house from which the ship would be conned , a small structure forward of the turret on the main deck . Its presence meant that the guns could not fire directly forward , and it was isolated from other activities on the ship . Despite the late start and the novelty of construction , Monitor was actually completed a few days before her counterpart Virginia , but Virginia was activated first .

 The Confederate chain of command was anomalous . Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones had directed much of the conversion of Merrimack to Virginia , and he was disappointed when he was not named her captain . Jones was retained aboard Virginia , but only as her executive officer . Ordinarily , the ship would have been led by a captain of the Confederate States Navy , to be determined by the rigid seniority system that was in place . Secretary Mallory wanted the aggressive Franklin Buchanan , but at least two other captains had greater seniority and had applied for the post . Mallory evaded the issue by appointing Buchanan , head of the Office of Orders and Detail , flag officer in charge of the defenses of Norfolk and the James River . As such , he could control the movements of Virginia . Technically , therefore , the ship went into the battle without a captain . 
 On the Union side , command of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron was held by Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough . He had devised a plan for his frigates to engage Virginia , hoping to trap her in their crossfire . In the event , his plan broke down completely when four of the ships ran aground ( one of them intentionally ) in the confined waters of the roadstead . On the day of battle , Goldsborough was absent with the ships cooperating with the Burnside Expedition in North Carolina . In his absence , leadership fell to his second in command , Captain John Marston of USS Roanoke . As Roanoke was one of the ships that ran aground , Marston was unable to materially influence the battle , and his participation is often disregarded . Most accounts emphasize the contribution of the captain of Monitor , John L. Worden , to the neglect of others . 
 = = = March 8 : Virginia wreaks havoc on wooden Union warships = = = 
 The battle began when the large and unwieldy CSS Virginia steamed into Hampton Roads on the morning of March 8 , 1862 . Captain Buchanan intended to attack as soon as possible . Virginia was accompanied from her moorings on the Elizabeth River by Raleigh and Beaufort , and was joined at Hampton Roads by the James River Squadron , Patrick Henry , Jamestown , and Teaser . When they were passing the Union batteries at Newport News , Patrick Henry was temporarily disabled by a shot in her boiler that killed four of her crew . After repairs , she returned and rejoined the others . 
 At this time , the Union Navy had five warships in the roadstead , in addition to several support vessels . The sloop @-@ of @-@ war USS Cumberland and frigate Congress were anchored in the channel near Newport News . Frigate St. Lawrence and the steam frigates Roanoke and Minnesota were near Fort Monroe , along with the storeship USS Brandywine ( 1825 ) . The latter three got under way as soon as they saw Virginia approaching , but all soon ran aground . St. Lawrence and Roanoke took no further important part in the battle . 
 Virginia headed directly for the Union squadron . The battle opened when Union tug Zouave fired on the advancing enemy , and Beaufort replied . This preliminary skirmishing had no effect . Virginia did not open fire until she was within easy range of Cumberland . Return fire from Cumberland and Congress bounced off the iron plates without penetrating , although later some of Cumberland 's payload lightly damaged Virginia . 
 Virginia rammed Cumberland below the waterline and she sank rapidly , " gallantly fighting her guns as long as they were above water , " according to Buchanan . She took 121 seamen down with her ; those wounded brought the casualty total to nearly 150 . 
 Ramming Cumberland nearly resulted in the sinking of Virginia as well . Virginia 's bow ram got stuck in the enemy ship 's hull , and as Cumberland listed and began to go down , she almost pulled Virginia under with her . At the time the vessels were locked , one of Cumberland 's anchors was hanging directly above the foredeck of Virginia . Had it come loose , the two ships might have gone down together . Virginia broke free , however , her ram breaking off as she backed away . 
 Buchanan next turned Virginia on Congress . Seeing what had happened to Cumberland , Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith , captain of Congress , ordered his ship grounded in shallow water . By this time , the James River Squadron , commanded by John Randolph Tucker , had arrived and joined Virginia in the attack on Congress . After an hour of unequal combat , the badly damaged Congress surrendered . While the surviving crewmen of Congress were being ferried off the ship , a Union battery on the north shore opened fire on Virginia . In retaliation , Buchanan ordered Congress fired upon with hot shot , cannonballs heated red @-@ hot . Congress caught fire and burned throughout the rest of the day . Near midnight , the flames reached her magazine and she exploded and sank , stern first . Personnel losses included 110 killed or missing and presumed drowned . Another 26 were wounded , of whom ten died within days . 
 Although she had not suffered anything like the damage she had inflicted , Virginia was not completely unscathed . Shots from Cumberland , Congress , and Union troops ashore had riddled her smokestack , reducing her already low speed . Two of her guns were disabled and several armor plates had been loosened . Two of her crew were killed , and more were wounded . One of the wounded was Captain Buchanan , whose left thigh was pierced by a rifle shot . 
 Meanwhile , the James River Squadron had turned its attention to Minnesota , which had left Fort Monroe to join in the battle and had run aground . After Virginia had dealt with the surrender of Congress , she joined the James River Squadron despite her damage . Because of her deep draft and the falling tide , however , Virginia was unable to get close enough to be effective , and darkness prevented the rest of the squadron from aiming their guns to any effect . The attack was therefore suspended . Virginia left with the expectation of returning the next day and completing the task . She retreated into the safety of Confederate @-@ controlled waters off Sewell 's Point for the night , but had killed 400 enemy sailors and had lost two . The Union had lost two ships and three were aground . 
 The United States Navy 's greatest defeat until World War II caused panic in Washington . As Lincoln 's Cabinet met to discuss the disaster , the frightened Secretary of War Edwin Stanton told the others that the Virginia might attack East coast cities , and even shell the White House before the meeting ended . Welles assured his colleagues that they were safe as the ship could not traverse the Potomac River . He added that the Union also had an ironclad , and that it was heading to meet the Virginia . 
 = = = March 9 : Monitor engages Virginia = = = 
 Both sides used the respite to prepare for the next day . Virginia put her wounded ashore and underwent temporary repairs . Captain Buchanan was among the wounded , so command on the second day fell to his executive officer , Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones . Jones proved to be no less aggressive than the man he replaced . While Virginia was being prepared for renewal of the battle , and while Congress was still ablaze , Monitor , commanded by Lieutenant John L. Worden , arrived in Hampton Roads . The Union ironclad had been rushed to Hampton Roads in hopes of protecting the Union fleet and preventing Virginia from threatening Union cities . Captain Worden was informed that his primary task was to protect Minnesota , so Monitor took up a position near the grounded Minnesota and waited . " All on board felt we had a friend that would stand by us in our hour of trial , " wrote Captain Gershom Jacques Van Brunt , the vessel 's commander , in his official report the day after the engagement . 
 The next morning , at dawn on March 9 , 1862 , Virginia left her anchorage at Sewell 's Point and moved to attack Minnesota , still aground . She was followed by the three ships of the James River Squadron . They found their course blocked , however , by the newly arrived Monitor . At first , Jones believed the strange craft — which one Confederate sailor mocked as " a cheese on a raft " — to be a boiler being towed from the Minnesota , not realizing the nature of his opponent . Soon , however , it was apparent that he had no choice but to fight her . The first shot of the engagement was fired at Monitor by Virginia . The shot flew past Monitor and struck Minnesota , which answered with a broadside ; this began what would be a lengthy engagement . " Again , all hands were called to quarters , and when she approached within a mile of us I opened upon her with my stern guns and made a signal to the Monitor to attack the enemy , " Van Brunt added . 
 After fighting for hours , mostly at close range , neither could overcome the other . The armor of both ships proved adequate . In part , this was because each was handicapped in her offensive capabilities . Buchanan , in Virginia , had not expected to fight another armored vessel , so his guns were supplied only with shell rather than armor @-@ piercing shot . Monitor 's guns were used with the standard service charge of only 15 lb ( 6 @.@ 8 kg ) of powder , which did not give the projectile sufficient momentum to penetrate her opponent 's armor . Tests conducted after the battle showed that the Dahlgren guns could be operated safely and efficiently with charges of as much as 30 lb ( 14 kg ) . 
 The battle finally ceased when a shell from Virginia struck the pilot house of Monitor and exploded , driving fragments of paint and iron through the viewing slits into Worden 's eyes and temporarily blinding him . As no one else could see to command the ship , Monitor was forced to draw off . The executive officer , Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene , took over , and Monitor returned to the fight . In the period of command confusion , however , the crew of Virginia believed that their opponent had withdrawn . Although Minnesota was still aground , the falling tide meant that she was out of reach . Furthermore , Virginia had suffered enough damage to require extensive repair . Convinced that his ship had won the day , Jones ordered her back to Norfolk . At about this time , Monitor returned , only to discover her opponent apparently giving up the fight . Convinced that Virginia was quitting , with orders only to protect Minnesota and not to risk his ship unnecessarily , Greene did not pursue . Thus , each side misinterpreted the moves of the other , and as a result each claimed victory . 
 Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory wrote to Confederate President Davis of the action : 
 The conduct of the Officers and men of the squadron … reflects unfading honor upon themselves and upon the Navy . The report will be read with deep interest , and its details will not fail to rouse the ardor and nerve the arms of our gallant seamen . It will be remembered that the Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture , wholly unlike any ship that ever floated ; that her heaviest guns were equal novelties in ordnance ; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried , and her officers and crew strangers , comparatively , to the ship and to each other ; and yet , under all these disadvantages , the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record . 
 In Washington , belief that Monitor had vanquished Virginia was so strong that Worden and his men were awarded the Thanks of Congress : 
 Resolved . . . That the thanks of Congress and the American people are due and are hereby tendered to Lieutenant J. L. Worden , of the United States Navy , and to the officers and men of the ironclad gunboat Monitor , under his command , for the skill and gallantry exhibited by them in the remarkable battle between the Monitor and the rebel ironclad steamer Merrimack . 
 During the two @-@ day engagement , the U.S.S. Minnesota shot off 78 rounds of 10 @-@ inch solid shot ; 67 rounds of 10 @-@ inch solid shot with 15 @-@ second fuse ; 169 rounds of 9 @-@ inch solid shot ; 180 9 @-@ inch shells with 15 @-@ second fuse ; 35 8 @-@ inch shells with 15 @-@ second fuse and 5 @,@ 567 @.@ 5 pounds of service powder . Three crew members , Alexander Winslow , Henry Smith and Dennis Harrington were killed during the battle and 16 were wounded . One of Monitor 's crew , Quartermaster Peter Williams , was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle . 
 = = = Spring 1862 — a standoff at Hampton Roads = = = 
 Virginia remained in drydock for almost a month , getting repairs for battle damage as well as minor modifications to improve her performance . On April 4 , she was able to leave drydock . Buchanan , still recovering from his wound , had hoped that Catesby Jones would be picked to succeed him , and most observers believed that Jones 's performance during the battle was outstanding . The seniority system for promotion in the Navy scuttled his chances , however , and the post went to the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Commodore Josiah Tattnall . Monitor , not severely damaged , remained on duty . Like his antagonist Jones , Greene was deemed too young to remain as captain ; the day after the battle , he was replaced with Lieutenant Thomas O. Selfridge . Two days later , Selfridge was in turn relieved by Lieutenant William Nicholson Jeffers . 
 By late March , the Union blockade fleet had been augmented by hastily refitted civilian ships , including the powerful SS Vanderbilt , SS Arago , SS Illinois , and SS Ericsson . These had been outfitted with rams and some iron plating . By late April , the new ironclads USRC E. A. Stevens and USS Galena and had also joined the blockade . 
 Each side considered how best to eliminate the threat posed by its opponent , and after Virginia returned each side tried to goad the other into attacking under unfavorable circumstances . Both captains declined the opportunity to fight in water not of their own choosing ; Jeffers in particular was under positive orders not to risk his ship . Consequently , each vessel spent the next month in what amounted to posturing . Not only did the two ships not fight each other , neither ship ever fought again after March 9 . 
 = = = Destruction of the combatants = = = 
 The end came first for Virginia . Because the blockade was unbroken , Norfolk was of little strategic use to the Confederacy , and preliminary plans were laid to move the ship up the James River to the vicinity of Richmond . Before adequate preparations could be made , the Confederate Army under Major General Benjamin Huger abandoned the city on May 9 , without consulting anyone from the Navy . Virginia 's draft was too great to permit her to pass up the river , which had a depth of only 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) , and then only under favorable circumstances . She was trapped and could only be captured or sunk by the Union Navy . Rather than allow either , Tatnall decided to destroy his own ship . He had her towed down to Craney Island in Portsmouth , where the gang were taken ashore , and then she was set afire . She burned through the rest of the day and most of the following night ; shortly before dawn , the flames reached her magazine , and she blew up . 
 Monitor likewise did not survive the year . She was ordered to Beaufort , North Carolina , on Christmas Day , to take part in the blockade there . While she was being towed down the coast ( under command of her fourth captain , Commander John P. Bankhead ) , the wind increased and with it the waves ; with no high sides , the Monitor took on water . Soon the water in the hold gained on the pumps , and then put out the fires in her engines . The order was given to abandon ship ; most men were rescued by USS Rhode Island , but 16 went down with her when she sank in the early hours of December 31 , 1862 . 
 = = Who won ? = = 
 The victory claims that were made by each side in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Hampton Roads , based as both were on misinterpretations of the opponent 's behavior , have been dismissed by present @-@ day historians . They agree that the result of the Monitor – Merrimack encounter was not a victory for either side . As the combat between ironclads was the primary significance of the battle , the general verdict is that the overall result was a draw . All would acknowledge that the Southern fleet inflicted far more damage than it received , which would ordinarily imply that they had gained a tactical victory . Compared to other Civil War battles , the loss of men and ships for the Union Navy would be considered a clear defeat . On the other hand , the blockade was not seriously threatened , so the entire battle can be regarded as an assault that ultimately failed . 
 However , initially after the Battle of Hampton Roads , both the Confederates and the Unions used media to claim victory for their own sides . The headline a Boston newspaper the day after the battle read " The Merrimac Driven back by the Steamer ! " , implying a Union victory , while Confederate media focused on their original success against wooden Union ships . Despite the battle ending in a stalemate , it was seen by both sides as an opportunity to raise war @-@ time morale , especially since the ironclad ships were an exciting naval innovation that intrigued citizens . 
 Evaluation of the strategic results is likewise disputed . The blockade was maintained , even strengthened , and Virginia was bottled up in Hampton Roads . Because a decisive Confederate weapon was negated , some have concluded that the Union could claim a strategic victory . Confederate advocates can counter , however , by arguing that Virginia had a military significance larger than the blockade , which was only a small part of the war in Tidewater Virginia . Her mere presence was sufficient to close the James River to Federal incursions . She also imposed other constraints on the Peninsula Campaign then being mounted by the Union Army under General George B. McClellan , who worried that she could interfere with his positions on the York River . Although his fears were baseless , they continued to affect the movements of his army until Virginia was destroyed . 
 = = Impact upon naval warfare = = 
 Both days of the battle attracted attention from almost all the world 's navies . The USS Monitor became the prototype for the monitor warship type . She thus became the first of two ships whose names were applied to entire classes of their successors . The other was HMS Dreadnought . Many more were built , including river monitors , and they played key roles in Civil War battles on the Mississippi and James rivers . The US immediately started the construction of ten more monitors based on Ericsson 's original larger plan , known as the Passaic @-@ class monitors . However , while the design proved exceptionally well @-@ suited for river combat , the low profile and heavy turret caused poor seaworthiness in rough waters . Russia , fearing that the American Civil War would spill into Russian Alaska , launched ten sister ships , as soon as Ericsson 's plans reached St. Petersburg . What followed has been described as " Monitor mania " . The revolving turret later inspired similar designs for future warships , which eventually became the modern battleship . 
 The vulnerability of wooden hulls to armored ships was noted particularly in Britain and France , where the wisdom of the planned conversion of the battle fleet to armor was given a powerful demonstration . Another feature that was emulated was not so successful . Impressed by the ease with which the Virginia had sunk the Cumberland , naval architects began to incorporate rams into their hull designs . The first purpose @-@ built ram in the modern era was the French armored ram <unk> ( 1863 ) , whose guns were said to have " the sole function of preparing the way for the ram . " The inclusion of rams in warship hull design persisted almost to the outbreak of World War I , despite improvements in naval gunnery that quickly made close action between warships almost suicidal , if not impossible .

 The name of the warship that served the Confederacy in the Battle of Hampton Roads has been a continuing source of confusion and some contention . She was originally a screw frigate in the United States Navy carrying the name USS Merrimack . All parties continued to use the name after her capture by secessionists while she was being rebuilt as an ironclad . When her conversion was almost complete , her name was officially changed to Virginia . Despite the official name change , Union accounts persisted in calling the Merrimack by her original name , while Confederate sources used either Virginia or Merrimac ( k ) . The alliteration of Monitor and Merrimack has persuaded most popular accounts to adopt the familiar name , even when it is acknowledged to be technically incorrect . 
 A CSS Merrimac did actually exist . She was a paddle wheel steamer named for the victor ( as most Southerners saw it ) at Hampton Roads . She was used for running the blockade until she was captured and taken into Federal service , still named Merrimac . Her name was a spelling variant of the river , namesake of USS Merrimack . Both spellings are still in use around the Hampton Roads area . 
 A small community in Montgomery County , Virginia near the location where the iron for the Confederate ironclad was forged is now known as Merrimac . Some of the iron mined there and used in the plating on the Confederate ironclad is displayed at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth . The anchor of the Virginia sits on the lawn in front of the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond .

 After resting undetected on the ocean floor for 111 years , the wreck of Monitor was located by a team of scientists in 1973 . The remains of the ship were found upside down 16 mi ( 26 km ) off Cape Hatteras , on a relatively flat , sandy bottom at a depth of about 240 ft ( 73 m ) . In 1987 , the site was declared a National Marine Sanctuary , the first shipwreck to receive this distinction . 
 Because of Monitor 's advanced state of deterioration , timely recovery of remaining significant artifacts and ship components became critical . Numerous fragile artifacts , including the innovative turret and its two Dahlgren guns , an anchor , steam engine , and propeller , have been recovered . They were transported back to Hampton Roads to the Mariners ' Museum in Newport News , Virginia , where they were treated in special tanks to stabilize the metal . It is reported that it will take about ten years for the metal to completely stabilize . The new USS Monitor Center at the Mariners ' Museum officially opened on March 9 , 2007 , and a full @-@ scale replica of USS Monitor , the original recovered turret , and artifacts and related items are now on display .

 The Battle of Hampton Roads was a significant event in both Naval and Civil War history that has been detailed in many books , televised Civil War documentaries , and in film , to include TNT 's 1991 Ironclads .

 The 1996 – 97 season was the 99th season of competitive football played by Arsenal . The club dismissed manager Bruce Rioch in the close season , who spent a year in @-@ charge . After much speculation , Frenchman Arsène Wenger was appointed as his replacement – the club 's first manager born outside of the British Isles . At the end of the campaign , Arsenal finished third in the Premier League and missed out on UEFA Champions League qualification . They made exits in the fourth round of both the FA Cup and Football League Cup to Leeds United and Liverpool respectively . In Europe , the club were eliminated in the UEFA Cup first round to Borussia Mönchengladbach of Germany . 
 Arsenal sold several fringe players in the transfer window , notably David Hillier to Portsmouth and Paul Dickov to Manchester City . Midfielders Rémi Garde and Patrick Vieira were purchased from RC Strasbourg and AC Milan respectively . John Hartson moved to West Ham United in January 1997 ; he was replaced in the squad by teenager Nicolas Anelka , who joined Arsenal a month later from Paris Saint @-@ Germain . 
 A strong start to their league campaign , with one defeat in their first 12 matches saw Arsenal begin November in first spot . Although the club were winless during the Christmas period , their chances of winning the title remained intact . A run of two draws and losses in February was more severe , as it moved Arsenal down to fourth spot . Draws in April prompted Wenger to rule his team out of the title race and make priority to second spot , which came with a qualifying spot for the Champions League . Defeat to Newcastle United in the penultimate game of the season all but ended Arsenal 's chances of finishing second , given Newcastle 's superior goal difference . A win on the final day against Derby County meant the club finished third , level on points with Newcastle and Liverpool . 
 28 different players represented the club in four competitions and there were 12 different goalscorers . Ian Wright was Arsenal 's top goalscorer of the season ; he scored 30 goals in 41 appearances .

 In June 1995 , Arsenal appointed Bruce Rioch , who had just guided Bolton Wanderers to the League Cup final and promotion to the top flight , as manager . Under his stewardship , the club broke the English transfer record by paying Internazionale £ <unk> for Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp and the new signing formed an impressive partnership with Ian Wright .

 A week before the start of the league season , Arsenal sacked manager Rioch and cited the decision was in the " best long @-@ term interest of the club " . It was alleged that a dispute over transfer funds with the board of directors prompted his departure ; his relationship moreover with David Dein according to an insider was " no longer cordial " . Stewart Houston was once again put in temporary charge , with Pat Rice serving as first team coach . Johan Cruyff was considered the favourite for the job ; George Graham , Terry Venables and David O 'Leary were other names linked to the managerial position . Houston put his name forward for the job , but upon being told that he would not be considered , resigned to take over as manager of Division One side Queens Park Rangers , leaving Rice as the team 's second caretaker manager of the season . Arsenal would eventually select Frenchman Arsène Wenger as their next manager , but did not officially announce his appointment until September 1996 , once his contract with Japanese club Nagoya Grampus Eight was terminated by mutual consent .

The team responded with a 2 – 0 win at Leicester City in a game where Wright started as a substitute but scored the decisive goal . A 3 – 3 draw with Chelsea in the first week of September was described as " outstanding " by Houston after the team had recovered from a two @-@ goal half @-@ time deficit . Although Linighan scored an injury time equaliser for Arsenal against Aston Villa , The Guardian match report suggested their most obvious problem in the match was " ... despite Merson 's valiant efforts , a lack of invention in midfield " .

The game marked the debut of Patrick Vieira , who came on as a substitute for Ray Parlour . Goals by Hartson and Wright earned the team victory against Middlesbrough and the team won a third consecutive match – at home to Sunderland – to draw level on points with league leaders Liverpool . 
 Wenger 's first match in charge of Arsenal was against winless Blackburn Rovers on 12 October 1996 . Two goals , both scored by Wright extended Arsenal 's winning league run to four matches and helped consolidate their position . A goalless draw at home to Coventry City was marred by an incident involving Wright and Coventry goalkeeper Steve <unk> that resulted in the latter having a broken nose . October concluded with a home fixture against Leeds United ; a 3 – 0 win for Arsenal marked defeat for former manager George Graham , who made his managerial return to Highbury . The team ended the month joint top of the table with Newcastle United , both on 24 points having played 11 games . 
 = = = November – February = = = 
 Arsenal 's first fixture of November was against Wimbledon . Wright after six minutes gave Arsenal the lead , only for Vinnie Jones to head in the equaliser , close to half time . Merson scored Arsenal 's second , but Marcus Gayle replied immediately , " bund [ ling ] the ball past ( David ) Seaman " . An own goal by Nigel Winterburn against Manchester United ended the champions run of three matches without a win and extended a barren run of Arsenal failing to score at Old Trafford since the creation of the Premier League . Wenger told the press he was not despondent about his first defeat as Arsenal manager : " Obviously , the way we lost was difficult to accept , but I 'm happy with the way we played . Our organisation was excellent , we kept fighting and I am very optimistic for the future . " Attention soon turned to the North London derby , where Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur on 24 November 1996 . Arsenal had not beaten their neighbours in over three years and Tottenham were unbeaten at Highbury since September 1991 . The match had ramifications in the league : a win potentially placed Arsenal in a position to move into first spot , if other results went in their favour . In the match , Wright put Arsenal into the lead through a penalty , but after 57 minutes , Sol Campbell headed on a long throw for Tottenham and the ball fell to Andy Sinton , whose shot " <unk> off the inside of the near post , then hit Lukic on the head and rebounded into the net " . Two minutes before the 90 @-@ minute mark , Tony Adams scored the winner and in injury time , Bergkamp added a third : he controlled a high ball with his left foot and evaded his marker Stephen Carr in a tight area to shoot . A 2 – 1 win against title challengers Newcastle United , having played three @-@ quarters of the match with ten men , moved Arsenal back to the top of the table . 
 Arsenal moved three points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 3 – 1 win at home to Southampton in early December . Against Derby County Vieira scored his first goal for the club to earn Arsenal a point . The team then faced Nottingham Forest , which marked Stuart Pearce debut as caretaker manager . Arsenal , without Seaman , Adams , Dixon and Vieira , succumbed to a 2 – 1 defeat , following the dismissal of Wright . The poor form over Christmas continued : Arsenal were held to a goalless draw away to Sheffield Wednesday on Boxing Day and twice let their lead against Aston Villa slip , in spite of playing " ... the best 45 minutes of football the Premiership has seen this season . " On New Year 's Day , Wright scored his 200th English league goal in Arsenal 's 2 – 0 win against Middlesbrough ; he began a three @-@ game suspension thereafter , because of his red card against Nottingham Forest . Disciplinary problems continued to beset the club : Bergkamp 's dismissal , in the team 's defeat to Sunderland on 11 January 1997 , was Arsenal 's fifth in ten matches . Wenger admitted the disciplinary record was in danger of damaging their title challenge , adding , " The other strange fact is that three out of five dismissals have been strikers , when that sort of thing normally happens to defenders . To me , that shows our strikers must be taking their fair share of kicks . When teams play Arsenal , the games are physical and we have to defend ourselves . " Arsenal kept up with Manchester United and Liverpool with a win over Everton on 19 January 1997 ; the result kept them three points behind top spot , with a game in hand . At Upton Park , the team recorded their sixth victory in seven visits to West Ham and moved second , behind " the advancing Manchester United " . 
 February saw Arsenal 's title challenge take a turn for the worse , as the team went on a four @-@ match winless run . Back @-@ to @-@ back draws against Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur , was followed by defeat to Manchester United . In the latter match , television footage showed Wright aiming a two @-@ footed challenge on opposition goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel , who was advancing to gather the ball in his half . The police stepped in to keep the players apart after the final whistle and informed the referee of the incident , which was to be later included in his report . Wright protested his innocence and complained he was subject to racial abuse by Schmeichel – at which point the FA intervened and met with representatives of both clubs . Both players eventually agreed to end their feud and by April released statements highlighting this . The month ended with a home defeat to Wimbledon , which prompted Wenger to rule out their championship hopes : " ' Yes , for the title of course , ' he replied when asked if the result had ended the team 's interest in the Premiership , ' but for Europe , no . ' " After 28 games , Arsenal were in fourth position having played two more games than Newcastle in third and one more than Manchester United , who were six points clear in first . 
 = = = March – May = = = 
 Bergkamp and Wright scored a goal apiece in Arsenal 's 2 – 0 win against Everton on the first day of March . The team won by an identical scoreline at home to Nottingham Forest a week later and kept a third consecutive <unk> against Southampton ; midfielders Stephen Hughes and Paul Shaw both got themselves on the scoresheet . Defeat at home to Liverpool on 24 March 1997 was marred by a dubious penalty awarded to striker Robbie Fowler . The player himself " stood and mouthed : ' No penalty ! ' " given Seaman made no contact in the penalty box , but the referee unaltered his decision . Although Fowler 's <unk> was later saved , the ball rebounded to Jason McAteer , who scored . Wenger ruled the team out of the title race again , by saying after the match , " Everybody knows now that it was not a penalty , but I can understand that a referee took a wrong decision . That 's football and it eliminates our chance of the championship . " 
 Wright scored his 27th goal of the season , away at Chelsea in the first week of April ; it took him seven goals short of breaking Cliff Bastin 's career record at Arsenal . A win against Leicester City was Arsenal 's fifth league win in six matches and boosted the club 's chances of finishing second , which came with a spot in the Champions League . Wenger assessed that it was " not impossible to win the title " , adding " but when you see Manchester United winning again , realistically you would like to be in their position . " A last @-@ minute equaliser for Blackburn Rovers against Arsenal on 19 April 1997 was controversial given the manner the opposition had scored ; with Hughes cramped , Vieira kicked the ball out in order for his teammate to be treated . It was anticipated " by the game 's conventions " , Blackburn should have thrown the ball back unchallenged , but striker Chris Sutton forced a corner . The result prompted Wenger to rule out any chance of winning the league : " The best team [ Manchester United ] has won . But the race for second place is still open and for many weeks I have thought that was the best we could achieve . " A further draw against Coventry City , who were fighting to stay another season in the top @-@ flight , moved Arsenal to within four points of Manchester United . They had however played two games more than the incumbent champions and one more than Liverpool sitting in third . Robbie Elliott scored the winner for Newcastle United against Arsenal on 3 May 1997 , which reignited their chances of finishing second . Arsenal ended their league campaign against Derby County , who staged their final match at the Baseball Ground . In spite of winning by three goals to one , having played with ten men for the majority of the game , they missed out on second by goal difference to Newcastle .

 Arsenal entered the competition in the third round , by virtue of their Premier League status . Their opening match was a score draw against Sunderland , which highlighted the team 's shortcomings in attack , as Wright was out of the side . In the replay staged at Roker Park , Bergkamp scored the opener early in the second half , in what he described as " ... not only a beautiful goal , it was an important goal " . The player received the ball from Merson and with the Sunderland defence closing in , twice dragged the ball with his studs , before curling it beyond goalkeeper Lionel Pérez ' reach . Hughes increased the team 's lead on the hour mark , by heading the ball in at the far post ; it was his first goal at senior level . Arsenal exited the cup in the fourth round , with defeat to fellow Premier League side Leeds United . Striker Rod Wallace scored the only goal of the match .

 Together with the other clubs playing in European competitions , Arsenal entered the Football League Cup in the third round . The team were drawn to face First Division Stoke City , on the week of 21 October 1996 . The tie ended 1 – 1 and was subject to a replay ; Wright equalised for Arsenal after Mike Sheron gave Stoke a first half lead . Arsenal won the replay by five goals to two , but exited the cup in the fourth round against league rivals Liverpool – the result marked the first time in four years that Arsenal had conceded four goals . Wenger described Bould 's dismissal for a second bookable offence as " hard " , before congratulating his opponents : " Liverpool are the best team we have played against since I 've been at Arsenal . We didn 't deserve to lose to Manchester United but we did deserve to lose to Liverpool . "

 Arsenal entered the UEFA Cup in the first round , a competition which they qualified for by virtue of finishing fifth the previous league season . They were drawn to play German team Borussia Mönchengladbach , twice winners of the cup in the 1970s . In the first leg , staged at Highbury , Arsenal lost Bergkamp through injury before the half @-@ hour ; the player was replaced by fellow Dutchman Glenn Helder . Monchengladbach took the lead in the 37th minute , after Peter Nielsen 's forward pass met Andrzej Juskowiak , who slipped the ball past an advancing Seaman . Moments after the second half commenced , the away team doubled their lead : captain Stefan Effenberg had taken advantage of Linighan 's defensive mistake , which allowed him to shoot . Although Seaman saved the first shot , Effenberg followed up and placed the ball into the top corner of the net . Merson half the deficit in the 54th minute , but Stephan <unk> increased Monchengladbach 's advantage with ten minutes to go ; he headed the ball unchallenged past Seaman . Wright scored Arsenal 's second goal of the match in stoppage time , on a night where Houston admitted it was " my worst night in Europe " . 
 A fortnight later , Arsenal played the second leg , with Adams returning to the side , deployed in a five @-@ man defence . This did not keep Monchengladbach quiet , for it was they who scored the opening goal , through Juskowiak . Wright replied for Arsenal two minutes before the break and the team brought the aggregate scoreline level , when Merson " pump [ ed ] home a cracking 25 @-@ yard drive into the top right @-@ hand corner . " Effenberg equalised , by which point Arsenal had made attacking substitutions to score a third goal . Late in the match , Juskowiak scored his second on the counter , to help Monchengladbach win 6 – 4 on aggregate score . Wenger , who was in attendance , did not precede over the match officially , but suggested " one or two changes " to caretaker manager and later assistant Pat Rice during the interval .

 = Nikolai Kulikovsky = 
 Nikolai Alexandrovich Kulikovsky ( 5 November 1881 – 11 August 1958 ) was the second husband of Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia , the sister of Tsar Nicholas II and daughter of Tsar Alexander III . 
 He was born into a military landowning family from the south of the Russian Empire , and followed the family tradition by entering the army . In 1903 , he was noticed by Grand Duchess Olga during a military review , and they became close friends . Olga wanted to divorce her first husband , Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg , and marry Kulikovsky , but neither her husband nor her brother , the Tsar , would allow it . 
 During World War I , Olga eventually obtained a divorce and married Kulikovsky . They had two sons . Her brother was deposed in the Russian Revolution of 1917 , and Kulikovsky was dismissed from the army by the revolutionary government . The Kulikovskys were forced into exile , and he became a farmer and businessman in Denmark , where they lived until after World War II . In 1948 , they emigrated to Canada as agricultural immigrants , but within four years of their arrival they had sold their farm and moved into a small suburban house . He became increasingly disabled by back pain , and died in 1958 aged 76 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Nikolai Kulikovsky was born into a military family from the Voronezh province of Russia . His grandfather was a general during the Napoleonic Wars , and his family owned two large estates in the Ukraine . He rode from an early age , became an expert horseman , and was educated at Petrograd Real College of Gurevich , followed by the Nikolai Cavalry College , from where he graduated with a degree . 
 He joined the Blue Cuirassier regiment of the imperial Russian cavalry shortly before 1903 . Grand Duke Michael , the younger brother of Tsar Nicholas II , was the regiment 's honorary colonel . In April 1903 , during a military parade at the Pavlovsk Palace , Grand Duchess Olga , the youngest sister of Nicholas and Michael , saw Kulikovsky and begged Michael to arrange the seating at a casual luncheon so that she and Kulikovsky were adjacent . The Grand Duchess was already married to Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg , who was covertly believed by his friends and family to be homosexual . A few days after her brief meeting with Kulikovsky , Olga asked Oldenburg for a divorce , which he refused with the qualification that he would reconsider his decision after seven years . 
 Kulikovsky was appointed as captain in the Blue Cuirassiers and posted to the provinces . By 1906 , he and Olga were corresponding regularly , when Olga 's husband Duke Peter appointed Kulikovsky as his aide @-@ de @-@ camp . With Peter 's permission , Kulikovsky moved into the 200 @-@ room residence in Sergievskaya Street , Saint Petersburg , that Peter shared with Olga . According to a fellow officer , gossip about a possible romance between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess , based on little more than their holding hands in public , spread through high society . 
 = = Marriage and revolution = = 
 Though Olga repeatedly asked Tsar Nicholas II to allow her to divorce , her brother refused on religious and dynastic grounds ; he believed marriage was for life and that royalty should marry within royalty . When their brother , Grand Duke Michael , eloped with his mistress , Natasha Wulfert , the Tsar and Olga were scandalized along with the rest of society . Natasha was a commoner who had been divorced twice , and one of her former husbands was an officer in the same regiment as Kulikovsky . Michael was banished from Russia , and the likelihood of the Tsar ever granting Olga 's divorce , or permitting her to marry a commoner , looked remote . 
 At the outbreak of World War I , Kulikovsky was sent to the front with his regiment . Michael was recalled from abroad , and Olga went to work in a military hospital as a nurse . Olga continued to press the Tsar to allow her divorce . In a letter she wrote , " ... finish with the divorce now during the war while all eyes and minds are occupied elsewhere — and such a small thing would be lost in all the greater things " . The war went badly for the Russian imperial forces , and the Central Powers , led by Germany , advanced into Russia . Fearful for Kulikovsky 's safety , Olga pleaded with the Tsar to transfer him to the relative safety of Kiev , where she was stationed at a hospital . In 1916 , after visiting her in Kiev , the Tsar officially annulled her marriage to Duke Peter , and she married Kulikovsky on 16 November 1916 , in the <unk> @-@ <unk> Church on <unk> ( Three Saints Street ) in Kiev . Only the officiating priest , Olga 's mother the Dowager Empress Marie , Olga 's brother @-@ in @-@ law Grand Duke Alexander , two fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev and four officers of the Akhtyrsky regiment , of which Olga was honorary colonel , attended . Their two @-@ week honeymoon was spent in a farmhouse in Podgorny that had belonged to family friends of the Kulikovskys . After visiting Kulikovsky 's parents and grandmother in Kharkov , Olga and Kulikovsky returned to Kiev . 
 During the war , internal tensions and economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew . After Nicholas II was deposed in early 1917 , many members of the Romanov dynasty , including Nicholas and his immediate family , were held under house arrest . The new government retired Kulikovsky from the army with the rank of lieutenant @-@ colonel . Dowager Empress Marie , Grand Duke Alexander , Grand Duchess Olga , and Kulikovsky managed to escape to the Crimea where they lived for a time before they too were placed under house arrest at one of the imperial estates . As a commoner , Kulikovsky was permitted more freedom of movement than the Romanovs , and was occasionally able to leave the estate in a pony @-@ cart , which allowed him to run errands , obtain food , and seek news of the outside . On 12 August 1917 , Olga and Kulikovsky 's first child and son , Tikhon , was born in the Crimea . He was named after one of the Grand Duchess 's favorite saints , Tikhon of <unk> . Although the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another , Tikhon received no titles because his father was a commoner . 
 As newspapers were banned and letters infrequent , the Romanovs under house arrest knew little of the fate of Tsar Nicholas and his family . Nicholas , his wife , and their children , were originally held at their official residence , the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo , but the provisional government under Alexander Kerensky relocated them to Tobolsk , Siberia . Eventually , in July 1918 , after being transferred to Yekaterinburg , Nicholas and his family were killed by their Bolshevik guards . In the Crimea , the Grand Duchess 's family were condemned to death by the Yalta revolutionary council but the executions were stayed by the Sevastopol council , who refused to act without orders from Moscow . In March 1918 , German forces advanced on the Crimea , and the revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones . 
 When Germany surrendered to the Allies of World War I in November 1918 , the German troops evacuated , allowing the surviving members of the imperial family time to escape abroad . The British warship HMS Marlborough rescued the Dowager Empress Marie and some of her family from the Crimea but Grand Duchess Olga and Kulikovsky decided to stay in Russia and travelled to the Caucasus region , where the Bolsheviks had been pushed back by the White Army . During the journey , a coupling on the train carriage in which they were travelling developed a fault , possibly from sabotage , and Kulikovsky crawled over the carriage roofs to reach the driver and stop the train . In the Caucasus , Kulikovsky took a job working on a farm as he was unable to secure a military posting in the White Army because the commanding general , Anton Denikin , wished to avoid association with the Romanovs . In a rented farmhouse at the large Cossack village of <unk> Olga and Kulikovsky 's second son , Guri , was born on 23 April 1919 . He was named after Guri <unk> , who had been killed serving in Olga 's Akhtyrsky regiment . As the White Army was pushed back and the Red Army approached , the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia ; they travelled to Rostov @-@ on @-@ Don , and from there took refuge at Novorossiysk in the residence of the Danish consul , Thomas Schytte , who informed them of Dowager Empress Marie 's safe arrival in Denmark . 
 After a brief stay with the Danish consul , the family were shipped to a refugee camp on the island of <unk> in the Dardanelles Strait near Istanbul , Turkey , where the Kulikovsky family shared three rooms with eleven other adults . After two weeks , they were evacuated to Belgrade in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . The Yugoslav Regent Alexander <unk> , later to become King Alexander I , offered them a permanent home there , but Dowager Empress Marie summoned her daughter to Denmark . The Grand Duchess complied , and the family arrived in Copenhagen on Good Friday 1920 . They lived with Kulikovsky 's mother @-@ in @-@ law , Dowager Empress Marie , at first at the Amalienborg Palace and then at the royal estate of Hvidøre . Kulikovsky and Marie did not get along ; he was resentful of his wife acting as Marie 's secretary and companion , and Marie was distant toward him . 
 = = Danish residency and exodus = = 
 Without a role or rank , Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark , becoming moody and listless . A spinal injury sustained during the war , for which he had to wear a corset , remained unhealed . In 1925 , Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson , who claimed to be Olga 's niece , Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia . According to Harriet von Rathlef , who witnessed the meeting , while Olga and Anderson conversed , he sat in a corner and sulked . Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson , if only because she was ill , she eventually denounced her as an impostor . Possibly , she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie . 
 Marie died on 13 October 1928 , and the Kulikovskys moved out of Hvidøre . After a brief stay in the Amalienborg Palace , the Kulikovskys moved to Holte , near <unk> , where a Danish millionaire , Gorm Rasmussen , engaged Kulikovsky to manage his stables . Hvidøre and some of Marie 's jewellery were sold . With Olga 's inheritance , Kulikovsky and his family were able to purchase Knudsminde Farm , several miles outside of Copenhagen . Kulikovsky was appointed to the board of a Russian insurance company based in Copenhagen , and oversaw the running of the farm . The farm @-@ estate became a center for the Russian monarchist and anti @-@ Bolshevik community in Denmark . 
 On 9 April 1940 , neutral Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany and was occupied for the rest of World War II . As Olga 's sons , Tikhon and Guri , served as officers in the Danish Army , they were interned as prisoners of war , but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months . Other Russian émigrés , keen to fight against the Soviets , enlisted in the German forces . Despite her sons ' internment and her mother 's Danish origins , Olga was implicated in her compatriots ' collusion with German forces , as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian émigrés fighting against communism . After the surrender of Germany in 1945 , the Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing the Grand Duchess of conspiracy against the Soviet authorities . With the end of the war , Soviet troops occupied the easternmost part of Denmark , and Olga grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt . She decided to move her family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada , a decision with which Kulikovsky complied . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In May 1948 , the Kulikovskys travelled to London by Danish troopship . They were housed in a grace @-@ and @-@ favour apartment at Hampton Court Palace while arrangements were made for their journey to Canada as agricultural immigrants . On 2 June 1948 , Kulikovsky , Olga , Tikhon and his Danish @-@ born wife <unk> , Guli and his Danish @-@ born wife Ruth , Guli and Ruth 's two children , Xenia and Leonid , and Olga 's companion and former maid Emilia Tenso ( " Mimka " ) departed Liverpool on board the Empress of Canada . After a rough crossing , the ship docked at Halifax , Nova Scotia . The family proceeded to Toronto , where they lived until they purchased a 200 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 8 km2 ) farm in Halton County , Ontario , near <unk> . Kulikovsky was relieved to move out of Toronto , and escape media attention . 
 By 1952 , the farm had become a burden to the elderly couple . Their sons had moved away ; labour was hard to come by ; Kulikovsky suffered increasing back pain and disability , and some of Olga 's remaining jewellery was stolen . The farm was sold , and Kulikovsky , Olga , and Mimka , moved to a smaller 5 @-@ room house at 2130 Camilla Road , Cooksville , Ontario , a suburb of Toronto ( now amalgamated into the city of Mississauga ) . Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid , and Olga nursed her until Mimka 's death in 1954 . Neighbours and visitors to the region , including foreign and royal dignitaries , took interest in Olga as the " last Romanov " , and visited their small home , which was also a magnet for Romanov impostors whom both Kulikovsky and Olga considered a menace . Welcome visitors included Princess Marina , Duchess of Kent , the daughter of Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia , in 1954 . 
 By 1952 , Kulikovsky had shrunk more than 4 inches ( 10 cm ) from his peak height of 6 ft 2 inches ( 188 cm ) . He distrusted conventional medicine and tried homeopathy instead . By 1958 , he was virtually paralyzed , and had difficulty sleeping . At the end of his life he was sleeping on the sofa in the living room of the couple 's Cooksville house , to avoid waking his wife . He died there on the night of 11 August 1958 . His estate was valued at 12 @,@ 123 @.@ 47 Canadian dollars , about 98 @,@ 000 Canadian dollars as of 2012 . The Grand Duchess died two years later , and was interred next to her husband in York Cemetery , Toronto .

 The Gurdon Bill Store is located in Ledyard , Connecticut . In 1818 , the land for the store was purchased by Gurdon Bill and his partner , Philip Gray . In 1819 , Gray sold his interest in the store for $ 500 . Bill operated the store until his death in 1856 and the store is believed to have made its final transaction in 1868 .

 The Gurdon Bill Store is named for Gurdon Bill , who was born in 1784 . The land was originally purchased by Bill and his partner , Philip Gray , in 1818 . Clouette notes that four years later , Bill was the sole owner of the property ; a record from 1819 says Gray sold his interest in the store to Bill for $ 500 . Bill continued to run the store until shortly before his death in 1856 . At age 21 , Bill went to Plainfield Academy and later went on to work with various merchants before setting up the store in North Groton , later incorporated as Ledyard , Connecticut . Clouette notes a brief passage of the store out of the Bill family , soon reacquired , before it was sold to the Congregational Society in 1875 . The Congregational Society has made limited use of the store , preserving its historical integrity . Local historians speculate that the store 's final transaction was made in 1868 ; afterwards the store was boarded up and left essentially unused . 
 Built in 1818 , the Gurdon Bill Store is a 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) by 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half story clapboarded store . The walls extend higher up than the ceiling to an attic for additional storage space . The wood @-@ shingled gable roof also has a smaller pent roof on the front facade that projects about 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) beyond the wall , which is unusual in New England architecture . The foundation of the store is built upon fieldstone and has stone blocks above the ground ; the store has a full cellar . The main facade has two large twelve @-@ by @-@ twelve light sliding sash windows on the left side that can be covered with three @-@ part batten shutters . The main door is a Dutch door with a plain frame and to its right is a smaller six @-@ by @-@ six sash window without a batten shutter . The rear facade is plain and devoid of any windows . The north end of has four windows , two for the attic , and the south end has only two windows for the attic , all with six @-@ over @-@ six sash . 
 The interior consists of one large room on the south end , from the main entrance , and two smaller connecting rooms on the north .

Behind the counter are tiers of pine shelving and on the west wall are built @-@ in drawers with simple wooden pulls and open bins on the bottom . The east wall has a plank bench . The two connected rooms on the north are similar with both having " plastered walls , a narrow beaded board for pegs or hooks , simple sliding shutters on the windows , beaded post casings , and brick diagonal fireplaces .

 Clouette writes , " The Gurdon Bill Store is the best preserved early 19th @-@ century store known in Connecticut . There are earlier store buildings and more elegant ones , but it would appear that the Bill Store is unique in retaining so many of its original features intact , particularly in the interior . " It was submitted to the National Historic Register of Places under criteria A for being a " country store " which supplied items that local farmers needed , but could not produce or manufacture . The building also was submitted for its well @-@ adapted and well @-@ preserved architectural integrity . The store also has an unusual pent @-@ roof and three @-@ part window shutters , the purpose of which is not entirely known . 
 Locally , the Gurdon Bill Store was rumored to have been a tavern or an inn , although no evidence or record indicates such a use , and it was apparently a waystation for stagecoaches . A historical marker in the immediate vicinity ties the Gurdon Bill store to the birthplace of Samuel Seabury , America 's first Episcopal bishop . No conclusive evidence for this claim exists .

 Crash Bandicoot : Warped is a platform game in which the player controls Crash and Coco Bandicoot , who must travel back in time and gather the 25 Crystals from the previous game in their original places in time before the antagonists of the story do so . Much of the game takes place in the Time @-@ Twisting Machine , which acts as the hub area of the game . The Time @-@ Twisting Machine is split up into five chambers ; only the first chamber is initially available . Each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels . The goal in each level is to find and obtain the Crystal hidden in the area . In some levels , the Crystal will be located at the end of a level or must be earned by completing a specific challenge . Some levels contain a " Bonus Platform " that leads to a special bonus area , where the player must navigate through a separate area and collect everything in sight . As no lives are lost in the bonus areas , the bonus areas can be played through as often as the player desires until the bonus area can be cleared . After completing all five levels in a chamber , a sixth button that opens a portal to a boss level will appear . By defeating the boss , the next chamber will become available for play . When all 25 Crystals are found and all five boss characters are defeated , the game is won . 
 Crash and Coco start the game with five lives . A life is lost when they are struck by an enemy attack or suffer any other type of damage . More lives can be earned by collecting 100 " Wumpa Fruits " or breaking open a special crate to collect a life . If the player runs out of lives , the game is over . However , it can be continued by selecting " Yes " at the " Continue ? " screen . Crash has the ability to jump into the air and land on an enemy character , spin in a tornado @-@ like fashion to knock enemies off @-@ screen , slide across the ground and perform a body slam to break certain objects . These abilities can be expanded on by defeating boss characters , often resulting in more powerful attacks or increased jumping and running prowess . 
 Boxes play a prominent role in Crash Bandicoot : Warped and can be broken with all of Crash 's techniques . Boxes contain helpful items or can augment Crash 's mobility . Check Point boxes allow the player to return to a specific point in the stage upon losing a life . TNT Boxes explode after a three @-@ second fuse when jumped on , while Nitro Boxes explode upon any physical contact . All of the Nitro Boxes in a level can be detonated at once if a green @-@ colored box with an exclamation point ( ! ) on it is touched ; contact with this box is necessary in obtaining the level 's Gem , as Nitro Boxes count towards the total number of boxes broken in the level . 
 Besides Crystals , Gems and Colored Gems can be collected for extra accomplishment . Gems are rewarded to the player if all of the crates in a level are broken open or if a secret area is completed . There is a total of 45 Gems in the game . Colored Gems are found in special levels and lead to hidden areas . There are five Colored Gems in the game . " Relics " can be won by re @-@ entering a level where the Crystal has already been retrieved . To obtain a Relic , the player must initiate the " Time Trial " mode by touching the floating stopwatch near the beginning of the level and race through a level in the pre @-@ designated time displayed before entering a level . Scattered throughout the level are yellow crates with the numbers 1 , 2 or 3 on them . When these crates are broken , the timer is frozen for the number of seconds designated by the box . As no lives are lost in the Time Trial mode , the level can be played through as often as the player desires . Sapphire , Gold and Platinum Relics can be won depending on how low the player 's final time is . The first five Relics the player receives unlocks access to a level in the " Secret Warp Room " . Every five Relics thereafter open up another level in the Secret Warp Room . The levels in the Secret Warp Room must be won before the game can be completed .

 Much of the game takes place in the Time @-@ Twisting Machine , which allows the characters to travel to different periods in time . The levels that take place in the Middle Ages are populated by wizards , rams , knights and frogs that transform into princes upon being kissed . The prehistoric levels take place in a Jurassic swamp and feature a Velociraptor hatchling that can be mounted and ridden , restless pterodactyls and a gigantic triceratops that pursues Crash throughout the level . The Arabian levels take place on the rooftops and are overrun with swordsmen , scorpions and genies who seek to stuff Crash into their lamps . The Egyptian levels are set during the heyday of the Great Pyramids and are populated by mummies , pyramid construction crews , scarabs and cobras ; in addition to the various enemies , the tombs are also overrun with traps . The future levels take place in " Neo York " , a city under Cortex 's rule that features laser cannons , robots , flying saucers , force fields and moving platforms . The " Lost Highway " levels , in which Crash pilots a motorcycle , take place in a 1950s America highway , where Crash must race against Cortex 's hot rodders to win Crystals , avoiding construction barricades and cops along the way . The World War I levels take place in the skies of Europe and alternatively feature Crash and Coco as the player character . In these levels , Cortex 's fleet of <unk> must be shot down to obtain the Crystal . The Atlantis levels are split up into two different types ; the first type features Crash as the player character , who must don scuba gear and find the Crystals in the Atlantean ruins , which are rife with sharks , depth charges and poisonous blowfish . The second type features Coco as the player character , who must ride a <unk> and gather the Crystals on the surface of the water , avoiding pirates and water mines as she does so . The Great Wall of China levels feature Coco as the player character and are played riding on the back of a tiger cub while avoiding <unk> pan carriers and Chinese dragons .

 Production of Crash Bandicoot : Warped began on January 1998 , with Naughty Dog given only 10 ½ months and a budget of $ 2 @.@ 2 million to complete the game . Programmers Andy Gavin , Stephen White and Greg Omi created three new gameplay engines for the game . Two of the three new engines were three @-@ dimensional in nature and were created for the airplane and jet @-@ ski levels ; the third new engine was created for the motorcycle levels in the style of a driving simulator . The new engines combined make up a third of the game , while the other two @-@ thirds of the game consist of the same engine used in the previous games . Jason Rubin explained that the " classic " engine and game style was preserved due to the success of the previous two games and went on to say that " were we to abandon that style of gameplay , that would mean that we would be abandoning a significant proportion of gamers out there . " An arbitrary plane z @-@ buffer was created for the jet @-@ ski and flooded Egyptian hallway levels of the game . To create a completely fluid feel for the water on these levels , an environment map that reflects the sky was fitted onto the surface of the water . A real shadow was given to the Crash character at the request of the Sony Computer Entertainment America producers , who were " sick of that little discus that 's following him around . " To create an " arcade " experience in the airplane levels and to differentiate them from flight simulators , the enemy planes were programmed to come out in front of the player and give the player ample time to shoot them before they turn around and shoot the player rather than come up behind the player and hit them from behind . The Relic system was introduced to give players a reason to return to the game after it has been completed . 
 The soundtrack of the game was produced by David Baggett and Mark Mothersbaugh and composed by Josh Mancell of Mutato Muzika . The sound effects were created by Mike Gollum , Ron Horwitz and Kevin Spears of Universal Sound Studios . Clancy Brown voiced the dual role of Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka , while Brendan O 'Brien voiced the dual role of Doctor N. Gin and Tiny the Tiger . Additionally , Michael Ensign voiced Doctor Nefarious Tropy , William Hootkins voiced Dingodile and Mel Winkler voiced Aku Aku . A small sampling of the game 's levels were prominently displayed at Sony 's Electronic Entertainment Expo booth in Atlanta , Georgia . Around this time , the video game industry wondered if Crash Bandicoot : Warped was just more of the same of the previous installment . The release of Crash Bandicoot : Warped was accompanied by marketing campaigns by Sony and Pizza Hut . The Japanese version of Crash Bandicoot : Warped was one of the first video games to support the PocketStation , a peripheral that downloads minigames from PlayStation games . A playable game demo of the Insomniac Games game Spyro the Dragon is available in the final product and can be accessed by entering a code at the title screen . 
 = = = Character and level design = = = 
 American Exitus artist Charles Zembillas , who was a character designer and art director for the previous two games , reprised his role for Crash Bandicoot : Warped . The antagonist Uka Uka was created as a presence that would cause Doctor Neo Cortex to cower in fear . The emotion sketches depicting Cortex begging for forgiveness inspired the shot design and animation for the game 's cinematic introductory sequence . Because the game 's plot involved time travel , the time @-@ traveling secondary antagonist Doctor Nefarious Tropy was conceptualized . Zembillas drew the first sketches of Tropy ( and the doodle he created as Naughty Dog was describing the character to him ) on January 22 , 1998 . Tropy 's wearable time @-@ traveling device was conceptualized early on in the character 's design evolution and initially appeared as a belt @-@ like contraption that featured a digital read out displaying the year Tropy intended to travel to . Tropy 's piston @-@ driven , smog @-@ generating time machine was made to reflect his unhealthy obsession with time . The Dingodile character was conceptualized by Naughty Dog employee Joe Labbe , who requested a character that was a cross between a dingo and a crocodile . Zembillas drew the first sketches of Dingodile on February 4 , 1998 . At certain points , the character alternatively wore an Australian style hat , had a " mop of scruffy hair " and walked on all fours . Naughty Dog initially wanted Dingodile to be a fire @-@ breathing character before Zembillas suggested giving him a flamethrower to make him " much more interesting " . The final sketches of Dingodile were drawn on February 12 , 1998 . 
 When conceiving Coco Bandicoot 's companion in the Chinese levels , it was decided that a " cute and <unk> critter " that fit the Chinese theme was needed . A panda bear was originally considered but was rejected due to its similarity to the polar bear seen in Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back . A tiger cub , Pura , was chosen as an alternative . When creating the triceratops chase sequences in the prehistoric levels , a minion of Doctor Cortex was initially animated riding the beast . Whenever the triceratops got stuck , it would thrash the minion around . The rider was ultimately removed for technical reasons . The Tyrannosaurus hatchling that Crash mounts in the prehistoric levels was drawn with chicken @-@ like proportions by Naughty Dog 's Bob Rafei . The shark seen in the game 's underwater levels was one of Jason Rubin 's first PowerAnimator models . The model was originally built for the first Crash Bandicoot game , but wasn 't used until Crash Bandicoot : Warped . 
 The " time @-@ travel @-@ around @-@ the @-@ world " theme of Crash Bandicoot : Warped allowed the Naughty Dog artists to stretch beyond the limits imposed by the island themed setting of the previous games ; each time theme has distinctly unique structures and color palettes . To demonstrate the effect that color has on the mood of an environment , level sketches , such as those of the Arabian or Medieval levels , were recolored to alter the depicted time of day from day to night . Naughty Dog aimed to visually distinguish Crash Bandicoot : Warped from previous installments by " opening up the environment " and allowing greater distances to be visible without draw @-@ in or fog ; to achieve the image of endless rolling hills and distant castles seen in the Medieval levels , level of detail was accounted for by introducing new technologies into the game engine and changing the way some of the background elements were constructed . The most detailed textures of Crash Bandicoot : Warped are located in the Egyptian Tomb levels in the form of decorative paintings . To keep the image of an endless highway in the motorcycle levels from being boring , roadside details such as cacti and telephone poles were added to the scenery . Additionally , distant mesas were added to help break up the horizon . To give the desert highway some character , full @-@ service gas stations and diners were added to the roadside to evoke a " 1950s America " flavor . The Great Wall of China is portrayed during its construction stage to add visual variety and provide gameplay obstacles . Initial ideas for the submerged Atlantis stage varied from an ancient Roman @-@ esque city in ruins to a high @-@ tech submerged city of alien origin .

" He also commented positively on the other audio effects , such as " the boiling lava " , " the raging pterodactyls " and the " zany movie voice @-@ overs " . Randy Nelson was thankful for the game 's increased musical diversity in comparison to Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back . Ryan MacDonald praised the music , sound effects and character voice @-@ overs as " outstanding " and " extremely well done " and noted that the onscreen lip @-@ synching is " almost perfectly matched to the voice . " Mark Cooke said that the game 's " over @-@ exaggerated " voice @-@ acting is " like those in good cartoons , and sometimes even better " , and cited an " equally cartoonish " aspect in the music .

The route , which is mostly a two @-@ lane undivided road , passes through the communities of <unk> and Paulsboro in the northern part of the county , a short distance south of the Delaware River . Route 44 generally runs a short distance to the north of I @-@ 295 / US 130 for much of its length . 
 In 1923 , Route 17S was legislated along the current route followed by Route 44 today , running between Penns Grove and Westville . The only portion of Route 17S ever built ran from Penns Grove to Salem . Route 44 was designated in 1927 to replace Route 17S between Penns Grove and Westville . By the 1940s , Route 44 was extended south to Salem and US 130 was designated concurrent with the route north of Penns Grove . Several spurs of Route 44 had existed or were planned prior to 1953 , including Route S44 , which ran concurrent with US 322 to the ferry between Bridgeport and Chester , Pennsylvania ; Route <unk> , a never @-@ built bypass of Camden ; and Route <unk> , which was to run from a tunnel under the Delaware River in Paulsboro east to Route 42 . In 1953 , Route 44 was replaced by US 130 north of Deepwater and by Route 49 south of there . After two bypasses were built for US 130 around Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville , Route 44 was redesignated along the former US 130 . After I @-@ 295 was completed in the 1960s , US 130 returned to its original alignment in Carneys Point and replaced that portion of Route 44 .

 Route 44 begins at an intersection with Barker Avenue and Main Street in Logan Township , heading to the east on Crown Point Road , a two @-@ lane undivided road . Shortly after beginning , the route heads through wooded areas a short distance to the north of Conrail 's Penns Grove Secondary and intersects County Route ( CR ) 671 . The road turns northeast and comes to an interchange with US 130 and continues closely parallel to the railroad line as it passes through more rural areas with some homes , coming to a junction with CR 684 . Route 44 enters Greenwich Township upon crossing the marshy <unk> Creek and becomes a local road called West Broad Street . The route passes over the railroad tracks and continues east into residential and commercial areas of <unk> , intersecting CR 607 / CR 673 and CR 680 within the town . 
 At the intersection with CR 653 , Route 44 enters Paulsboro and passes more developed areas , soon meeting CR 678 . The route intersects CR 667 in the center of Paulsboro before crossing the Mantua Creek on a lift bridge and entering wetlands within West Deptford Township . Here , the road heads into a mix of rural lands and development , crossing CR 656 and the Little Mantua Creek . Route 44 intersects the Mid @-@ Atlantic Parkway , which provides access to I @-@ 295 and US 130 a short distance to the south , before continuing into inhabited areas .

 What is now Route 44 was originally legislated as Route 17S in 1923 , a route that was to run from Penns Grove to Westville . By 1927 , however , the only portion of Route 17S that had existed was a road that ran from Penns Grove south to Salem . In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering that occurred that year , Route 44 was designated to run from Penns Grove to Westville , replacing what had been legislated as Route 17S . By the end of the 1930s , Route 44 was extended south from Penns Grove to Salem and US 130 was also designated along with Route 44 north of Penns Grove by 1941 . 
 Prior to 1953 , several spurs of Route 44 existed or were planned . Route S44 was designated in 1939 as a connection from Route 44 in Bridgeport to the ferry across the Delaware River to Chester , Pennsylvania , and was concurrent with US 322 . The S44 designation was removed in 1953 to avoid the concurrency with US 322 . In 1974 , the Commodore Barry Bridge was built , bypassing the ferry , and the old alignment of US 322 became Route 324 . Route <unk> was planned in 1938 as an eastern bypass of Camden from Route 45 in Brooklawn to Route 40 ( now Route 70 ) and Route 41 in Delaware Township ( now Cherry Hill ) , mostly along what is now CR 551 . The bypass was never built , although part of what would have been the bypass north of Haddonfield is now Route 41 . Route <unk> was planned in 1938 as an approach to a never @-@ built tunnel under the Delaware River near Paulsboro . Originally , the route was to run from the tunnel east to the intersection of Route 41 and Route 47 in Deptford Township . In 1939 , the planned route was extended east to Route 42 between Blackwood and Williamstown . 
 In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 44 was replaced by US 130 north of the Delaware Memorial Bridge approach in Deepwater and by Route 49 south of there . However , US 130 was moved to new freeway alignments around Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville . The bypassed alignments of US 130 , originally unnumbered , eventually became Route 44 . After I @-@ 295 was built in the 1960s , it bypassed the portion of the US 130 freeway in Bridgeport and was designated along the US 130 freeway north to Westville and around Carneys Point . US 130 was moved back onto its old alignment in Carneys Point , replacing that portion of Route 44 .

 = 1990 New York Giants season = 
 The 1990 New York Giants season was one of the most successful seasons in the professional football franchise 's history . The Giants , who play in the National Football Conference ( NFC ) of the National Football League ( NFL ) , won their sixth championship — and second Super Bowl — in franchise history during the season . Led by linebacker Lawrence Taylor and quarterbacks Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler , the Giants posted a 13 – 3 record and defeated the Chicago Bears and the two time defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in the NFC playoffs . In Super Bowl XXV they defeated the Buffalo Bills 20 – 19 in Tampa Stadium , against a patriotic backdrop inspired by the recently started Gulf War . The story of the season is the subject of a recent book , When the Cheering Stops , by defensive end Leonard Marshall and <unk> co @-@ writer William Bendetson . 
 After making the playoffs in 1989 , the Giants entered the 1990 season as one of the favorites to win the Super Bowl , although most believed they stood little chance of preventing a threepeat by the 49ers . They began the season with a 27 – 20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles , then won their next nine games before losing a rematch to Philadelphia 31 – 13 in week 12 . The Giants also lost close games to the 49ers on the road and Bills at home in the regular season , before defeating both teams in playoff rematches . In Week 15 during the game against Buffalo , starting quarterback Phil Simms was injured and ultimately lost for the season with a broken foot . He was replaced by Hostetler , who won the final two regular season games prior to the playoffs . The Giants defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed ( 211 ) , and the team set an NFL record by committing only 14 turnovers in the regular season . After the season , six Giants were selected to the Pro Bowl . 
 In 2007 , ESPN.com ranked the 1990 Giants ' defense as the sixth @-@ greatest in NFL history , noting that the team " allowed only 13 @.@ 2 points a game against a very tough schedule – they played against seven playoff teams during the regular season . Led by Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor , New York 's defense also came through in the playoffs , holding the Bears to just three points in the divisional playoff game . Then they allowed a tough 49ers offense just two field goals and one TD , and set up the game @-@ winning score by forcing a late fumble to win the NFC title 15 – 13 .
