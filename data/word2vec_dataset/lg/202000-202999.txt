 Knowles cites as her influences Motown girl groups such as The Supremes and The Marvelettes , and Martha Reeves , lead singer of Martha and the Vandellas . She also listened to the music of English pop singer Dusty Springfield , and according to Knowles , her " greatest music influence " is her mother , Tina Knowles , who was a one @-@ time member of the 1960s harmony group The <unk> . Knowles says her first passion is writing songs . Her early writings were vastly inspired by the writing style of French poet Paul Verlaine . She has been doing this since she was nine years old , and has collaborated with a number of songwriters and producers . 
 On her debut album , Knowles had no control over which kinds of music to produce , because " when you 're 14 , everyone else is older and more seasoned and you trust their decisions " . Knowles was more concerned with pleasing her record label by submitting to their desires . Her musical influences were better expressed on Sol @-@ Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams , when she considered herself mature and was able to write and produce songs as she wished , without worrying about the expectations of others . Knowles ' lyrics tackle relationships , world issues , and deceased friends , with her second album focusing on events in her life , such as marriage , divorce , and parenthood . The album touched upon a variety of genres including pop @-@ soul , psychedelic soul , electronica , and R & B. Knowles ' debut extended play True is a new wave album with Knowles stating , " This is a dance record , but the lyrics can get pretty dark at times . " Knowles described the EP as " eclectic with ' 80s references and African percussion influences . " Sonically the extended play is influenced by the keyboard sounds and beats of early 1980s pop and R & B music . The extended play was recorded in five cities including Santa Barbara , Los Angeles , Houston , New York , and on the German autobahn . 
 Aside from recording , Knowles occasionally paints as her hobby : " I think that painting , for me , is such an affirmative expression in that sometimes you don 't know what the outcome is gonna be and each stroke and each brush for me is an emotion and , in the end , it comes out as a piece which is the most amazing thing . ... It definitely provides a different outlet . "

 Knowles has always been compared by the media to her sister , Beyoncé , whom she considers one of her role models . She has expressed her opinion of the comparison in the lyrics to " God Given Name " : " I 'm not her and never will be " — which was purposely set as the album 's opening track to show their differences . In his review for the album , Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone magazine referred to the lyrics as a declaration of independence . In an interview with the Daily Mail , Knowles commented : " People think there should be this great rivalry between us , but there 's never been any competition . There 's a big age gap and we are two very different characters . " In another interview , Knowles said that she would not live by her sister 's level of stardom , stressing that she and Beyoncé are artistically different , even stating that blogger Teddy Birmingham was " disrespectful " for saying she was living in her sister 's shadow on his website " <unk> " in June 2009 . Beyoncé was unwilling to bring her sister into the recording industry , reasoning that it " involves a lot of pressure " . Knowles countered by saying , " It 's good to have her advice , but we really have different goals " . 
 In recent years , Solange has also garnered considerable attention as a fashion icon . Her knack for bold colors , mixed prints and retro styles as well as her knack for glamorous , fashion forward looks in her music videography and public appearances has become integral to her current image . She has been photographed wearing Alexander Wang , Alexander McQueen and Chanel . The music video for her 2012 single " Losing You " featured a heavy demonstration of the contemporary sartorial movement throughout Africa , La <unk> . Similarly , her decision to grow her natural hair initially generated strong reactions from the public . Since trimming off her straightened hair , her nostalgic and modern afro hairstyles have captured the attention of the media and the public alike .

" Slant Magazine 's Matthew Cole also praised the song writing , " ' Lift Off ' is a study in stylized blockbuster excess , with West 's best fanfare since Encore eventually being drowned out by a simulated rocket launch that will sound awesome in your car stereo provided it doesn 't cause your subwoofers to bust your windows .

 = Francis Marrash = 
 Francis bin Fathallah bin Nasrallah Marrash ( Arabic : <unk> بن <unk> الله بن <unk> <unk> / ALA @-@ LC : <unk> bin <unk> Allāh bin <unk> <unk> ; June 1836 – 1873 ) , also known as Francis al @-@ Marrash or Francis Marrash al @-@ Halabi , was a Syrian writer and poet of the Nahda movement — the Arabic renaissance — and a physician . Most of his works revolve around science , history and religion , analysed under an epistemological light . He travelled through the Middle East and France in his youth , and after some medical training and a year of practice in his native Aleppo , during which he wrote several works , he enrolled in a medical school in Paris ; yet , declining health and growing blindness forced him to return to Aleppo , where he produced more literary works until his early death . 
 Middle Eastern historian Matti <unk> considered Marrash to be the first truly cosmopolitan Arab intellectual and writer of modern times . Marrash adhered to the principles of the French Revolution and defended them in his own works , implicitly criticising Ottoman rule in the Middle East . He was also influential in introducing French romanticism in the Arab world , especially through his use of poetic prose and prose poetry , of which his writings were the first examples in modern Arabic literature , according to Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Shmuel Moreh . His modes of thinking and feeling , and ways of expressing them , have had a lasting influence on contemporary Arab thought and on the <unk> poets . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Background and education = = = 
 Francis Marrash was born in Aleppo , a city of Ottoman Syria ( present @-@ day Syria ) , to an old Melkite family of merchants known for their literary interests . Having earned wealth and standing in the 18th century , the family was well established in Aleppo , although they had gone through troubles : a relative of Francis , Butrus Marrash , was martyred by Greek Orthodox fundamentalists in April 1818 . Other Melkite Catholics were exiled from Aleppo during the persecutions , among them the priest Jibrail Marrash . Francis ' father , Fathallah , tried to defuse the Sectarian conflict by writing a treatise in 1849 , in which he rejected the Filioque . He had built up a large private library to give his three children Francis , Abdallah and Maryana a thorough education , particularly in the field of Arabic language and literature . 
 Aleppo was then a major intellectual center of the Ottoman Empire , featuring many thinkers and writers concerned with the future of the Arabs . It was in the French missionary schools that the Marrash family learnt Arabic with French and other foreign languages ( Italian and English ) . But Francis at first studied the Arabic language and its literature privately . At the age of four years , Marrash had contracted measles , and had ever since suffered from eye problems that had kept worsening over time . Hoping to find a treatment , his father had therefore taken him to Paris in 1850 ; Francis stayed there for about a year , after which he was sent back to Aleppo while his father remained in Paris . In 1853 , Francis accompanied his father once again , on a business trip of several months to Beirut , where there was a noticeable presence and cultural influence of Europeans . Francis experienced similar cultural contact later on , when he received private tutoring in medicine for four years under a British physician , in Aleppo — he had by then developed a keen interest in science , and in medicine in particular . At the same time , he wrote and published several works . Marrash practiced medicine for about a year ; however , deeming it safer for his trade to become a state @-@ licensed physician , he went to Paris in 1866 so as to continue his medical education at a school . But his fragile health and his growing blindness forced him to interrupt his studies within a year after his arrival . He returned to Aleppo completely blind , but still managed to dictate his works . 
 = = = Literary career and thought = = = 
 = = = = Ghabat al @-@ haqq = = = = 
 Around 1865 , Marrash published Ghabat al @-@ haqq ( " The Forest of Truth " or " The Forest of Justice " ) , an allegory about the conditions required to establish and maintain civilization and freedom . This allegory relates the apocalyptic vision of a war between a Kingdom of Liberty and a Kingdom of Slavery , resolved by the capture of the latter 's king and a subsequent trial before the King of Liberty , the Queen of Wisdom , the Vizier of Peace and Fraternal Love , the Commander of the Army of Civilization , with the Philosopher from the City of Light — who represents the author — as counsel . In this work , Marrash expressed ideas of political and social reforms , highlighting the need of the Arabs for two things above all : modern schools and patriotism " free from religious considerations " . In 1870 , when distinguishing the notion of fatherland from that of nation and applying the latter to Greater Syria , Marrash would point to the role played by language , among other factors , in counterbalancing religious and sectarian differences , and thus , in defining national identity . 
 Although Marrash 's poetical expression lacked the legal meticulousness found in works from Enlightened Europe , orientalist Shmuel Moreh has stated that Marrash became , with Ghabat al @-@ haqq , " the first Arab writer to reflect the optimism and humanistic view of 18th @-@ century Europe . This view stemmed from the hope that education , science and technology would resolve such problems of humanity as slavery , religious discrimination , illiteracy , disease , poverty , war , and other scourges of mankind , and it gave utterance to his hope for brotherhood and equality among peoples . " Yet , his views on freedom differed from those of the French revolutionists and of his Middle Eastern contemporaries ; indeed , he considered pleading for freedom on the basis of natural analogy to be superficial , for even nature responds to its own set of rules , according to Marrash . As a consequence , nothing in the universe may yearn for liberty without satisfying essential rules and needs that guarantee its existence . Being one of these , the need for progress may therefore justify the abolition of any restriction that does not serve as a regulator for a good system . In light of this reasoning , and in reference to the ongoing American Civil War , he thus in Ghabat al @-@ haqq supported the abolition of slavery . 
 But the significance of this work also lay in Marrash 's attempt to blend European thought with his own reading of the Christian belief in universal love . Indeed , he had tried to reconcile his philosophical understanding of the concept of liberty with his belief in the benevolence of the Catholic Church 's authority . As stated by <unk> Saba Yared : 
 He argued that only the spiritual kingdom [ i.e. the kingdom centered on religion ] could curb evil [ ... ] and consequently guarantee the freedom of man . Love is one of the pillars of Christianity , and Marrash , like some Sufis and Romantics , considered it to be the basis of civilization , indeed of the entire universe [ ... ] . Since love , for Marrash , was the general law , and freedom meant participation in that law , it followed that freedom would be inseparable from love and religion . 
 = = = = Later writings = = = = 
 In 1867 , Marrash published <unk> Baris , an account of his second journey to Paris . The book begins with a description of his progress from Aleppo to İskenderun , Latakia , Tripoli , Beirut , Jaffa , Alexandria , Cairo , and then back to Alexandria from which he had boarded a ship to Marseille , where he arrived in October 1866 . The Arab cities had inspired in him revulsion and indifference , except Alexandria and Cairo , where Ismail Pasha had already begun modernization projects . He had then travelled through France , with a stopover in Lyon before ending up in Paris . Marrash was fascinated by France , and by Paris the most ; everything he described in his account , from the Paris Exhibition of 1867 to gas lighting in the streets , served to praise the accomplishments of Western civilization . In Mashhad al @-@ <unk> ( " The Witnessing of the Stages of Human Life " ) , published in 1870 , Marrash would again compare the East and the West , writing that " while the East sank deeper into darkness , the West embraced light " . The optimism he had formerly expressed about the first reform currents under the reign of Sultan Abdülaziz in the Ottoman Empire gave way to pessimism in Mashhad al @-@ <unk> , as he realized these reforms were superficial and that those he had hoped for would not soon come into being . Yet , in Durr al @-@ <unk> fi <unk> 'ib al @-@ <unk> ( Pearl Shells in Relating Strange Coincidences ) , which he published two years later , he depicted the Lebanese social life of his day and criticised the blind imitation of Western customs and the use of the French language in everyday life . 
 Throughout his life , Marrash composed many essays about science ( especially mathematics ) , and about education , a subject which mattered a lot to him ; indeed , he wrote in Ghabat al @-@ haqq that " without the education of the mind , man is a mindless beast " . He also wrote many articles in the popular press ; in those published in Butrus al @-@ <unk> 's journal al @-@ Jinan , he showed himself favourable to women 's education , which he restricted however to reading , writing , and a little bit of arithmetic , geography and grammar . In an 1872 issue of al @-@ Jinan , he wrote that it is not necessary for a woman " to act like a man , neglect her domestic and family duties , or that she should consider herself superior to the man " ; he nonetheless closely followed his sister 's studies . Marrash also condemned Arab men 's severe treatment of their wives and daughters . In his later works , he tried to demonstrate the existence of God and of the divine law ; the Sharia , as he conceived it , was not restricted to the sphere of the Islamic law alone . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Marrash often included poems in his works , written in <unk> and <unk> forms according to the occasion . Shmuel Moreh has stated that Marrash tried to introduce " a revolution in diction , themes , metaphor and imagery in modern Arabic poetry " , sometimes even mocking conventional poetic themes . In the introduction to his poetry book Mir 'at al @-@ <unk> ' ( The Mirror of the Beautiful One ) , which was first published in 1872 , Marrash rejected even the traditional genres of Arabic poetry , particularly panegyrics and lampoons . His use of conventional diction for new ideas marked the rise of a new stage in Arabic poetry which was carried on by the <unk> . Shmuel Moreh has also considered some passages from Ghabat al @-@ haqq and <unk> Baris to be prose poetry , while Salma Khadra Jayyusi has described his prosaic writing as " often Romantic in tone , rising sometimes to poetic heights , declamatory , vivid , colourful and musical " , calling it the first example of poetic prose in modern Arabic literature . 
 Khalil Gibran was a great admirer of Marrash , whose works he had read at al @-@ <unk> school in Beirut . According to Shmuel Moreh , Gibran 's own works echo Marrash 's style and " many of [ his ] ideas on enslavement , education , women 's liberation , truth , the natural goodness of man , and the corrupted morals of society " . Khalil Hawi has referred to Marrash 's aforementioned philosophy of universal love as having left a deep impression on Gibran . Moreover , Khalil Hawi has stated that many of Marrash 's recurring expressions became stock images for Arab writers of the 20th century : he has mentioned , for example , " the valleys of mental contemplation " , " the wings of thoughts " , " <unk> and dreams " , " the veils of history " , " the Kingdom of the Spirit " , " the nymphs of the forest , the spring and the dawn " , " golden diadems " , " the jewels of light " , " the storms of days and nights " , and " the smoke of revenge and the mist of anger " . Poet and journalist Khalil <unk> dedicated poems to Marrash and others of his contemporaries .

 = = History = = 
 = = = Before the merger of the Boosey and Hawkes companies = = = 
 Boosey & Hawkes was founded in 1930 through the merger of two respected music companies , Boosey & Company and Hawkes & Son . 
 The Boosey family was of Franco – Flemish origin . Boosey & Company traces its roots back to John Boosey , a bookseller in London in the 1760s – 1770s . His son Thomas continued the business at 4 Old Bond Street , and from 1819 the bookshop was called Boosey & Sons or T. & T. Boosey . 
 Thomas Boosey 's son , also named Thomas ( 1794 / 1795 – 1871 ) , set up a separate musical branch of the company known as T. Boosey & Co. and , in the latter part of the 19th century , Boosey & Company . This branch initially imported foreign music but soon began publishing in England the works of composers such as Johann Nepomuk Hummel , Saverio Mercadante and Gioachino Rossini , and subsequently important operas by Bellini , Donizetti and Verdi . Elgar and Vaughan Williams were among its later signings . The company also produced books : among its first publications was an English translation of Johann Nikolaus <unk> 's book Life of J.S. Bach ( 1820 ) . The company was seriously affected by the House of Lords ' decision in Boosey v. Jeffreys ( 1854 ) which deprived English publishers of many of their foreign copyrights . 
 Boosey & Company diversified into manufacturing woodwind instruments in 1851 , collaborating in 1856 with flautist R.S. Pratten ( 1846 – 1936 ) to develop new designs for flutes . The firm bought over the business of Henry Distin in 1868 , allowing it to begin making brass instruments . Among its achievements was the widely acclaimed design for compensating valves developed by David James <unk> in 1874 . The company also commenced production of string instruments . 
 The company capitalised on the increasing popularity of the ballad by focusing its publishing activities on them . To promote sales , John Boosey ( <unk> – 1893 ) , son of Thomas Jr . , established the London Ballad Concerts in 1867 at St. James 's Hall and later at Queen 's Hall when it opened in 1893 . Clara Butt , John Sims Reeves and Charles W. Clark performed at these concerts , and its successes included Arthur Sullivan 's " The Lost Chord " ( 1877 ) and Stephen Adams ' " The Holy City " . The company began emphasising educational music from about the end of the 19th century . 
 In 1874 Boosey & Company moved into offices at 295 Regent Street , where the business was to stay for the next 131 years . In 1892 , Boosey & Company opened an office in New York which still exists today . The business eventually owned half of Regent Street , and at the time of the merger was managed by Leslie Boosey ( 1887 – 1979 ) . 
 Hawkes & Son ( later Rivière & Hawkes ) , a rival to Boosey & Company , was founded in 1865 by William Henry Hawkes selling orchestral sheet music . The company also made musical instruments and spare parts such as clarinet reeds , and by 1925 Hawkes had set up an instrument factory in Edgware , North London . The business , which was particularly known for brass and military band music , was eventually inherited by Ralph Hawkes ( 1898 – 1950 ) . 
 = = = After the merger = = = 
 Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes met in the 1920s when they were on the Board of the Performing Right Society , and saw an opportunity to go into business together . They formed Boosey & Hawkes in October 1930 through a merger of their respective businesses . Hawkes & Son moved from its office in Denman Street to join the Boosey staff at 295 Regent Street . 
 The 1938 Anschluss — the annexation of Austria into Greater Germany by the Nazi regime — led to the Nazification of Viennese publishing house Universal Edition . Boosey & Hawkes seized the opportunity to sign up composers Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály , and also rescued Universal 's Jewish staff , who later played an important role in developing the company . One such employee in particular , Ernst Roth , facilitated the signing of Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky , and was instrumental in the production of Strauss 's Vier letzte Lieder ( Four Last Songs ) ( 1948 ; premièred 1950 ) and Stravinsky 's The Rake 's Progress ( premièred 1951 ) . Another significant figure from Vienna who occupied an editorial role was composer Arnold Schoenberg 's pupil Erwin Stein , and after the war the composer Leopold Spinner , a pupil of Anton Webern , was also on the editorial staff . Stein was instrumental in founding the modern @-@ music journal Tempo in 1939 , which began as Boosey & Hawkes ' own newsletter but later became a more independent publication . 
 By the time World War II broke out in 1939 , Boosey & Hawkes had also signed Benjamin Britten and Aaron Copland . It was Ralph Hawkes who championed Britten when he was still relatively unknown , often against the rest of the board of directors , until the première on 7 June 1945 of Peter Grimes , which was a critical and popular success . Sheet music sales soared during the War , enabling Boosey & Hawkes to buy Editions Russes which held the rights to the most valuable works of Prokofiev , Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky . The company also purchased the lease of the Royal Opera House in London in 1944 , rescuing it from becoming a permanent dance hall and providing a venue for world @-@ class ballet and opera in the capital . 
 By 1950 , Boosey & Hawkes was a leading international music company with an extensive catalogue of serious composers and offices in Bonn , Johannesburg , New York , Paris , Toronto and Sydney . However , from the late 1940s , strains had begun to appear in the relationship between Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes , and this led to factions supporting each man forming in the company . It was discovered that Hawkes had borrowed capital of £ 100 @,@ 000 during the war without the permission of the exchange control authorities , and Boosey was forced to clear up the situation at great personal cost . Hawkes secretly wanted to buy out the music publishing side of the business and manage it from New York , leaving Boosey in London with the musical instrument business which Hawkes found dull . However , he died suddenly on 8 September 1950 , and representation of his faction was taken over by his flamboyant but unreliable brother Geoffrey who spent much of the company 's money on ventures such as the manufacture of mouth organs and ovens , which failed . Geoffrey Hawkes also sold shares in the company to fund his philandering , to the point that the company was forced to go public to raise cash . Leslie Boosey allowed Geoffrey his turn as chairman , but within two years the profitable company was on the brink of insolvency and Geoffrey Hawkes died of leukaemia in 1961 . 
 During these difficult years , Boosey was supported by his trusted managing director , Ernst Roth . However , Roth later regarded the Boosey family as ineffectual and parochial . In the early 1960s , Roth forced Boosey 's sons Anthony and Simon out of the company , and prevented his youngest son , Nigel , from even joining , allegedly at the behest of Benjamin Britten . Roth and Boosey also had differences over Britten 's influence over the company . Roth regarded Britten as a gifted local musician , rather than a true genius like Roth 's friends Strauss and Stravinsky . Boosey realised how valuable Britten was to the company , and agreed to Britten 's request to divide the company into instruments and publishing . However , Britten humiliated Boosey by preventing him from chairing the music publishing board Boosey had established at Britten 's request . In 1963 , Britten also managed to get Boosey & Hawkes to employ Donald Mitchell to find new , young composers for the company . Angered by the sway Britten had over Boosey , Roth fired Mitchell within a year . Mitchell later set up Faber Music for book publisher Faber and Faber with the assistance of Britten and the blessing of T. S. Eliot . 
 Boosey retired from the company in 1964 , and died without an obituary in 1979 . Although he had been awarded with the Légion d 'honneur by France , his achievements were mostly unrecognised in the UK . However , a large number of composers and their estates continue to benefit from his pioneering work in rights and royalty collection . In addition , every two years the Royal Philharmonic Society and the Performing Right Society honour individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the furtherance of contemporary music in Britain with the Leslie Boosey Award . The award is given to those who work " backstage " , such as administrators , broadcasters , educationalists , programmers , publishers and representatives from the recording industry . 
 Some time during the late 1960s or early 1970s Boosey & Hawkes bought out The Salvation Army Brass Instrument Factory in North London . They continued for some years to manufacture instruments with The Salvation Army name and crest on them such as The Bandmaster cornets . 
 Boosey & Hawkes ' musical instruments division was gradually scaled down from the mid @-@ 1970s as it became less viable to have such an extensive range of products . Various lines were outsourced and sold off . By the time of the closure of the Edgware factory in 2001 , brass instruments were the only thriving part of the instrument range . Production was moved to Watford , Hertfordshire , and the instruments rebranded Besson . 
 It took nearly 20 years for Boosey & Hawkes to regain the leading position in the international music scene that it has today . It claims to be the largest specialist classical music publisher in the world . 
 = = The company today = = 
 In 2001 , Boosey & Hawkes was put up for sale after accounting irregularities were discovered in its Chicago instrument @-@ distribution business , leading to £ 13m worth of sales being written off , a plummeting share price , and the company 's near @-@ bankruptcy . It was eventually bought by venture capitalists HgCapital in 2003 for £ 40 million . 
 On 11 February 2003 , Boosey & Hawkes sold its musical instrument division , which included clarinet maker Buffet Crampon and guitar manufacturer Höfner , to The Music Group , a company formed by rescue buyout specialists Rutland Fund Management , for £ 33 @.@ 2 million . An archive of musical instruments manufactured or collected by the company throughout its history was passed to the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill , South London . 
 In September 2005 the company was again offered for sale by HgCapital which announced that it was seeking between £ 60 and £ 80 million . One of the interested buyers was Elevation Partners , a private equity firm which counts U2 lead singer Bono as a partner and managing director . Despite offers of about £ 115 million from a number of parties , the sale was later cancelled in November 2005 . In April 2008 , Boosey & Hawkes was bought by the Imagem Music Group . 
 Today , partly due to the foresight or business acumen of Ralph Hawkes , the company owns the copyrights or agencies to much major 20th @-@ century music , including works by Bartók , Leonard Bernstein , Britten ( notably all his output between 1938 and 1963 ) , Copland , Kodály , Prokofiev , Rachmaninoff , Richard Strauss and Stravinsky . It also publishes many prominent contemporary composers , such as John Adams , Louis Andriessen , Sir Harrison Birtwistle , <unk> Chin , Michael Daugherty , Peter Maxwell Davies , Henryk Górecki , Heinz Karl Gruber , Robin Holloway , Magnus Lindberg , James MacMillan , Olga Neuwirth , Kurt Schwertsik and Mark @-@ Anthony Turnage . The company 's New York branch has developed its own catalogue emphasising the works of American composers , including Elliott Carter , David Del Tredici , Walter Piston , Ned Rorem and Steve Reich . 
 295 Regent Street , which was the home of Boosey & Company since 1874 and of Boosey & Hawkes ' publishing business and music shop from 1930 , was finally given up by the company in 2005 which then relocated to Aldwych House . Boosey & Hawkes Music Shop claims to have the UK 's largest selection of printed music from all publishers , and operates a worldwide mail order service . 
 The company had a major division , <unk> , that commissioned and produced music for radio , television and advertising jingles , and the administration of copyrights owned by media companies . This has now been split into commercial synchronisation and production music departments , both under the Imagem name . Its Cavendish Production Music Library provides ready @-@ made production music for television , radio and audio @-@ visual use . 
 The Boosey & Hawkes group has branches in five countries on four continents , including companies in Germany ( Bote & Bock GmbH & Co . KG and Anton J. Benjamin GmbH ) , the UK ( Boosey & Hawkes Music Publishers Ltd . ) and the USA ( Boosey & Hawkes , Inc . ) . In North America , Boosey & Hawkes ' print sales catalogue is distributed by the Hal Leonard Corporation . 
 Boosey & Hawkes launched its Online Scores service in 2011 , allowing customers to view full scores of works in its catalogue .

 The company was lampooned by The Goon Show as " <unk> and <unk> " in their episode , " <unk> Strikes Britain " , as well as by musical parodist Peter Schickele who named one of the friends of fictional composer <unk> Bach Jonathan " <unk> " Hawkes . Somewhat more recondite was the punning reference delivered in one of Gerard Hoffnung 's parody concerts : " If Boosey 's will Hawk it , Schott 's will Tippett " ( from Punkt <unk> at Hoffnung Interplanetary Music Festival with John Amis , Royal Festival Hall , 21 and 22 November 1958 )

Philips praised " Lose Yourself " , opining that it was an " excellent , extremely entertaining climax to this season 's two main plot lines .

Vince has always been a little bit shallow , but never to this extent . Vince never told his friends that they needed him more than he needed them before . And while it 's definitely true to a certain extent , part of Vince 's charm was that he never threw that back in their faces . " In concurrence , TV Fanatic 's Eric Hochberger expressed that " Lose Yourself " was a " stellar season finale with plenty of unanswered cliffhangers for next season .

 Survivor Series ( 2004 ) was the 18th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) . It was presented by Microsoft 's Xbox and took place on November 14 , 2004 , at the Gund Arena in Cleveland , Ohio and starred talent from both the Raw and SmackDown ! brands . 
 The main match on the Raw brand was a 4 on 4 Survivor Series match , a type of elimination match , between Team Orton ( Randy Orton , Chris Benoit , Chris Jericho , and Maven ) and Team Triple H ( Triple H , Edge , Batista , and Snitsky ) , which Team Orton won after Orton last eliminated Triple H. The predominant match on the SmackDown ! brand was John " Bradshaw " Layfield ( JBL ) versus Booker T for the WWE Championship , which JBL won by pinfall after hitting Booker with the title belt . The primary match on the undercard was a 4 on 4 Survivor Series match between Team Guerrero ( Eddie Guerrero , The Big Show , Rob Van Dam , and John Cena ) and Team Angle ( Kurt Angle , Carlito , Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak ) , which Team Guerrero won after Big Show last eliminated Angle . 
 Several of the existing feuds carried on following the event .

John " Bradshaw " Layfield also continued his feud with Booker T , defeating him , Eddie Guerrero , and The Undertaker at Armageddon . Following the event , Carlito sustained a legitimate injury and lost the WWE United States Championship to John Cena , with whom he was in a storyline . 
 = = Background = = 
 The event featured seven professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWE script writers . The matches featured wrestlers portraying their characters in planned storylines that took place before , during and after the event . All wrestlers were from one of the WWE 's brands – SmackDown and Raw – the two storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees . 
 The main feud on the Raw brand was between Team Orton ( Randy Orton , Chris Benoit , Chris Jericho and Maven ) and Team Triple H ( Triple H , Edge , Batista and Snitsky ) . On the October 25 , 2004 episode of Raw , Evolution ( Triple H , Ric Flair and Batista ) were put in charge of Raw , after General Manager Eric Bischoff took the night off . Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice ; Flair wanted a rematch with Orton , as he lost a Steel Cage match to Orton at Taboo Tuesday . Orton accepted Flair 's challenge , with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series . Orton , however , lost the match after interference by Triple H , giving the win to Flair , so Orton did not receive an opportunity for the World Heavyweight title . On the November 1 episode of Raw , General Manager Eric Bischoff scheduled a traditional 8 @-@ man elimination tag team match between Orton , Jericho , Maven and Benoit and Triple H , Batista , Edge and <unk> at Survivor Series . The winning team at Survivor Series would be granted absolute control of running Raw for a month .

 = = Aftermath = = 
 As Team Orton ( Randy Orton , Chris Benoit , Chris Jericho and Maven ) defeated Team Triple H ( Triple H , Edge , Batista and Snitsky ) at Survivor Series , they were given the opportunity to be in charge of Raw for a month ; On the November 29 episode of Raw , Randy Orton was in charge and scheduled a World Heavyweight title Battle Royal . WWE Chairman Vince McMahon , however , overruled the Battle Royal match and instead booked Triple H to face the winner of the Battle Royal . The battle royal match saw Chris Benoit and Edge , as the final two participants , going over the top rope at the same time , ostensibly ending the match . Orton , acting as General Manager , booked a Triple Threat match between Benoit , Edge , and Triple H for the World Heavyweight title . The match resulted in Benoit applying the Crossface on Edge , only for Edge to manage to roll Benoit over , while the Crossface was still locked in , causing Benoit ’ s shoulders to touch the mat . The referee began counting , which moments later led to Edge to submit to the maneuver . The following week , with Chris Jericho in charge , Vince McMahon vacated the World Heavyweight title , concluding the match ended in a tie . On the December 13 episode of Raw , Eric Bischoff , who had resumed his position as General Manager , scheduled an Elimination Chamber match between Triple H , Edge , Benoit , Chris Jericho , Orton and Batista at New Year 's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight title .

 = Atmosphere of Jupiter = 
 The atmosphere of Jupiter is the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System . It is mostly made of molecular hydrogen and helium in roughly solar proportions ; other chemical compounds are present only in small amounts and include methane , ammonia , hydrogen sulfide and water . Although water is thought to reside deep in the atmosphere , its directly measured concentration is very low . The nitrogen , sulfur , and noble gas abundances in Jupiter 's atmosphere exceed solar values by a factor of about three . 
 The atmosphere of Jupiter lacks a clear lower boundary and gradually transitions into the liquid interior of the planet . From lowest to highest , the atmospheric layers are the troposphere , stratosphere , thermosphere and exosphere . Each layer has characteristic temperature gradients . The lowest layer , the troposphere , has a complicated system of clouds and hazes , comprising layers of ammonia , ammonium hydrosulfide and water . The upper ammonia clouds visible at Jupiter 's surface are organized in a dozen zonal bands parallel to the equator and are bounded by powerful zonal atmospheric flows ( winds ) known as jets . The bands alternate in color : the dark bands are called belts , while light ones are called zones . Zones , which are colder than belts , correspond to upwellings , while belts mark descending air . The zones ' lighter color is believed to result from ammonia ice ; what gives the belts their darker colors is not known with certainty . The origins of the banded structure and jets are not well understood , though two models exist . The shallow model holds that they are surface phenomena overlaying a stable interior . In the deep model , the bands and jets are just surface manifestations of deep circulation in Jupiter 's mantle of molecular hydrogen , which is organized into cylinders . 
 The Jovian atmosphere shows a wide range of active phenomena , including band instabilities , vortices ( cyclones and anticyclones ) , storms and lightning . The vortices reveal themselves as large red , white or brown spots ( ovals ) . The largest two spots are the Great Red Spot ( GRS ) and Oval BA , which is also red . These two and most of the other large spots are anticyclonic . Smaller anticyclones tend to be white . Vortices are thought to be relatively shallow structures with depths not exceeding several hundred kilometers . Located in the southern hemisphere , the GRS is the largest known vortex in the Solar System . It could engulf two or three Earths and has existed for at least three hundred years . Oval BA , south of GRS , is a red spot a third the size of GRS that formed in 2000 from the merging of three white ovals . 
 Jupiter has powerful storms , often accompanied by lightning strikes . The storms are a result of moist convection in the atmosphere connected to the evaporation and condensation of water . They are sites of strong upward motion of the air , which leads to the formation of bright and dense clouds . The storms form mainly in belt regions . The lightning strikes on Jupiter are hundreds of times more powerful than those seen on Earth . However , there are so few , that the amount of lightning activity is comparable to Earth . 
 = = Vertical structure = = 
 The atmosphere of Jupiter is classified into four layers , by increasing altitude : the troposphere , stratosphere , thermosphere and exosphere . Unlike the Earth 's atmosphere , Jupiter 's lacks a mesosphere . Jupiter does not have a solid surface , and the lowest atmospheric layer , the troposphere , smoothly transitions into the planet 's fluid interior . This is a result of having temperatures and the pressures well above those of the critical points for hydrogen and helium , meaning that there is no sharp boundary between gas and liquid phases . Hydrogen becomes a supercritical fluid at a pressure of around 12 bar . 
 Since the lower boundary of the atmosphere is ill @-@ defined , the pressure level of 10 bars , at an altitude of about 90 km below 1 bar with a temperature of around 340 K , is commonly treated as the base of the troposphere . In scientific literature , the 1 bar pressure level is usually chosen as a zero point for altitudes — a " surface " of Jupiter . As with Earth , the top atmospheric layer , the exosphere , does not have a well defined upper boundary . The density gradually decreases until it smoothly transitions into the interplanetary medium approximately 5 @,@ 000 km above the " surface " . 
 The vertical temperature variations in the Jovian atmosphere are similar to those of the atmosphere of Earth . The temperature of the troposphere decreases with height until it reaches a minimum at the tropopause , which is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere . On Jupiter , the tropopause is approximately 50 km above the visible clouds ( or 1 bar level ) , where the pressure and temperature are about 0 @.@ 1 bar and 110 K. In the stratosphere , the temperatures rise to about 200 K at the transition into the thermosphere , at an altitude and pressure of around 320 km and 1 μbar . In the thermosphere , temperatures continue to rise , eventually reaching 1000 K at about 1000 km , where pressure is about 1 nbar . 
 Jupiter 's troposphere contains a complicated cloud structure . The upper clouds , located in the pressure range 0 @.@ 6 – 0 @.@ 9 bar , are made of ammonia ice . Below these ammonia ice clouds , denser clouds made of ammonium hydrosulfide or ammonium sulfide ( between 1 – 2 bar ) and water ( 3 – 7 bar ) are thought to exist . There are no methane clouds as the temperatures are too high for it to condense . The water clouds form the densest layer of clouds and have the strongest influence on the dynamics of the atmosphere . This is a result of the higher condensation heat of water and higher water abundance as compared to the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide ( oxygen is a more abundant chemical element than either nitrogen or sulfur ) . Various tropospheric ( at 200 – 500 mbar ) and stratospheric ( at 10 – 100 mbar ) haze layers reside above the main cloud layers . The latter are made from condensed heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or hydrazine , which are generated in the upper stratosphere ( 1 – 100 μbar ) from methane under the influence of the solar ultraviolet radiation ( UV ) . The methane abundance relative to molecular hydrogen in the stratosphere is about 10 − 4 , while the abundance ratio of other light hydrocarbons , like ethane and acetylene , to molecular hydrogen is about 10 − 6 . 
 Jupiter 's thermosphere is located at pressures lower than 1 μbar and demonstrates such phenomena as airglow , polar aurorae and X @-@ ray emissions . Within it lie layers of increased electron and ion density that form the ionosphere . The high temperatures prevalent in the thermosphere ( 800 – 1000 K ) have not been fully explained yet ; existing models predict a temperature no higher than about 400 K. They may be caused by absorption of high @-@ energy solar radiation ( UV or X @-@ ray ) , by heating from the charged particles precipitating from the Jovian magnetosphere , or by dissipation of upward @-@ propagating gravity waves . The thermosphere and exosphere at the poles and at low latitudes emit X @-@ rays , which were first observed by the Einstein Observatory in 1983 . The energetic particles coming from Jupiter 's magnetosphere create bright auroral ovals , which encircle the poles . Unlike their terrestrial analogs , which appear only during magnetic storms , aurorae are permanent features of Jupiter 's atmosphere . The thermosphere was the first place outside the Earth where the trihydrogen cation ( H + 
 3 ) was discovered . This ion emits strongly in the mid @-@ infrared part of the spectrum , at wavelengths between 3 and 5 μm ; this is the main cooling mechanism of the thermosphere . 
 = = Chemical composition = = 
 The composition of Jupiter 's atmosphere is similar to that of the planet as a whole . Jupiter 's atmosphere is the most comprehensively understood of those of all the gas giants because it was observed directly by the Galileo atmospheric probe when it entered the Jovian atmosphere on December 7 , 1995 . Other sources of information about Jupiter 's atmospheric composition include the Infrared Space Observatory ( ISO ) , the Galileo and Cassini orbiters , and Earth @-@ based observations . 
 The two main constituents of the Jovian atmosphere are molecular hydrogen ( H 
 2 ) and helium . The helium abundance is 0 @.@ 157 ± 0 @.@ 0036 relative to molecular hydrogen by number of molecules , and its mass fraction is 0 @.@ 234 ± 0 @.@ 005 , which is slightly lower than the Solar System 's primordial value . The reason for this low abundance is not entirely understood , but some of the helium may have condensed into the core of Jupiter . This condensation is likely to be in the form of helium rain : as hydrogen turns into the metallic state at depths of more than 10 @,@ 000 km , helium separates from it forming droplets which , being denser than the metallic hydrogen , descend towards the core . This can also explain the severe depletion of neon ( see Table ) , an element that easily dissolves in helium droplets and would be transported in them towards the core as well . 
 The atmosphere contains various simple compounds such as water , methane ( CH4 ) , hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , ammonia ( NH3 ) and phosphine ( <unk> ) . Their abundances in the deep ( below 10 bar ) troposphere imply that the atmosphere of Jupiter is enriched in the elements carbon , nitrogen , sulfur and possibly oxygen by factor of 2 – 4 relative to the Sun . The noble gases argon , krypton and xenon also appear in abundance relative to solar levels ( see table ) , while neon is scarcer . Other chemical compounds such as <unk> ( <unk> ) and germane ( GeH4 ) are present only in trace amounts . The upper atmosphere of Jupiter contains small amounts of simple hydrocarbons such as ethane , acetylene , and diacetylene , which form from methane under the influence of the solar ultraviolet radiation and charged particles coming from Jupiter 's magnetosphere . The carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide and water present in the upper atmosphere are thought to originate from impacting comets , such as Shoemaker @-@ Levy 9 . The water cannot come from the troposphere because the cold tropopause acts like a cold trap , effectively preventing water from rising to the stratosphere ( see Vertical structure above ) . 
 <unk> and spacecraft @-@ based measurements have led to improved knowledge of the isotopic ratios in Jupiter 's atmosphere . As of July 2003 , the accepted value for the deuterium abundance is 2 @.@ 25 ± 0 @.@ 35 × 10 − 5 , which probably represents the primordial value in the protosolar nebula that gave birth to the Solar System . The ratio of nitrogen isotopes in the Jovian atmosphere , 15N to 14N , is 2 @.@ 3 × 10 − 3 , a third lower than that in the Earth 's atmosphere ( 3 @.@ 5 × 10 − 3 ) . The latter discovery is especially significant since the previous theories of Solar System formation considered the terrestrial value for the ratio of nitrogen isotopes to be primordial . 
 = = Zones , belts and jets = = 
 The visible surface of Jupiter is divided into several bands parallel to the equator . There are two types of bands : lightly colored zones and relatively dark belts . The wider Equatorial Zone ( EZ ) extends between latitudes of approximately 7 ° S to 7 ° N. Above and below the EZ , the North and South Equatorial belts ( NEB and SEB ) extend to 18 ° N and 18 ° S , respectively . Farther from the equator lie the North and South Tropical zones ( <unk> and <unk> ) . The alternating pattern of belts and zones continues until the polar regions at approximately 50 degrees latitude , where their visible appearance becomes somewhat muted . The basic belt @-@ zone structure probably extends well towards the poles , reaching at least to 80 ° North or South . 
 The difference in the appearance between zones and belts is caused by differences in the opacity of the clouds . Ammonia concentration is higher in zones , which leads to the appearance of denser clouds of ammonia ice at higher altitudes , which in turn leads to their lighter color . On the other hand , in belts clouds are thinner and are located at lower altitudes . The upper troposphere is colder in zones and warmer in belts . The exact nature of chemicals that make Jovian zones and bands so colorful is not known , but they may include complicated compounds of sulfur , phosphorus and carbon . 
 The Jovian bands are bounded by zonal atmospheric flows ( winds ) , called jets . The eastward ( prograde ) jets are found at the transition from zones to belts ( going away from the equator ) , whereas westward ( retrograde ) jets mark the transition from belts to zones . Such flow velocity patterns mean that the zonal winds decrease in belts and increase in zones from the equator to the pole . Therefore , wind shear in belts is cyclonic , while in zones it is anticyclonic . The EZ is an exception to this rule , showing a strong eastward ( prograde ) jet and has a local minimum of the wind speed exactly at the equator . The jet speeds are high on Jupiter , reaching more than 100 m / s . These speeds correspond to ammonia clouds located in the pressure range 0 @.@ 7 – 1 bar . The prograde jets are generally more powerful than the retrograde jets . The vertical extent of jets is not known . They decay over two to three scale heights above the clouds , while below the cloud level , winds increase slightly and then remain constant down to at least 22 bar — the maximum operational depth reached by the Galileo Probe . 
 The origin of Jupiter 's banded structure is not completely clear , though it may be similar to that driving the Earth 's Hadley cells . The simplest interpretation is that zones are sites of atmospheric upwelling , whereas belts are manifestations of downwelling . When air enriched in ammonia rises in zones , it expands and cools , forming high and dense clouds . In belts , however , the air descends , warming adiabatically , and white ammonia clouds evaporate , revealing lower , darker clouds . The location and width of bands , speed and location of jets on Jupiter are remarkably stable , having changed only slightly between 1980 and 2000 . One example of change is a decrease of the speed of the strongest eastward jet located at the boundary between the North Tropical zone and North Temperate belts at 23 ° N. However bands vary in coloration and intensity over time ( see below ) . These variations were first observed in the early seventeenth century . 
 = = = Specific bands = = = 
 The belts and zones that divide Jupiter 's atmosphere each have their own names and unique characteristics . They begin below the North and South Polar Regions , which extend from the poles to roughly 40 – 48 ° N / S. These bluish @-@ gray regions are usually featureless . 
 The North North Temperate Region rarely shows more detail than the polar regions , due to limb darkening , foreshortening , and the general diffuseness of features . However , the North @-@ North Temperate Belt ( <unk> ) is the northernmost distinct belt , though it occasionally disappears . Disturbances tend to be minor and short @-@ lived . The North @-@ North Temperate Zone ( <unk> ) is perhaps more prominent , but also generally quiet . Other minor belts and zones in the region are occasionally observed . 
 The North Temperate Region is part of a latitudinal region easily observable from Earth , and thus has a superb record of observation . It also features the strongest prograde jet stream on the planet — a westerly current that forms the southern boundary of the North Temperate Belt ( NTB ) . The NTB fades roughly once a decade ( this was the case during the Voyager encounters ) , making the North Temperate Zone ( NTZ ) apparently merge into the North Tropical Zone ( NTropZ ) . Other times , the NTZ is divided by a narrow belt into northern and southern components . 
 The North Tropical Region is composed of the NTropZ and the North Equatorial Belt ( NEB ) . The NTropZ is generally stable in coloration , changing in tint only in tandem with activity on the NTB 's southern jet stream . Like the NTZ , it too is sometimes divided by a narrow band , the <unk> . On rare occasions , the southern NTropZ plays host to " Little Red Spots " . As the name suggests , these are northern equivalents of the Great Red Spot . Unlike the GRS , they tend to occur in pairs and are always short @-@ lived , lasting a year on average ; one was present during the Pioneer 10 encounter . 
 The NEB is one of the most active belts on the planet . It is characterized by anticyclonic white ovals and cyclonic " barges " ( also known as " brown ovals " ) , with the former usually forming farther north than the latter ; as in the NTropZ , most of these features are relatively short @-@ lived . Like the South Equatorial Belt ( SEB ) , the NEB has sometimes dramatically faded and " revived " . The timescale of these changes is about 25 years . 
 The Equatorial Region ( EZ ) is one of the more stable regions of the planet , in latitude and in activity . The northern edge of the EZ hosts spectacular plumes that trail southwest from the NEB , which are bounded by dark , warm ( in infrared ) features known as festoons ( hot spots ) . Though the southern boundary of the EZ is usually quiescent , observations from the late 19th into the early 20th century show that this pattern was then reversed relative to today . The EZ varies considerably in coloration , from pale to an ochre , or even coppery hue ; it is occasionally divided by an Equatorial Band ( EB ) . Features in the EZ move roughly 390 km / h relative to the other latitudes . 
 The South Tropical Region includes the South Equatorial Belt ( SEB ) and the South Tropical Zone . It is by far the most active region the planet , as it is home to its strongest retrograde jet stream . The SEB is usually the broadest , darkest belt on Jupiter ; it is sometimes split by a zone ( the <unk> ) , and can fade entirely every 3 to 15 years before reappearing in what is known as an SEB Revival cycle . A period of weeks or months following the belt 's disappearance , a white spot forms and erupts dark brownish material which is stretched into a new belt by Jupiter 's winds . The belt most recently disappeared in May 2010 . Another characteristic of the SEB is a long train of cyclonic disturbances following the Great Red Spot . Like the NTropZ , the <unk> is one of the most prominent zones on the planet ; not only does it contain the GRS , but it is occasionally rent by a South Tropical Disturbance ( <unk> ) , a division of the zone that can be very long @-@ lived ; the most famous one lasted from 1901 to 1939 . 
 The South Temperate Region , or South Temperate Belt ( STB ) , is yet another dark , prominent belt , more so than the NTB ; until March 2000 , its most famous features were the long @-@ lived white ovals BC , DE , and FA , which have since merged to form Oval BA ( " Red Jr . " ) . The ovals were part of South Temperate Zone , but they extended into STB partially blocking it . The STB has occasionally faded , apparently due to complex interactions between the white ovals and the GRS . The appearance of the South Temperate Zone ( STZ ) — the zone in which the white ovals originated — is highly variable . 
 There are other features on Jupiter that are either temporary or difficult to observe from Earth . The South South Temperate Region is harder to discern even than the <unk> ; its detail is subtle and can only be studied well by large telescopes or spacecraft . Many zones and belts are more transient in nature and are not always visible . These include the Equatorial band ( EB ) , North Equatorial belt zone ( <unk> , a white zone within the belt ) and South Equatorial belt zone ( <unk> ) . Belts are also occasionally split by a sudden disturbance . When a disturbance divides a normally singular belt or zone , an N or an S is added to indicate whether the component is the northern or southern one ; e.g. , NEB ( N ) and NEB ( S ) . 
 = = Dynamics = = 
 Circulation in Jupiter 's atmosphere is markedly different from that in the atmosphere of Earth . The interior of Jupiter is fluid and lacks any solid surface . Therefore , convection may occur throughout the planet 's outer molecular envelope . As of 2008 , a comprehensive theory of the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere has not been developed . Any such theory needs to explain the following facts : the existence of narrow stable bands and jets that are symmetric relative to Jupiter 's equator , the strong prograde jet observed at the equator , the difference between zones and belts , and the origin and persistence of large vortices such as the Great Red Spot . 
 The theories regarding the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere can be broadly divided into two classes : shallow and deep . The former hold that the observed circulation is largely confined to a thin outer ( weather ) layer of the planet , which overlays the stable interior . The latter hypothesis postulates that the observed atmospheric flows are only a surface manifestation of deeply rooted circulation in the outer molecular envelope of Jupiter . As both theories have their own successes and failures , many planetary scientists think that the true theory will include elements of both models . 
 = = = Shallow models = = = 
 The first attempts to explain Jovian atmospheric dynamics date back to the 1960s . They were partly based on terrestrial meteorology , which had become well developed by that time . Those shallow models assumed that the jets on Jupiter are driven by small scale turbulence , which is in turn maintained by moist convection in the outer layer of the atmosphere ( above the water clouds ) . The moist convection is a phenomenon related to the condensation and evaporation of water and is one of the major drivers of terrestrial weather . The production of the jets in this model is related to a well @-@ known property of two dimensional turbulence — the so @-@ called inverse cascade , in which small turbulent structures ( vortices ) merge to form larger ones . The finite size of the planet means that the cascade can not produce structures larger than some characteristic scale , which for Jupiter is called the <unk> scale . Its existence is connected to production of Rossby waves . This process works as follows : when the largest turbulent structures reach a certain size , the energy begins to flow into Rossby waves instead of larger structures , and the inverse cascade stops . Since on the spherical rapidly rotating planet the dispersion relation of the Rossby waves is anisotropic , the <unk> scale in the direction parallel to the equator is larger than in the direction orthogonal to it . The ultimate result of the process described above is production of large scale elongated structures , which are parallel to the equator . The meridional extent of them appears to match the actual width of jets . Therefore , in shallow models vortices actually feed the jets and should disappear by merging into them . 
 While these weather – layer models can successfully explain the existence of a dozen narrow jets , they have serious problems . A glaring failure of the model is the prograde ( super @-@ rotating ) equatorial jet : with some rare exceptions shallow models produce a strong retrograde ( <unk> ) jet , contrary to observations . In addition , the jets tend to be unstable and can disappear over time . Shallow models cannot explain how the observed atmospheric flows on Jupiter violate stability criteria . More elaborated multilayer versions of weather – layer models produce more stable circulation , but many problems persist . Meanwhile , the Galileo Probe found that the winds on Jupiter extend well below the water clouds at 5 – 7 bar and do not show any evidence of decay down to 22 bar pressure level , which implies that circulation in the Jovian atmosphere may in fact be deep . 
 = = = Deep models = = = 
 The deep model was first proposed by <unk> in 1976 . His model was based on another well @-@ known feature of fluid mechanics , the Taylor – Proudman theorem . It holds that in any fast @-@ rotating barotropic ideal liquid , the flows are organized in a series of cylinders parallel to the rotational axis . The conditions of the theorem are probably met in the fluid Jovian interior . Therefore , the planet 's molecular hydrogen mantle may be divided into cylinders , each cylinder having a circulation independent of the others . Those latitudes where the cylinders ' outer and inner boundaries intersect with the visible surface of the planet correspond to the jets ; the cylinders themselves are observed as zones and belts . 
 The deep model easily explains the strong prograde jet observed at the equator of Jupiter ; the jets it produces are stable and do not obey the 2D stability criterion . However it has major difficulties ; it produces a very small number of broad jets , and realistic simulations of 3D flows are not possible as of 2008 , meaning that the simplified models used to justify deep circulation may fail to catch important aspects of the fluid dynamics within Jupiter . One model published in 2004 successfully reproduced the Jovian band @-@ jet structure . It assumed that the molecular hydrogen mantle is thinner than in all other models ; occupying only the outer 10 % of Jupiter 's radius . In standard models of the Jovian interior , the mantle comprises the outer 20 – 30 % . The driving of deep circulation is another problem . The deep flows can be caused both by shallow forces ( moist convection , for instance ) or by deep planet @-@ wide convection that transports heat out of the Jovian interior . Which of these mechanisms is more important is not clear yet . 
 = = = Internal heat = = = 
 As has been known since 1966 , Jupiter radiates much more heat than it receives from the Sun . It is estimated that the ratio between the power emitted by the planet and that absorbed from the Sun is 1 @.@ 67 ± 0 @.@ 09 . The internal heat flux from Jupiter is 5 @.@ 44 ± 0 @.@ 43 W / m2 , whereas the total emitted power is 335 ± 26 <unk> . The latter value is approximately equal to one billionth of the total power radiated by the Sun . This excess heat is mainly the primordial heat from the early phases of Jupiter 's formation , but may result in part from the precipitation of helium into the core . 
 The internal heat may be important for the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere . While Jupiter has a small obliquity of about 3 ° , and its poles receive much less solar radiation than its equator , the tropospheric temperatures do not change appreciably from the equator to poles . One explanation is that Jupiter 's convective interior acts like a thermostat , releasing more heat near the poles than in the equatorial region . This leads to a uniform temperature in the troposphere . While heat is transported from the equator to the poles mainly via the atmosphere on Earth , on Jupiter deep convection <unk> heat . The convection in the Jovian interior is thought to be driven mainly by the internal heat . 
 = = Discrete features = = 
 = = = Vortices = = = 
 The atmosphere of Jupiter is home to hundreds of vortices — circular rotating structures that , as in the Earth 's atmosphere , can be divided into two classes : cyclones and anticyclones . Cyclones rotate in the direction similar to the rotation of the planet ( counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern ) ; the anticyclones rotate in the reverse direction . However a major difference from the terrestrial atmosphere is that , in the Jovian atmosphere , anticyclones dominate over cyclones , as more than 90 % of vortices larger than 2000 km in diameter are anticyclones . The lifetime of vortices varies from several days to hundreds of years depending on their size . For instance , the average lifetime of anticyclones with diameters from 1000 to 6000 km is 1 – 3 years . Vortices have never been observed in the equatorial region of Jupiter ( within 10 ° of latitude ) , where they are unstable . As on any rapidly rotating planet , Jupiter 's anticyclones are high pressure centers , while cyclones are low pressure . 
 The anticyclones in Jupiter 's atmosphere are always confined within zones , where the wind speed increases in direction from the equator to the poles . They are usually bright and appear as white ovals . They can move in longitude , but stay at approximately the same latitude as they are unable to escape from the confining zone . The wind speeds at their periphery are about 100 m / s . Different anticyclones located in one zone tend to merge , when they approach each other . However Jupiter has two anticyclones that are somewhat different from all others . They are the Great Red Spot ( GRS ) and the Oval BA ; the latter formed only in 2000 . In contrast to white ovals , these structures are red , arguably due to dredging up of red material from the planet 's depths . On Jupiter the anticyclones usually form through merges of smaller structures including convective storms ( see below ) , although large ovals can result from the instability of jets . The latter was observed in 1938 – 1940 , when a few white ovals appeared as a result of instability of the southern temperate zone ; they later merged to form Oval BA . 
 In contrast to anticyclones , the Jovian cyclones tend to be small , dark and irregular structures . Some of the darker and more regular features are known as brown ovals ( or badges ) . However the existence of a few long – lived large cyclones has been suggested . In addition to compact cyclones , Jupiter has several large irregular filamentary patches , which demonstrate cyclonic rotation . One of them is located to the west of the GRS ( in its wake region ) in the southern equatorial belt . These patches are called cyclonic regions ( CR ) . The cyclones are always located in the belts and tend to merge when they encounter each other , much like anticyclones . 
 The deep structure of vortices is not completely clear . They are thought to be relatively thin , as any thickness greater than about 500 km will lead to instability . The large anticyclones are known to extend only a few tens of kilometers above the visible clouds . The early hypothesis that the vortices are deep convective plumes ( or convective columns ) as of 2008 is not shared by the majority of planetary scientists . 
 = = = = Great Red Spot = = = = 
 The Great Red Spot ( GRS ) is a persistent anticyclonic storm , 22 ° south of Jupiter 's equator ; observations from Earth establish a minimum storm lifetime of 350 years . A storm was described as a " permanent spot " by Gian Domenico Cassini after observing the feature in July 1665 with his instrument @-@ maker Eustachio Divini . According to a report by Giovanni Battista Riccioli in 1635 , Leander <unk> , whom Riccioli identified as the Abbot of <unk> who possessed an " extraordinary telescope " , observed a large spot that he described as " oval , equaling one seventh of Jupiter 's diameter at its longest . " According to Riccioli , " these features are seldom able to be seen , and then only by a telescope of exceptional quality and magnification . " The Great Spot has been nearly continually observed since the 1870s , however . 
 The GRS rotates counter @-@ clockwise , with a period of about six Earth days or 14 Jovian days . Its dimensions are 24 @,@ 000 – 40 @,@ 000 km east @-@ to @-@ west and 12 @,@ 000 – 14 @,@ 000 km north @-@ to @-@ south . The spot is large enough to contain two or three planets the size of Earth . At the start of 2004 , the Great Red Spot had approximately half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago , when it was 40 @,@ 000 km in diameter . At the present rate of reduction , it could potentially become circular by 2040 , although this is unlikely because of the distortion effect of the neighboring jet streams . It is not known how long the spot will last , or whether the change is a result of normal fluctuations . 
 According to a study by scientists at the University of California , Berkeley , between 1996 and 2006 the spot lost 15 percent of its diameter along its major axis . <unk> Asay @-@ Davis , who was on the team that conducted the study , noted that the spot is not disappearing because " velocity is a more robust measurement because the clouds associated with the Red Spot are also strongly influenced by numerous other phenomena in the surrounding atmosphere . " 
 Infrared data have long indicated that the Great Red Spot is colder ( and thus , higher in altitude ) than most of the other clouds on the planet ; the cloudtops of the GRS are about 8 km above the surrounding clouds . Furthermore , careful tracking of atmospheric features revealed the spot 's counterclockwise circulation as far back as 1966 – observations dramatically confirmed by the first time @-@ lapse movies from the Voyager flybys . The spot is spatially confined by a modest eastward jet stream ( prograde ) to its south and a very strong westward ( retrograde ) one to its north . Though winds around the edge of the spot peak at about 120 m / s ( 432 km / h ) , currents inside it seem stagnant , with little inflow or outflow . The rotation period of the spot has decreased with time , perhaps as a direct result of its steady reduction in size . In 2010 , astronomers imaged the GRS in the far infrared ( from 8 @.@ 5 to 24 μm ) with a spatial resolution higher than ever before and found that its central , reddest region is warmer than its surroundings by between 3 – 4 K. The warm airmass is located in the upper troposphere in the pressure range of 200 – 500 mbar . This warm central spot slowly counter @-@ rotates and may be caused by a weak subsidence of air in the center of GRS . 
 The Great Red Spot 's latitude has been stable for the duration of good observational records , typically varying by about a degree . Its longitude , however , is subject to constant variation . Because Jupiter 's visible features do not rotate uniformly at all latitudes , astronomers have defined three different systems for defining the longitude . System II is used for latitudes of more than 10 ° , and was originally based on the average rotation rate of the Great Red Spot of 9h 55m 42s . Despite this , the spot has ' lapped ' the planet in System II at least 10 times since the early 19th century . Its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the South Equatorial Belt , and the presence or absence of a South Tropical Disturbance . 
 It is not known exactly what causes the Great Red Spot 's reddish color . Theories supported by laboratory experiments suppose that the color may be caused by complex organic molecules , red phosphorus , or yet another sulfur compound . The GRS varies greatly in hue , from almost brick @-@ red to pale salmon , or even white . The higher temperature of the reddest central region is the first evidence that the Spot 's color is affected by environmental factors . The spot occasionally disappears from the visible spectrum , becoming evident only through the Red Spot Hollow , which is its niche in the South Equatorial Belt ( SEB ) . The visibility of GRS is apparently coupled to the appearance of the SEB ; when the belt is bright white , the spot tends to be dark , and when it is dark , the spot is usually light . The periods when the spot is dark or light occur at irregular intervals ; in the 50 years from 1947 to 1997 , the spot was darkest in the periods 1961 – 1966 , 1968 – 1975 , 1989 – 1990 , and 1992 – 1993 . In November 2014 , an analysis of data from NASA 's Cassini mission revealed that the red color is likely a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet 's upper atmosphere 
 The Great Red Spot should not be confused with the Great Dark Spot , a feature observed near Jupiter 's north pole in 2000 by the Cassini – Huygens spacecraft . A feature in the atmosphere of Neptune was also called the Great Dark Spot . The latter feature , imaged by Voyager 2 in 1989 , may have been an atmospheric hole rather than a storm . It was no longer present in 1994 , although a similar spot had appeared farther to the north . 
 = = = = Oval BA = = = = 
 Oval BA is a red storm in Jupiter 's southern hemisphere similar in form to , though smaller than , the Great Red Spot ( it is often affectionately referred to as " Red Spot Jr . " , " Red Jr . " or " The Little Red Spot " ) . A feature in the South Temperate Belt , Oval BA was first seen in 2000 after the collision of three small white storms , and has intensified since then . 
 The formation of the three white oval storms that later merged into Oval BA can be traced to 1939 , when the South Temperate Zone was torn by dark features that effectively split the zone into three long sections . Jovian observer Elmer J. Reese labeled the dark sections AB , CD , and EF . The rifts expanded , shrinking the remaining segments of the STZ into the white ovals FA , BC , and DE . <unk> BC and DE merged in 1998 , forming Oval BE . Then , in March 2000 , BE and FA joined together , forming Oval BA . ( see White ovals , below ) 
 Oval BA slowly began to turn red in August 2005 . On February 24 , 2006 , Filipino amateur astronomer Christopher Go discovered the color change , noting that it had reached the same shade as the GRS . As a result , NASA writer Dr. Tony Phillips suggested it be called " Red Spot Jr . " or " Red Jr . " 
 In April 2006 , a team of astronomers , believing that Oval BA might converge with the GRS that year , observed the storms through the Hubble Space Telescope . The storms pass each other about every two years , but the passings of 2002 and 2004 did not produce anything exciting . Dr. Amy Simon @-@ Miller , of the Goddard Space Flight Center , predicted the storms would have their closest passing on July 4 , 2006 . On July 20 , the two storms were photographed passing each other by the Gemini Observatory without converging . 
 Why Oval BA turned red is not understood . According to a 2008 study by Dr. Santiago Pérez @-@ Hoyos of the University of the Basque Country , the most likely mechanism is " an upward and inward diffusion of either a colored compound or a coating vapor that may interact later with high energy solar photons at the upper levels of Oval BA . " Some believe that small storms ( and their corresponding white spots ) on Jupiter turn red when the winds become powerful enough to draw certain gases from deeper within the atmosphere which change color when those gases are exposed to sunlight . 
 Oval BA is getting stronger according to observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2007 . The wind speeds have reached 618 km / h ; about the same as in the Great Red Spot and far stronger than any of the progenitor storms . As of July 2008 , its size is about the diameter of Earth — approximately half the size of the Great Red Spot . 
 Oval BA should not be confused with another major storm on Jupiter , the South Tropical Little Red Spot ( LRS ) ( nicknamed " the Baby Red Spot " by NASA ) , which was destroyed by the GRS . The new storm , previously a white spot in Hubble images , turned red in May 2008 . The observations were led by <unk> de Pater of the University of California , at Berkeley , US . The Baby Red Spot encountered the GRS in late June to early July 2008 , and in the course of a collision , the smaller red spot was shredded into pieces . The remnants of the Baby Red Spot first orbited , then were later consumed by the GRS . The last of the remnants with a reddish color to have been identified by astronomers had disappeared by mid @-@ July , and the remaining pieces again collided with the GRS , then finally merged with the bigger storm . The remaining pieces of the Baby Red Spot had completely disappeared by August 2008 . During this encounter Oval BA was present nearby , but played no apparent role in destruction of the Baby Red Spot . 
 = = = Storms and lightning = = = 
 The storms on Jupiter are similar to thunderstorms on Earth . They reveal themselves via bright clumpy clouds about 1000 km in size , which appear from time to time in the belts ' cyclonic regions , especially within the strong westward ( retrograde ) jets . In contrast to vortices , storms are short @-@ lived phenomena ; the strongest of them may exist for several months , while the average lifetime is only 3 – 4 days . They are believed to be due mainly to moist convection within Jupiter 's troposphere . Storms are actually tall convective columns ( plumes ) , which bring the wet air from the depths to the upper part of the troposphere , where it condenses in clouds . A typical vertical extent of Jovian storms is about 100 km ; as they extend from a pressure level of about 5 – 7 bar , where the base of a hypothetical water cloud layer is located , to as high as 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 5 bar . 
 Storms on Jupiter are always associated with lightning . The imaging of the night – side hemisphere of Jupiter by Galileo and Cassini spacecraft revealed regular light flashes in Jovian belts and near the locations of the westward jets , particularly at 51 ° N , 56 ° S and 14 ° S latitudes . On Jupiter lighting strikes are on average a few times more powerful than those on Earth . However , they are less frequent ; the light power emitted from a given area is similar to that on Earth . A few flashes have been detected in polar regions , making Jupiter the second known planet after Earth to exhibit polar lightning . 
 Every 15 – 17 years Jupiter is marked by especially powerful storms . They appear at 23 ° N latitude , where the strongest eastward jet , that can reach 150 m / s , is located . The last time such an event was observed was in March – June 2007 . Two storms appeared in the northern temperate belt 55 ° apart in longitude . They significantly disturbed the belt . The dark material that was shed by the storms mixed with clouds and changed the belt 's color . The storms moved with a speed as high as 170 m / s , slightly faster than the jet itself , hinting at the existence of strong winds deep in the atmosphere . 
 = = = Disturbances = = = 
 The normal pattern of bands and zones is sometimes disrupted for periods of time . One particular class of disruption are long @-@ lived <unk> of the South Tropical Zone , normally referred to as " South Tropical Disturbances " ( STD ) . The longest lived STD in recorded history was followed from 1901 until 1939 , having been first seen by Percy B. Molesworth on February 28 , 1901 . It took the form of darkening over part of the normally bright South Tropical zone . Several similar disturbances in the South Tropical Zone have been recorded since then . 
 = = = Hot spots = = = 
 One of the most mysterious features in the atmosphere of Jupiter are hot spots . In them the air is relatively free of clouds and heat can escape from the depths without much absorption . The spots look like bright spots in the infrared images obtained at the wavelength of about 5 μm . They are preferentially located in the belts , although there is a train of prominent hot spots at the northern edge of the Equatorial Zone . The Galileo Probe descended into one of those equatorial spots . Each equatorial spot is associated with a bright cloudy plume located to the west of it and reaching up to 10 @,@ 000 km in size . Hot spots generally have round shapes , although they do not resemble vortexes . 
 The origin of hot spots is not clear . They can be either downdrafts , where the descending air is adiabatically heated and dried or , alternatively , they can be a manifestation of planetary scale waves . The latter hypotheses explains the periodical pattern of the equatorial spots . 
 = = Observational history = = 
 Early astronomers , using small telescopes , recorded the changing appearance of Jupiter 's atmosphere . Their descriptive terms — belts and zones , brown spots and red spots , plumes , barges , festoons , and streamers — are still used . Other terms such as vorticity , vertical motion , cloud heights have entered in use later , in the 20th century . 
 The first observations of the Jovian atmosphere at higher resolution than possible with Earth @-@ based telescopes were taken by the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft . The first truly detailed images of Jupiter 's atmosphere were provided by the Voyagers . The two spacecraft were able to image details at a resolution as low as 5 km in size in various spectra , and also able to create " approach movies " of the atmosphere in motion . The Galileo Probe , which suffered an antenna problem , saw less of Jupiter 's atmosphere but at a better average resolution and a wider spectral bandwidth . 
 Today , astronomers have access to a continuous record of Jupiter 's atmospheric activity thanks to telescopes such as Hubble Space Telescope . These show that the atmosphere is occasionally wracked by massive disturbances , but that , overall , it is remarkably stable . The vertical motion of Jupiter 's atmosphere was largely determined by the identification of trace gases by ground @-@ based telescopes . Spectroscopic studies after the collision of Comet Shoemaker – Levy 9 gave a glimpse of the Jupiter 's composition beneath the cloud tops . The presence of diatomic sulfur ( S2 ) and carbon disulfide ( CS2 ) was recorded — the first detection of either in Jupiter , and only the second detection of S2 in any astronomical object — together with other molecules such as ammonia ( NH3 ) and hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , while oxygen @-@ bearing molecules such as sulfur dioxide were not detected , to the surprise of astronomers . 
 The Galileo atmospheric probe , as it plunged into Jupiter , measured the wind , temperature , composition , clouds , and radiation levels down to 22 bar . However , below 1 bar elsewhere on Jupiter there is uncertainty in the quantities . 
 = = = Great Red Spot studies = = = 
 The first sighting of the GRS is often credited to Robert Hooke , who described a spot on the planet in May 1664 ; however , it is likely that Hooke 's spot was in the wrong belt altogether ( the North Equatorial Belt , versus the current location in the South Equatorial Belt ) . Much more convincing is Giovanni Cassini 's description of a " permanent spot " in the following year . With fluctuations in visibility , Cassini 's spot was observed from 1665 to 1713 . 
 A minor mystery concerns a Jovian spot depicted around 1700 on a canvas by Donato <unk> , which is exhibited in the Vatican . It is a part of a series of panels in which different ( magnified ) heavenly bodies serve as backdrops for various Italian scenes , the creation of all of them overseen by the astronomer Eustachio Manfredi for accuracy . <unk> 's painting is the first known to depict the GRS as red . No Jovian feature was officially described as red before the late 19th century . 
 The present GRS was first seen only after 1830 and well @-@ studied only after a prominent apparition in 1879 . A 118 @-@ year gap separates the observations made after 1830 from its 17th @-@ century discovery ; whether the original spot dissipated and re @-@ formed , whether it faded , or even if the observational record was simply poor are unknown . The older spots had a short observational history and slower motion than that of the modern spot , which make their identity unlikely . 
 On February 25 , 1979 , when the Voyager 1 spacecraft was 9 @.@ 2 million kilometers from Jupiter it transmitted the first detailed image of the Great Red Spot back to Earth . Cloud details as small as 160 km across were visible . The colorful , wavy cloud pattern seen to the west ( left ) of the GRS is the spot 's wake region , where extraordinarily complex and variable cloud motions are observed . 
 = = = White ovals = = = 
 The white ovals that were to become Oval BA formed in 1939 . They covered almost 90 degrees of longitude shortly after their formation , but contracted rapidly during their first decade ; their length stabilized at 10 degrees or less after 1965 . Although they originated as segments of the STZ , they evolved to become completely embedded in the South Temperate Belt , suggesting that they moved north , " digging " a niche into the STB . Indeed , much like the GRS , their circulations were confined by two opposing jet streams on their northern and southern boundaries , with an eastward jet to their north and a retrograde westward one to the south . 
 The longitudinal movement of the ovals seemed to be influenced by two factors : Jupiter 's position in its orbit ( they became faster at aphelion ) , and their proximity to the GRS ( they accelerated when within 50 degrees of the Spot ) . The overall trend of the white oval drift rate was deceleration , with a decrease by half between 1940 and 1990 . 
 During the Voyager fly @-@ bys , the ovals extended roughly 9000 km from east to west , 5000 km from north to south , and rotated every five days ( compared to six for the GRS at the time ) .

 = December 2000 nor 'easter = 
 The December 2000 nor 'easter was a significant winter storm that impacted the Mid @-@ Atlantic and New England regions of the United States around the end of the month . It began as an Alberta clipper that moved southeastward through the central United States and weakened over the Ohio Valley . However , it redeveloped off the coast of North Carolina and moved northward as it intensified . It moved into central Long Island and eventually tracked northward into New England . The storm dropped heavy precipitation throughout the Northeast , especially in northern New Jersey and eastern New York , where snowfall often exceeded 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) . Even so , as it struck on a weekend , its effects were generally minor and mostly limited to travel delays , traffic accidents , and business closures . 
 = = Synoptic history = = 
 The storm developed as an Alberta clipper @-@ type low pressure area that moved southeastward across the Great Plains and Midwest . Throughout North Dakota , Minnesota and Iowa , moderate snowfall accompanied the system . After weakening over the Ohio Valley , the storm redeveloped off the coast of North Carolina . In the days preceding the event , a cyclone over eastern Canada circulated cold air southward . Computer models indicated the potential for a major storm up to seven days in advance ; however , initially , certain forecasts suggested that a separate storm over the southern U.S. would merge with the clipper . Instead , this feature moved out to sea . 
 As the secondary storm began to intensify offshore , precipitation rapidly expanded and tracked northward towards southern Virginia , eastern Maryland and Delaware , largely in the form of freezing rain , ice , and snow . From 0200 UTC on December 30 to 1200 UTC , the cyclone intensified by 13 mbar , and continued to deepen for several more hours . Snowfall reached southern New Jersey between 0600 and 0800 UTC , and New York City at around 1000 UTC . Thundersnow developed within heavy bands in some areas . The significant snow was characterized by a sharp western cutoff ; for example , in Chester County , accumulations ranged from around 6 inches in the far eastern parts of the county to only an inch along its western border with Lancaster County . 
 While located off the New Jersey coast , the storm stopped strengthening and slowly moved northward . The center was situated near central Long Island at 2100 UTC . Across eastern Long Island and parts of eastern New England , snow mixed with and , in some cases , changed over to rain . The surface low had moved into eastern Connecticut by early on December 31 . As it continued to head northeastward , a new center of low pressure developed near Boston and moved towards coastal Maine . The storm system had abated by January 1 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The storm produced moderate to heavy snowfall from eastern Pennsylvania through New Jersey , New York , and New England , extending as far north as Maine . As much as 30 in ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) fell west of the New York City metropolitan region , which generally reported 10 to 16 in ( 0 @.@ 25 to 0 @.@ 41 m ) of snow , making it the biggest snowstorm at the time since the North American blizzard of 1996 . Washington , D.C. and Baltimore recorded little or no snowfall , while 10 in ( 25 cm ) impacted Philadelphia . Eastern New York , especially the Hudson Valley and Catskill Mountains , western Connecticut , western and central Massachusetts , Vermont , New Hampshire and Maine also picked up heavy snowfall . Eastern New England received up to 1 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) before dry air from the south reduced the duration of the snow . 
 About 30 flights were canceled at the Philadelphia International Airport , and the city declared a snow emergency . Amtrak canceled Metroliner service along the northeast corridor from Washington , D.C. to New York City . Numerous businesses throughout eastern Pennsylvania closed on December 30 , although because the storm struck on a weekend , the number of traffic accidents was fairly low . 
 In New Jersey , increasing winds caused blowing and drifting of the snow and led to near @-@ blizzard conditions . Behind the storm , very cold and gusty weather lingered . New Jersey Transit shut down bus service in northern portions of the state , and rail lines had 20 @-@ minute delays . Most injuries in the state were related to physical strain while shoveling , snow blower accidents or slips and falls . As the snowfall was of a light nature , few trees limbs and electrical wires were downed by the storm . GPU Energy reported only around 5 @,@ 500 power outages . A countywide state of emergency was declared in Sussex County , as vehicles were sliding off roadways . Several other traffic accidents and delays were reported throughout the state , and in Somerset County , a few roads were closed due to the snow . A Red Cross shelter was opened for residents of a Spotswood trailer park . 
 In New York State , the heaviest snow peaked at 29 in ( 0 @.@ 74 m ) in Platte Cove , Greene County . Despite 50 flight cancellations at the Albany International Airport and several traffic accidents , no major damage or injuries were reported . Although heavy snow fell in the state , no major damage was reported in Connecticut . In Massachusetts and Rhode Island , high winds , gusting to as high as 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) buffeted the coast . 
 = Ned Flanders = 
 <unk> " Ned " Flanders , Jr. is a recurring fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons . He is voiced by Harry Shearer , and first appeared in the series premiere episode " Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire " . He is the good @-@ natured , cheery next @-@ door neighbor to the Simpson family and is generally loathed by Homer Simpson . A devout Evangelical Christian with an annoyingly perfect family , he is among the friendliest and most compassionate of Springfield 's citizens and is generally considered a pillar of the Springfield community . 
 He was one of the first characters outside of the immediate Simpson family to appear on the show , and has since been central to several episodes , the first being season two 's " Dead Putting Society " . His last name comes from Flanders St. in Portland , Oregon , the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening . When he was created , he was intended to just be a neighbor who was very nice , but whom Homer loathed . 
 In May 2015 , Harry Shearer announced that he had quit the role and that the role would be recast . However , on July 7 , it was announced Fox signed all of its main cast members , including Shearer . 
 = = Role in The Simpsons = = 
 Ned is a genuinely well @-@ meaning good @-@ natured person and is one of the few in Springfield to whom that description applies . <unk> religious , he can be timid and something of a pushover . He is a Republican and a devout Evangelical Christian who strictly follows the Bible literally and is easily shocked when challenged on any point of dogma . This has led to his frequent calls to Reverend Lovejoy , who has become increasingly frustrated with and uninterested in Flanders . 
 Ned grew up in New York and was the son of " freaky beatniks " who did not discipline Ned and let him run wild . Eventually they took him to Dr. Foster , a psychiatrist , who put the young Ned through the University of Minnesota <unk> Protocol , which involved eight months of continuous spanking . The treatment worked so well that it rendered Flanders unable to express any anger at all and resulted in his trademark nonsensical jabbering at moments when he was particularly close to losing his temper , causing Ned to unknowingly repress his anger . 
 Ned got his diploma from Oral Roberts University in an unspecified field and worked as a salesman in the pharmaceuticals industry for the bulk of his adult life . Having saved much of his earnings , Flanders decided to quit his job and invested his family 's life savings into a store in the Springfield mall called " The Leftorium " specializing in products for left @-@ handed people . Despite a meek outward appearance , Ned hides an exceptionally well @-@ toned physique . In the episode " Hurricane Neddy " a flashback to 30 years earlier shows Ned as a young child despite the fact that he is later said to be 60 years old , attributing his youthful appearance to his conformity to the " three Cs " — " clean living , chewing thoroughly , and a daily dose of vitamin church " . 
 Ned is very honest and sincere in carrying out the Christian doctrines of charity , kindness , and compassion . He is frequently shown doing volunteer work , and is rigorously honest and upright , even going so far as to spend an entire day tracking down a Leftorium customer in order to give him the extra change that he had forgotten to hand over . In " Homer 's Triple Bypass " , he donates a kidney and a lung out of the goodness of his heart to whoever needs them first . He also is a good neighbor to the Simpsons , regularly offering his assistance . Ned ’ s dogged friendship inspires the loyalty of others ; when his Leftorium appeared on the verge of bankruptcy shortly after it opened , Homer arranged a George Bailey @-@ esque bailout with the help of many people in Springfield . 
 Ned is a widower , having been married to the equally religious Maude . They had two children together ; the sheltered and naive Rod and Todd Flanders . In the eleventh season , Maude dies an untimely death in a freak accident involving a T @-@ shirt cannon ( caused and aggravated by Homer ) , leaving Flanders alone and grieving . While still married to Maude , Ned married Ginger , while on a drunken bender in Las Vegas . Ginger came to live with Ned and his sons for a brief period following Maude 's death in a later episode , but she quickly grew tired of the Flanders ' sickly @-@ sweet personalities and fled . Despite his outward <unk> , Flanders has also been connected romantically with a beautiful Christian @-@ rock singer , Rachel Jordan , movie star Sara Sloane and eventually marrying local teacher Edna Krabappel . 
 In the early years of The Simpsons , Homer Simpson generally loathed Ned , because Ned 's family , job , health and self @-@ discipline are of higher quality than he could ever hope to attain himself . Homer is often shown borrowing ( or stealing ) items from Flanders , such as a weather vane , a camcorder , a diploma , a toothbrush and an air conditioning unit . Even the Simpsons ' couch came from " the curb outside Flanders ' house " . Homer has since come to have a love @-@ hate relationship with Ned , sometimes being his best friend , partly due to Ned 's selfless tolerance of him , and other times treating Ned with complete disregard . Homer seems to genuinely care for Ned , despite still expressing and often acting on feelings of loathing . Nowadays Homer seems to regard Ned as more of a nuisance . An early running joke was that Marge considers Flanders to be a perfect neighbor and usually sides with him instead of her husband , which always enrages Homer . Flanders is normally oblivious to Homer 's disdain for him , although on occasions he has snapped at Homer after being pushed too far . 
 Flanders has been shown to call Reverend Lovejoy for advice often , even over minuscule things , to the point that Lovejoy has stopped caring and has even suggested that Flanders try a different religion . This was a running joke in the early seasons , but has been used less in the later episodes . In the eighth season , the episode " In Marge We Trust " would examine the relationship between Lovejoy and Flanders , and shows the history of their relationship and how Lovejoy became increasingly uninterested in Flanders ' problems . Flanders is shown to have a room in his house filled with memorabilia of The Beatles . He claims that this is because they were " bigger than Jesus " .

 Ned Flanders , who was designed by Rich Moore , first appeared in the season one episode " Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire " . The episode was the series premiere , but not the first episode produced . The first episode in which Flanders and his family were prominent is season two 's " Dead Putting Society " , which also contained the first appearance of Maude and Rod Flanders . Flanders was named after Flanders St. in Portland , Oregon , the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening . Groening described the inspiration for Flanders as " just a guy who was truly nice , that Homer had no justifiable reason to loathe , but then did " . It was not until after the first few episodes that it was decided Flanders would be a faithful Christian . Mike Scully noted that Flanders is " everything Homer would love to be , although he 'll never admit it " . Flanders had been meant to be just a neighbor that Homer was jealous of , but Harry Shearer used " such a sweet voice " and Flanders was broadened to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would prefer to live next to over Homer . Flanders is known for his nonsensical jabbering . His first use of the word " <unk> " was in " The Call of the Simpsons " . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Ned Flanders was not religious in his first few appearances and in the first few seasons he was only mildly religious and his primary role was to be so " cloyingly perfect as to annoy and shame the Simpsons " , whereas Homer Simpson has always hated Ned Flanders and always tries to undermine him . There has been a consistent effort among the show 's writers to make him not just " goody good and an unsympathetic person " . In the later seasons , Flanders has become more of a caricature of the Christian right , and his role as an irritating " perfect neighbor " has been lessened . For example , some recent episodes Flanders has appeared to show rather prejudice attitudes against gays and people of religions other than Christianity . 
 Ned 's store " The Leftorium " first appeared in " When Flanders Failed " . It was suggested by George Meyer , who had had a friend who had owned a left @-@ handed specialty store which failed . The episode " Hurricane Neddy " shows Ned 's faith being tested and the writers also used the episode as a chance to examine what makes him tick . 
 There have been two occasions where Flanders was not voiced by Harry Shearer . In " Bart of Darkness " , Flanders 's high pitched scream was performed by Tress MacNeille and in " Homer to the Max " , Flanders comments about cartoons being easily able to change voice actors and on that occasion he was voiced by Karl Wiedergott . 
 = = = " The Adventures of Ned Flanders " = = = 
 The Adventures of Ned Flanders is a short film that appears at the end of the fourth season Simpsons episode " The Front " . The only one to ever exist and titled Love that God , it highlights Flanders ' dedication to religion and perfect family niceness by showing Ned nearly scolding Rod and Todd after they refuse to get ready for church – only to have them inform him that it is , in fact , Saturday . Ned laughs at his mistake with a trademark " <unk> <unk> do ! " The segment was added when " The Front " was too short and the producers had already tried " every trick in the book " to lengthen it . Although the episode was scripted by Adam I. Lapidus , " Love That God " was written by Mike Reiss , Al Jean and Sam Simon . 
 Generally , fans reacted with confusion as to why the short existed . Bill Oakley and several other writers loved the short so much that they wanted to do more , but time limitations prevented them . As a result , Oakley and Josh Weinstein decided to produce an entire episode that was nothing but loosely associated shorts , which became the season seven episode " 22 Short Films about Springfield " . The Flanders / Lovejoy segment of that episode was written by David X. Cohen . " 22 Short Films about Springfield " in turn inspired the Futurama episode " Three Hundred Big Boys " .

 Although in more recent seasons Flanders has become a caricature of the Christian right , he is still a favorite of many Christian viewers . Dr. Rowan Williams , a former Archbishop of Canterbury , is a confessed Simpsons fan , and likes Flanders . Ned 's " unbearable piousness " has been described as " The Simpsons ' sharpest critique of organized religion . The show 's implicit argument seems to be that humorless obsessives like Ned have hijacked religious institutions , removing them from the center of society to a place where only those who know their brides of Beth <unk> from their wells of <unk> can seek solace . " Steve Goddard of the website Ship of Fools said , " Ned is an innocent abroad in a world of cynicism and compromise . We love him because we know what it 's like to be classed as a nerd — and to come out smiling at the end of it . "

 Ned Flanders has been described as " The United States ' most well @-@ known evangelical " .

 In 2001 and 2002 , the Greenbelt festival , a British Christian music and arts fest , held a special " Ned Flanders Night " .

 = Gene Wilder = 
 Jerome Silberman ( born June 11 , 1933 ) , known professionally as Gene Wilder , is an American stage and screen comic actor , screenwriter , and author . 
 Wilder began his career on stage , and made his screen debut in the TV @-@ series Armstrong Circle Theatre in 1962 . Although his first film role was portraying a hostage in the 1967 motion picture Bonnie and Clyde , Wilder 's first major role was as Leopold Bloom in the 1968 film The Producers for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor . This was the first in a series of collaborations with writer / director Mel Brooks , including 1974 's Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein , which Wilder co @-@ wrote , garnering the pair an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay . Wilder is known for his portrayal of Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory ( 1971 ) and for his four films with Richard Pryor : Silver Streak ( 1976 ) , Stir Crazy ( 1980 ) , See No Evil , Hear No Evil ( 1989 ) , and Another You ( 1991 ) . Wilder has directed and written several of his films , including The Woman in Red ( 1984 ) . 
 His third wife was actress Gilda Radner , with whom he starred in three films . Her death from ovarian cancer led to his active involvement in promoting cancer awareness and treatment , helping found the Gilda Radner Ovarian Cancer Detection Center in Los Angeles and co @-@ founding Gilda 's Club . 
 Since his most recent contribution to acting in 2003 , Wilder has turned his attention to writing . He has produced a memoir in 2005 , Kiss Me Like a Stranger : My Search for Love and Art ; a collection of stories , What Is This Thing Called Love ? ( 2010 ) ; and the novels My French Whore ( 2007 ) , The Woman Who Wouldn 't ( 2008 ) and Something to Remember You By ( 2013 ) . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Born Jerome Silberman in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , on June 11 , 1933 , Wilder is the son of William J. and Jeanne ( Baer ) Silberman . He adopted " Gene Wilder " for his professional name at the age of 26 , later explaining , " I had always liked Gene because of Thomas Wolfe 's character Eugene Gant in Look Homeward , Angel and Of Time and the River . And I was always a great admirer of Thornton Wilder . " Wilder first became interested in acting at age 8 , when his mother was diagnosed with rheumatic fever and the doctor told him to " try and make her laugh . " 
 At the age of 11 , he saw his sister , who was studying acting , performing onstage , and was enthralled by the experience . He asked her teacher if he could become his student , and the teacher said that if he were still interested at age 13 , he would take Wilder on as a student . The day after Wilder turned 13 , he called the teacher , who accepted him ; Wilder studied with him for two years . 
 When Jeanne Silberman felt that her son 's potential was not being fully realized in Wisconsin , she sent him to Black @-@ Foxe , a military institute in Hollywood , where he wrote that he was bullied and sexually assaulted , primarily because he was the only Jewish boy in the school . After an unsuccessful short stay at Black @-@ Foxe , Wilder returned home and became increasingly involved with the local theatre community . At age 15 , he performed for the first time in front of a paying audience , as Balthasar ( Romeo 's manservant ) in a production of Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet . Gene Wilder graduated from Washington High School in Milwaukee in 1951 . 
 Wilder was raised Jewish , but holds only the Golden Rule as his philosophy . He described himself as a " Jewish @-@ Buddhist @-@ Atheist " in an interview published in 2005 .

 = = = Early starts : Old Vic and Army = = = 
 Wilder studied Communication and Theatre Arts at the University of Iowa , where he was a member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity . Following his 1955 graduation from Iowa , he was accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in Bristol , England . After six months of studying fencing , Wilder became the first freshman to win the All @-@ School Fencing Championship . Desiring to study Stanislavski 's system , he returned to the U.S. , living with his sister and her family in Queens . Wilder enrolled at the HB Studio . 
 Wilder was drafted into the Army on September 10 , 1956 . At the end of recruit training , he was assigned to the medical corps and sent to Fort Sam Houston for training . He was then given the opportunity to choose any post that was open , and wanting to stay near New York City to attend acting classes at the HB Studio , he chose to serve as paramedic in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Valley Forge Army Hospital , in Phoenixville , Pennsylvania . In November 1957 , his mother died from ovarian cancer . He was discharged from the army a year later and returned to New York . A scholarship to the HB Studio allowed him to become a full @-@ time student . At first living on unemployment insurance and some savings , he later supported himself with odd jobs such as a limousine driver and fencing instructor . Wilder 's first professional acting job was in Cambridge , Massachusetts , where he played the Second Officer in Herbert Berghof 's production of Twelfth Night . He also served as a fencing choreographer . 
 After three years of study with Berghof and Uta Hagen at the HB Studio , Charles Grodin told Wilder about Lee Strasberg 's method acting . Grodin persuaded him to leave the studio and begin studying with Strasberg in his private class . Several months later , Wilder was accepted into the Actors Studio . Feeling that " Jerry Silberman in Macbeth " did not have the right ring to it , he adopted a stage name . He chose " Wilder " because it reminded him of Our Town author Thornton Wilder , while " Gene " came from Thomas Wolfe 's first novel , Look Homeward , Angel . He also liked " Gene " because as a boy , he was impressed by a distant relative , a World War II bomber navigator who was " handsome and looked great in his leather flight jacket . " He later said that he could not see Gene Wilder playing Macbeth , either . After joining the Actors Studio , he slowly began to be noticed in the off @-@ Broadway scene , thanks to performances in Sir Arnold Wesker 's Roots and in Graham Greene 's The Complaisant Lover , for which Wilder received the Clarence Derwent Award for " Best Performance by an Actor in a <unk> Role . " 
 = = = Mel Brooks = = = 
 In 1963 , Wilder was cast in a leading role in Mother Courage and Her Children , a production starring Anne Bancroft , who introduced Wilder to her boyfriend Mel Brooks . A few months later , Brooks mentioned that he was working on a screenplay called Springtime for Hitler , for which he thought Wilder would be perfect in the role of Leo Bloom . Brooks elicited a promise from Wilder that he would check with him before making any long @-@ term commitments . Months went by , and Wilder toured the country with different theatre productions , participated in a televised CBS presentation of Death of a Salesman , and was cast for his first role in a film — a minor role in Arthur Penn 's 1967 Bonnie and Clyde . After three years of not hearing from Brooks , Wilder was called for a reading with Zero Mostel , who was to be the star of Springtime for Hitler and had approval of his co @-@ star . Mostel approved , and Wilder was cast for his first leading role in a feature film , 1968 's The Producers . 
 The Producers eventually became a cult comedy classic , with Mel Brooks winning an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Wilder being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor . Nevertheless , Brooks ' first directorial effort did not do well at the box office and was not well received by all critics ; New York Times critic Renata Adler reviewed the film and described it as " black college humor " . 
 In 1969 , Wilder relocated to Paris , accepting a leading role in Bud Yorkin 's Start the Revolution Without Me , a comedy that took place during the French Revolution . After shooting ended , Wilder returned to New York , where he read the script for <unk> Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx and immediately called Sidney Glazier , who produced The Producers . Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film . Jean Renoir was the first candidate , but he would not be able to do the film for at least a year , so British @-@ Indian director Waris Hussein was hired . 
 = = = Willy Wonka , Young Frankenstein , and Richard Pryor = = = 
 In 1971 , Wilder auditioned to play Willy Wonka in Mel Stuart 's film adaptation of Roald Dahl 's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . After reciting some lines , Wilder prepared to leave the auditioning station , but Mel Stuart ( who was a Gene Wilder fan ) ran after him , offering the role to Wilder immediately . Wilder was initially hesitant when he learned more on the role , but finally accepted the role under one condition : 
 When I make my first entrance , I 'd like to come out of the door carrying a cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp . After the crowd sees Willy Wonka is a cripple , they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet . As I walk toward them , my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I 'm walking on and stands straight up , by itself ... but I keep on walking , until I realize that I no longer have my cane . I start to fall forward , and just before I hit the ground , I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up , to great applause . 
 When Stuart asked why , Wilder replied , " Because from that time on , no one will know if I 'm lying or telling the truth . " 
 All three films Wilder did after The Producers were box office failures : Start the Revolution and <unk> seemed to audiences poor copies of Mel Brooks films , while Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was not a commercial success , seeming , to some parents , a moral story " too cruel " for children to understand , thus failing to attract family audiences . Willy Wonka did gain a cult following and an Oscar nomination for Best Score , as well as a Golden Globe award nomination for Wilder . When Woody Allen offered him a role in one segment of Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * ( * But Were Afraid to Ask ) , Wilder accepted , hoping this would be the hit to put an end to his series of flops . Everything ... was a hit , grossing over $ 18 million in the United States alone against a $ 2 @-@ million budget . 
 After Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * ( * But Were Afraid to Ask ) , Wilder began working on a script he called Young Frankenstein . After he wrote a two @-@ page scenario , and called Mel Brooks , who told him that it seemed like a " cute " idea , but showed little interest . A few months later , Wilder received a call from his agent , Mike Medavoy , who asked if he had anything where he could include Peter Boyle and Marty Feldman , his two new clients . Having just seen Feldman on television , Wilder was inspired to write a scene that takes place at Transylvania Station , where Igor and Frederick meet for the first time . The scene was later included in the film almost verbatim . Medavoy liked the idea and called Brooks , asking him to direct . Brooks was not convinced , but having spent four years working on two box @-@ office failures , he decided to accept . While working on the Young Frankenstein script , Wilder was offered the part of the Fox in the musical film adaptation of Saint Exupéry 's classic book , The Little Prince . When filming was about to begin in London , Wilder received an urgent call from Brooks , who was filming Blazing Saddles , offering Wilder the role of the " Waco Kid " after Dan Dailey dropped out at the last minute , while Gig Young became too ill to continue . Wilder shot his scenes for Blazing Saddles and immediately afterwards filmed The Little Prince . 
 After Young Frankenstein was written , the rights were to be sold to Columbia Pictures , but after having trouble agreeing on the budget , Wilder , Brooks , and producer Michael <unk> went with 20th Century Fox , where both Brooks and Wilder had to sign five @-@ year contracts . Young Frankenstein was a commercial success , with Wilder and Brooks receiving Best Adapted Screenplay nominations at the 1975 Oscars , losing to Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adaptation of The Godfather Part II . While filming Young Frankenstein , Wilder had an idea for a romantic musical comedy about a brother of Sherlock Holmes . Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn agreed to participate in the project , and Wilder began writing what became his directorial début , 1975 's The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes ' Smarter Brother . 
 In 1975 , Wilder 's agent sent him a script for a film called Super Chief . Wilder accepted , but told the film 's producers that he thought the only person who could keep the film from being offensive was Richard Pryor . Pryor accepted the role in the film , which had been renamed Silver Streak , the first film to team Wilder and Pryor . While filming Silver Streak , Wilder began working on a script for The World 's Greatest Lover , inspired by Fellini 's The White Sheik . Wilder wrote , produced , and directed The World 's Greatest Lover , which premièred in 1977 , but was a critical failure . The Frisco Kid ( 1979 ) was Wilder 's next project . The film was to star John Wayne , but he dropped out when the Warner Brothers executives tried to dissuade him from charging the studio his usual $ 1 @-@ million fee . Wayne also was ill for many years and died in June 1979 . Harrison Ford , then an up @-@ and @-@ coming actor , was hired for the role . 
 = = = Sidney Poitier and Gilda Radner = = = 
 In 1980 , Sidney Poitier and producer Hannah Weinstein persuaded Wilder and Richard Pryor to do another film together . Bruce Jay Friedman wrote the script for Stir Crazy , with Poitier directing , for Columbia Pictures . Pryor was struggling with a severe cocaine addiction , and filming became difficult , but once the film premiered , it became an international success . New York magazine listed " Skip Donahue " ( Wilder ) and " Harry Monroe " ( Pryor ) as number nine on their 2007 list of " The Fifteen Most Dynamic <unk> in Pop Culture History " , and the film has often appeared in " best comedy " lists and rankings . 
 Poitier and Wilder became friends , with the pair working together on a script called Traces — which became 1982 's Hanky Panky , the film where Wilder met comedian Gilda Radner . Through the remainder of the decade , Wilder and Radner worked in several projects together . After Hanky Panky , Wilder directed his third film , 1984 's The Woman in Red , which starred Wilder , Radner , and Kelly Le Brock . The Woman in Red was not well received by the critics , nor was their next project , 1986 's Haunted Honeymoon , which failed to attract audiences . The Woman in Red did win an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Stevie Wonder 's song " I Just Called to Say I Love You " . 
 TriStar Pictures wanted to produce another film starring Wilder and Pryor , and Wilder agreed to do See No Evil , Hear No Evil only if he were allowed to rewrite the script . The studio agreed , and See No Evil , Hear No Evil premiered on May 1989 to mostly negative reviews . Many critics praised Wilder and Pryor , as well as Kevin Spacey 's performance , but they mostly agreed that the script was terrible . Roger Ebert called it " a real dud " ; the Deseret Morning News described the film as " stupid " , with an " idiotic script " that had a " contrived story " and too many " juvenile gags " , while Vincent Canby called it " by far the most successful co @-@ starring vehicle for Mr. Pryor and Mr. Wilder " , also acknowledging that " this is not elegant movie making , and not all of the gags are equally clever " . 
 = = = 1990s – 2000s = = = 
 After starring as a political cartoonist who falls in love in the 1990 film Funny About Love , Wilder did one final movie with Pryor , the 1991 feature Another You , in which Pryor 's physical deterioration from multiple sclerosis was clearly noticeable . It was Pryor 's last starring role in a film ( he appeared in a few cameos before his death in 2005 ) and also marked Wilder 's last appearance to date in a feature film . Neither of his last two movies was financially successful . His remaining work has consisted of television movies and guest appearances in TV shows . 
 In 1994 , Wilder starred in the NBC sitcom Something Wilder . The show received poor reviews and lasted only one season . He went back to the small screen in 1999 , appearing in three television movies , one of which was the NBC adaptation of Alice in Wonderland . The other two , Murder in a Small Town and The Lady in Question , were mystery movies for A & E TV that were cowritten by Wilder , in which he played a theatre director turned amateur detective . Three years later , Wilder guest @-@ starred on two episodes of NBC 's Will & Grace , winning a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor on a Comedy Series for his role as Mr. Stein , Will Truman 's boss .

 Wilder met his first wife , Mary Mercier , while studying at the HB Studio in New York . Although the couple had not been together long , they married on July 22 , 1960 . They spent long periods of time apart , eventually divorcing in 1965 . A few months later , Wilder began dating Mary Joan Schutz , a friend of his sister . Schutz had a daughter , Katharine , from a previous marriage . When Katharine started calling Wilder " Dad , " he decided to do what he felt was " the right thing to do , " marrying Schutz on October 27 , 1967 , and adopting Katharine that same year . Schutz and Wilder separated after seven years of marriage , with Katharine thinking that Wilder was having an affair with his Young Frankenstein co @-@ star , Madeline Kahn . After the divorce , he briefly dated his other Frankenstein co @-@ star , Teri Garr . Wilder eventually became estranged from Katharine . 
 Wilder met Saturday Night Live actress Gilda Radner on August 13 , 1981 , while filming Sidney Poitier 's Hanky Panky . Radner was married to guitarist G. E. Smith at the time , but Wilder and she became inseparable friends . When the filming of Hanky Panky ended , Wilder found himself missing Radner , so he called her . The relationship grew , and Radner eventually divorced Smith in 1982 . She moved in with Wilder , and the couple married on September 14 , 1984 , in the south of France . The couple wanted to have children , but Radner suffered miscarriages , and doctors could not determine the problem . After experiencing severe fatigue and suffering from pain in her upper legs on the set of Haunted Honeymoon , Radner sought medical treatment . Following a number of false diagnoses , she was found to have ovarian cancer in October 1986 . Over the next year and a half , Radner battled the disease , receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments . The disease finally went into remission , giving the pair a respite , during which time Wilder filmed See No Evil , Hear No Evil . By May 1989 , the cancer returned and had metastasized . Radner died on May 20 , 1989 . Wilder later stated , " I always thought she 'd pull through . " 
 Following Radner 's death , Wilder became active in promoting cancer awareness and treatment , helping found the Gilda Radner Ovarian Cancer Detection Center in Los Angeles and co @-@ founding Gilda 's Club , a support group to raise awareness of cancer that began in New York City and now has branches throughout the country . 
 While preparing for his role as a deaf man in See No Evil , Hear No Evil , Wilder met Karen Webb ( née Boyer ) , who was a clinical supervisor for the New York League for the Hard of Hearing . Webb coached him in lip reading . Following Gilda Radner 's death , Wilder and Webb reconnected , and on September 8 , 1991 , they married . The two live in Stamford , Connecticut , in the 1734 Colonial home that he shared with Radner .

 = White Dog = 
 White Dog is a 1982 American drama film directed by Samuel Fuller using a screenplay written by Fuller and Curtis Hanson loosely based on Romain Gary 's 1970 novel of the same title . The film depicts the struggle of a dog trainer named Keys ( Paul Winfield ) , who is black , trying to retrain a stray dog found by a young actress ( Kristy McNichol ) , that is a " white dog " — a dog trained to viciously attack any black person . Fuller uses the film as a platform to deliver an anti @-@ racist message as it examines the question of whether racism is a treatable problem or an incurable condition . 
 The film 's theatrical release was suppressed in the United States by Paramount Pictures out of concern of negative press after rumors began circulating that the film was racist . It was released internationally in France and the United Kingdom in 1982 , and broadcast on various American cable television channels . Its first official American release came in December 2008 when The Criterion Collection released the original uncut film to DVD . 
 Critics praised the film 's hard line look at racism and Fuller 's use of melodrama and metaphors to present his argument , and its somewhat disheartening ending that leaves the impression that while racism is learned , it cannot be cured . Reviewers consistently questioned the film 's lack of wide release in the United States when it was completed and applauded its belated release by Criterion . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Young actress Julie Sawyer ( Kristy McNichol ) accidentally runs over a stray White German Shepherd Dog one night . After the dog is treated by a vet , Julie takes him home while trying to find his owners . A rapist breaks into her house and tries to attack her , but the dog protects her so she decides to adopt him , against the wishes of her boyfriend ( Jameson Parker ) . Unbeknown to her , the dog was trained by a white racist to attack any and all black people on sight . It sneaks out of the house one night and kills a black truck driver in an attack . Later , when Julie takes the dog to work with her , it attacks a black actress on the set . 
 Realizing something is not right with the dog , Julie takes him to a dog trainer , Carruthers ( Burl Ives ) , who tells her to kill the dog . Another dog trainer named Keys ( Paul Winfield ) , who is black himself , undertakes re @-@ educating the dog as a personal challenge . He dons protective gear and keeps the dog in a large enclosure , taking him out on a chain and exposing himself to the dog each day and making sure he is the only one to feed or care for the dog . 
 The dog manages to escape , and kills an elderly black man in a church , after which Keys manages to recover him , and opts not to turn the dog in to the authorities , but to continue the training , over Julie 's protests . He warns her that the training has reached a critical point , where the dog might be cured or go insane . He believes that curing the dog will discourage white racists from training dogs like this , though there is no indication in the story that this is any kind of national problem ( the film is set well after the civil rights era , the setting of the original novel ) . 
 After a lengthy time , it seems as if the dog is cured , in that he is now friendly towards Keys . Julie confronts the dog 's original owner , who has come to claim him , and who presumably trained him to attack black people . She angrily tells him in front of his grandchildren , who only know the dog as a loving family pet , that the dog has been cured by a black man . 
 Just as Julie and Keys celebrate their victory , the dog , without warning , turns its attention to Carruthers and brutally attacks him . The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him — no explanation for this is given , but the implication is that the dog 's programming has somehow been reversed , though that was never Keys ' intention . To save his employer 's life , Keys is forced to shoot the dog , and the film ends with the image of the dog 's body lying in the center of the training enclosure . 
 = = Themes = = 
 White Dog is a " blunt , highly cinematic parable about race relations " that questions whether racism is a curable mental illness or learned behavior , or if it is an untreatable disease . The unnamed white German Shepherd is the metaphor of racism , with his radically contrasting moments of innocent , typical dog behavior when not around black persons , and his snarling viciousness when he sees a target . Paul Winfield 's character Keys , who believes he can help the dog unlearn this behavior , represents the view that racism can be unlearned . Keys ' attempts to reprogram the dog become a " bold <unk> of the race war " , and as the film progresses Keys becomes obsessed with the idea that he can cure the dog . Much like Captain Ahab , he declares that if he fails with this dog , he will find another and another until he succeeds . Keys ' counterpart , Carruthers , a white trainer , believes the dog is irredeemable and should be killed , representing the view that racism cannot be cured . 
 The snarling dog , its white fur stained with bright red stage blood , becomes a typically imposing , <unk> Fuller image - the embodiment of snarling , irrational and implacable hatred . Typical , too , is the way Fuller emphasizes the radical contrast between the dog in its innocent , <unk> state – big brown eyes staring up at McNichol – and its plunging , salivating attack mode . 
 Scenes showing Kristy McNichol innocently burying her hands in the dog 's fur and his normal loving behavior when alone with her provides a stark image of " how hatred can be familiar , reassuringly close " . J. Hoberman argues that the film " <unk> racism in an unnatural way " in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog 's behavior , and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life . The film 's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller 's own view that racism is something that is learned , but that once learned is a " poison " that can never truly " be banished from those it infects " . But on the other hand , the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks , but not cured of his own hatred since the last thing he does is to , unprovoked , attack a white man . The ending implies therefore that it is hatred ( and not racism ) that cannot be banished from those it infects . 
 In the original Romain Gary novel , this was not the story that was told — the dog started to attack white people because a black man embittered by white racism deliberately retrained him to do so . 
 = = Production = = 
 White Dog 's roots lie with a 1970 autobiographical novel written by Romain Gary of the same name . The story was purchased for use by Paramount in 1975 , with Curtis Hanson selected to write the screenplay and Roman Polanski hired to direct . Before shooting commenced , Polanski was charged with statutory rape and fled the country , leaving the production in limbo . Over a span of six years , the project was given to various writers and producers , who all focused on the stray dog story from Gary 's original work . Gary 's activist wife was replaced in the script with a young , unmarried actress because Paramount wanted to contrast the dog 's random attacks with a loving relationship between the protagonist and the dog . Paramount executives noted that they wanted a " Jaws with paws " and indicated that they wanted any racial elements to be downplayed . In one memo , the company noted : " Given the organic elements of this story , it is imperative that we never overtly address through attitude or statement the issue of racism per se " . 
 By 1981 , Gary 's wife and then Gary himself had committed suicide . At the same time , Hollywood was under threat of strikes by both the writer and director guilds . Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened , White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be <unk> in a short time frame . With a push from Michael Eisner , White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production . Eisner pushed for the film to be one of the selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned . Producer Jon Davison was less certain and questioned the film 's marketing early on . Hanson , back on board as the film 's screenwriter , suggested Samuel Fuller be named the film 's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget , while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material . Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film . 
 Fuller readily agreed , having focused much of his career on racial issues . Already familiar with the novel and with the concept of " white dogs " , he was tasked with " <unk> " the film to have the conflict depicted in the book occur within the dog rather than the people . In an earlier Variety magazine interview , Fuller stated that viewers would " see a dog slowly go insane and then come back to sanity " . Before filming began , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , the Black Anti @-@ Defamation Coalition ( <unk> ) , and other civil @-@ rights leaders began voicing concerns that the film would spur racial violence . In an editorial in the Los Angeles Times , Robert Price , executive director of the <unk> , criticized the studio for producing the film based on a book by a white man and using a primarily white cast and crew , rather than producing the film with African Americans in key positions . He also considered Gary 's work to be a " second @-@ rate novel " and questioned its use when " book shelves are laden with quality novels by black writers who explore the same social and psychological areas with far more subtlety ? " 
 Fuller was confident in his work and the idea that the film would be strongly antiracist , particularly with the changes he had made to the original work . The novel 's hate @-@ filled Muslim black trainer , who deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people , was converted into the character of Keys , who genuinely wished to cure the animal . Fuller also changed the novel 's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending . The film was shot in only forty @-@ five days at a cost of $ 7 million . Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character . 
 After filming commenced Paramount Pictures brought in two African @-@ American consultants to review and approve the depiction of the black characters : Willis Edwards , vice president of the local NAACP chapter and David L. <unk> , the vice president and stage manager of the local PBS affiliate . In the end , they walked away with different views of the film . <unk> did not find the film to have any racist connotations , while Edwards found it inflammatory and felt it should not have been made , particularly during that year when a series of murders of black children was occurring in Atlanta . The two men provided a write @-@ up of their views for the studio executives , which were passed to Davison along with warnings that the studio feared a film boycott . Fuller was not told of these discussions nor given the notes until two weeks before filming was slated to conclude . Known for being a staunch integrationist and for his regularly giving black actors non @-@ stereotypical roles , Fuller was furious , finding the studio 's actions insulting . He reportedly had both representatives banned from the set afterwards , though he did integrate some of the suggested changes into the film . 
 The film was completed in 1981 , but Paramount was hesitant to release the film out of continuing concerns that the film would be misconstrued . Though no one from the organization had viewed the completed film , the NAACP threatened boycotts . In early 1982 , the studio finally held preview screenings in Seattle , Washington and Denver , Colorado , with mixed responses . That fall , another test run was held in Detroit , Michigan , which resulted in praise from critics but little public interest . The film was finally left unreleased , with Paramount feeling it did not have enough earnings potential to go against the threatened boycotts and possible bad publicity . Dumbfounded and hurt by the film 's shelving , Fuller moved to France , and never directed another American film .

 Paramount felt the film was too controversial for release , giving it only a few limited preview runs before shelving it . The film 's first theatrical release occurred in France on July 7 , 1982 . In the United Kingdom , it was part of the 37th Edinburgh International Film Festival and the 27th London Film Festival in 1983 , and was released late that year by United International Pictures . It received positive reviews in both countries . Lisa Dombrowski of Film Comment notes , " In the end , Sam Fuller 's White Dog was muzzled by a collision of historically specific economic and political interests , as support for freedom of expression took a backseat to Paramount 's bottom line and the NAACP 's ongoing battles with Hollywood over representation and employment . A Sam Fuller thriller was simply not the kind of antiracist picture that a major studio knew how to market in 1981 or that African @-@ American organizations wanted Hollywood to make at the time " . 
 In 1983 , White Dog was edited for a direct @-@ to @-@ television broadcast and made available purchase by cable channels . The following year , NBC bought broadcast rights for $ 2 @.@ 5 million and slated the film to air during the February sweeps , then canceled the broadcast two days later due to pressure from the continuing NAACP campaign and concerns of a negative reaction by both viewers and advertisers . The film was eventually aired on other cable channels sporadically and without fanfare . It was also infrequently screened at independent film houses and film festivals . 
 Its first official American release came on December 2 , 2008 , when The Criterion Collection released the film to DVD . The DVD has the uncut version of the film , video interviews from the original producer and writer , an interview with the trainer of the dog used in the film , and a booklet of critical essays . The National Society of Film Critics bestowed the distributor with a special film heritage award for releasing the film .

 Due to its limited release , it only grossed $ 46 @,@ 509 . While today the film is generally seen as a B @-@ movie , it was initially praised by critics upon its release , particularly for its treatment of racism and Fuller 's directorial talents . Dave Kehr , of the Chicago Tribune , praised Fuller for " pulling no punches " in the film and for his use of metaphors to present racism " as a mental disease , for which there may or may not be a cure " . Kehr considered the film less melodramatic or bizarre than Fuller 's earlier works , which was also positive since it left the film " clean and uncluttered with a single , concentrated line of development mounting toward a single , crushingly pessimistic moral insight " . Entertainment Weekly 's Kim Moran called it a " uncompromising , poignant examination of racism " and felt it was one of Fuller 's most inspired films and a " gripping , meditative , and ultimately beautiful achievement " . Video Business reviewer Cyril Pearl called it " bombastic , odd and quite chilling " and felt the film was an antiracist work that " deserve [ d ] an audience " . 
 Charles Taylor , writing for The New York Times , lambasted the film 's original suppression due to " the stupidity of pressure groups " that wrongly labeled the film as racist when it is , in his words , " a profoundly antiracist film , though a despairing one " . He praised Winfield 's tense performance and Fuller 's use of melodrama to create one of his " most potent " films . Lisa Dombrowski , the author The Films of Samuel Fuller : If You Die , I 'll Kill You ! and an associate professor of film studies at Wesleyan University , referred to the film as " an impassioned attack on racial hatred " . Another New York Times reviewer , Janet Maslin , praised Fuller 's " command of stark , spooky imagery " , " B @-@ style bluntness " , and the way the cinematography , scene setting , and soundtrack combine to give the film " the blunt , unnerving power of a horror story " . She also commended Paul Winfield 's performance as Keys , feeling the actor turned what might have been a boring character into one audiences would find interesting . Slant Magazine 's Fernando F. Croce felt the film was " part marauding @-@ animal horror movie , part Afterschool Special , [ and ] part tragic @-@ sardonic agitprop " B @-@ movie that is " searing confrontation of the irrationality of prejudice " . 
 In The Magic Hour : Film at Fin de Siècle , J. Hoberman referred to the film as an " unusually blunt and suggestive metaphoric account of American racism " . Though he felt the film was a " sad waste " of Fuller 's talent , he praised the director 's treatment of the work , including the changes made to the source material , noting that " filmed in headlines , framed as allegory , White Dog combines hard @-@ boiled sentimentality and hysterical violence . " He praised the musical score used in the film for lending dignity to the " iconic visuals and cartoon dialogue . " 
 = The Seven Crystal Balls = 
 The Seven Crystal Balls ( French : Les Sept Boules de Cristal ) is the thirteenth volume of The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé . The story was serialised daily in Le Soir , Belgium 's leading francophone newspaper , from December 1943 amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II . The story was cancelled abruptly following the Allied liberation in September 1944 , when Hergé was accused of collaborating with the occupying Germans and banned from working . After he was cleared two years later , the story was then serialised weekly in the new Tintin magazine from September 1946 to April 1948 . The story revolves around the investigations of a young reporter Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock into the abduction of their friend Professor Calculus and its connection to a mysterious illness which has afflicted the members of an archaeological expedition to Peru . 
 The Seven Crystal Balls was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion . Hergé concluded the arc begun in this story with Prisoners of the Sun , while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco @-@ Belgian comics tradition . Critics have ranked The Seven Crystal Balls as one of the best Adventures of Tintin , describing it as the most frightening instalment in the series . The story was adapted for the 1969 Belvision film , Tintin and the Temple of the Sun and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Young reporter Tintin , his dog Snowy , and his friend Captain Haddock spend an evening at the music hall . There , they witness the performance of a clairvoyant , Madame <unk> , who predicts the illness of one of the Sanders @-@ Hardiman expedition members , who recently returned from an archaeological expedition to the Andes mountains . They also view the act of a knife thrower whom Tintin recognises as General Alcazar , former President of San Theodoros . Meeting him backstage , Alcazar introduces them to his Indio assistant , Chiquito , and learn that he was deposed ( once again ) by his rival General Tapioca . 
 The next day , they learn that the members of the Sanders @-@ Hardiman expedition are falling into comas , with fragments of a shattered crystal ball found near each victim . Concerned , Tintin , Haddock , and their friend Professor Calculus visit Calculus 's old friend Professor Hercules Tarragon , the only expedition member yet to be affected . Professor Tarragon is under police guard , and he shows his visitors the mummified body of Inca king Rascar Capac , which the expedition brought back with them from Peru . A lightning storm strikes the house and sends ball lightning down the chimney and onto the mummy — which evaporates . Worried , Tarragon states that this reflects the culmination of Capac 's prophecy , which declares that punishment will descend upon those who desecrate his tomb . Spending the stormy night at Tarragon 's house , Tintin , Haddock , and Calculus are each awoken by a dream involving Capac 's mummy . They find Tarragon comatose in his bed , with the accompanying crystal shards nearby ; the attacker had bypassed the guards by climbing in via the chimney . The next day , Calculus is walking on the grounds of Tarragon 's house when he discovers one of the mummy 's bracelets , which he places on himself . 
 Tintin and Haddock later realise that Calculus has gone missing , and surmise that he has been kidnapped by the same individual who placed Tarragon in a coma . The police set up road blocks , but the kidnappers switch cars and are able to evade them . Tintin visits a hospital where the seven stricken members of the Sanders @-@ Hardiman expedition are housed ; he is astonished that at a precise time of day , all awaken and scream about figures attacking them before slipping back into their comas . Haddock is dejected by Calculus ' abduction , but upon learning that police have spotted the kidnapper 's car at a port , he and Tintin race there , believing that the abductors seek to board a boat with Calculus and take him abroad . At the docks , they spot Alcazar boarding a ship to South America ; he reveals that Chiquito has disappeared and that he was one of the last descendants of the Inca , with Tintin surmising that Chiquito must be one of Calculus ' captors . 
 Having lost Calculus ' trail , Tintin and Haddock decide to pay a visit to Haddock 's old friend Chester , who has docked at another nearby port . They miss Chester , but instead discover Calculus ' hat on the docks , indicating that he was taken to sea from here . Investigating , they realise that Calculus must be aboard the Pachacamac , a ship headed to Peru , and board a flight , intent on intercepting its arrival .

 Amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II , Hergé had accepted a position working for Le Soir , Belgian 's largest Francophone daily newspaper . Confiscated from its original owners , the German authorities permitted Le Soir to reopen under the directorship of Belgian editor Raymond de Becker , although it remained firmly under Nazi control , supporting the German war effort and espousing anti @-@ Semitism . Joining Le Soir on 15 October 1940 , Hergé was aided by old friend Paul Jamin and the cartoonist Jacques Van Melkebeke . Some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration , although he was heavily enticed by the size of Le Soir 's readership , which reached 600 @,@ 000 . Faced with the reality of Nazi oversight , Hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work , instead adopting a policy of neutrality . Without the need to satirise political types , entertainment producer and author Harry Thompson observed that " Hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy . The public reacted positively . " 
 Following the culmination of his previous Tintin adventure , Red Rackham 's Treasure , Hergé had agreed to a proposal that the newspaper could include a detective story revolving around his characters , Thomson and Thompson . Titled Dupont et Dupond , détectives ( " Thomson and Thompson , Detectives " ) , Hergé provided the illustrations while the story was authored by the Le Soir crime writer Paul Kinnet . While this was being serialised , Hergé began contemplating ideas for his new Tintin adventure , toying with the idea of a story surrounding a dangerous invention that Calculus had developed . The story was probably inspired by an article authored by Le Soir 's science correspondent , Bernard Heuvelmans , and while Hergé did not use it at the time , he revived it a decade later as the basis for The Calculus Affair . 
 As with Hergé 's two previous stories , The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham 's Treasure , The Seven Crystal Balls was designed as part of a twofold story arc , to be concluded with the then yet unnamed Prisoners of the Sun . Hergé planned for the former story to outline a mystery , while the latter would see his characters undertake an expedition to solve it . His use of an ancient mummy 's curse around which the narrative revolved was inspired by tales of a curse of the pharaohs which had been unearthed during the archaeologist Howard Carter 's 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun 's tomb . This was not the first time that Hergé had been inspired by this tabloid story , having previously done so when authoring Cigars of the Pharaoh . 
 In autumn 1943 , Hergé decided that he wanted Edgar P. Jacobs , a fellow cartoonist , to collaborate with him on The Adventures of Tintin . Although initially hesitant , Jacobs eventually agreed , adopting the paid position in January 1944 . The two became close friends and artistic collaborators , with Jacobs aiding him in developing various aspects of the plot , for instance developing the idea of the crystal balls and the story 's title . Although stylistically they were different both in forms of illustration and narrative , they influenced each other greatly . He used Jacobs as a life model from whom he drew various poses that characters adopt in the story . He also used Jacobs as a researcher , sending him to the Cinquantenaire Museum to study its collections of Incan material , and it was the mummified Incan corpse in their collection that was used as the basis for the mummy of Rascar Capac . 
 The museum 's director , Professor <unk> , exhibited similarities with Professor Tarragon , a new character that Hergé had developed for the story . He also included a number of characters who had previously appeared in earlier adventures , among them Professor <unk> from The Shooting Star , General Alcazar from The Broken Ear , and Bianca Castafiore from King Ottokar 's Sceptre . 
 The scenery and background of the story was meticulously copied from existing sources ; car model types like the Opel Olympia 38 in which Calculus ' abductors escaped the police were drawn from real examples , while Hergé closely adhered to the reality of the port and docks at Saint @-@ Nazaire . Professor Tarragon 's house was drawn from a real house in Avenue Delleur , Boitsfort , which Jacobs had identified for Hergé 's purposes . Hergé and Jacobs stationed themselves outside the house and completed a sketch of the building . Immediately after , two grey cars containing German soldiers pulled up ; the house had been requisitioned by the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) . Hergé realised that , had he and Jacobs been discovered sketching , they would have been interrogated .

 The story began serialisation in Le Soir under the title of Les Sept Boules de Cristal on 16 December 1943 . However , Hergé 's health declined , as he was afflicted with flu , sinusitis , and ear ache . This was accompanied by general exhaustion , depression , and fear that upon the imminent collapse of German administration , he would face retribution as a collaborator ; many accused of being collaborators had already been killed by the Belgian Resistance . Experiencing a breakdown , he took a hiatus from producing The Seven Crystal Balls between 6 May and 6 July 1944 , during which a message was posted in Le Soir stating : 
 They 're coming ! Who ? Why , Tintin and Snowy , of course ! Perhaps , since you have not heard anything about them lately , you have been afraid , dear readers , that something bad had happened to them ? Nothing of the sort ! Tintin and Snowy were simply waiting for our excellent associate and friend Hergé to return to better health , as he was sick for a few weeks . 
 The story returned to its serialisation in Le Soir on 7 July , starting with a summary of the story so far . However , it would be interrupted again on 2 September 1944 . Brussels was liberated from German occupation by the Allied forces on 3 September , upon which Le Soir immediately ceased publication . Hergé had been forced to abandon the story after 152 strips , equivalent to fifty pages of the later published book volume . The story had been left hanging after the scene in which Tintin leaves the hospital after seeing the seven members of the expedition having a simultaneous fit . Three days later the entire staff were fired and a new editorial team introduced . 
 Hergé was arrested on 3 September , having been named as a collaborator in a Resistance document known as the " Gallery of Traitors " . This would be the first of four incidents in which Hergé was arrested and freed : by the State Security , the Judiciary Police , the Belgian National Movement , and the Front for Independence , during which he spent one night in jail . On 8 September the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force issued a proclamation announcing that " any journalist who had helped produce a newspaper during the occupation was for the time being barred from practising his profession . " Blacklisted , Hergé was now unemployed . A newspaper closely associated with the Belgian Resistance , La Patrie , issued a strip titled The Adventures of Tintin in the Land of the Nazis , in which Hergé was lampooned as a collaborator . 
 The period witnessed widespread allegations against accused collaborators , with military courts condemning 30 @,@ 000 on minor charges and 25 @,@ 000 on more serious charges ; of those , 5 @,@ 500 were sentenced to life imprisonment or capital punishment . A judiciary inquiry into Hergé 's case was launched by the deputy public prosecutor , Mr <unk> , although in his report he urged lenience , stating that " I am inclined to close the case . I believe it would bring ridicule on the judicial system to go after an inoffensive children 's book author and illustrator . On the other hand , Hergé worked for Le Soir during the war , and his illustrations are what made people buy the newspaper . " Unable to work for the press , Hergé worked from home re @-@ drawing , and Jacobs colouring , the older Adventures of Tintin for publication by his book publisher Casterman , completing the second version of Tintin in the Congo and starting on King Ottokar 's Sceptre . Casterman supported Hergé throughout his ordeal , for which he always remained grateful . He and Jacobs produced a comic strip under the pseudonym of " Olav " , although no publishers accepted it . Although this period allowed him an escape from the pressure of daily production which had affected most of his working life , he also had family problems to deal with ; his brother Paul returned to Brussels from a German prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp and their mother had become highly delusional and was moved to a psychiatric hospital . 
 In October 1945 , Hergé was approached by Raymond Leblanc , a former member of a conservative Resistance group , the National Royalist Movement ( MNR ) , and his associates André Sinave and Albert Debaty . The trio were planning on launching a weekly magazine for children . Leblanc , who had fond childhood memories of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets , thought Hergé would be ideal for it . Hergé agreed , and Leblanc obtained clearance papers for him , allowing him to work . Concerned about the judicial investigation into Hergé 's wartime affiliations , Leblanc convinced William Ugeux , a leader of the Belgian Resistance who was now in charge of censorship and certificates of good citizenship , to look into the comic creator 's file . Ugeux concluded that Hergé had been " a <unk> rather than a traitor " for his work at Le Soir . The decision whether Hergé would stand trial belonged to the general auditor of the Military Tribunal , Walter Ganshof van der Meersch . He closed the case on 22 December 1945 , declaring that " in regard to the particularly inoffensive character of the drawings published by Remi , bringing him before a war tribunal would be inappropriate and risky " . 
 Now free from threat of prosecution , he continued to support his colleagues at Le Soir who were being charged as collaborators ; six of them were sentenced to death , and others to lengthy prison sentences . Among those sentenced to death was Hergé 's friend , Paul Jamin , although his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment . In May 1946 , Hergé was issued a certificate of good citizenship , which became largely necessary to obtain employment in post @-@ war Belgium . Celebrations were marred by his mother 's death at age 60 in April 1946 . Harry Thompson has described this post @-@ war period as the " greatest upheaval " of Hergé 's life . Hergé later described it as " an experience of absolute intolerance . It was horrible , horrible ! " He considered the post @-@ war trials of collaborators a great injustice inflicted upon many innocent people , and never forgave Belgian society for the way that he had been treated , although he hid this from his public persona . 
 Leblanc 's new magazine was titled Tintin at the advice of Sinave , who believed that this would help attract a wide audience . Adopting the slogan of " The Newspaper for the Young Aged 7 to 77 " , the magazine 's logo featured the Tintin character himself . Inspired by the example set by Le Petit Vingtième , Tintin magazine was to be a weekly , centred on the eponymous hero . The Adventures of Tintin would be serialised two pages per week , accompanied by other Franco @-@ Belgian comics . For the first time , the Adventures would be in colour from the outset . Hergé assembled a team of artists for the purpose , including Edgar P. Jacobs and Jacques Van Melkebeke , who became the magazine 's first editor . Hergé continued at the point where he had left The Seven Crystal Balls , prior to embarking on Prisoners of the Sun , although both were published under the title of Le Temple du Soleil ( The Temple of the Sun ) . Rather than re @-@ serialising the story from its beginning , he began the new magazine with a summary of the story so far , presented as a press clipping . The magazine was an instant success , soon gaining a weekly circulation of 100 @,@ 000 in Belgium and the Netherlands . The Seven Crystal Balls serialisation finally concluded on 22 April 1948 , four and a half years after it had begun .

 As with previous adventures , it then began serialisation in the French Catholic newspaper Cœurs Vaillants , from 19 May 1946 . After the story had finished serialisation , the publishing company Casterman divided it into two volumes , Les Sept Boules de Cristal and Le Temple du Soleil , which they released in 1948 and 1949 respectively . One of the scenes that had been found in Le Soir , in which Haddock is humiliated by the clairvoyant at the theatre , was removed from the story when it was being reformatted in book form . The book contained additional backgrounds not found in the original serialised story which had been drawn by Jacobs . 
 When translated into English for a publication by Methuen in 1963 , a number of Francophone place @-@ names were changed ; for instance , the port of Saint @-@ Nazaire was renamed <unk> , which , according to author Michael Farr , was probably inspired by the real English coastal town of Weymouth . As the English @-@ language translation was published after the English translation of other Tintin adventures , which had actually been authored later than The Seven Crystal Balls , in the English version , references are made to events that would occur in The Calculus Affair and The Red Sea Sharks . 
 = = Critical analysis = = 
 Biographer Benoît Peeters described The Seven Crystal Balls as " the most terrifying of The Adventures of Tintin " . He believed that in this story , Hergé had come under the clear influence of Jacobs , in that the " décor grows more lush ; the details clearer . No more streets suggested by a few lines , monochromatic posters , or characters walking on the edge of the frame . " Elsewhere , he noted that in this story , Hergé " produced a gripping tale that went further than any other in the direction of the supernatural . " Fellow biographer Pierre Assouline believed that The Seven Crystal Balls achieved " a more complete integration of narrative and illustrations " than previous adventures , and that from that point on , his books " begin to form a coherent body of work , an oeuvre . " 
 Harry Thompson stated that the " overriding theme " of The Seven Crystal Balls was " fear of the unknown " , adding that while it did blend humour with menace , it remained " Hergé 's most frightening book " . He noted that the story marks the complete transition of Captain Haddock from the " pitiable drunk " which he was introduced as in The Crab with the Golden Claws to the position of " chief sidekick and comic attraction " , with Snowy being relegated to the position of " normal dog " . 
 Michael Farr described both The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun as " classic middle @-@ period Tintin " , commenting on their " surprisingly well @-@ balanced narrative " and noting that they exhibited scant evidence of Hergé 's turbulent personal life . He felt that The Seven Crystal Balls encapsulated the " air of doom " which pervaded the mood of Europe at the time to an even greater extent than Hergé had done in his earlier work , The Shooting Star . At the same time , Farr thought it to be " a simple detective story " , comparing Tintin 's hunt for clues regarding Calculus ' disappearance to Arthur Conan Doyle 's stories of fictional detective Sherlock Holmes . He thought that the story was " truly Hitchcockian in its suspense and quite cinematic in its presentation " , comparing the use of the music hall in the story with its use in Hitchcock 's film , The 39 Steps ( 1935 ) . Farr suggested that in the scene in which Haddock dejectedly sits around Marlinspike awaiting news of Calculus , " Hergé had allowed himself to step for a moment into Haddock 's shoes and to be autobiographical " . 
 Jean @-@ Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier believed that the two @-@ story arc represents " one more leap forward in Hergé 's graphic and narrative skills " as a result of the transition to full colour double pages as the initial means of publication . They noted that The Seven Crystal Balls is " bathed in the surreal atmosphere that Hergé knew how to create so well " , with Tintin confronting " a dark and oppressive force " that was " worthy of a Hammer film . " They asserted that the character of Professor Tarragon was " to archaeology what Haddock is to the sea " , adding that Mark Falconer ( Marc Chalet ) resembled an older Tintin with darker hair . Ultimately , they awarded both halves of the story arc five out of five . 
 Literary critic Tom McCarthy praised the character of Tarragon , stating that he exudes a presence " far beyond what we might expect from a novelist , let alone a cartoonist " . He then compared the scenario in which Tarragon was trapped within his home to that in The Calculus Affair in which Professor Topolino was tied up in his house . He also identified elements within the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within The Adventures of Tintin . He argued that the way in which Alcazar was presented as Tintin 's friend in this story was a manifestation of the recurring theme of friendship . He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac 's jewels reflected Hergé 's use of jewels as a theme throughout the series , while the mummy 's removal from its tomb was a manifestation of the recurring concept of the tomb . 
 In his psychoanalytical study of the Adventures of Tintin , the academic Jean @-@ Marie Apostolidès believed that The Seven Crystal Balls @-@ Prisoners of the Sun arc reflects a confrontation between civilisations , and between the sacred and the secular . He also discussed Haddock 's position in the story , noting that the scene at the theatre in which a bull 's head mask falls onto Haddock 's head reflects " one of Hergé 's most constant themes : the union of human and animal " . He further added the opinion that Haddock 's transformation from seaman to country gentleman was not believable . He suggested that the appearance of Yamila and Castafiore at the start of the story injected " a feminine element " into the story , which represented an attempt to " round out Haddock 's family " , which was dominated by the male figures of Tintin , Calculus , and Snowy . He further argued that Calculus ' kidnapping represented a " rite of passage " that would allow him to join Tintin and Haddock 's family . 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 In 1969 , the animation company Belvision Studios , which had produced the 1956 – 57 television series Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin , released its first feature @-@ length animated film , Tintin and the Temple of the Sun , adapted from the Seven Crystal Balls @-@ Prisoners of the Sun story arc . Produced by Raymond Leblanc and directed by Eddie Lateste , it was written by Lateste , the cartoonist Greg , Jos <unk> , and <unk> Molnár . Music was by François Rauber and Zorrino 's song was composed by Jacques Brel . Lofficier and Lofficier commented that the part of the film based on The Seven Crystal Balls " suffers from being overly condensed for timing reasons . " 
 In 1991 , a second animated series based upon The Adventures of Tintin was produced , this time as a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana . The Seven Crystal Balls was the eleventh story to be adapted and was divided into two thirty @-@ minute episodes . Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi , the series has been praised for being " generally faithful " to the original comics , to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Hergé 's original panels . 
 The video game Prisoners of the Sun was developed and published by the French company Infogrames in 1997 , based on The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun . 
 At the turn of the new century , Tintin remained popular . In 2001 , The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun were adapted into a theatrical musical , Kuifje – De Zonnetempel ( Tintin – The Temple of the Sun ) , which premiered at the Stadsschouwburg in Antwerp in the Dutch language on 15 September . The production , directed by Dirk de <unk> , adapted by Seth <unk> and Frank Van <unk> with music by Dirk <unk> , featured Tom Van <unk> as Tintin . The musical was adapted by Didier Van <unk> into French and premiered a year later in Charleroi as Tintin – Le Temple du Soleil . From there , the production was scheduled for Paris in 2003 but was cancelled . It returned for a brief run in Antwerp on 18 October 2007 . 
 = Unlocked ( Alexandra Stan album ) = 
 Unlocked is the second studio album recorded by Romanian recording artist Alexandra Stan . It was made available for digital download on 27 August 2014 through Victor Entertainment as a follow @-@ up to her 2011 album , Saxobeats , and its reissue , Cliché ( Hush Hush ) ( 2013 ) . Stan collaborated with several record producers on this album , including Andreas Schuller , Sebastian <unk> , <unk> Prince , Erik Lidbom and Gabriel <unk> . She also took part at the FonoCamp 2013 , the first international songwriting camp held in Romania , where she further worked on material featured on this album . Unlocked premiered following an alleged physical altercation with her former manager , Marcel Prodan , over compensation , which caused Stan 's short career hiatus in 2013 . 
 The music of Unlocked draws from the EDM and dance @-@ pop styles of her previous material , while also incorporating different forms of instrumentation from her previous releases , such as Bhangra and Caucasian music in the songs " Kiss Me Goodbye " and " Give Me Your Everything " , respectively . Lyrically , the album approaches themes that delve on issuance , retrieval and a new beginning , while also speaking on Stan 's volatile relationship with her unidentified boyfriend . The record received generally positive reviews from music critics , many of whom praising its material for being " catchy " and " infectious " . Unlocked also drew comparisons to the works of American singer Britney Spears , Barbadian recording artist Rihanna and Australian performer Sia . 
 Upon its release , Unlocked debuted and peaked at number 21 on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart , selling 3 @,@ 859 copies in its first week of release . As of September 2014 , the album has sold more than 17 @,@ 000 units , according to the Recording Industry Association of Japan ( RIAJ ) . Six tracks from the album were released as singles , of which three ( " Cherry Pop " , " Dance " and " We Wanna " ) charted on the Japan Hot 100 . " Dance " reached the top 10 in Turkey , while " We Wanna " reached the top thirty in Argentina , Poland and Turkey , and the top sixty in Italy , Romania and Slovakia . To promote Unlocked , Stan embarked on two tours throughout 2014 , Cherry Pop Summer Tour and Unlocked Tour , in Russia , Mexico , Japan and Turkey .

 Shortly after releasing her debut album Saxobeats ( 2011 ) which featured her worldwide breakthrough single , " Mr. Saxobeat " , Stan started to work on new material for a new record with Marcel Prodan and Andrei Nemirschi , her long @-@ time composers and managers . " Lemonade " , " Cliché ( Hush Hush ) " and " All My People " were subsequently released worldwide as singles through 2012 and 2013 , and were intended for her then @-@ untitled second studio album . The album was intended for a September 2013 release , but following an alleged physical altercation with her former manager Prodan over compensation , the recording was delayed . Following this , Stan accused him of physically attacking and blackmailing her . After her recovery , Stan was sued by Prodan for using his songs in her live performances without his permission . Stan won the copyright battle in June 2014 . Cliché ( Hush Hush ) , Stan 's last album under Prodan 's label , Maan Records , was released in October 2013 . It was a re @-@ issue of Saxobeats with the addition of the three songs intended for Stan 's second studio album . Cliché ( Hush Hush ) was only released in Japan ; it failed to gain much success , although it did enter the top sixty on the Oricon Albums Chart . In late 2013 , Stan continued the work on her second studio album with a new team , including record producers and songwriters Alex Cotoi and Erik Lidbom . She also switched from Prodan 's label and signed a new deal with Fonogram Records . " Thanks for Leaving " , the first single from Unlocked , was released on 28 April 2014 . In the following four months , Stan released three more singles , " Cherry Pop " , " Dance " and " Give Me Your Everything " , under Roton and Fonogram Records . Stan took part at the FonoCamp 2013 , the first international songwriting camp in Romania , held in Azuga , where she further worked on Unlocked with fellow Romanian singers and producers . 
 = = Recordings and artwork = = 
 Stan was involved in the writing process of all the songs featured on Unlocked , with the exception of " Thanks for Leaving " , " Set Me Free " and " Trumpet Blows " . During interviews , she expressed that the lyrical content of " Thanks for Leaving " refers to her recovery following her violent incident with Prodan , making the song very personal to her . The music of Unlocked drew influences by several <unk> and <unk> , including dance , techno , pop , rhythm and blues , EDM , Bhangra , Caucasian @-@ flavoured music and German club music . Lyrically , the album revolves around Stan 's relationship with her love interest and approaches themes such as issuance , retrieval and a new beginning . " Vanilla Chocolat " and " We Wanna " feature lyrics written in French and Spanish , respectively . The official cover sleeve for Unlocked was a photograph by Dimitri <unk> and shows Stan sporting a multicoloured jacket and standing in front of a neon light . An alternative artwork for the Japanese edition of the album portrayed her in sepia , with only one of her eyes being visible , as the left one is covered by her hair .

 = History of Pittsburgh = 
 The history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region . Eventually French and British explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio , which leads to the Mississippi River . The area became a battleground when France and Britain fought for control in the 1750s . When the British were victorious , the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi . 
 Following American independence in 1783 , the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow . The region saw the short @-@ lived Whiskey Rebellion , when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey . The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods , stimulating American manufacture . By 1815 , Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron , brass , tin , and glass products . By the 1840s , Pittsburgh had grown to one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains . Production of steel began in 1875 . During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 . Workers protested cuts in wages , burning down buildings at the railyards , including 100 train engines and more than 1 @,@ 000 cars . Forty men were killed , most of them strikers . By 1911 , Pittsburgh was producing half the nation 's steel . Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932 . The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression , the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors . In World War II , it was the center of the " Arsenal of Democracy " , producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned . 
 Following World War II , Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the " Renaissance . " The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s , but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry , with massive layoffs and mill closures . Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s . In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub . The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2 @.@ 4 million ; it is 65 % white and 35 % minority . 
 = = Native American era = = 
 For thousands of years , Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio . Paleo @-@ Indians conducted a hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19 @,@ 000 years ago . <unk> Rockshelter , an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh , provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date . During the Adena culture that followed , Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of <unk> Rocks , about three miles ( 5 km ) from the head of the Ohio . The Indian Mound , a burial site , was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture . 
 By 1700 the Iroquois Confederacy , the Five Nations @-@ based south of the Great Lakes in present @-@ day New York , held dominion over the upper Ohio valley , reserving it for hunting grounds . Other tribes included the Lenape ( known by the English as Delaware ) , who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement , and the Shawnee , who had migrated up from the south . With the arrival of European explorers , these tribes and others had been devastated by European infectious diseases , such as smallpox , measles , influenza , and malaria , to which they had no immunity . 
 In 1748 , when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown , 18 miles ( 29 km ) downriver from Pittsburgh , he counted 789 warriors gathered : the Iroquois included 163 Seneca , 74 Mohawk , 35 Onondaga , 20 Cayuga , and 15 Oneida . Other tribes were 165 Lenape , 162 Shawnee , 100 Wyandot , 40 <unk> , and 15 Mohican . 
 <unk> 's Town , a Seneca tribe village on the east bank of the Allegheny , was the home village of Queen <unk> . It was deserted after 1749 . <unk> , on the mouth of the Beaver River , was a Lenape ( Delaware ) settlement and the principal residence of <unk> , a chief of theirs . Chartier 's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier . Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny , with an estimated 300 – 400 residents . 
 = = Early colonization ( 1747 – 1763 ) = = 
 The first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders . Michael <unk> was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717 , and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area . Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748 , when the first Ohio Company , an English land speculation company , won a grant of 200 @,@ 000 acres ( 800 km ² ) in the upper Ohio Valley . From a post at present @-@ day Cumberland , Maryland , the company began to construct an 80 @-@ mile ( 130 km ) wagon road to the Monongahela River employing a Delaware Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt. Michael Cresap to begin widening the track into a road . It mostly followed the same route as an ancient Amerindian trail which is now known as Nemacolin 's Trail . The river crossing and flats at Redstone creek , was the earliest point and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road . Later in the war , the site fortified as Fort Burd ( now Brownsville ) was one of several possible destinations . Another alternative was the divergent route that became Braddock 's Road a few years later through present @-@ day New Stanton . In the event , the colonists did not succeed in improving the Amerindian path to a wagon road much beyond the Cumberland Narrows pass before they were confronted by hostile Native Americans . The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track . 
 The French had built nearby Logstown as a trade and council center for the Native Americans to increase their influence in the Ohio Valley . Between June 15 and November 10 , 1749 , an expedition headed by <unk> de Bienville , a French officer , traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region . De Bienville warned away English traders and posted markers claiming the territory . 
 In 1753 , Marquis Duquesne , the Governor of New France , sent another , larger expedition . At present @-@ day Erie , Pennsylvania , an advance party built Fort Presque Isle . They also cut a road through the woods and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek , from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny . By summer , an expedition of 1 @,@ 500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny . Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny . The following year , they built Fort <unk> at that site . 
 Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley , Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent Major George Washington to warn the French to withdraw . Accompanied by Christopher Gist , Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25 , 1753 . 
 Proceeding up the Allegheny , Washington presented Dinwiddie 's letter to the French commanders first at Venango , and then Fort Le Boeuf . The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy , but did not withdraw . 
 Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio . On February 17 , 1754 , Trent began construction of the fort , the first European habitation at the site of present @-@ day Pittsburgh . The fort , named Fort Prince George , was only half @-@ built by April 1754 , when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40 @-@ some colonials back to Virginia . The French tore down the British fortification and built Fort Duquesne . 
 Governor Dinwiddie launched another expedition . Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second @-@ in @-@ command , George Washington , leading an advance column . On May 28 , 1754 , Washington 's unit clashed with the French in the Battle of Jumonville Glen , during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner . After the battle , Washington 's ally , Seneca chief <unk> , unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer , Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville . The French pursued Washington and on July 3 , 1754 , George Washington surrendered following the Battle of Fort Necessity . These frontier actions contributed to the start of the French and Indian War ( 1754 – 1763 ) , or , the Seven Years ' War , an imperial confrontation between England and France fought in both hemispheres . 
 In 1755 , George Washington accompanied British General Braddock 's expedition . Two regiments marched from Fort Cumberland across the Allegheny Mountains and into western Pennsylvania . Following a path Washington surveyed , over 3 @,@ 000 men built a wagon road 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) wide , that when complete , was the first road to cross the Appalachian Mountains . Braddock 's Road , as it was known , blazed the way for the future National Road ( <unk> ) . The expedition crossed the Monongahela River on July 9 , 1755 . French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock 's expedition at Braddock 's Field , nine miles ( 14 km ) from Fort Duquesne . In the Battle of the Monongahela , the French inflicted heavy losses on the British , and Braddock was mortally wounded . The surviving British and colonial forces retreated . This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley . 
 On September 8 , 1756 , an expedition of 300 militiamen destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of Kittanning , and in the summer of 1758 , British General John Forbes began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne . At the head of 7 @,@ 000 regular and colonial troops , Forbes built Fort Ligonier and Fort Bedford , from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains , later known as Forbes ' Road . On the night of September 13 – 14 , 1758 , an advance column under Major James Grant was massacred in the Battle of Fort Duquesne . The battleground , the high hill east of the Point , was named Grant 's Hill in his memory . With this defeat , Forbes decided to wait until spring . But when he heard that the French had lost Fort Frontenac and largely evacuated Fort Duquesne , he planned an immediate attack . Hopelessly outnumbered , the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne . Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25 , 1758 and ordered the construction of Fort Pitt , named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder . He also named the settlement between the rivers , " <unk> " ( see Etymology of Pittsburgh ) . The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification . The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the Treaty of Paris and French defeat . They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River . 
 = = Gateway to the West ( 1763 – 1799 ) = = 
 In 1760 , the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow . Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins , the " lower town , " near the fort 's ramparts , and the " upper town , " along the Monongahela as far as present @-@ day Market Street . In April 1761 , a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet counted 332 people and 104 houses . 
 In a final Native American attempt to drive out the British west of the Appalachians , Pontiac 's Rebellion began with an assault on British forts in May 1763 . Ohio Valley and Great Lakes tribes overran many forts ; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt . Receiving warning of the coming attack , Captain Simeon Ecuyer , the Swiss officer in command of the garrison , prepared for a siege . He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort : 330 men , 104 women , and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts . Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores , which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef . Pontiac 's forces attacked the fort on June 22 , 1763 . The siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months . Pontiac 's warriors kept up a continuous , though ineffective , fire on it from July 27 through August 1 , 1763 . They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet , which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run . This victory sealed British dominion over the forks of the Ohio , if not the entire Ohio valley . In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt , the Fort Pitt Blockhouse , which still stands , the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains . 
 The Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768 , ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British . European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased . An estimated 4 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770 . Of these settlers , about a third were English , a third were Scotch @-@ Irish , and the rest were Welsh , German and others . These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities , but often their households were not within hailing distance . The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work : clearing the forest , stumping the fields , building cabins and barns , planting , weeding , and harvesting . In addition , almost everything was manufactured by hand , including furniture , tools , candles , buttons , and needles . Settlers had to deal with harsh winters , and with snakes , black bears , mountain lions , and timber wolves . Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans , the settlers often built their cabins near , or even on top of , springs , to ensure access to water . They also built blockhouses , where neighbors would rally during conflicts . 
 Increasing violence , especially by the Shawnee , Miami , and Wyandot tribes , led to Dunmore 's War in 1774 . Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the American Revolution , as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory . In 1777 , Fort Pitt became a United States fort , when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command . In 1779 , Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny . 
 With the war still ongoing , in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders , creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian . In 1783 , the Revolutionary War ended , which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare . In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix , the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania . 
 After the Revolution , the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow . One of its earliest industries was boat building . <unk> could used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver , while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver . 
 The village began to develop vital institutions . Hugh Henry Brackenridge , a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator , introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28 , 1787 . The Academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania ( 1819 ) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh . 
 Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey , increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs . At that time , whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier . When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey , Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized , leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 . Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock 's Field and marched on Pittsburgh . The short @-@ lived rebellion was put down , however , when President George Washington sent in militias from several states . 
 The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability . In 1792 , the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop , Western Experiment . During the next decades , the yards produced other large boats . By the 19th century , they were building ocean @-@ going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe . In 1794 , the town 's first courthouse was built ; it was a wooden structure on Market Square . In 1797 , the manufacture of glass began . 
 = = Iron City ( 1800 – 1859 ) = = 
 Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh , but increasingly , manufacture began to grow in importance . Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country ; the region was also rich in petroleum , natural gas , lumber , and farm goods . Blacksmiths forged iron implements , from horse shoes to nails . By 1800 , the town , with a population of 1 @,@ 565 persons , had over 60 shops , including general stores , bakeries , and hat and shoe shops . 
 The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh 's growth . In 1811 , the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh . Increasingly , commerce would also flow upriver . The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City . The war with Britain , the manufacturing center of the world , cut off the supply of British goods , stimulating American manufacture . Also , the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade , so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions . By 1815 , Pittsburgh was producing $ <unk> in iron ; $ <unk> in brass and tin , and $ <unk> in glass products . When , on March 18 , 1816 , Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city , it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics : commerce , manufacture , and a constant cloud of coal dust . 
 Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh . In 1818 , the first segment of the National Road was completed , from Baltimore to Wheeling , bypassing Pittsburgh . This threatened to render the town less essential in east @-@ west commerce . In the coming decade , however , many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure . In 1818 , the region 's first river bridge , the Smithfield Street Bridge , opened , the first step in developing the " City of bridges " over its two rivers . On October 1 , 1840 , the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed , connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia . In 1834 , the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal was completed , making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers , roads , and canals . 
 Manufacture continued to grow . In 1835 , McClurg , Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies . Already , Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age . By the 1840s , Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains . In 1841 , the Second Court House , on Grant 's Hill , was completed . Made from polished gray sandstone , the court house had a rotunda 60 feet ( 18 m ) in diameter and 80 feet ( 24 m ) high . 
 Like many burgeoning cities of its day , Pittsburgh 's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure , such as a water supply with dependable pressure . Because of this , on April 10 , 1845 , a great fire burned out of control , destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $ 9M in damages . As the city rebuilt , the age of rails arrived . In 1851 , the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City ( present @-@ day North Side ) . In 1854 , the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia . 
 Despite many challenges , Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse . An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City : 
 939 factories in Pittsburgh and Allegheny City 
 employing more than 10K workers 
 producing almost $ 12M in goods 
 using 400 steam engines 
 Total coal consumed — 22M bushels 
 Total iron consumed — <unk> tons 
 In steam tonnage , third busiest port in the nation , surpassed only by New York City and New Orleans .

 The iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s . 
 = = = Scotch Irish leadership = = = 
 Ingham ( 1978 ) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center , Pittsburgh , as well as smaller cities . He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was " largely Scotch Irish " . Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and " developed their own sense of uniqueness . " 
 Indeed , new immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch Irish stronghold . For example , Thomas Mellon ( b . Ulster 1813 – 1908 ) left Ireland in 1823 and became the founder of the famous Mellon family , which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil . As <unk> ( 2005 ) finds , industrialists like James H. Laughlin ( b . Ulster 1806 – 1882 ) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the " Scots @-@ Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society . " 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 In 1859 , the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke @-@ fire smelting to the region . The American Civil War boosted the city 's economy with increased production of iron and armaments , especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry . Arms manufacture included iron @-@ clad warships and the world 's first 21 " gun . By war 's end , over one @-@ half of the steel and more than one @-@ third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh . A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875 , when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process . 
 <unk> such as Andrew Carnegie , Henry Clay Frick , Andrew W. Mellon , and Charles M. Schwab built their fortunes in Pittsburgh . Also based in Pittsburgh was George Westinghouse , credited with such advancements as the air brake and founder of over 60 companies , including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company ( 1869 ) , Union Switch & Signal ( 1881 ) , and Westinghouse Electric Company ( 1886 ) . Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh 's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants , integrate industries and fund technological advances . For example , T. Mellon & Sons Bank , founded in 1869 , helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa . 
 Ingham ( 1991 ) shows how small , independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s , despite competition from much larger , standardized production firms . These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community . Small firms concentrated on specialized products , particularly structural steel , where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage . They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms . They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass @-@ production counterparts . 
 = = = Geography of industrialization = = = 
 Beginning in the 1870s , entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small , craft @-@ organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County . The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills , mass production , and modern management organization in steel and other industries . Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility . They purchased land , designed modern plants , and sometimes built towns for workers . Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures . Some owners removed their plants from the central city 's labor unions to exert greater control over workers . The region 's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal . The rapid growth of steel , glass , railroad equipment , and coke industries resulted in both large mass @-@ production plants and numerous smaller firms . As capital deepened and interdependence grew , participants multiplied , economies accrued , the division of labor increased , and localized production systems formed around these industries . Transportation , capital , labor markets , and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district . By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city , surrounded by proximate residential communities , mill towns , satellite cities , and hundreds of mining towns . 
 Representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift , according to Mosher ( 1995 ) . Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension , Pittsburgh <unk> George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted 's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town . McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism , with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers ; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers . A strike and lockout at McMurtry 's steelworks in Apollo , Pennsylvania , prompted him to build the new town . Wanting a loyal workforce , he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital 's treatment of labor . The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform , comprehensive infrastructure planning , and private homeownership principles . The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry 's skilled workers and led to McMurtry 's greatest success . In 1901 he used Vandergrift 's worker @-@ residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation .

 During the mid @-@ 19th century , Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants , including a brick mason whose son , Henry J. Heinz , founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1872 . Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity , working conditions , hours , and wages , but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union . 
 = = = Labor unions = = = 
 As a manufacturing center , Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife . During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 , Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence , known as the Pittsburgh Railway Riots . Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike . Forty men died , most of them workers , and more than 40 buildings were burned down , including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad . Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock : more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed . It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes . 
 In 1892 , a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths ( 3 detectives , 7 workers ) when Carnegie Steel Company 's manager Henry Clay Frick sent in Pinkertons to break the Homestead Strike . Labor strife continued into the years of the Great Depression , as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions . Unions organized H.J. Heinz workers , with the assistance of the Catholic Radical Alliance . 
 = = = Carnegie = = = 
 Andrew Carnegie , an immigrant from Scotland , a former Pennsylvania Railroad executive turned steel magnate , founded the Carnegie Steel Company . He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry . He became a philanthropist : in 1890 , he established the first Carnegie Library , in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds . In 1895 , he founded the Carnegie Institute . In 1901 , as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed , he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $ 250 million , making him one of the world 's richest men . Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich , dies disgraced . He devoted the rest of his life to public service , establishing libraries , trusts , and foundations . In Pittsburgh , he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology ( now Carnegie Mellon University ) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh . 
 The third ( and present ) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886 . In 1890 , trolleys began operations . In 1907 , Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City , which is now known as the North Shore .

 During the Prohibition era , 1920 to 1933 , Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption . Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition , including a large immigrant population , anti @-@ establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion , fragmented local government , and pervasive corruption . The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade .

 During the late 19th century , city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage . Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh 's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River . Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939 . Pittsburgh 's smoke pollution , seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity , was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s – 1940s . With little regard for beauty , steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972 , especially in Nine Mile Run Valley . 
 In November 1927 , 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank . 
 To escape the soot of the city , many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods , a few miles east of downtown . Fifth Avenue was dubbed " Millionaire 's Row " because of the many mansions lining the street . 
 On March 17 and 18 , 1936 , Pittsburgh witnessed the worst flood in its history , with flood levels peaking at 46 feet . This catastrophe killed 69 victims , destroyed thousands of buildings , caused $ 3B ( 2006 dollars ) in damages , and put over 60 @,@ 000 steelworkers out of work .

 Oakland became the city 's predominant cultural and educational center , including three universities , multiple museums , a library , a music hall , and a botanical conservatory . Oakland 's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world 's second @-@ tallest educational building , the 42 @-@ story Cathedral of Learning . It towered over Forbes Field , where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 – 1970 . 
 = = = New immigrants = = = 
 Between 1870 and 1920 , the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold . Many of the new residents were immigrants who sought employment in the factories and mills and introduced new traditions , languages , and cultures to the city . Ethnic neighborhoods emerged on densely populated hillsides and valleys , such as South Side , Polish Hill , Bloomfield , and Squirrel Hill , home to 28 % of the city 's almost 21 @,@ 000 Jewish households . The Strip District , the city 's produce distribution center , still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of <unk> . 
 The years 1916 – 1930 marked the largest migration of African @-@ Americans to Pittsburgh . Known as the cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh , Wylie Avenue in the Hill District was an important jazz mecca . Jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Billy Strayhorn and Earl Hines played there . Two of the Negro League 's greatest rivals , the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays , often competed in the Hill District . The teams dominated the Negro National League in the 1930s and 1940s . 
 = = = 1930s = = = 
 Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s , and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes . But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city . The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance . As the Depression worsened , Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats , especially in 1934 , making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition . By 1936 , Democratic programs for relief and jobs , especially the WPA , were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats . 
 Joseph Guffey , statewide leader of the Democrats , and his local lieutenant David Lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt 's landslide in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933 . Guffey and Lawrence used the New Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine . Guffey himself acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only " a challenge " but also " an opportunity . " He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage .

 Pittsburgh was at the center of the " Arsenal of Democracy " that provided steel , aluminum , munitions and machinery for the U.S. and the Allies during World War II . Pittsburgh 's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort . 
 = = = Postwar = = = 
 David Lawrence , a Democrat , served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania 's governor from 1959 to 1963 . Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh 's political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly . In 1946 Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city 's future economic development . However , enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city 's working @-@ class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels . One round of protests came from Italian @-@ American organizations , which called for delay in enforcing it . Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines . Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program , Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949 , in part because many of them were on the city payroll .

 Rich and productive , Pittsburgh was also the " Smoky City , " with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day as well as rivers that resembled open sewers . Civic leaders , notably Mayor David L. Lawrence , elected in 1945 , Richard K. Mellon , chairman of Mellon Bank and John P. Robin began smoke control and urban revitalization , also known as Urban Renewal projects that transformed the city in unforeseen ways . 
 " Renaissance I " began in 1946 . Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin . By 1950 , vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center . 1953 saw the opening of the ( since demolished ) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal . 
 In the late 1950s and early 1960s , the lower Hill District , an area inhabited predominantly by people of African descent , was completely destroyed . Ninety @-@ five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain , forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8 @,@ 000 people ( 1 @,@ 239 black families , 312 white ) , to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena , which opened in 1961 . Other than one apartment building , none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built . 
 In the early 1960s , the neighborhood of East Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans , with over 125 acres ( 0 @.@ 51 km2 ) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments , three 20 @-@ story public housing apartments , and a convoluted road @-@ way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district . In the span of just a few years during the mid @-@ 1960s , East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood . There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959 , but only 292 in 1970 , and just 98 in 1979 . 
 Preservation efforts by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation , along with community neighborhood groups , resisted the demolition plans . The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage , including the Mexican War Streets , Allegheny West , and Manchester , were spared . The center of Allegheny City , with its culturally and socially important buildings , was not as lucky . All of the buildings , with the exception of the Old U.S. Post Office , the Carnegie Library , and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the " pedestrianized " Allegheny Center Mall and apartments . 
 The city 's industrial base continued to grow in the post @-@ war era partly assisted by the area 's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development , the <unk> . Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside . H.J. Heinz , Pittsburgh Plate Glass , Alcoa , Westinghouse , U.S. Steel and its new division , the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s . 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I : the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium . In 1974 , with the addition of the fountain at the tip of the Golden Triangle , Point State Park was completed . Although air quality was dramatically improved , and Pittsburgh 's manufacturing base seemed solid , questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh . Pittsburgh , however , was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations . 
 Like most major cities , Pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following the assassination of Martin Luther King in April 1968 . There were no further major riots , although tension remained high in the inner @-@ city black neighborhoods . 
 = = Reinvention ( 1973 – present ) = = 
 During the 1970s and 1980s , the U.S. steel industry came under increasing pressure from foreign competition and from American mini @-@ mills that had much lower overhead by using salvaged steel . Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming . Foreign mills and factories , built with the latest technology , benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government @-@ corporate partnerships , allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products . Separately , demand for steel softened due to recessions , the 1973 oil crisis , and increasing use of other materials . The era began with the <unk> 's " Building on Basics " report in 1974 . 
 = = = Collapse of steel = = = 
 Free market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry 's own internal problems , which included a now @-@ outdated manufacturing base that had been over @-@ expanded in the 1950s and 1960s , hostile management and labor relationships , the inflexibility of United Steelworkers regarding wage cuts and work @-@ rule reforms , oligarchic management styles , and poor strategic planning by both unions and management . In particular , Pittsburgh faced its own challenges . Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted , raising material costs . The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer , more profitable " mini @-@ mills " and non @-@ union mills with lower labor costs . 
 Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s , the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981 – 1982 recession , for example , the mills laid off 153 @,@ 000 workers . The steel mills began to shut down . These closures caused a ripple effect , as railroads , mines , and other factories across the region lost business and closed . The local economy suffered a depression , marked by high unemployment and underemployment , as laid @-@ off workers took lower @-@ paying , non @-@ union jobs . Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population , and like many other U.S. cities , it also saw white flight to the suburbs . 
 In 1984 the Homestead Works was demolished , replaced in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall . As a direct result of the loss of mill employment , the number of people living in Homestead dwindled . By the time of the 2000 census , the borough population was 3 @,@ 569 . The borough began financially recovering in 2002 , with the enlarging retail tax base . 
 = = = Corporations = = = 
 Top corporate headquarters such as Gulf Oil ( 1985 ) , Koppers ( 1987 ) , Westinghouse ( 1996 ) and Rockwell International ( 1989 ) were bought out by larger firms , with the loss of high paying , white collar headquarters and research personnel ( the " brain drain " ) as well as massive charitable contributions by the " home based " companies to local cultural and educational institutions . At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was No. 7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier . Over 1 @,@ 000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD research jobs were lost in one day . 
 Today , there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh , although manufacture continues at regional mills , such as the Edgar Thomson Works in nearby Braddock . 
 = = = Higher education = = = 
 Pittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under @-@ graduate and graduate school national rankings , The University of Pittsburgh , Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University . Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh had evolved in the mid @-@ 20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development . The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high @-@ technology fields . Other regional collegiate institutions include Robert Morris University , Chatham University , Carlow University , Point Park University , La Roche College , Pittsburgh Theological Seminary , and the Community College of Allegheny County . 
 Beginning in the 1980s , Pittsburgh 's economy shifted from heavy industry to services , medicine , higher education , tourism , banking , corporate headquarters , and high technology . Today , the top two private employers in the city are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center ( 26 @,@ 000 employees ) and the West Penn Allegheny Health System ( 13 @,@ 000 employees ) . 
 = = = Civic improvements = = = 
 Despite the economic turmoil , civic improvements continued . In the mid @-@ 1970s , Arthur P. Ziegler , Jr. and the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation ( Landmarks ) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies . Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad , a 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) long property at the base of Mt . Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh . In 1976 , Landmarks developed the site as a mixed @-@ use historic adaptive reuse development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice . Aided by an initial generous gift from the Allegheny Foundation in 1976 , Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel , a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet , and parking areas . Now shops , offices , restaurants , and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the Monongahela River , opposite the Golden Triangle ( Pittsburgh ) . Station Square is Pittsburgh 's premiere attraction generating over 3 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 visitors a year . It reflects a $ 100 million investment from all sources , with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s . In 1994 , Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to Forest City Enterprises which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs . Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10 @,@ 000 people – teachers , students , adults , and visitors – to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation . 
 During this period , Pittsburgh also became a national model for community development , through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson , who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968 , an organization that became the model for the nationwide <unk> America . Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh 's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop . 
 In 1985 , the J & L Steel site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built . The Pittsburgh Technology Center , home to many major technology companies , is planning major expansion in the area soon . In the 1980s , the " Renaissance II " urban revitalization created numerous new structures , such as PPG Place . In the 1990s , the former sites of the Homestead , Duquesne and South Side J & L mills were cleared . In 1992 , the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport opened . In 2001 , the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced by Heinz Field and PNC Park , despite being rejected by voter referendum . 
 Also in 1985 , Al Michaels revealed to a national TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city .

 = <unk> stingray = 
 The bluntnose stingray or Say 's stingray ( Dasyatis say , often misspelled sayi ) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae , native to the coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from the U.S. state of Massachusetts to Venezuela . It is a bottom @-@ dwelling species that prefers sandy or muddy habitats 1 – 10 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 32 @.@ 8 ft ) deep , and is migratory in the northern portion of its range . Typically growing to 78 cm ( 31 in ) across , the bluntnose stingray is characterized by a rhomboid pectoral fin disc with broadly rounded outer corners and an obtuse @-@ angled snout . It has a whip @-@ like tail with both an upper keel and a lower fin fold , and a line of small tubercles along the middle of its back . 
 More active at night than during the day when it is usually buried in sediment , the bluntnose stingray is a predator of small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes . This species is aplacental viviparous , in which the unborn young are nourished initially by yolk , and later histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) produced by their mother . Females give birth to 1 – 6 pups every May after a gestation period of 11 – 12 months , most of which consists of a period of arrested embryonic development . The venomous tail spine of the bluntnose stingray is potentially dangerous to unwary beachgoers . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed this species under Least Concern , as it is widely distributed , common , and minimally threatened by commercial fisheries . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur originally described the bluntnose stingray from specimens collected in Little Egg Harbor off the U.S. State of New Jersey . He published his account in an 1817 volume of the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia , and named the new species Raja say in honor of Thomas Say , one of the founding members of the Academy . The species was moved to the genus Dasyatis by subsequent authors . In 1841 , German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle erroneously gave the specific epithet as sayi in their Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen , which thereafter became the typical spelling used in literature . Recently , there has been a push to use the correct original spelling again , though it has also been proposed that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) officially emend the spelling to sayi , for consistency with previous usage . 
 Lisa Rosenberger 's 2001 phylogenetic analysis , based on morphological characters , found that the bluntnose stingray is one of the more basal members of its genus , and that it is a sister species to the diamond stingray ( D. dipterura ) of the western Pacific Ocean . The two species likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama , some three million years ago . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The bluntnose stingray is found in the western Atlantic Ocean , from Chesapeake Bay southward through the Florida Keys , the northern Gulf of Mexico , and the Greater and Lesser Antilles ; on rare occasions it is found as far north as New Jersey and Massachusetts , as far south as Venezuela , and as far west as Mexico . It is absent from the southern Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean coast of Central America . Reports of this species from off Brazil and Argentina likely represent misidentifications of the <unk> stingray ( D. <unk> ) . 
 Common in coastal habitats such as bays , lagoons , and estuaries , the bluntnose stingray is a bottom @-@ dwelling species usually found at a depth of 1 – 10 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 32 @.@ 8 ft ) , though it has been recorded from as deep as 20 m ( 66 ft ) . It frequents sandy or muddy flats , preferring water with a salinity of 25 – 43 ppt and a temperature of 12 – 33 ° C ( 54 – 91 ° F ) . Adult bluntnose stingrays are seldom found in seagrass meadows or shoals , though the latter serves as a habitat for young rays . Along the U.S. East Coast , schools of bluntnose stingrays migrate long distances northward into bays and estuaries to spend the summer , and move back to southern offshore waters for winter . 
 = = Description = = 
 The bluntnose stingray has a diamond @-@ shaped pectoral fin disc about a sixth wider than long , with broadly rounded outer corners . The leading margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at the tip of the snout at up to a 130 ° angle ; the anterior disc shape distinguishes this species from the similar Atlantic stingray ( D. sabina ) , which has a longer , more acute snout . The mouth is curved , with a central projection on the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw . There is a row of five papillae across the floor of the mouth , with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others . There are 36 – 50 upper tooth rows ; the teeth have quadrangular bases and are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces . The tooth crowns are rounded in females and juveniles , while those of males in breeding condition are triangular and pointed . The pelvic fins are triangular with rounded tips . 
 The whip @-@ like tail measures over one and a half times as long as the disc and bears one or two long , serrated stinging spines on top , about a quarter of the tail length back from the base . The second spine , if present , is a replacement that periodically grows in front of the existing spine . Behind the spine , there are well @-@ developed upper and lower fin folds , with the lower fold longer and wider than the upper . Small thorns or tubercles are found in a midline row from behind the eyes to the base of the tail spine , increasing in number with age . Adults also have prickles before and behind the eyes and on the outer parts of the disc . The dorsal coloration is grayish , reddish , or greenish brown ; some individuals also possess bluish spots , are darker towards the sides and rear , or have a thin white disc margin . The ventral surface is whitish , sometimes with a dark disc margin or dark blotches . A record off French Guyana gives the maximum disc width of this species as 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) , but that specimen may have been misidentified and other sources give a maximum disc width of no more than 0 @.@ 78 m ( 2 @.@ 6 ft ) . Females grow larger than males . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The bluntnose stingray has generally nocturnal habits and spends much of the day buried in the substrate . It has been known to follow the rising tide to forage in water barely deep enough to cover its body . This species preys upon small invertebrates , including crustaceans , annelid worms , and bivalve and gastropod molluscs , and bony fishes . It mainly targets benthic and burrowing organisms , but also opportunistically takes free @-@ swimming prey . In Delaware Bay , this species feeds predominantly on the shrimp <unk> <unk> and the blood worm <unk> <unk> , and its overall dietary composition is virtually identical to that of the roughtail stingray ( D. centroura ) , with which it shares the bay . The bluntnose stingray is preyed upon by larger fishes such as the bull shark ( Carcharhinus leucas ) . Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the monogenean <unk> corona , and the trematodes Monocotyle pricei and <unk> cristata . 
 Like other stingrays , the bluntnose stingray is aplacental <unk> with the embryos initially sustained by yolk . Later in development , finger @-@ like extensions of the uterine epithelium called " trophonemata " surround the embryo and deliver protein and lipid @-@ rich histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) produced by the mother . Only the left ovary and uterus in adult females are functional . Mating occurs during a well @-@ defined period from April to June , peaking in May , with the males presumably using their pointed teeth to grasp the females for copulation . However , embryonic development halts at the <unk> stage , shortly after the formation of the zygote , and does not resume for approximately ten months . In the spring of the following year , the embryos rapidly mature over a period of 10 – 12 weeks . This period of embryonic diapause may reflect the greater availability of food in the spring . 
 Including the extended period of diapause , the gestation period lasts around 11 – 12 months , with 1 – 6 young being born in mid to late May . In 1941 , in a shallow channel between Chincoteague Island and Cape Charles , Virginia , several large bluntnose stingrays were observed repeatedly breaking the surface and swimming rapidly in straight lines , some with their tails thrashing in the air ; others were seen rising slowly to the surface and " hanging " for several minutes . One of the rays was hooked and the shock of capture caused it to release five near @-@ term fetuses , suggesting that this activity may have been related to parturition . The aborted young were pale with small yolk sacs , and a swelling in the place of their tail spines . Females begin ovulating a new batch of eggs immediately after giving birth , indicating that they have an annual reproductive cycle . Newborn rays measure 15 – 17 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 – 6 @.@ 7 in ) across and weigh 170 – 250 g ( 6 @.@ 0 – 8 @.@ 8 oz ) . Males mature sexually at disc width of 30 – 36 cm ( 12 – 14 in ) and a weight of 3 – 6 kg ( 6 @.@ 6 – 13 @.@ 2 lb ) , while females mature at a disc width of 50 – 54 cm ( 20 – 21 in ) and a weight of 7 – 15 kg ( 15 – 33 lb ) . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The bluntnose stingray is not aggressive , though it will defend itself if stepped on or otherwise incited . Its tail spine can inflict an excruciating injury , and can easily pierce leather or rubber footwear . The paralytic venom delivered may have potentially life @-@ threatening effects on those with heart or respiratory problems , and is the subject of biomedical and neurobiological research . This species is popular with ecotourist divers . Abundant and widespread , the bluntnose stingray is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries operating in nearshore U.S. waters ; these activities are not a threat to its population , as most captured rays are released alive . The impact of fishing in the southern parts of its range is uncertain , but is unlikely to significantly affect the species as a whole as these activities occur outside its centers of distribution . As a result , the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the bluntnose stingray as of Least Concern . 
 = Siege of Trsat = 
 The Siege of Trsat ( Croatian : Opsada <unk> ) was a battle fought over possession of the town of Trsat ( Latin : Tarsatica ) in Liburnia , near the Croatian – Frankish border . The battle was fought in the autumn of 799 between the defending forces of the Dalmatian Croatia under the leadership of Croatian duke Višeslav and the invading Frankish army of the Carolingian Empire led by Eric of Friuli . The battle was a Croatian victory , and the Frankish commander Eric was killed during the siege . 
 The Frankish invasion of Croatia , the destruction of Tarsatica , the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor , and negotiations from 802 – 815 between the Franks and Byzantines led to a stalemate . The Dalmatian Croatia consequently peacefully accepted a limited Frankish overlordship . 
 = = Background = = 
 Charlemagne , King of the Franks from 768 until his death in 814 , expanded the Frankish kingdom into an empire that incorporated much of western and central Europe . He brought the Frankish state face to face with the Slavs to the northeast and the Avars and Slavs to the southeast of the Frankish empire . The Croats lived in Pannonian Croatia and Dalmatian Croatia ( Littoral Croatia ) to the southeast of the Frankish Empire . Dalmatian Croatia was ruled by Duke Višeslav , one of the first known Croatian dukes . 
 While fighting the Avars , the Franks called for Slavic @-@ Croatian support . Croatian Prince Vojnomir of Pannonian Croatia launched a joint counterattack with the help of Frankish troops under Charlemagne in 791 . The offensive was successful and the Avars were driven out of Croatia . In return for the help of Charlemagne , Vojnomir was obliged to recognize Frankish sovereignty , convert to Christianity , and have his territory named Pannonian Croatia . Charlemagne again campaigned against the Avars and won a major victory in 796 . Prince Vojnomir aided him , and the Franks became overlords of the Croatians of northern Dalmatia , Slavonia , and Pannonia . The Franks placed Pannonian Croats under Eric , the margrave of Friuli , who then tried to extend his rule over the Croatians of Dalmatia . 
 The conquest of Istria by the Franks brought the realm of Charlemagne adjacent to Dalmatia . Dalmatia at that time included both Roman cities and a Slavic @-@ Croatian hinterland that was loosely subject to the rule of the Byzantine Empire . In the treaty of 798 , the Franks acknowledged Byzantine rights over the Slavs , but in the following years both Croatian <unk> ( dukes ) and Roman communities recognized an opportunity to win full independence from both Imperial powers . 
 As the eldest son of Gerold of <unk> and as a high ranking Frankish commander , Eric was titled from 789 to his death the Duke of Friuli ( dux <unk> ) . He was appointed governor of Istria , <unk> , and neighbouring areas by Charlemagne . Eric wanted to extend his dominion by conquering Dalmatian Croatia . In the autumn of 799 , Eric marched from Istria along the seacoast of Liburnia towards the town of Trsat , which is today part of the city of Rijeka . Meanwhile his opponent , duke Višeslav , gathered his forces and moved north from his governing center at Nin . 
 = = Siege = = 
 Upon arriving at the foot of the settlement , Eric besieged and attacked the city , but was repelled . Led by duke Višeslav , the inhabitants of Trsat threw spears , shot arrows , and hurled huge stones on the enemy , and managed to kill many of them . Eric 's forces fled their positions , and were subsequently routed by the forces of Višeslav in an ambush . Eric was among those killed , and his death and defeat proved to be a great blow for the Carolingian Empire . <unk> Patriarch Saint Paulinus II cursed the land in which the hero was killed , and wrote Carmen de <unk> fidei , the <unk> or elegy for his death . 
 According to contemporary Frankish scholar and courtier Einhard , Eric was killed at Trsat ( <unk> ) , a town on the coast of Liburnia by the treachery of the inhabitants . Due to a lack of primary materials , it is uncertain who killed Duke Eric . Most of historians point at Croats , while some point at Byzantines . Einhard also notes the death of Gerold , Prefect of Bavaria , another Frankish commander who was slain in Pannonia in the same year . Croatian historian Nenad <unk> refers to this event as a successful assassination attempt by Avars and Slavs . Historian Pierre <unk> believes that Dalmatian Croats ( <unk> ) killed Eric in collusion with Avars . 
 Besides the Royal Frankish Annals ( Annales Regni Francorum ) , there is another primary source compiled in c . 950 , the historical work De administrando imperio , ascribed to Constantine Porphyrogenitus , which refers to Croatian @-@ Frankish relations . Constantine notes that for a number of years the Croats of Dalmatia were subjects of the Franks , who treated them brutally . The Croats revolted and slew their princes . In an act of revenge , a large army from Francia invaded Croatia . After seven years of war , the Croats managed to defeat the Franks , killing a large portion of the invading army along with its commander . Although Constantine describes a chain of events that are analogous to the ' Siege of Trsat ' , he does not mention Tarsatica or the exact year of these events .

 In 800 , Eric 's successor <unk> of Friuli invaded the Dalmatian Croatia by the order of Charlemagne , but without considerable military success . Still , Tarsatica was burned down . Tarsatica 's surviving inhabitants moved to a more protected hill , where they established a new settlement called Trsat . Višeslav continued to rule over the Dalmatian Croatia and warred against the Franks , avoiding defeat upon his death in 802 . He was succeeded by his son Borna , who later become a Frankish ally . 
 On Christmas Day in 800 , Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Imperator Romanorum ( Holy Roman Emperor ) in Saint Peter 's Basilica . This was a direct challenge to Byzantium 's claim to be the one - the Roman - empire . Nicephorus I of the Byzantine Empire and Charlemagne of the Holy Roman Empire settled their imperial boundaries in 803 . Dalmatian Croatia peacefully accepted a limited Frankish overlordship . The peace of <unk> in 812 confirmed Dalmatia , except for the Byzantine cities and islands , as under Frankish domain . 
 Ljudevit Posavski , Croatian Duke of Pannonian Croatia , led a resistance to Frankish domination . Ljudevit also had to fight against Dalmatian Croatia , as their prince Borna was a Frankish ally . After unsuccessful resistance by Ljudevit and Pannonian Croats , the Franks again controlled Istria , Dalmatia , and Pannonia . Nevertheless , Dalmatian Croatia remained a semi @-@ independent duchy between the two Empires , as they had a right to elect their own prince . 
 = Yugoslav destroyer Split = 
 The Yugoslav destroyer Split was a large destroyer designed for the Royal Yugoslav Navy in the late 1930s . Construction began in 1939 , but she was captured incomplete by the Italians during the Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 . They continued to build the ship , barring a brief hiatus , but she was not completed before she was scuttled after the Italian surrender in September 1943 . The Germans occupied Split and refloated the destroyer later that year , but made no efforts to continue work . The ship was scuttled again before the city was taken over by the Yugoslav Partisans in late 1944 . Split was refloated once more , but the new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was able to do little with her before the Tito – Stalin Split in 1948 halted most work . Aid and equipment from the United States and Great Britain finally allowed her to be completed 20 years after construction began . She was commissioned in July 1958 and served as the navy 's flagship for most of her career . Split became a training ship in the late 1970s after a boiler explosion ; she was decommissioned in 1980 , and scrapped six years later .
