 SS Ohioan was a cargo ship built in 1914 for the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company . During World War I , she was taken over by the United States Navy and commissioned as USS Ohioan ( ID @-@ <unk> ) . 
 Ohioan was built by the Maryland Steel Company as one of eight sister ships ordered by the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company for inter @-@ coastal service cargo via the Panama Canal . When the canal was temporarily closed by landslides in late 1915 , Ohioan sailed via the Straits of Magellan until the canal reopened in mid 1916 . During World War I , USS Ohioan carried cargo , animals , and a limited number of passengers to France , and returned over 8 @,@ 000 American troops after the Armistice , including the highly decorated American soldier Alvin York . After Ohioan 's naval service ended in 1919 , she was returned to her original owners . 
 Ohioan 's post @-@ war career was relatively uneventful until 8 October 1936 , when she ran aground near Seal Rock at the Golden Gate , the entrance to San Francisco Bay . Attempts to free the ship were unsuccessful and , because of the close proximity of the wreck to San Francisco , the grounded Ohioan drew large crowds to watch salvage operations . Angelo J. Rossi , the mayor of San Francisco , toured the wreck on 19 October . Ohioan 's hulk caught fire in March 1937 , and the wreck broke into two pieces in a storm in December . As late as 1939 , some of Ohioan 's rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 In May 1912 , the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point , Maryland , for two new cargo ships — Iowan and Ohioan . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8 % profit for Maryland Steel , but with a maximum price of $ 640 @,@ 000 per ship . Maryland Steel financed the construction with a credit plan which called for a 5 % down payment in cash followed by nine monthly installments for the balance . The deal allowed for some of the nine installments to be converted into longer @-@ term notes or mortgages . The final cost of Ohioan , including financing costs , was $ 73 @.@ 58 per deadweight ton , which came out to just under $ 730 @,@ 000 . 
 Ohioan ( Maryland Steel yard no . 133 ) was the second ship built under the contract . She was launched on 24 January 1914 , and delivered to American @-@ Hawaiian on 30 June . The ship was 6 @,@ 649 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 407 feet 7 inches ( 124 @.@ 23 m ) in length ( between perpendiculars ) and 53 feet 8 inches ( 16 @.@ 36 m ) abeam . She had a deadweight tonnage of 9 @,@ 920 LT DWT , and her cargo holds , which had a storage capacity of 438 @,@ 154 cubic feet ( 12 @,@ 407 @.@ 1 m3 ) , were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so that she could carry perishable products from the West Coast — such as fresh produce from Southern California farms — to the East Coast . Ohioan had a single steam engine powered by oil @-@ fired boilers that drove a single screw propeller at a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) . 
 = = Early career = = 
 When Ohioan began sailing for American @-@ Hawaiian , the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Straits of Magellan to West Coast ports and Hawaii , and vice versa . Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii , but westbound cargoes were more general in nature . Following the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914 , American @-@ Hawaiian ships switched to take that route . 
 As World War I continued in Europe and increased the demand for defense @-@ related shipping , American @-@ Hawaiian stopped its sugar service . Ohioan 's specific activities during this time are not known . She may have been in the half of the American @-@ Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service , or she may have been in the group of American @-@ Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America , delivering coal , gasoline , and steel in exchange for coffee , nitrates , cocoa , rubber , and manganese ore . 
 = = World War I = = 
 Unlike her surviving sister ships , there is no evidence that Ohioan was ever chartered by the United States Army ; Ohioan 's activities between the United States ' declaration of war on Germany in April 1917 , and her acquisition by the United States Navy on 5 August 1918 , are unknown . She was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) two days later , under a loan charter . After a refit and taking on a load of cargo , Ohioan sailed for Saint @-@ Nazaire , France , where she arrived on 29 August . Dividing the next month between that port and Brest , Ohioan sailed for New York on 1 October . Fitted there with horse stalls , she loaded 60 officers and men , and equestrian and general cargo , before sailing on 1 November for La Pallice . 
 With the signing of the Armistice on 11 November the fighting came to an end , and the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately . Upon her return to the United States on 5 December , Ohioan was selected to become a troop transport and transferred from the NOTS to the Cruiser and Transport Force . Before she could begin returning troops , Ohioan had to be converted from a cargo and animal ship . Although sources do not indicate the specific modifications Ohioan underwent , typical conversions for other ships included the installation of berths , and adding greatly expanded cooking and toilet facilities to handle the large numbers of men aboard . Similar modifications on Ohioan 's sister ship Minnesotan took three months , but it is not known how long Ohioan 's refit took . 
 In March , Ohioan returned 1 @,@ 627 men to New York , mostly from the 348th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 87th Infantry Division , followed by another 1 @,@ 596 officers and men , and 1 @,@ 000 homing pigeons on 16 April . Among the pigeons was Cher Ami — the only bird sent out by the Lost Battalion that was able to get a message through — and 100 captured German pigeons . Cher Ami had received the French Croix de Guerre with Palm and had been recommended for the U.S. Army Distinguished Service Cross by General John J. Pershing . 
 Ohioan docked at New York on 22 May on her next voyage with a portion of the 328th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 82nd Infantry Division . One of the members of the unit was Sergeant Alvin C. York , who had led an attack on a German machine gun nest during the Meuse @-@ Argonne Offensive and captured 132 German officers and men . York had been honored with the U.S. Medal of Honor and the French Croix de Guerre with Palm ( among other awards ) , both of which he wore on his coat on arrival at New York . After Ohioan docked , York held a well @-@ attended press conference on board . 
 On 20 June , Ohioan returned another load of troops that included Base Hospital 98 , and the 20th Engineers . By the time Ohioan had completed her sixth and final trooping voyage on 16 September 1919 , Ohioan had carried home 8 @,@ 383 healthy and wounded men . USS Ohioan was decommissioned on 6 October 1919 , and returned to American @-@ Hawaiian . 
 = = Later career = = 
 Ohioan resumed cargo service with American @-@ Hawaiian after her return from World War I service . Although the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by that time , Ohioan continued inter @-@ coastal service through the Panama Canal relatively uneventfully for the next 17 years . On 23 November 1933 , Ohioan collided with Liberty in the Ambrose Channel . She was consequently beached near the West Bank Light . Ohioan was refloated on 26 November . 
 In early morning hours of 8 October 1936 , however , Ohioan ran aground near Seal Rock on the south shore of the Golden Gate , just outside San Francisco Bay . The ship , sailing in a dense fog , strayed too close to shore and grounded on the rocks , sending a shower of sparks that lit up the night . When the fog cleared later in the morning , the ship was firmly seated on the rocks at the base of a 250 @-@ foot ( 76 m ) cliff , and some 300 feet ( 91 m ) from the mainland . Coast Guardsmen on shore attached three lines to the ship and set up a breeches buoy to take off the harbor pilot , but the crew stayed on board the ship in hopes that the high tide would free her from the rocky perch . As word of the shipwreck spread , spectators clambered over the cliff to get a view of the scene ; one man died from a heart attack and two women broke ankles in separate falls . Newsboys soon arrived on the scene , selling newspapers telling of Ohioan 's woe within sight of the stranded ship . Policemen were called out to keep order as the crowd grew into the thousands . 
 The next day , as the seas battered the ship and drove her farther on the rocks , two Coast Guard boats took 31 men from the ship . American @-@ Hawaiian announced that a Los Angeles salvage firm had been hired to retrieve the 1 @,@ 500 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 1 @,@ 520 t ) cargo , which included explosives and oil . Two heavy @-@ duty electric pumps were lowered to the ship via the breeches buoy , and plans were drawn up for connecting them to the San Francisco municipal electric system in order to pump out the ship . 
 The crowds of onlookers continued to watch as salvage efforts progressed ; a 75 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Oakland fell down the embankment while watching the action on 13 October . The mayor of San Francisco , Angelo J. Rossi , rode the breeches buoy to the ship and toured it for 45 minutes on 19 October . On 22 October , the Los Angeles Times ran an Associated Press story saying that marine experts were considering the use of a method first patented by Abraham Lincoln in May 1849 in order to re @-@ float the stranded ship . All efforts , however , were unsuccessful , and by 31 October , American @-@ Hawaiian placed an advertisement in the Los Angeles Times requesting bids for the purchase of the ship and her cargo " as and where she now lies ... on the rocks near Point Lobos , San Francisco " . E. J. Mitchell was the winning bidder , securing rights to the ship and its cargo for $ 2 @,@ 800 . 
 In March 1937 , five months after the wreck , the hulk of Ohioan — still aground near Seal Rock — caught fire when a watchman aboard the ship attempted to burn some meat in a refrigerator . The flames died out before reaching the explosives that remained aboard the wreck . A Pacific storm in December the same year caused the hulk of Ohioan to break in two . By 1939 , only remnants of some of Ohioan 's rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks . 
 Author Mark Ellis Thomas suggests that English poet and novelist Malcolm Lowry may have been inspired by the wreck of Ohioan in his poem " In Tempest 's Tavern " . One excerpt from the poem refers to " The Ohio [ sic ] smoking in Frisco on a sharp pen / Of rock " . At the time of Ohioan 's grounding , Lowry was in San Diego , preparing to sail to Acapulco . 
 = Continuous distillation = 
 Continuous distillation , a form of distillation , is an ongoing separation in which a mixture is continuously ( without interruption ) fed into the process and separated fractions are removed continuously as output streams . Distillation is the separation or partial separation of a liquid feed mixture into components or fractions by selective boiling ( or evaporation ) and condensation . The process produces at least two output fractions . These fractions include at least one volatile distillate fraction , which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor condensed to a liquid , and practically always a bottoms ( or residuum ) fraction , which is the least volatile residue that has not been separately captured as a condensed vapor . 
 An alternative to continuous distillation is batch distillation , where the mixture is added to the unit at the start of the distillation , distillate fractions are taken out sequentially in time ( one after another ) during the distillation , and the remaining bottoms fraction is removed at the end . Because each of the distillate fractions are taken out at different times , only one distillate exit point ( location ) is needed for a batch distillation and the distillate can just be switched to a different receiver , a fraction @-@ collecting container . Batch distillation is often used when smaller quantities are distilled . In a continuous distillation , each of the fraction streams is taken simultaneously throughout operation ; therefore , a separate exit point is needed for each fraction . In practice when there are multiple distillate fractions , the distillate exit points are located at different heights on a fractionating column . The bottoms fraction can be taken from the bottom of the distillation column or unit , but is often taken from a reboiler connected to the bottom of the column . 
 Each fraction may contain one or more components ( types of chemical compounds ) . When distilling crude oil or a similar feedstock , each fraction contains many components of similar volatility and other properties . Although it is possible to run a small @-@ scale or laboratory continuous distillation , most often continuous distillation is used in a large @-@ scale industrial process . 
 = = Industrial application = = 
 Distillation is one of the unit operations of chemical engineering . Continuous distillation is used widely in the chemical process industries where large quantities of liquids have to be distilled . Such industries are the natural gas processing , petrochemical production , coal tar processing , liquor production , liquified air separation , hydrocarbon solvents production and similar industries , but it finds its widest application in petroleum refineries . In such refineries , the crude oil feedstock is a very complex multicomponent mixture that must be separated and yields of pure chemical compounds are not expected , only groups of compounds within a relatively small range of boiling points , which are called fractions . These fractions are the origin of the term fractional distillation or fractionation . It is often not worthwhile separating the components in these fractions any further based on product requirements and economics . 
 Industrial distillation is typically performed in large , vertical cylindrical columns ( as shown in images 1 and 2 ) known as " distillation towers " or " distillation columns " with diameters ranging from about 65 centimeters to 11 meters and heights ranging from about 6 meters to 60 meters or more . 
 = = Principle = = 
 The principle for continuous distillation is the same as for normal distillation : when a liquid mixture is heated so that it boils , the composition of the vapor above the liquid differs from the liquid composition . If this vapor is then separated and condensed into a liquid , it becomes richer in the lower boiling point component ( s ) of the original mixture . 
 This is what happens in a continuous distillation column . A mixture is heated up , and routed into the distillation column . On entering the column , the feed starts flowing down but part of it , the component ( s ) with lower boiling point ( s ) , vaporizes and rises . However , as it rises , it cools and while part of it continues up as vapor , some of it ( enriched in the less volatile component ) begins to descend again . 
 Image 3 depicts a simple continuous fractional distillation tower for separating a feed stream into two fractions , an overhead distillate product and a bottoms product . The " lightest " products ( those with the lowest boiling point or highest volatility ) exit from the top of the columns and the " heaviest " products ( the bottoms , those with the highest boiling point ) exit from the bottom of the column . The overhead stream may be cooled and condensed using a water @-@ cooled or air @-@ cooled condenser . The bottoms reboiler may be a steam @-@ heated or hot oil @-@ heated heat exchanger , or even a gas or oil @-@ fired furnace . 
 In a continuous distillation , the system is kept in a steady state or approximate steady state . Steady state means that quantities related to the process do not change as time passes during operation . Such constant quantities include feed input rate , output stream rates , heating and cooling rates , reflux ratio , and temperatures , pressures , and compositions at every point ( location ) . Unless the process is disturbed due to changes in feed , heating , ambient temperature , or condensing , steady state is normally maintained . This is also the main attraction of continuous distillation , apart from the minimum amount of ( easily <unk> ) surveillance ; if the feed rate and feed composition are kept constant , product rate and quality are also constant . Even when a variation in conditions occurs , modern process control methods are commonly able to gradually return the continuous process to another steady state again . 
 Since a continuous distillation unit is fed constantly with a feed mixture and not filled all at once like a batch distillation , a continuous distillation unit does not need a sizable distillation pot , vessel , or reservoir for a batch fill . Instead , the mixture can be fed directly into the column , where the actual separation occurs . The height of the feed point along the column can vary on the situation and is designed so as to provide optimal results . See McCabe – Thiele method . 
 A continuous distillation is often a fractional distillation and can be a vacuum distillation or a steam distillation . 
 = = Design and operation = = 
 Design and operation of a distillation column depends on the feed and desired products . Given a simple , binary component feed , analytical methods such as the McCabe – Thiele method or the <unk> equation can be used to assist in the design . For a multi @-@ component feed , computerized simulation models are used both for design and subsequently in operation of the column as well . Modeling is also used to optimize already erected columns for the distillation of mixtures other than those the distillation equipment was originally designed for . 
 When a continuous distillation column is in operation , it has to be closely monitored for changes in feed composition , operating temperature and product composition . Many of these tasks are performed using advanced computer control equipment . 
 = = = Column feed = = = 
 The column can be fed in different ways . If the feed is from a source at a pressure higher than the distillation column pressure , it is simply piped into the column . Otherwise , the feed is pumped or compressed into the column . The feed may be a superheated vapor , a saturated vapor , a partially vaporized liquid @-@ vapor mixture , a saturated liquid ( i.e. , liquid at its boiling point at the column 's pressure ) , or a sub @-@ cooled liquid . If the feed is a liquid at a much higher pressure than the column pressure and flows through a pressure let @-@ down valve just ahead of the column , it will immediately expand and undergo a partial flash vaporization resulting in a liquid @-@ vapor mixture as it enters the distillation column . 
 = = = Improving separation = = = 
 Although small size units , mostly made of glass , can be used in laboratories , industrial units are large , vertical , steel vessels ( see images 1 and 2 ) known as " distillation towers " or " distillation columns " . To improve the separation , the tower is normally provided inside with horizontal plates or trays as shown in image 5 , or the column is packed with a packing material . To provide the heat required for the vaporization involved in distillation and also to compensate for heat loss , heat is most often added to the bottom of the column by a reboiler , and the purity of the top product can be improved by recycling some of the externally condensed top product liquid as reflux . Depending on their purpose , distillation columns may have liquid outlets at intervals up the length of the column as shown in image 4 . 
 = = = = Reflux = = = = 
 Large @-@ scale industrial fractionation towers use reflux to achieve more efficient separation of products . Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation tower that is returned to the upper part of the tower as shown in images 3 and 4 . Inside the tower , the <unk> reflux liquid provides cooling and partial condensation of the <unk> vapors , thereby increasing the efficacy of the distillation tower . The more reflux that is provided , the better is the tower 's separation of the lower boiling from the higher boiling components of the feed . A balance of heating with a reboiler at the bottom of a column and cooling by condensed reflux at the top of the column maintains a temperature gradient ( or gradual temperature difference ) along the height of the column to provide good conditions for fractionating the feed mixture . Reflux flows at the middle of the tower are called <unk> . 
 Changing the reflux ( in combination with changes in feed and product withdrawal ) can also be used to improve the separation properties of a continuous distillation column while in operation ( in contrast to adding plates or trays , or changing the packing , which would , at a minimum , require quite significant downtime ) . 
 = = = = Plates or trays = = = = 
 Distillation towers ( such as in images 3 and 4 ) use various vapor and liquid contacting methods to provide the required number of equilibrium stages . Such devices are commonly known as " plates " or " trays " . Each of these plates or trays is at a different temperature and pressure . The stage at the tower bottom has the highest pressure and temperature . Progressing upwards in the tower , the pressure and temperature decreases for each succeeding stage . The vapor – liquid equilibrium for each feed component in the tower reacts in its unique way to the different pressure and temperature conditions at each of the stages . That means that each component establishes a different concentration in the vapor and liquid phases at each of the stages , and this results in the separation of the components . Some example trays are depicted in image 5 . A more detailed , expanded image of two trays can be seen in the theoretical plate article . The reboiler often acts as an additional equilibrium stage . 
 If each physical tray or plate were 100 % efficient , then the number of physical trays needed for a given separation would equal the number of equilibrium stages or theoretical plates . However , that is very seldom the case . Hence , a distillation column needs more plates than the required number of theoretical vapor – liquid equilibrium stages . 
 = = = = Packing = = = = 
 Another way of improving the separation in a distillation column is to use a packing material instead of trays . These offer the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column ( when compared to plates or trays ) , beneficial when operating under vacuum . If a distillation tower uses packing instead of trays , the number of necessary theoretical equilibrium stages is first determined and then the packing height equivalent to a theoretical equilibrium stage , known as the height equivalent to a theoretical plate ( HETP ) , is also determined . The total packing height required is the number theoretical stages multiplied by the HETP . 
 This packing material can either be random dumped packing such as <unk> rings or structured sheet metal . Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface , where mass transfer takes place . Unlike conventional tray distillation in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor – liquid equilibrium , the vapor – liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous . However , when modeling packed columns it is useful to compute a number of theoretical plates to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column with respect to more traditional trays . <unk> shaped <unk> have different surface areas and void space between <unk> . Both of these factors affect packing performance . 
 Another factor in addition to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is liquid and vapor distribution entering the packed bed . The number of theoretical stages required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio . If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters the packed bed , the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in the packed bed and the required separation will not be achieved . The packing will appear to not be working properly . The height equivalent to a theoretical plate ( HETP ) will be greater than expected . The problem is not the packing itself but the mal @-@ distribution of the fluids entering the packed bed . Liquid mal @-@ distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor . The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform at maximum efficiency . Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor can be found in references . 
 = = = Overhead system arrangements = = = 
 Images 4 and 5 assume an overhead stream that is totally condensed into a liquid product using water or air @-@ cooling . However , in many cases , the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream . In yet other cases , the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower ( which is the case in the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries ) . In those cases , if the distillate product is insoluble in water , the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase , a condensed water phase and a non @-@ <unk> gas phase , which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream . 
 = = Examples = = 
 = = = Continuous distillation of crude oil = = = 
 Petroleum crude oils contain hundreds of different hydrocarbon compounds : paraffins , <unk> and aromatics as well as organic sulfur compounds , organic nitrogen compounds and some oxygen containing hydrocarbons such as phenols . Although crude oils generally do not contain olefins , they are formed in many of the processes used in a petroleum refinery . 
 The crude oil <unk> does not produce products having a single boiling point ; rather , it produces fractions having boiling ranges . For example , the crude oil <unk> produces an overhead fraction called " naphtha " which becomes a gasoline component after it is further processed through a catalytic <unk> to remove sulfur and a catalytic reformer to reform its hydrocarbon molecules into more complex molecules with a higher octane rating value . 
 The naphtha cut , as that fraction is called , contains many different hydrocarbon compounds . Therefore , it has an initial boiling point of about 35 ° C and a final boiling point of about 200 ° C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different boiling range . At some distance below the overhead , the next cut is withdrawn from the side of the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut , also known as a kerosene cut . The boiling range of that cut is from an initial boiling point of about 150 ° C to a final boiling point of about 270 ° C , and it also contains many different hydrocarbons . The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling range from about 180 ° C to about 315 ° C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp . After these come the heavy fuel oil cuts and finally the bottoms product , with very wide boiling ranges . All these cuts are processed further in subsequent refining processes . 
 = Peter I Island = 
 Peter I Island ( Norwegian : Peter I <unk> ) is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea , 450 kilometres ( 280 mi ) from Antarctica . It is claimed as a dependency of Norway , and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic . Peter I Island is 11 by 19 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 8 by 11 @.@ 8 mi ) long and 156 square kilometres ( 60 sq mi ) , slightly larger than Staten Island . The tallest peak is the ultra and 1 @,@ 640 @-@ meter ( 5 @,@ 380 ft ) tall Lars Christensen Peak . Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice , making it inaccessible almost all year round . There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals . 
 The island was first sighted by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen on 21 January 1821 and was named for Peter I of Russia . Not until 2 February 1929 did anyone set foot on the island , when Nils Larsen and Ola <unk> 's Second Norvegia Expedition , financed by Lars Christensen , was successful . They claimed it for Norway , who annexed it in 1931 and made it a dependency in 1933 . The next landing occurred in 1948 and the island has been subject to some scientific research and a limited amount of tourism . The island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty in 1961 . Since 1987 , there has been an automated meteorological station on the island . Three amateur radio DX @-@ <unk> have visited the island and there are sporadic landings by tourists .

 The first sighting of Peter I Island was made on 21 January 1821 by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen 's expedition , who commanded the ships Vostok and <unk> under the Russian flag . He named the island for Tsar Peter I the Great of Russia . Drift ice made it impossible for <unk> to come nearer than 25 kilometers ( 16 mi ) from the island . It was the first land to have been spotted south of the Antarctic Circle , and was thus also the southernmost sighted land at the time of its discovery . In January 1910 , the French expedition led by Jean @-@ Martin Charcot and his ship Pourquoi @-@ Pas confirmed Bellingshausen 's discovery , but they also did not land , being stopped 5 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) from the island by pack ice . 
 In 1926 and 1927 , Norwegian <unk> <unk> circumnavigated and surveyed the island from Odd I. However , he was also prevented from landing . The Norwegian whale @-@ ship owner Lars Christensen financed several expeditions to the Antarctic , in part for research and in part to claim land for Norway . The latter was motivated by the British taxation of whaling stations in the Antarctic , and Christensen hoped to be able to establish stations on Norwegian territory to gain better privileges and so at least the taxes went to his home country . The first expedition to land on the island was the Christensen @-@ financed second Norvegia expedition , led by Nils Larsen and Ola <unk> . They landed on 2 February 1929 and claimed the island for Norway . Larsen attempted to land again in 1931 , but was hindered by pack ice . On 6 March 1931 , a Norwegian royal proclamation declared the island under Norwegian sovereignty and on 23 March 1933 the island was declared a dependency . 
 The next landing occurred on 10 February 1948 by Larsen 's ship <unk> . Biological , geological and hydrographic surveys underwent for three days , before the pack ice forced the expedition to leave . The expedition built a hut and placed a copy of the document of occupation from 1929 inside . On 23 June 1961 , Peter I Island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty , after Norway 's signing of the treaty in 1959 . Since then , there have been several landings on the island by various nations for scientific investigations , as well as a limited number of ships that have successfully landed tourists on the island . 
 In 1987 , the Norwegian Polar Institute sent five scientists to spend eleven days on the island . The main focuses were aerial photography and topographical measurements to allow an accurate map of the island to be produced . The second important area was marine biological investigations , although also geological , biological and other surveys were conducted . The team also built an automatic weather station . Three DX @-@ <unk> have been sent to the island , in 1987 , 1994 and 2006 .

 Peter I Island is a volcanic island located 450 kilometres ( 280 mi ) off the coast of Ellsworth Land of continental Antarctica . It has an area of 154 square kilometres ( 59 sq mi ) . The island is almost entirely covered by glacier , with about 95 % of the surface covered by ice . 
 Surrounding the island is a 40 @-@ meter ( 130 ft ) tall ice front and vertical cliffs . The long stretches of ice caps are supplemented with rock outcrops . Landing is only possible at three points , and only during the short period of the year in which the island is not surrounded by pack ice . These landings take place on the west side at Kapp Ingrid Christensen , a peninsula which divides the bays <unk> and <unk> . On the cape are some narrow strips of beach , which are suitable for landing . The beach in <unk> is just 4 meters ( 13 ft ) wide and is entered via the natural arch <unk> . On the west side is a plateau , while the north and south coasts feature ice shelves . The eastern side is the steepest and features two rock columns with flat tops in the sea . 
 The island is a shield volcano , although it is not known if it is still active , and it has been categorized as either Holocene or historic , based on date samples ranging from 0 @.@ 1 to 0 @.@ 35 million years ago . The summit , Lars Christensen Peak , is a 100 @-@ metre ( 330 ft ) wide circular crater . An ultra prominent peak at 1 @,@ 640 metres ( 5 @,@ 380 ft ) elevation , it is named for Lars Christensen . It is not known whether this volcano is extinct or not , because the upper part is apparently unmodified by glaciation — indicating an eruption several centuries ago .

 The island 's vegetation consists exclusively of mosses and lichens which have adapted to the extreme Antarctic climate . The island has a very harsh climate with strong winds and freezing temperatures . The steady snowfall keeps vegetation to a minimum . The island is a breeding ground for a few seabirds , particularly southern fulmars , but also Wilson 's storm petrels and Antarctic terns . Penguins , including Adélie and chinstrap penguins , visit the island infrequently . There are numerous seals , particularly crabeater seals , leopard seals and smaller numbers of southern elephant seals .

 Peter I Island is one of Norway 's two territorial claims in Antarctica , the other being Queen Maud Land . Peter I Island is the only claim within 90 ° W and 150 ° W and is also the only claim which is not a sector . Being south of 60 ° S , the island is subject to the Antarctic Treaty . The treaty ensures free access to the island for any scientific investigation , and states that it can only be used for peaceful purposes . Norway , Australia , France , New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognized each other 's claims in Antarctica . 
 Norwegian administration of the island is handled by the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security , located in Oslo . The annexation of the island is regulated by the Dependency Act of 24 March 1933 . It establishes that Norwegian criminal law , private law and procedural law applies to the island , in addition to other laws that explicitly state they are valid on the island . It further establishes that all land belongs to the state , and prohibits the storage and detonation of nuclear products .

 = Great Northern Highway = 
 Great Northern Highway links Western Australia 's capital city Perth with its northernmost port , Wyndham . With a length of almost 3 @,@ 200 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 000 mi ) , it is the longest highway in Australia , with the majority included as part of the Perth Darwin National Highway . The highway is constructed as a sealed , predominantly two @-@ lane single carriageway , but with some single @-@ lane bridges in the Kimberley . Great Northern Highway travels through remote areas of the state , and is the only sealed road link between the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia . Economically , it provides vital access through the Wheatbelt and Mid West to the resource @-@ rich regions of the Pilbara and Kimberley . In these areas , the key industries of mining , agriculture and pastoral stations , and tourism are all dependent on the highway . 
 In Perth , the highway begins in Midland near Great Eastern Highway , and further north intersects the Reid and Roe highways , which together form Perth 's ring road . There are also three rural highways that spur off Great Northern Highway . Brand Highway and North West Coastal Highway provide an alternative coastal route between Muchea and Port Hedland , while Victoria Highway carries the National Highway route and interstate traffic into the Northern Territory . Various road routes are allocated to sections of Great Northern Highway , including the Highway 1 routes National Route 1 and National Highway 1 , as well as National Highway 95 . 
 The highway was created in 1944 from existing roads in the Wheatbelt and a series of tracks through remote pastoral areas . However , it was a hazardous route that could be dusty in the dry season , and boggy or washed away in the wet season . Some sections were effectively impassable sand , while others contained limestone outcrops . Economic growth and development in northern Western Australia prompted initial improvement efforts , and the federal government 's Beef Roads Scheme in the 1960s resulted in a noticeably higher @-@ quality road in the Kimberley . Construction of a sealed road from Perth to Wyndham , including numerous bridges to reduce the impact of seasonal flooding , took many years to complete . The last section opened on 16 December 1989 , and received national media coverage . However , by then many older sections were either worn out or not up to modern standards . Various upgrades have been carried out in small sections , across the length of the highway , with further works planned . A major realignment of the highway in Perth is scheduled for construction between 2016 and 2019 , as part of the NorthLink WA project that will also upgrade Tonkin Highway .

 Great Northern Highway is the main north @-@ south route between Perth and the northern areas of Western Australia . Covering a distance of 3 @,@ 195 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 985 mi ) , it is the longest highway in Australia . From Midland in Perth 's north @-@ east , the highway heads generally north @-@ east through the Wheatbelt and Mid West to Newman , north @-@ west to the coastal Pilbara town of Port Hedland , along the coastline to Broome , east to Halls Creek , and finally north to Wyndham , on the state 's northern coastline . Sixty kilometres ( 37 mi ) out from Wyndham , the highway intersects the start of Victoria Highway , which carries interstate traffic to the Northern Territory via Kununurra . Various road routes are allocated to sections of Great Northern Highway , which is mostly a National Highway route , and also forms part of Australia 's Highway 1 . It is signed as National Route 1 from Midland to Middle Swan , National Highway 95 and National Route 1 concurrently from Middle Swan to Muchea , National Highway 95 from Muchea to Mundabullangana , and National Highway 1 from Mundabullangana to Victoria Highway . The vast majority of the highway is a two @-@ lane single carriageway , although as of 2014 there are thirteen single @-@ lane bridges and four single @-@ lane floodways in the Kimberley . The speed limit is 110 kilometres per hour ( 70 mph ) except in and around built up areas . 
 Great Northern Highway travels to remote areas of Western Australia , including the Munjina Roadhouse near the Hamersley Ranges , and the communities of Eighty Mile Beach , Wallal , Sandfire and <unk> , which are located between Broome and Port Hedland . It is the only sealed road between the Northern Territory border and major population centres in the north of the state . Economically , Great Northern Highway is also a vital link in the resource rich regions of the Wheatbelt , Mid West , Pilbara , and Kimberley . The key industries of mining , agriculture , and pastoral stations are all dependent on the highway as a significant and in some cases only method of transport . Tourism accounts for a significant portion of the road 's traffic , and is a growing part of or potential growth source for the regional economies . The highway provides access to a variety of tourist attractions , including New Norcia , the Yilgarn area , and various national parks , including Karijini . Parts of the highway itself are included in the tourist routes Swan Valley Tourist Drive ( Tourist Drive 203 ) in Perth , Chittering Valley Tourist Way ( Tourist Drive 359 ) in Bullsbrook , Midlands Tourist Way ( Tourist Drive 360 ) from Upper Swan to Walebing , and Geikie – <unk> Tourist Way ( Tourist Drive 350 ) from Geikie Gorge National Park to Fitzroy Crossing . 
 Main Roads Western Australia monitors traffic volume across the state 's road network , including various locations along Great Northern Highway . From 2007 / 08 to 2008 / 09 , the recorded traffic volumes ranged between 7 @,@ 830 and 17 @,@ 710 vehicles per weekday in Perth , 510 to 2 @,@ 990 in the Wheatbelt , 470 to 590 in the Mid West , 390 to 10 @,@ 840 in the Pilbara , and 170 to 4 @,@ 090 in the Kimberley . The highest percentage of heavy traffic was 52 @.@ 5 % , north of Newman Drive in the Pilbara . Overall , Great Northern Highway performs favourably in terms of road safety , compared to other major highways in Western Australia . Whilst making up two thirds of the state 's National Highway network , it was the location of only half of all recorded fatalities for 2005 – 2009 . For that period , the sections of the highway from Wubin to the Sandfire Roadhouse , north @-@ east of Port Hedland , were considered by the Australian Automobile Association to be among the lowest risk highway links in the state . However , the section from Perth to Wubin was rated as medium risk , and the northern sections of the highway were rated medium @-@ high and high risk . In 2013 , Great Northern Highway received a similar rating , still higher overall than the other highways . Out of five stars , 21 % was rated as one- or two @-@ star , and 79 % was rated three- or four @-@ star , with the southern and northern ends of the highway generally less safe than the portion from Wubin to the Sandfire Roadhouse .

 Great Northern Highway begins at Morrison Road , Midland , in Perth 's north @-@ eastern suburbs , signed as National Route 1 . Though it originally commenced at Great Eastern Highway , that section is no longer contiguous , and is now named Old Great Northern Highway . The highway heads north through Middle Swan , intersecting the start of Toodyay Road after 1 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 8 mi ) , and then the meeting point of Reid and Roe Highways after another 1 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 9 mi ) . Those highways come together from Perth 's ring road , signed as State Route 3 , and north of this intersection Great Northern Highway is concurrently allocated National Highway 95 and National Route 1 . It continues north through the Swan Valley for 9 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 6 mi ) , passing many wineries , restaurants , and other tourist attractions . The highway crosses the Swan River and intersects West Swan Road , before turning north @-@ east to travel around the residential part of Upper Swan . Great Northern Highway continues north for thirteen kilometres ( 8 mi ) beyond West Swan Road , past larger agricultural properties , to reach Bullsbrook , the last urban area within the Perth Metropolitan Region . After 11 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 7 mi ) beyond Bullsbrook , the highway reaches the edge of the Perth metropolitan area at the City of Swan – Shire of Chittering boundary , where it passes into the Wheatbelt . 
 = = = Wheatbelt = = = 
 In the Wheatbelt , Great Northern Highway links small town sites with the surrounding rural farmland , occasionally passing by remnant patches of woodlands . From the north @-@ eastern edge of Perth , the highway travels north for three kilometres ( 2 mi ) to Muchea , where the Brand Highway and National Route 1 branch off to the north @-@ west . Great Northern Highway and National Highway 95 continue north @-@ east for 26 kilometres ( 16 mi ) . It passes to the west of Lake Chittering , curves east to cross the Brockman River , and then back north to Bindoon . Five kilometres ( 3 mi ) further north , Bindoon – Moora Road branches off to the north @-@ west , while the highway skirts east briefly then continues north , reaching New Norcia after 46 kilometres ( 29 mi ) . The starting point of The Midlands Road is located at Walebing , 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) further north ; from there , Great Northern Highway heads north @-@ east for 18 kilometres ( 11 mi ) to Bindi Bindi , north for 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) to Miling , then east for 33 kilometres ( 21 mi ) to the northern end of Northam – Pithara Road , and shortly thereafter Pithara . From here , another 16 kilometres ( 10 mi ) takes the road to Dalwallinu , and Wubin is 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) further north . 
 = = = Mid West = = = 
 As Great Northern Highway heads north @-@ east from Wubin out of the Wheatbelt , the vegetation changes to arid shrubland . In the Mid West region , the long stretches between settlements show few signs of human activity , other than the highway itself . The first such settlement is Paynes Find , 154 kilometres ( 96 mi ) out from Wubin . At this point the highway heads north again , reaching Mount Magnet after 143 kilometres ( 89 mi ) , and then Cue after another 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) . The road travels north @-@ east for 115 kilometres ( 71 mi ) to Meekatharra , and then has a long 412 @-@ kilometre ( 256 mi ) stretch up to the northern edge of the Mid West at the Fortescue River , near Newman Airport . Halfway along this stretch the highway passes a roadhouse at <unk> . 
 = = = Pilbara = = = 
 Four kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) after crossing the Fortescue River , Great Northern Highway intersects Marble Bar Road , the highway 's original alignment . It proceeds north to Marble Bar , mostly as an unsealed road , whilst the highway deviates north @-@ west , reaching Newman after three kilometres ( 2 mi ) . The flat landscape gives way to gentle ranges , which the highway meanders around as it heads west @-@ north @-@ west for 109 kilometres ( 68 mi ) . It then curves around to the north , proceeding over a distance of 48 kilometres ( 30 mi ) to Karijini Road , the entrance road to the Karijini National Park . The highway continues north for another 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) , travelling through the north @-@ eastern corner of the national park to Nanutarra Munjina Road . Great Northern Highway proceeds on its journey north , crossing the Yule River and its tributaries . The highway then runs parallel to the Turner River over a 220 @-@ kilometre ( 140 mi ) distance until it reaches North West Coastal Highway . This junction is the northern terminus of the National Highway 95 , and Great Northern Highway continues north @-@ east as National Highway 1 – part of Australia 's Highway 1 , which is signed as National Route 1 along North West Coastal Highway . The turnoff for Port Hedland is 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) north @-@ east of the intersection , and from there the highway heads east for 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) to the northern end of Marble Bar Road , and reaching Pardoo after another 72 kilometres ( 45 mi ) . It parallels the coastline thereafter , passing into the Kimberley region shortly after the Pardoo Roadhouse . 
 = = = Kimberley = = = 
 From Pardoo , Great Northern Highway travels north @-@ east , paralleling the coastline for 455 kilometres ( 283 mi ) , and passing Eighty Mile Beach near the Sandfire Roadhouse . The vegetation becomes denser woodlands once more as the highway heads into the Kimberley 's tropical monsoon climate . At Roebuck the highway turns east , heading inland , while Broome Roads spurs off to the west , connecting to Broome . After 145 kilometres ( 90 mi ) , the highway crosses the Fitzroy River on Willare Bridge and reaches the turnoff for Derby , Derby Highway , in Willare . Great Northern Highway continues east for 217 kilometres ( 135 mi ) to Fitzroy Crossing , where it crosses the Fitzroy River a second time . It continues east , curving around the southern side of the Margaret River , and reaching Tanami Road after 272 kilometres ( 169 mi ) . The town of Halls Creek and the Duncan Road turnoff are 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) north @-@ east of there . From here the highway heads north for 313 kilometres ( 194 mi ) , past <unk> to Victoria Highway . The national highway route turns off at Victoria Highway , travelling past Kununurra to cross into the Northern Territory . Great Northern Highway , however , continues north @-@ west without a route number , passing the eastern end of Gibb River Road after eight kilometres ( 5 mi ) , and reaching Wyndham following another 48 kilometres ( 30 mi ) . The highway continues on for six kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) to reach the original townsite and the harbour , where it takes on the local names <unk> Street , McPhee Street , and Harbour Road .

 = = = Highway origins = = = 
 The name Great Northern Highway was first proposed in October 1940 by the state 's Nomenclature Advisory Committee , to describe the main route from Midland to Geraldton , Western Australia . This was following the naming of the Great Eastern and Great Southern highways . The Midland Junction Municipal Council approved the name , however at the Geraldton Municipal Council meeting , one councillor suggested that Great Midland Highway would be a better name . The reasoning was that Geraldton was in the centre of the state 's coastline , not in the north . It was explained that the highway would continue north past Geraldton , and the council voted to approve the name . 
 By July 1941 , the Nomenclature Advisory Committee 's proposal had expanded to three highway names for the roads in the state 's northern areas : Great Northern Highway for " the road from Midland Junction Town Hall to Wyndham , via Walebing , Pithara , Wubin , Payne 's Find , Mt . Magnet , Cue , <unk> , Meekatharra , Roy Hill , Nullagine , Marble Bar , <unk> , De Grey , Pardoo , Wallal , Anna Plains , Le Grange , Broome , Derby , <unk> , Fitzroy Crossing , Christmas Creek , Louisa Downs , Hall 's Creek and Turkey Creek " , North West Coastal Highway for " the road from Geraldton to De Grey , via Northampton , Galena , Carnarvon , <unk> , Winning Pool , <unk> , <unk> , Onslow , <unk> , Mardie , Karratha , Roebourne , Whim Creek , Mundabullangana and Port Hedland " , and Geraldton Highway for " the road from Walebing to Geraldton via <unk> " . The proposal was well received by the local municipal councils and road boards . 
 The name Great Northern Highway was gazetted on 10 March 1944 , under section 10 of the Land Act , 1933 – 1939 . However , the highway was mostly a series of tracks through remote pastoral areas , with the sealed road ending just past the Wheatbelt town of Miling in 1950 . Driving was difficult and hazardous all year round . The road was very dusty in the dry season , and some sections of the road were effectively impassable sand , while other sections contained limestone outcrops that damaged tyres . During the wet season , when rivers flooded , sections of road were essentially bogs , or worse still , were completely washed away .

 = = = = Initial efforts = = = = 
 Economic growth and development in Western Australia 's northern regions in the 1940s prompted the state to quadruple road funding between 1946 and 1952 . Five " gangs " of workers were allocated to a 1 @,@ 600 @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 600 km ) length of Great Northern Highway between Meekatharra and Wyndham . However , given the vast distance the highway travelled , and destructive cyclones in the Pilbara and Gascoyne that could destroy multiple weeks worth of work , the overall improvement was relatively insignificant . Over time , though , the road was improved . New alignments were constructed , such as between Derby and Fitzroy Crossing in the late 1940s , which had originally followed the curve of the Fitzroy River , along its floodplain , and could only be used in the dry season . The new alignment was a more direct 180 @-@ mile ( 290 km ) section , with the first five miles ( 8 km ) sealed , a total of 68 miles ( 109 km ) of gravel road , and the remainder simply formed earth . Despite this low construction standard , the road remained passable except for short periods during heavy rain . 
 = = = = Beef Roads Scheme = = = = 
 In 1961 , the federal government passed the Western Australian Grants ( Beef Cattle Roads ) Act 1961 , known as the Beef Roads Scheme , that encouraged road building in the Kimberley . This had followed on from an earlier federal grant scheme in 1949 for the construction of a road from Nicholson to Wyndham . The road allowed trucks to efficiently transport cattle to port , rather than the slow cattle drives that could lose stock and take weeks to complete . The 1961 Beef Roads Scheme initially included upgrading the Wyndham to Halls Creek section of Great Northern Highway as one of three projects in the region . One year later the scheme was expanded to include the Broome to Halls Creek section of the highway , and several bridge construction projects . However , the resources allocated to Great Northern Highway were needed to maintain the highway as an unsealed road in a usable condition , rather than to completely seal the roadway . In 1963 , work was completed on stabilising a 42 @-@ mile ( 68 km ) sandy section to prevent vehicles from becoming bogged , a 29 @-@ mile ( 47 km ) section was realigned to avoid the Fortescue River floodplain , and 25 miles ( 40 km ) between Marble Bar and Port Hedland was also realigned to minimise the effects of wet weather . 
 = = = = Perth to Newman = = = = 
 The projects funded by the Beef Roads Scheme resulted in a noticeably higher quality road in the Kimberley , but work still progressed on other sections of the highway . In 1970 , a single @-@ lane sealed section was completed between Perth and Meekatharra . The project was one of the first in the state to be constructed by contractors rather than by Main Roads directly . It cost $ 9 million , two @-@ thirds of which was spent after 1959 . The next section to be upgraded and sealed was from Meekatharra to Newman , a 414 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 257 mi ) project that would take four and a half years to construct . Due to the remoteness of the location , airstrips were built alongside the highway , so that workers could be flown in from Geraldton . The highway was realigned in several spots , to avoid difficult areas , improve river crossings , or give drivers a more scenic view of the surrounding area . New bridges were constructed along the route , including a reinforced concrete bridge at the Fortescue River , and a four @-@ span bridge over the Gascoyne River 's Middle Branch . By December 1978 , the sealed road reached Newman , with the project completed three months ahead of schedule , and at a cost of $ 20 million , $ 1 million under budget . With a 7 @.@ 4 @-@ metre @-@ wide ( 24 ft ) seal and 2 @.@ 4 @-@ metre @-@ wide ( 8 ft ) shoulders , the road could easily accommodate two lanes of traffic . Previously sealed sections , totalling 485 kilometres ( 301 mi ) of the highway , were less than half that width . Premier Charles Court opened the new and improved highway on 12 December 1978 . 
 = = = = Port Hedland to Wyndham = = = = 
 The two @-@ lane sealed road between Halls Creek and Wyndham was also completed in 1978 . It involved the construction of 21 bridges , and extensive earthworks designed to blend the road into the terrain . The section was opened on 23 July 1978 by the Minister for Transport , at a cost of over $ 20 million . Meanwhile , work on sealing and upgrading the 476 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 296 mi ) section from Port Hedland and Broome began in 1976 . With up to five contractors and four Main Roads teams working throughout the project , it was completed at an extraordinarily rapid pace . It opened in April 1981 at a cost of $ 56 million . With the opening of this section , tourist traffic escalated . Cape <unk> , Eighty Mile Beach , and Broome became increasingly favoured destinations , especially for residents of the Pilbara . 
 Work accelerated in the 1980s as part of the Australian Bicentenary Road Development program . From October 1982 , the program provided $ 2 @.@ 5 billion to upgrade the country 's roads in the lead up to Australia 's bicentenary in 1988 . By this time , the only sections of Great Northern Highway yet to be sealed were a 275 @-@ kilometre ( 171 mi ) stretch from Fitzroy Crossing to Halls Creek , and another 416 kilometres ( 258 mi ) between Newman and Port Hedland . Construction of the Fitzroy Crossing to Halls Creek section began in October 1981 . The route had been surveyed in 1979 ; with the collaboration of the Western Australian Museum , Main Roads ensured it would not impact important Aboriginal heritage sites . After five years of work , including the construction of nine bridges , the widened and sealed section was completed on 7 September 1986 . At the time , this was the final section of the nationwide Highway 1 to be sealed , and there was national interest . The media captured the completion on camera , while the federal Minister for Transport , Peter Morris , together with the Western Australian Minister for the North West , Ernie Bridge , rode on the bitumen truck for the final spray . With this section completed , the Newman to Port Hedland section of Great Northern Highway was the only significant section of unsealed highway in Western Australia . 
 = = = = Newman to Port Hedland = = = = 
 A realignment of the highway between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976 , which would see the road deviate to the west at Newman , and travel via <unk> instead of Marble Bar . In the early 1980s , eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads . The potential impacts on the natural environment , regional economy , tourism , and resident population were considered , with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range . 
 As the highway would pass through the Hamersley National Park , the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was required for the Newman to White Springs section . Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads , which found that the key risks were erosion , visual impact , and possible damage to flora . A detailed survey was carried out , which included the use of laser and infra @-@ red measuring devices from within a helicopter , and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites . A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced , and the project was approved in mid @-@ 1984 . 
 In early 1986 , the contract for this 12 @-@ kilometre ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) segment through the Munjina and <unk> East gorges was awarded . Construction of this segment involved tight control over earthworks and machinery movements , to protect the National Park ecology . The finished road was a scenic route curving down through the Munjina Gorge and out onto the Fortescue River flood plain , with cuttings and embankments blending it in with the natural environment . It was opened on 12 June 1987 by the federal Minister for Transport , Peter Morris , having cost $ 28 @.@ 4 million . 
 Other portions of the Newman – Port Hedland link were completed over the next two years , with the last part officially opened on 16 December 1989 by Bob Brown and Bob Pearce , the federal and state transport ministers . This last section of Great Northern Highway also completed the sealing of the National Highway , and the opening ceremony , held on location 212 kilometres ( 132 mi ) south of Port Hedland , received national media coverage . 
 = = = Fitzroy River crossing , Willare = = = 
 In the late 1960s , Main Roads investigated alternative crossing points over the Fitzroy River , to replace the existing low @-@ level bridge at <unk> . Flooding in January 1966 had demonstrated that Willare was the best site . The new route would be eight miles ( 13 km ) longer , and required two bridges , but would result in a better quality road . When tenders were called , the river flooded again , washing away 170 feet ( 52 m ) of the old bridge . Rather than reconstruct the low @-@ level crossing , the construction timeframe was shortened from 18 months to 38 weeks . The 1 @,@ 280 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 390 m ) Willare Bridge and 640 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 200 m ) Minnie River Bridge opened on 12 June 1968 , having cost almost $ 700 @,@ 000 . While situated seven feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) higher than the worst known flood level , the single @-@ lane bridges were designed to accommodate more extensive flood levels , with the water flowing over them if necessary . 
 By the early 1980s , it was clear that the Fitzroy River crossing was still inadequate . Seasonal flooding had closed the road several times , and damaged the embankments leading up the bridges . The crossing had been closed for twenty four days in 1982 ; while in 1983 , the most severe flooding since 1914 extensively damaged 2 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) of the highway , closing it for twenty @-@ five days . To alleviate the problem , two new bridges were built in 1985 , and the road was widened and raised two to three metres ( 6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in ) above the flood plain . The earthworks for the project included constructing guide banks to direct excess water to flow over floodways , which were protected with rocks . This was designed to minimise the time the road would be closed in such a scenario . The $ 11 million upgraded crossing was opened on 19 December 1985 by the federal Minister for Transport , Peter Morris . Then , one month later , Cyclone Hector produced 70 % more water than the crossing had been designed for . Water overflowed the road all along the flood plain , not just at designated floodways , ravaging the shoulders and then destroying sections of road . Four to five kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 1 mi ) of the highway was washed away , leaving the bridges isolated and disconnected . The road was closed from 27 January to 14 February 1986 , with $ 200 @,@ 000 spent just to make the crossing passable . It was then redesigned and rebuilt at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 9 million to make it more flood resistant . 
 = = = Further improvements = = = 
 Despite the provision of a completely sealed road , there was still much work to be done on the highway , with many older sections either worn out or not up to modern standards . Narrow sections were widened to a full seven metres ( 23 ft ) , and repairs made to the road , shoulders , fencing , and line markings as required , with work carried out in sections and progressing along the length of the highway . Four overtaking lanes were constructed between Mount Magnet and Cue in 1991 ; and between 1991 and 1993 , there were eight contracts awarded to widen , reconstruct , and seal a combined total of more than 190 kilometres ( 120 mi ) of the highway . 
 A range of projects were carried out across the length of the highway between 1996 and 2006 . By 1998 , a 157 @-@ kilometre ( 98 mi ) section between the Sandfire Roadhouse and Victoria Highway had been improved at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 1 million , and another 42 kilometres ( 26 mi ) north of Meekatharra was improved for $ 12 million in 1999 . Two bridges were constructed in the vicinity of Halls Creek in 2000 , and another four in 2004 / 05 , replacing floodways so that the highway would remain open during floods . Similarly , 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) north of Halls Creek , the 240 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 0 @.@ 15 mi ) <unk> Bridge over the Ord River was constructed to replace a single @-@ lane floodway , and was opened in January 2003 . That same year , the bridges over the Fortescue and Gascoyne Rivers were strengthened to increase the highway 's load capacity . Modifications were made to the steep ascent of the Darling Scarp at Bindoon Hill between February 2002 and April 2003 , and Great Northern Highway was realigned to bypass the Dalwallinu town centre . 
 Work on Great Northern Highway has been continuous . From 2004 to 2010 , the Muchea to Wubin section was upgraded , with parts reconstructed and realigned , and traffic lights installed at the intersection with Brand Highway . In the Kimberley , five sections between Halls Creek and Victoria Highway were improved between 2008 and 2009 with regards to pavement strength , alignment , safety , and flood resistance . From 2005 to 2010 , the Perth section , through the Swan Valley , was upgraded , with the road widened , turning and overtaking lanes constructed , and street lighting improved . Construction of a realignment around Port Hedland 's <unk> industrial area , including a new parclo interchange at Wilson Street , began towards the end of 2012 . It was opened to traffic on 17 June 2014 , and on 23 July 2014 , Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss , Federal Member for Durack Melissa Price , and Pilbara MLA Brendon Grylls officially opened the project . It was finalised in August . In October 2013 , construction began on a project to straighten and widen Great Northern Highway 's curves around Bindi Bindi . The project was completed and opened to traffic on 27 February 2015 , and allowed the speed limit to be raised from 80 to 110 km / h ( 50 to 70 mph ) . A 21 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 13 mi ) section between Batty Bog Road ( north of New Norcia ) and Walebing was reconstructed between September 2014 and 2015 .

 Further upgrading is planned for Great Northern Highway at its southern end , as well as elsewhere along the highway . Planning has been completed for widening an 11 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometre ( 7 @.@ 1 mi ) section of Fitzroy Crossing , including replacing two single @-@ lane bridges . As of 2014 , the project is awaiting federal approval , and construction is unfunded . 
 = = = Perth Darwin National Highway = = = 
 In the early 1990s , a corridor study conducted by Main Roads into the long @-@ term needs of the Perth to Darwin National Highway concluded the existing Great Northern Highway , with bypasses around rural towns and the Swan Valley , was the most suitable route for the National Highway . Planning the alignment for the southernmost section , from Reid Highway in Perth to Bindoon , was undertaken from 2003 to 2013 . It resulted in the planned alignment commencing from Tonkin Highway , bypassing the Swan Valley and Bullsbrook before reconnecting with Great Northern Highway near Brand Highway . Great Northern Highway is then followed until the Brockman River , where the planned route deviates to the east to bypass Bindoon , reconnecting with the existing Highway near Bindoon – Moora Road . 
 The first stage of construction is being undertaken as part of the NorthLink WA project . Tonkin Highway 's northern section will be grade separated , and the road extended northwards past Ellenbrook to Great Northern Highway near Brand Highway . The previously planned route of the bypass , prior to 2012 , followed Lord Street , east of Whiteman Park . The project is funded by both the state and federal governments . Construction is expected to begin in 2016 , and be completed by 2019 .

 In late 2015 Main Roads completed a planning review for an upgrade of the highway between Muchea and Wubin .

 " Dexter " , or " Pilot " , is the pilot episode of the first season television drama series Dexter , which premiered on October 1 , 2006 on Showtime in the United States . The episode was written by developer James Manos , Jr. and directed by Michael Cuesta . It was based on the opening of the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay . The pilot introduces the series ' protagonist , Dexter Morgan ( Michael C. Hall ) , a Miami Metro Police Department blood spatter analyst with a double life as a serial killer . While solving murders in the Homicide division , Dexter also spends his time hunting and killing murderers and criminals who have escaped the justice system . The pilot introduces the " Ice Truck Killer " , a serial killer who targets prostitutes and leaves their bodies dismembered and bloodless , and the rivalry that develops between the killer and Dexter . 
 Jeff Lindsay was initially against casting Michael C. Hall to play Dexter , but changed his mind after seeing him speak only one line of the script . The crew began filming the pilot in Miami , but were unable to finish due to the overlap of production with the hurricane season . In spite of a subsidy from the state of Florida , the crew moved to Los Angeles , where the remainder of filming took place ; footage shot in both Miami and Los Angeles were used in the episode . " Dexter " was watched by over one million viewers , giving Showtime its highest ratings in almost two years . Critical reception of the pilot was mostly positive , though critics of Variety , LA Weekly , and The Wall Street Journal found that it was " unpleasant " to watch . 
 In 2007 , CBS announced that it would broadcast the show over the public airwaves , which sparked controversy with the Parents Television Council ( PTC ) . The PTC did not want the show to be broadcast because it " compelled viewers to empathize with a serial killer " ; in response , CBS replaced expletives , cut out bloody scenes and gave the show a TV @-@ 14 rating . The eventual premiere of the show on CBS was on February 17 , 2008 , and was watched by 8 @.@ 1 million viewers . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The pilot commences with Dexter driving through Miami , summarizing , in a monologue , that something is to occur on that night . After a choir performance at a bandstand , Dexter kidnaps Mike Donovan ( Jim Abele ) , a pastor who rapes and murders young boys , takes him to a remote cabin in the Everglades , and forces him to look at the bodies of his victims . Before sedating him , Dexter explains that he could never kill a child , because he abides by a moral code . Later , Donovan awakes to find himself strapped to a table . Dexter makes an incision in Donovan 's cheek with a scalpel and collects his blood in a slide , and then proceeds to kill him . Dexter , returning from dumping Donovan 's remains , narrates that he is not sure why he feels the need to kill , and speaks of his adoptive parents , Harry and Doris Morgan , both of whom are dead . At his apartment , Dexter stores Donovan 's blood in a case containing the blood of his other victims . Dexter explains that he kills according to a code taught to him by his foster father who , as a Miami police officer , instructed Dexter on how to avoid being caught , and to kill only those who " deserve it " . Flashbacks throughout the episode reveal that Harry first decided to impart these " lessons " upon Dexter after discovering that the boy had been killing neighborhood pets . 
 Dexter receives a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan ( Jennifer Carpenter ) , a police officer in the vice department and , Dexter believes , the only person who loves him . Debra says she is at a crime scene and wants him to be there , because she needs his help . Dexter arrives and Debra , undercover as a prostitute , informs him that another hooker has been killed , the third in five months . Dexter inspects the victim and is shocked to learn that the chopped up corpse is bloodless . Dexter leaves , awed by the killer 's technique , and says that due to the lack of blood he can 't help out . At the police station , Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes ( Erik King ) , who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something . Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion , rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be . Dexter <unk> Jamie Jaworski , a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant , and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime . Once he confirms that Jaworski is guilty , Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett ( Julie Benz ) , a domestic violence victim . Because of her violent past with her husband , Rita has no interest in sex , and Dexter secretly feels comfortable with the lack of intimacy . Rita has two young children , Astor and Cody , whom Dexter genuinely feels for . While on a date with Rita , Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood ; this time , however , the head is missing . Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold , explaining the absence of blood . Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders . Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory , but their superior officer , Lt. María LaGuerta ( Lauren Vélez ) , who dislikes Debra , dismisses it . 
 Dexter captures Jaworski , who admits his guilt and explains that he has no remorse for his act . After killing Jaworski , Dexter drives to see Rita , but is sidetracked when he sees a refrigerated truck . Dexter follows the truck , and the driver throws a severed head at Dexter 's car . When the police squad arrives , LaGuerta confirms that Doakes ' case was indeed a crime of passion . Dexter arrives at Rita 's apartment , where she expresses interest in taking their relationship to a more intimate level , under the impression that this is what Dexter wants . Dexter feels uncomfortable and is saved when Rita 's son , Cody , gets sick next door and needs his mother to pick him up . When Dexter arrives home , he finds a doll 's head on his refrigerator door . Inside the freezer , he finds the other parts of the doll , severed just like the bloodless bodies of the dead women . Dexter views the doll as an invitation to play , which he accepts gladly .

 Showtime began developing the series at the start of 2005 , planning for it to be based on the novel by Jeff Lindsay . By February , Emmy @-@ winning writer James Manos , Jr . ( a writer for The Sopranos ) was on board to write the pilot script with John Goldwyn , with Sara Colleton as executive producer . By June 13 , 2005 , Showtime had given the show a green @-@ light to be aired for the next year . The premise of the episode follows the same storyline as Jeff Lindsay 's novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter , the first in the series of novels on which the television show is based , albeit with many additional elements and altered characters . Dexter was released on Showtime as part of a batch of new programs for the network , along with Brotherhood , This American Life and a reality TV series called Sexual Healing . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Michael C. Hall received the script for Dexter in July 2005 , after just having finished the fifth and final season of HBO 's Six Feet Under . Hall was one of the few cast members not to audition for their roles ; Robert Greenblatt and Michael Cuesta approached him with the script . Hall said that he didn 't think " the role was created with me in mind but I think that once the pilot script emerged at Showtime , both Robert Greenblatt and Michael Cuesta independently thought of me for the role and then approached me about it . " 
 Hall was in New York and thinking of going back to theatre work , and had no intention of returning to television so quickly . However , he changed his mind after reading the script , because he was " intrigued by the macabre mix of dark humor , chilling violence , and a unique central character . " He also said that he " realized it was a big commitment and certainly appreciated that coming off of Six Feet Under " but said that he " couldn 't pass it up " . Lindsay was initially against casting Hall , based on seeing him on Six Feet Under , but after he saw Hall speak one line of the script , Lindsay changed his mind , describing Hall as " absolutely perfect " to portray Dexter . To prepare for the part , Hall read various books on the psychology of serial killers , read transcripts of interviews with serial killers , and spent time with the head blood @-@ spatter analyst at the Miami precinct . He also watched people in New York restaurants to get a feel for what it would be like to stalk them . 
 Julie Benz was given a copy of the script in 2005 , and was asked to audition for the part of Rita Bennett . She was surprised she was asked to audition , because the script was " one of the best pilot scripts [ she ] ever read . " She also read for the part of Debra , and joked that she would have auditioned for Dexter 's role had she been able to . Benz had been a " disgustingly huge " fan of Michael C. Hall from his role in Six Feet Under and she said in an interview with Vanity Fair that " I was such a fan of his from Six Feet Under , to the point where my cell @-@ phone ring was the show ’ s theme song . I had to change it once I got cast ! " . The script was also presented to James Remar , who auditioned for the part of Harry Morgan , because it was a character he " really related to " and had waited for most of his life to play . 
 As a former police officer , actor David Zayas was immediately interested in the role of Sgt. Angel Batista . After appearing in Oz for a season , Erik King , was looking for a " different " acting chance , he " loved " the character of Sgt. Doakes , after reading the script . South Korean actor C.S. Lee , who has a recurring role on the show as forensics specialist Vince Masuka , was asked for the part after Dexter producers recognized him in guest parts on Spin City , Law & Order : Criminal Intent and The Sopranos . Lee accepted the part because of the " fantastic " writing . By September 15 , Jennifer Carpenter had joined the cast to play the part of Debra Morgan . Carpenter had enough time before her audition to read the Dexter books , but admitted that she " didn ’ t exactly see myself in the books . I knew that it was going to be a TV show and that it had the potential to go for five to seven years , so I tried to make Deb as similar to me as possible and to bring out the parts of myself that were like Deb . I think that may have helped in the audition and it has certainly helped sustain such a long run with one character . " She also stated that she enjoyed cursing on television , but found it hard to stop it creeping into her real life . In June 2006 Geoff Pierson was cast as Cpt . Matthews . The series stars Lauren Vélez ( Maria LaGuerta ) , David Zayas ( Angel Batista ) and Erik King ( James Doakes ) , all previously starred in the American HBO television drama series Oz . 
 = = = Filming , editing and cinematography = = = 
 Filming of the episode took place in Miami and Los Angeles . Shooting began on the first episode on 18 September . The network took advantage of the Florida Film Commission incentive program which provided a 15 % rebate of all money spent in Florida on the production ( which was up to $ 2 million ) to encourage film and television production in the state . The incentive was first launched in 2003 , and was refunded by the state legislature for 2006 with $ 10 million , its largest budget to date . President of Entertainment at Showtime , Robert Greenblatt said " I 've always felt that location is a strong starring character and adds to the success of many shows . " 
 The crew originally wanted to shoot the entire pilot in Miami , but during the first two weeks of filming , three hurricanes went by : Katrina , Rita , and Wilma . Since further filming was to take place during the hurricane season , and it was not possible to get insurance , the crew was forced to move to elsewhere . Though the state of Florida offered a US $ 450 @,@ 000 subsidy , the Dexter crew relocated to Los Angeles . Executive producer Sara Colleton explained that the filming crew tried to create a different version of Miami in Los Angeles , that differed from the " glossy look " Miami has in CSI : Miami and Miami Vice . " Dexter " was shot in HD ; cinematographer Romeo Tirone said he experienced some difficulties because HD " sees everything . " As opposed to Dexter 's " disturbing " environment , Tirone tried to give Rita 's home a " warmer , safer , happier place " with " a dark side to it , " doing so by letting more light come through the windows . Editor Elena Maganini was contacted by episode director Michael Cuesta after he saw her previous work with director John McNaughton ; Maganini had previously worked on a serial killer movie entitled Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer . Michael Cuesta said that when he met Elena he " ... thought she had great instincts , was relaxed and didn ’ t pretend to know exactly who this character was . " He said that " ... that , and all her work with John McNaughton , helped convince me to bring her onto the pilot . She ’ s done serial killers ; she ’ s done noirs . She gets that world . " 
 Veteran television editor Scott K. Wallace was hired later , on Maganini 's suggestion . Wallace and Maganini had already worked with each other on Tarzan . They worked on the flashback sequences in the episode , which they tried to make " very dreamlike , " identifying as Dexter 's " Dark Passenger , " which urges Dexter to kill as explained in Lindsay 's novels . After the pilot was filmed , the footage filmed in Miami was mixed with the footage of Los Angeles .

 The first scene , with Dexter cruising through the Miami streets , was filmed on location , along Ocean Drive in South Beach . They used Ocean Drive again for the scene in which Dexter strolls through the streets with an ice cream , before meeting with Rita and once more , in the same street , for the next episode , Crocodile , for the scene whereby Dexter and Debra find the Ice truck killer 's truck . They also used a gazebo in a park in Miami Springs , Florida , located around seven miles northwest of Miami , for the boy choir scene in which shortly after the choir ends , Dexter kidnaps Mike Donovan . They used several water locations in Miami , to illustrate Dexter on his boat , the " Slice of Life " . These locations include Biscayne Bay and Virginia Key island ( used for the flashbacks of the 8 @-@ year old Dexter , talking with Harry about his homicidal tendencies , and then later re @-@ used in Crocodile ) . The condo used to portray Dexter 's apartment is also in Miami . The Seven Seas Motel is an actual location and they didn 't change the name for the motel . There is genuinely a pool outside and the room 105 was rented for the day for them to shoot in it . They also shot in Doral Park Country Club to portray the valet station where Jaworski works .

 The house used for Rita 's abode is actually in Long Beach , California , and is in a residential area known as Los Altos . The Los Altos neighborhood has been used extensively in shooting Dexter . The team used 6 different homes in that area alone in the first season : Dexter 's childhood home , Angel 's house , the house of the neighbor with the noisy dog , the Dade City house that Dexter inherits from his biological father , and the house of the old lady across the street . It 's also close to the intersection where the " Ice Truck Killer " stopped his car to check on his captive ( Debra ) in the car trunk .

 As promotion for the show , Showtime posted a preview of the pilot on their website . In September 2006 , CBS and YouTube struck a strategic content and advertising partnership , and the YouTube CBS Brand Channel started including daily contributions from the Showtime network , including promotional video clips from its critically acclaimed original series , such as Dexter . On October 28 , after the first few episodes had aired , Showtime made it easier for viewers to catch up with the show by dedicating a whole night to showing the first five episodes . 
 = = CBS broadcast controversy = = 
 In December 2007 , CBS announced that it was considering Dexter for broadcast over the public airwaves , making Dexter the first show in 20 years to air on a broadcast network after it had been shown on a premium cable channel . However , the Parents Television Council ( PTC ) publicly protested the decision , because of the show 's graphic violence . In a 2008 press release , PTC president Tim Winter stated the following : 
 We are formally asking CBS to cancel its plan to air the first season of Dexter on its television network . This show is not suitable for airing on broadcast television ; it should remain on a premium subscription cable network . The biggest problem with the series is something that no amount of editing can get around : the series compels viewers to empathize with a serial killer , to root for him to prevail , to hope he doesn ’ t get discovered . Dexter introduces audiences to the depths of depravity and indifference as it chronicles the main character 's troubled quest for vigilante justice by celebrating graphic , premeditated murder . 
 Although some critics objected to Dexter 's edited broadcast , CBS , in response to the PTC , moved it up to a later timeslot and replaced expletives , using substitutes such as " frickin ' " and " mother lover " . Also , the scene in the car , in which Dexter inappropriately touches Rita thinking of bloodless bodies was removed . In addition , bloody scenes were cut out by the network , as well as giving the show a TV @-@ 14 Rating . While the PTC was still against CBS airing the episode , CBS eventually broadcast the episode on February 17 , 2008 .

 = = = Critical reaction = = = 
 Reviews of the pilot were generally positive . David Hinckley of the New York Daily News called it " bold , different and exciting , with a central character and performance that take your breath away " . Hinckley praised Hall 's dynamic Emmy @-@ worthy performance , and the " indispensable and haunting " narration . Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune claimed " to deny yourself the engrossing Dexter based on its subject matter would be to miss out on one of television 's most fiendishly intelligent new dramas " . Ryan enjoyed the series ' black comedy aspects , which she thought were " infused with the most pitch @-@ dark irony on television " . Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe was impressed by Hall 's grand performance , especially in his ability to make Dexter likable . Gilbert praised the set designers , comparing the crime scenes to a Vanity Fair photo spread . 
 Critics reacted positively to the character of Dexter . Entertainment Weekly 's Josh Wolk called him " the hippest @-@ looking killer since American Psycho 's Patrick Bateman " . The San Francisco Chronicle 's Tim Goodman said " What makes the series work so well is twofold . Hall is magnificent ; it 's another sterling performance from him . But instead of being pent up yet emotionally explosive , like his David Fisher on " Six Feet Under , " he 's cool and calculated and entirely without compassion as Dexter . That makes him alluring , in a strange <unk> while Ryan found him to be " among the more compelling characters on the small screen " . Gilbert described Dexter as a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling , calling him a vigilante obsessive murderer with a slippery personality , but " also a hero of sorts " . <unk> reviewer Mathan Erhardt said that the episode did not quite meet his expectations and that " to me the major flaw in the show is Dexter ’ s noir @-@ esque narration " , although he finished the review by saying " Dexter , despite it ’ s [ sic ] flaws is yet another reason why Sunday night is one of my favorite nights to watch TV . " 
 IGN gave the pilot episode an " Outstanding " rating of 9 out of 10 , with Dan Iverson starting his review by saying " Every once and a while [ sic ] a show will come along that will be so creepy and so intriguing that you feel compelled to watch . Dexter is one of those shows . " and summarized with " The pilot episode did an extremely good job hooking us into the world of Dexter . We are meant to feel confused by his actions , and only time will tell how the show deals with this topic - will Dexter ever go too far , making us turn on our protagonist ? There are so many questions that we have about this show , and that is a good thing . Personally we cannot wait to see how long this game of cat @-@ and @-@ mouse goes on with the unknown serial killer and Dexter . With the solid introduction to the series , characters , and future storylines , we can 't help but recommend Dexter to anybody that is at all curious about the show . " IGN reviewer Matt Fowler later placed Mike Donovan third on a list of " Dexter 's Top 10 Kills " , saying " We all remember our first . First car . First love . First staph infection . And when it comes to Dexter , first kill . No Mike Donovan , the church choir master , wasn 't Dexter first dead body , but he was our televisual introduction into Dexter 's wicked world of revenge and reckoning . " IGN also declared the show as the " Best New Psycho Drama of 2006 " . 
 TVSquad reviewer Jonathon Toomey gave the first episode 9 out of 10 and said of it that " This show is legit , well @-@ worth watching . The only reason I 'm holding back that last star is because the screener DVD I received only had the pilot episode and I suppose it 's possible that the show could go downhill after that . But I wouldn 't bet on it . " Toomey also later added another review of the premiere , stating that " I 'm worried though . Dexter is good . In fact , it 's really good . That 's why I 'm worried . Why ? Because Showtime has a nasty little habit of canceling great shows . There was The Chris Isaak Show . Then Dead Like Me . The most recent casualty ? Huff . All three of those shows were spectacular . And you know what ? Dexter is better than all of them . So , yeah ... I 'm worried . " 
 However , not all reviews were as positive . Robert Abele of LA Weekly thought the pilot was average , containing " fashionable gore , occasionally witty dialogue , serviceable suspense and boilerplate police @-@ department politics " . Abele felt that the series was a superhero tale , rather than the dark comedy , police thriller and brooding drama that it was promoted to be . Brian Lowry of Variety did not think that Dexter would impress critics , and noted , " antics of the deranged ... aren 't really all that pleasant to watch " , but praised Hall 's acting saying that he " ... quickly dispatches any thoughts of his " Six Feet " character , which , by itself , represents quite an accomplishment . " Nancy DeWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal felt that the " grotesqueries of Dexter are not something that can easily be dismissed with the old ' you don 't have to watch ' line . We don 't have to watch . We do have to live among the viewers who will be desensitized , or aroused , by this show " .

 = De Lackner HZ @-@ 1 Aerocycle = 
 The HZ @-@ 1 Aerocycle , also known as the <unk> @-@ 2 and by the manufacturer 's designation DH @-@ 4 Heli @-@ Vector , was an American one @-@ man " personal helicopter " developed by de Lackner Helicopters in the mid @-@ 1950s . Intended to be operated by inexperienced pilots with a minimum of 20 minutes of instruction , the HZ @-@ 1 was expected to become a standard reconnaissance machine with the United States Army . Although early testing showed that the craft had promise for providing mobility on the atomic battlefield , more extensive evaluation proved that the aircraft was in fact too difficult to control for operation by untrained infantrymen , and after a pair of crashes the project was abandoned . A single model of the craft was put on display . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 During the early 1950s , Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) developed a system for control of a rotorcraft in which , with the rotors mounted on the underside of the aircraft , the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight , and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes . Known as kinesthetic control , and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard , it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time . NACA testing proved that the idea had merit , and several companies , including <unk> Aircraft , Hiller Aircraft , and de Lackner Helicopters , began development of rotorcraft using the concept . 
 The concept proposed by de Lackner Helicopters was a one @-@ man flying platform , and it received the company designation " DH @-@ 4 " . The DH @-@ 4 was expected to be able to carry up to 120 pounds ( 54 kg ) of cargo or an auxiliary 5 @-@ US @-@ gallon ( 19 l ; 4 @.@ 2 imp gal ) fuel tank to extend its range up to 50 miles ( 80 km ) in addition to its pilot ; in addition , a cargo lifting line could be threaded through the rotor shaft for the carrying of slung loads underneath the craft . 
 The machine was a simple , cross @-@ shaped frame , with the pilot standing on a platform , secured by a safety harness . The harness also secured the aircraft 's engine , which was an outboard motor manufactured by Mercury Marine . The engine was controlled by a twist @-@ grip motorcycle @-@ style throttle and transferred power to the 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) diameter , contra @-@ rotating rotors via belt drive with a chain reduction unit . The aircraft 's landing gear consisted of airbags at the end of each arm of the frame along with a large rubber float in the middle , allowing for amphibious capability , although this arrangement was later replaced by a pair of conventional helicopter @-@ type skids . 
 = = Testing = = 
 Originally designated <unk> @-@ 2 by the U.S. Army , then later re @-@ designated HZ @-@ 1 and named " Aerocycle " , the prototype made its first tethered flight on 22 November 1954 , with its first free flight taking place in January 1955 at the Brooklyn Army Terminal . Over 160 flights totaling more than 15 hours of flight time were conducted , and the results of this early test flight program were considered promising enough that a dozen examples of the type were ordered ( serial numbers 56 @-@ <unk> to 56 @-@ <unk> ) . Predictions were made that the craft could provide transport to a modern version of the old horse cavalry , providing airborne " eyes and ears " for the Army . 
 In 1956 , the test program was transferred to Fort Eustis , Virginia , where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test @-@ flying duties . The HZ @-@ 1 had been designed to be very easy to fly , and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes , and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required . In addition , the HZ @-@ 1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army . Sundby , however , quickly determined that the craft was much more difficult to fly than had been expected , and would not be safe in the hands of an inexperienced pilot . In addition , the low @-@ mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris . 
 Over a series of tethered and free @-@ flying test flights lasting up to 43 minutes , the HZ @-@ 1 suffered a pair of accidents . Both crashes occurred under similar conditions – the contra @-@ rotating rotors <unk> and collided , the blades shattering , causing an immediate loss of control resulting in a crash . Aerodynamic testing was conducted in the full @-@ scale wind tunnel at the Langley Research Center , and it was discovered that the Aerocycle 's forwards speed was limited by an uncontrollable pitching motion , but rotor @-@ tip clearance was always sufficient . The inability to determine the precise cause of the intermeshing , combined with the fact that the " personal lifting device " concept was failing to live up to its expectations , led to the decision to terminate the project . 
 Sundby was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his test @-@ flying work with the HZ @-@ 1 , going on to test @-@ fly the H @-@ 21 and H @-@ 34 helicopters , as well as seeing combat in the Vietnam War before retiring with the rank of colonel .

 = Tuberculosis = 
 Tuberculosis ( TB ) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) . Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs , but can also affect other parts of the body . Most infections do not have symptoms , known as latent tuberculosis . About 10 % of latent infections progress to active disease which , if left untreated , kills about half of those infected . The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood @-@ containing sputum , fever , night sweats , and weight loss . The historical term " consumption " came about due to the weight loss . Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms . 
 Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough , spit , speak , or sneeze . People with latent TB do not spread the disease . Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV / AIDS and in those who smoke . Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X @-@ rays , as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids . Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test ( <unk> ) or blood tests . 
 Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk , early detection and treatment of cases , and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette @-@ Guérin vaccine . Those at high risk include household , workplace , and social contacts of people with active TB . Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time . Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug @-@ resistant tuberculosis ( MDR @-@ TB ) . 
 One @-@ third of the world 's population is thought to be infected with TB . New infections occur in about 1 % of the population each year . In 2014 , there were 9 @.@ 6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1 @.@ 5 million deaths . More than 95 % of deaths occurred in developing countries . The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000 . About 80 % of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5 – 10 % of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test . Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body , but most commonly occurs in the lungs ( known as pulmonary tuberculosis ) . Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs , although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB . 
 General signs and symptoms include fever , chills , night sweats , loss of appetite , weight loss , and fatigue . Significant nail clubbing may also occur . 
 = = = Pulmonary = = = 
 If a tuberculosis infection does become active , it most commonly involves the lungs ( in about 90 % of cases ) . Symptoms may include chest pain and a prolonged cough producing sputum . About 25 % of people may not have any symptoms ( i.e. they remain " asymptomatic " ) . Occasionally , people may cough up blood in small amounts , and in very rare cases , the infection may erode into the pulmonary artery or a Rasmussen 's aneurysm , resulting in massive bleeding . Tuberculosis may become a chronic illness and cause extensive scarring in the upper lobes of the lungs . The upper lung lobes are more frequently affected by tuberculosis than the lower ones . The reason for this difference is not clear . It may be due either to better air flow , or to poor lymph drainage within the upper lungs . 
 = = = Extrapulmonary = = = 
 In 15 – 20 % of active cases , the infection spreads outside the lungs , causing other kinds of TB . These are collectively denoted as " extrapulmonary tuberculosis " . Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in immunosuppressed persons and young children . In those with HIV , this occurs in more than 50 % of cases . Notable extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura ( in tuberculous pleurisy ) , the central nervous system ( in tuberculous meningitis ) , the lymphatic system ( in scrofula of the neck ) , the genitourinary system ( in urogenital tuberculosis ) , and the bones and joints ( in Pott disease of the spine ) , among others . When it spreads to the bones , it is also known as " osseous tuberculosis " , a form of osteomyelitis . Sometimes , bursting of a tubercular abscess through skin results in tuberculous ulcer . An ulcer originating from nearby infected lymph nodes is painless , slowly enlarging and has an appearance of " wash leather " . A potentially more serious , widespread form of TB is called " disseminated tuberculosis " , also known as miliary tuberculosis . <unk> TB makes up about 10 % of extrapulmonary cases . 
 = = Causes = = 
 = = = Mycobacteria = = = 
 The main cause of TB is Mycobacterium tuberculosis , a small , aerobic , <unk> bacillus . The high lipid content of this pathogen accounts for many of its unique clinical characteristics . It divides every 16 to 20 hours , which is an extremely slow rate compared with other bacteria , which usually divide in less than an hour . Mycobacteria have an outer membrane lipid bilayer . If a Gram stain is performed , MTB either stains very weakly " Gram @-@ positive " or does not retain dye as a result of the high lipid and mycolic acid content of its cell wall . MTB can withstand weak disinfectants and survive in a dry state for weeks . In nature , the bacterium can grow only within the cells of a host organism , but M. tuberculosis can be cultured in the laboratory . 
 Using histological stains on expectorated samples from phlegm ( also called " sputum " ) , scientists can identify MTB under a microscope . Since MTB retains certain stains even after being treated with acidic solution , it is classified as an acid @-@ fast bacillus . The most common acid @-@ fast staining techniques are the Ziehl – Neelsen stain and the <unk> stain , which dye acid @-@ fast bacilli a bright red that stands out against a blue background . <unk> @-@ <unk> staining and fluorescence microscopy are also used . 
 The M. tuberculosis complex ( MTBC ) includes four other TB @-@ causing mycobacteria : M. bovis , M. africanum , M. <unk> , and M. <unk> . M. africanum is not widespread , but it is a significant cause of tuberculosis in parts of Africa . M. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis , but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost completely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries . M. <unk> is rare and seems to be limited to the Horn of Africa , although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants . M. <unk> is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people , although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated . 
 Other known pathogenic mycobacteria include M. <unk> , M. avium , and M. <unk> . The latter two species are classified as " <unk> mycobacteria " ( NTM ) . NTM cause neither TB nor leprosy , but they do cause pulmonary diseases that resemble TB . 
 = = = Risk factors = = = 
 A number of factors make people more susceptible to TB infections . The most important risk factor globally is HIV ; 13 % of all people with TB are infected by the virus . This is a particular problem in sub @-@ Saharan Africa , where rates of HIV are high . Of people without HIV who are infected with tuberculosis , about 5 – 10 % develop active disease during their lifetimes ; in contrast , 30 % of those coinfected with HIV develop the active disease . 
 Tuberculosis is closely linked to both overcrowding and malnutrition , making it one of the principal diseases of poverty . Those at high risk thus include : people who inject illicit drugs , inhabitants and employees of locales where vulnerable people gather ( e.g. prisons and homeless shelters ) , medically underprivileged and resource @-@ poor communities , high @-@ risk ethnic minorities , children in close contact with high @-@ risk category patients , and health @-@ care providers serving these patients . 
 Chronic lung disease is another significant risk factor . <unk> increases the risk about 30 @-@ fold . Those who smoke cigarettes have nearly twice the risk of TB compared to nonsmokers . 
 Other disease states can also increase the risk of developing tuberculosis . These include alcoholism and diabetes mellitus ( three @-@ fold increase ) . 
 Certain medications , such as corticosteroids and infliximab ( an anti @-@ <unk> monoclonal antibody ) , are becoming increasingly important risk factors , especially in the developed world . 
 Genetic susceptibility also exists , for which the overall importance remains undefined . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 = = = Transmission = = = 
 When people with active pulmonary TB cough , sneeze , speak , sing , or spit , they expel infectious aerosol droplets 0 @.@ 5 to 5 @.@ 0 µm in diameter . A single sneeze can release up to 40 @,@ 000 droplets . Each one of these droplets may transmit the disease , since the infectious dose of tuberculosis is very small ( the inhalation of fewer than 10 bacteria may cause an infection ) . 
 People with prolonged , frequent , or close contact with people with TB are at particularly high risk of becoming infected , with an estimated 22 % infection rate . A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10 – 15 ( or more ) other people per year . Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious . The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors , including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier , the effectiveness of ventilation , the duration of exposure , the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain , the level of immunity in the uninfected person , and others . The cascade of person @-@ to @-@ person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ( " overt " ) TB and putting them on anti @-@ TB drug regimens . After about two weeks of effective treatment , subjects with <unk> active infections generally do not remain contagious to others . If someone does become infected , it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others . 
 = = = Pathogenesis = = = 
 About 90 % of those infected with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic , latent TB infections ( sometimes called <unk> ) , with only a 10 % lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt , active tuberculous disease . In those with HIV , the risk of developing active TB increases to nearly 10 % a year . If effective treatment is not given , the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66 % . 
 TB infection begins when the mycobacteria reach the pulmonary alveoli , where they invade and replicate within endosomes of alveolar macrophages . Macrophages identify the bacterium as foreign and attempt to eliminate it by phagocytosis . During this process , the bacterium is enveloped by the macrophage and stored temporarily in a membrane @-@ bound vesicle called a phagosome . The phagosome then combines with a lysosome to create a phagolysosome . In the phagolysosome , the cell attempts to use reactive oxygen species and acid to kill the bacterium . However , M. tuberculosis has a thick , waxy mycolic acid capsule that protects it from these toxic substances . M. tuberculosis is able to reproduce inside the macrophage and will eventually kill the immune cell . 
 The primary site of infection in the lungs , known as the " <unk> focus " , is generally located in either the upper part of the lower lobe , or the lower part of the upper lobe . Tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur via infection from the blood stream . This is known as a Simon focus and is typically found in the top of the lung . This <unk> transmission can also spread infection to more distant sites , such as peripheral lymph nodes , the kidneys , the brain , and the bones . All parts of the body can be affected by the disease , though for unknown reasons it rarely affects the heart , skeletal muscles , pancreas , or thyroid . 
 Tuberculosis is classified as one of the granulomatous inflammatory diseases . Macrophages , T lymphocytes , B lymphocytes , and fibroblasts aggregate to form granulomas , with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages . When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage , they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen . The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system . However , more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host 's immune system . Macrophages and dendritic cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes ; thus the immune response is suppressed . Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant , resulting in latent infection . Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death ( necrosis ) in the center of tubercles . To the naked eye , this has the texture of soft , white cheese and is termed <unk> necrosis . 
 If TB bacteria gain entry to the blood stream from an area of damaged tissue , they can spread throughout the body and set up many foci of infection , all appearing as tiny , white tubercles in the tissues . This severe form of TB disease , most common in young children and those with HIV , is called miliary tuberculosis . People with this disseminated TB have a high fatality rate even with treatment ( about 30 % ) . 
 In many people , the infection waxes and wanes . Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis . Affected tissue is replaced by scarring and cavities filled with <unk> necrotic material . During active disease , some of these cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up . It contains living bacteria , so can spread the infection . Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place . Upon cure , affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 = = = Active tuberculosis = = = 
 Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult , as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed . A diagnosis of TB should , however , be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks . A chest X @-@ ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid @-@ fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation . Interferon @-@ γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world . IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV . 
 A definitive diagnosis of TB is made by identifying M. tuberculosis in a clinical sample ( e.g. , sputum , pus , or a tissue biopsy ) . However , the difficult culture process for this slow @-@ growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture . Thus , treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed . 
 Nucleic acid amplification tests and adenosine deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB . These tests , however , are not routinely recommended , as they rarely alter how a person is treated . Blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive , so they are not recommended . 
 = = = Latent tuberculosis = = = 
 The <unk> tuberculin skin test is often used to screen people at high risk for TB . Those who have been previously immunized may have a false @-@ positive test result . The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis , Hodgkin 's lymphoma , malnutrition , and most notably , active tuberculosis . Interferon gamma release assays ( <unk> ) , on a blood sample , are recommended in those who are positive to the <unk> test . These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria , so they generate fewer false @-@ positive results . However , they are affected by M. <unk> , M. <unk> , and M. <unk> . <unk> may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test , but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases . The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens , and a small decrease in case numbers . 
 = = = Vaccines = = = 
 The only available vaccine as of 2011 is Bacillus Calmette @-@ Guérin ( BCG ) . In children it decreases the risk of getting the infection by 20 % and the risk of infection turning into disease by nearly 60 % . 
 It is the most widely used vaccine worldwide , with more than 90 % of all children being vaccinated . The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years . As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada , the United Kingdom , and the United States , BCG is administered only to those people at high risk . Part of the reasoning against the use of the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive , reducing the test 's use in screening . A number of new vaccines are currently in development . 
 = = = Public health = = = 
 The World Health Organization declared TB a " global health emergency " in 1993 , and in 2006 , the Stop TB Partnership developed a Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis that aims to save 14 million lives between its launch and 2015 . A number of targets they have set are not likely to be achieved by 2015 , mostly due to the increase in HIV @-@ associated tuberculosis and the emergence of multiple drug @-@ resistant tuberculosis . A tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is used primarily in public health programs . 
 = = Management = = 
 Treatment of TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria . Effective TB treatment is difficult , due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the <unk> cell wall , which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective . The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin , and treatments can be prolonged , taking several months . Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic , while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance . People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life . Directly observed therapy , i.e. , having a health care provider watch the person take their medications , is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics . The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is poor . Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment do , however , appear effective . 
 = = = New onset = = = 
 The recommended treatment of new @-@ onset pulmonary tuberculosis , as of 2010 , is six months of a combination of antibiotics containing rifampicin , isoniazid , <unk> , and <unk> for the first two months , and only rifampicin and isoniazid for the last four months . Where resistance to isoniazid is high , <unk> may be added for the last four months as an alternative . 
 = = = Recurrent disease = = = 
 If tuberculosis recurs , testing to determine to which antibiotics it is sensitive is important before determining treatment . If multiple drug @-@ resistant TB is detected , treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24 months is recommended . 
 = = = Medication resistance = = = 
 Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB . A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary ( acquired ) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment , not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately ( lack of compliance ) , or using low @-@ quality medication . Drug @-@ resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries , as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs . MDR @-@ TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first @-@ line TB drugs : rifampicin and isoniazid . Extensively drug @-@ resistant TB is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second @-@ line drugs . Totally drug @-@ resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs . It was first observed in 2003 in Italy , but not widely reported until 2012 , and has also been found in Iran and India . <unk> is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug @-@ resistant TB . 
 XDR @-@ TB is a term sometimes used to define extensively resistant TB , and constitutes one in ten cases of MDR @-@ TB . Cases of XDR TB have been identified in more than 90 % of countries . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Progression from TB infection to overt TB disease occurs when the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply . In primary TB disease ( some 1 – 5 % of cases ) , this occurs soon after the initial infection . However , in the majority of cases , a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms . These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5 – 10 % of these latent cases , often many years after infection . 
 The risk of reactivation increases with immunosuppression , such as that caused by infection with HIV . In people coinfected with M. tuberculosis and HIV , the risk of reactivation increases to 10 % per year . Studies using DNA fingerprinting of M. tuberculosis strains have shown reinfection contributes more substantially to recurrent TB than previously thought , with estimates that it might account for more than 50 % of reactivated cases in areas where TB is common . The chance of death from a case of tuberculosis is about 4 % as of 2008 , down from 8 % in 1995 . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Roughly one @-@ third of the world 's population has been infected with M. tuberculosis , with new infections occurring in about 1 % of the population each year . However , most infections with M. tuberculosis do not cause TB disease , and 90 – 95 % of infections remain asymptomatic . In 2012 , an estimated 8 @.@ 6 million chronic cases were active . In 2010 , 8 @.@ 8 million new cases of TB were diagnosed , and 1 @.@ 20 – 1 @.@ 45 million deaths occurred , most of these occurring in developing countries . Of these 1 @.@ 45 million deaths , about 0 @.@ 35 million occur in those also infected with HIV . 
 Tuberculosis is the second @-@ most common cause of death from infectious disease ( after those due to HIV / AIDS ) . The total number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2005 , while new cases have decreased since 2002 . China has achieved particularly dramatic progress , with about an 80 % reduction in its TB mortality rate between 1990 and 2010 . The number of new cases has declined by 17 % between 2004 – 2014 . Tuberculosis is more common in developing countries ; about 80 % of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive in tuberculin tests , while only 5 – 10 % of the US population test positive . Hopes of totally controlling the disease have been dramatically dampened because of a number of factors , including the difficulty of developing an effective vaccine , the expensive and time @-@ consuming diagnostic process , the necessity of many months of treatment , the increase in HIV @-@ associated tuberculosis , and the emergence of drug @-@ resistant cases in the 1980s . 
 In 2007 , the country with the highest estimated incidence rate of TB was Swaziland , with 1 @,@ 200 cases per 100 @,@ 000 people . India had the largest total incidence , with an estimated 2 @.@ 0 million new cases . In developed countries , tuberculosis is less common and is found mainly in urban areas . Rates per 100 @,@ 000 people in different areas of the world were : globally 178 , Africa 332 , the Americas 36 , Eastern Mediterranean 173 , Europe 63 , Southeast Asia 278 , and Western Pacific 139 in 2010 . In Canada and Australia , tuberculosis is many times more common among the aboriginal peoples , especially in remote areas . In the United States Native Americans have a fivefold greater mortality from TB , and racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 84 % of all reported TB cases . 
 The rates of TB varies with age . In Africa , it primarily affects adolescents and young adults . However , in countries where incidence rates have declined dramatically ( such as the United States ) , TB is mainly a disease of older people and the immunocompromised ( risk factors are listed above ) . Worldwide , 22 " high @-@ burden " states or countries together experience 80 % of cases as well as 83 % of deaths . 
 = = History = = 
 Tuberculosis has been present in humans since antiquity . The earliest unambiguous detection of M. tuberculosis involves evidence of the disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17 @,@ 000 years ago . However , whether tuberculosis originated in bovines , then was transferred to humans , or whether it diverged from a common ancestor , is currently unclear . A comparison of the genes of M. tuberculosis complex ( MTBC ) in humans to MTBC in animals suggests humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication , as was previously believed . Both strains of the tuberculosis bacteria share a common ancestor , which could have infected humans even before the Neolithic Revolution . 
 Skeletal remains show prehistoric humans ( 4000 BC ) had TB , and researchers have found tubercular decay in the spines of Egyptian mummies dating from 3000 – 2400 BC . Genetic studies suggest TB was present in the Americas from about 100 AD . 
 Before the Industrial Revolution , folklore often associated tuberculosis with vampires . When one member of a family died from it , the other infected members would lose their health slowly . People believed this was caused by the original person with TB draining the life from the other family members . 
 Although the pulmonary form associated with tubercles was established as a pathology by Dr Richard Morton in 1689 , due to the variety of its symptoms , TB was not identified as a single disease until the 1820s . It was not named " tuberculosis " until 1839 , by J. L. Schönlein . 
 During 1838 – 1845 , Dr. John Croghan , the owner of Mammoth Cave , brought a number of people with tuberculosis into the cave in the hope of curing the disease with the constant temperature and purity of the cave air ; they died within a year . Hermann <unk> opened the first TB sanatorium in 1859 in <unk> ( now <unk> ) , Silesia . 
 The bacillus causing tuberculosis , M. tuberculosis , was identified and described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch . He received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1905 for this discovery . Koch did not believe the bovine ( cattle ) and human tuberculosis diseases were similar , which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection . Later , the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced by the invention of the pasteurization process . Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a " remedy " for tuberculosis in 1890 , calling it " tuberculin " . While it was not effective , it was later successfully adapted as a screening test for the presence of pre @-@ symptomatic tuberculosis . The World Tuberculosis Day was established on 24 March for this reason . 
 Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin achieved the first genuine success in immunization against tuberculosis in 1906 , using attenuated bovine @-@ strain tuberculosis . It was called <unk> Calmette – Guérin ( BCG ) . The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France , but received widespread acceptance in the US , Great Britain , and Germany only after World War II . 
 Tuberculosis caused the most widespread public concern in the 19th and early 20th centuries as an endemic disease of the urban poor . In 1815 , one in four deaths in England was due to " consumption " . By 1918 , one in six deaths in France was still caused by TB . After TB was determined to be contagious , in the 1880s , it was put on a notifiable disease list in Britain ; campaigns were started to stop people from spitting in public places , and the infected poor were " encouraged " to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons ( the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention ) . Whatever the ( purported ) benefits of the " fresh air " and labor in the sanatoria , even under the best conditions , 50 % of those who entered died within five years ( circa 1916 ) . 
 In Europe , rates of tuberculosis began to rise in the early 1600s to a peak level in the 1800s , when it caused nearly 25 % of all deaths . By the 1950s , mortality had decreased nearly 90 % . Improvements in public health began significantly reducing rates of tuberculosis even before the arrival of streptomycin and other antibiotics , although the disease remained a significant threat to public health such that when the Medical Research Council was formed in Britain in 1913 , its initial focus was tuberculosis research . 
 In 1946 , the development of the antibiotic streptomycin made effective treatment and cure of TB a reality . Prior to the introduction of this drug , the only treatment ( except sanatoria ) was surgical intervention , including the " pneumothorax technique " , which involved collapsing an infected lung to " rest " it and allow tuberculous lesions to heal . 
 Because of the emergence of MDR @-@ TB , surgery has been re @-@ introduced as an option within the generally accepted standard of care in treating TB infections . Current surgical interventions involve removal of pathological chest cavities ( " bullae " ) in the lungs to reduce the number of bacteria and to increase the exposure of the remaining bacteria to drugs in the bloodstream , thereby simultaneously reducing the total bacterial load and increasing the effectiveness of systemic antibiotic therapy . 
 Hopes of completely eliminating TB ( cf. smallpox ) from the population were dashed after the rise of drug @-@ resistant strains in the 1980s . The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993 .

 The World Health Organization , Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , and US government are subsidizing a fast @-@ acting diagnostic tuberculosis test for use in low- and middle @-@ income countries . In addition to being fast @-@ acting , the test can determine if there is resistance to the antibiotic rifampicin which may indicate multi @-@ drug resistant tuberculosis and is accurate in those who are also infected with HIV . Many resource @-@ poor places as of 2011 have access to only sputum microscopy . 
 India had the highest total number of TB cases worldwide in 2010 , in part due to poor disease management within the private and public health care sector . Programs such as the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program are working to reduce TB levels amongst people receiving public health care . 
 A 2014 the EIU @-@ healthcare report that the need to address apathy and urging for increased funding . The report cites among others <unk> <unk> " [ TB ] is like an orphan . It has been neglected even in countries with a high burden and often forgotten by donors and those investing in health interventions . " 
 Slow progress has led to frustration , expressed by the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria – Mark <unk> : " we have the tools to end TB as a pandemic and public health threat on the planet , but we are not doing it . " Several international organizations are pushing for more transparency in treatment , and more countries are implementing mandatory reporting of cases to the government , although adherence is often sketchy . Commercial treatment providers may at times <unk> second @-@ line drugs as well as supplementary treatment , promoting demands for further regulations . The government of Brazil provides universal TB @-@ care , which reduces this problem . Conversely , falling rates of TB @-@ infection may not relate to the number of programs directed at reducing infection rates , but may be tied to increased level of education , income , and health of the population . Costs of the disease , as calculated by the World Bank in 2009 may exceed 150 billion USD per year in " high burden " countries . Lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow @-@ up – as among the <unk> rural migrants in China . 
 = = = Stigma = = = 
 Slow progress in preventing the disease may in part be due to stigma associated with TB . Stigma may be due to the fear of transmission from affected individuals . This stigma may additionally arise due to links between TB and poverty , and in Africa , AIDS . Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived , for example ; in Ghana individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings . 
 Stigma towards TB may result in delays in seeking treatment , lower treatment compliance , and family members keeping cause of death secret – allowing the disease to spread further . At odds is Russia , where stigma was associated with increased treatment compliance . TB stigma also affects socially marginalized individuals to a greater degree and varies between regions . 
 One way to decrease stigma may be through the promotion of " TB clubs " , where those infected may share experiences and offer support , or through counseling . Some studies have shown TB education programs to be effective in decreasing stigma , and may thus be effective in increasing treatment adherence . Despite this , studies on the relationship between reduced stigma and mortality are lacking as of 2010 , and similar efforts to decrease stigma surrounding AIDS have been minimally effective . Some have claimed the stigma to be worse than the disease , and healthcare providers may unintentionally reinforce stigma , as those with TB are often perceived as difficult or otherwise undesirable . A greater understanding of the social and cultural dimensions of tuberculosis may also help with stigma reduction . 
 = = Research = = 
 The BCG vaccine has limitations , and research to develop new TB vaccines is ongoing . A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials . Two main approaches are being used to attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines . One approach involves adding a subunit vaccine to BCG , while the other strategy is attempting to create new and better live vaccines . <unk> , an example of a subunit vaccine , currently in trials in South Africa , is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus . Vaccines are hoped to play a significant role in treatment of both latent and active disease . 
 To encourage further discovery , researchers and policymakers are promoting new economic models of vaccine development , including prizes , tax incentives , and advance market commitments . A number of groups , including the Stop TB Partnership , the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative , and the <unk> Global TB Vaccine Foundation , are involved with research . Among these , the <unk> Global TB Vaccine Foundation received a gift of more than $ 280 million ( US ) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and license an improved vaccine against tuberculosis for use in high burden countries . 
 A number of medications are being studied for multi drug resistant tuberculosis including : bedaquiline and <unk> . <unk> received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval in late 2012 . The safety and effectiveness of these new agents are still uncertain , because they are based on the results of a relatively small studies . However , existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug , which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians ' support for its use 
 = = Other animals = = 
 Mycobacteria infect many different animals , including birds , rodents , and reptiles . The subspecies Mycobacterium tuberculosis , though , is rarely present in wild animals . An effort to eradicate bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis from the cattle and deer herds of New Zealand has been relatively successful . Efforts in Great Britain have been less successful . 
 As of 2015 , tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive elephants in the US . It is believed that the animals originally acquired the disease from humans , a process called reverse zoonosis . Because the disease can spread through the air to infect both humans and other animals , it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos .

 " P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thing ) " is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson . It is the sixth single from Jackson 's sixth solo album , Thriller ( 1982 ) . The original demo version of the song was written by Jackson and Greg Phillinganes . Quincy Jones passed on the song itself but liked the title and , with James Ingram , fashioned a totally new song with that title . The demo version is featured on The Ultimate Collection . 
 " P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thing ) " was released on September 19 , 1983 , as the penultimate single from Thriller . The single charted at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and no . 46 on the Hot Black Singles chart , becoming the sixth Top 10 hit from the album . In the UK , the song reached a peak position of 11 . The single was most successful in Belgium , charting within the Top 10 at no . 6 . The song has been covered and sampled by numerous artists , including Monica , Justin Guarini and Kanye West . The original demo was also remixed by The Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am for Thriller 25 . 
 " P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thing ) " was never performed live by Jackson . In a rehearsal for the Dangerous World Tour , however , Jackson sang a small part of the demo version , describing it as " something I wrote that I haven 't recorded yet . "

" He noted how Jones would fall asleep on the board , waking up to answer a question . " He works in the Alpha state a lot " , Ingram added .

 = Steve Lukather = 
 Steven Lee Lukather ( born October 21 , 1957 ) is an American guitarist , singer , songwriter , arranger and record producer , best known for his work with the rock band Toto . A prolific session musician , Lukather has recorded guitar tracks for more than 1 @,@ 500 albums representing a broad array of artists and genres . He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter , arranger and producer . Lukather has released seven solo albums , the latest of which , Transition , was released in January 2013 . 
 In 1976 , when Lukather was nineteen years old , he was invited by his high school friends David Paich and the Porcaro brothers Steve and Jeff to join them in forming their band , Toto . He has been a member of the band ever since it began , and is still fully contributing to their album composition and touring . Lukather 's reputation as a guitarist and his association with Paich and Jeff Porcaro , who also became established artists , allowed him to secure a solid flow of session work in the 1970s and 1980s . Lukather has been nominated for twelve Grammy Awards , and has won five . While his work with Toto was predominantly based on pop rock music and his solo work ventures into progressive rock and hard rock , many of Lukather 's side @-@ projects are focused on jazz fusion . He held a long @-@ time collaboration with jazz guitarist Larry Carlton that produced a Grammy @-@ winning live album , and he was a member of the jazz fusion band Los Lobotomys , a collaboration of notable session musicians . 
 Influenced by such blues @-@ rock guitarists as Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page , and such jazz fusion players as Al Di Meola and Frank Gambale , Lukather is known for a " melodic and intense " playing style . He is also recognized for his efficiency in the studio , often recording tracks in one take using minimal sound processing . While he once used many guitar effects in the studio and on stage , he now frequently disparages such practice , and instead advocates clean tones and minimal studio processing . Lukather plays primarily a signature electric guitar manufactured by Ernie Ball Music Man bearing his nickname , Luke . He also plays Yamaha and Ovation <unk> series acoustic – electric guitars . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Steven Lee Lukather was born on October 21 , 1957 , in San Fernando Valley , California . In an interview with online publication <unk> ! he said : " I had a music teacher in Grammar school that made me play the violin . It was 1965 . I had been playing guitar for a year , ( after the Beatles changed our lives ) and they had NO use for a guitar player . " He then played keyboards and drums , and then taught himself how to play the guitar starting at age seven , when his father bought him a Kay acoustic guitar and a copy of the Beatles album Meet the Beatles . Lukather has said that the album " changed his life " and that he was greatly influenced by the guitar playing of George Harrison in particular . 
 In high school , Lukather met David Paich and the Porcaro brothers ( Jeff , Steve , and Mike ) , all of whom eventually became members of Toto . Lukather , who had been a self @-@ taught musician , began taking guitar lessons from Jimmy <unk> . With <unk> , Lukather expanded his knowledge of wider aspects of music , including orchestration . It was during this period in the early 1970s that Lukather became interested in the idea of becoming a session musician , a vocation that provided opportunities to play with a variety of famous musicians . 
 Jeff Porcaro , who had been playing drums with Steely Dan since 1973 , became a mentor to Lukather and furthered his interest in session work . Lukather 's first job in the music industry was studio work with Boz Scaggs , after which Paich and Jeff Porcaro — who had become prominent session musicians in their own right — asked Lukather to join them in forming Toto in 1976 along with Bobby Kimball , David <unk> , and Steve Porcaro . 
 = = = Toto = = = 
 Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto , serving in that capacity for the band 's entire history , as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer . Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto , twice as an artist and once as a producer . David Paich led the band 's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978 's Toto — he penned all but two of the album 's tracks , including all four of its singles . Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period . However , Lukather 's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band . He contributed songwriting to Toto albums starting with the eponymous lead track on 1979 's Hydra . Miles Davis was featured on the song Don 't Stop Me Now , the last track of 1986 's Fahrenheit album . After the session , he invited Lukather to join his band , but Lukather was already committed to the upcoming Toto tour . In August 1992 , Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure . The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular , who considered Porcaro a mentor . Lukather felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going . Thus , he began taking more of a leadership role . 
 Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years , including Kimball , Fergie Frederiksen , and Joseph Williams . After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist , Jean @-@ Michel Byron , Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997 ; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time . He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992 's Kingdom of Desire and 1995 's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks . The Tambu single " I Will Remember " , co @-@ written by Lukather and Stan Lynch , reached number 64 on UK charts . Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather 's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams ( and indeed , heavily criticized the entire album ) , some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs , and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band 's live shows during that period . It was not until Toto brought back former lead singers Joseph Williams and Bobby Kimball to collaborate on 1998 's Toto XX that Lukather returned to predominantly backup vocals . 
 Lukather 's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to almost every track starting in the late 1980s . He wrote very few of Toto 's songs by himself , an exception being the hit single " I Won 't Hold You Back " from Toto IV . Lukather has said that writing lyrics is not one of his strengths . Thus , he collaborated with other band members to complete song ideas and make them into viable album tracks . Lukather contributed to all of the songs on Toto 's 2006 album Falling in Between . 
 By 2008 , Lukather was the only remaining original Toto member still performing with the band ( Kimball was also in the band at the time , but had earlier been absent from it for a long period of time , whereas Lukather has been with Toto since its formation ) . In June of the same year , Lukather decided to leave Toto . This decision directly led to the official dissolution of the band . In a 2011 interview discussing his career with Toto , Lukather indicated that the band had evolved too far from its original incarnation and that he was dealing with the physical and mental toll of recording and performing . In February 2010 , the band announced that they would reunite to support Toto bassist Mike Porcaro , who was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig 's disease . They continued to tour on a limited basis in 2011 and 2012 . 
 Although Lukather indicated in April 2011 that the band would not record any further material , Toto announced a heavy international tour schedule and new studio album in March 2014 . In March 2015 Toto XIV was released . 
 = = = Session work = = = 
 Lukather achieved notability in the 1970s and 1980s as one of the most sought @-@ after session guitarists in Los Angeles , playing with a wide range of artists from Aretha Franklin to Warren Zevon . He has performed on over 1 @,@ 500 records spanning 36 years . Music journalist Jude Gold noted , " It 's hard to name a guitarist who has had a more prolific and fulfilling career than Steve Lukather . " Lukather credits fellow Toto members David Paich and Jeff Porcaro for getting him exposure in the industry — although he lamented in an April 2011 interview that opportunities for session musicians have curtailed in recent years : " There is no ' session guy ' thing any more — not like it was . It 's not like the old days when I was doing 25 sessions a week . All the studios are gone . The budgets are gone . The record companies are all gone . " His own output as a session musician has slowed along with the rest of the industry — as of 2009 , Lukather stated he was only doing a few sessions a year . 
 Named by Gibson Guitar Corporation as one of the top 10 session guitarists of all time , Lukather has performed on many notable tracks . He performed the guitar solo for Olivia Newton @-@ John 's popular 1981 single " Physical " , which was Billboard 's number 1 single of the 1980s . Other notable session performances include Earth , Wind & Fire 's Faces album soloing on the tracks " Back On the Road " and " You Went Away " , Michael Jackson 's " Beat It " , two tracks from the Lionel Richie album Can 't Slow Down , and the Richard Marx album Repeat Offender . Lukather and Jeff Porcaro were heavily involved in the recording of virtually all of Michael Jackson 's Thriller . In addition to recording guitar tracks , Lukather has also written or produced music for Lionel Richie , Richard Marx , Chicago , Donna Summer , and The Tubes . He won a Grammy award in 1982 for the George Benson song " Turn Your Love Around " . 
 = = = Solo albums = = = 
 Lukather has released six solo studio albums : Lukather ( 1989 ) , Candyman ( 1994 ) , Luke ( 1997 ) , Santamental ( 2003 ) , Ever Changing Times ( 2008 ) , and All 's Well That Ends Well ( 2010 ) . In December 2011 , he began work on his seventh , Transition , a collaboration with C. J. Vanston featuring musicians Chad Smith , Gregg Bissonette , Leland Sklar , and others . The album was released January 21 , 2013 . 
 = = = = 1989 – 1997 : Lukather , Candyman , and Luke = = = = 
 The 1989 album Lukather came about after Toto had been recording and playing for 11 years , and the consensus among the band members was to take a break . As Lukather had written a number of songs that did not appear on Toto albums , he decided to pursue a solo album , with the intention of presenting a dimension of his music that fans would be unfamiliar with . He collaborated with many notable musicians , including Eddie Van Halen , Richard Marx , Jan Hammer , Steve Stevens , and fellow Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich . Lukather has said that the album was produced very simply , and that a lot of ambient studio noise — counting off on various tracks , for instance — is audible on it . He also credits bands Pink Floyd , Cream , Led Zeppelin , and guitarists Jimi Hendrix , David Gilmour , Jeff Beck , and Eric Clapton as influences on the album . The single " Swear Your Love " came from the album . 
 Candyman , recorded and mastered from March 1993 through November 1993 , was a collaboration of musicians who were for the most part also in Lukather 's band Los Lobotomys . Toto familiars Simon Phillips and David Paich participated as well as David Garfield , John Peña , Chris Trujillo , Lenny Castro , Larry Klimas , Fee Waybill , Richard Page , and Paul Rodgers . Lukather recorded the album in mostly live takes with little overdubbing . Some international fans were confused about whether Candyman was a Steve Lukather album or a Los Lobotomys album . The Japanese and US releases of Candyman were under the Los Lobotomys name rather than Lukather 's ; the Japanese release also featured a version of the Hendrix song " Red House " . The European release of Candyman was credited to Lukather alone . Additionally , the touring band for the album was sometimes introduced as " Steve Lukather and Los Lobotomys " and sometimes as just " Los Lobotomys " . The song " Borrowed Time " was released as a single in Europe and included " Red House " as a B @-@ side . 
 Lukather describes 1997 's Luke as a much different and more " introspective " album than his previous two solo efforts . The album is a concentrated collection of many of Lukather 's musical influences , and he deliberately let those influences come out on the album . Luke is an experimental album , and like Candyman it was recorded mostly in live sessions with minimal overdubbing and processing afterwards . Luke also features instrumentation not heard on previous Lukather albums : pedal steel , harmonicas , Mellotrons , and experimental guitar , bass , and drum sounds . The US version of Luke includes a version of the Jeff Beck song " The Pump " . The song " Hate Everything About U " was released as a single . 
 = = = = 2003 : Santamental = = = = 
 Santamental , released in October 2003 , is a collaborative project featuring several prominent musicians such as guitarists Eddie Van Halen , Slash , Steve Vai , and drummer Gregg Bissonette . When Lukather 's record company , Bop City Records , approached him about recording a Christmas album , he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project . The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album . Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff <unk> and guitarist Larry Carlton , who Lukather had worked with previously , to help arrange the songs . The project was a challenge to Lukather , who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures . He said of the album , " But I never dreamt in a million years that I 'd do a Christmas record . " 
 The musicians Lukather chose for Santamental , most of whom were involved in the hard @-@ rock genre , lent a heavy feel to the album . Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for " Joy to the World " after not having been in the studio for some time but immediately made an impression on Lukather with his level of playing . Vai provided guitar work for " Carol of the Bells " along with Lukather 's son Trevor , then 14 years old . Slash , who recorded his part in one take , played on the Lukather / Stan Lynch composition " Broken Heart for Christmas " . Lukather spoke highly of Slash after the project , calling him the " Keith Richards of our generation " . Well @-@ known session guitarist Michael Landau played on the song " Look Out For Angels " , and there is a version of " Jingle Bells " featuring a big band and sung by Sammy Davis , Jr . Santamental was recorded in six days , after which Lukather proclaimed it " his first and last Christmas album " . 
 = = = = 2008 – present : Ever Changing Times , All 's Well That Ends Well , and Transition = = = = 
 Ever Changing Times , released on February 22 , 2008 , is a collection of songs Lukather recorded in 2007 between Toto tours . The album contains contributions from fellow session musicians Bill Champlin , Abe Laboriel , Jr . , Leland Sklar , Steve Porcaro , and many others . Lukather 's son Trevor contributed as well . Joseph Williams provides backing vocals on five of the tracks . Lukather wrote the songs for the album in a hotel room with his son and a handful of other musicians , using basic equipment . His song @-@ writing philosophy is that if a song sounds good with only guitars and vocals , it will likely sound good after a full production . Lukather collaborated with Grammy Award @-@ winning engineer and producer Steve MacMillan on the project , with the goal of introducing some new methods and techniques into the recording process . Lukather described the final tracks as " perfectly imperfect " , preferring to record with the five @-@ piece backing band in one room and in one take . MacMillan encouraged Lukather to use " organic , vintage tones " . As a result , Lukather eschewed effects and played the guitar parts directly through tube amplifiers manufactured by Marshall , Vox , and some boutique brands . Lukather commented that MacMillan served as a valuable " second set of ears " in the studio , often encouraging him to keep parts that he normally would have discarded . As Toto had recently disbanded when Ever Changing Times was released , Lukather embarked on a solo tour to promote the album . The shows featured a mixture of songs from the album , songs written for other side projects , and " a few Toto <unk> " . 
 Lukather 's sixth studio album , All 's Well That Ends Well , was released on October 11 , 2010 , in Europe and Japan , and November 16 as a digital download worldwide . The material was written predominantly in collaboration with longtime associate C. J. Vanston , and the album features stalwart musicians from Lukather 's touring band . Songwriter Randy Goodrum , who has collaborated with Lukather many times over the years including on the 1986 Toto single " I 'll Be over You " , contributes to the track " Brody 's " . All 's Well That Ends Well draws from Lukather 's personal experiences in the two years since Ever Changing Times . Critic Arlene Weiss noted that the album features three distinct flavors of music : one that " bares [ Lukather 's ] soul and emotional heartache " , one that pans elements of popular culture like TMZ.com , and one that expresses optimism and enthusiasm about the future . While Lukather focused on instrumental writing and production on previous albums but collaborated with lyricists , he wrote much of the lyrics for All 's Well That Ends Well himself . Lukather describes the album as being a " real " and " honest " reflection of the period between 2008 and 2010 , when he experienced difficulties within his private life . 
 In December 2011 , Lukather announced the beginning of work on Transition . The album was produced with songwriter and record producer C.J. Vanston and involved musicians Chad Smith , Gregg Bissonette , Leland Sklar , Steve <unk> , and others . Throughout 2012 , Lukather released notes and news of the album development through his web site . The title was announced on October 12 , 2012 . The album was released January 21 , 2013 . 
 = = = Side projects = = = 
 When not working with Toto , Lukather has participated in numerous side projects including playing with jazz fusion band Los Lobotomys and with other session musicians , and touring with Larry Carlton , Joe Satriani , Steve Vai , and others . 
 Lukather was a long @-@ time member of the band Los Lobotomys , a collaboration of session musicians including jazz and be @-@ bop player David " <unk> " Garfield and Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro , replaced after his death by Simon Phillips , who also replaced Porcaro in Toto . Los Lobotomys formed in the mid @-@ 1980s and played regular shows in the Los Angeles area , often inviting whatever session musicians happened to be available and in the area . They recorded an album under the Los Lobotomys name in 1989 , and the band was heavily involved in the recording of Lukather 's Candyman . Los Lobotomys recorded a live album in 2004 comprising several tracks from Candyman and from the 1989 album . 
 In 1998 , Lukather received an invitation to tour Japan with fellow guitarist Larry Carlton after Japanese promoters requested that Carlton 's annual tours each be different from the last . Lukather and Carlton exchanged some recorded material and decided that a collaboration would be interesting . Lukather was flattered by the invitation to tour with Carlton , citing him as his favorite guitarist . Lukather speaks highly of their stage efforts , although the two were admittedly outside their normal realm of work . He stated in an interview that " you can hear us having fun on the record — you can hear the smiles on our faces . " After several shows , the duo realized that they should record their collaboration even if just for their own use . Guitarist and producer Steve Vai heard one of the subsequent recordings and expressed interest in releasing it under his Favored Nations label , also home to such artists as Eric Johnson and Dweezil Zappa . Vai and Lukather mixed and produced the recording , which is said to be a mixture of jazz , blues , and fusion music . The resulting album , No Substitutions : Live in Osaka , won a 2001 Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Album . Album reviewers described Lukather as having a heavier style than Carlton . Lukather and Carlton later did an international tour in support of the album . 
 In 2005 , Lukather won critical praise for his rendition of the Jimi Hendrix song " Little Wing " at a gala 90th birthday celebration for jazz guitarist Les Paul . Returning after a five @-@ year absence , the 2012 G3 Tour featured Lukather alongside Joe Satriani and Steve Vai . 
 In the autumn 2006 , Lukather contributed his cover @-@ version of the Michael Landau @-@ song " I 'm <unk> " ( originally from Landau 's Tales From The Bulge album ) from a live recording of his side band project , El Grupo , to the album project Artists for Charity – Guitarists 4 the Kids , produced by Slang Productions , to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged kids in need . 
 In February 2012 , Ringo Starr announced that Lukather would be the guitarist in his All Starr Band for their summer tour . Lukather has been touring with that ensemble since that time , performing three Toto songs ( " Hold The Line , " " Rosanna , " and " Africa " ) nightly . 
 Lukather periodically contributes material and expertise to instructional and educational enterprises . In 1985 , he released the instructional " Star Licks " guitar video featuring many of the guitar parts from the first five Toto studio albums . It was released on DVD in 2005 . The guitarist has also been participating in the <unk> Master Class Series project , an educational cooperative organized by the <unk> Music Academy in Mexico . 
 = = Musical style and equipment = = 
 Influenced by such blues @-@ rock guitarists as Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page , and such jazz fusion players as John McLaughlin , Al Di Meola and Frank Gambale , Lukather is known for a " melodic and intense " playing style . He has also cited Steely Dan as a major long @-@ time influence — one that emerges prominently in later solo work such as All 's Well That Ends Well . Journalist Jude Gold notes that his vibrato is very pronounced and his " exaggerated wide bends " are distinctive and quickly recognizable . Well @-@ versed in music theory , Lukather can follow chord charts and changes in a way typical of jazz musicians — this ability enhances his value as a session musician . In interviews , he has explained how he thinks of the guitar in a " chordal cluster " format , and not the typical " linear scale " format . 
 Lukather 's approach to engineering his sound in the studio is usually simple . He is not known for doing a large number of takes or for incorporating much overdubbing — rather , he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts . He has said about this approach : " If a solo didn 't work — either because I didn 't have the right sound , or because I wasn 't inspired at that moment — I 'd just move on . A part either works or it doesn 't . You can 't batter it into submission , or force inspiration to save you . It 's always better to just surrender , and then come back later to give it a go with fresh ears . " Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio , Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage . He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality . 
 Despite being known in the past for having an intricate set of effects units , Lukather now says he plays mostly free of such modifications after seeing some overdone commercial unit configurations named after him . Other than some delay , he has not used many effects in recent years . He has held a long association with Bob Bradshaw of Custom Audio Electronics , who designed and manufactured key elements of Lukather 's effects rack . Lukather was one of the few official endorsers of EMG pickups , having collaborated on his own Lukather signature " <unk> " pickup system , which is a single unit incorporating two single coils and an EMG 85 humbucker . The system has a single volume and tone knob , and a pickguard . In December 2012 , Lukather collaborated with DiMarzio pickups on a new set of signature pickups called " Transition . " He has been using these pickups in his Music @-@ Man Luke 3 guitar . 
 Lukather endorses Music Man guitars and has a signature model named " Luke " that incorporates his signature EMG pickup system . The guitar started out with only <unk> specifications ( including a Floyd Rose locking vibrato , later replaced with a vintage @-@ style fulcrum bridge ) , but in 1998 , the manufacturer made several customizations to the model to better fit Lukather 's playing style . Music Man also produces a Ball Family Reserve Steve Lukather Model that features an alder body with a mahogany " tone block " inlaid under the pickups , capped with a figured maple top and transparent finish . In 2012 a new version of the guitar called the <unk> was introduced with a 3 % larger but similarly contoured body , all @-@ rosewood neck and passive pickup options ( dual humbucker or single single humbucker ) combined with an active preamp and 12 db boost activated from a push / push tone pot . In 2013 Lukather changed to a roasted maple neck with a rosewood fret board , citing the exceptional stability of roasted maple while touring as a factor in his decision . As a result , the <unk> specification and production was changed to match Lukather 's preference . Lukather has also been known to play Ibanez and Valley Arts guitars . His relationship with Ibanez and Valley Arts yielded an endorsement for a brief time in the 1980s with the release of the Ibanez <unk> <unk> and Valley Arts Custom Pro Steve Lukather Signature guitars in 1984 – 85 . He has played Ovation <unk> series acoustic – electric guitars . Starting before his 2010 All 's Well That Ends Well tour , Lukather began playing and endorsing Yamaha Studio Response Technology acoustic – electric guitars . 
 Information about his current rig can be found on Lukather 's website which is kept up to date .

It said , " if you ever watched an episode of ' The Suite Life with Zack & Cody ' you should realize that show is watchable because of one character : London Tipton .

" While commenting on Song , MSN 's 2009 cover story on the series stated , " Song is one of the main reasons why the " Suite Life " franchise remains one of the most successful and highly rated series in the Disney stable . " In a 2009 People magazine article , the character was described as a " melodramatic high @-@ seas diva . "

 Song 's first starring role as the title character was in the 2006 Disney Channel Original Movie Wendy Wu : Homecoming Warrior , which had over 5 @.@ 7 million viewers at its premiere . Wendy Wu was planned to be a comedy , but the directors of the film were having trouble finding a suitable actor with both the comedic presence and taekwondo ability to play the main character , originally named Kenny Lu . Lydia Cook , one of the films 's directors , said , " Brenda was originally brought in to play the [ supporting ] monk 's role . We started training with her in martial arts , and that 's when we realized that she should be Kenny Lu . They quickly switched things around and offered Brenda the lead in the movie . She had the perfect combination of wit and martial arts . " Song had to break a brick with her hand in a screen test before landing the title role . 
 According to The New York Times , the film became a " star vehicle " for Song . The film was about an average , popular Chinese @-@ American teenager whose life is turned upside down by a visit from a young Chinese monk ( Shin Koyamada ) . The monk claims she is the reincarnation of a powerful female warrior and the only person who can prevent an ancient evil spirit from destroying the world . In a second story line , Wendy and most of her family struggle with keeping their culture and heritage . Song felt she could relate to the message since she knew little about her own people before making the film .

" The site praised the film , stating , " Wendy Wu : Homecoming Warrior is an enjoyable little telefilm , rife with killer action sequences ( for a <unk> ) , and a great showcase of talent in both acting and martial for Brenda Song . Aside from a few totally cliched characters and situations , it 's worth 91 minutes of your time . " Allmovie described Song as a " charming and appealing personality , even when playing a shallow airhead " . 
 While commending Disney for the strong Asian cast , a <unk> review noted that that it is rare to see a female martial arts star with a black belt .

 = SMS Posen = 
 SMS Posen was one of four battleships in the Nassau class , the first dreadnoughts built for the German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) . The ship was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel on 11 June 1907 , launched on 13 December 1908 , and commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 31 May 1910 . She was equipped with a main battery of twelve 28 cm ( 11 in ) guns in six twin turrets in an unusual hexagonal arrangement . 
 The ship served with her three sister ships for the majority of World War I. She saw extensive service in the North Sea , where she took part in several fleet sorties . These culminated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 , where Posen was heavily engaged in night @-@ fighting against British light forces . In the confusion , the ship accidentally rammed the light cruiser SMS Elbing , which suffered serious damage and was scuttled later in the night . 
 The ship also conducted several deployments to the Baltic Sea against the Russian Navy . In the first of these , Posen supported a German naval assault in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga . The ship was sent back to the Baltic in 1918 to support the White Finns in the Finnish Civil War . At the end of the war , Posen remained in Germany while the majority of the fleet was interned in Scapa Flow . In 1919 , following the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow , she was ceded to the British as a replacement for the ships that had been sunk . She was then sent to ship @-@ breakers in the Netherlands and scrapped in 1922 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Posen was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz Baden , as a replacement for the Baden , one of the elderly Sachsen @-@ class ironclads . She was laid down on 11 June 1907 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel . As with her sister Nassau , construction proceeded under absolute secrecy ; detachments of soldiers guarded the shipyard and also guarded contractors that supplied building materials , such as Krupp . The ship was launched a year and a half later , on 12 December 1908 . Wilhelm August Hans von <unk> @-@ <unk> gave a speech at her launching , and Posen was christened by Johanna von <unk> , the wife of Hugo Fürst von <unk> , a German diplomat who hailed from the ship 's namesake province . Initial trials were conducted through April 1910 , followed by final fitting @-@ out in May . The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 31 May . Sea trials were conducted afterward and completed by 27 August . In total , her construction cost the German government 36 @,@ 920 @,@ 000 marks . 
 Posen was 146 @.@ 1 m ( 479 ft 4 @.@ 0 in ) long , 26 @.@ 9 m ( 88 ft 3 @.@ 1 in ) wide , and had a draft of 8 @.@ 9 m ( 29 ft 2 @.@ 4 in ) . She displaced 18 @,@ 873 t ( 18 @,@ 575 long tons ) with a standard load , and 20 @,@ 535 t ( 20 @,@ 211 long tons ) fully laden . The ship had a crew of 40 officers and 968 enlisted men . Posen retained three @-@ shafted triple expansion engines with coal @-@ fired boilers instead of more advanced turbine engines . Her propulsion system was rated at 28 @,@ 000 PS ( 27 @,@ 617 ihp ; 20 @,@ 594 kW ) and provided a top speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . She had a cruising radius of 8 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 400 km ; 9 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . This type of machinery was chosen at the request of both Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz and the Navy 's construction department ; the latter stated in 1905 that the " use of turbines in heavy warships does not recommend itself . " This decision was based solely on cost : at the time , Parsons held a monopoly on steam turbines and required a 1 million gold mark royalty fee for every turbine engine . German firms were not ready to begin production of turbines on a large scale until 1910 . 
 Posen carried twelve 28 cm ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) SK L / 45 guns in an unusual hexagonal configuration . Her secondary armament consisted of twelve 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) SK L / 45 guns and sixteen 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK L / 45 guns , all of which were mounted in casemates . Later in her career , two of the 8 @.@ 8 cm guns were replaced with high @-@ angle Flak mountings of the same caliber for defense against aircraft . The ship was also armed with six 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) submerged torpedo tubes . One tube was mounted in the bow , another in the stern , and two on each broadside , on either ends of the torpedo bulkhead . The ship 's belt armor was 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) thick in the central portion of the hull , and the armored deck was 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick . The main battery turrets had 280 mm ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) thick sides , and the conning tower was protected with 400 mm ( 15 @.@ 7 in ) of armor plating . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After completing her trials in August 1910 , Posen left Kiel for Wilhelmshaven , where she arrived on 7 September . As the German Imperial Navy had chronic shortages of trained sailors , many of the crew were then assigned to other ships . These crewmembers were replaced with personnel from the old pre @-@ dreadnought Wittelsbach , which was decommissioned on 20 September . After their commissioning , all four Nassau @-@ class ships served as a unit , the II Division of I Battle Squadron , with Posen as the flagship . 
 Posen participated in several training exercises with the rest of the fleet before the outbreak of war . In late 1910 the fleet conducted a training cruise into the Baltic Sea . The following year the fleet conducted maneuvers in May ; the annual summer cruise to Norway followed in July . The fleet participated in another round of fleet exercises in the Baltic in September , followed by another set at the end of the year . The next year followed a similar pattern , though the summer cruise to Norway was interrupted by the Agadir crisis ; as a result , the summer cruise only went into the Baltic . The September exercises were conducted off Helgoland in the North Sea ; another winter cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year . The training schedule returned to normal for 1913 and 1914 , and the summer cruises again went to Norway . For the 1914 cruise , the fleet departed for Norwegian waters on 14 July , some two weeks after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo . The probability of war cut the cruise short ; Posen and the rest of the fleet were back in Wilhelmshaven by 29 July . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 At midnight on 4 August , the United Kingdom declared war on Germany . Posen and the rest of the fleet conducted several advances into the North Sea to support Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper 's I Scouting Group battlecruisers . The battlecruisers raided British coastal towns in an attempt to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet . The first such operation was the raid on Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby on 15 – 16 December 1914 . On the evening of 15 December , the German battle fleet of 12 dreadnoughts — including Posen and her three sisters — and eight pre @-@ dreadnoughts came to within 10 nmi ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) of an isolated squadron of six British battleships . Skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced the German fleet commander , Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl , that he was faced with the Grand Fleet , now deployed in its battle formation . Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily , von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battlefleet back toward Germany . 
 = = = = Battle of the Gulf of Riga = = = = 
 In August , a special unit from the German fleet attempted to clear the Russian @-@ held Gulf of Riga in order to assist the German Army , which was planning an assault on Riga . To do so , the German planners intended to drive off or destroy the Russian naval forces in the Gulf , which included the pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Slava and some smaller gunboats and destroyers . The German battle fleet was accompanied by several mine @-@ warfare vessels . These ships were tasked with clearing Russian minefields and laying a series of their own minefields in the northern entrance to the gulf , to prevent Russian naval reinforcements from reaching the area . The assembled German flotilla included Posen and her three sister ships , the four Helgoland @-@ class battleships , the battlecruisers Von der Tann , Moltke , and Seydlitz , and several pre @-@ dreadnoughts , operating under the command of von Hipper , now a Vice Admiral . The eight battleships were to provide cover for the forces engaging the Russian flotilla . The first attempt on 8 August was unsuccessful , as it had taken too long to clear the Russian minefields to allow the minelayer Deutschland to lay a minefield of her own . 
 On 16 August 1915 , Posen and Nassau led a second attempt to breach the defenses of the gulf , with Posen as Admiral Schmidt 's flagship . The two dreadnoughts were accompanied by 4 light cruisers and 31 torpedo boats . On the first day of the assault the Germans broke through the Russian forces , but two German light craft — the minesweeper T46 and the destroyer V99 — were sunk . Posen and Nassau engaged a pair of Russian gunboats , Sivuch and Korietz . Sivuch was sunk that day and Korietz was severely damaged ; the ship managed to limp away but had to be scuttled the following day . On the 17th , Posen and Nassau engaged Slava at long range ; they scored three hits on the Russian ship and forced her to return to port . By 19 August , the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf . Reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted the Germans to call off the operation the following day . Admiral Hipper later remarked , " To keep valuable ships for a considerable time in a limited area in which enemy submarines were increasingly active , with the corresponding risk of damage and loss , was to indulge in a gamble out of all proportion to the advantage to be derived from the occupation of the Gulf before the capture of Riga from the land side . " In fact , the battlecruiser Moltke had been torpedoed that morning . On 21 August , Schmidt had his flag hauled down from Posen and disbanded the special unit . 
 = = = = Return to the North Sea = = = = 
 By the end of August Posen and the rest of the High Seas Fleet had returned to their anchorages in the North Sea . The next operation conducted was a sweep into the North Sea on 11 – 12 September , though it ended without any action . Another fleet sortie followed on 23 – 24 October without encountering any British forces . On 4 March 1916 , Posen , Nassau , Westfalen , and Von der Tann steamed out to the <unk> to receive the auxiliary cruiser Möwe , which was returning from a raiding mission . 
 Another uneventful advance into the North Sea took place on 21 – 22 April . A bombardment mission followed two days later ; Posen joined the battleship support for Hipper 's battlecruisers while they attacked Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24 – 25 April . During this operation , the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a British mine and had to return to port prematurely . Due to the poor visibility , the operation was soon called off , leaving the British fleet no time to intercept the raiders . 
 = = = = Battle of Jutland = = = = 
 Admiral Reinhard Scheer , who had succeeded Admirals von Ingenohl and Hugo von Pohl as the fleet commander , immediately planned another attack on the British coast . The damage to Seydlitz and condenser trouble on several of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts delayed the plan until the end of May . The German battlefleet departed the Jade at 03 : 30 on 31 May . Posen was assigned to the II Division of the I Battle Squadron as the flagship of Rear Admiral W. Engelhardt . Posen was the first ship in the division , ahead of her three sisters . The II Division was the last unit of dreadnoughts in the fleet ; they were followed by only the elderly pre @-@ dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron . 
 Between 17 : 48 and 17 : 52 , Posen and ten other German battleships engaged the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron , though the range and poor visibility prevented effective fire . Shortly thereafter , two British destroyers — Nomad and Nestor — came under intense fire from the German line . Posen fired at Nestor with both her main battery and secondary guns . At 18 : 35 , Nestor exploded and sank under the combined fire of eight battleships . By 20 : 15 , the German fleet had faced the Grand Fleet for a second time and was forced to turn away ; in doing so , the order of the German line was reversed . Posen was now the fourth ship in the line , astern of her three sisters . 
 At around 21 : 20 , Posen and her sister ships were engaged by the battlecruisers of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron . Posen was the only ship on the I Battle Squadron to be able to make out a target , which turned out to be the battlecruisers HMS Princess Royal and Indomitable . Posen opened fire at 21 : 28 at a range of 10 @,@ 000 m ( 11 @,@ 000 yd ) ; she scored one hit on Princess Royal at 21 : 32 and straddled Indomitable several times , surrounding her with a salvo of shells , before ceasing fire at 21 : 35 . 
 At about 00 : 30 , the leading units of the German line encountered British destroyers and cruisers . A violent firefight at close range ensued ; the leading German battleships , including Posen , opened fire on several British warships . In the confusion , the light cruiser Elbing passed through the German line directly in front of Posen and was rammed . Posen was undamaged , but both of Elbing 's engine rooms were flooded and the ship came to a halt . Two and a half hours later , Elbing spotted several approaching British destroyers , and her captain gave the order to scuttle the ship . 
 Shortly before 01 : 00 , the German line engaged a flotilla of British destroyers . Posen spotted the destroyers Fortune , Porpoise , and Garland at very close range ; she opened fire on the first two ships at ranges between 800 and 1 @,@ 600 m ( 870 and 1 @,@ 750 yd ) , seriously damaging Porpoise . Fortune quickly sank under fire from Posen and several other battleships , but not before firing two torpedoes which Posen had to evade . At 01 : 25 , Westfalen illuminated the destroyer Ardent and opened fire ; Posen joined her shortly thereafter and reported several hits at ranges of 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 200 m ( 1 @,@ 100 to 1 @,@ 300 yd ) . 
 Despite the ferocity of the night fighting , the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 04 : 00 on 1 June . The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later , where Posen and several other battleships from the I Battle Squadron took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead . Over the course of the battle , the ship had fired fifty @-@ three 28 cm shells , sixty @-@ four 15 cm rounds , and thirty @-@ two 8 @.@ 8 cm shells . The ship and her crew emerged from the battle completely unscathed by enemy fire . 
 Beginning in June 1917 , Wilhelm von Krosigk served as the ship 's commanding officer ; he held this position until the end of the war in November 1918 . 
 = = = = Expedition to Finland = = = = 
 In February 1918 , the German navy decided to send an expedition to Finland to support German army units to be deployed there . The Finns were engaged in a civil war ; the White Finns sought a conservative government free from the influence of the newly created Soviet Union , while the Red Guards preferred Soviet @-@ style communism . On 23 February , two of Posen 's sister ships — Westfalen and Rheinland — were assigned as the core of the Sonderverband Ostsee ( Special Unit Baltic Sea ) . The two ships embarked the 14th Jäger Battalion . They departed for the Åland Islands on the following morning . Åland was to be a forward operating base , from which the port of Hanko would be secured . From Hanko , the German expedition would assault the capital of Helsingfors . The task force reached the Åland Islands on 5 March , where they encountered the Swedish coastal defense ships HSwMS Sverige , Thor , and Oscar II . Negotiations ensued , which resulted in the landing of the German troops on Åland on 7 March ; Westfalen then returned to Danzig , where Posen was stationed . 
 On 31 March Posen and Westfalen left Danzig ; the ships arrived at Russarö , which was the outer defense for Hanko , by 3 April . The German army quickly took the port . The task force then proceeded to Helsingfors ; on 11 April the ship passed into the harbor at Helsingfors and landed the soldiers . This included a detachment from the ship which was landed two days later on 13 April . During the operation , Posen 's crew suffered four men killed and twelve wounded . From 18 to 20 April , Posen assisted with the efforts to free Rheinland , which had been grounded . Two days later , Posen struck a sunken wreck in Helsingfors harbor , which caused minor damage . On 30 April the ship was detached from the Sonderverband Ostsee . The ship returned to Germany , reaching Kiel by 3 May , where she entered drydock . Repair work lasted until 5 May . 
 = = = = Later actions in the North Sea = = = = 
 On 11 August 1918 , Posen , Westfalen , Kaiser , and Kaiserin sortied from Wilhelmshaven to support torpedo boats on patrol off Terschelling . On 2 October , Posen moved out into the outer <unk> of the Jade to provide cover for the returning U @-@ boats of the Flanders Flotilla . Posen was to have taken part in the last fleet operation of the war , planned for 30 October . The operation was intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany , whatever the cost to the fleet . War @-@ weary sailors mutinied , which led to the operation being canceled . In an attempt to suppress the spread of mutinous sentiments , Admiral Hipper ordered the fleet dispersed . Posen and the other ships of the I Battle Squadron were sent out into the roadstead on 3 November , then returned to Wilhelmshaven on 6 November . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 On 11 November 1918 , the Armistice took effect ; according to its terms , eleven battleships and five battlecruisers were to be interned in Scapa Flow for the duration of negotiations for the peace treaty . Posen was not among the ships interned , and she was instead decommissioned on 16 December . The ships in Scapa Flow were scuttled by their crews on 21 June 1919 to prevent them from being seized by the Allies . As a result , Posen and the other battleships that remained in Germany were seized as replacements for the ships that had been lost . On 5 November , Posen was stricken from the German navy list to be handed over to Great Britain . The ship was transferred on 13 May 1920 ; the British subsequently sold her to ship @-@ breakers in the Netherlands . Posen was broken up in Dordrecht in 1922 . 
 = Trash of the Titans = 
 " Trash of the Titans " is the 22nd episode of The Simpsons ' ninth season . The 200th episode of the series overall , it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 26 , 1998 . The episode , which was written by Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham and directed by Jim Reardon , sees Homer Simpson run for the job of Springfield 's Sanitation Commissioner . Steve Martin guest stars as Ray Patterson , the incumbent commissioner , while U2 play themselves after requesting an appearance on the show . 
 Inspired by a friend 's experience in politics , Maxtone @-@ Graham decided to have Homer run for Sanitation Commissioner , although one draft of the episode saw him running for mayor . The staff also wanted the episode to be about trash , and created the concept of " Love Day " as a means of generating waste . The episode 's resolution was discussed extensively by the staff , with one proposed idea being that Springfield would be raised up and the excess rubbish swept underneath it . The episode also features a parody of the song " The Candy Man " and an incident involving comedian Redd Foxx . 
 " Trash of the Titans " won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program ( For Programming One Hour or Less ) , something the staff believe was due to the environmental message at the end . Over ten years after the original broadcast , an airing of the episode in the United Kingdom courted controversy when it was aired on Channel 4 in April 2008 before the 9pm watershed , with the word " wanker " left unedited . 
 The episode is dedicated to the memory of Linda McCartney , who appeared alongside her husband Paul in the episode " Lisa the Vegetarian " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A local department store announces the formation of a new August holiday intended to boost sales : Love Day . The Simpsons celebrate it , but the vast amount of packaging it produces causes the garbage to build up . When Homer eventually takes it out , he is infuriated with the garbage men as they drive away without collecting the Simpson family 's trash . Angered by their ignorance , Homer insults the men by calling them " trash @-@ eating <unk> " , but this only angers them into a fight with Homer , and as a result , the family 's garbage service is cut off , leading to the Simpsons ' garbage piling up on their front lawn . 
 Homer awakens one morning to find that the pile of trash at the front of the house has been removed . He proudly boasts that he beat city hall only to learn that Marge had written a letter of apology to the Springfield Sanitation Commissioner , forging Homer 's name . Homer then goes to see the Sanitation Commissioner Ray Patterson , demanding the apology letter to be returned . Despite returning the letter , Patterson tries to be civil with Homer , but Homer insists he will get in a fight with the sanitation department . Eventually Homer decides that he will run for Sanitation Commissioner , remaking it into his image . 
 Homer begins to promote his campaign . It starts off badly with Homer being beaten up after interrupting U2 's PopMart Tour concert , but picks up when Homer thinks of a slogan for his campaign : " Can 't someone else do it ? " Homer spreads his message to the town and promises expensive services such as round @-@ the @-@ clock garbage service and having the sanitation workers do all the cleaning , leading to his landslide victory in the election . After being sworn in to the office , he shows what he plans to do by singing a parody of " The Candy Man " entitled " The Garbage Man " . 
 However , fulfilling his promises proves quite costly and after Homer 's mass spending spree , Mayor Quimby denounces him for spending the Sanitation Department 's yearly budget of $ 4 @.@ 6 million in only a month . To solve the budget crisis and pay the workers for their services , Homer gets cities all over the United States to pay him to store their excess garbage into the abandoned mine shaft on the outskirts of Springfield . Eventually , despite the budget crisis having ended and the workers receiving their salaries as promised , the garbage builds up underground and begins to erupt , pouring trash all over the town . At a town hall meeting , Homer gets fired from his post and replaced with Ray Patterson , but Patterson declines reinstatement to the position . With no one else to fill for Sanitation Commissioner to clean up the trash , Quimby then takes extreme measures by moving the entire town five miles down the road . 
 = = Production = = 
 The production team wanted the episode to be about trash , and show runner Mike Scully pitched the idea that Homer should run for office . Writer Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham had a friend who had made their way in Chicago politics , through the Sanitation Commission , and so he decided that Homer should run for Sanitation Commissioner . They then spent a lot of time trying to get to the point that Homer would have an " over filled trash can " , and through its extensive use of packaging , the concept of Love Day was formed . Originally the episode saw Homer running for mayor , but this idea was abandoned . The ending was talked about for a while , with the original idea being that the whole town would be raised up and the rubbish be swept underneath . The ending was not intended to carry an environmental message , but it played well and is what the staff believe won the episode an Emmy . 
 U2 contacted the show about doing a guest spot , rather than the other way around . The writers immediately wrote them one , in case they changed their minds . The band 's head of Principal Management Paul McGuinness and Susie Smith , an employee of Principal Management , also make brief appearances in the episode . U2 's drummer Larry Mullen , Jr. appears in the episode , although he has no dialogue . Steve Martin guest stars as Ray Patterson . 
 The episode marked the first appearance of <unk> 's department store , whose slogan is " Over a Century Without a Slogan " . It took " a lot of wasted man @-@ hours " to come up with both the name and slogan . 
 The scene where Ray Patterson is reinstated ( to which he enters and exits to the Sanford and Son theme song ) was a reference to a moment that occurred during a stand up show of comedian Redd Foxx ( who starred on Sanford and Son ) . During a show in Vegas , Redd Foxx came on stage to the Sanford and Son theme song , only to find that there were very few people in the audience . Foxx angrily stated that he refused to do a show with such a small audience and walked off the stage . The house orchestra , puzzled by Foxx 's leaving , simply played him off with the Sanford and Son theme song again . The same incident was the basis for the joke in " The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons " where Moe Szyslak walks onto the stage and , without breaking his stride , walks off .

 In its original broadcast , " Trash of the Titans " finished 16th in ratings for the week of April 20 – 26 , 1998 , with a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 5 , equivalent to approximately 10 @.@ 2 million viewing households . It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , beating King of the Hill . 
 This episode won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program ( For Programming One Hour or Less ) in 1998 . Jim Reardon won the Annie Award for " Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Television Production " . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , said : " Although not a great episode , this one has a series of high points that keep you amused until the end . " In a 2006 article in USA Today , " The Trash of the Titans " was highlighted among the six best episodes of The Simpsons season nine , along with " The Joy of Sect " , " The Last Temptation of Krust " , " The Cartridge Family " , " Dumbbell Indemnity " , and " Das Bus " . 
 During Toronto City Council deliberations over the proposal to turn the abandoned Adams Mine in Northern Ontario into a massive dump site for Toronto 's garbage , then @-@ councillors Jack Layton and Olivia Chow surprised their council colleagues by playing " Trash of the Titans " . " It was absolutely stunning " , Layton later told The Globe and Mail . " It was so accurate to what was going on . " Layton , who would later become leader of Canada 's New Democratic Party and Leader of the Official Opposition , called The Simpsons " the single most important influence on progressive social commentary in the world . "

 In 2008 , the episode caused controversy in the United Kingdom , for use of the word " wanker " . The word is first used by Adam Clayton , and later by Mr. Burns , at the end of the episode . While the word is not well known in the United States , it is considered offensive in the United Kingdom . On April 15 , 2008 , " Trash of the Titans " was broadcast on Channel 4 at 6pm , with both mentions of the word broadcast . 
 Ofcom , which deals with television complaints in the United Kingdom , received 31 complaints from viewers who felt that the episode should not have been shown before the 9pm watershed . Channel 4 said that the error was caused by a member of the compliance staff , who had incorrectly certified the programme as suitable to be shown from 6pm . The error was not corrected by the acquisitions department . Ofcom said that while they were " concerned " , it would not look into the incident any further because it was " an isolated incident " . 
 = Linwood House = 
 Linwood House was built as the homestead for Joseph Brittan , who as surgeon , newspaper editor , and provincial councillor , was one of the dominant figures in early Christchurch , New Zealand . The suburb of Linwood was named after Brittan 's farm and homestead . Brittan 's daughter Mary married William Rolleston , and they lived at Linwood House following Joseph Brittan 's death . During that time , Rolleston was the 4th ( and last ) Superintendent of the Canterbury Province , and Linwood House served for many important political and public functions . 
 The property went through many changes in ownership . Land was successively subdivided ; at its peak , 110 acres ( 450 @,@ 000 m2 ) of land belonged to Linwood House , of which only 2 @,@ 013 square metres ( 21 @,@ 670 sq ft ) remain . For some years , Linwood House was used as a private day and boarding school for girls . The house declined during the mid <unk> century , was used for flats for several decades , and was in 1985 described by an historian as the " city 's worst example of a house which should be preserved being left to decay " . The house 's fortunes improved when it was purchased in 1988 by people sympathetic to heritage . Gradually being restored , Linwood House suffered significant damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and partially collapsed in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake . Civil Defence ordered the building 's demolition , which was carried out in the second half of 2011 . 
 Architecturally , Linwood House was a rare example of a late Georgian / Regency style house in Canterbury . It had historical importance as one of the oldest surviving houses in Christchurch . The building 's association with Joseph Brittan and especially William Rolleston made it socially important . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Linwood House was located at 30 Linwood Avenue in Linwood , Christchurch . Originally located on 50 acres ( 20 ha ) of rural section ( RS ) 300 , and after the adjacent RS 301 was added , the total size of the land holding was 110 acres ( 45 ha ) . After numerous subdivisions , the size of the section was 2 @,@ 013 square metres ( 21 @,@ 670 sq ft ) . The Christchurch suburb of Linwood was named after Brittan 's farm and homestead . 
 = = History and ownership = = 
 = = = Joseph Brittan ( 1857 – 1867 ) = = = 
 Brothers Guise and Joseph Brittan , and their friend Charles Fooks had in common that they all married one of the four Chandler daughters . The Brittans were surgeons , whilst Fooks was an architect . Guise Brittan held a role of responsibility for the Canterbury Association , and he came to Christchurch on the Sir George Seymour in December 1850 , and his wife and four children travelled with him . Fooks went with them , but left his family behind in England . 
 Joseph Brittan 's wife Elizabeth Mary had died in 1849 . He remarried in a manner that was illegal at the time , socially unacceptable and causing a scandal — he took Elizabeth 's sister Sophia , the fourth Chandler daughter , as his second wife . The newly @-@ weds reacted to the scandal in a way that was not unusual at the time ; they left their problems behind and emigrated , which they did a month after the ceremony . They sailed for Christchurch on the William Hyde , which left Deal , Kent on 21 October 1851 and arrived in Lyttelton on 5 February 1852 . Mrs Fooks and her two daughters came to New Zealand with Joseph Brittan 's family . By mid @-@ 1852 , Joseph Brittan purchased RS 300 , comprising rural land about 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) east of Cathedral Square . 
 In 1855 / 56 , Guise Brittan had Englefield Lodge built on land alongside the Avon River just outside the initial town area ( these days the area to the east of Fitzgerald Avenue ) . Joseph Brittan chose land a short distance downstream along the Avon River and had his homestead , Linwood House , built in 1857 . Fooks was the architect for Linwood House , and , based on an assessment by art historian Dr Ian Lochhead , it is likely that he also designed Englefield Lodge . Joseph Brittan called his property and farm Linwood after his home in Linwood , Hampshire . 
 Joseph Brittan had varied interests and immediately upon arrival in Christchurch , joined others in various activities . He played cricket in Hagley Park within a fortnight of reaching Christchurch , and later helped improve the grounds and raised money for fencing the area . He was into horse racing , later bred horses , and Canterbury 's first steeplechase was held on his Linwood farm . The Brittans were into music and his wife Sophia Brittan brought her piano from England . Joseph Brittan had a portable harmonium and as in the early years , Lyttelton was culturally more important than Christchurch , he joined a musical group in the port town . For performances , he walked over the Bridle Path with the instrument strapped to his back . Musical evenings were also held at the Brittan home . 
 About half way between Englefield and Linwood was Holy Trinity Avonside , at the time a cob church . Guise Brittan was its churchwarden . The whole Brittan family had a close connection to the church , with Joseph Brittan helping to raise money for its construction , and his daughter Mary singing in the church choir . They faithfully attended church on Sundays . 
 Tragedy struck on 1 January 1862 , when his son Arthur drowned in the Avon River while learning to swim . He got entangled in watercress , which the Brittans themselves had introduced to the Avon , and his body was only found after a good half @-@ hour . Arthur had left school by then and was helping his father on the farm . Joseph Brittan was heartbroken and signs were that he had a period of depression . Soon after the drowning , he advertised for both a dairyman and a farmworker . He even put Linwood House up for sale , but no property transaction was recorded . 
 William Rolleston , at the time Provincial Secretary , proposed to Mary Brittan in early 1865 . He was 34 at the time , and she was 19 . Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to a marriage , which is surprising , given that Rolleston was intelligent , well educated , successful , and if anything , of higher social standing . They thought him too old for their daughter , her too young to marry . Maybe Sophia Brittan did not want to lose her daughter , who was in effect running the household and entertained guests , as she was often too ill to look after these tasks herself . But Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs , which required moving to Wellington . Hence , the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church , before the newly @-@ weds moved to the capital . 
 Joseph Brittan 's health declined during 1867 . Of distress for the family were the financial affairs , with various debts that only Joseph knew about . Rolleston tried to give financial advice to both Sophia and her son Frank , but he was ignored . Joseph Brittan died on 27 October 1867 at Linwood House . 
 Brittan Street in Linwood , named after Joseph Brittan , first appeared in street directories in 1892 . Today , the Linwood House section fronts onto both Linwood Avenue and Brittan Street . 
 = = = Sophia Brittan ( 1867 – 1877 ) = = = 
 Sophia Brittan inherited the house and land from her late husband . Initially , it was left to her son Frank to run the farm . In 1868 , there were rumours that William Sefton Moorhouse would resign as Canterbury Superintendent , and Rolleston was encouraged to make himself available . He returned to Christchurch , whilst his wife Mary and their two children remained in Wellington . Rolleston was elected unopposed on 22 May 1868 . And on 8 June , he was elected to Parliament in the 1868 by @-@ election in the Avon electorate . Late in 1868 , the Rollestons moved back to Christchurch to live at Linwood House . This was a delicate affair , as this made conditions cramped ( Sophia , her sons Joe and Frank , the Rollestons with their two children , plus servants made for cramped living in the eight rooms ) , and there has always been tension between William Rolleston and Frank Brittan . Mary Rolleston arranged for her oldest brother Joe , who had some disability , to live with his aunt , Mrs Fooks . Charles Fooks was imprisoned at that time , and it was good for Mrs Fooks to have a male live with her . The Rollestons paid rent , which helped Sophia Brittan service the mortgage . With Rolleston Superintendent until the abolition of Provincial Government at the end of 1876 , Linwood House hosted many important social and political functions . 
 Linwood farm was used for sporting events . In July 1876 , the Christchurch rugby team met their South Canterbury counterparts from Timaru ( Christchurch won the game ) , and in May 1877 , the Canterbury Hunt Club met for a steeplechase in the sand hills of the farm . 
 = = = Frank Brittan ( 1877 – 1889 ) = = = 
 Sophia Brittan died in August 1877 . Whilst the Rollestons had carried the Brittan family financially over the last decade , their contributions went practically unrecognised . Mary Rolleston inherited £ 400 and the piano , her oldest brother received an annual annuity of £ 20 , and Frank Brittan was given the farm , the house and all its contents . William Rolleston was " shocked , hurt and astonished " by the unfairness of this distribution . Contact between the Rollestons and Frank Brittan all but ceased . Much later in life , Mary Rolleston would see her brother briefly once a year on New Year 's Day at his home , and that was all the contact that they had . 
 In May 1878 , Frank Brittan sold 58 acres ( 23 ha ) of land subdivided into 231 sections for a total of £ 18 @,@ 489 . He made a handsome profit , as much of the land was purchased three years earlier for £ 49 per hectare , and he sold the land for some £ 318 per acre ( £ 127 per ha ) . Linwood Estate was located east of Stanmore Road , and comprised the extensions of Cashel , Hereford , and Worcester Streets . At the same auction , Brittan sold all his stock and farming implements , as he had bought <unk> Estate in Selwyn County . Further subdivision followed in 1886 . 
 = = = Edward Hiorns ( 1889 – 1912 ) = = = 
 Edward Hiorns ( 1838 – 7 July 1912 ) emigrated in 1862 from England . Originally a plumber and tinsmith , he became a hotelier . From 1881 to 1883 , he was a member of Christchurch City Council , and later stood for office on the Linwood Borough Council . Hiorns was Masonic Grand Master of New Zealand , and attended the 1897 Queen Victoria Golden Jubilee in England in that capacity . 
 Frank Brittan sold Linwood House to Hiorns in 1889 , who commissioned architect John Whitelaw to design an extension . This resulted in a drawing room , a billiard room and a study to be added to the house . In 1898 , Hiorns leased Linwood House to Sir John Denniston for five years . Hiorns had retired from business and spent some of his time in Sydney . Denniston , the oldest son of Thomas Denniston and married to the daughter of John Bathgate , was a judge at the Supreme Court in Christchurch . 
 After Denniston had moved out , Hiorns carried out further subdivisions in 1903 and 1905 . For a time , Linwood House was reputedly leased to Alexander Boyle . He was one of the founders of Pyne and Co , which later became Pyne Gould Guinness , of which Boyle was chairman of the board . 
 In September 1903 , Helen McKee and her mother relocated their boarding and day school for girls , Avonside College , from Inveresk ( the former dwelling of John Anderson ) to Linwood House . Helen McKee was a daughter of the highly esteemed Rev. David McKee , who came to New Zealand in January 1880 as the first vicar of North Belt Church ( later known as Knox Church ) . The Reverend died after only ten months in New Zealand , though . The congregation provided generously for his widow and her children , and at some point , his wife started a school . Helen McKee became a pupil teacher at Riccarton School in 1887 . Avonside College remained at Linwood House until 1911 , when it relocated to Rhodes Street and was renamed Meriden College . 
 The Hiorns returned from Sydney in 1911 and lived at Linwood House . Amelia Hiorns died in December of that year , and Edward Hiorns died on 7 July 1912 . 
 = = = Various owners ( 1913 – 1988 ) = = = 
 Although the Hiorns had descendants , the estate was managed by the Public Trustee , who put Linwood House up for sale as four sections , with one of those holding the house itself . Three of the sections were purchased by Thomas Marker on 4 June 1913 in an auction , including the one containing the building . Marker paid ₤ 200 each for the building sections , and ₤ 1 @,@ 250 for the section containing the house . The furniture of Linwood House was sold in a separate auction . The house was rented to lawyer Francis Ion Cowlishaw , son of prominent provincial councillor William Patten Cowlishaw ( 1839 – 1903 ) . Cowlishaw senior had lived nearby in a house named ' <unk> ' , and Cowlishaw Street and <unk> Lane are named after the family . 
 Francis Cowlishaw purchased Linwood House in 1916 for ₤ 1 @,@ 592 . In 1920 , a dance of Christchurch 's social elite was held at Linwood House . Cowlishaw sold the house later that year to Mrs Ethel Pyne , the widow of Frederick Pyne ( d . 1915 ) , who was a business partner of former Linwood House lessee Alexander Boyle . Immediately after the purchase , Ethel Pyne engaged Sidney and Alfred Luttrell to design a ₤ 700 extension to the house , and it is assumed that this was the addition of a second storey to an earlier service wing . Further subdivisions were carried out in 1927 and 1932 , after which Linwood House was sold to Florence Simpson in the latter year . Simpson in turn undertook subdivision in 1935 , before selling the remainder to Gordon <unk> , a solicitor , in 1945 . Records reveal that by 1948 , there were six residents living at Linwood House , indicating that the house had been set up for <unk> in the meantime . <unk> subdivided the land behind Linwood House in 1958 . He died in 1972 , and his widow sold the property in the same year to Advance Buildings ( Nelson ) Ltd ; her daughter was a partner in that company . Local historian John Wilson , who in 1984 wrote the book Lost Christchurch , that year called Linwood House the " city 's worst example of a house which should be preserved being left to decay " . 
 = = = Paddy and Jacky Snowdon ( 1988 – present ) = = = 
 Paddy and Jacky Snowdon bought the property in 1988 . They increased occupancy to seven flats , carried out alterations and achieved compliance with fire regulations . The <unk> undertook renovations that were long overdue , and that were sympathetic to the historic significance of the building . By 2002 , a conservation report had been completed . 
 Linwood House suffered significant damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake . The upstairs and the roof got braced after the event , and this was beneficial when the 2011 Christchurch earthquake struck , but internal walls and fireplaces just " crumbled " .

 A symposium was held on 7 December 2012 in Wellington on New Zealand architecture in the 1850s . One of the papers given was " Gentlemen 's residences in 1850s Christchurch : An examination of the homes of William Rolleston and John Cracroft Wilson " .

 Linwood House was registered as a heritage building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust on 17 August 1982 with registration number 3119 classified as D. With the change of the classification system , the building later became a Category II listing . 
 = = Architectural and building history = = 
 The 1857 house is in Regency architectural style . It was oriented so that its long side , facing north @-@ east , was roughly parallel to Linwood Avenue . Rectangular in floor plan , the Linwood Avenue frontage had five bays , with the central bay pedimented , which gave the house a symmetrical look . An 1871 photo by Alfred Charles Barker , held by the Canterbury Museum , shows a verandah on the north @-@ west side of the building only . This verandah was later extended to cover the front as well , and it mirrors the pedimented central bay . A hipped roof was hidden behind a balustrade . 
 The house was constructed in double brick , and it is this unreinforced masonry construction that was unable to cope with the earthquake forces . Upstairs , windows were round @-@ headed . Downstairs , many of the openings were French doors . 
 The New Zealand Historic Places Trust ( <unk> ) was for a time uncertain who the architect was . In about 1995 , the last owner 's daughter , when undertaking research for a school assignment , came across the architect 's sketch of Linwood House in the Anglican Church archives , and this proved that Charles Fooks , the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Joseph Brittan , designed the house . 
 A significant extension was designed in 1889 by John Whitelaw . The south @-@ west wing , ' behind ' the original house , used the different architectural style of a Victorian villa for the two @-@ storey addition . The <unk> assumes that at the same time , a single storey extension was built onto the south @-@ east side . 
 The last significant extension was added in 1920 , which was designed by the Luttrell Brothers . The south @-@ east wing was much more in keeping with the original design . It is possible that the architects designed a second storey for the service wing that had been built in 1889 . This extension connected the original house with the original washhouse . 
 In 1972 , a kitchen and small toilet were added as a lean @-@ to . These were removed again in ca 1990 .

 According to Homme , " No One Knows " existed before the recording sessions for Songs for the Deaf : 
 We have patience with music , a year or five years down the road it may kind of rewrite itself and become what it 's supposed to be . There 's two songs on this record that are over five years old , you know ? ' God is the Radio ' and ' No One Knows ' . 
 Recording for Songs for the Deaf began in March 2002 at three studios across California .

 = Speed 2 : Cruise Control = 
 Speed 2 : Cruise Control is a 1997 American disaster thriller film , and a sequel to Speed ( 1994 ) . The film was produced and directed by Jan de Bont , and written by Randall McCormick and Jeff Nathanson , based on a story by de Bont and McCormick . Sandra Bullock stars in the film , reprising her role from Speed , while Jason Patric and Willem Dafoe co @-@ star . The film was released by 20th Century Fox on June 13 , 1997 . 
 The plot involves couple Annie and Alex taking a vacation in the Caribbean aboard a luxury cruise ship , which is hijacked by a villain named Geiger who hacked into the ship 's computer system . As they are trapped aboard the ship , Annie and Alex work with the ship 's first officer to try to stop the ship , which they discover is programmed to crash into an oil tanker . 
 De Bont came up with the idea for the film after he had a recurring nightmare about a cruise ship crashing into an island . Speed star Keanu Reeves was initially supposed to reprise his role as Jack Traven for the sequel , but decided not to commit and was replaced by Patric prior to filming . Production took place aboard Seabourn Legend , the ship on which the film is set . The film 's final scene , where the ship crashes into the island of Saint Martin , cost almost a quarter of the film 's budget , and set records as the largest and most expensive stunt ever filmed . Many interior scenes aboard the ship were shot on soundstages in the Greater Los Angeles Area . The film 's soundtrack featured mostly reggae music . Mark Mancina returned to compose the film score , which was released as an album 13 years after the film 's release . 
 The critical reception was extremely negative , criticizing its acting , story , and characters . One major criticism was that the film 's setting on a slow @-@ moving cruise ship was much less thrilling than Speed 's setting on a fast @-@ moving bus . The film was also a financial disappointment , earning $ 164 million worldwide against a budget of $ 110 million . It was nominated for eight Golden Raspberry Awards , and won the award for " Worst Re @-@ Make or Sequel " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Alex Shaw is on a motorcycle chase after a vehicle with stolen goods . He eventually catches the driver of the vehicle , but his girlfriend Annie runs into him during her driving test . She finds out that Alex is on the SWAT team after he lied and told her he was a beach cop . As an apology , Alex surprises her with a Caribbean cruise on Seabourn Legend . 
 Aboard the ship , passenger John Geiger hacks into the ship 's computer system , and the following evening , he destroys the ship 's communication systems and kills the captain by throwing him overboard . After remotely shutting down the ship 's engines , Geiger calls the bridge to tell the first officer , Juliano , that the captain is dead and Juliano is now in charge . He is ordered by Geiger to evacuate the ship , during which Geiger steals jewelry from the ship 's vault . As passengers evacuate , Drew , a young deaf girl , becomes trapped in an elevator , and a group of people become trapped behind locked fire doors in a hallway filling up with smoke . Annie and Alex try to board the last lifeboat , however , Geiger programs the ship to start moving and the winch lowering the lifeboat gets jammed . Alex jumps onto the boat to rescue the passengers falling off , and Annie and Juliano use the ship 's gangplank to get the passengers back onto the deck . 
 Alex realizes Geiger is controlling the ship and goes with Juliano to Geiger 's cabin armed with skeet guns , but Geiger remotely sets off explosives inside the room . Annie and Dante , the ship 's photographer , notice the people trapped behind the fire doors , and Annie uses a chainsaw to cut the door open and let them out . Meanwhile , Alex orders the navigator , Merced , to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the ballast doors . As the ship floods , Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she climbed out of the elevator , and runs to save her . Alex notices Geiger exiting the vault and holds him at gunpoint , but Geiger escapes by closing the fire door in front of Alex . Using the ship 's intercom , Geiger explains that he designed the ship 's autopilot system and is taking revenge against the cruise line after getting fired once he got sick from copper poisoning . Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door . 
 The crew notice that Geiger has set the ship to crash into an oil tanker off the coast of Saint Martin . Alex decides to stop the ship by diving underneath it and jamming the propeller with a steel cable . Geiger realizes Alex is trying to stop the ship , so he jams the cable winch while Alex is underwater , causing it to break off the ship and free the cable . Geiger takes Annie hostage and escapes with her on a boat from the back of the ship . 
 To avoid collision with the oil tanker , Alex and Dante go into the bilge pump room and use the bow thrusters to turn the ship . The ship screeches down the side of the tanker , but manages to withstand the damage , and heads straight into a marina . It then crashes into a Saint Martin town , which eventually brings the ship to a halt . Alex jumps off to rescue Annie and hijacks a speed boat from Maurice , forcing him to chase after Annie . Geiger takes Annie onto a seaplane , and Alex shoots it from the boat with a speargun and reels himself in through the water . Alex climbs onto the plane and rescues Annie , and both escape from the plane on one of its floats , which falls onto the water . Geiger loses control of the plane and crashes into the oil tanker , causing it to explode . The tanker crew however are safe , because they launched their lifeboat just in time . Annie and Alex travel back to shore in Maurice 's boat , and Alex gives Annie an engagement ring , asking her if she will " wear it for a while " , and she accepts .
