 = = Economy = = 
 The Denver MSA has a gross metropolitan product of $ 157 @.@ 6 billion in 2010 , making it the 18th largest metro economy in the United States . Denver 's economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection to some of the major transportation systems of the country . Because Denver is the largest city within 500 miles ( 800 km ) , it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the Mountain States , Southwest states , as well as all western states . Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the Midwest , such as Chicago and St. Louis and some large cities of the West Coast , such as Los Angeles and San Francisco . 
 Over the years , the city has been home to other large corporations in the central United States , making Denver a key trade point for the country . Several well @-@ known companies originated in or have relocated to Denver . William Ainsworth opened the Denver Instrument Company in 1895 to make analytical balances for gold <unk> . Its factory is now in Arvada . <unk> ( NYSE : <unk> ) — the largest owner and operator of apartment communities in the United States , with approximately 870 communities comprising nearly 136 @,@ 000 units in 44 states — is headquartered in Denver , employing approximately 3 @,@ 500 people . Also Samsonite Corp. , the world 's largest luggage manufacturer , began in Denver in 1910 as <unk> Trunk Manufacturing Company , but Samsonite closed its NE Denver factory in 2001 , and moved its headquarters to Massachusetts after a change of ownership in 2006 . The Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Company , founded in Denver in 1911 , is now a part of telecommunications giant CenturyLink .

 Geography also allows Denver to have a considerable government presence , with many federal agencies based or having offices in the Denver area . Along with federal agencies come many companies based on US defense and space projects , and more jobs are brought to the city by virtue of its being the capital of the state of Colorado . The Denver area is home to the former nuclear weapons plant Rocky Flats , the Denver Federal Center , Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse , the Denver Mint , and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory . 
 In 2005 , a $ 310 @.@ 7 million expansion for the Colorado Convention Center was completed , doubling its size . The hope was that the center 's expansion would elevate the city to one of the top 10 cities in the nation for holding a convention . 
 Denver 's position near the mineral @-@ rich Rocky Mountains encouraged mining and energy companies to spring up in the area . In the early days of the city , gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the economic success of the city . In the 1970s and early 1980s , the energy crisis in America and resulting high oil prices created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap opera Dynasty . Denver was built up considerably during this time with the construction of many new downtown skyscrapers . When the price of oil dropped from $ 34 a barrel in 1981 to $ 9 a barrel in 1986 , the Denver economy dropped with it , leaving almost 15 @,@ 000 oil industry workers in the area unemployed ( including former mayor and current governor John Hickenlooper , a former geologist ) , and the highest office vacancy rate in the nation ( 30 % ) . Since then , the industry has recovered and there remain 700 employed petroleum engineers in the region . Advances is hydraulic fracturing has made the DJ Basin of Colorado into an accessible and lucrative oil play .

 Denver 's west @-@ central geographic location in the Mountain Time Zone ( UTC − 7 ) also benefits the telecommunications industry by allowing communication with both North American coasts , South America , Europe , and Asia in the same business day . Denver 's location on the 105th meridian at over one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) in elevation also enables it to be the largest city in the U.S. to offer a " one @-@ bounce " real @-@ time satellite uplink to six continents in the same business day . Qwest Communications , Dish Network Corporation , Starz @-@ Encore , DIRECTV , and Comcast are a few of the many telecommunications companies with operations in the Denver area . These and other high @-@ tech companies had a boom in Denver in the mid to late 1990s . Denver had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation at 3 @.@ 8 % in October 2007 . As of April 2015 , the unemployment rate for the Denver @-@ Aurora @-@ Broomfield MSA is 4 @.@ 2 % . The Downtown region has seen increased real estate investment with the construction of several new skyscrapers set to be completed in 2010 – 2013 .

Denver and the metropolitan areas around it continued to support culture . In 1988 , voters in the Denver Metropolitan Area approved the Scientific and Cultural Facilities Tax ( commonly known as <unk> ) , a 1 cent sales tax that contributes money to various cultural and scientific facilities and organizations throughout the Metro area . The tax was renewed by voters in 1994 and 2004 and allows the <unk> to operate until 2018 .

 Many of Denver 's parks were acquired from state lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . This coincided with the City Beautiful movement , and Denver mayor Robert Speer ( 1904 – 12 and 1916 – 18 ) set out to expand and beautify the city 's parks . Reinhard Schuetze was the city 's first landscape architect , and he brought his German @-@ educated landscaping genius to Washington Park , Cheesman Park , and City Park among others . Speer used Schuetze as well as other landscape architects such as Frederick Law Olmsted , Jr. and Saco <unk> DeBoer to design not only parks such as Civic Center Park , but many city parkways and tree @-@ lawns . All of this greenery was fed with South Platte River water diverted through the city ditch .

 In 2005 , Denver became the first major city in the U.S. to vote to make the private possession of less than an ounce of marijuana legal for adults 21 and older . The city voted 53 @.@ 5 percent in favor of the marijuana legalization measure , which , as then @-@ mayor John Hickenlooper pointed out , was without effect , because the city cannot usurp state law , which at that time treated marijuana possession in much the same way as a speeding ticket , with fines of up to $ 100 and no jail time . Denver passed an initiative in the fourth quarter of 2007 requiring the mayor to appoint an 11 @-@ member review panel to monitor the city 's compliance with the 2005 ordinance . In 2012 , Colorado Amendment 64 was signed into law by Governor John Hickenlooper and at the beginning of 2014 Colorado became the first state to allow the sale of marijuana for recreational use .

 = = = City streets = = = 
 Most of Denver has a straightforward street grid oriented to the four cardinal directions . Blocks are usually identified in hundreds from the median streets , identified as " 00 " , which are Broadway ( the east – west median , running north – south ) and Ellsworth Avenue ( the north – south median , running east – west ) . Colfax Avenue , a major east – west artery through Denver , is 15 blocks ( 1500 ) north of the median . Avenues north of Ellsworth are numbered ( with the exception of Colfax Avenue and several others , such as Martin Luther King , Jr . Blvd and <unk> Blvd . ) , while avenues south of Ellsworth are named . 
 There is also an older downtown grid system that was designed to be parallel to the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek . Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast – southwest and northwest – southeast . This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal ; if the streets were in a normal N – S / E – W grid , only the N – S streets would receive sunlight . With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions , the NW – SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE – SW streets receive it in the afternoon . This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the Brown Palace Hotel . There is now a plaque across the street from the Brown Palace Hotel which honors this idea . The NW – SE streets are numbered , while the NE – SW streets are named . The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block @-@ long Cheyenne Place . The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I @-@ 25 viaducts . There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid . There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid , such as Park Avenue , Morrison Road , and Speer Boulevard . Larimer Street , named after William Larimer , Jr . , the founder of Denver , which is located in the heart of LoDo , is the oldest street in Denver . 
 All roads in the downtown grid system are streets ( e.g. 16th Street , Stout Street ) . Roads outside that system that travel east / west are given the suffix " avenue " and those that head north and south are given the " street " suffix ( e.g. Colfax Avenue , Lincoln Street ) . Boulevards are higher capacity streets and travel any direction ( more commonly north and south ) . Smaller roads are sometimes referred to as places , drives ( though not all drives are smaller capacity roads , some are major thoroughfares ) or courts . Most streets outside the area between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard are organized alphabetically from the city 's center . 
 Many Denver streets have bicycle lanes , and there are over 850 miles of paved , off @-@ road , bike paths in Denver parks and along bodies of water , like Cherry Creek and the South Platte .

 State Highway 470 ( C @-@ 470 , SH 470 ) is the southwestern portion of the Denver metro area 's beltway . Originally planned as Interstate 470 in the 1960s , the beltway project was attacked on environmental impact grounds and the interstate beltway was never built . The portion of " Interstate 470 " that was built as a state highway is the present @-@ day SH 470 , which is a freeway for its entire length . 
 Denver also has a nearly complete beltway known as " the 470 's " . These are SH 470 ( also known as C @-@ 470 ) , a freeway in the southwest Metro area , and two toll highways , E @-@ 470 ( from southeast to northeast ) and Northwest Parkway ( from terminus of E @-@ 470 to US 36 ) . SH 470 was originally intended to be I @-@ 470 and built with federal highway funds , but the funding was redirected to complete conversion of downtown Denver 's 16th Street to a pedestrian mall . As a result , construction was delayed until 1980 after state and local legislation was passed . I @-@ 470 was also once called " The Silver Stake Highway " , from Gov. Lamm 's declared intention to drive a silver stake through it and kill it . 
 A highway expansion and transit project for the southern I @-@ 25 corridor , dubbed T @-@ REX ( Transportation Expansion Project ) , was completed on November 17 , 2006 . The project installed wider and additional highway lanes , and improved highway access and drainage . The project also includes a light rail line that traverses from downtown to the south end of the metro area at Lincoln Avenue . The project spanned almost 19 miles ( 31 km ) along the highway with an additional line traveling parallel to part of I @-@ 225 , stopping just short of Parker Road .

 = Little Green Men ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Little Green Men " is the first episode of the second season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on September 16 , 1994 in the United States . It was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on August 28 , 1995 . The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong , and directed by David Nutter . The episode helped explore the series ' overarching mythology . " Little Green Men " earned a Nielsen household rating of 10 @.@ 3 , being watched by 9 @.@ 8 million households in its initial broadcast . The episode received largely positive reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In the episode , Mulder goes to the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico to continue his search for proof on extraterrestrial life . Meanwhile , Scully attempts to aid him after being separated following the closure of the X @-@ Files . 
 " Little Green Men " was written specifically as a way for Mulder to question his belief in aliens . The episode features the first appearance of an extraterrestrial , because series creator Chris Carter felt it was time to unveil one . In addition , the episode introduces the character of Senator Richard Matheson . Matheson was named after the sci @-@ fi and horror writer Richard Matheson , who wrote many episodes of The Twilight Zone . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the episode 's prologue , Fox Mulder narrates a history of NASA 's Voyager program and the now @-@ defunct High Resolution Microwave Survey , which sought to contact extraterrestrial life in outer space . At the Survey 's abandoned observatory in Arecibo , Puerto Rico , the equipment inside suddenly activates , indicating a response from an alien intelligence . 
 Since the closure of the X @-@ Files , the FBI has reassigned Mulder to a low @-@ level wiretap while his former partner , Dana Scully , has returned to teaching at the FBI Academy . The two have a discreet meeting at the parking lot of the Watergate Hotel , where Mulder admits that he has been doubting his belief in the paranormal since Deep Throat 's assassination . Mulder flashes back to the night when his sister , Samantha , was abducted . 
 Mulder is summoned to a meeting with Richard Matheson , a U.S. senator who is a patron for his work . Matheson directs Mulder to Arecibo , assuring the agent that he will try to hold off a Blue Beret UFO retrieval team said to be headed there in twenty @-@ four hours . Mulder arrives at the Survey station , where he finds a frightened Puerto Rican man , Jorge , who draws a picture of an alien that he claims to have seen . Meanwhile , Scully , unaware of Mulder 's whereabouts , tries to find him . Reviewing a list of flights from Washington , Scully tracks Mulder down to Puerto Rico . 
 Mulder discovers a signal , possibly originating from an extraterrestrial intelligence . During a storm , Jorge gets scared and runs outside . Mulder finds him dead of fright . When Scully goes to an airport to fly to Puerto Rico , she realizes she 's being tracked by a couple , but manages to escape from them . Meanwhile , as Mulder investigates Jorge 's corpse , the room shakes . The door opens and the shadowy figure of an alien appears . Scully wakes Mulder up the next morning , finding him excited about the readouts and tapes of the signals — the proof of aliens he has sought for so long . However , the Blue Beret team arrives , forcing them to flee with only a tape reel . 
 Upon his return to Washington , Mulder is admonished by Assistant Director Walter Skinner and the Smoking Man for his actions . Mulder claims he still had enough evidence with the days missed to prosecute the subject of his assigned wiretap , and that his own phone calls were being monitored . Skinner then demands that the Smoking Man leave the room , and decides to not discipline Mulder . Investigating the tape reel , Mulder finds it blank due to a power surge during the storm , but vows to continue his work regardless .

 = = = Writing and casting = = = 
 This episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong and directed by David Nutter . Originally , the season two premiere was supposed to be written by series creator Chris Carter . In the rough draft of this version , Mulder would have been sent to Moscow . Carter , instead , assigned Morgan and Wong the task of writing the season opener . Before working on The X @-@ Files , Morgan had written a script with the same name about a man who goes to a telescope located in Chile . The script was never made , but Morgan liked various elements of it , so he cannibalized parts for " Little Green Men " . In addition , the episode was specifically written for Mulder to question himself and his beliefs . According to the two writers , one of the main themes of the episode is “ the idea that we all have to fight our own little green men and carry on . ” 
 Senator Matheson was named after the sci @-@ fi and horror writer Richard Matheson , who wrote many episodes of The Twilight Zone . Matheson was also originally the character who was to recite the episode 's opening monologue . Darren McGavin , of Kolchak : The Night Stalker , was the casting directors ' first choice for the role of Senator Matheson . McGavin was later sought out to be Mulder 's dad , but he again eluded the staff . In the end , McGavin finally agreed to appear on the show during its fifth season ; he was first introduced in the episode " Travelers " as Arthur Dales , the agent who originally founded the X @-@ Files . The role of Matheson eventually went to Raymond J. Barry . The episode marks the first visualization of Samantha 's abduction by aliens . Although there are discrepancies between the depiction of her abduction in this episode and Mulder 's description of it in both " Pilot " and " Conduit " , Carter has attributed this to the unreliability of Mulder 's hypnosis @-@ induced memories . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The Puerto Rican scenes were filmed at the Seymour Demonstration Forest in North Vancouver District , while the Plaza of Nations doubled for the Miami Airport . Gillian Anderson revealed on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien that when she and Duchovny were filming the final scene escaping the Blue Berets , the actors portraying the soldiers had to pretend to shoot their guns with their own sound effects , and that " it was very hard to focus without breaking out laughing . " At the airport , Scully is pretending to read the fictional Miami Post Tribune but closer inspection reveals that she is actually reading the " Facts And Arguments " page from Canada 's national paper , The Globe and Mail . The flight manifest that Scully is scanning in search for Mulder is a list of X @-@ Files fans . 
 Extraterrestrials make their first appearance in this episode , as Carter thought it would be a good moment to reveal them . The image of the alien was stretched in post @-@ production to make it look taller and skinnier . The writers for the episode researched various abductee reports and conspiracy theories in order to get the right feel for the episode and make the aliens appear realistic and not " fanciful " . The episode makes several mentions to the Voyager program and the Voyager Golden Record ; Mulder and Senator Matheson listen to Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F. First Movement while in the latter 's office . The concerto 's first movement is the first piece of music on the Voyager record . In addition , the episode relies heavily on mentions of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) program , the collective name for a number of activities people undertake to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life . Morgan later explained , “ I always wanted to do something with the SETI background . Hope that kids at school check out SETI , because it was factual as to what exists . ”

" The site ultimately gave the episode a B. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club positively compared and contrasted the episode to the cartoon Scooby Doo , Where Are You ? writing that , " I used to be a huge " Scooby Doo " fan . [ ... ] Of course , none of [ the villains ] were really monsters . [ ... ] The X @-@ Files exploited a simple truth : we all want to believe . We might be afraid of what 's lurking in the dark , but isn 't there always a bit of wishing inside that fear ? A hope that what we think we know isn 't everything there is to know . That just once it might be nice to reach for a zipper and instead find nothing but cool scales . " Handlen ultimately called the episode " Essential . " Reviewer Dan Barrett from the 400 Club wrote that " The X @-@ Files is off to a stonking good start with this season 2 opening . " Bob <unk> , writing for the Los Angeles Daily News , called the episode " an engrossing chiller about potential contact from outer space . " He compared the episode positively to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and noted that the episode was " both scary and wondrous " and " offer [ ed ] no pat answers that might tend to blow the credibility . " Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode five stars out of five , writing that the episode was not " what the fans were expecting , and its reputation isn 't great .

Executive producer Al Jean spoke to Entertainment Weekly in September 2014 about the third segment of the episode , and the difference in voices between the older and newer versions of the characters . He said that although Dan Castellaneta ’ s portrayal of Homer is better remembered for its evolution over time , Nancy Cartwright ’ s voicing of Bart changed as well , because " it was lower @-@ register , and you can see in the difference in this segment .

Writing for the New York Daily News , Don Kaplan gave the episode four stars out of five , singling the third segment out as the best , and deeming the Kubrick homage " smart and silly " . A more mixed review came from Alex Strachan on Postmedia News ' Canada.com , who found the second segment to be the best and the other two to be average , although he admitted that the Kubrick references were " occasionally a little too inside or self @-@ indulgent for their own good " .

 The Pacific Tower , formerly the Pacific Medical Center , is a 16 @-@ story building on Beacon Hill in Seattle , Washington . It is located at 1200 12th Avenue South . It was completed in 1932 and opened in 1933 as a Marine Hospital Service facility . The lower floors of the facility still function as a medical center today . Amazon.com occupied much of the building as its headquarters for several years . Much of the space was left vacant after Amazon relocated to South Lake Union . In 2013 , the State of Washington agreed to a 30 @-@ year lease of 13 floors . Seattle Central Community College <unk> six floors for its healthcare training program . 
 The building was designed by Carl Frelinghuysen Gould of Bebb and Gould with assistance from John Graham & Company . The architecture has a distinctive Art Deco style . The structure is perched on a hill overlooking downtown Seattle and is a prominent piece of the city 's skyline . It has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places and has been recognized as a landmark by the City of Seattle . The building was retrofitted to better withstand an earthquake in the 1990s . However , portions of the building suffered significant damage and required repair due to the 2001 Nisqually earthquake . 
 = = History = = 
 The building was opened in 1933 by the U.S. government as a United States Marine Hospital Service hospital . Replacing a facility in Port Townsend , it opened with 312 beds in 1933 . The hospital originally served veterans , merchant seamen , the US Coast Guard , the US Lighthouse Service , and poor and indigent people defined as “ federal compensation cases ” . In 1951 , it was re @-@ designated as a US Public Health Service facility along with all other Marine hospitals . In 1953 , a three @-@ story annex was constructed on the east end of the building to serve outpatient clinics . Two stair towers were added to the south face in 1975 . The building continued to grow in 1980 as a laboratory and primary care addition were built . The federal government ceased operation of the facility and other similar hospitals in 1981 . Control was shifted to Seattle , and the city chartered the Pacific Hospital Preservation and Development Authority ( PHPDA ) . The PHPDA owns the property and uses long @-@ term tenants with leases . Lease revenues are advance the PHPDA ’ s mission of providing health care services to low @-@ income uninsured and under @-@ insured persons in King County . The lease agreement with <unk> Tower LLC was signed in 1998 and was terminated in 2012 . 
 A $ 9 @.@ 3 million county bond paid for seismic improvements between 1991 and 1994 . A new tower was constructed on the north side of the building to create a buttress for the original structure . The addition was designed by architects Zimmer <unk> Frasca , and received an award from the American Institute of Architects for is innovate design that was inline with the building 's historical facade . The project created 70 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 6 @,@ 500 m2 ) of additional space that was not initially occupied . As the medical organization struggled financially , attempts to lease at least 155 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 14 @,@ 400 m2 ) of the building failed over the course of several years . With medical facilities continuing to occupy the bottom two floors of the building in 1998 , Amazon.com signed a sublease for $ 1 @.@ 5 million a year through 2010 . 
 The building suffered substantial damage during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake as the structure 's upper floor twisted in a corkscrew fashion . On the top three floors , 80 percent of the perimeter walls were damaged . A brick pinnacle on the upper roof collapsed and fell through a roof on the 10th floor . An elevator shaft and five floors were flooded when a mechanical water line ruptured . There were no injuries but it was estimated that the repairs would cost $ 6 million . During repairs , efforts were made to reuse the brick and terracotta , and the same colors and style were sourced when replacement was needed . 
 Amazon continued to occupy their floors during rehabilitation of the structure . In 2003 , the clinical group practice of the PHPDA officially split off to form a 501 ( c ) 3 health care organization , <unk> Clinics ( doing business as Pacific Medical Centers or PMC ) . The Pacific Medical Center Clinic continues to operate in the first two floors of the building . In 2010 , Amazon.com ended its sub @-@ lease with <unk> Tower LLC and began the move of its headquarters to a new campus in the city 's South Lake Union neighborhood . Much of the building was left vacant without new tenants moving into the space . The location outside of downtown Seattle was a constraint for businesses . 
 Washington State House Speaker Frank Chopp spearheaded a plan to use government funding to move community college health programs into the building . In August 2013 , the PHPDA announced a 30 @-@ year lease with the Washington State Department of Commerce for 13 stories of Pacific Tower . Six of the stories will be subleased to Seattle Central Community College for its healthcare training programs . Multiple nonprofits are prospective tenants .

 Architectural firm Bebb and Gould , assisted by the John Graham Company , designed the original structure . Carl Frelinghuysen Gould designed it in an Art Deco style . Located 350 ft ( 110 m ) above sea level at the northern edge of Beacon Hill , the 239 ft ( 73 m ) tower overlooks downtown Seattle and Elliott Bay . The 259 @,@ 703 sq ft ( 24 @,@ 127 @.@ 2 m2 ) building sits on a 9 @.@ 5 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 8 ha ) landscaped property . It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 . In 1992 , the building received landmark status from the city . The northern addition completed in 1994 was considered significant by the American Institute of Architects . It was noted that the exterior of the building could have been supported by new beams and trusses . Instead , the new space integrated almost seamlessly with the original building while being seismically beneficial . 
 The main building and its surrounding campus are surrounded by manicured grounds . The property includes six buildings near the primary structure . These were originally quarters for officers but have since been converted into laboratory and office space . The buildings are in the same style as the main building with facades that include terracotta and brick in patterns resembling woven baskets . Other additions include a parking garage and smaller metal buildings . The property is surrounded by a detailed wrought iron fence . 
 = Forth ( programming language ) = 
 Forth is an imperative stack @-@ based computer programming language and environment originally designed by Charles " Chuck " Moore . Language features include structured programming , reflection ( the ability to modify the program structure during program execution ) , <unk> programming ( functions are composed with juxtaposition ) and <unk> ( the programmer can create new commands ) . Although not an acronym , the language 's name is sometimes spelled with all capital letters as FORTH , following the customary usage during its earlier years . 
 A procedural programming language without type checking , Forth features both interactive execution of commands ( making it suitable as a shell for systems that lack a more formal operating system ) and the ability to compile sequences of commands for later execution . Some Forth implementations ( usually early versions or those written to be extremely portable ) compile threaded code , but many implementations today generate optimized machine code like other language compilers . 
 Forth is used in the Open Firmware boot loader , in space applications , such as the Philae spacecraft and other embedded systems which involve interaction with hardware . The bestselling 1986 DOS game Starflight , from Electronic Arts , was written with a custom Forth . 
 The free software <unk> implementation is actively maintained , as are several commercially supported systems . 
 = = Overview = = 
 A Forth environment combines the compiler with an interactive shell , where the user defines and runs subroutines called words . Words can be tested , redefined , and debugged as the source is entered without <unk> or restarting the whole program . All syntactic elements , including variables and basic operators , are defined as words . Forth environments vary in how the resulting program is stored , but ideally running the program has the same effect as manually re @-@ entering the source . 
 = = = Stacks = = = 
 Most programming environments with recursive subroutines use a stack for control flow . This structure typically also stores local variables , including subroutine parameters ( in call by value system such as C ) . Forth often does not have local variables , however , nor is it call @-@ by @-@ value . Instead , intermediate values are kept in a second stack . Words operate directly on the topmost values in the first stack . It may therefore be called the " parameter " or " data " stack , but most often simply " the " stack . The second , function @-@ call stack is then called the " linkage " or " return " stack , abbreviated <unk> . Special <unk> manipulation functions provided by the kernel allow it to be used for temporary storage within a word , but otherwise it cannot be used to pass parameters or manipulate data . 
 Most words are specified in terms of their effect on the stack . Typically , parameters are placed on the top of the stack before the word executes . After execution , the parameters have been erased and replaced with any return values . For arithmetic operators , this follows the rule of reverse Polish notation . See below for examples illustrating stack usage . 
 = = = Maintenance = = = 
 Forth is a simple yet extensible language ; its modularity and <unk> permit the writing of high @-@ level programs such as CAD systems . Forth has been used successfully in large , complex projects , while applications developed by competent , disciplined professionals have proven to be easily maintained on evolving hardware platforms over decades of use . Forth has a niche both in astronomical and space applications . Forth is still used today in many embedded systems ( small computerized devices ) because of its portability , efficient memory use , short development time , and fast execution speed . It has been implemented efficiently on modern RISC processors , and processors that use Forth as machine language have been produced . Other uses of Forth include the Open Firmware boot ROMs used by Apple , IBM , Sun , and <unk> XO @-@ 1 ; and the <unk> @-@ based first stage boot controller of the FreeBSD operating system . 
 = = History = = 
 Forth evolved from Charles H. Moore 's personal programming system , which had been in continuous development since 1968 . Forth was first exposed to other programmers in the early 1970s , starting with Elizabeth Rather at the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory . After their work at <unk> , Charles Moore and Elizabeth Rather formed FORTH , Inc. in 1973 , refining and porting Forth systems to dozens of other platforms in the next decade . 
 Forth is so named because in 1968 " the file holding the interpreter was labeled <unk> , for 4th ( next ) generation software — but the IBM 1130 operating system restricted file names to 5 characters . " Moore saw Forth as a successor to compile @-@ link @-@ go third @-@ generation programming languages , or software for " fourth generation " hardware , not a fourth @-@ generation programming language as the term has come to be used . 
 Because Charles Moore frequently moved from job to job over his career , an early pressure on the developing language was ease of porting to different computer architectures . A Forth system has often been used to bring up new hardware . For example , Forth was the first resident software on the new Intel 8086 chip in 1978 and <unk> was the first resident development system for the first Apple Macintosh in 1984 . 
 FORTH , Inc . ' s <unk> was developed for the Intel 8080 , Motorola 6800 , and Zilog Z80 microprocessors starting in 1976 . <unk> was later used by hobbyists to generate Forth systems for other architectures , such as the 6502 in 1978 . Wide dissemination finally led to standardization of the language . Common practice was codified in the de facto standards FORTH @-@ 79 and FORTH @-@ 83 in the years 1979 and 1983 , respectively . These standards were unified by ANSI in 1994 , commonly referred to as ANS Forth . 
 Forth became very popular in the 1980s because it was well suited to the small microcomputers of that time , being compact and portable . At least one home computer , the British Jupiter ACE , had Forth in its ROM @-@ resident operating system . The Canon Cat also used Forth for its system programming , and Rockwell produced single @-@ chip microcomputers with resident Forth kernels , the <unk> and <unk> . A complete family tree is at TU @-@ Wien . <unk> <unk> was a version of Forth with graphics expansions for the Apple II . <unk> was a Forth expansion for measuring and controlling on PCs . 
 = = Programmer 's perspective = = 
 Forth relies heavily on explicit use of a data stack and reverse Polish notation ( RPN or postfix notation ) , commonly used in calculators from Hewlett @-@ Packard . In RPN , the operator is placed after its operands , as opposed to the more common infix notation where the operator is placed between its operands . <unk> notation makes the language easier to parse and extend ; Forth 's flexibility makes a static BNF grammar inappropriate , and it does not have a monolithic compiler . Extending the compiler only requires writing a new word , instead of modifying a grammar and changing the underlying implementation . 
 Using RPN , one could get the result of the mathematical expression ( 25 * 10 + 50 ) this way : 
 25 10 * 50 + CR . 
 300 ok 
 This command line first puts the numbers 25 and 10 on the implied stack . 
 The word * multiplies the two numbers on the top of the stack and replaces them with their product . 
 Then the number 50 is placed on the stack . 
 The word + adds it to the previous product . The CR moves the output to a new line ( it is only for formatting purposes and could be omitted but - in most implementations - without it the output would occur on the same line as the input and would be less readable in the example ) . Finally , the . command prints the result to the user 's terminal . As everything has completed successfully at that point , the text interpreter then outputs the prompt " ok " and moves to a new line to get more input without needing anything explicit to do that . 
 Even Forth 's structural features are stack @-@ based . For example : 
 : FLOOR5 ( n -- n ' ) DUP 6 < IF DROP 5 ELSE 1 - THEN ; 
 This code defines a new word ( again , word is the term used for a subroutine ) called FLOOR5 using the following commands : DUP duplicates the number on the stack ; 6 places a 6 on top of the stack ; < compares the top two numbers on the stack ( 6 and the <unk> input ) , and replaces them with a true @-@ or @-@ false value ; IF takes a true @-@ or @-@ false value and chooses to execute commands immediately after it or to skip to the ELSE ; DROP discards the value on the stack ; and THEN ends the conditional . The text in parentheses is a comment , advising that this word expects a number on the stack and will return a possibly changed number . The FLOOR5 word is equivalent to this function written in the C programming language using the ternary operator : 
 This function is written more succinctly as : 
 : FLOOR5 ( n -- n ' ) 1- 5 MAX ; 
 You could run this word as follows : 
 1 FLOOR5 CR . 
 5 ok 
 8 FLOOR5 CR . 
 7 ok 
 First the interpreter pushes a number ( 1 or 8 ) onto the stack , then it calls FLOOR5 , which pops off this number again and pushes the result . The CR moves the output to a new line ( again , this is only here for readability ) . Finally , a call to " . " pops the result and prints it to the user 's terminal . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 Forth has no explicit grammar . The interpreter reads a line of input from the user input device , which is then parsed for a word using spaces as a <unk> ; some systems recognise additional whitespace characters . When the interpreter finds a word , it looks the word up in the dictionary . If the word is found , the interpreter executes the code associated with the word , and then returns to parse the rest of the input stream . If the word isn 't found , the word is assumed to be a number and an attempt is made to convert it into a number and push it on the stack ; if successful , the interpreter continues parsing the input stream . Otherwise , if both the lookup and the number conversion fail , the interpreter prints the word followed by an error message indicating the word is not recognised , flushes the input stream , and waits for new user input . 
 The definition of a new word is started with the word : ( colon ) and ends with the word ; ( semi @-@ colon ) . For example , 
 : X DUP 1 + . . ; 
 will compile the word X , and makes the name findable in the dictionary . When executed by typing 10 X at the console this will print 11 10 . 
 Most Forth systems include an assembler that allows one to specify words using the processor 's facilities at its lowest level . Mostly the assembler is tucked away in a separate namespace ( wordlist ) as relatively few users want to use it . Forth assemblers may use a reverse @-@ polish syntax in which the parameters of an instruction precede the instruction , but designs vary widely and are specific to the Forth implementation . A typical reverse @-@ polish assembler prepares the operands on the stack and have the mnemonic copy the whole instruction into memory as the last step . A Forth assembler is by nature a macro assembler , so that it is easy to define an alias for registers according to their role in the Forth system : e.g. " <unk> " for the register used as a stack pointer . 
 = = = Operating system , files , and multitasking = = = 
 Most Forth systems run under a host operating system such as Microsoft Windows , Linux or a version of Unix and use the host operating system 's file system for source and data files ; the ANSI Forth Standard describes the words used for I / O. All modern Forth systems use normal text files for source , even if they are embedded . An embedded system with a resident compiler gets its source via a serial line . 
 Classic Forth systems traditionally use neither operating system nor file system . Instead of storing code in files , source code is stored in disk blocks written to physical disk addresses . The word <unk> is employed to translate the number of a 1K @-@ sized block of disk space into the address of a buffer containing the data , which is managed automatically by the Forth system . Block use has become rare since the mid @-@ 1990s . In a hosted system those blocks too are allocated in a normal file in any case . 
 Multitasking , most commonly cooperative round @-@ robin scheduling , is normally available ( although multitasking words and support are not covered by the ANSI Forth Standard ) . The word <unk> is used to save the current task 's execution context , to locate the next task , and restore its execution context . Each task has its own stacks , private copies of some control variables and a scratch area . Swapping tasks is simple and efficient ; as a result , Forth <unk> are available even on very simple <unk> , such as the Intel <unk> , <unk> AVR , and TI <unk> . 
 Other non @-@ standard facilities include a mechanism for issuing calls to the host OS or windowing systems , and many provide extensions that employ the scheduling provided by the operating system . Typically they have a larger and different set of words from the stand @-@ alone Forth 's <unk> word for task creation , suspension , destruction and modification of priority . 
 = = = Self @-@ compilation and cross compilation = = = 
 A fully featured Forth system with all source code will compile itself , a technique commonly called meta @-@ compilation by Forth programmers ( although the term doesn 't exactly match meta @-@ compilation as it is normally defined ) . The usual method is to redefine the handful of words that place compiled bits into memory . The compiler 's words use specially named versions of fetch and store that can be redirected to a buffer area in memory . The buffer area simulates or accesses a memory area beginning at a different address than the code buffer . Such compilers define words to access both the target computer 's memory , and the host ( compiling ) computer 's memory . 
 After the fetch and store operations are redefined for the code space , the compiler , assembler , etc. are recompiled using the new definitions of fetch and store . This effectively reuses all the code of the compiler and interpreter . Then , the Forth system 's code is compiled , but this version is stored in the buffer . The buffer in memory is written to disk , and ways are provided to load it temporarily into memory for testing . When the new version appears to work , it is written over the previous version . 
 Numerous variations of such compilers exist for different environments . For embedded systems , the code may instead be written to another computer , a technique known as cross compilation , over a serial port or even a single TTL bit , while keeping the word names and other non @-@ executing parts of the dictionary in the original compiling computer . The minimum definitions for such a Forth compiler are the words that fetch and store a byte , and the word that commands a Forth word to be executed . Often the most time @-@ consuming part of writing a remote port is constructing the initial program to implement fetch , store and execute , but many modern microprocessors have integrated debugging features ( such as the Motorola <unk> ) that eliminate this task . 
 = = Structure of the language = = 
 The basic data structure of Forth is the " dictionary " which maps " words " to executable code or named data structures . The dictionary is laid out in memory as a tree of linked lists with the links proceeding from the latest ( most recently ) defined word to the oldest , until a sentinel value , usually a NULL pointer , is found . A context switch causes a list search to start at a different leaf . A linked list search continues as the branch merges into the main trunk leading eventually back to the sentinel , the root . There can be several dictionaries . In rare cases such as meta @-@ compilation a dictionary might be isolated and stand @-@ alone . The effect resembles that of nesting namespaces and can overload keywords depending on the context . 
 A defined word generally consists of head and body with the head consisting of the name field ( NF ) and the link field ( LF ) and body consisting of the code field ( CF ) and the parameter field ( PF ) . 
 Head and body of a dictionary entry are treated separately because they may not be contiguous . For example , when a Forth program is recompiled for a new platform , the head may remain on the compiling computer , while the body goes to the new platform . In some environments ( such as embedded systems ) the heads occupy memory unnecessarily . However , some cross @-@ compilers may put heads in the target if the target itself is expected to support an interactive Forth . 
 = = = Dictionary entry = = = 
 The exact format of a dictionary entry is not prescribed , and implementations vary . However , certain components are almost always present , though the exact size and order may vary . Described as a structure , a dictionary entry might look this way : 
 structure 
 byte : flag \ <unk> flags + length of word 's name 
 char @-@ array : name \ name 's runtime length isn 't known at compile time 
 address : previous \ link field , backward ptr to previous word 
 address : codeword \ ptr to the code to execute this word 
 any @-@ array : <unk> \ unknown length of data , words , or <unk> 
 end @-@ structure <unk> 
 The name field starts with a prefix giving the length of the word 's name ( typically up to 32 bytes ) , and several bits for flags . The character representation of the word 's name then follows the prefix . Depending on the particular implementation of Forth , there may be one or more <unk> ( ' \ 0 ' ) bytes for alignment . 
 The link field contains a pointer to the previously defined word . The pointer may be a relative displacement or an absolute address that points to the next oldest sibling . 
 The code field pointer will be either the address of the word which will execute the code or data in the parameter field or the beginning of machine code that the processor will execute directly . For colon defined words , the code field pointer points to the word that will save the current Forth instruction pointer ( IP ) on the return stack , and load the IP with the new address from which to continue execution of words . This is the same as what a processor 's call / return instructions does . 
 = = = Structure of the compiler = = = 
 The compiler itself is not a monolithic program . It consists of Forth words visible to the system , and usable by a programmer . This allows a programmer to change the compiler 's words for special purposes . 
 The " compile time " flag in the name field is set for words with " compile time " behavior . Most simple words execute the same code whether they are typed on a command line , or embedded in code . When compiling these , the compiler simply places code or a threaded pointer to the word . 
 The classic examples of compile @-@ time words are the control structures such as IF and WHILE . Almost all of Forth 's control structures and almost all of its compiler are implemented as compile @-@ time words . Apart from some rarely used control flow words only found in a few implementations , such as a conditional return , all of Forth 's control flow words are executed during compilation to compile various combinations of primitive words along with their branch addresses . For instance , IF and WHILE , and the words that match with those , set up BRANCH ( unconditional branch ) and ? BRANCH ( pop a value off the stack , and branch if it is false ) . Counted loop control flow words work similarly but set up combinations of primitive words that work with a counter , and so on . During compilation , the data stack is used to support control structure balancing , nesting , and back @-@ patching of branch addresses . The snippet : 
 ... DUP 6 < IF DROP 5 ELSE 1 - THEN ... 
 would be compiled to the following sequence inside a definition : 
 ... DUP LIT 6 < ? BRANCH 5 DROP LIT 5 BRANCH 3 LIT 1 - ... 
 The numbers after BRANCH represent relative jump addresses . LIT is the primitive word for pushing a " literal " number onto the data stack . 
 = = = = Compilation state and interpretation state = = = = 
 The word : ( colon ) parses a name as a parameter , creates a dictionary entry ( a colon definition ) and enters compilation state . The interpreter continues to read space @-@ delimited words from the user input device . If a word is found , the interpreter executes the compilation semantics associated with the word , instead of the interpretation semantics . The default compilation semantics of a word are to append its interpretation semantics to the current definition . 
 The word ; ( semi @-@ colon ) finishes the current definition and returns to interpretation state . It is an example of a word whose compilation semantics differ from the default . The interpretation semantics of ; ( semi @-@ colon ) , most control flow words , and several other words are undefined in ANS Forth , meaning that they must only be used inside of definitions and not on the interactive command line . 
 The interpreter state can be changed manually with the words [ ( left @-@ bracket ) and ] ( right @-@ bracket ) which enter interpretation state or compilation state , respectively . These words can be used with the word LITERAL to calculate a value during a compilation and to insert the calculated value into the current colon definition . LITERAL has the compilation semantics to take an object from the data stack and to append semantics to the current colon definition to place that object on the data stack . 
 In ANS Forth , the current state of the interpreter can be read from the flag STATE which contains the value true when in compilation state and false otherwise . This allows the implementation of so @-@ called state @-@ smart words with behavior that changes according to the current state of the interpreter . 
 = = = = Immediate words = = = = 
 The word IMMEDIATE marks the most recent colon definition as an immediate word , effectively replacing its compilation semantics with its interpretation semantics . Immediate words are normally executed during compilation , not compiled but this can be overridden by the programmer , in either state . ; is an example of an immediate word . In ANS Forth , the word POSTPONE takes a name as a parameter and appends the compilation semantics of the named word to the current definition even if the word was marked immediate . Forth @-@ 83 defined separate words COMPILE and [ COMPILE ] to force the compilation of non @-@ immediate and immediate words , respectively . 
 = = = = Unnamed words and execution tokens = = = = 
 In ANS Forth , unnamed words can be defined with the word : <unk> which compiles the following words up to the next ; ( semi @-@ colon ) and leaves an execution token on the data stack . The execution token provides an opaque handle for the compiled semantics , similar to the function pointers of the C programming language . 
 Execution tokens can be stored in variables . The word <unk> takes an execution token from the data stack and performs the associated semantics . The word COMPILE , ( compile @-@ comma ) takes an execution token from the data stack and appends the associated semantics to the current definition . 
 The word ' ( tick ) takes the name of a word as a parameter and returns the execution token associated with that word on the data stack . In interpretation state , ' <unk> @-@ WORD <unk> is equivalent to <unk> @-@ WORD . 
 = = = = <unk> words and comments = = = = 
 The words : ( colon ) , POSTPONE , ' ( tick ) are examples of parsing words that take their arguments from the user input device instead of the data stack . Another example is the word ( ( paren ) which reads and ignores the following words up to and including the next right parenthesis and is used to place comments in a colon definition . Similarly , the word \ ( backslash ) is used for comments that continue to the end of the current line . To be parsed correctly , ( ( paren ) and \ ( backslash ) must be separated by whitespace from the following comment text . 
 = = = Structure of code = = = 
 In most Forth systems , the body of a code definition consists of either machine language , or some form of threaded code . The original Forth which follows the informal FIG standard ( Forth Interest Group ) , is a <unk> ( <unk> Interpretive Language ) . This is also called indirect @-@ threaded code , but direct @-@ threaded and subroutine threaded Forths have also become popular in modern times . The fastest modern Forths use subroutine threading , insert simple words as macros , and perform peephole optimization or other optimizing strategies to make the code smaller and faster . 
 = = = Data objects = = = 
 When a word is a variable or other data object , the CF points to the runtime code associated with the defining word that created it . A defining word has a characteristic " defining behavior " ( creating a dictionary entry plus possibly allocating and initializing data space ) and also specifies the behavior of an instance of the class of words constructed by this defining word . Examples include : 
 <unk> 
 Names an uninitialized , one @-@ cell memory location . Instance behavior of a <unk> returns its address on the stack . 
 CONSTANT 
 Names a value ( specified as an argument to CONSTANT ) . Instance behavior returns the value . 
 <unk> 
 Names a location ; space may be allocated at this location , or it can be set to contain a string or other initialized value . Instance behavior returns the address of the beginning of this space . 
 Forth also provides a facility by which a programmer can define new application @-@ specific defining words , specifying both a custom defining behavior and instance behavior . Some examples include circular buffers , named bits on an I / O port , and automatically indexed arrays . 
 Data objects defined by these and similar words are global in scope . The function provided by local variables in other languages is provided by the data stack in Forth ( although Forth also has real local variables ) . Forth programming style uses very few named data objects compared with other languages ; typically such data objects are used to contain data which is used by a number of words or tasks ( in a <unk> implementation ) . 
 Forth does not enforce consistency of data type usage ; it is the programmer 's responsibility to use appropriate operators to fetch and store values or perform other operations on data . 
 = = Programming = = 
 Words written in Forth are compiled into an executable form . The classical " indirect threaded " implementations compile lists of addresses of words to be executed in turn ; many modern systems generate actual machine code ( including calls to some external words and code for others expanded in place ) . Some systems have optimizing compilers . Generally speaking , a Forth program is saved as the memory image of the compiled program with a single command ( e.g. , RUN ) that is executed when the compiled version is loaded . 
 During development , the programmer uses the interpreter in <unk> mode to execute and test each little piece as it is developed . Most Forth programmers therefore advocate a loose top @-@ down design , and bottom @-@ up development with continuous testing and integration . 
 The top @-@ down design is usually separation of the program into " vocabularies " that are then used as high @-@ level sets of tools to write the final program . A well @-@ designed Forth program reads like natural language , and implements not just a single solution , but also sets of tools to attack related problems . 
 = = Code examples = = 
 = = = Hello world = = = 
 One possible implementation : 
 : HELLO ( -- ) CR . " Hello , world ! " ; 
 HELLO < cr > 
 Hello , world ! 
 The word CR ( Carriage Return ) causes the following output to be displayed on a new line . The parsing word . " ( dot @-@ quote ) reads a double @-@ quote delimited string and appends code to the current definition so that the parsed string will be displayed on execution . The space character separating the word . " from the string Hello , world ! is not included as part of the string . It is needed so that the parser recognizes . " as a Forth word . 
 A standard Forth system is also an interpreter , and the same output can be obtained by typing the following code fragment into the Forth console : 
 CR . ( Hello , world ! ) 
 . ( ( dot @-@ paren ) is an immediate word that parses a parenthesis @-@ delimited string and displays it . As with the word . " the space character separating . ( from Hello , world ! is not part of the string . 
 The word CR comes before the text to print . By convention , the Forth interpreter does not start output on a new line . Also by convention , the interpreter waits for input at the end of the previous line , after an ok prompt . There is no implied " flush @-@ buffer " action in Forth 's CR , as sometimes is in other programming languages . 
 = = = Mixing states of compiling and interpreting = = = 
 Here is the definition of a word EMIT @-@ Q which when executed emits the single character Q : 
 : EMIT @-@ Q 81 ( the ASCII value for the character ' Q ' ) EMIT ; 
 This definition was written to use the ASCII value of the Q character ( 81 ) directly . The text between the parentheses is a comment and is ignored by the compiler . The word EMIT takes a value from the data stack and displays the corresponding character . 
 The following redefinition of EMIT @-@ Q uses the words [ ( left @-@ bracket ) , ] ( right @-@ bracket ) , CHAR and LITERAL to temporarily switch to interpreter state , calculate the ASCII value of the Q character , return to compilation state and append the calculated value to the current colon definition : 
 : EMIT @-@ Q [ CHAR Q ] LITERAL EMIT ; 
 The parsing word CHAR takes a space @-@ delimited word as parameter and places the value of its first character on the data stack . The word [ CHAR ] is an immediate version of CHAR . Using [ CHAR ] , the example definition for EMIT @-@ Q could be rewritten like this : 
 : EMIT @-@ Q [ CHAR ] Q EMIT ; \ Emit the single character ' <unk> 
 This definition used \ ( backslash ) for the describing comment . 
 Both CHAR and [ CHAR ] are predefined in ANS Forth . Using IMMEDIATE and POSTPONE , [ CHAR ] could have been defined like this : 
 : [ CHAR ] CHAR POSTPONE LITERAL ; IMMEDIATE

 In 1987 , Ron <unk> developed the <unk> cipher @-@ system for RSA Data Security , Inc . The code is extremely simple and can be written by most programmers from the description : 
 We have an array of 256 bytes , all different . Every time the array is used it changes by swapping two bytes . The swaps are controlled by counters i and j , each initially 0 . To get a new i , add 1 . To get a new j , add the array byte at the new i . Exchange the array bytes at i and j . The code is the array byte at the sum of the array bytes at i and j . This is <unk> with a byte of the plaintext to encrypt , or the ciphertext to decrypt . The array is initialized by first setting it to 0 through 255 . Then step through it using i and j , getting the new j by adding to it the array byte at i and a key byte , and swapping the array bytes at i and j . Finally , i and j are set to 0 . All additions are modulo 256 . 
 The following Standard Forth version uses Core and Core Extension words only .

It is considered to be a southern extension of U.S. Route 206 ( US 206 ) , running 11 @.@ 86 mi ( 19 @.@ 09 km ) from an intersection with US 206 and US 30 in Hammonton to an intersection with US 40 in Buena Vista Township . The road passes through the center of Hammonton before running into rural areas . It intersects US 322 and Route 73 in Folsom and the Atlantic City Expressway in Hammonton . 
 What is now Route 54 was originally legislated in 1938 to run from US 30 / US 206 in Hammonton south to Main Road in Landis Township ( part of present @-@ day Vineland ) . The only part taken over as a state highway and designated Route 54 was north of US 40 in Buena , the proposed route south of this point remained as county @-@ maintained Lincoln Avenue . In 1953 , Route 54 was defined onto its current alignment . A freeway was proposed along the Route 54 corridor in the late 1960s to connect the southern terminus of US 206 in Hammonton to Route 55 in the Vineland / Millville area ; it was eventually canceled .

 Route 54 begins at an intersection with US 40 / County Route 557 ( CR 557 ) and CR 619 on the border of Buena and Buena Vista Township . Known as Buena Hammonton Road , it proceeds north @-@ northeast as a two @-@ lane undivided road through agricultural areas , forming the border between Buena to the west and Buena Vista Township to the east . After fully entering Buena Vista Township and becoming 12th Street , the road reaches an intersection with CR 690 and makes a turn more to the northeast . At this point , Route 54 enters forested areas , with a few breaks for residences . Upon entering Folsom , the route passes over a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line before coming to a cloverleaf interchange with US 322 ( Black Horse Pike ) . After this interchange , the road comes to a crossroads with Route 73 , which is signed as County Route 561 Spur . Following this intersection , Route 54 heads through a mix of woods and farm fields as it enters Hammonton and reaches an interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway . In the area of this interchange , the route is a four @-@ lane divided highway . 
 Past the Atlantic City Expressway , the two @-@ lane undivided road comes to an intersection with CR 559 . From this point , Route 54 is lined with residences and businesses as it comes into downtown Hammonton . The road crosses New Jersey Transit ’ s Atlantic City Line immediately before a junction with CR 561 . After CR 561 , the route becomes Bellevue Avenue and encounters the western terminus of CR 542 . As the road leaves the downtown area , the surroundings become more residential . Route 54 ends at an intersection with US 30 and US 206 , where the road continues north as US 206 .

 By 1927 , what is now Route 54 was an unnumbered , unpaved road connecting Buena to Hammonton . Route 54 was legislated in 1938 to run from US 30 / Route 43 and US 206 / Route 39 in Hammonton south along Lincoln Avenue to an intersection with Main Road in Landis Township , Cumberland County ( now a part of Vineland ) . The only portion of Route 54 that was taken over as a state highway was north of the US 40 / Route 48 intersection in Buena . The portion of Lincoln Avenue south of US 40 remained a county route called CR 25 in Cumberland County and CR 55 and CR 19 in Atlantic County . This road is presently both Cumberland and Atlantic CRs 655 and a part of Atlantic CR 619 . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 54 was defined onto its current alignment between US 40 in Buena Vista and US 30 / US 206 in Hammonton . In the late 1960s , a freeway was proposed for the US 206 / Route 54 corridor , running from US 30 in Hammonton south to Route 55 and the proposed Route 60 near Vineland and Millville . The freeway between Vineland / Millville and Hammonton was to cost $ 47 million and was intended to provide a better route between the two areas than the existing two @-@ lane roads . This proposed freeway was never built due to environmental and financial issues .

 = SMS Hamburg = 
 SMS Hamburg ( " His Majesty 's Ship Hamburg " ) was the second of seven Bremen @-@ class cruisers of the Imperial German Navy , named after the city of Hamburg . She was begun by AG Vulcan Stettin in Stettin in 1902 , launched on 25 July 1903 and commissioned on 8 March 1904 . Throughout her over 40 @-@ year long career , she served with the Imperial Navy , the Reichsmarine , and the Kriegsmarine . Armed with a main battery of ten 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and two 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , Hamburg was capable of a top speed of 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . 
 Hamburg served with the High Seas Fleet for the first eight years on active duty . For the rest of her career , she served with U @-@ boat flotillas , first as a flagship for the I U @-@ boat Flotilla and later as a barracks ship for U @-@ boat crews during World War I. she returned to fleet duty with the Reichsmarine after the end of the war , but returned to barracks ship duties starting in 1936 , though 1944 . She was towed to her namesake city in early July 1944 for scrapping , but was sunk by British bombers toward the end of the month . The wreck was raised in 1949 and subsequently dismantled in 1956 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Hamburg was ordered under the contract name " K " and was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1902 and launched on 25 July 1903 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 8 March 1904 . The ship was 111 @.@ 1 meters ( 365 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 13 @.@ 3 m ( 44 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 28 m ( 17 @.@ 3 ft ) forward . She displaced 3 @,@ 651 t ( 3 @,@ 593 long tons ; 4 @,@ 025 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two triple @-@ expansion engines , designed to give 10 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) for a top speed of 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . The engines were powered by ten coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers . Hamburg carried up to 860 tonnes ( 850 long tons ) of coal , which gave her a range of 4 @,@ 270 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 910 km ; 4 @,@ 910 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . She had a crew of 14 officers and 274 – 287 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 40 guns in single mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , six were located amidships , three on either side , and two were placed side by side aft . The guns could engage targets out to 12 @,@ 200 m ( 40 @,@ 000 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 500 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . She was also equipped with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes . They were submerged in the hull on the broadside . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides , and the guns were protected by 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick shields .

 After her commissioning , Hamburg served with the fleet . She was assigned to I Subdivision of the Cruiser Division of the Active Fleet . The unit consisted of the light cruisers Frauenlob and Arcona and the armored cruiser Friedrich Carl , the flagship . The ships were attached to the I Squadron of the Active Fleet . A second subdivision , composed of an armored cruiser and three light cruisers was attached to the II Squadron . In April 1909 , Hamburg was cruising in the Mediterranean . On 21 April , she was dispatched from Corfu to Mersin , where rioting threatened German interests . She was joined there the following day by several British and French warships , including the battleship HMS Swiftsure . By 1912 , she was withdrawn from front @-@ line service for use as the second command flagship for the I U @-@ boat Flotilla . After the outbreak of World War I , she rejoined the fleet , but continued in her role as the I Flotilla flagship . On 6 August , she and the cruiser Stettin escorted a flotilla of U @-@ boats into the North Sea in an attempt to draw out the British fleet , which could then be attacked by the U @-@ boats . The force returned to port on 11 August , without having encountered any British warships . 
 On 15 – 16 December , Hamburg participated in the bombardment of Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby . She was assigned to the cruiser screen of the High Seas Fleet , which was providing distant cover to Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper 's battlecruisers while they were conducting the bombardment . Following reports of British destroyers from Hamburg and the armored cruiser Roon , Admiral von Ingenohl ordered the High Seas Fleet to turn to port and head for Germany . At 06 : 59 , Hamburg , Roon , and Stuttgart encountered Commander Jones ' destroyers . Jones shadowed the Germans until 07 : 40 , at which point Hamburg and Stuttgart were detached to sink their pursuers . At 08 : 02 , Roon signaled the two light cruisers and ordered them to abandon the pursuit and retreat along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet . 
 Hamburg was assigned to the IV Scouting Group during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . The IV Scouting Group , under the command of Commodore Ludwig von Reuter , departed Wilhelmshaven at 03 : 30 on 31 May , along with the rest of the fleet . Tasked with screening for the fleet , Hamburg and the torpedo boat V73 were positioned on the port side of the fleet , abreast of the II Battle Squadron . Hamburg and the IV Scouting Group were not heavily engaged during the early phases of the battle , but around 21 : 30 , they encountered the British 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron ( 3rd LCS ) . Reuter 's ships were leading the High Seas Fleet south , away from the deployed Grand Fleet . Due to the long range and poor visibility , only München and Stettin were able to engage the British cruisers . Hamburg only fired one salvo , since the haze rendered it impossible to spot the fall of shot . Reuter turned his ships hard to starboard , in order to draw the British closer to the capital ships of the German fleet , but the 3rd LCS refused to take the bait and disengaged . 
 Later in the war , Hamburg was reduced to a barracks ship for the U @-@ boat flotilla in Wilhelmshaven . During this period , among others , her commanding officers was Korvettenkapitän Friedrich Lützow , who commanded Hamburg from 16 March 1917 to 12 May 1918 . She was among the six light cruisers Germany was permitted to retain by the Treaty of Versailles . In the service of the newly reorganized Reichsmarine , Hamburg served in the active fleet starting in 1920 . In 1922 , Hamburg was assigned to the North Sea Squadron , with the old battleship Braunschweig and the cruiser Arcona . She remained in the fleet until 1923 , when she was withdrawn from active service for use as a training cruiser for naval cadets . She served in this capacity from 1924 to 1927 ; she remained in the Reichsmarine inventory until she was stricken from the naval register on 31 March 1931 . Promoted to Kapitän zur See , Lützow again served as her commander form 27 September 1924 to 2 May 1925 . She was again used as a barracks ship for submarine crews starting in 1936 by the Kriegsmarine , this time in Kiel . She continued in this duty until 1944 , when the Kriegsmarine decided to break her up for scrap . She was towed to her namesake city on 7 July 1944 for dismantling , where she was later sunk by British bombers on 27 July . The wreck was raised in 1949 and ultimately broken up in 1956 .

He 's done a nice job when he 's been in there . " 
 Mitchell began the season as the team 's fourth wide receiver behind Thrash , Pinkston , and Na Brown .

 After the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman to a one @-@ year contract in August 2002 , Mitchell was demoted to the fourth wide receiver behind Pinkston , Thrash , and Freeman . Mitchell mainly contributed on special teams for the Eagles throughout the 2002 season . In the first fifteen weeks of the season , Mitchell caught a total of six passes for 53 yards as a backup . Against the Cowboys in week sixteen , Pinkston left the game due to turf toe , and Mitchell caught two passes for 17 yards in his place . Mitchell started in place of Pinkston in the last regular season game against the Giants on December 28 , and led the team in receiving with four catches for 35 yards . 
 Mitchell only caught twelve passes for 105 yards over the entire season . It was after this dismal performance , despite having the benefit of Pro Bowl quarterback Donovan McNabb passing to him , that Mitchell began to be labeled as a " bust . "

 Mitchell competed with rookie Billy McMullen for the third wide receiver position in 2003 after Freeman left the Eagles following the 2002 season . He eventually beat out McMullen for the slot receiver job . Eagles staff , players , and media called Mitchell one of the most improved players in training camp . Donovan McNabb commented that Mitchell 's " offseason workouts as well as his mindset has been a whole lot different . " 
 In the first four weeks of the season , Mitchell caught six passes for 55 yards . Mitchell had one catch for 29 yards against the Redskins on October 5 , and he recovered a Redskins onside kick to clinch the win for the Eagles .

Against the New York Jets in week eight , he had two catches for 29 yards .

Against the San Francisco 49ers in week sixteen on December 21 , Mitchell made two catches for 23 yards and caught an eight @-@ yard touchdown pass in the second quarter of a week seventeen game against the Redskins on December 27 . He had four catches for 47 yards in the game . 
 Mitchell 's most significant play , according to Philadelphia media and fans , came on January 11 , 2004 , in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Packers . Late in the game , with the Eagles losing by three points and facing a 4th and 26 situation , Mitchell caught a 28 @-@ yard pass for a first down . The Eagles tied the score on the same drive and won the game in overtime . Mitchell had another catch for nine yards in the game . In the NFC Championship Game on January 18 against the Carolina Panthers , he caught four passes for 38 yards in the loss . Mitchell had 35 catches for 498 yards and two touchdowns in 2003 .

 With the Eagles ' acquisition of wide receiver Terrell Owens and the departure of Thrash , Mitchell kept his role as the slot receiver in 2004 . Peter King said Mitchell had " a great training camp " and that he " might be having the best camp of any player I 've seen this summer . " He made seven receptions in the first four weeks of the season for a total of 118 yards receiving , including three catches for 71 yards against the Detroit Lions in week three . He started against the Panthers on October 17 in week six but did not record any catches . In the following three weeks , Mitchell only had two receptions for 31 yards , with both catches coming against the Cleveland Browns in week seven . His most notable catch of the season was a 60 @-@ yard reception during the Eagles ' November 15 , 2004 , Monday Night Football game against the Cowboys . This catch is remembered primarily for the manner in which McNabb extended the play by eluding the Cowboys ' pass rush for 14 @.@ 1 seconds before eventually throwing to Mitchell . Over the subsequent four weeks , Mitchell had one reception in each game for a combined 54 yards . He began to openly voice his frustration over the limited role he continued to play in the Eagles ' offense due to Owens ' prominence . At one point during the season , after he made a catch , Mitchell would point to his wrist as if to say " it 's about time . " In a week fifteen game against the Cowboys , Owens suffered an ankle injury and was expected to miss the remainder of the season . Mitchell , who suffered a quad contusion during the game , did not make a catch against Dallas , but was named the starter in Owens ' place opposite Pinkston . Against the Rams in week sixteen , Mitchell caught a seven @-@ yard touchdown pass from McNabb in the first quarter and finished the game with two receptions for 28 yards . In the final game of the regular season against the Cincinnati Bengals , Mitchell had six receptions for 76 yards and a touchdown . He finished the season with only 22 catches . 
 In a divisional playoff game against the Vikings on January 16 , 2005 , Mitchell caught a two @-@ yard touchdown pass in the first quarter and celebrated by feigning to pull his pants up , a reference to the touchdown celebration by Vikings ' wide receiver Randy Moss , who pretended to pull his pants down to moon Green Bay fans the week before and was heavily criticized for doing so . Mitchell recovered an L. J. Smith fumble in the endzone for a touchdown in the second quarter , and finished the game with a team @-@ high five receptions for 65 yards . In a press conference after the game , Mitchell said , " I just want to thank my hands for being so great . " He had two receptions for 20 yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game on January 23 . In the game , Mitchell sported a well @-@ publicized <unk> .

 The Eagles finished the 2004 season with a 13 – 3 record and earned a trip to Super Bowl XXXIX , where they were to play the AFC Champion New England Patriots . During the week leading up to the game , Mitchell sat for a short ESPN interview conducted by Dan Patrick . Asked to identify the members of the Patriots ' secondary , Mitchell claimed he did not know them by name , only by number , and then deliberately stated each of their numbers incorrectly . Finally , he said he " had something " for safety Rodney Harrison . Harrison responded by calling Mitchell a " jerk . " Normally tight @-@ lipped coach Patriots head coach Bill Belichick later said of Mitchell , " [ a ] ll he does is talk . He 's terrible , and you can print that . I was happy when he was in the game . " Mitchell caught only one pass for 11 yards in the 24 – 21 loss . After the Super Bowl , Mitchell continued to sound off in interviews in which he criticized the Patriots , as well as Belichick , saying that the way the Patriots reacted reminded him of " little girls . "

 Wendell Hampton Ford ( September 8 , 1924 – January 22 , 2015 ) was an American politician from the Commonwealth of Kentucky . He served for twenty @-@ four years in the U.S. Senate and was the 53rd Governor of Kentucky . He was the first person to be successively elected lieutenant governor , governor and United States senator in Kentucky history . The Senate Democratic whip from 1991 to 1999 , he was considered the leader of the state 's Democratic Party from his election to governor in 1971 until his retirement from the Senate in 1999 . At the time of his retirement , he was the longest @-@ serving senator in Kentucky 's history , a mark which was then surpassed by Mitch McConnell in 2009 . 
 Born in Daviess County , Kentucky , Ford attended the University of Kentucky , but his studies were interrupted by his service in World War II . After the war , he graduated from the Maryland School of Insurance and returned to Kentucky to help his father with the family insurance business . He also continued his military service in the Kentucky Army National Guard . He worked on the gubernatorial campaign of Bert T. Combs in 1959 , and became Combs ' executive assistant when Combs was elected governor . Encouraged to run for the Kentucky Senate by Combs ' ally and successor , Ned Breathitt , Ford won the seat and served one four @-@ year term before running for lieutenant governor in 1967 . He was elected on a split ticket with Republican Louie B. Nunn . Four years later , Ford defeated Combs in an upset in the Democratic primary en route to the governorship . 
 As governor , Ford made government more efficient by reorganizing and consolidating some departments in the executive branch . He raised revenue for the state through a severance tax on coal and enacted reforms to the educational system . He purged most of the Republicans from statewide office , including helping Walter " Dee " Huddleston win the Senate seat vacated by the retirement of Republican stalwart John Sherman Cooper . In 1974 , Ford himself ousted the other incumbent senator , Republican Marlow Cook . Following the rapid rise of Ford and many of his political allies , he and his lieutenant governor , Julian Carroll , were investigated on charges of political corruption , but a grand jury refused to indict them . As senator , Ford was a staunch defender of Kentucky 's tobacco industry . He also formed the Senate National Guard Caucus with Missouri senator Kit Bond . Chosen as Democratic party whip in 1991 , Ford considered running for floor leader in 1994 before throwing his support to Connecticut 's Christopher Dodd . He retired from the Senate in 1999 and returned to Owensboro , where he taught politics to youth at the Owensboro Museum of Science and History . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Wendell Ford was born near Owensboro , in Daviess County , Kentucky , on September 8 , 1924 . He was the son of Ernest M. and Irene <unk> ( Schenk ) Ford . His father was a state senator and ally of Kentucky Governor Earle C. Clements . Ford obtained his early education in the public schools of Daviess County and graduated from Daviess County High School . From 1942 to 1943 , he attended the University of Kentucky . 
 On September 18 , 1943 , Ford married Jean Neel of Owensboro at the home of the bride 's parents . The couple had two children . Daughter Shirley ( Ford ) Dexter was born in 1950 and son Steven Ford was born in 1954 . The family attended First Baptist Church in Owensboro . 
 In 1944 , Ford left the University of Kentucky to join the army , enlisting for service in World War II on July 22 , 1944 . He was trained as an administrative non @-@ commissioned officer and promoted to the rank of technical sergeant on November 17 , 1945 . Over the course of his service , he received the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal and earned the Expert Infantryman Badge and Good Conduct Medal . He was honorably discharged on June 18 , 1946 . 
 Following the war , Ford returned home to work with his father in the family insurance business , and graduated from the Maryland School of Insurance in 1947 . On June 7 , 1949 , he enlisted in the Kentucky Army National Guard and was assigned to Company I of the 149th Infantry Regimental Combat Team in Owensboro . On August 7 , 1949 , he was promoted to Second Lieutenant of Infantry . In 1949 , Ford 's company was converted from infantry to tanks , and Ford served as a Company Commander in the 240th Tank Battalion . Promoted to First Lieutenant of Armor , he transferred to the inactive Guard in 1956 , before being discharged in 1962 . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Ford was very active in civic affairs , becoming the first Kentuckian to serve as president of the Jaycees in 1954 . He was a youth chairman of Bert T. Combs ' 1959 gubernatorial campaign . After Combs ' election , Ford served as Combs ' executive assistant from 1959 to 1963 . When his mother died in 1963 , Ford returned to Owensboro to help his father with the family insurance agency . Although it was speculated he would run for lieutenant governor that year , Ford later insisted he had decided not to re @-@ enter politics until Governor Ned Breathitt asked him to run against Casper " Cap " Gardner , the state senate 's majority leader and a major obstacle to Breathitt 's progressive legislative agenda . Ford won the 1965 election by only 305 votes but quickly became a key player in the state senate . Representing the Eighth District , including Daviess and Hancock counties , Ford introduced 22 major pieces of legislation that became law during his single term in the senate . 
 In 1967 , Ford ran for lieutenant governor , this time against the wishes of Breathitt and Combs , whose pick was state attorney general Robert Matthews . Ford defeated Matthews by 631 votes , 0 @.@ 2 % of the total vote count in the primary . He ran an independent campaign and won in the general election even as Combs @-@ Breathitt pick Henry Ward lost the race for governor to Republican Louie B. Nunn . Republicans and Democrats split the state offices , with five going to Republicans and four going to Democrats . 
 During his time as lieutenant governor , Ford rebuilt the state 's Democratic machine , which would help elect him and others , including Senator Walter Huddleston and Governor Martha Layne Collins . When Governor Nunn asked the legislature to increase the state sales tax in 1968 from 3 percent to 5 percent , Ford opposed the measure , saying it should only pass if food and medicine were exempted . Ford lost this battle ; the increase passed without exemptions . From 1970 to 1971 , Ford was a member of the Executive Committee of the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors . 
 = = = Governor of Kentucky = = = 
 At the expiration of his term as lieutenant governor , Ford was one of eight candidates to enter the 1971 Democratic gubernatorial primary . The favorite of the field was Ford 's mentor , Combs . During the campaign , Ford attacked Combs ' age and the sales tax enacted during Combs ' administration . He also questioned why Combs would leave his better @-@ paying federal judgeship to run for a second term as governor . Ford garnered more votes than Combs and the other six candidates combined , and attributed his unlikely win over Combs in the primary to superior strategy and Combs ' underestimation of his candidacy . Following the election , Combs correctly predicted " This is the end of the road for me politically . " 
 Ford went on to win the governorship in a four @-@ way general election that included another former Democratic governor , A. B. " Happy " Chandler , who ran as an independent . Ford finished more than 58 @,@ 000 votes ahead of his closest rival , Republican Tom Emberton . With Combs and Chandler out of politics , factionalism in the Kentucky Democratic Party began to wane . 
 As governor , Ford raised revenue from a severance tax on coal , a two @-@ cent @-@ per @-@ gallon tax on gasoline , and an increased corporate tax . He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax . The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects . His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County , and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center . He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state 's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term . 
 Ford oversaw the transition of the University of Louisville from municipal to state funding . He pushed for reforms to the state 's education system , giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards . These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state 's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments . He increased funding to the state 's education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council on Higher Education . He vetoed a measure that would have allowed collective bargaining for teachers . 
 Ford drew praise for his attention to the mundane task of improving the efficiency and organization of executive departments , creating several " super cabinets " under which many departments were consolidated . During the 1972 legislative session , he created the Department of Finance and Administration , combining the functions of the Kentucky Program Development Office and the Department of Finance . Constitutional limits sometimes prevented him from combining like functions , but Ford made the reorganization a top priority and realized some savings to the state . 
 On March 21 , 1972 , the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its ruling in the case of Dunn v. Blumstein that found that a citizen who had lived in a state for 30 days was resident in that state and thus eligible to vote there . Kentucky 's Constitution required residency of one year in the state , six months in the county had and sixty days in the precinct to establish voting eligibility . This issue had to be resolved before the 1972 presidential election in November , so Ford called a special legislative session to enact the necessary corrections . In addition , Ford added to the General Assembly 's agenda the creation of a state environmental protection agency , a refinement of congressional districts in line with the latest census figures and ratification of the recently passed Equal Rights Amendment . All of these measures passed . 
 Despite surgery for a brain aneurysm in June 1972 , Ford attended the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach , Florida . He supported Edmund Muskie for president , but later greeted nominee George McGovern when he visited Kentucky . The convention was the beginning of Ford 's role in national politics . Offended by the McGovern campaign 's treatment of Democratic finance chairman Robert Schwarz Strauss , he helped Strauss get elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee following McGovern 's defeat . As a result of his involvement in Strauss ' election , Ford was elected chair of the Democratic Governors ' Conference from 1973 to 1974 . He also served as vice @-@ chair of the Conference 's Natural Resources and Environmental Management Committee . 
 During the 1974 legislative session , Ford proposed a six @-@ year study of coal liquefaction and gasification in response to the 1973 oil crisis . He also increased funding to human resources and continued his reorganization of the executive branch , creating cabinets for transportation , development , education and the arts , human resources , consumer protection and regulation , safety and justice . He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing state officials hired by the previous administration , and expanded the state merit system to cover some previously exempt state workers . Despite the expansion , he was criticized for the replacements he made , particularly that of the state personnel commissioner appointed during the Nunn administration . Critics also cited the fact that employees found qualified by the merit examination were still required to obtain political clearance before they were hired . 
 Ford united the state 's Democratic Party , allowing them to capture a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1972 for the first time since 1956 . The seat was vacated by the retirement of Republican John Sherman Cooper and won by Ford 's campaign manager , Walter " Dee " Huddleston . Ford 's friends then began lobbying him to try and unseat Kentucky 's other Republican senator , one @-@ term legislator Marlow Cook . Ford wanted lieutenant governor Julian Carroll , who had run on an informal slate with Combs in the 1971 primary , to run for Cook 's seat , but Carroll already had his eye on the governor 's chair . Ford 's allies did not have a gubernatorial candidate stronger than Carroll , and when a poll showed that Ford was the only Democrat who could defeat Cook , he agreed to run , announcing his candidacy immediately following the 1974 legislative session . 
 A primary issue during the election was the construction of a dam on the Red River . Cook opposed the dam , but Ford supported it and allocated some of the state 's budget surplus to its construction . In the election , Ford defeated Cook by a vote of 399 @,@ 406 to 328 @,@ 982 , completing his revitalization of the state 's Democratic party by personally ousting the last Republican from major office . Cook resigned his seat in December so that Ford would have a higher standing in seniority in the Senate . Ford resigned as governor to accept the seat , leaving the governorship to Carroll , who dropped state support for the project , killing it . 
 In the wake of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state 's major political offices , he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe . The four @-@ year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state insurance kickback scheme alleged to have operated during Ford 's tenure . In June 1972 , Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without competitive bidding . State law did not require competitive bidding , and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices . Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government contracts split commissions with party officials , although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than personal financial gain . In 1981 , prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on racketeering charges but a grand jury refused . Because grand jury proceedings are secret , what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed . However , state Republicans maintained that Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand , invoking his right against self @-@ incrimination . Ford refused to confirm or deny this report . A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be indicted in connection with the insurance scheme , but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation . 
 = = = United States Senate = = = 
 Ford entered the Senate in 1974 and was reelected in 1980 , 1986 and 1992 . In the 1980 primary , Ford received only token opposition from attorney Flora Stuart . He was unopposed in the 1986 and 1992 Democratic primaries . Republicans failed to put forward a viable challenger during any of Ford 's re @-@ election bids . In 1980 , he defeated septuagenarian former state auditor Mary Louise Foust by 334 @,@ 862 votes . Ford 's 720 @,@ 891 votes represented 65 percent of the total votes cast in the election , a record for a statewide race in Kentucky . Against Republican Jackson Andrews IV in 1986 , Ford shattered that record , securing 74 percent of the votes cast and carrying all 120 Kentucky counties . State senator David L. Williams fared little better in 1992 , surrendering 477 @,@ 002 votes to Ford ( 63 percent ) . 
 Ford seriously considered leaving the Senate and running for governor again in 1983 and 1991 , but decided against it both times . In the 1983 contest , he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary . Collins was a factional ally of Ford 's , which influenced his decision . In 1991 , Ford cited his seniority in the Senate and desire to become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor . 
 Early in his career , Ford supported a constitutional amendment against desegregation busing . He also floated a proposal to put the federal budget on a two @-@ year cycle , believing too much time was spent annually on budget wrangling . This idea , based on the model used in the Kentucky state budget , was never implemented . During the Ninety @-@ fifth Congress ( 1977 – 1979 ) , he was chairman of the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences . 
 From 1977 to 1983 , Ford was a member of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee . He first sought the post of Democratic whip in 1988 , but lost to California 's Alan Cranston , who had held the post since 1977 . Ford got a late start in the race , and a New York Times writer opined that he overestimated his chances of unseating Cranston . Immediately after conceding his loss , he announced he would be a candidate for the position in the next election in 1990 . He again faced Cranston in the election , but Cranston withdrew from the race due to a battle with prostate cancer . Ford maintained that he had enough commitments of support in the Democratic caucus to have won without Cranston 's withdrawal . When majority leader George J. Mitchell retired from the Senate in 1994 , Ford showed some interest in the Democratic floor leader post . Ultimately , he decided against it , choosing to focus instead on Kentucky issues . He supported Christopher Dodd for majority leader . 
 During the Ninety @-@ eighth Congress ( 1983 – 1985 ) , Ford served on the Select Committee to Study the Committee System , and he was a member of the Committee on Rules and Administration in the One Hundredth through One Hundred Third Congresses ( 1987 – 1995 ) . In 1989 , he joined with Missouri senator Kit Bond to form the Senate National Guard Caucus , a coalition of senators committed to advancing National Guard capabilities and readiness . Ford said he was motivated to form the caucus after seeing the work done by Mississippi Representative Sonny Montgomery with the National Guard Association and the National Guard Bureau . Ford co @-@ chaired the caucus with Bond until Ford 's retirement from the Senate in 1999 . The Kentucky Army Guard dedicated the Wendell H. Ford Training Center in Muhlenberg County , Kentucky in 1998 . In 1999 , the National Guard Bureau presented Ford with the Sonny Montgomery Award , its highest honor . 
 Missouri senator Thomas Eagleton opined that Ford and Dee Huddleston made " probably the best one @-@ two combination for any state in the Senate . " Both were defenders of tobacco , Kentucky 's primary cash crop . Ford sat on the Commerce Committee , influencing legislation affecting the manufacturing end of the tobacco industry , while Huddleston sat on the Agriculture Committee and protected programs that benefited tobacco farmers . Both were instrumental in salvaging the Tobacco Price Support Program . Ford got tobacco exempted from the Consumer Product Safety Act and was a consistent opponent of cigarette tax increases . He sponsored an amendment to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that limited the amount of foreign tobacco that could be imported by the United States . 
 Later in his career , Ford split with Huddleston 's successor , Mitch McConnell , over a proposed settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies . Ford favored the package as presented to Congress , which would have protected the price support program , while McConnell favored a smaller aid package to tobacco farmers and an end to the price support program . Both proposals were ultimately defeated , and the rift between Ford and McConnell never healed . 
 As chairman of the Commerce Committee 's aviation subcommittee , Ford secured funds to improve the airports in Louisville , northern Kentucky , and Glasgow . The Wendell H. Ford Airport in Hazard , Kentucky is named for him . A 1990 bill aimed at reducing aircraft noise , improving airline safety measures , and requiring airlines to better inform consumers about their performance was dubbed the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century . 
 Of his career in the Senate , Ford said " I wasn 't interested in national issues . I was interested in Kentucky issues . " Nevertheless , he influenced several important pieces of federal legislation . He sponsored an amendment to the Family Medical Leave Act exempting businesses with fewer than fifty employees . He was a key player in securing passage of the motor voter law in 1993 . He supported increases to the federal minimum wage and a 1996 welfare reform bill . A supporter of research into clean coal technology , he also worked with West Virginia senator Jay Rockefeller to secure better retirement benefits for coal miners . Never known as a major player on international issues , Ford favored continued economic sanctions against Iraq as an alternative to the Gulf War . He voted against the Panama Canal Treaty , which he perceived to be unpopular with Kentucky voters . Despite having chaired Bill Clinton 's inaugural committee in 1993 , Ford broke with the administration by voting against the North American Free Trade Agreement . 
 As he had as governor of Kentucky , Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government . While serving on the Joint Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses , he saved the government millions of dollars in printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper . In 1998 , Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998 ; Ford signed on as a co @-@ sponsor . The bill would have eliminated the Joint Committee on Printing , distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee , the House Oversight Committee , and the administrator of the Government Printing Office . It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed . Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection . The bill was reported favorably out of committee , but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton . Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in the next congress , Ford retired from the Senate , and the bill was not re @-@ introduced .

" Rat Saw God " marks the fifth writing credit for Enbom , Klemmer 's seventh writing credit , and Bray 's first and only directing credit for the series . This was one of Klemmer 's favorite episode 's of the show that he wrote , writing that " I think that scene with Clarence and Veronica getting together is just funny and cool . " Both writers wanted the main plot to involve Amelia <unk> , and Klemmer wrote the subplots . The episode also features several guest appearances ; many recurring characters from the first season reappear in the episode , including Abel Koontz ( Christian Clemenson ) , Clarence Wiedman ( Christopher B. Duncan ) , and antagonist Aaron Echolls ( Harry Hamlin ) .

 " Rat Saw God " features a cameo by television director Joss Whedon .

Whedon had previously praised the first season on his weblog Whedonesque , saying that Veronica Mars was the " Best . Show . Ever . " and that " [ he 'd ] never gotten more wrapped up in a show [ he ] wasn 't making , and maybe even more than those . " Whedon also gave a glowing review of the first season for Entertainment Weekly , writing that " Season 1 works as mystery , comedy , and romantic drama , often simultaneously . But what elevates it is that in a TV @-@ scape creepily obsessed with crime @-@ solving , VM actually asks why . " Upon being asked about Whedon 's praise , Jason Dohring , who plays Logan , said in an interview : 
 It was the buzz of the set : ' Did you hear what he said about us ? , ’ Stuff like that . [ Director ] Kevin Smith also did a nice write @-@ up , and what was cool was that they really know their stuff ; , their attention to detail [ regarding ' Veronica Mars ’ ] was so cool . You never know if your work will be seen , so to have it seen by someone great , someone you really respect , that ’ s so cool . Though if I ’ d known they were watching , I would have been a lot more nervous ! 
 Series creator Rob Thomas contacted Whedon over the previous summer , and Whedon agreed to do a cameo . The episode 's title refers to Rats Saw God , a novel by series creator Rob Thomas .

 = Characters of Smallville = 
 Smallville is an American television series developed by writer / producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar , and was initially broadcast by The WB . After its fifth season , the WB and UPN merged to form The CW , which was the second broadcaster for the show in the United States . The series features a regular cast of characters , which began with eight main characters in its first season . Since then , characters from that first season have left the series , with new main characters having been both written in and out of the series . In addition , Smallville features guest stars each week , as well as recurring guests that take part in mini story arcs that span a portion of a season . Occasionally , the recurring guest storylines will span multiple seasons . 
 The plot follows a young Clark Kent , in the fictional town of Smallville , Kansas , as he journeys toward becoming Superman . Additionally , the series chronicles Lex Luthor 's path to the dark side , and his metamorphosis from Clark 's best friend to greatest enemy . Smallville depicts the relationship between Clark and his first love interest , Lana Lang , as well as his relationship with Lois Lane , the woman he ultimately marries in the comic books . The series also features recurring appearances from other DC Universe characters , such as Arthur Curry and John Jones . 
 With five months devoted to casting for the pilot , Gough and Miller cast ultimately hired eight actors to take on the role of series regulars for the first season . Since then , only two characters from the first season have remained regulars through to the eighth season , with seven new actors taking on lead roles from seasons two through eight . Four of those new actors began as recurring guests in their first seasonal appearance , but were given top billing the following season . As the series progresses , recurring guests appear at various times to help move the overall storyline of the show or just provide a side @-@ story arc for one of the main characters , such as Brainiac or Adam Knight . Other recurring guests appear as background characters , showing up for only a few scenes , which includes characters like Sheriff Nancy Adams or Dr. Virgil Swann . 
 = = Main characters = = 
 According to co @-@ creator Miles Millar , " unlike most shows , which pick up in January and you 've got four weeks [ ... ] to do your casting " , Millar and co @-@ creator Al Gough had five months to cast their lead characters . In October 2000 , the two producers began their search for the three lead roles , and had casting directors in ten different cities . The following is a list of all the characters that are , or at one time were , a main character in the show . During its first season , Smallville had eight regular characters . Six characters from the original cast left the show , with eight new characters coming in over the course of nine seasons . 
 = = = Clark Kent = = = 
 Portrayed by Tom Welling , Clark Kent is an alien being with superhuman abilities , which he uses to help others in danger . Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent in the series pilot , when he crash lands to Earth as a three @-@ year @-@ old child . Twelve years later , he tries to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father . For most of the series , Clark spends his time running from his Kryptonian heritage , going as far as leaving Smallville , abandoning a quest his biological father Jor @-@ El sends him on in search of three Kryptonian stones of knowledge , continuing his training at the Fortress of Solitude , and unwittingly unleashing a Kryptonian criminal from the Phantom Zone when he refuses to kill Lex . 
 = = = Lex Luthor = = = 
 Michael Rosenbaum portrays Lex Luthor , the son of billionaire Lionel Luthor , who is sent to Smallville to run the local fertilizer plant . After Clark saves his life in the pilot episode , the two become quick friends . Over the course of seven seasons — beginning on the day Clark rescues him from drowning — Lex tries to uncover the secrets that Clark keeps . Lex 's curiosity eventually leads to a blowout between him and Clark in the season three finale . Lex 's investigations ultimately lead to him discovering the truth about Clark 's alien heritage in the season seven finale . 
 = = = Lana Lang = = = 
 Portrayed by Kristin Kreuk , Lana Lang is one of Clark Kent 's friends and on @-@ again @-@ off @-@ again girlfriend . In the first season , Lana and Clark 's friendship is just beginning , as she is dating Whitney Fordman during this time . After Whitney leaves for the Marines in the season one finale , Lana and Clark slowly begin to try to start a romantic relationship . In season seven , Lana leaves Smallville , leaving behind a DVD explaining to Clark that , even though she loves him , the only way for him to help the world to the best of his ability would be if she left him and Smallville for good . 
 = = = Chloe Sullivan = = = 
 Allison Mack portrays one of Clark 's best friends , Chloe Sullivan . Editor of the school newspaper , her journalistic curiosity — always wanting to " expose falsehoods " and " know the truth " — causes tension with her friends , especially when she is digging in Clark 's past . She discovers Clark 's secret in the fourth season episode " Pariah " . 
 = = = Pete Ross = = = 
 Sam Jones III plays Pete Ross , another of Clark 's best friends . He hates the <unk> for what he sees as their thievery of his family 's creamed corn business , and is the first person Clark voluntarily informs of his secret . It is established in season three 's " Truth " , that Pete is in love with Chloe . He kept this truth to himself because of the Clark – Lana – Chloe love triangle already taking place . In season three 's " Velocity " , Pete , feeling alienated by Clark , begins hanging around a group of street racers . When Pete refuses to throw a race , his life is put in jeopardy , and he forces Clark to abuse his powers in order to help Pete win a race . This leads to a falling out between the two friends . The character was written out of the series at the end of season three , citing the trouble keeping Clark 's secret was causing him . Pete returns to Smallville in season seven 's " Hero " , after gaining superhuman abilities from kryptonite @-@ enhanced chewing gum , which allow him to stretch his body to extreme lengths . Lex learns the truth and blackmails Pete into abusing his powers for Lex 's personal gain . Clark steps in and saves Pete , and the pair mend their relationship before Pete leaves Smallville again . 
 Sam Jones III was the last of the season one series regulars to be cast – being hired just four days before filming for the pilot episode began . Jones , who is African American , was also cast against the Superman mythology where Pete Ross is Caucasian . Jones has stated that he would have understood if the producers had simply created a black character for him to portray , but the fact that they chose to go with him , even though the character has always been white , gave him more honor to be a part of the show . During the first season , Jones felt like he should have more screen time , but later conceded that the show was about Clark 's journey and that the other characters are there to help his story move along . 
 Jones was not alone in his wish to get more screen time ; the writers , who were reading Internet forums and receiving mail from the audience that requested the same thing , decided that Pete would learn Clark 's secret in season two . The creative team hoped that knowing Clark 's secret would allow the character to be written into more scenes , and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family . Ultimately , Pete 's primary story arc in season three became the character 's inability to deal with knowing Clark 's secret , and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark , who was spending more time with Chloe , Lana and Lex . Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville , and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes . There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones 's departure . According to Annette O 'Toole ( Martha Kent ) , Clark needs a guy friend in his life , and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville . Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross was the best thing , he does feel that his exit could have gone better . According to Gough , Pete 's departure felt rushed , and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had . 
 = = = Jonathan Kent = = = 
 John Schneider portrays Jonathan Kent , Martha 's husband and Clark 's adopted father . He goes to great lengths to protect his son 's secret , which includes : almost killing a reporter , in the season two premiere , who was going to expose Clark 's secret to the world , and making a deal to allow Clark 's biological father , Jor @-@ El , to take Clark to fulfill his destiny if Jor @-@ El gave Jonathan the power to bring Clark home — Clark had run away after believing his parents blamed him for Martha 's miscarriage . As a result , season three 's " Hereafter " explains that Jonathan 's heart was strained while he was imbued with all of Clark 's powers . In season five , Jonathan decides to run for a seat in the Kansas Senate against Lex Luthor . In the season five episode " Reckoning " , Jonathan wins the senatorial seat , but after a physical altercation with Lionel Luthor , whom he believed was trying to exploit Clark 's abilities , Jonathan suffers a fatal heart attack . 
 Millar and Gough loved the idea of casting John Schneider as Jonathan Kent , as they felt he gave the show a recognizable face from his days as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard . Gough felt that Schneider 's experience portraying Bo Duke added belief that he could have grown up running a farm . Schneider was initially uninterested , but after reading the pilot script he saw the potential for bringing back " real parenting " to television . Schneider particularly saw his character as a means to replace the " goof " father @-@ figures that had become prevalent on television . He also saw his character as a means to keep the show grounded in reality , specifically by making sure that Jonathan 's life is clearly displayed for the audience , by performing a daily routine on the farm . 
 According to Schneider , Jonathan is " perfectly willing to go to jail , or worse , to protect his son " . The actor characterizes Jonathan as fast to lose his temper , which Schneider views as being a development of his protective nature over his family . Schneider believes that the season two episode " Suspect " — where Jonathan is arrested , but his sole concern is protecting Clark 's secret — summarizes the character well , and shows that the " least important person in Jonathan 's life is Jonathan " . Schneider admits that occasionally he and Annette O 'Toole have to " police " the creative team when it comes to the relationship between Martha , Jonathan , and Clark . According to Schneider , there are moments where they have to make sure that the characters are not taken to a place they would not normally go , specifically where the parents are useless without the " innate intelligence of [ their ] teenager " . 
 Tom Welling feels that the deal Jonathan made with Jor @-@ El at the beginning of season three made Jonathan realize that he will not always be around to protect Clark . Welling believes that it is the repercussions of that deal that allow Jonathan to give Clark more freedom in the choices that he makes during season three . Jonathan realizes that he must help Clark find the confidence in his ability to survive on his own , so that he can leave home one day . One scene that Schneider specifically remembers was at the end of season three 's " Forsaken " . Here , Jonathan admits to not trusting his own instincts anymore and allowing Clark to rely on his . This " admission of fallibility " , but faith in his son 's ability to make the right choices , is what Schneider sees as the growing of the family dynamic . 
 For season three , Jonathan also has to deal with his emerging heart problems . For Schneider , the " treatments " and " cures " that his character underwent were all for nothing , as the actor believes that Jonathan 's heart attack at the end of " Hereafter " was less of a real heart attack and more of Jor @-@ El trying to get Jonathan 's attention . A heart condition is not new to the character , as it has been used in previous incarnations , like Glenn Ford 's portrayal of Jonathan Kent in Richard Donner 's Superman , as well as the comic books . In contrast to those versions , it was Smallville that tied his heart condition to a deal that he makes with Jor @-@ El . When the moment came for his character to die , Schneider considers the event an " empowering death " , which he likens to John Wayne 's character death as Wil Andersen in The Cowboys . 
 = = = Martha Kent = = = 
 Martha Kent , Clark 's adopted mother , is portrayed by Annette O 'Toole . Martha , along with her husband Jonathan , gives Clark sage advice about how to cope with his growing abilities . In season two , Martha becomes pregnant with her first child — in the season two episode " Fever " , Clark 's spaceship heals her body and allows her to have children , something she physically could not do when she adopted Clark — but in season two 's finale she suffers a miscarriage after an automobile accident . In order to help the family financially , Martha takes a job as Lionel Luthor 's assistant in season two , but quits her job the same season in the episode " Suspect " for undisclosed reasons . She eventually takes over management duties at the local coffee shop , the Talon , in season four . She continues to manage the Talon into season five until Jonathan dies from a heart attack , which ultimately leads to her taking his state senate seat at the request of the Kansas Governor in season five 's " Tomb " . This eventually paves the way to a job in Washington , D.C. in season six 's " Prototype " , and the character 's exit from the show . Martha would return in the season nine episode " Hostage " , where it is revealed that she has been going under the code name " Red Queen " while she attempts to keep Clark off of the government agency Checkmate 's radar . She ultimately leaves Clark with a means to send the season 's threat , cloned Kryptonians , to another plane of existence . In the season nine finale , it is revealed that before Martha traveled back to Washington , D.C. that she left Clark a new costume to wear while he defends Earth . 
 The role of Martha Kent was originally given to Cynthia Ettinger , but during filming everyone , including Ettinger , realized that she was not right for the role . O 'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger was filming her scenes for the pilot . Around the time the creators were looking to recast the role of Martha Kent The Huntress was canceled , which allowed O 'Toole the chance to join the cast of Smallville . Coincidentally , the actress had previously portrayed Lana Lang in Superman III . O 'Toole thinks that the producers wanted someone older for the role of Martha , and when she came in to talk to the producers everyone appeared to be on the same page with what the character and the show should be about . O 'Toole characterizes Martha as really intelligent , but believes the character has to hide her intelligence at times " to keep the peace " . 
 Feeling like her character was wasting her college degree O 'Toole suggested to the producers that Martha go to work for Lex during the second season . The producers agreed , but altered the concept so that Martha went to work for Lionel , and that she would use this new position to spy on Lionel and find out what he knows about Clark . Disappointed when the storyline ended quickly into the second season , O 'Toole hoped that the secret her character was holding in " Ryan " was that Martha was going to run for Mayor . In O 'Toole 's opinion , Martha needs some form of outlet for intelligence . To the chagrin of O 'Toole , Martha 's next storyline — the expectation of a new child — tied the character to the farm in a way the actress did not agree with . O 'Toole wanted to perform as if the pregnancy was fake — something mentally created by Clark 's ship — but the producers insisted that she wear the pregnancy pads to indicate that she was indeed pregnant . Ultimately , that storyline ended with Martha losing the baby to a miscarriage . Before season four began , O 'Toole suggested again to the producers that Martha go to work for Lex . O 'Toole had enjoyed the moments in the show when she was working for Lionel , because it gave her character something more to do , and she wanted to do that again for season four . The producers took her suggestion and had Martha take a job at the Talon , which was owned by Lex , and which O 'Toole felt allowed Martha to interact more with the other characters in Clark 's life . 
 O 'Toole relished the opportunity that came with Jonathan 's passing , even though she was saddened to see a friend leave the show . Martha taking the senate seat was a chance to explore more adult stories with her character beginning midway through season five , which was important for the actress since Clark was becoming an adult on the show . It also allowed for O 'Toole the chance to depict " strong emotions " over Jonathan 's death . Al Gough feels that Jonathan 's passing allowed for them to explore more of Martha 's smart and strong side , as well as her relationship with Lionel . The idea was to show that there was some form of attraction between Martha and Lionel , but that Martha would never have any romantic relationship with the billionaire , especially after all that he had done to her family . O 'Toole likens Martha 's interest in Lionel with that of watching a dangerous animal : " It 's that attraction you have for a very beautiful , dangerous animal . You know you can 't stop watching it , but at the same time you feel , ' Oh my God , he 's going to kill me . ' " The actress believes that Martha 's ultimate motivation was to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark . When it came time for Martha to leave the show , writer Todd Slavkin contends that they wanted to give the character " more of a send @-@ off " than they achieved on film . Slavkin explains that they could not do anything equivalent to what they gave John Schneider , as there were already so many storylines going on by the season six finale that they could not fit anything else in . The writers also realized that they could not kill off the character , and so chose to send her to the US Senate , creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage . 
 = = = Whitney Fordman = = = 
 Eric Johnson appears as Whitney Fordman , Lana 's boyfriend , in season one . While initially friendly to Clark , he soon becomes jealous of Clark and Lana 's budding friendship , going so far as to haze Clark in the series pilot . Whitney is forced to run the family business when his father is stricken with a heart disease in the episode " Shimmer " . He ultimately loses his football scholarship , and in the episode " Kinetic " he starts ignoring Lana , and begins hanging around with past high school football stars , who recruit him for their illegal endeavors . He eventually reconciles with Clark and Lana before joining the Marines in the season one finale and leaving the show . Whitney has made a guest appearance in the season two episode " Visage " , where it is revealed he died in combat overseas , and the season four episode " Façade " , during a flashback of Clark 's freshman year . 
 Eric Johnson auditioned for the roles of Lex and Clark , before finally being cast as Whitney Fordman . When the producers called him in for a third audition , Johnson informed them that if they wanted him then they would bring him in for a screen @-@ test . After the screen @-@ test , Johnson was cast and spent only one day filming his scenes for the pilot . The producers , along with Johnson , wanted to portray Whitney as more than just the " stereotypical jock " that he could have easily become , in an effort to make sure Lana did not look stupid for going out with him . Whitney was given multiple storylines in season one in an effort to get audiences to view the character in a more pleasant light , but Kristin Kreuk feels that it was all for naught , as the audience only sees him through Clark 's eyes . 
 Johnson realized after reading the script for the pilot episode that his character was not going to be around for the entirety of the series . This became even clearer when his character 's storylines began to develop quickly . While filming " Obscura " , Johnson was informed that his character would not be returning as a series regular for season two . Initially fearing that he had made some mistake and that they were going to kill his character off , Johnson learned that Whitney would be enlisting into the Marines . The actor has expressed his pleasure in the way the writers handled Whitney 's departure , by giving the character the exit of a hero . 
 = = = Lionel Luthor = = = 
 John Glover portrays Lex 's father , Lionel Luthor . Lionel initially sends his son to Smallville to run the local fertilizer plant , as a test . When Lex succeeds in making a profit for the first time in years , Lionel closes the plant down completely and blames it on Lex 's poor managerial skills . As the series progresses , Lionel becomes interested in the Kawatche caves , which have Kryptonian symbols painted on their walls ; his interests also extend to the secrets Clark keeps . After being possessed by Jor @-@ El in the season five episode " Hidden " , Lionel begins assisting Clark in keeping his secret hidden from Lex . In season seven , Lionel is murdered by Lex , who realizes that his father has been covering up the truth about an alien visitor . 
 = = = Jason Teague = = = 
 Jensen Ackles appears in season four as Jason Teague , a love interest for Lana . The pair meet in Paris , while Lana is studying abroad . When she leaves unexpectedly in the season four episode " Gone " , Jason follows Lana back to Smallville and takes a position as the school 's assistant football coach . In season four 's " Transference " , Jason is fired from the school when his relationship with Lana comes to light . By the end of the fourth season , it is revealed that he has been working with his mother Genevieve ( Jane Seymour ) to locate the three stones of knowledge — three Kryptonian stones that when united form a single crystal that creates Clark 's Fortress of Solitude . The <unk> kidnap Lex and Lionel in an effort to discover the location of one of the stones in the episode " Forever " , with Lionel claiming that Lana has one of the stones . In the season four finale , Genevieve confronts Lana , and the two women get into a struggle with Genevieve dying by Lana 's hand . Jason , who believes that the secret of the stones lies with Clark , heads to the Kent farm where he holds Jonathan and Martha hostage . He is killed during the second meteor shower , when a meteor falls through the Kent home and lands on him . 
 The creation of Jason Teague was something handed down by the network , who wanted Lana to have a new boyfriend — one who was " different from Clark " . Gough and Millar were apprehensive because they were already introducing Lois Lane into the series , and introducing two new characters would be difficult . The pair thought about where the relationship between Clark and Lana had left off at the end of season three , and they realized that Clark had turned his back on Lana . Gough and Millar began to like the idea of bringing in a new character , one that would create a new love triangle ; eventually they tied him into the larger storyline involving the three Kryptonian stones of knowledge . 
 According to writer Brian Peterson , where Clark brings " angst " and " depth " to his relationship with Lana , Jason is designed to bring " joy " , " levity " , and " fun " . On the topic of Jason 's relationship with Lana , Ackles believes the character did love Lana , because he saw an innocence in her that had not been able to experience growing up in the upper class society ; Jason grew up having to question the actions of his mother , and with Lana he had the opportunity to experience an honest relationship . Ackles was Gough and Millar 's first choice to play Jason Teague , as the actor had been the runner up for the role of Clark Kent when they were casting for the pilot . Ackles was contracted to remain through season five , but was written out of the show in the season four finale , which , according to Ackles , was due to his commitments to the WB 's new series Supernatural . Gough contends that Supernatural did not alter any of their plans , and that Jason Teague was intended to be a single season character . 
 = = = Lois Lane = = = 
 Erica Durance first appears in season four as Chloe 's cousin , Lois Lane . Lois comes to Smallville investigating the supposed death of Chloe , staying with the Kents while she is in town . In season five 's " Fanatic " , Lois takes a job as Jonathan 's Chief of Staff when he runs for state senate ; she continues these duties when Martha takes Jonathan 's place following his death . After some reservation , Lois decides that she is interested in journalism and takes a job at a tabloid newspaper called The Inquisitor . This eventually lands her a position at the Daily Planet . 
 = = = Jimmy Olsen = = = 
 Jimmy Olsen is first mentioned in season four as the person Chloe lost her virginity to while interning at the Daily Planet . He makes his official appearance , portrayed by Aaron Ashmore , in the season six opener . Working as a photographer for the Daily Planet , Jimmy rekindles his relationship with Chloe in the season six episode " Wither " . In the episode " Hydro " , Jimmy works with Lois to uncover the true identity of Green Arrow , and in season seven , when Lois is hired by the Daily Planet , the pair work together on finding stories for the paper . In the season seven episode " Sleeper " , Jimmy falls into Lex 's debt when Lex , at Jimmy 's request , keeps Chloe from being arrested by the Department of Domestic Security for hacking into their government files . In the season seven finale , Lex goes back on his word and has Chloe arrested , just as Jimmy proposes marriage . 
 After being saved by Oliver Queen and Clark in the season eight premiere , Chloe is reunited with Jimmy and accepts his marriage proposal . In " Committed " , a deranged jeweler kidnaps Jimmy and Chloe after their engagement party and subjects them to a torturous test to see if they truly love each other — they both pass and are allowed to return to their normal lives . In the season eight episode " Identity " , Jimmy begins to suspect that Clark is the " Good Samaritan " , an individual who has been stopping crimes and saving people 's lives around Metropolis , until Oliver Queen dresses up as the " Good Samaritan " to help Clark trick Jimmy into believing he was mistaken . In the eighth season episode " Bride " , Jimmy and Chloe are officially married , but Doomsday crashes their wedding and kidnaps Chloe , leaving Jimmy in the hospital because of injuries sustained from Doomsday . In " Turbulence " , Jimmy witnesses Davis Bloome murdering someone , but when he tries to warn people Davis drugs him and makes it appear as though he is hallucinating . Eventually , Jimmy ends his marriage to Chloe after getting fed up with her always taking Davis 's side . In the season eight finale , Davis murders Jimmy after learning that Chloe is still in love with her ex @-@ husband , and was never in love with him . 
 Ashmore indicates that his casting was both a surprise and what he wanted . The actor states , " I auditioned for [ the role ] and I put myself on tape . I hadn 't heard anything , and a couple of weeks later , all of the sudden , I got the call saying , ' You 're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville . ' It 's a dream come true , really . " Aaron Ashmore 's twin , Shawn , who is better known as Bobby " Iceman " Drake in the X @-@ Men film series , appeared in two episodes of Smallville as the power <unk> Eric Summers . After three seasons with the show , two as a series regular , Ashmore was written out of the series . According to Ashmore , when the producers were first trying to get permission to use the character on Smallville , DC Comics had qualms over how close Jimmy was in age to Clark and Lois , as the character was supposed to be at least ten years younger . The producers guaranteed the department they would eventually reveal the Jimmy Olsen who appeared on the show was not the Jimmy Olsen who would one day work alongside Clark and Lois . At the character 's funeral , his full name is shown to be " Henry James Olsen " , and it is alluded that Jimmy 's younger brother , who is given a brief appearance at the funeral , is the DC Comics version of Jimmy Olsen who will one day work at the Daily Planet with Clark and Lois . Although Ashmore was sad to leave the show , he feels that the redemptive story that was given to Jimmy in the finale , through the self @-@ sacrifice he makes for Chloe , makes a good send off for his character . 
 = = = Kara = = = 
 Laura Vandervoort joined the cast in season seven as Kara , Clark 's Kryptonian cousin . She arrived on Earth at the same time as Clark , with the mission to protect her cousin , but was stuck in suspended animation for eighteen years . In the season seven premiere , Kara is released from suspended animation and saves Lex from drowning . A brief glimpse of Kara flying into the sky results in Lex 's new obsession with finding the " angel " that saved his life . Kara eventually finds Clark , in the episode " Kara " , who informs her that Krypton was destroyed when the two of them were sent to Earth , and everyone there is dead . Clark teaches Kara to control some of her abilities , and at the same time blend into society . In season seven 's " Lara " , Kara is captured by the Department of Domestic Security and tortured , where she relives one of her early memories of visiting Earth with Clark 's mother , Lara . She realizes that her perceptions of her father were wrong and that he was as evil as Clark said .

When Zor @-@ El is destroyed at the end of the battle , Kara disappears from the Fortress of Solitude . She awakens in Detroit with amnesia and none of her abilities . 
 In the episode " Fracture " , Kara is discovered and brought home by Lex , who wants to exploit her amnesia to his benefit , with the intent of discovering the truth about Clark . In season seven 's " Traveler " , Chloe convinces Jor @-@ El to return Kara 's memory and powers before Lex can learn her and Clark 's secret .

In " Apocalypse " , Kara is taken through time to Krypton , just before it explodes , so that Brainiac can kill the infant Clark . With Jor @-@ El 's help , Clark manages to arrive on Krypton and stop Brainiac . Unknown to Clark , Brainiac is not killed in their fight on Krypton , and he manages to place Kara in the Phantom Zone , while he assumes her identity back on Earth . In the season eight episode " Bloodline " , Clark is transported to the Phantom Zone , where he finds Kara . Working together they escape , and Kara leaves Earth to search for Kandor , a city rumored to hold surviving citizens of Krypton . 
 Vandervoort does not return as a series regular for the eighth season , but returns as a guest star in the season eight episode " Bloodline " , and season ten episodes " Supergirl " and " Prophecy " . 
 = = = Oliver Queen = = = 
 Justin Hartley portrays Oliver Queen , a billionaire who left Star City to live in Metropolis . While in Metropolis , Oliver masquerades at night as a costumed vigilante , named " Green Arrow " by Lois . Oliver leaves Metropolis in season six , after destroying one of Lex 's secret 33 @.@ 1 facilities , where Lex experiments on meteor @-@ infected individuals against their will , but he returns in season eight to search for Clark , after the latter goes missing when his Fortress of Solitude is destroyed . Hartley was a recurring guest in the sixth and seventh seasons , but became a series regular in season eight . 
 = = = Tess Mercer = = = 
 Cassidy Freeman portrays Tess Mercer , the acting CEO of LuthorCorp , who was picked by Lex to run the company should something ever happen to him . Tess Mercer 's primary goal in season eight is finding Lex , which draws her inquisitively to Clark , whom she believes will be able to help her find Lex . Tess 's first contact with Clark is when he pulls her from a wrecked city bus in the season eight episode " Plastique " ; she immediately suspects that Clark is not telling her all that he knows about Lex 's disappearance . That same episode reveals that Tess is bringing together a group of meteor @-@ infected individuals , and in " Plastique " she recruits Bette , a young girl with the power to create combustion on command . In the episode " Prey " , Tess enlists a young man who can turn himself into a shadow . In " Toxic " , it is revealed that Tess had a brief romantic relationship with Oliver Queen after she saved his life while he was stranded on an island . 
 In the season eight episodes " Instinct " and " Bloodline " , Tess learns about Krypton and the name " Kal @-@ El " , though she does not attribute any of the information directly to Clark . In " Bulletproof " , it is revealed that Tess knows where Lex is . Here , Lana informs Tess that Lex surgically implanted a nano @-@ transmitter into Tess 's optic nerve so that he could keep an eye on everything she is doing . Visibly upset by this , Tess places a jamming device into her necklace to disrupt the signal , but not before telling Lex that she will cut him off from the outside world and sell off everything that he owns . In the episode " Requiem " , it is revealed that Tess sold controlling interest in LuthorCorp to Queen Industries . In " Turbulence " , Tess tries to get Clark to reveal his powers after she read one of Lionel Luthor 's journals that identified Clark as " The Traveler " , but her effort failed . In the episode " Eternal " , it is shown that Tess has the Kryptonian orb that brought down the Fortress of Solitude , and in " Injustice " a disembodied voice emanates from the orb revealing that Tess 's recent actions to get Clark to reveal his powers and kill Doomsday are because the voice was instructing her to do so . In the season eight finale , the orb activates itself and transports Zod to Smallville . 
 After having her face burned in the season nine finale , Tess wakes up in the season ten premiere , with her face healed , in a secret lab surrounded by clones of Lex . In the tenth season episode " Abandoned " , it is revealed that Tess was born <unk> Lena Luthor and is the illegitimate daughter of Lionel Luthor , conceived with Lex 's nanny , Pamela Jenkins . She was brought , by Lionel , to an orphanage run by Granny Goodness when she was 5 years old . In the series finale , Tess is killed by one of Lex Luthor 's clones after she administers a neurotoxin that removes all of the clone 's memories in an effort to protect Clark 's secret identity . 
 The name " Tess Mercer " is a homage to two characters from Superman lore , Eve Teschmacher and Mercy Graves . As Freeman describes her character , Tess Mercer is Lex 's handpicked successor ; she is " fierce " , " fun " and " intelligent " . 
 = = = Davis Bloome = = = 
 Sam Witwer portrays Davis Bloome , a paramedic for Metropolis General Hospital . He first appears in the season eight episode " Plastique " , assisting Chloe with helping an injured person after a bomb explosion . In the episode " Toxic " , Chloe calls on his help when Oliver is poisoned and refuses to be taken to a hospital . In " Prey " , Clark begins to suspect that Davis is a serial killer after he finds Davis unconscious at one of the murder scenes , and learns later that Davis is usually the first paramedic to arrive on similar scenes . Davis starts to suspect the same thing himself when he begins to lose track of large portions of time , and finds himself covered in blood , but with no wounds on his own body . Davis is informed by <unk> , the wife of General Zod , that after the pair learned they could not have children that he was genetically created to adapt to any injury and to be Earth 's ultimate destroyer . In " Abyss " , Davis confesses to Chloe that he is in love with her , and believes that she is marrying the wrong man ; as a result she asks him to not see her again . On Chloe 's wedding day , in the episode " Bride " , Davis transforms into the hulking monster called Doomsday , and travels to Smallville where he injures Jimmy and kidnaps Chloe . In the episode " Infamous " , Davis discovers that he can keep Doomsday from emerging if he kills , and subsequently begins choosing criminals as his victims . He subsequently learns that Chloe 's presence will also keep the monster at bay in the episode " Turbulence " , and in " Beast " Davis and Chloe leave town together so that Davis can keep Doomsday from coming out . In the season eight finale , Chloe uses black kryptonite to separate Davis from Doomsday , leaving him human ; when Davis discovers that Chloe does not love him he stabs Jimmy with a pipe . Before Davis can attack Chloe , Jimmy pushes him into a metal rod , which results in Davis 's death before Jimmy himself dies . 
 Davis is actually Smallville 's interpretation of the comic book character Doomsday , the only character to have succeeded at killing Superman . In Smallville , Doomsday is represented as a " nice guy " paramedic , who grew up moving from foster home to foster home . His storyline is considered " very dark " in that the character uncovers horrible truths about himself as season eight progresses . Brian Peterson explained that he , and the rest of the new executive producers , were looking for a villainous character that was " as great as Lex " , with Michael Rosenbaum 's departure at the end of the seventh season , and Doomsday fit what they were looking for . Although Witwer portrays Davis Bloome , who becomes the creature known as Doomsday , he does not actually wear the prosthetic body suit that was created for when Davis transforms into his monstrous counterpart . Instead Dario <unk> , a stunt double , who stands at 6 @-@ foot @-@ 8 , performs the role of " Doomsday " when the creature appears throughout the season . 
 = = = Zod = = = 
 Callum Blue portrays Zod in season nine . Zod is first mentioned in season five 's " Arrival " , when two of his disciples arrive on Earth attempting to turn the planet into Kryptonian utopia . In the episode " Solitude " , Brainiac attempts to release him from his Phantom Zone prison , where it is revealed that Clark 's biological father Jor @-@ El placed Zod 's spirit after destroying his physical form . In the season five finale , Zod is successfully transferred into Lex Luthor 's body , after Clark unknowingly releases him from the Phantom Zone . Clark eventually pulls Zod 's spirit out of Lex 's body using a Kryptonian crystal of his father 's in the season six premiere . In the season eight finale , the Kryptonian purple orb , which was used in the season seven finale to destroy the Fortress of Solitude and remove Clark 's powers , appears at the Luthor Mansion and releases Zod in physical form . In the season nine premiere , it is revealed that when Zod was released from the orb , he was also accompanied by hundreds of other Kryptonians , many of which were scattered across the globe . In addition , none of them were given the powers that typically accompany Kryptonians under the yellow Sun . Season nine episode " Kandor " reveals that the Kandorians are in fact clones created by Jor @-@ El — at the orders of the Kryptonian Council — who also corrupted their DNA to prevent them from having powers and subsequently enslaving Earth . Eventually , Zod acquires his abilities when Clark saves Zod 's life by healing a gunshot wound with his own blood in the episode " Conspiracy " . Zod subsequently gives the rest of the Kandorians powers , using his blood to renew their lifeforce , and then wages a war on Earth in the season nine finale . Reluctant at first , Clark uses the Book of Rao to send all Kryptonians on Earth to another plane of existence where they can live in peace . 
 In an interview , executive producers Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders explained that this version of Zod is different from the one who appeared in prior seasons . The executives classified this incarnation as " Major Zod " , as opposed to his typical " General Zod " identifier , and explained that throughout season nine " the venomous side of Zod rises because he experiences a few key betrayals with our beloved characters " . 
 = = Recurring characters = = 
 The following is a list of characters that are recurring on the series ; they are listed in the order that they first appeared on the show . Seventeen characters have had storylines that have spanned multiple seasons , while the others are restricted to arcs that occurred during a single season of the show . 
 = = = Sheriff Ethan = = = 
 Sheriff Ethan is portrayed by Mitchell Kosterman in seventeen episodes spanning seasons one and two . Kosterman 's first scene as Ethan came in " Jitters " , which was originally scheduled to be the third episode of season one but was pushed back to eighth . Season one 's " Rogue " introduced the idea Sheriff Ethan had a history with Jonathan , and it was that moment that Kosterman felt like he was more than a background image for the show . That history was used against Jonathan in season two 's " Suspect " , when Ethan framed him for the attempted murder of Lionel Luthor . Ethan 's subterfuge was discovered by Clark and Pete , who set up a scheme of their own to bring Ethan 's action to light , which resulted in Ethan 's surrender and arrest . 
 Kosterman , who has played law enforcement officials before , initially turned down the role . After his agent informed him it would be a recurring role , and the producers were willing to pay him more than he made on any previous show , Kosterman decided to take the job . To executive producers Mark Verheiden and Greg Beeman , making Ethan the villain in " Suspect " was the ultimate " red herring " for audiences . Sheriff Ethan was originally going to take a nurse hostage , but the ending was rewritten to leave Ethan as more of a sympathetic character . Mitchell prefers the filmed ending , as he could not see any reason why his character would suddenly become evil . The actor believes his character fell into the established theme of " good people being pushed to do the wrong thing by bad people like Lionel Luthor " . 
 = = = Dr. Helen Bryce = = = 
 Dr. Helen Bryce , portrayed by Emmanuelle Vaugier in nine episodes between seasons two and three , is a Smallville medical doctor who first appears in an anger management class Lex is sentenced to attend in the season two episode " <unk> " . She and Lex begin a romantic relationship which eventually turns into an engagement in season two 's " Precipice " . Her relationship with Lex concerns Jonathan when Helen — after taking a sample of blood from Clark during a period when he was infected by kryptonite — discovers Clark is not human in the episode " Fever " . Helen promises Jonathan she will keep Clark 's secret , but at the same time she does not destroy the vial of blood she took from Clark . As a result , the blood is stolen from her office in season two 's " Calling " , though it did not have Clark 's name on it . Lex confesses he stole the vial of blood , which causes Helen to break up with him . Helen returns in the season two finale , where she forgives Lex and goes through with the marriage . Helen then drugs Lex on the way to their honeymoon , and leaves him to die in his LuthorCorp jet . When Lex returns in the season three episode " Phoenix " , he orchestrates his own plan for revenge resulting in Helen 's own disappearance while the two go on their second honeymoon . 
 By the time of season two 's nineteenth episode , the writers had decided Helen 's fate . Originally , the character was going to die on her wedding night , but the creative team felt they could use her more in the mythology . Gough explains the idea Helen still had Clark 's blood , she knew his secret , and her relationship with Lex was too good to write off . The creative team kept Helen 's true motivations a secret to Vaugier , which the actress enjoyed because it allowed her to play the character as if there were no ulterior motives . 
 = = = Dr. Virgil Swann = = = 
 Christopher Reeve appears twice as Virgil Swann , a scientist who was able to translate the Kryptonian language . Swann first meets Clark in the season two episode " Rosetta " , where he explains his team of scientists intercepted a message from space and were able to translate it based on a mathematical key which accompanied the transmission . Swann informs Clark his birth name is Kal @-@ El , and that he comes from a planet called Krypton , destroyed just after he was sent to Earth . When Lionel begins piecing together the alien language on the Kawatche cave walls , and Clark 's constant presence at the caves , he seeks out Swann for the answers in the season three episode " Legacy " . Swann , though he denies knowing how to read the symbols in the caves , agrees to help Lionel when he correctly guesses Lionel is dying ; how Swann helps Lionel is not made clear . In season four 's " Sacred " , it is revealed Swann died , but not before sending Clark the octagonal disk from Clark 's ship , which had been missing since season three 's " Legacy " . 
 Gough and Millar always had intentions of bringing Christopher Reeve onto the show . When the pair learned Reeve enjoyed watching Smallville , Gough and Millar decided they were going to bring him on for season two . They had already crafted a character , Dr. Virgil Swann , they knew would reveal the truth about Krypton to Clark , and they decided Reeve would be perfect for the part . According to Gough and Millar , it was " natural " for Reeve to be the one to educate Clark about his past , and help him see his future . As Gough describes it , the scene between Clark and Dr. Swann is a " passing of the torch " moment for the series . Gough and Millar explain the importance of the character : " Dr. Swann provided the first tantalizing answers to the quest plaguing Clark for all of his young life . ' Where am I from ? ' ' What happened to my parents ? ' ' Am I truly alone ? " The creative team flew to New York to film Reeve 's scenes since he used a wheelchair and required additional assistance when travelling . Although James Marshall directed the episode , for Reeve 's scenes in New York the Smallville crew sent Greg Beeman as a stand @-@ in director . Gough , Welling and Mat Beck travelled alongside Beeman to New York , where John Wells , who had previously lent his White House office on The West Wing to the Smallville crew for season one 's " Hourglass " , allowed the team to use the production offices from Third Watch for Reeve 's scenes . 
 There was initial concern over Reeve 's stamina for shooting the scenes , as his particular scene with Welling was six pages long , which translated to approximately twelve hours of work day . Beeman tried to design everything so it was as simple as possible , but Reeve quickly readjusted the scene . Beeman originally had Welling walk into frame and stand in front of Reeve , and then make a single move behind Reeve . Beeman was told , by Reeve , the scene needed more dynamic between the characters , and if Welling only made a single move , the dynamic would be lost . According to Reeve , " Tom moving around me will hide the fact that I 'm unable to move . " Beeman 's fear of <unk> Reeve 's stamina , because of the added shots to the scene , were put to rest when Reeve himself stated it did not matter how long it took to finish the scene , as long as it turned out great . Reeve was directing Yankee Irving when Smallville was gearing up to film the fourth season opener . As a result , Reeve could not reprise his role as Dr. Swann , which was the intention . 
 = = = Sheriff Nancy Adams = = = 
 Camille Mitchell appears as Sheriff Nancy Adams in twenty @-@ two episodes of Smallville , spanning the course of four seasons . Sheriff Adams makes her first appearance in the season two episode " Precipice " , when she arrests Clark for getting into a fight with another patron of the Talon coffee shop . In the season five episode " Lockdown " , Adams is killed by two rogue police officers looking for the black , alien ship which landed during the second meteor shower . Mitchell makes a guest appearance as Nancy Adams in season seven 's " Apocalypse " . In this episode , Clark is taken to an alternate reality where Adams , an agent for the Department of Domestic Security , is providing Lois with inside information on President Lex Luthor 's operations . 
 Camille Mitchell had auditioned for the role of Byron 's mother in season two 's " Nocturne " ; Greg Beeman had remembered the audition and had the actress come in to read for the role of Sheriff Adams . Mitchell did some research for the role , talking with female law enforcement officers to gain an understanding of how they evaluate situations . Mitchell views her character as a " down @-@ to @-@ earth sheriff " that carries with her a " farmer 's common sense " . The actress believes a character like Nancy Adams lends to the realism the show tries to portray within its comic book environment . Gough describes Sheriff Adams as " a cross between Holly Hunter and the sheriff in Fargo " . 
 = = = Jor @-@ El = = = 
 Terence Stamp has voiced the disembodied spirit of Jor @-@ El , Clark 's biological father , in nineteen episodes from season two through season nine . Jor @-@ El first appears to Clark as a voice emanating from the spaceship that brought Clark to Earth , informing him it is time to leave Smallville and fulfill his destiny . In season three 's " Relic " , it is revealed Jor @-@ El came to Smallville as a " rite of passage " by his own father . It is deduced by Clark that Jor @-@ El chose the Kent family to be Clark 's adoptive family after having a positive experience with Jonathan 's father . In the season three finale , Jor @-@ El tricks Clark into leaving Smallville . Jor @-@ El returns Clark three months later , reprogrammed as " Kal @-@ El " to seek out the three stones of knowledge so he can fulfill his destiny , but Clark regains his memories and stops looking for the three stones . 
 Eventually , Clark is forced to find all three stones , which results in the creation of the Fortress of Solitude in the season five premiere . There , Jor @-@ El informs Clark he needs to begin his training in order to complete his destiny , but Clark interrupts the training to go back to Smallville , which forces Jor @-@ El to strip Clark of his powers . When Clark is killed in his mortal body in season five 's " Hidden " , Jor @-@ El resurrects Clark with his powers ; as a result , Jonathan 's life is traded for Clark 's in the episode " Reckoning " . Clark 's consistent disobedience forces Jor @-@ El to imprison his son in a block of ice in the season seven episode " Blue " , but after learning a clone of Clark has returned to Smallville in " Persona " , Jor @-@ El frees his son so he can take care of the creature . When Clark thinks a world without him would be better , Jor @-@ El sends Clark to an alternate reality to show him the world would be worse if he did not exist in it . By the start of season nine , Jor @-@ El begins fully training Clark for his ultimate destiny . As part of that training , Jor @-@ El informs Clark he needs to tune his Kryptonian intuition . To do so , Jor @-@ El gives Clark the ability to read people 's thoughts , only to take it away at an important moment and force Clark to apply what he has learned about human behavior . A clone of Jor @-@ El is released on Earth in the episode " Kandor " , but he is murdered before he can fully reunite with Clark and is only able to share a single moment with his son before dying . 
 Terence Stamp 's name was deliberately kept out of the opening credits in order to keep the secret he was voicing Jor @-@ El . Stamp originally portrayed General Zod in the first two Superman films , starring Christopher Reeve . Gough and Millar wanted to provide answers for certain aspects of the Superman mythology , so at the start of season three they tied Jonathan 's heart condition to Jor @-@ El , where Jonathan makes a deal with Jor @-@ El to be given the power to bring Clark back . This power ultimately puts a strain on Jonathan 's heart . The refusal by the film department to allow Smallville to cast a body as a physical representation of Jor @-@ El forced the special effects crew to come up with a creative way to display some sort of aid to help the audience visualize this disembodied voice which was supposed to be talking to Jonathan in season three 's " Exile " . They decided to create a force field around whoever was speaking to Jor @-@ El , which acted as Jor @-@ El 's voice , rippling as he spoke . To save money on this effect , the crew filmed John Schneider on a black backdrop , and Entity FX digitally added the force field around him . Wind machines and a spot light were added to help synthesize the atmosphere in the force field . At the time of season three 's " Memoria " , where a scene depicting Jor @-@ El and Lara placing baby Kal @-@ El into his ship before the destruction of Krypton was scripted , Warner Bros. was working on a new Superman film , and it was going to be an origin story , and as a result was still banning Smallville from showing Jor @-@ El . Millar was forced to take inspiration from comic book scribe Jeph Loeb . In one of Loeb 's book , Jor @-@ El and Lara are depicted as just a pair of hands holding on to each other after they place Kal @-@ El into his spaceship . In season nine , the producers were able to provide the character with a physical appearance , and Julian Sands was cast for the role . 
 = = = Adam Knight = = = 
 Adam Knight appears in six episodes of season three ; he is portrayed by Ian Somerhalder . Adam is first seen as a fellow patient of Lana 's at the Smallville Medical Center in the episode " Asylum " ; he helps Lana get through her physical therapy after she was trampled by a horse . The two develop a friendship , which starts to grow deeper in the episode " <unk> " when Lana offers to rent Adam the apartment above the coffee shop . In " Hereafter " , Adam 's actions — specifically his injection of an unidentified drug — begin to arouse suspicion in Lana and her friends . It is revealed Adam died of a rare liver disease , and the injection of a drug given to him by LuthorCorp resurrected him , and is only thing keeping him alive . Lana discovers Adam has been keeping a journal of all her actions , as well as all of Clark 's , so she tries , and fails , to evict him . Lana asks Lex for help in getting rid of Adam , but he disappears before Lex can find him . In " Obsession " , Lex tracks Adam 's whereabouts to a LuthorCorp lab run by Dr. Tang , where Dr. Tang has been keeping Adam alive against the orders of Lionel Luthor , who cut off his supply when he failed to uncover any new information on Clark . Adam eventually breaks out of his confinement in the episode " Crisis " , killing Dr. Tang and the rest of the lab technicians . He kidnaps Lana and attempts to kill her , but Clark arrives in time to stop him . Without his serum , Adam 's body rapidly deteriorates until he finally dies . 
 When Adam Knight first appeared , there was internet speculation he was really Smallville 's version of Bruce Wayne , based on the combination of the name of one of the actors to portray Bruce Wayne / Batman , Adam West , and one of Batman 's nicknames , " Dark Knight " . The crew stated it was never their intention to reveal Adam Knight to be a young version of Bruce Wayne . The actual intention was for Adam to be Lana 's new boyfriend — a legitimate relationship — but the chemistry between Ian Somerhalder and Kristin Kreuk was not working . The creative team decided to bring the character 's storyline out of the romantic path and into a " thriller Pacific Heights direction " . According to Gough , the character 's storyline degenerated into a science fiction story , and when that occurred , they decided they had to wrap it up quickly . 
 = = = Brainiac = = = 
 James Marsters appears in eight episodes of season five , as well as four episodes of season seven , as the Kryptonian artificial intelligence known as Brainiac , referred to on the series as the " Brain <unk> Construct " . Brainiac first appears in the season five episode " Arrival " , and in the episode " Splinter " he assumes the identity of Central Kansas A & M professor Milton Fine , a fellow Kryptonian , in order to befriend Clark . His ultimate plan is revealed in the episode " Solitude " when he attempts to use Clark 's Fortress of Solitude to release General Zod from the Phantom Zone ; Clark stops Zod from being released . In the season five finale , Brainiac unleashes a computer virus that cripples the world 's cyber infrastructure . He then transplants Zod 's spirit into Lex when he tricks Clark into stabbing him with a Kryptonian dagger , providing Brainiac with a link to the Fortress so he can release Zod . 
 In season seven , Brainiac is revealed to be alive , and is slowly regaining strength by draining people of their natural metal content . Brainiac re @-@ forms into Milton Fine in the season seven episode " Persona " , and learns that his creator , Dax @-@ Ur , is on Earth . Brainiac kills Dax @-@ Ur , downloading the Kryptonian 's knowledge so that he can completely repair himself . In season seven 's " Apocalypse " , Brainiac attempts to go back to Krypton just before it is destroyed and kill the infant Kal @-@ El — he ultimately fails . In the season seven finale , Chloe discovers Brainiac has been impersonating Kara since she and Clark returned from Krypton . Brainiac attacks Chloe and puts her in a coma , but Clark destroys Brainiac before he can locate a device hidden on Earth which would allow him to control Clark . In season eight , Chloe is infected by Brainiac , who attempts to use her as a vessel while trying to take over Earth . In " Legion " , he is subsequently exorcised from Chloe 's body by the Legion of Super @-@ Heroes , and taken back to the 31st Century to be reprogrammed . The reprogrammed Brainiac returns in the season ten episode " Homecoming " to show Clark his past , present , and future and help him find confidence in becoming the hero the world needs . 
 Gough and Millar had always wanted Marsters for the role of Milton Fine / Brainiac . The pair wrote a draft for the major story arc of season five , knowing they wanted a new villain on the show to fight Clark . With the arrival of the black ship at the end of season four , Gough and Millar decided to introduce Brainiac . To them , Marsters was the only actor they could envision that could fit the " menace , intelligence , and sexiness " Brainiac was going to embody . Had Marsters declined the role , Gough and Millar would have rethought introducing Brainiac , as they could not think of any other actor who could fill those shoes . Marsters felt excited playing a character that was completely intentional ; he likened the intention to that of a shark . As Marsters explains , " [ Fine ] was just composed of his intent . And that 's exciting — it 's like watching a shark . You don 't really ask how a shark is feeling — it 's pure . " 
 Writer Steven DeKnight , who wrote for Marsters when he was portraying Spike on Buffy the Vampire Slayer , used a different approach for Marsters when writing for him as Brainiac . Spike is more " snarky " , and DeKnight felt Fine is more sincere , and a " straight @-@ ahead classic villain " . This different approach to villainy worked well for Marsters , who wanted to show people he could portray characters who were not just another " Spike " . Marsters describes Brainiac as " a murderous robot " with no remorse over his actions . According to Marsters , the character is an " intellectual " who is focused on what he wants . The actor was drawn to the series because of the " refreshing " take the producers had , as well as an appreciation for the idea of a show about Clark 's journey toward becoming Superman . 
 Though the actor enjoyed playing the part of Brainiac , Marsters did have an initial apprehension about taking the role . As he is familiar with Brainiac from the comics , Marsters did not wish to be turned green and wear the character 's traditional pink outfit . The actor had to do little research on his character , as Brainiac 's original back story only consisted of a few comic book panels . Marsters believes his character wants to get rid of the humans because they are doing nothing but destroying their own planet , and Brainiac sees it as his duty to perform " pest control " on the species . The actor was going to appear in season six , but because his scheduled filled , the producers wanted to " close the door " on this storyline , so they " killed " his character . Later , Marsters was approached by Gough and Millar about returning to the show for its seventh season ; this time Marsters had free time in his schedule , and was able to return for four episodes .

 Michael Cassidy appears in seven episodes of season seven as the Daily Planet 's newest editor , Grant Gabriel , and the love interest for Lois this season . Shortly after hiring Lois , which he did in part to inspire better stories out of Chloe , Grant begins a romantic relationship with Lois in the episode " Wrath " . The couple 's secret is discovered by Chloe and Lex in " Blue " , who both insist Lois and Grant break up to prevent questions about how Lois actually got her job . The two stay together , working harder to keep their relationship a secret . After Lex buys the Daily Planet in season seven 's " Gemini " , it is revealed Grant is actually a clone of Lex 's baby brother Julian , who died as an infant . When Grant discovers this information , he attempts to connect with Lionel in the episode " Persona " , to keep Lex from controlling his life . When Lex cannot control Grant , he has him murdered , staging it as a failed mugging .

 = Joseph Terry = 
 Sir Joseph Terry JP ( 7 January 1828 – 12 January 1898 ) was a British confectioner , industrialist and Conservative politician who served as Lord Mayor of York on three occasions . He had previously served as a deputy mayor through his role as town sheriff in 1870 , and served as Councillor for York 's Monk Ward from 1860 until this appointment . He further acted as a Justice of the Peace for both the City of York and the North Riding of Yorkshire from 1887 until his death . 
 He his widely seen as the driving force behind the success of the confectionery company Terry 's , originally co @-@ founded by his father , through the expansion of business operations through the use of the Humber Estuary to import essential commodities such as sugar and cocoa . Later in his career , he would oversee the company 's transition and specialization into a <unk> . Terry had also registered the trademark ' Joseph Terry 's and Sons ' in 1876 , which would later become incorporated under his chairmanship in 1895 as ' Joseph Terry & Sons Ltd . ' , three years before his death at the age of 70 in 1898 , during an attempt to become Member of Parliament for the City of York constituency in a by @-@ election . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Terry was born in Pocklington , to Joseph Terry , the confectioner and co @-@ founder of Terry 's of York , and his wife Harriet Atkinson , the daughter of a successful farmer from <unk> , North Yorkshire and sister @-@ in @-@ law to the elder Terry 's initial business partner , Robert Berry . His family 's wealth enabled him to attend the independent St Peter 's School , York . Such wealth had arisen after Terry 's of York had advantageously relocated to St Helen 's Square , in the centre of York , with business benefiting from the City 's intake of 30 @,@ 000 shoppers and tourists daily as a result of significant developments in rail travel . 
 The young Joseph Terry had a comfortable upbringing , with his father 's business being well established by the time of his birth due to considerable business acumen and the usage of the expanding railway network to supply his products to a growing British @-@ wide market during the 1830s . He established retail agencies in 75 settlements , mainly in the north , but also in the Midlands , Luton and London . In 1836 , he was a leading figure in establishing a trade association in London to protect the quality of lozenges and confectionery products from inferior production standards . At the time of his death in 1850 , the business had 127 staff , second only to the York glass works as the city 's largest employer . 
 = = Terry 's of York = = 
 By the time of the elder Joseph Terry 's death in 1850 , Terry 's was becoming a household name due to its previous trade successes across the country . The younger Joseph , along with his two brothers , Robert and John , are credited with moving confectionery production to an industrial scale with the leasing of a factory at Clementhorpe , beside the River Ouse , in 1862 . Its location was particularly advantageous , as the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Terry had drawn inspiration from the manipulation of the railways initiated by his father , and saw the benefit of importing and exporting from the river using steamboats . Vessels from the River Humber supplied coal for the factory , while larger ships would import ingredients such as sugar and cocoa from around the world twice a week . The Clementhorpe factory also improved the logistics of the company , providing ample room for the construction of warehouses to store stock . Two years later , there were 400 separate items in the firm 's price list , with around 13 of them consisting of chocolate as a main ingredient ; others included various candied peels , cakes , biscuits and jams among other more exotic products such as cream balls . 
 Terry 's became established as a solely chocolate manufacturer in 1886 when Joseph built a specialized section in the Clementhorpe factory specifically to manufacture cocoa products to compete against such companies as Fry 's , Cadbury 's and Rowntree 's . It would be at this factory that the now commonplace chocolate box assortment was invented , with the first named " Britannia " . 
 The company applied for its first trademark in 1876 under the name " Joseph Terry 's and Sons . " In 1895 it incorporated as Joseph Terry & Sons Ltd . , by which time it had around 500 employees . Terry also converted the historically successful St Helen 's Square premises into a ballroom and restaurant , whilst retaining its status as a confectionery shop , an arrangement that lasted until 1981 . 
 = = Political career = = 
 A committed Freemason , Joseph Terry 's successful local political career stemmed from a philanthropic and active approach to the issues of the citizens of Victorian York , often using his influential status for the benefit of the city 's populace . On 23 June 1887 , just two days after receiving his knighthood in that years Golden Jubilee Honours , Terry led a deputation to present an album of all documented issues encountered by York residents to Buckingham Palace for Queen Victoria 's inspection . In response , " The Queen turned over a few of the leaves to look at the contents , and bowed her acceptance with stately courtesy and affection " . Further philanthropic activity continued into 1893 , when Terry presided over a Japanese bazaar behind the York Art Gallery ( of which he was chair ) where according to The York Herald , he spoke : " It is right to think of our poorer neighbors . If the bazaar is successful , then 1 @,@ 000 waifs and strays would be entertained on Christmas day in the Corn Exchange . " 
 On 7 October 1850 , Joseph Terry had been granted freedom of the city due to the economic growth York was seeing fueled by his company 's success . <unk> of local guilds were to follow ; with York 's Merchant Taylor 's and Merchant Adventurer 's both seeing the benefit of representation from a well respected and moneyed benefactor . Other local organizations followed suit ; with the York Art Gallery , Horticultural Society and local waterworks company all receiving funding and financial direction by the end of his career . He further assisted in the duties of the York Cricket Club , promoting their historic move to Bootham Crescent in 1881 , whilst concurrently serving on advisory panels for both the County Lunatic Asylum and the local Sunday School Committee . 
 In 1860 , Terry was elected Councillor for York 's Monk Ward , a rural area close to the modern day <unk> of York , as a Conservative . He would later be appointed Chairman of the York Conservative Association ( something that his grandson , Noel Goddard Terry , would also later achieve ) . Experience in local government was heightened by his election as sheriff , equivalent to a deputy mayoral position , in 1870 under Liberal MP George Leeman , who served as Member of Parliament for the City of York constituency for three years prior to his appointment as Lord Mayor . In 1874 , Terry became an Alderman of the City , granting him a seat at York 's Guildhall for debate in a then partisan chamber under the Conservatives . The party , in response to his growing popularity , allowed him to run for the Lord Mayoralty within the same year , to which he was elected by consensus , defeating the incumbent local brewer , John March . This position granted him the style the ' Right Honourable ' ( a title exclusive to the Lord Mayoralty , not the individual ) . 
 Despite remaining an alderman for eleven years after his conventional one @-@ year tenure , Terry ran for the same post again in 1885 , defeating prolific businessman and philanthropist John Close , this time retaining his post for two successful tenures until 1887 's election . In the same year , he was appointed Justice of the Peace for the City of York and the North Riding of Yorkshire . Terry was elected Lord Mayor for the fourth and final time in 1891 , and remained popular among York residents , with arranged activities such as city wide galas , picnics and church services at the York Minster all funded by the Lord Mayor . York City Council ( 1980 ) writes that his name " appeared at the head of every charitable subscription list " and that he was widely recognized as " magnificently bearded " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Joseph Terry married twice in his life , producing seven children in total . His first marriage to Frances Goddard , daughter of London @-@ based physician Dr. Joseph Goddard , in 1864 produced three sons before her untimely death in 1866 . Following Goddard 's death , he remarried in 1871 to Margaret Thorpe , daughter of wealthy landowner William Thorpe of Aldborough Manor . They had a son and three daughters . Margaret also came to be known as " Lady Terry " after Joseph had been knighted in 1887 . Joseph 's eldest son from his first marriage , Thomas Terry , became the main partner of the business in 1880 , as all of his cousins ( Sir Joseph 's brothers ' children ) had chosen other professions rather than to join the family business . Thomas is perhaps best recognized for expanding trade to an international market , selling Terry 's confectionery products to as far as retailers in Australia and New Zealand . 
 Other notable children of Terry ( from the Thorpe marriage ) included Sir Francis William Terry , High Sheriff of Yorkshire from 1945 to 1946 , and Frances Harriet Terry , wife of cricketer Charles Wright , who played first @-@ class cricket for Cambridge University between 1882 and 1885 and for Nottinghamshire between 1882 and 1899 . Wright is considered to be the first cricket captain to declare an innings closed , something he did in 1890 against Kent . Joseph was also a close friend of Sir Frederick Milner , MP for the City of York constituency from 1883 to 1885 . Milner , who led an 1888 presentation celebrating the achievements of both Sir Joseph ( though he was absent due to illness ) and Lady Terry , was described by The York Herald as having " had the privilege of Sir Joseph 's friendship for many years " . 
 Though it is ceremonial for the Lord Mayor of York to reside in the Mansion House , Terry maintained a sizable private residency in the small town of Filey known as the " Hawthorn Villa on the Mount . " This building was later renamed " Langford Villa " and was recognized as Grade II listed on 23 August 1985 . 
 = = By @-@ election and death = = 
 Terry died of heart failure , induced by over @-@ exertion , at the Royal Station Hotel on 12 January 1898 , after attempting to win a by @-@ election to become Member of Parliament for the City of York . The by @-@ election was triggered by the death of incumbent Queen 's Counsel and former Solicitor General Sir Frank Lockwood on 18 December 1897 . If successful , he would have served as second member to John Butcher ( later the 1st Baron <unk> ) , whom he respected for his work within the constituency . Terry died one day before the announcement of the new member was made , and the election was eventually won by famed admiral and veteran MP Lord Charles Beresford by a mere eleven votes , in a controversial recount forced by a Parliamentary petition after he and Liberal candidate Sir Christopher Furness had both obtained 5 @,@ 643 votes according to initial data . Terry was buried at the York Cemetery on 15 January 1898 , where his monument comprised a large granite cross and a small apron of ground . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Merchant Taylor Company of York , which Terry had chaired for many years , expressed condolences but made no donation to his memorial fund . It is thought that this decision was not made on principle as , two years earlier , donations of £ 5 had been made to the " Mansion House Fund " in memoriam to prolific clergyman James Raine , who was the company 's established annual preacher and had died some years before the trust was founded in 1896 . However , the national journal Chemist and <unk> : The <unk> for Pharmacy described Terry 's passing as " a tragic feature of the recent by @-@ election " and the Yorkshire Herald fondly remarked " There was no person in the city more loved or respected , and no @-@ one who was more possessed of the qualities that constitute a genial and amiable Englishman " . His personal estate amounted to £ 38 @,@ 959 10s . 2d. upon his death . 
 Further positive affirmation came in the form of the construction of the " Terry Memorial Homes " in the <unk> area of York , on a section of the front gardens of the Dame Middleton Hospital . The charitable project was built through public subscription of a collective £ 1 @,@ 020 in 1898 in honour of the former Lord Mayor ; it consisted of two brick @-@ built almshouses , intended for married couples over the age of 60 , with the York Municipal Charity trustees having the administrative authority to accommodate or reject applicants for tenancy . On 14 March 1996 , English Heritage designated the two houses as Grade II listed under the name " Terry Memorial Homes Numbers 1 and 2 . " 
 £ 200 of the original subscription was invested in stocks , which yielded £ 6 when exchanged in 1955 . Terry 's armorial bearings are erected at the houses ( which now serve as a hotel ) and in stained glass at the All Saints ' Church , North Street as of 1978 , as Joseph 's grandson , Noel Goddard Terry , had helped fund the restoration of the building .

 = East Finchley tube station = 
 East Finchley is a London Underground station in East Finchley in the London Borough of Barnet , north London . The station is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line , between Highgate and Finchley Central stations and is in Travelcard Zone 3 . 
 The station was opened in 1867 as part of the Great Northern Railway 's line between Finsbury Park and Edgware stations . As part of London Underground 's only partially completed Northern Heights plan , the station was completely rebuilt with additional tracks in the late 1930s . Northern line trains started serving the station in 1939 and main line passenger services ended in 1941 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Original station = = = 
 East Finchley station was built by the Edgware , Highgate and London Railway ( EH & LR ) on its line from Finsbury Park station to Edgware station . Before the line was opened it was purchased in July 1867 by the larger Great Northern Railway ( GNR ) , whose main line from King 's Cross ran through Finsbury Park on its way to Potters Bar and the north . The station , originally named East End , opened along with the railway to Edgware on 22 August 1867 . The station was given its current name in 1886 . 
 After the 1921 Railways Act created the Big Four railway companies , the GNR became part of the London & North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) in 1923 . 
 = = = Northern Heights project = = = 
 In 1935 , the London Passenger Transport Board ( LPTB ) announced a proposal , which became known as the Northern Heights project , to take over the LNER lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware , High Barnet and Alexandra Palace , and link them to both the Northern line at East Finchley and to the Northern City line at Finsbury Park . The construction of the first phase of this project involved extending tube train services from the Northern line 's existing terminus at Archway station , through a new section of paired tunnels under the LNER 's Highgate station to emerge south @-@ east of East Finchley station , where track connections to the LNER line were made . 
 For the introduction of London Underground services , the original station was completely demolished and rebuilt . The station was provided with two additional platforms , giving four in total . The platforms comprise two parallel islands with tracks on both sides . This was necessary as the intention of the Northern Heights project was that trains would be able to run south from East Finchley to Highgate via both the surface and the underground routes . The inner pair of tracks served the surface route , whilst the outer pair serve the tunnel route . 
 Northern line trains first served the station on 3 July 1939 . After completion of the electrification of the line to High Barnet , Underground services were extended northwards on 14 April 1940 . The station continued to be served by LNER steam trains from Highgate until 2 March 1941 when that service was discontinued . The inner platforms are now used only by northbound trains entering service or southbound trains terminating at East Finchley on their way to or from Highgate Wood depot south of the station . 
 = = = Post @-@ war = = = 
 After the war , plans to complete the Northern Heights project were reviewed but no work was carried out . Maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds . Funds for new works were severely limited and priority was given to the completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip , Epping and Hainault . Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950 , work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project . 
 British Rail ( the successor to the LNER ) freight trains continued to serve the station 's goods yard until 1962 , when it was closed . 
 = = Description of the building = = 
 The new station was constructed in an Art Deco / Streamline Moderne design by Charles Holden with L H Bucknell . Like Holden 's other designs for London Underground in the 1930s , East Finchley station was inspired by European architecture ( particularly Dutch ) that Holden had seen on trips to the continent during that decade . The track here runs roughly north @-@ west to south @-@ east . The imposing station building , built on rising ground adjacent to the railway bridge over High Road ( A1000 ) , has three entrances . The two main entrances to the ticket hall are on the north side of the tracks facing High Road and the third , minor entrance , is on the south side . The entrances are linked by a passage under the tracks which provides access up to the platforms . 
 A strong feature of the station is the semi @-@ circular glazed stairways leading to the enclosed bridge over the tracks occupied by staff offices . Prominent from the platforms and dominating the main entrance façade is The Archer , a 10 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) statue by Eric Aumonier of a kneeling archer captured as if having just released an arrow . The archer is intended to commemorate Finchley 's ancient association with hunting in the nearby Royal Forest of Enfield . The station is a Grade II listed building .

 Super Collider is the fourteenth studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth . It was released on June 4 , 2013 , and is Megadeth 's first album to be released on Tradecraft , a Universal label created for frontman Dave Mustaine . In the U.S. , a special edition of the album was made available exclusively through Best Buy retailers . The album features a guest appearance from Disturbed and Device vocalist David Draiman . On April 23 , 2013 , the title track was released on iTunes as the album 's lead single . 
 It marked the first time the band had released more than one album with the same lineup since 1997 's Cryptic Writings , however it is the band 's final album to feature drummer Shawn Drover and guitarist Chris Broderick , due to their departures from Megadeth in November 2014 . The album debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 86 @,@ 000 copies in the United States as of December 2015 . The album received mixed reviews from critics and , as of August 2014 , has a Metacritic rating of 41 / 100 .

 On July 17 , 2012 , a tweet from the Twitter account for Megadeth 's mascot Vic Rattlehead implied that frontman Dave Mustaine had begun writing lyrics for a follow @-@ up album to 2011 's Thirteen . In an interview with NME , Mustaine confirmed that the band had been working on new material , commenting : " Some of it 's a little darker , some of it 's a little faster . " 
 Later Mustaine announced that the band was preparing to start work on the album , and suggested early 2013 as a tentative release , on a new label , as the band had split from their previous label , Roadrunner Records . The band 's previous contract with that label was only for three albums , expiring after the release of Thirteen . 
 On October 27 , Mustaine revealed that the band was planning to enter the studio to begin tracking the album in the first week of November 2012 , before leaving the studio for the American leg of the Countdown to Extinction 20th anniversary tour . However , drummer Shawn Drover later suggested that recording for the album wouldn 't begin until early 2013 , and also suggested that the album would possibly be released in the summer of that year , rather than Mustaine 's initial projection of a late @-@ spring release . Drover said the band was in the process of composing material and determining what riffs to use on the record . On December 24 , 2012 , Mustaine announced that three new songs were " tracked and almost done " . Mustaine later announced via the Vic Rattlehead Twitter page that he had chosen a title and cover art for the new album , though neither was revealed at that time . As with Thirteen , work on the album was done at " Vic 's Garage " , the band 's own studio in San Marcos , California . 
 From January 2013 onwards , several short video clips were uploaded to the band 's official YouTube channel , showing the band members working on new material in the studio . Later that month , Mustaine announced that the band had finished recording 11 of 13 songs that the band planned to give to the label . Additionally , he confirmed that the band had decided on a new label and was signed . The label was later revealed to be to Tradecraft , a Universal label created for Mustaine . Several days later , on February 1 , Mustaine announced that mixing had begun . 
 On February 12 , 2013 , the album 's title was revealed as Super Collider . About two weeks later , Mustaine announced several song titles in an interview , discussing some of those songs in the process . Mustaine also revealed that fourteen songs were being worked on in total . Recording for the album was completed in mid @-@ March . 
 On April 10 , 2013 , a snippet of a new song titled " Don 't Turn Your Back " was posted to the band 's website for streaming , and the cover artwork for the album was revealed . Later that month , it was announced that David Draiman ( of Disturbed and Device ) would be featured as a guest vocalist on " Dance in the Rain " . The title track was released as the album 's lead single , and " Kingmaker " was released for streaming in May .
