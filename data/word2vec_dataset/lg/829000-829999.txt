 Mears appeared in victory lane to celebrate his first win in the Nextel Cup Series in front of the crowd ; the win earned him US $ 377 @,@ 425 and is his only career win as of 2016 . Mears was delighted with his victory , saying in the post @-@ race press conference , " This is unbelievable . I 'm very , very excited about it and , at the same time , very relieved . I was afraid Darien [ Grubb ] was going to call me in . I 'm glad he didn 't . The only way we could win was to gamble and that 's what we did . " Mears said he had " a fourth place car at best " . It was the first time since 1991 a person with the surname Mears had won in auto racing . Yeley , who finished second , said , " This is probably the first time in two years of Cup racing I didn 't catch the bad break . I 've always run into bad luck . " , and , " At the end , we were a top @-@ five car at best " . Third @-@ place finisher Petty said , " In all honesty , it 's just a race . We didn 't change the world tonight . It feels good to come back and race with these guys . I guess third place was just the cherry on the sundae . " He also said he had a car that was capable of finishing in the top ten and that he would not have been able to run with the top drivers . Petty also praised Mears for his victory and said he felt Mears would have similar success in the future . Hamlin said he felt the top @-@ five finishers were lucky to achieve their finishing positions and that his crew chief Mike Ford said there was " no glory in winning a fuel @-@ mileage race , other than saying you didn 't run hard and were saving fuel " . 
 Kurt Busch , who led 107 laps ( more than any other driver ) was frustrated after his lap @-@ 298 crash : " How in the world we can be so strong during the day here and almost in an instant go completely in the opposite direction is beyond my comprehension . We have to get a handle on it sooner or later . I 'm frustrated and down right now , but we 'll just keep plugging along looking for the answer . " Newman , who led the first ten laps of the race , was happy despite retiring from the race : " We had a good car . We had just gotten the lucky dog and we were going to be one of the 15 cars on the lead lap . Everybody at Penske Racing has been doing a great job . We 've just got to keep it up and stay focused . " After finishing the race in fifth place ( then the best finish for a Toyota car ) Vickers said it was " rough " driving without the use of power steering that cut in and out but he felt Red Bull Racing Team had " the best car " for the race . Stewart 's crew chief Greg <unk> was disappointed his driver could not take the victory : " If we hadn 't had an opportunity to win , I 'd say that finishing sixth and leading laps would be awesome , But sitting where we are right now , it seems that everything is stacked against us . We were probably a second- or third @-@ place car at worst , so it 's disappointing . " Eighth @-@ place finisher Earnhardt said he thought he secured a second @-@ place finish and was unaware the leaders had made pit stops . He said was happy with the way his team ran the race . 
 After retiring from the race on lap 221 , Elliott blamed himself for the collision with Ragan , saying he waited too long to react and was heavily committed to driving down the racetrack . He was also unable to remove his foot from his brake pedal . Ragan said he felt he should have passed Roush Fenway Racing teammate Edwards , who spun up the racetrack . Edwards also said he was trying to avoid wrecking himself . According to Montoya , who was involved in the multi @-@ car collision on the 53rd lap : " I saw a car flying , and as soon as I saw the car flying I checked up . We actually slowed down the car and everything . The ten car or somebody came right in behind us and just pushed us through the whole mess . " Jeff Gordon said he was " fine " after the accident and that it " looked a lot worse than it really was ... Unfortunate because , man , what an awesome race car we had . I was so proud of Steve Letarte and the guys . When we bring race cars like that to the track , it just makes me have a whole lot of fun . I was having a blast out there and I hate we are out of it . But I am ok . " Allmendinger claimed responsibility for causing the crash and asked his spotter to apologize to Johnson 's spotter , who relayed the message to Johnson via radio . 
 The result meant Jeff Gordon maintained his lead in the Drivers ' Championship with 1 @,@ 921 points , ahead of teammate Johnson with 1 @,@ 789 . Kenseth remained in third with his points advantage over Hamlin reduced to thirty @-@ two . Burton remained in fifth place and Stewart remained in sixth . Harvick moved into seventh position while Edwards moved up two positions to eighth . Kurt Busch 's non @-@ finish meant he slipped to ninth and Bowyer was tenth . Kyle Busch and McMurray rounded out the top twelve . In the Manufacturers ' Championship , Chevrolet with 105 points extended its lead to forty @-@ two points over its main rival Ford . Dodge increased its points advantage over Toyota in the battle for third place .

On the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index , the streams in the watershed range from 0 to 18 . There are 51 genera of macroinvertebrates in the creek 's watershed . The habitats in the watershed primarily include mixed forest . 
 Nescopeck Creek 's watershed is 143 square miles ( 370 km2 ) in area and lies in parts of three counties . Slightly over half of the land in the watershed is deciduous forest . The rest is perennial herbaceous vegetation , mixed vegetation and annual herbaceous vegetation , and barren land . Some sub @-@ watersheds contain as much as 80 percent forest . Almost all of the streams in the watershed are within 330 feet ( 100 m ) of a road . Most of the land in the watershed has a slope of 0 to 3 percent , although there are areas with a slope of 8 percent or more . 
 There are five main soil series in the Nescopeck Creek watershed . These are the Hazleton @-@ Dekalb @-@ Buchanan series , the Wellsboro @-@ Oquaga @-@ Morris series , the Leck Kill @-@ Meckesville @-@ Calvin series , the Udorthents @-@ Urban Land @-@ Volusia series , and the Lackawanna @-@ Arnot @-@ Morris series .

 = = Course = = 
 Nescopeck Creek begins in Dennison Township , Luzerne County , Pennsylvania , at the confluence of an outlet of Olympus Pond and Creasy Creek . The creek 's source is also on the eastern edge of Mount Yeager . It flows northwest for a short distance before passing through Olympus Pond and turning west . For the next several miles the creek continues in this direction , running through Pennsylvania State Game Lands # 18 and receiving tributaries such as Reilly Creek and Little Nescopeck Creek A. Eventually , the creek passes the northwestern edge of Mount Yeager and continues into Butler Township . Here , the creek heads southwest at a more southerly angle , crossing <unk> 80 , receiving Oley Creek , and passing an area of strip mines . A few miles later , the creek turns west @-@ southwest and <unk> Pennsylvania Route 309 . Continuing onwards , it passes the communities of <unk> and St. Johns and then crosses Interstate 81 . Several miles later , the creek leaves Butler Township and enters Sugarloaf Township . It continues west in this township , receiving the tributary Little Nescopeck Creek B , crossing Pennsylvania Route 93 , and making several meanders . After a number of miles , the creek meanders into Black Creek Township , where it turns north and picks up the tributary Black Creek right before crossing Interstate 80 and flowing through a gap in Nescopeck Mountain . In the gap , the creek crosses from Black Creek Township into Nescopeck Township , where it meanders northwest , passing the borough of Nescopeck and entering the Susquehanna River on the border between Nescopeck Township and Columbia County .

 In 2005 , a study was done on the pH of the waters of Nescopeck Creek and its tributaries . At three sites , its pH averaged 5 @.@ 06 , 4 @.@ 85 , and 4 @.@ 49 . However , the pH at Nescopeck Creek 's headwaters is between 6 @.@ 5 and 7 . The lowest pH level in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is 4 @.@ 2 , which is on some parts of Black Creek . Creasy Creek is the most alkaline tributary of Nescopeck Creek , with a pH ranging from 6 @.@ 9 to 7 @.@ 2 . Other relatively alkaline streams in the creek 's watershed include Long Run ( 6 @.@ 6 ) , Reilly Creek ( 6 @.@ 4 ) , Long Hollow ( 6 @.@ 4 ) , Oley Creek ( 6 @.@ 4 ) , <unk> Run ( 6 @.@ 2 ) , and Little Nescopeck Creek A ( 5 @.@ 8 to 7 ) . Brook trout are able to tolerate pHs down to 4 @.@ 8 and the ideal pH range for freshwater fish is 6 @.@ 5 to 9 @.@ 0 . 
 At these sites , the study also found averages of 1 @.@ 7 , 2 @.@ 23 , and 5 @.@ 56 parts per million of aluminum , respectively . Concentrations of aluminium higher than 100 to 200 parts per million can cause suffocation of fish by accumulating in their gills .

 A total of 318 metric tons ( 351 short tons ) of nitrogen per year are discharged from Nescopeck Creek . Thirty @-@ three percent of this came from land , 60 percent from groundwater , and 6 percent from leaking septic tanks . Its Black Creek tributary adds toxic amounts of copper , lead , and zinc to Nescopeck Creek 's watershed . In most parts of Nescopeck Creek and its tributaries , the concentration of phosphorus is slightly lower than the concentration of nitrogen . However , at St. Johns and Conyngham , the phosphorus <unk> is considerably higher than the nitrogen level .

 Stony Creek 's water is the hardest water in the Nescopeck Creek watershed , with a concentration of over 100 milligrams per liter of dissolved minerals . Other streams in the watershed with hard water are Reilly Creek ( 28 milligrams per liter ) and Long Run ( 21 milligrams per liter ) . Some of the least hard waters in the Nescopeck Creek watershed are those of Little Nescopeck Creek A ( 3 to 8 milligrams per liter ) , <unk> Run ( 5 milligrams per liter ) , and Oley Creek ( 7 milligrams per liter ) . However , the largest source of pollution in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is acid mine drainage ( AMD ) . 
 Above Little Nescopeck Creek B , Nescopeck Creek 's iron concentration is 110 micrograms per liter and the creek 's aluminum concentration is 40 micrograms per liter . Below Little Nescopeck Creek B , however , these values increase to 1260 micrograms per liter for iron and <unk> micrograms per liter for aluminum . 
 The vulnerability of groundwater to pollution in the Nescopeck Creek watershed has been measured using the <unk> system . It is lowest in the headwaters , as well as patches near the creek 's mouth , with a value of 69 to 90 . Values of 91 to 104 occur in the northern part of the watershed , as well as in scattered patches in the western part . Values of 105 to 115 occur in the southern , southwestern , and part of the central part of the watershed . Some areas with values 116 and higher are scattered throughout the watershed except near the headwaters .

 Nescopeck Creek has coal veins near its source . These coal veins first appeared 300 million years ago . The thickness of these coal seams ranges from 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) in the Tracy Bed up to 50 to 114 feet ( 15 to 35 m ) in the Mammoth Bed . Nearly all of the Eastern Middle coal field is in the watershed of Nescopeck Creek . Sugarloaf Mountain is near Nescopeck Creek . Nescopeck Creek has a number of rapids .

 Nescopeck Creek is in the geological region known as the Ridge and Valley region . This region is characterized by fertile valleys and steep ridges . However , the eastern reaches of the Nescopeck Creek watershed are near the border of the Appalachian Plateau region . 
 Nescopeck Creek 's watershed contains several major rock formations . These are the Mauch Chunk Formation , the Llewellyn Formation , the Pocono Formation , and the Pottsville Formation . The Mauch Chunk Formation is associated with large amounts of high @-@ quality groundwater . This formation consists of a 3 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 910 m ) layer of shale , sandstone , and silt . It is situated under the Hazleton valley . The Mauch Chunk Formation contains outcrops of reddish rock . This formation is softer than many of the nearby rock formations . This formation makes up Sugarloaf Mountain and most of the Nescopeck Creek watershed . The Llewellyn Formation contains more coal than any other formation in the Nescopeck Creek watershed . This formation is 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 460 m ) thick and is composed of brownish @-@ gray sandstone , siltstone , and shale . Buck Mountain , Mammoth Mountain , and Gamma Mountain are all carved out of the Llewellyn Formation and contain coal seams . The formation was once extensive , but has been worn down by erosion over millions of years . The Pottsville Formation also contains a large number of aquifers . This formation is 250 to 300 feet ( 76 to 91 m ) thick , and is composed of gray conglomerate and sandstone . While there is no anthracite in the Pottsville Formation , it does contain three @-@ foot seams of other varieties of coal . Groundwater from this formation is acidic and high in manganese and iron . The Pottsville Formation makes up the valleys directly surrounding Nescopeck Creek . The Pocono Formation consists of conglomerate and sandstone and surrounds the Pottsville Formation . The rock formations are typically more varied in the northern and western part of the watershed than the southern part . 
 There are also several less significant rock formations in Nescopeck Creek 's watershed . These include the Spechty Kopf Formation , the Hamilton Formation , and the Catskill Formation . Little is understood about the Spechty Kopf Formation , but it occurs between the Catskill and Pocono Formations . The Catskill Formation is grayish @-@ red shale , siltstone , and sandstone . 
 A total of 246 @,@ 594 metric tons ( 271 @,@ 823 short tons ) of material have eroded into Nescopeck Creek .

 = = History = = 
 = = = Native American inhabitation = = = 
 Nescopeck Creek 's name comes from a Lenape word meaning " deep black waters " . Historically , two tribes of Native Americans known as the Fork Indians and the Delaware Indians lived near the mouth of Nescopeck Creek . Other parts of the Nescopeck Creek watershed were settled by Lenni Lenape Indians . The Lenni Lenape inhabited the Nescopeck Creek watershed a thousand years before European settlers . There is no definitive record of permanent settlements in the interior of Nescopeck Creek 's watershed , but temporary Native American settlements existed in what is now Nescopeck State Park . By the 1700s , the Lenni Lenape had left the Nescopeck Creek watershed due to encroaching Iroquois and European settlers . 
 There were two major Native American trails in the Nescopeck Creek watershed . These were the Lehigh Path , which is also known as the Warrior Trail , and the Trade Trail . Parts of these trails would become Vine Street and Broad Street in Hazleton , respectively . 
 = = = European inhabitation = = = 
 In the early 1700s , some European settlers , who were granted warrants by William Penn , explored Native American trails in the Nescopeck Creek watershed . On these paths , skirmishes occasionally occurred between settlers and Native Americans . One example is the Sugarloaf Massacre , when a group of Native Americans ambushed some soldiers on the Lehigh Path near Nescopeck Creek in 1780 . The first mill was built in the Nescopeck Creek watershed in 1788 . By 1791 , there were four settlers along Nescopeck Creek . In 1795 , Samuel Mifflin built a sawmill at the mouth of Nescopeck Creek . A gristmill was built on Nescopeck Creek the same year . A flood of Nescopeck Creek in 1786 , known as the Pumpkin Flood , was noted for sweeping large numbers of pumpkins downstream on the creek . 
 Light industries , such as lumbering and tanning , gradually developed in the Nescopeck Creek watershed . This led to the creation of numerous communities in the Nescopeck Creek watershed , such as White Haven , Freeland , and Hazleton . Additionally , anthracite coal was discovered in 1813 . Coal became an important industry for the Nescopeck Creek region by 1836 with the formation of the Hazleton Coal Company . In the 1830s and 1840s , a number of " patch towns " designed to attend mines were built in the Nescopeck Creek watershed . The population in the Nescopeck Creek watershed began to increase rapidly around this time . By the 1880s , the patch towns attended over thirty mines in the watershed . However , the coal mining industry in the watershed began to lose value around this time , coal mining was no longer a significant source of industry in the Nescopeck Creek watershed by 1936 . 
 In 1830 , a forge which made bar iron was built on Nescopeck Creek . The most destructive flood on Nescopeck Creek occurred in 1850 , when a dam on the creek was breached , killing 22 people . From 1858 to 1870 there was a tannery on Nescopeck Creek . In 1828 , plans for a canal in Nescopeck Creek were made . In 1885 , a number of French Indian artifacts , which were Plaster of Paris casts for making sculptures , were discovered along Nescopeck Creek in Dennison Township . 
 In 1891 the first part of the Jeddo Tunnel , a tunnel in the Nescopeck Creek watershed , was built . The last tunnel in this system was built in 1932 . These tunnels drain more than 32 square miles ( 83 km2 ) , of which 13 square miles ( 34 km2 ) contain coal basins . 
 A dam on Nescopeck Creek was destroyed during Hurricane Agnes in 1972 . In the early 1900s , there was a steam @-@ electric power station at the mouth of Nescopeck Creek . The Wilkes @-@ Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Nescopeck Creek in the beginning of the 1900s . The Jeddo Tunnel , which drained a colliery in the 20th century , emptied into Nescopeck Creek . After World War II , there was a large increase in unemployment rates in the Nescopeck Creek watershed due to the failing coal mining industry . From 1919 to 1926 , the United States Geological Survey had a station on Nescopeck Creek near the community of St. Johns . Two other stream gauging stations have been built on Nescopeck Creek . One of these stations , which was in use from 1949 to 1950 was in Nescopeck . The other , which was in use from 1963 to 1970 , was 0 @.@ 6 miles upstream of Nescopeck Creek 's mouth . In the 1990s , some people were caught stealing Native American artifacts at the Nescopeck Creek headwaters .

 Nescopeck Creek is home to brown trout and brook trout near its source , but does not have much life further downstream because coal mine waste in Little Nescopeck Creek pollutes the lower reaches of <unk> Creek . In 1999 , a study discovered 20 species of fish living in the Nescopeck Creek watershed . Of these , 15 had been observed before in the watershed , and five had not . <unk> Creek and its various tributaries are rated Class A to Class D for wild trout . There are a number of riparian buffers on Nescopeck Creek , of which 80 percent consist of forest . Along parts of Nescopeck Creek , there are a large number of shrub @-@ like oak trees . In the Nescopeck Creek watershed , there are prolific forests of oak , chestnut , and hemlock trees . 
 The entire Nescopeck Creek watershed has a high level of biodiversity , with the most diverse areas being Arbutus Peak , the Edgewood vernal pools , and the Nescopeck Creek valley . The creek 's southeastern corner contains the highest density of amphibian species in its watershed . The highest density of snake species in the watershed is in the same area . The lowest density of snake species in the watershed is along the central part of Nescopeck Creek . The highest density of bird species in the watershed is in the southern and central part of the watershed . The highest density of mammal species in the watershed is at Nescopeck Creek 's headwaters . 
 In the Nescopeck Creek watershed , there are seven natural areas . These are Arbutus Peak , Valmont Industrial Park , the Black Creek flats , the Humboldt barrens , the Nescopeck Creek valley , and the Edgewood vernal pools . Arbutus Peak is a 5 @,@ 000 @-@ to @-@ 6 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 2 @,@ 000 to 2 @,@ 400 ha ) area at Nescopeck Creek 's headwaters . Also , the Nescopeck Barrens are home to 15 rare species of plants and animals . The Nescopeck Creek valley also contains a number of rare species . The Edgewood vernal pools provide a breeding ground for wood frogs and Jefferson salamanders . 
 The Bird Community Index , a measure of the quality of a habitat based on the presence of songbirds , has been tested for most of the watershed of Nescopeck Creek . The Bird Community Index was high in one area near the source of Nescopeck Creek . In all other areas of the watershed , the index was low to medium . One of the lowest values is near Nescopeck Creek 's mouth . The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index ( HBI ) has been measured for a number of sites along Nescopeck Creek and its tributaries . Upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel , Little Nescopeck Creek B has a high HBI . However , just downstream of the Jeddo Tunnel , the HBI drops off by a large amount . Black Creek has an HBI of 0 to 6 @.@ 6 , and this tributary 's biodiversity is lower at its headwaters than at its confluence with Nescopeck Creek . Nescopeck Creek 's HBI is from 1 @.@ 7 to 5 @.@ 4 , depending on the site . In Nescopeck Creek , the total number of macroinvertebrate taxa at several sites ranges from 5 to 26 . In Little Nescopeck Creek , the values range from 1 to 18 . In Black Creek , the number ranges from 0 to 11 . 
 In 1999 , the only Class @-@ A fishery waters in the Nescopeck Creek watershed were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A , the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek , and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek . Only one small stream near Nescopeck Creek 's mouth had Class @-@ C fishery waters . The central part of Nescopeck Creek , as well as most of Black Creek had Class @-@ D fishery waters . There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999 . Of these , seventeen had been seen in the watershed before . However , since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that , the brown bullhead and the bluegill fish had vanished from the Nescopeck Creek watershed . 
 A large number of genera of macroinvertebrates have been discovered in and around Nescopeck Creek . These consist of one genus of segmented worm , one genus of <unk> , 11 genera of mayflies , 8 genera of stone flies , 11 genera of caddisflies , 6 genera of dragonflies , 2 genera of <unk> , 10 genera of beetles , and one genus of fly . 
 There are a total of 14 species of amphibians in the Nescopeck Creek watershed , of which 11 breed in the watershed . These species consist of 6 salamanders , 6 frogs , one newt , and one toad . There are seven species of reptiles in the watershed , of which five breed there . Five of these species are snakes and two are turtles . The biodiversity of birds in the watershed is much greater than that of amphibians or reptiles ; there are approximately one hundred different species of birds in the Nescopeck Creek watershed . A total of 29 mammals have been observed in the creek 's watershed , including three species of bats , two species of mice , and two species of foxes .

 Herschel <unk> Pinchas <unk> Krustofsky , better known as Krusty the Clown ( sometimes spelled as Krusty the Klown ) , is a cartoon character in the animated television series The Simpsons . He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta . He is the long @-@ time clown host of Bart and Lisa 's favorite TV show , a combination of kiddie variety television hijinks and cartoons including The Itchy & Scratchy Show . Krusty is often portrayed as a cynical , burnt @-@ out , addiction @-@ riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway . He has become one of the most common characters outside of the main Simpson family and has been the focus of several episodes , most of which also spotlight Bart. Krusty was created by cartoonist Matt Groening and partially inspired by Rusty Nails , a television clown from Groening 's hometown of Portland , Oregon . He was designed to look like Homer Simpson with clown makeup , with the original idea being that Bart worships a television clown who was actually his own father in disguise . His voice is based on Bob Bell , who portrayed WGN @-@ TV 's Bozo the Clown . Krusty made his television debut on January 15 , 1989 in the Tracey Ullman Show short " The Krusty the Clown Show " . 
 = = Role in The Simpsons = = 
 Krusty the Clown , born Herschel <unk> Pinchas <unk> Krustofski , was born in the Lower East Side of Springfield and is the son of Hyman Krustofski . Very little is known about his mother , aside from her name being Rachel and that she died when Krusty was around thirteen . Hyman strongly opposed Krusty 's wish to become a clown and make people laugh , believing that it would distract him from his religion , wanting the boy to go to yeshiva instead . However , Krusty performed slapstick comedy behind his father 's back . One day , he was performing at a rabbis ' convention when one joking rabbi squirted seltzer on him , washing off his clown makeup . When Rabbi Krustofski found out , he disowned his son , and did not speak to him for 25 years . Krusty was later reconciled with his father with the assistance of Bart and Lisa Simpson . It was later revealed that Krusty did not have a Bar Mitzvah service , because Hyman feared he would violate the sanctity of the rites by " acting up " . Krusty had two adult Bar Mitzvah ceremonies : a Hollywood gala which Krusty uses to stage a comeback after his show is cancelled , then a simple ceremony intended to reconnect with his father . After leaving the Lower East Side of Springfield , Krusty started his show biz career as a street mime in Tupelo , Mississippi . Krusty later discovered that he has a daughter named Sophie . He had met Sophie 's mother when she served as a soldier in the Gulf War and he was entertaining the troops . After spending the night together , he prevented her from assassinating Saddam Hussein to protect his Saddam @-@ themed comedy act . After that she started hating clowns , and kept their daughter a secret from Krusty . 
 Krusty has his own show on Channel 6 in Springfield : The Krusty the Clown Show , which is aimed towards a children 's audience and has many followers , including Bart Simpson . Krusty has licensed the show to dozens of countries , including Ireland , China , Jamaica , and Romania , that produce localized versions . Some of the early details of Krusty 's career have been revealed in clips , but he himself has been contradictory . For example , Krusty once said that he was banned from television for consecutive 10 and 22 year periods - the first after saying " pants " on the air in " Day of the Jackanapes " during a sketch about the Sputnik satellite , and the second after a disastrous appearance on Rowan & Martin 's Laugh In , where the trap door he was supposed to appear through failed to open - taking him from 1957 to 89 . Yet he was back on TV as early as 1961 - an episode of Krusty 's show exists from that year in which he interviews AFL @-@ CIO president George Meany . Krusty 's show has gone through various phases : a clip from 1963 shows Krusty interviewing Robert Frost then dumping a load of snow on the poet . The show later took a different turn , featuring Ravi Shankar as a guest and having Krusty howl a drugged @-@ out version of The Doors ' " Break on Through ( To the Other Side ) " in 1973 . By the 1980s , the show had devolved into a children 's entertainment show . During the series , the Krusty the Clown Show is shown to be aimed almost entirely at children and features many characters , including Sideshow Mel , Mr. Teeny , Tina Ballerina , and Corporal Punishment . Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty 's main sidekick , but years of constant abuse led to Bob framing Krusty for armed robbery , although Bob was eventually foiled by Bart. Bob has since been replaced by Sideshow Mel , who has remained loyal to Krusty . He seems to retire from and then get back into show business repeatedly throughout his career . His most recent retirement was almost permanent because of recently paroled Sideshow Bob 's latest scheme – wiring plastic explosives to a hypnotized Bart and sending him up on stage . When Krusty makes a tribute to Bob at the last minute , however , Bob has a change of heart and stops Bart from fulfilling his mission . Bob and Krusty were later reconciled , with Krusty exclaiming that Bob 's attempts at Krusty 's life make his ratings shoot through the roof . This reconciliation remains for the rest of the series , as Bob abandons his attempts for revenge on Krusty in favor of targeting Bart exclusively . 
 Bart Simpson is one of Krusty 's biggest fans . In the episode " Krusty Gets Busted " ( Season 1 , Episode 12 ) he declared " I 've based my life on Krusty 's teachings " and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise . He exposed Sideshow Bob 's attempted framing , helped Krusty return to the air with a comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father . For his part , Krusty is usually grateful for Bart 's assistance , but will almost immediately forget about it , presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits , and usually doesn 't even remember his name next time they encounter each other . One summer , Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty , largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty . The camp turned out to be a disaster , with Krusty nowhere to be seen , as the camp was simply a franchise location that Krusty had licensed his image to . Bart kept his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up , but one day the camp director Mr Black brought in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty . This pushed Bart over the edge . He decided that he was sick of Krusty 's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp . Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart. 
 Krusty is a multimillionaire who amassed his fortune mostly by licensing his name and image to a variety of substandard products and services , from Krusty alarm clocks to Krusty crowd control barriers . Many of these products are potentially dangerous , such as Krusty 's brand of cereal , which in one episode boasted a jagged metal Krusty @-@ O in each box . One of many lawsuits regarding these products was launched by Bart , who ate a jagged metal Krusty @-@ O and had to have his appendix removed . The " Krusty <unk> " , the company responsible for Krusty 's licensing , has also launched a series of disastrous promotions and business ventures , such as sponsoring the 1984 Summer Olympics with a rigged promotion that backfired when the Soviet Union boycotted the games , causing Krusty to lose $ 44 million . In the TV series and comic books Krusty is also the mascot and owner of the restaurant Krusty Burger . He has been shut down by the health board many times for everything from overworking employees to stapling together half @-@ eaten burgers to make new ones , as well as using beef infected with Mad Cow Disease to save money . Krusty wastes money almost as fast as he earns it : lighting his cigarettes with hundred @-@ dollar bills , eating condor @-@ egg omelettes , spending huge sums on pornographic magazines , and losing a fortune gambling on everything from horse races to operas and betting against the Harlem Globetrotters . 
 Krusty is a hard @-@ living entertainment veteran , sometimes depicted as a jaded , burned @-@ out has @-@ been , who has been down and out several times and remains addicted to gambling , cigarettes , alcohol , <unk> , Pepto @-@ Bismol , and Xanax . He instantly becomes depressed as soon as the cameras stop rolling ; Marge states in " The Sweetest Apu " , that , " off camera , he 's a desperately unhappy man " . Krusty appeared to have used cocaine , one time emerging from a restaurant bathroom with white powder under his nose , but he explained that he was simply researching a part for a film , in which he played himself . In his book Planet Simpson , author Chris Turner describes Krusty as " the wizened veteran , the total pro " who lives the celebrity life . He is miserable but he needs his celebrity status . In " Bart the Fink " , Bart inadvertently reported Krusty for tax fraud to the Internal Revenue Service and as a result Krusty lost most of his money . Bart soon discovered that Krusty had faked his death and was living as Rory B. Bellows on a boat . Krusty declared that he was finished with the life of a celebrity and was unconvinced when Bart reminded him of his fans and his entourage . Finally , Bart told Krusty that leaving show business would mean losing his celebrity status , which convinced Krusty to return . Krusty has been described as " the consummate showman who can 't bear the possibility of not being on the air and not entertaining people . " 
 In the fourteenth season , Bart convinced Krusty to run for Congress so that Krusty could introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons ' house . Krusty agreed and ran on the Republican ticket . Although his campaign started off badly , Lisa suggested that he try connecting with regular families , which Krusty did , resulting in a landslide victory . Krusty 's term started off badly , as he was completely ignored by his new , more politically savvy colleagues . With the help of the Simpsons and an influential doorman , however , Krusty succeeded in passing his bill . 
 His body features are a third nipple , a veal @-@ shaped birthmark and a scar on his chest as a result of having a pacemaker inserted into his heart after suffering from a heart attack on the air in 1986 .

 = = = Creation = = = 
 Krusty first appeared in " The Krusty the Clown Show " , one of The Simpsons shorts from The Tracey Ullman Show that first aired on January 15 , 1989 . The character was partially inspired by TV clown " Rusty Nails " whom The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and director Brad Bird watched as children while growing up in Portland , Oregon . Groening describes Rusty Nails as being a sweet clown whose show sometimes had a Christian message , but whose name scared Groening . Dan Castellaneta based his voice characterization on Chicago television 's Bob Bell who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN @-@ TV 's Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984 . 
 Many events in Krusty 's life parallel those of comedian Jerry Lewis , including his Jewish background , addiction to <unk> , and hosting of telethons . When asked , Groening has simply noted that " [ Simpsons ] characters are collaborations between the writers , animators , and actors " without specifically confirming or denying the association . 
 Krusty 's appearance and design is essentially that of Homer Simpson with clown makeup . Groening said that " The satirical conceit that I was going for at the time was that The Simpsons was about a kid who had no respect for his father , but worshiped a clown who looked exactly like his father " , a theme which became less important as the show developed . One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer 's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series . Krusty was originally just a normal man wearing clown makeup , but David Silverman noted that " at some point , we decided he looked [ like a clown ] all the time . " The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter . The writers had tried showing Krusty 's real face a few times in early episodes , but decided that it did not look right , although his real face was seen in " Krusty Gets Busted " and " Like Father , Like Clown " . Later episodes made jokes about Krusty 's face . In " Homer 's Triple Bypass " , Krusty reveals that his " grotesque appearance " is the result of multiple heart attacks . Homer remarks that he seems fine , and Krusty replies , " This ain 't makeup . " In " Bart the Fink " , he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore , leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath . On shore , he shakes off his black hair , revealing his natural green clown hair , and removes his normal @-@ looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 The third season episode " Like Father , Like Clown " is the first to establish that Krusty is Jewish . Krusty 's religion had not been part of the original concept , and the idea came from Jay Kogen . The episode is a parody of The Jazz Singer , which is about a son with a strict religious upbringing who defies his father to become an entertainer . In order to make " Like Father , Like Clown " a full parody of The Jazz Singer , the decision was made to make Krusty Jewish and have his father be a Rabbi . Krusty 's real last name , Krustofski , was pitched by Al Jean . Krusty 's father , Rabbi Hyman Krustofski was played by Jackie Mason , who won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice @-@ Over Performance for the episode . It was established in " Krusty Gets Busted " that Krusty is illiterate . This was shown in subsequent episodes like " Itchy & Scratchy & Marge " but the trait was dropped after the first few seasons because it was hard for the writers to write for an illiterate character . 
 Krusty 's design has undergone several subtle changes since the early years . For the episode " Homie the Clown " , Krusty 's design was permanently enhanced and he was given a different shaped mouth muzzle and permanent bags under his eyes in order to distinguish him from Homer . In the episode " Lisa 's Wedding " , which is set fifteen years in the future , Krusty 's design was significantly altered to make him look considerably older and was based on Groucho Marx . 
 Krusty is a favorite character of several of the original writers , many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty focused episodes . Krusty was used as a chance for show business jokes and thus many of Krusty 's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers . He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird , who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode . 
 In 1992 , Matt Groening and James L. Brooks began planning a live @-@ action spinoff from The Simpsons that revolved around Krusty and would star Dan Castellaneta . They pitched the series in 1994 . Groening and Michael <unk> wrote a pilot script where Krusty moved to Los Angeles and got his own talk show . A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers . Eventually , the contract negotiations fell apart and Groening decided to stop work on the project .

 In 2004 , Dan Castellaneta won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice @-@ Over Performance in " Today I Am a Clown " , an episode that heavily features Krusty . Several episodes featuring Krusty have been very well received . In 2007 , Vanity Fair named " Krusty Gets Kancelled " as the ninth best episode of The Simpsons . John Ortved felt , " This is Krusty 's best episode — better than the reunion with his father , or the Bar Mitzvah episode , which won an Emmy much later on . The incorporation of guest stars as themselves is <unk> , and we get to see the really dark side of Krusty 's flailing showbiz career . Hollywood , television , celebrities , and fans are all beautifully skewered here . " Matt Groening cites " Krusty Gets Busted " as his ninth favorite episode and has said that he particularly loves Castellaneta 's voice work . Groening claims that he has to leave the room every time Castellaneta records as Krusty for fear of ruining the take . Star News Online named " Krusty the Clown 's hatred of children " , Kamp Krusty , and Krusty 's line " All these rules , I feel like I 'm in a strip club " as some of the four hundred reasons why they loved The Simpsons . The Observer listed two Krusty products , " Krusty 's Non @-@ Toxic <unk> " and " Krusty 's home pregnancy kit " , as part of their list of the three hundred reasons why they loved the show . 
 In 2003 , Krusty was included in a special history of Jewish entertainers exhibit at the Jewish Museum in New York City .

Playmates Toys has made a talking evil Krusty doll , based on the one that appeared in " Treehouse of Horror III " . In 1992 , Acclaim Entertainment released the video game Krusty 's Fun House for PC and home consoles . Krusty was made into an action figure , and several different versions were included as part of the World of Springfield toy line . The first , which shows Krusty in his normal clown attire with several Krusty products , was released in 2000 as part of " wave one " . The second , released in 2002 as part of " wave nine " , is called " busted Krusty " and shows him in a prison and without his clown makeup , as he was seen in " Krusty Gets Busted " . The third was released in 2003 as part of " wave thirteen " and was called " Tuxedo Krusty " . Several Krusty themed play sets were also released , including a Krusty @-@ Lu Studios and Krusty Burger playset , both released in 2001 . 
 In The Simpsons Ride , a simulator ride opened at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in May 2008 , Krusty builds and opens a cartoon theme park called Krustyland .

 = Jane McCrea = 
 Jane McCrea ( sometimes spelled McCrae or <unk> , 1752 – July 27 , 1777 ) was a young woman who was slain by Native Americans associated with the British army of Lieutenant General John Burgoyne during the American Revolutionary War . <unk> to a Loyalist serving in Burgoyne 's army , her slaying led to expressions of outrage and an increase in Patriot military recruiting , especially in the days following her killing . 
 The propaganda that followed greatly accentuated her beauty , and the fact that she was associated with Loyalists ( although her family was primarily active in serving the Patriot cause ) undermined British claims of protection for Loyalists . Burgoyne 's inability to punish the alleged killers also undermined British assertions that they were more civilized in their conduct of the war ; the dissemination of this propaganda contributed to the success of Patriot recruiting drives in New York for several years . 
 McCrea 's fiancé was reported to be bitter about the affair , and never married . The story of her life and death entered American folklore , and was used by James Fenimore Cooper in The Last of the Mohicans and Kenneth Lewis Roberts in Rabble in Arms . 
 = = Life and slaying = = 
 Jane McCrea was born one of the younger children in the large family of Rev. James McCrea of New Jersey . Since her mother 's death and her father 's remarriage she had been living with her brother John near Saratoga , New York , where she became engaged to David Jones . When the war began two of her brothers joined the American forces while her fiancé fled with other Loyalists to Quebec . As John Burgoyne 's expedition neared the Hudson River during the summer of 1777 , Colonel John McCrea took up his duty with a regiment of the Albany County militia . Jones was serving as a lieutenant in one of the Loyalist militia units accompanying Burgoyne , and was stationed at Fort Ticonderoga after its capture . 
 McCrea left her brother 's home and was travelling to join her fiancé at Ticonderoga . She had reached the village by the old Fort Edward , but so had the war . She was staying at the home of Sara McNeil , another Loyalist and an elderly cousin to the British General Simon Fraser . On the morning of July 27 , 1777 , a group of Native Americans , an advance party from Burgoyne 's army led by a Wyandot known as Le Loup or Wyandot Panther , descended on the village of Fort Edward . They massacred a settler and his family , and then killed Lieutenant Tobias Van Vechten and four others when they walked into an ambush . What happened next is a subject of some dispute ; what is known is that Jane McCrea and Sara McNeil were taken by the natives and separated . McNeil was eventually taken to the British camp , where either she or David Jones recognized McCrea 's supposedly distinctive scalp being carried by a native . 
 The traditional version of what happened appears to be based on the account of Thomas <unk> , a British officer . Two warriors , one of whom was Wyandot Panther , were escorting McCrea to the British camp , when they quarreled over an expected reward for bringing her in . One of them then killed and scalped her , and Wyandot Panther ended up with the scalp . <unk> claimed she was taken against her will , but there were also rumors that she was being escorted at her fiancé , David Jones ' request . The second version of the story , apparently advanced by Wyandot Panther under questioning , was that McCrea was killed by a bullet fired by pursuing Americans . James Phinney Baxter , in supporting this version of events in his 1887 history of Burgoyne 's campaign , asserts that an exhumation of her body revealed only bullet wounds , and no tomahawk wounds . 
 = = Reaction to killing = = 
 When Burgoyne heard of the killing he went to the Native American camp and ordered the culprit to be delivered , threatening to have him executed . He was told by General Fraser and Luc de la Corne , the agent leading the Native Americans , that such an act would cause the defection of all the Native Americans and might cause them to take revenge as they went back north . Burgoyne relented , and no action was taken against the Native Americans . 
 News of her death traveled relatively quickly by the standards of the time . News accounts were published in Pennsylvania on August 11 and on August 22 as far away as Virginia . Often the accounts became more exaggerated as they traveled , describing indiscriminate killings of large numbers of Loyalists and Patriots alike . Burgoyne 's campaign had intended to use the Indians as a means to intimidate the colonists ; however , the American reaction to the news was not the one hoped for . The propaganda war received a boost after Burgoyne wrote a letter to the American general Horatio Gates , complaining about American treatment of prisoners taken in the August 17 Battle of Bennington . Gates ' response was widely reprinted : 
 News accounts elaborated on her beauty , describing her as " lovely in disposition , so graceful in manners and so intelligent in features , that she was a favorite of all who knew her " , and that her hair " was of extraordinary length and beauty , measuring a yard and a quarter " . One of the only contemporary accounts by someone who actually saw her was that of James Wilkinson , who described her as " a country girl of honest family in circumstances of mediocrity , without either beauty or accomplishments . " Later accounts embellished on details ; historian Richard Ketchum notes that the color of her hair has been described as everything from black to blonde to red ; he also cites an 1840s examination of an alleged lock of her hair that described it as " reddish " . 
 Her death , and those of others in similar raids , inspired some of the resistance to Burgoyne 's invasion leading to his defeat at the Battle of Saratoga . The effect expanded as reports of the incident were used as propaganda to excite rebel sympathies later in the war , especially before the 1779 Sullivan Expedition . 
 David Jones , apparently bitter over the experience , never married , and settled in Canada as a United Empire Loyalist . The story eventually became a part of American folklore . An anonymous poet wrote " The Ballad of Jane McCrea " that was set to music and became a popular folk song . In Philadelphia in 1799 Ricketts ' Circus performed " The Death of Miss McCrea " , a pantomime co @-@ written by John Durang . John Vanderlyn painted the portrait ( shown above ) in 1803 , and James Fenimore Cooper described similar events in his novel The Last of the Mohicans . There are several markers in and near Fort Edward commemorating her death . 
 = = Exhumations = = 
 McCrea 's remains have been moved three times . The first time was in 1822 , and the second was in 1852 when they were moved to the Union Cemetery in Fort Edward . The body was exhumed again in 2003 in hopes of solving the mystery of her death . Unexpectedly , two bodies — those of McCrea and Sara McNeil — were found in the grave . The 1822 move had placed McCrea 's remains atop the burial vault of McNeil ( who died in 1799 of natural causes ) . The skeletons of both were largely complete , except that McCrea 's skull was missing , possibly due to reported grave @-@ looting in the 19th century . The bodies were exhumed again in 2005 for further analysis , and were this time reburied in separate graves . 
 = Jutland horse = 
 The Jutland horse ( Danish : Den <unk> <unk> ) is a draft horse breed originating in Denmark , named after the Jutland Peninsula which forms the western part of the country . Usually chestnut , they are a compact , muscular breed known for their calm and willing temperament . The breed was originally developed for use in agriculture , but today is more often seen in urban settings and at horse shows . Some of the best known members of the breed pull beer wagons for the Carlsberg brewery around Copenhagen , as well as at competitions and for demonstrations . Images from the 9th century show a horse similar to the Jutland being used by Viking raiders in what is now Great Britain . The first written record is from the 12th century , when they were popular as war horses . Some infusion of bloodlines from other breeds occurred in the 18th century , but the modern Jutland type only began about 1850 with the addition of blood from several other breeds , mainly draft horses . A stud book was created in the late 19th century , and the Jutland population grew to a maximum of around 15 @,@ 000 by 1950 . Numbers subsequently declined , and as of 2011 it is estimated that there are only about 1 @,@ 000 horses remaining . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The Jutland is typically chestnut but may also be bay , gray , black or roan , and frequently have white markings . In the early 1900s most Jutlands were bay or black , but those colors are now in the minority ; chestnut is now considered to be the horse 's " national color " and is selectively bred . They generally stand between 15 and 16 @.@ 1 hands ( 60 and 65 inches , 152 and 165 cm ) , and weigh between 1 @,@ 430 and 1 @,@ 760 pounds ( 650 and 800 kg ) . The breed has a convex facial profile ; a short , arched neck ; low withers ; a wide chest and straight shoulder and a slightly sloped croup . Overall , it is a compact , muscular breed . Their temperament is calm yet energetic , and they are considered by breed enthusiasts to be willing workers . 
 Although compact in size , the Jutland is a strong , powerful horse that was used to transport carriages and heavy goods . An 1897 publication by the United States Bureau of Foreign Commerce noted the ability of the horse to pull carriages and stated , " For this class of work and for heavy draft generally there is probably no better animal than the Jutland horse — a heavy , powerful beast . " 
 = = History = = 
 The origins of the breed are not fully documented , but some evidence points to the ancestors of the Jutland being used by the Vikings during the early 9th century . Images from the time show Viking raiders in what is now Great Britain riding horses similar in appearance to the modern Jutland . Some of those horses may have been left behind , contributing to the base stock from which the Suffolk Punch was eventually developed . Horses from Jutland were exported to England , Germany and France during the Middle Ages , and were popular mounts for knights , especially for use in jousting . The first mention of the Jutland type is from the 12th century , when they are documented as war horses with many useful attributes . The Jutland horse appears in the Danish ballad Svend <unk> 's Kamp med Risen , in which mythic hero Svend <unk> goes on a pilgrimage to Rome and on his journey encounters a giant . Other horses prove too shy or too weak to enable him to confront the giant , therefore Svend obtains a Jutland horse from a passing miller , who claims that it is strong enough to carry fifteen <unk> . Mounted on the Jutland , Svend succeeds in killing the giant . 
 The Frederiksborg horse , another Danish breed , influenced the Jutland during the 18th century . The Frederiksborg had a significant amount of Spanish influence , and was used to give the Jutland more active gaits . Selection for the modern @-@ day Jutland appears to have begun around 1850 , when Suffolk Punch and Ardennes blood was crossbred on native bloodstock . Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire Coach Horse ( a Cleveland Bay / Thoroughbred cross ) horses were also added during the 19th century . The development of the breed was significantly influenced by a stallion named Oppenheim LXII , imported into Denmark in 1862 . Sources disagree as to whether Oppenheim was a purebred Suffolk Punch or a Suffolk / Shire cross . Six generations from Oppenheim , his descendant , <unk> <unk> ( spelled <unk> Munkedal in some sources ) , was foaled . <unk> Munkedal is considered the founding stallion of the modern breed . Most Jutlands alive today descend from two of his sons , <unk> and Prins af Jylland . The Jutland strongly resembles the Schleswig , another heavy draft breed with similar origins that was influenced by Oppenheim LXII and his descendants . With the exception of feathering on its lower legs , the Jutland also resembles the Suffolk Punch . 
 The first stud book for the breed was created in 1881 , and 22 @,@ 000 horses were registered between then and 2007 . In 1887 the first breeders ' association was formed . The first stallions were evaluated according to breed standard in 1888 , the same year the Cooperative Jutlandic Breeding Association was created . In 1898 , the " Federated Funen Horse Breeding Societies " were established in Funen , dedicated to the development of Jutland horse breeding and other heavy draught horses . By the 1950s , Jutland population numbers exceeded 15 @,@ 000 , and 405 stud farms were devoted to their breeding in Denmark , but since that time , population numbers have dwindled . Though numbers dropped , a 2008 study of the 716 Jutland horses in the Danish studbook at that time concluded that there was little risk of the Jutland becoming extinct due to inbreeding or low genetic diversity . The study , which also included populations of the Knabstrupper and <unk> breeds , theorized that the greatest loss to genetic diversity for horses in Denmark would be through the extinction of the Jutland breed , because of its genetic distance from the other two native breeds . The level of genetic diversity of the three Danish breeds was found to be similar to other European breeds . As of 2011 , one Danish breed conservation organization estimates that there are about 1 @,@ 000 Jutlands . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Although originally bred for use on farms , few members of the breed are used for agricultural purposes today , and are now mostly bred for horse shows and working in urban areas . However , the Carlsberg brewery has used the Jutland to pull its drays since 1928 . The brewery owned 210 Jutlands at their peak , and today still uses about 20 for transporting beer around Copenhagen . The Carlsberg horses also compete and put on demonstrations at many shows , promoting the brewery and the breed . 
 = German involvement in the Spanish Civil War = 
 German involvement in the Spanish Civil War commenced with the outbreak of war in July 1936 , with Adolf Hitler immediately sending in powerful air and armored units to assist General Francisco Franco and his Nationalist forces . The Soviet Union sent in smaller forces to assist the Republican government , while Britain and France and two dozen other countries set up an embargo on any munitions or soldiers into Spain . Germany also signed the embargo but simply ignored it . The war provided combat experience with the latest technology for the German military . However , the intervention also posed the risk of escalating into a world war for which Hitler was not ready . He therefore limited his aid , and instead encouraged Mussolini to send in large Italian units . Franco 's Nationalists were victorious ; he became an informal ally of Germany , while remaining neutral in the Second World War . The Spanish episode lasted three years and was a smaller @-@ scale prelude to the world war which broke out in 1939 . 
 Nazi support for General Franco was motivated by several factors , including as a distraction from Hitler 's central European strategy , and the creation of a Fascist Spain friendly to Germany to threaten France . It further provided an opportunity to train men and test equipment and tactics . 
 = = Military operations = = 
 Hitler decided to support the Nationalists in July 1936 . The German air force was used to carry the Army of Africa to Spain . A Spanish @-@ German Spanish @-@ Moroccan Transport Company ( HISMA ) and an entirely German company , the " Raw Materials and Good Purchasing Company " ( <unk> ) were established . German transports moved nearly 2 @,@ 500 troops from Spanish Morocco to Spain . Early intervention helped to ensure the Nationalists successes in the war 's initial stages . The training they provided to the Nationalists proved as valuable , if not more so , than direct actions . From 29 July to 11 October the Germans transported 13 @,@ 523 Moroccan troops and 270 @,@ 100 kilograms of war material from Morocco to Andalusia ; and it was Franco 's African forces , thus transported and supplied , which were a decisive factor in the war . Germany signed the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement on 24 August 1936 , but consistently broke it . After a Republican air attack on the German warship Deutschland , Germany and Italy said they would withdraw from the Non @-@ Intervention Committee and from maritime patrols . Early June 1937 saw the return of Germany and Italy to the committee and patrols , but they withdrew from patrols following a further attack . The German military in Spain , who were later reorganised and renamed the Condor Legion , claimed to have destroyed a total of 372 Republican planes and 60 Spanish Republican Navy ships . They lost 72 aircraft due to hostile action and another 160 to accidents . German aid to the Nationalists amounted to approximately £ 43 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( $ 215 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ) in 1939 prices . 
 German air crews supported the Nationalist advance on Madrid and the relief of the Siege of the Alcázar . The Condor Legion 's aircraft were accompanied by two armoured units . By the end of 1936 , 7 @,@ 000 Germans were in Spain . The Nationalists were supported by German units and equipment during the Battle of Madrid and during the Battle of Jarama of February 1937 . The fighting demonstrated the inadequacy of the Legion 's aircraft compared to superior Soviet @-@ made fighters . The War in the North was supported by a constantly re @-@ equipping Condor Legion . In Operation Rügen , waves of planes bombed and strafed targets in Guernica leaving 1 @,@ 685 people dead and over 900 injured . The offensive on Bilbao was supported by ground units and extensive air operations . It proved the worth of the Legion to the Nationalist cause . The Legion also took part in the Battle of Brunete and both land and air forces were involved in the Battle of Teruel . Up to 100 sorties a day were launched during the Nationalists ' counter @-@ offensive . The continued Nationalist offensive on Aragon in April – June 1937 , including the Battle of Belchite , involved bombing raids and the use of the Legion 's ground forces . On 24 – 25 July , Republican forces launched the Battle of the Ebro . Reconnaissance units of the Condor Legion warned Nationalists forces , but this went unheeded . 422 sorties by the Legion 's aircraft had considerable effect . A reinforcement of the Legion enabled an important Nationalist counter @-@ attack . 
 On the sea , the Maritime Reconnaissance Staffel of the Condor Legion acted against Republican shipping , ports , coastal communications and occasionally inland targets . The German North Sea Group around Spain , part of the Kriegsmarine , consisted of the pocket battleships Deutschland and Admiral Scheer , the light cruiser Köln , and four torpedo boats . In addition , Operation Ursula saw a group of German U @-@ boats active around Spain , but was ultimately a failure . 
 = = Motivation and volunteers = = 
 In the years following the Spanish Civil War , Hitler gave several possible motives for German involvement . Among these were the distraction it provided from German re @-@ militarisation ; the prevention of the spread of communism to Western Europe ; the creation of a state friendly to Germany to disrupt Britain and France ; and the possibilities for economic expansion . Although the offensive on Madrid was abandoned in March 1937 , a series of attacks on weaker Republican @-@ controlled areas was supported by Germany ; despite prolonging the Civil War , it would help to distract the other western powers from Hitler 's ambitions in central Europe . The offensive on Vizcaya , a mining and industrial centre , would help fuel German industry . On 27 June 1937 , Hitler ( in a speech at <unk> ) declared he supported Franco to gain control of Spanish ore . 
 Discussions over German objectives for intervention occurred in January 1937 . Germany was keen to avoid prompting a Europe @-@ wide war , which at the time they felt committing further resources to Spain would do . Contradictory views were held by German officials : Ernst von Weizsäcker suggested it was merely a matter of graceful withdrawal ; Hermann Göring stated that Germany would never recognise a " red Spain " . A joint Italian – German decision , that the last shipments would be made by the start of February , was agreed . German aid would therefore prevent a Nationalist defeat with a minimum of commitment . 
 Involvement in the Spanish Civil War had drawn Mussolini closer to Hitler , helping to get Mussolini 's agreement for Hitler 's plans for union ( Anschluss ) with Austria . The authoritarian Catholic , anti @-@ Nazi <unk> Front government of autonomous Austria had been successfully opposing the rise of Fascism , and following the assassination of Austria 's authoritarian chancellor , Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934 , had already successfully invoked Italian military assistance in case of a German invasion . Hitler 's need to prevent an Italian invasion was settled with the Rome @-@ Berlin Axis , partway into the Spanish Civil War . 
 Around 5 @,@ 000 Germans and Austrians served with the International Brigades , some of whom were political refugees . There were few volunteers for the Nationalist side ( from any country ) , by comparison . 
 = = Non @-@ Intervention Agreement = = 
 Non @-@ intervention , and with it the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement , had been proposed in a joint diplomatic initiative by the governments of France and the United Kingdom , in order to prevent the war from escalating into a major pan @-@ European conflict . On 4 August 1936 , non @-@ intervention was put to Nazi Germany by the French . The German position was that such a declaration was not needed , but discussions could be held on preventing the spread of the war to the rest of Europe , so long as the USSR was present . It was mentioned at that meeting that Germany was already supplying the Nationalists . On 9 August , the Germans informed the British that ' no war materials had been sent from Germany and none will ' , which was blatantly false . One German Junker was captured when it came down in Republican territory . Its release would be required before Germany signed the Non @-@ Intervention Pact . There was a growing belief that countries would not abide by the agreement anyway . Admiral Erich Raeder urged the German government to either back the Nationalists more completely , and bring Europe to the brink of war , or abandon them . On the 24th , Germany signed . It was at this point that the Non @-@ Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement , but the double @-@ dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent . Germany consistently broke the agreement they had signed . 
 The Non @-@ Intervention Committee was established to enforce the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement . Germany was represented by Joachim von Ribbentrop ( with Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck as deputy ) but left the running to the Italian Dino Grandi , although they found working with him difficult . It became clear the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement was not preventing German aid to the Nationalists . On 18 November , the German government recognised the Nationalists as the true government of Spain . Germany met the request to ban volunteers on 7 January . Hitler himself authored the German declaration . German uneasiness about the scale , limitations and outcomes of intervention in Spain remained . German diplomats spoke as if their men in Spain were genuine volunteers . However , Britain , France , Germany , Italy and Russia continued to believe a European war was not in their best interests . 
 = = = Control plan = = = 
 Observers were posted to Spanish ports and borders , and both Ribbentrop and Grandi were told by their governments to agree to the plan , significant shipments already having taken place . The cost of the scheme was put at £ 898 @,@ 000 , Germany would pay 16 % . The German delegation appears to have hoped the control plan was effective . 
 In May , the Committee noted an attack on the German pocket battleship Deutschland . Germany and Italy said they would withdraw from the Committee , and from the patrols , unless it could be guaranteed there would be no further attacks . Early June saw the return of Germany and Italy to the committee and patrols . It continued to be a crime in Germany to mention German operations . Following attacks ( attributed to Republicans by Germany , but denied ) on the German cruiser Leipzig on 15 and 18 June , Germany and Italy once again withdrew from patrols , but not from the Committee . Discussions about patrols remained complicated . Britain and France offered to replace Germany and Italy in patrols of their sections , but the latter powers believed these patrols would be too partial . 
 = = Early intervention = = 
 Following the military coup in Spain at the start of the Spanish Civil War , the Spanish Second Republic turned to the Soviet Union and France for support , and the Nationalists requested the support of Hitler 's Germany and fascist Italy . The first attempt to secure German aviation was made on 22 July , with a request for 10 transport aircraft . Franco contacted Hitler directly . German ministers were split on whether to support the Nationalists , and possibly become embroiled in a European war as a result . Ultimately Hitler decided to support the Nationalists on 25 or 26 July , but was still wary of provoking a Europe @-@ wide war . The Reich Air Travel Ministry concluded that Nationalist forces would need at least 20 Ju 52s , flown by Deutsche Lufthansa pilots , to carry the Army of Africa from Spanish Morocco to Spain . This mission became known as Operation Magic Fire ( German : Feuerzauber ) . The joint Spanish @-@ German Sociedad Hispano @-@ <unk> de Transportes ( HISMA ) " Spanish @-@ Moroccan Transport Company " and an entirely German company , the Raw Materials and Good Purchasing Company ( German : <unk> @-@ und @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> ) were established . This involvement was kept covert , hidden from both foreign and economic ministries , and funded with three million Reichmarks . 
 The organisation and recruitment of German volunteers was also kept secret ; by 27 July the call for pilots had been made in major German cities . The first contingent of 86 men left on 1 August in civilian clothes , unaware of where they were going . They were accompanied with six biplane fighters , anti @-@ aircraft guns and about 100 tons of other supplies . They were placed at <unk> airfield near Seville , and accompanied by German air transport , they began the airlift of Franco 's troops to Spain . Germany 's involvement grew in September to encompass the Wehrmacht 's other branches ; Operation Magic Fire was renamed Operation Guido in November . A wide belief was that the soldiers would train Spanish Nationalists , and not engage the Republicans . In August , 155 tons of bombs were transferred from Germany through Portugal . Other military aid was provided . The head of the Kriegsmarine initially refused to provide submarines , but this changed after 24 October , upon the signing of the Rome @-@ Berlin Axis , when it became clear to Mussolini 's Italy would do the same . The Kriegsmarine also provided various surface ships and coordinated the movement of German supplies to Spain . German U @-@ Boats were dispatched to Spanish waters under the codename Ursula . 
 In the two weeks following 27 July , German transports moved nearly 2 @,@ 500 troops of the Army of Africa to Spain ; 1 @,@ 500 between 29 July and 5 August . Transport planes were moved to Spain from Germany via San Remo in Italy . German aircraft continued to provide cover for ship movements in the Strait of Gibraltar . There were fuel shortages , however , these eased as more fuel arrived from Germany . By 11 October , the mission 's official end , 13 @,@ 500 troops , 127 machine guns and 36 field guns had been carried into Spain from Morocco . Over this period there was a movement from training and supply missions of overt combat . The operation leader , Alexander von Scheele , was replaced by Walter Warlimont , and was moved into Franco 's headquarters to coordinate military and diplomatic efforts . In September , 86 tons of bombs , 40 Panzer PzKpfw I tanks and 122 personnel had been landed in Spain ; they were accompanied with 108 aircraft in the July – October period , split between aircraft for the Nationalist faction itself and planes for German volunteers in Spain . 
 German air crews supported the Nationalist advance on Madrid , and the successful relief of the Siege of the Alcázar . Ultimately , this phase of the Siege of Madrid was unsuccessful . Soviet air support for the Republicans was growing , particularly through the supply of Polikarpov aircraft . Warlimont appealed to Nazi Germany to step up support . Some Nazi figures , including Göring , were opposed , but following German recognition of Franco 's government on 30 September , German efforts in Spain were reorganised and expanded . The existing command structure was replaced with the <unk> Rügen , and the military units already in Spain were formed into a new legion , which was briefly called the Iron Rations ( German : Eiserne <unk> ) and the Iron Legion ( German : Eiserne Legion ) before Göring renamed it the Condor Legion ( German : Legion Condor ) . The first German chargé to Franco 's government , General Wilhelm von Faupel , arrived in November , but was told not to interfere in military matters . By mid @-@ November , 20 German shipments had arrived in Spain , carrying supplies like ammunition , aviation fuel , rifles , grenades , radio equipment and both civilian and military vehicles . 
 Göring ( who controlled Rheinmetall @-@ Borsig ) supplied arms to the Republicans ; shipped to Greece supposedly for their use , the arms were transferred by <unk> to ships supposedly sailing to Mexico . He was also supplying the Nationalists , who got the best and latest weapons while the Republicans got the oldest and least serviceable . This supply peaked in 1937 – 38 . Nationalists identified 18 vessels to Republican ports from 3 January 1937 and 11 May 1938 , and estimated that Goering received the equivalent of one pound sterling per rifle . An earlier shipment from Hamburg to Alicante on 1 October 1936 by the Welsh ship <unk> had 19 @,@ 000 rifles , 101 machine guns and more than 20 million cartridges for the CNT militia in Barcelona . Nazi Germany also helped the propaganda war with a gift of a Telefunken transmitter for the newly created national radio service . 
 = = The Condor Legion = = 
 The Condor Legion , upon establishment , consisted of the Kampfgruppe 88 , with three squadrons of Ju 52 bombers and the Jagdgruppe 88 with three squadrons of Heinkel He 51 fighters , the reconnaissance Aufklärungsgruppe 88 ( supplemented by the Aufklärungsgruppe See 88 ) , an anti @-@ aircraft group , the <unk> 88 , and a signals group , the <unk> 88 . Overall command was given to Hugo Sperrle , with Alexander Holle as chief of staff . Scheele was transferred to become a military attaché in Salamanca . Two armoured units under the command of Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma , with 106 Panzer Is , were also operational . 
 The Nationalists were supported by German and Italian units and equipment during the Battle of Madrid . However , the military situation in Madrid remained poor for the Nationalists , and both German and Italian aircraft ( under Franco 's direction ) began bombing raids on the city as a whole . The Germans were keen to observe the effects of civilian bombings and the deliberate burning of the city . Offensives involving German aircraft , as well as the bombings , were unsuccessful . Increasing Republican air superiority became apparent , particularly the strength of the Soviet Polikarpov I @-@ 15 and I @-@ 16 aircraft . Historian Hugh Thomas described their armaments as " primitive " . Faupel , in November – December , urged the creation of a single German unit of 15 @,@ 000 – 30 @,@ 000 , believing it would be enough to turn the tide of the war to the Nationalists . Hans @-@ Heinrich <unk> argued this would be insufficient , and that larger measures could provoke the wrath of the Spanish . Between late 1936 and early 1937 , new aircraft were sent to the Condor Legion . Older aircraft were passed onto the Nationalists . By the end of 1936 , 7 @,@ 000 Germans were in Spain . The British estimated that between January 1937 and August 1938 , 320 @,@ 000 rifles and 550 @,@ 000 revolvers were transferred to the Nationalists from Germany . 
 German forces also operated in the Battle of Jarama , which began with a Nationalist offensive on 6 February 1937 . It included German @-@ supplied ground forces , including two batteries of machine guns , a tank division , and the Condor Legion 's anti @-@ aircraft guns . Bombing by both Republican and Nationalist aircraft helped ensure a stalemate . It showed up the inadequacy of the Legion 's aircraft , faced with superior Soviet @-@ made fighters . The Legion 's efforts only partly mitigated what was a significant defeat for the Nationalists at the Battle of Guadalajara during March . A joint Italian @-@ German general had been set up in January 1937 to advise Franco on war planning . The defeat of a significant Italian force and the growing Soviet superiority in tanks and aircraft led the Germans to support a plan to abandon the offensive on Madrid and instead concentrate a series of attacks on weaker Republican @-@ controlled areas . While many countries believed motorised troops to have been proven less effective than first thought , it was the inadequacy of the Italians as a fighting force that dominated German thought . 
 = = = The Vizcaya Campaign = = = 
 The isolated area of Vizcaya , a predominantly Basque part of northern Spain , was the most immediate target , in what was called the War in the North . It was largely a Nationalist and Italian offensive , but was supported by a consistently re @-@ equipping Condor Legion . Sperrle remained in Salamanca ; Wolfram von Richthofen replaced Holle in January as deputy and in actual command . The Legion 's air force initially attacked the towns of <unk> and Durango . Durango had no anti @-@ aircraft defence , and only minor other defences . According to the Basques , 250 civilians died on 31 March , including the priest , nuns and congregation of a church ceremony . The Germans , with their air raids , were hated . The Basque ground forces were in full retreat towards Bilbao , through the town of Guernica , which was attacked on 26 April in one of the most controversial events of the Spanish Civil War . In Operation Rügen , waves of planes bombed and strafed targets in the town . The number of casualties is a matter of controversy , with between 200 and 300 people killed ; the number reported dead by the Basques was 1 @,@ 654 dead and 889 wounded . Several explanations were put forward by the Nationalists , including blaming the attack on the Republicans , that the attack on the town had been a prolonged offensive . However , the nature of the operation itself makes this seem unlikely . The offensive on Bilbao , when it eventually came on 11 July , was supported by ground units of the Condor Legion , and extensive air operations . It proved the worth of the Condor Legion to the Nationalist cause . 
 = = = Further campaigns = = = 
 The Condor Legion also took part in the Battle of Brunete . The Legion was sent from the north to reinforce the broken line . There were repeated raids on Spanish Republican Army armoured vehicles and later defensive positions by both bombers and fighters based at Salamanca . Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft were ineffective , despite Nationalist fears , compared with German aircraft . The Legion lost eight aircraft , but claimed 18 victories . German tactics were also improved with the experience of Brunete , particularly the en masse use of tanks by the Nationalists . 
 The Nationalists returned to focus on the capture of northern Spain . German test aircraft , with the latest models , faced an outdated Basque section ( Escuadrilla <unk> ) of the Spanish Republican Air Force . Heavy aerial bombardment from 200 Nationalist , German and Italian aircraft was used far behind Basque lines in August 1937 , leading to the fall of Santander after the Battle of Santander on 1 September . The formal battle in Asturias ended with the fall of Gijón on 21 October . Germany immediately began to ship the products of the region 's industry back to Germany . Sperrle argued repeatedly with Faupel , and against HISMA 's monopoly . Faupel was replaced with Eberhard von <unk> by Franco , through Sperrle . Sperrle also returned to Germany and was replaced by Helmuth Volkmann ; following disagreements with Volkmann , Von Richthofen would be replaced with Hermann <unk> in early 1938 . 
 The Condor Legion began a week of strikes against Republican airfields , halted by the Republican advance on Teruel and the ensuing Battle of Teruel . Both the Legion 's land and air forces were used . Poor weather resulted in few flights , and the town fell to Republican forces on 6 January . Up to 100 sorties a day were launched during the Nationalist 's counter @-@ offensive through the <unk> valley . Teruel was retaken on 22 February . The continued Nationalist offensive on Aragon in April – June 1937 , including the Battle of Belchite , involved bombing raids and the use of the Legion 's ground forces . The Legion was switched to focus in the north , towards the Segre river , before moving south again following Nationalist successes . Hitler 's words to his colleagues belied a change in attitude about the war in Germany – that a quick victory in the war was not desirable , a mere continuation of the war would be preferable . German policy would be to prevent a Republican defeat . However , casualties were beginning to mount for the Legion and , combined with a resurgence in Republican air activity , the Nationalist advance stalled . Arguments over the bill to the Germans – now rising at 10 million Reichmarks a month – continued , unresolved . The Legion 's materiel had been exhausted . 
 On 24 – 25 July , Republican forces launched the last major offensive of the war , the Battle of the Ebro . Reconnaissance units of the Condor Legion had noticed a troop build @-@ up , and warned Nationalists forces . The warning went unheeded . Although the Republic gained ground , Republican forces failed to gain control of <unk> , with 422 sorties by the Legion having considerable effect . However , tensions in Czechoslovakia and a shortage of pilots in Germany led to the return of 250 pilots from the Legion . Although trained Spaniards made up some of the shortfall , Volkmann complained to central command in Berlin , which led to his recall in September . During the battle , which saw 113 days of fighting , only 10 aircraft were lost ( some by accident ) ; the Legion claimed around 100 Republican aircraft . Only five aircrew had been killed , and six captured . Aid from Germany temporarily halted in mid @-@ September . Germany and Nationalist Spain settled the issue of German interests in Spanish mines . 
 The Legion took a short break from active duty to receive new aircraft , including Bf 109Es , He <unk> and <unk> , and Hs <unk> , bringing its strength to 96 aircraft , around a fifth of the Nationalist 's force as a whole . Von Richthofen returned to Spain in overall command , with Hans Seidemann as chief of staff . This reinforcement may have been the single most important intervention by a foreign side in the war , enabling a counterattack after the Battle of the Ebro . It mainly took part in operations against the remaining Republican air force during January – February 1939 , with considerable success . It was rapidly dissolved . The men returned on 26 May ; the best aircraft were returned to Germany and the rest of the equipment bought by the new Spanish regime . 
 The Condor Legion claimed to have destroyed 320 Republican aircraft through aerial combat and shot down another 52 using anti @-@ aircraft guns . They also claimed to have destroyed 60 ships . They lost 72 aircraft due to hostile action , and another 160 to accidents . 
 = = Maritime operations = = 
 = = = Condor Legion = = = 
 The Maritime Reconnaissance Staffel 88 ( German : <unk> See 88 ) was the Condor Legion 's maritime unit under the command of Karl Heinz Wolff . Operating independently of the land @-@ based division , it acted against Republican shipping , ports , coastal communications and occasionally inland targets such as bridges . It used floatplanes , starting with the Heinkel He 60 , which began operating in October 1936 . Beginning in June , operations were expanded to allow attacks on all Republican ports , so long as no British ships were present . Ten ships were attacked in the second half of 1937 ; however , the Norwegian torpedoes being used proved ineffective , and strafing or bombing targets was used instead . 
 The arrival of Martin <unk> saw operations expand , targeting Alicante , Almeria , Barcelona and <unk> . As naval activity declined , inland targets became more numerous , and night missions began . Activities in support of ground forces became the main focus of the unit until the end of hostilities . In total , eleven men were killed in action , and five others died due to accident or illness . 
 = = = Kriegsmarine = = = 
 Overtly , the Kriegsmarine was part of the force enforcing the non @-@ intervention agreement signed on 28 September 1936 , which barred its signatory countries from interfering in the Civil War . However , this agreement was clearly broken by France , the USSR , Germany and Italy , who supported one faction or another . As a result , the German pocket battleships Deutschland and Admiral Scheer stood guard in the Strait of Gibraltar to prevent interference from Republican ships while Franco transported his troops to the Spanish mainland . By mid @-@ October , the German North Sea Group around Spain consisted of the pocket battleships Deutschland and Admiral Scheer , the light cruiser Köln , and four torpedo boats . They quickly uncovered evidence that the Soviet Union was supplying the Republicans . They also helped the aircraft bound for the Condor Legion to cross the Mediterranean and assisted in the Battle of Málaga . 
 On 29 May , Deutschland was attacked by two Republican planes . It was claimed that their Soviet pilots had mistaken it for the Nationalist ship Canarias , or else had been fired upon by it . 32 sailors were killed , the Kriegsmarine 's greatest loss of life in the war . After a retaliatory attack on Almeria ( Valencia had been the original target , but minefields posed too great a problem ) , Germany came close to withdrawing from the agreement , but British diplomatic efforts to keep Germany patrolling prevailed . After the Germans claimed that Leipzig had been attacked by an unidentified submarine off Oran , it formally withdrew from international patrols to enforce the agreement . Republican minister of defense Indalecio Prieto considered a declaration of war on Germany , but Soviet fear of a world war prevented this . 
 = = = Operation Ursula = = = 
 Operation Ursula ( named after the daughter of Karl Dönitz ) saw a group of German U @-@ boats active around the waters near Spain against the Spanish Republican Navy , under the overall command of Hermann Boehm ( Konteradmiral since 1934 , and Vizeadmiral since April 1 , 1937 ) in Berlin . It began on 20 November 1936 , with the movement of U @-@ 33 and U @-@ 34 from Wilhelmshaven . Any identification marks were obscured , and the whole mission was kept secret . They entered the Mediterranean on the night of 27 – 28 November , taking over from Italian submarine patrols . If damaged , they were to sail to La <unk> , and enter under an Italian ensign . U @-@ 33 operated around Alicante , and U @-@ 34 around Cartagena . Difficulties in identifying legitimate targets and concerns about discovery limited their operations . The torpedoes they used also often malfunctioned . During their return to Wilhelmshaven in December , the Spanish Republican submarine C @-@ 3 was sunk ; the Germans claimed this was due to a torpedo fired from U @-@ 34 , although the Republicans ' enquiry claimed its loss was due to an internal explosion . Their return marked the official end of Operation Ursula . However , it does seem that further submarines were sent in mid @-@ 1937 , but details of the operation are not known ; six ( U @-@ 25 , U @-@ 26 , U @-@ 27 , U @-@ 28 , U @-@ 31 and U @-@ 35 ) are believed to have been involved . Five submarine commanders received the Spanish Cross in Bronze without Swords in 1939 . 
 = = Outcome = = 
 Early intervention helped to ensure that the Nationalist faction survived the initial stages of the war ; German involvement then steadily expanded . The training they provided to Nationalist force proved as valuable , if not more so , than direct actions . Approximately 56 @,@ 000 Nationalist soldiers were trained by various German detachments in Spain , who were technically proficient ; these covered infantry , tanks and anti @-@ tank units , air and anti @-@ aircraft forces , and those trained in naval warfare . 
 The Condor Legion spearheaded many Nationalist victories , particularly providing air dominance from 1937 onwards ; 300 air @-@ to @-@ air victories were claimed , although this was dwarfed by some 900 claimed by Italian forces . Spain provided a proving ground for German tank tactics , as well as aircraft tactics , the latter being only moderately successful . The air superiority which allowed certain parts of the Legion to excel would be replicated in the first year of World War II , until ultimately failing to prevail in the Battle of Britain . 
 A total of approximately 16 @,@ 000 German citizens fought in the Civil War , mostly as pilots , ground crew , artillery men , tank crew , and as military advisers and instructors . About 10 @,@ 000 Germans was the maximum strength at any one time . Approximately 300 Germans were killed . During the course of the war , Germany sent 732 combat aircraft and 110 trainer aircraft to Spain . German aid to the Nationalists amounted to approximately £ 43 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( $ 215 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ) in 1939 prices . This was broken down in expenditure to : 15 @.@ 5 % used for salaries and expenses , 21 @.@ 9 % used for direct delivery of supplies to Spain , and 62 @.@ 6 % expended on the Condor Legion . No detailed list of German supplies furnished to Spain has been found . Franco had also agreed to sign over the output of six mines to help pay for German aid . 
 = HMS Resistance ( 1861 ) = 
 HMS Resistance was the second of two Defence @-@ class ironclads built for the Royal Navy in the 1860s . She was the first capital ship in the Royal Navy to be fitted with a ram and was given the nickname of Old <unk> . Resistance was initially assigned to the Channel Fleet upon commissioning , but was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1864 , the first ironclad to be assigned to that fleet . She was rearmed in 1867 and became a guardship when recommissioned in 1869 . The ship was reassigned to the Channel Fleet in 1873 before reverting to her former duties in 1877 . Resistance was decommissioned in 1880 and was used for gunnery and torpedo trials beginning in 1885 . The ship was sold for scrap in 1898 and foundered in 1899 en route to the breaker 's yard . She was salvaged and later scrapped . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Defence @-@ class ironclads were designed as smaller and cheaper versions of the Warrior @-@ class armoured frigates . This meant that they could not fit the same powerful engines of the Warrior @-@ class ships and were therefore 2 knots ( 3 @.@ 7 km / h ; 2 @.@ 3 mph ) slower and had far fewer guns . The naval architect Sir Nathaniel Barnaby , a future Constructor of the Navy , considered that , in terms of combat , a Defence @-@ class ship was worth one quarter of a Warrior . 
 HMS Resistance was 280 feet ( 85 @.@ 3 m ) long between perpendiculars and 291 feet 4 inches ( 88 @.@ 80 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 54 feet 2 inches ( 16 @.@ 51 m ) and a draft of 26 feet 2 inches ( 8 @.@ 0 m ) . The ship displaced 6 @,@ 070 long tons ( 6 @,@ 170 t ) and had a ram in the shape of a plough , the first capital ship in the Royal Navy to be fitted with one . The hull was subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads into 92 compartments and had a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms . Resistance was 128 feet 8 inches ( 39 @.@ 2 m ) shorter overall and displaced over 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) less than the Warrior @-@ class ironclads . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Defence @-@ class ships had a single two @-@ cylinder trunk steam engine made by John Penn and Sons driving a single 21 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) propeller . Four rectangular boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of 20 psi ( 138 kPa ; 1 kgf / cm2 ) . The engine produced a total of 2 @,@ 329 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 737 kW ) . During sea trials on 25 August 1873 , Resistance had a maximum speed of 11 @.@ 4 knots ( 21 @.@ 1 km / h ; 13 @.@ 1 mph ) . The ship carried 450 long tons ( 460 t ) of coal , enough to steam 1 @,@ 670 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 090 km ; 1 @,@ 920 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ironclad was ship rigged and had a sail area of 24 @,@ 500 square feet ( 2 @,@ 276 m2 ) . The lower masts and bowsprit were made of iron to withstand the shock of ramming . Resistance could make about 10 @.@ 5 knots ( 19 @.@ 4 km / h ; 12 @.@ 1 mph ) under sail and the funnel was semi @-@ retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail alone . The ship 's propeller could be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail . She was re @-@ rigged as a barque from September 1864 to April 1866 before returning to her original ship rig . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The armament of the Defence @-@ class ships was intended to be 18 smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 68 @-@ pounder guns , eight on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck , plus four rifled breech @-@ loading 40 @-@ pounder guns as saluting guns . This was modified during construction to six rifled 110 @-@ pounder breech @-@ loading guns , ten 68 @-@ pounders and two 32 @-@ pounder smoothbore guns , the only such weapons ever mounted in a British ironclad . Both breech @-@ loading guns were new designs from Armstrong and much was hoped of them . Four of the 110 @-@ pounder guns were installed on the main deck amidships and the other two became chase guns ; all of the 68 @-@ pounder guns were mounted on the main deck . Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target , however , proved that the 110 @-@ pounder was inferior to the 68 @-@ pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863 – 64 caused the navy to begin to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards . 
 The 7 @.@ 9 @-@ inch ( 201 mm ) solid shot of the 68 @-@ pounder gun weighed approximately 68 pounds ( 30 @.@ 8 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 10 @,@ 640 pounds ( 4 @,@ 826 @.@ 2 kg ) . The gun had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 579 ft / s ( 481 m / s ) and had a range of 3 @,@ 200 yards ( 2 @,@ 900 m ) at an elevation of 12 ° . The 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) shell of the 110 @-@ pounder Armstrong breech @-@ loader weighed 107 – 110 pounds ( 48 @.@ 5 – 49 @.@ 9 kg ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 150 ft / s ( 350 m / s ) and , at an elevation of 11 @.@ 25 ° , a maximum range of 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) . The 110 @-@ pounder gun weighed 9 @,@ 520 pounds ( 4 @,@ 318 @.@ 2 kg ) while the 40 @-@ pounder weighed 3 @,@ 584 pounds ( 1 @,@ 625 @.@ 7 kg ) . All of the guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . 
 Resistance was rearmed during her 1867 – 68 refit with fourteen 7 @-@ inch and two 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . The new guns were heavier so fewer could be carried . The shell of the 15 @-@ calibre 8 @-@ inch gun weighed 175 pounds ( 79 @.@ 4 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 9 long tons ( 9 @.@ 1 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 410 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 9 @.@ 6 inches ( 244 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The 16 @-@ calibre 7 @-@ inch gun weighed 6 @.@ 5 long tons ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) and fired a 112 pounds ( 50 @.@ 8 kg ) shell . It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate 7 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 196 mm ) armour . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The Defence @-@ class ships had a wrought iron armour belt , 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick , that covered 140 feet ( 42 @.@ 7 m ) amidships . The armour extended from upper deck level to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) below the waterline . 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads protected the guns on the main deck . The armour was backed by 18 inches ( 460 mm ) of teak . The ends of the ship were left entirely unprotected which meant that the steering gear was very vulnerable . They were , however , sub @-@ divided into many watertight compartments to minimize any flooding . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 HMS Resistance was ordered on 14 December 1859 and laid down a week later by Westwood , Baillie at their shipyard in Cubitt Town , London . She was launched on 11 April 1861 , commissioned in July 1862 and completed on 5 October at the cost of £ 258 @,@ 120 . After completion she served in the Channel Fleet until 1864 when she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet , the first British ironclad assigned to that fleet . In 1867 the ship was paid off in Portsmouth for refit and re @-@ armament . Resistance recommissioned in 1869 as guardship in the River Mersey and served there until 1873 when she returned to the Channel Fleet . In 1877 the ship resumed her post as Mersey guardship until she was paid off in 1880 at Devonport . 
 In 1885 Resistance began to be used as a target for the testing of armour against the effects of torpedoes and gunfire . She was sold for scrap on 11 November 1898 . She foundered in Holyhead Bay whilst under tow to the breakers on 4 March 1899 and was later raised and scrapped at Garston , Liverpool . 
 = Microgale macpheei = 
 Microgale macpheei is an extinct shrew tenrec from southeastern Madagascar . It is known only from two partial skulls found in Andrahomana cave , which radiocarbon dating of associated rodent remains suggests are about 2000 years old . It is the only known recently extinct tenrec . First described in 2007 , it is most similar to the smaller Microgale brevicaudata of northern and western Madagascar . M. macpheei has a broad rostrum ( front part of the skull ) and , like M. brevicaudata , lacks a diastema ( gap ) between the premolars . A number of details of tooth morphology are characteristic of M. macpheei . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Remains of shrew tenrecs ( Microgale ) were found during expeditions to the cave of Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar , led by David Burney in 2000 and 2003 . The Microgale material was described as a new species , M. macpheei , in 2007 by Steven Goodman , Natalie Vasey , and Burney . The species was named after Ross MacPhee in honor of his contributions to knowledge of the genus Microgale and the paleontology of Madagascar . Goodman and colleagues considered the living Microgale brevicaudata from northern and western Madagascar to be the closest relative of M. macpheei ; some populations of this tenrec have since been separated into a different species , M. grandidieri . The common name " MacPhee 's shrew tenrec " has been proposed for M. macpheei . The genus of M. macpheei , Microgale , includes more than 20 species and is the largest of the tenrec family , which includes a variety of other Madagascan mammals . 
 = = Description = = 
 Microgale macpheei is known from two specimens : a damaged cranium ( skull without mandibles , or lower jaws ) lacking the back part ( the parietal bones and further back ) as well as the incisors , canines , and second premolars ; and another damaged cranium lacking the same parts as well as the left toothrow . Both show no evidence of ongoing tooth replacement , indicating that the permanent dentition is complete . M. macpheei was larger in most measurements than M. brevicaudata , but because of small samples , some differences are not statistically significant . The length of the bony palate in the two specimens of M. macpheei is 9 @.@ 4 and 9 @.@ 7 mm , compared to 7 @.@ 1 to 9 @.@ 0 mm in eight adult M. brevicaudata . In both specimens , the length of the molar row is 3 @.@ 0 mm , compared to 2 @.@ 4 to 2 @.@ 8 mm in the sample of M. brevicaudata . 
 The rostrum ( front part of the skull ) is short and blunt in both M. macpheei and M. brevicaudata , contrasting with the condition in other Microgale , but the rostrum of M. brevicaudata is distinctly more tapered at the front , whereas that of M. macpheei is more blunt at the front . Unlike other Microgale , M. brevicaudata and M. macpheei lack gaps ( diastemata ) between the premolars . M. macpheei had larger , more robust teeth than M. brevicaudata . In both species , the <unk> and <unk> , two crests , on the fourth premolar ( P4 ) and the molars are reduced relative to the condition in other Microgale . M. macpheei lacks an extension of the protocone cusp on the lingual ( inner ) side of the third upper premolar ( P3 ) and P4 , present in M. brevicaudata , and has the paracone cusp on P4 less well @-@ developed . On the other hand , the front part of the <unk> crest on P4 is larger . The relative lengths of some of the crests on the two last molars also differ between the two species . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 Microgale macpheei is known only from the cave of Andrahomana . Its past presence there , like that of the extinct rodent Hypogeomys australis , suggests formerly more mesic ( wet ) conditions around the cave , which is currently in a dry area . In addition to M. macpheei , three other tenrecs have been described from subfossil material , but none are currently recognized as valid species ; thus , M. macpheei is at present the only known Recently extinct tenrec species . However , there is a remnant patch of mesic forest near Andrahomana , where a population of M. macpheei may survive . Although no radiocarbon dating has been carried out on M. macpheei remains , bones of the rodent Macrotarsomys petteri from layers in the same cave deposit bracketing those where M. macpheei was found yield dates of around <unk> and 1760 Before Present . 
 = Rules of chess = 
 The rules of chess ( also known as the laws of chess ) are rules governing the play of the game of chess . While the exact origins of chess are unclear , modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages . The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century , when they reached essentially their current form . The rules also varied somewhat from place to place . Today chess 's international governing body FIDE ( Fédération Internationale des Échecs ) sets the standard rules , with slight modifications made by some national organizations for their own purposes . There are variations of the rules for fast chess , correspondence chess , online chess , and chess variants . 
 Chess is a game played by two people on a chessboard , with sixteen pieces ( of six types ) for each player . Each type of piece moves in a distinct way . The goal of the game is to checkmate , that is , to threaten the opponent 's king with inevitable capture . Games do not necessarily end with checkmate – players often resign if they believe they will lose . In addition , there are several ways that a game can end in a draw . 
 Besides the basic movement of the pieces , rules also govern the equipment used , the time control , the conduct and ethics of players , accommodations for physically challenged players , the recording of moves using chess notation , as well as provide procedures for resolving irregularities which can occur during a game . 
 = = Initial setup = = 
 Chess is played on a chessboard , a square board divided into 64 squares ( eight @-@ by @-@ eight ) of alternating color , which is similar to that used in draughts ( checkers ) ( FIDE 2008 ) . No matter what the actual colors of the board , the lighter @-@ colored squares are called " light " or " white " , and the darker @-@ colored squares are called " dark " or " black " . Sixteen " white " and sixteen " black " pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game . The board is placed so that a white square is in each player 's near @-@ right corner . Horizontal rows are called ranks and vertical rows are called files . 
 Each player controls sixteen pieces : 
 At the beginning of the game , the pieces are arranged as shown in the diagram : for each side one king , one queen , two rooks , two bishops , two knights , and eight pawns . The pieces are placed , one on a square , as follows : 
 The rooks are placed on the outside corners , right and left edge . 
 The knights are placed immediately inside of the rooks . 
 The bishops are placed immediately inside of the knights . 
 The queen is placed on the central square of the same color of that of the player : white queen on the white square and black queen on the black square . 
 The king takes the vacant spot next to the queen . 
 The pawns are placed one square in front of all of the other pieces . 
 Popular mnemonics used to remember the setup are " queen on her own color " and " white on right " . The latter refers to setting up the board so that the square closest to each player 's right is white ( Schiller 2003 : 16 – 17 ) . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player controlling the white pieces is named " White " ; the player controlling the black pieces is named " Black " . White moves first , then players alternate moves . Making a move is required ; it is not legal to skip a move , even when having to move is detrimental . Play continues until a king is checkmated , a player resigns , or a draw is declared , as explained below . In addition , if the game is being played under a time control players who exceed their time limit lose the game . 
 The official chess rules do not include a procedure for determining who plays White . Instead , this decision is left open to tournament @-@ specific rules ( e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round @-@ robin tournament ) or , in the case of non @-@ competitive play , mutual agreement , in which case some kind of random choice is often employed . A common method is for one player to conceal a piece ( usually a pawn ) of each color in either hand ; the other player chooses a hand to open and reveal their color . Play then commences with white . 
 = = = Movement = = = 
 = = = = Basic moves = = = = 
 Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement . A piece moves to a vacant square except when capturing an opponent 's piece . 
 Except for any move of the knight and castling , pieces cannot jump over other pieces . A piece is captured ( or taken ) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square ( en passant is the only exception ) . The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game . The king can be put in check but cannot be captured ( see below ) . 
 The king moves exactly one square horizontally , vertically , or diagonally . A special move with the king known as castling is allowed only once per player , per game ( see below ) . 
 A rook moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal or vertical direction . It also is moved when castling . 
 A bishop moves any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction . 
 The queen moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal , vertical , or diagonal direction . 
 A knight moves to the nearest square not on the same rank , file , or diagonal . ( This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically , or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically — i.e. in an " L " pattern . ) The knight is not blocked by other pieces : it jumps to the new location . 
 Pawns have the most complex rules of movement : 
 A pawn moves straight forward one square , if that square is vacant . If it has not yet moved , a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward , provided both squares are vacant . Pawns cannot move backwards . 
 Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move . A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn ( but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant ) . 
 The pawn is also involved in the two special moves en passant and promotion ( Schiller 2003 : 17 – 19 ) . 
 = = = = Castling = = = = 
 Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook , then placing the rook on the other side of the king , adjacent to it . Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold : 
 The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved ; 
 There must be no pieces between the king and the rook ; 
 The king may not currently be in check , nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece ( though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square ) ; 
 The king and the rook must be on the same rank ( Schiller 2003 : 19 ) . 
 = = = = En passant = = = = 
 When a pawn advances two squares from its original square and ends the turn adjacent to a pawn of the opponent 's on the same rank , it may be captured by that pawn of the opponent 's , as if it had moved only one square forward . This capture is only legal on the opponent 's next move immediately following the first pawn 's advance . The diagrams on the right demonstrate an instance of this : if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4 , the black pawn on b4 can capture it en passant , moving from b4 to a3 while the white pawn on a4 is removed from the board . 
 = = = = Pawn promotion = = = = 
 If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank , the pawn is then promoted ( converted ) to a queen , rook , bishop , or knight of the same color at the choice of the player ( a queen is usually chosen ) . The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces . Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks , bishops , or knights if all of their pawns are promoted . If the desired piece is not available , the player should call the arbiter to provide the piece ( Schiller 2003 : 17 – 19 ) . 
 = = = Check = = = 
 A king is in check when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece . A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check ( it is pinned against its own king ) may still deliver check to the opposing player . 
 A player may not make any move which places or leaves his king in check . The possible ways to get out of check are : 
 Move the king to a square where it is not threatened . 
 Capture the threatening piece ( possibly with the king ) . 
 Block the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent 's threatening piece ( Just 2014 ) , ( Polgar & Truong 2005 : 32 @,@ 103 ) , ( Burgess 2009 : 550 ) . 
 If it is not possible to get out of check , the king is checkmated and the game is over ( see the next section ) . 
 In informal games , it is customary to announce " check " when making a move that puts the opponent 's king in check . However , in formal competitions check is rarely announced ( Just 2014 ) . 
 = = Competition rules = = 
 These rules apply to games played " over the board " . There are special rules for correspondence chess , blitz chess , computer chess , and for handicapped players . 
 = = = Act of moving the pieces = = = 
 The movement of pieces is to be done with one hand . Once the hand is taken off a piece after moving it , the move cannot be retracted unless the move is illegal . When castling , the player should first move the king with one hand and then move the rook with the same hand ( Schiller 2003 : 19 – 20 ) . 
 In the case of a pawn promotion , if the player releases the pawn on the eighth rank , the player must promote the pawn . After the pawn has moved , the player may touch any piece not on the board and the promotion is not finalized until the new piece is released on the promotion square ( Just 2014 ) . 
 = = = Touch @-@ move rule = = = 
 In serious play , if a player having the move touches a piece as if having the intention of moving it , then the player must move it if it can be legally moved . So long as the hand has not left the piece on a new square , any legal move can be made with the piece . If a player touches one of the opponent 's pieces then that piece must be captured if there is a legal move that does so . If none of the touched pieces can be moved or captured there is no penalty ( Schiller 2003 : 19 – 20 ) . 
 When castling , the king must be the first piece touched . If the player touches the rook at the same time as touching the king , the player must castle with that rook if it is legal to do so . If the player completes a two @-@ square king move without touching a rook , the player must move the correct rook accordingly if castling in that direction is legal . If a player starts to castle illegally , another legal king move must be made if possible , including castling with the other rook ( Schiller 2003 : 20 ) . 
 If a player moves a pawn to its eighth rank , it cannot be substituted for a different move of the pawn when the player has stopped touching it . However , the move is not complete until the promoted piece is released on that square . 
 If a player wishes to touch a piece with the intention of adjusting its position on a square , the player must first alert the opponent of this intention by saying J <unk> or " I adjust " . Once the game has started , only the player with the move may touch the pieces on the board ( Schiller 2003 : 19 – 20 ) . 
 = = = Timing = = = 
 Tournament games are played under time constraints , called time controls , using a chess clock . Each player must make his moves within the time control or forfeit the game . There are different types of time controls . In some cases each player will have a certain amount of time to make a certain number of moves . In other cases each player will have a limited amount of time to make all of his moves . Also , the player may gain a small amount of additional time for each move made , either by a small increment added for each move made , or by the clock delaying a small amount of time each time it is started after the opponent 's move ( Schiller 2003 : 21 – 24 ) . 
 If a player delivers a checkmate , the game is over and that player wins , no matter what is subsequently noticed about the time on the clock . 
 If player A calls attention to player B being out of time while player A is not out of time and some sequence of legal moves leads to B being checkmated then player A wins automatically . 
 If player A does not have the possibility of <unk> B then the game is a draw ( Schiller 2003 : 28 ) . 
 The United States Chess Federation ( USCF ) rule is different . USCF Rule 14E defines " insufficient material to win on time " , that is lone king , king plus knight , king plus bishop , and king plus two knights opposed by no pawns , and there is no forced win in the final position . Hence to win on time with this material , the USCF rule requires that a win can be forced from that position , while the FIDE rule merely requires a win to be possible . ( See Monika <unk> rules appeal in 2008 and Women 's World Chess Championship 2008 for a famous instance of this rule . ) 
 If a player is out of time and also calls attention to his opponent running out of time , then : 
 If a sudden death time control is not being used , the game continues in the next time control period ( Schiller 2003 : 23 ) . 
 if the game is played under a sudden death time control , then if it can be established which player ran out of time first , the game is lost by that player ; otherwise the game is drawn ( Schiller 2003 : 29 ) . 
 If a player believes that his opponent is attempting to win the game on time and not by normal means ( i.e. checkmate ) , if it is a sudden death time control and the player has less than two minutes remaining , the player may stop the clocks and claim a draw with the arbiter . The arbiter may declare the game a draw or postpone the decision and allot the opponent two extra minutes ( Schiller 2003 : 21 – 24 @,@ 29 ) . 
 = = = Recording moves = = = 
 Each square of the chessboard is identified with a unique pair of a letter and a number . The vertical files are labeled a through h , from White 's left ( i.e. the queenside ) to White 's right . Similarly , the horizontal ranks are numbered from 1 to 8 , starting from the one nearest White 's side of the board . Each square of the board , then , is uniquely identified by its file letter and rank number . The white king , for example , starts the game on square e1 . The black knight on b8 can move to a6 or c6 . 
 In formal competition , each player is obliged to record each move as it is played in a chess notation in order to settle disputes about illegal positions , overstepping time control , and making claims of draws by the fifty @-@ move rule or repetition of position . Algebraic chess notation is the accepted standard for recording games today . There are other systems such as ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and the obsolete descriptive chess notation . The current rule is that a move must be made on the board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device . 
 Both players should indicate offers of a draw by writing " = " at that move on their scoresheet ( Schiller 2003 : 27 ) . Notations about the time on the clocks can be made . If a player has less than five minutes left to complete all of their moves , they are not required to record the moves ( unless a delay of at least thirty seconds per move is being used ) . The scoresheet must be made available to the arbiter at all times . A player may respond to an opponent 's move before writing it down ( Schiller 2003 : 25 – 26 ) . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 See <unk> Chess . 
 = = = Irregularities = = = 
 = = = = Illegal move = = = = 
 A player who makes an illegal move must retract that move and make a legal move . That move must be made with the same piece if possible , because the touch @-@ move rule applies . If the illegal move was an attempt to castle , the touch @-@ move rule applies to the king but not to the rook . The arbiter should adjust the time on the clock according to the best evidence . If the mistake is only noticed later on , the game should be restarted from the position in which the error occurred ( Schiller 2003 : 24 – 25 ) . Some regional organizations have different rules . 
 If blitz chess is being played ( in which both players have a small , limited time , e.g. five minutes ) the rule varies . A player may correct an illegal move if the player has not pressed their clock . If a player has pressed their clock , the opponent may claim a win if he or she hasn 't moved . If the opponent moves , the illegal move is accepted and without penalty ( Schiller 2003 : 77 ) . 
 According to the FIDE Laws of Chess , the first completed illegal move is penalized by awarding the opponent two additional minutes on the clock . The second completed illegal move by the same player results in the loss of the game , unless the position is such that it is impossible for the opponent to win by any series of legal moves ( e.g. if the opponent has a bare king ) in which case the game is drawn . A move is completed when it has been made and the player has pressed the clock . In rapid chess and blitz chess , the first completed illegal move results in a loss . 
 = = = = Illegal position = = = = 
 If it is discovered during the game that the starting position was incorrect , the game is restarted . If it is discovered during the game that the board is oriented incorrectly , the game is continued with the pieces transferred to a correctly oriented board . If the game starts with the colors of the pieces reversed , the game continues ( unless the arbiter rules otherwise ) ( Schiller 2003 : 24 ) . Some regional organizations have different rules . 
 If a player knocks over pieces , it is their responsibility to restore them to their correct position on their time . If it is discovered that an illegal move has been made , or that pieces have been displaced , the game is restored to the position before the irregularity . If that position cannot be determined , the game is restored to the last known correct position ( Schiller 2003 : 24 – 25 ) . 
 = = = Conduct = = = 
 Players may not use any notes , outside sources of information ( including computers ) , or advice from other people . Analysis on another board is not permitted . <unk> are to record objective facts about the game only , such as time on the clock or draw offers . Players may not leave the competition area without permission of the arbiter ( Schiller 2003 : 30 – 31 ) . 
 High standards of etiquette and ethics are expected . Players should shake hands before and after the game . Generally a player should not speak during the game , except to offer a draw , resign , or to call attention to an irregularity . An announcement of " check " is made in amateur games but should not be used in officially sanctioned games . A player may not distract or annoy another player by any means , including repeatedly offering a draw ( Schiller 2003 : 30 – 31 @,@ 49 – 52 ) . 
 Due to increasing concerns about the use of chess engines and outside communication , in 2014 FIDE banned all mobile phones from the playing area during chess competitions , under penalty of forfeiture of the game or even expulsion from the tournament . However , the rules also allow for less rigid enforcement in amateur events . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 The size of the squares of the chessboard should be approximately 1 @.@ 25 to 1 @.@ 3 times the diameter of the base of the king , or 50 to 65 mm . Squares of approximately 57 mm ( 2 1 ⁄ 4 inches ) normally are well @-@ suited for pieces with the kings in the preferred size range . The darker squares are usually brown or green and the lighter squares are off @-@ white or buff . 
 Pieces of the Staunton chess set design are the standard and are usually made of wood or plastic . They are often black and white ; other colors may be used ( like a dark wood or even red for the dark pieces ) but they would still be called the " white " and " black " pieces ( see White and Black in chess ) . The height of the king should be 85 to 105 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 35 – 4 @.@ 13 inches ) . A height of approximately 95 to 102 mm ( 3 3 ⁄ 4 – 4 inches ) is preferred by most players . The diameter of the king should be 40 to 50 % of its height . The size of the other pieces should be in proportion to the king . The pieces should be well balanced ( Just 2014 ) . 
 In games subject to time control , a chess clock is used , consisting of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other , such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously . The clock can be analog or digital though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets . This is since most tournaments now include either a time delay ( a countdown to when a clock starts again ) or add ( extra time being added prior or after the move ) to their time controls . Before the start of the game , either the arbiter decides , or whomever is playing Black , where the chess clock is placed . 
 = = End of the game = = 
 = = = Checkmate = = = 
 If a player 's king is placed in check and there is no legal move that player can make to escape check , then the king is said to be checkmated , the game ends , and that player loses ( Schiller 2003 : 20 – 21 ) . Unlike other pieces , the king is never actually captured or removed from the board because checkmate ends the game ( Burgess 2009 : 502 ) . 
 The diagram shows an example checkmate position . The white king is threatened by the black queen ; the square to which the king could move is also threatened ; it cannot capture the queen , because it would then be in check by the rook . 
 = = = Resigning = = = 
 Either player may resign at any time and their opponent wins the game . This normally happens when the player believes he or she is very likely to lose the game . A player may resign by saying it verbally or by indicating it on their scoresheet in any of three ways : ( 1 ) by writing " resigns " , ( 2 ) by circling the result of the game , or ( 3 ) by writing " 1 – 0 " if Black resigns or " 0 – 1 " if White resigns ( Schiller 2003 : 21 ) . Tipping over the king also indicates resignation , but it is not frequently used ( and should be distinguished from accidentally knocking the king over ) . Stopping both clocks is not an indication of resigning , since clocks can be stopped to call the arbiter . An offer of a handshake is not necessarily a resignation either , since one player could think they are agreeing to a draw ( Just 2014 ) . 
 = = = Draws = = = 
 The game ends in a draw if any of these conditions occur : 
 The game is automatically a draw if the player to move is not in check but has no legal move . This situation is called a stalemate . An example of such a position is shown in the diagram to the right . 
 The game is immediately drawn when there is no possibility of checkmate for either side with any series of legal moves . This draw is often due to insufficient material , including the endgames 
 king against king ; 
 king against king and bishop ; 
 king against king and knight ; 
 king and bishop against king and bishop , with both bishops on squares of the same color ( see Checkmate # Unusual mates ) . 
 Both players agree to a draw after one of the players makes such an offer . 
 The player having the move may claim a draw by declaring that one of the following conditions exists , or by declaring an intention to make a move which will bring about one of these conditions : 
 Fifty @-@ move rule : There has been no capture or pawn move in the last fifty moves by each player . 
 Threefold repetition : The same board position has occurred three times with the same player to move and all pieces having the same rights to move , including the right to castle or capture en passant . 
 If the claim is proven true , the game is drawn ( Schiller 2003 : 21 @,@ 26 – 28 ) . 
 At one time , if a player was able to check the opposing king continually ( perpetual check ) and the player indicated their intention to do so , the game was drawn . This rule is no longer in effect ; however , players will usually agree to a draw in such a situation , since either the rule on threefold repetition or the fifty @-@ move rule will eventually be applicable ( Staunton 1847 : 21 – 22 ) , ( Reinfeld 1954 : 175 ) . 
 = = = Time control = = = 
 A game played under time control will end as a loss for a player who uses up all of their allotted time , unless the opponent cannot possibly checkmate him ( see the Timing section above ) . There are different types of time control . Players may have a fixed amount of time for the entire game or they may have to make a certain number of moves within a specified time . Also , a small increment of time may be added for each move made . 
 = = History = = 
 The rules of chess have evolved much over the centuries from the early chess @-@ like games played in India in the 6th century . For much of that time the rules have varied from area to area . The modern rules first took form in Italy during the 13th century , giving more mobility to pieces that previously had more restricted movement ( such as the queen and bishop ) . Such modified rules entered into an accepted form during the late 15th century ( Hooper & Whyld 1992 : 41 @,@ 328 ) or early 16th century ( Ruch 2004 ) . The basic moves of the king , rook , and knight are unchanged . Pawns originally did not have the option of moving two squares on their first move and promoted only to a queen if they reached the eighth rank . The queen was originally the <unk> or <unk> , which could move one square diagonally in any direction . In European chess it became able to leap two squares diagonally , forwards , backwards , or to left or right on its first move ; some area also gave this right to a newly promoted pawn . In the Persian and Arabic game the bishop was a <unk> ( Persian ) or <unk> ( Arabic ) ( meaning " elephant " ) which moved two squares diagonally with jump ( Davidson 1949 : 13 ) . In the Middle Ages the pawn could only be promoted to the equivalent of a queen ( which at that time was the weakest piece ) if it reached its eighth rank ( Davidson 1949 : 59 – 61 ) . During the 12th century the squares on the board sometimes alternated colors , and this became the standard in the 13th century ( Davidson 1949 : 146 ) , whence the word " chequered " / " checkered " . 
 Between 1200 and 1600 several laws emerged that drastically altered the game . Checkmate became a requirement to win ; a player could not win by capturing all of the opponent 's pieces . Stalemate was added , although the outcome has changed several times ( see History of the stalemate rule ) . Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move , and the en passant rule was a natural consequence of that new option . The king and rook acquired the right to castle ( see Variations throughout history of castling for different versions of the rule ) . 
 Between 1475 and 1500 the queen and the bishop also acquired their current moves , which made them much stronger pieces ( Davidson 1949 : 14 – 17 ) . When all of these changes were accepted the game was in essentially its modern form ( Davidson 1949 : 14 – 17 ) . 
 The rules for pawn promotion have changed several times . As stated above , originally the pawn could only be promoted to the queen , which at that time was a weak piece . When the queen acquired its current move and became the most powerful piece , the pawn could then be promoted to a queen or a rook , bishop , or knight . In the 18th century rules allowed only the promotion to a piece already captured , e.g. the rules published in 1749 by François @-@ André Danican Philidor . In the 19th century this restriction was lifted , which allowed for a player to have more than one queen , e.g. the 1828 rules by Jacob <unk> ( Davidson 1949 : 59 – 61 ) . 
 Two new rules concerning draws were introduced , each of which have changed through the years : 
 The threefold repetition rule was added , although at some times up to six repetitions have been required , and the exact conditions have been specified more clearly ( see Threefold repetition # History ) . 
 The fifty @-@ move rule was also added . At various times , the number of moves required was different , such as 24 , 60 , 70 , or 75 . For several years in the 20th century , the standard fifty moves was extended to one hundred moves for a few specific endgames ( see Fifty @-@ move rule 's history ) . 
 Another group of new laws included ( 1 ) the touch @-@ move rule and the accompanying " j <unk> / adjust " rule ; ( 2 ) that White moves first ( in 1889 ) ; ( 3 ) the orientation of the board ; ( 4 ) the procedure if an illegal move was made ; ( 5 ) the procedure if the king had been left in check for some moves ; and ( 6 ) issues regarding the behavior of players and spectators . The Staunton chess set was introduced in 1849 and it became the standard style of pieces . The size of pieces and squares of the board was standardized ( Hooper & Whyld 1992 : 220 – 21 , laws , history of ) . 
 Until the middle of the 19th century , chess games were played without any time limit . In an 1834 match between Alexander McDonnell and Louis @-@ Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais , McDonnell took an inordinate amount of time to move , sometimes up to 1 ½ hours . In 1836 Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint @-@ Amant suggested a time limit , but no action was taken . At the 1851 London tournament , Staunton blamed his loss in his match against Elijah Williams on Williams ' slow play ; one game was adjourned for the day after only 29 moves . The next year a match between Daniel Harrwitz and Johann Löwenthal used a limit of 20 minutes per <unk> first use of a modern @-@ style time limit was in an 1861 match between Adolph Anderssen and Ignác Kolisch ( <unk> 1970 : 459 ) .

 The first known publication of chess rules was in a book by Luis Ramírez de Lucena about 1497 , shortly after the movement of the queen , bishop , and pawn were changed to their modern form ( Just 2014 ) . In the 16th and 17th centuries , there were differences of opinion concerning rules such as castling , pawn promotion , stalemate , and en passant . Some of these differences existed until the 19th century ( Harkness 1967 : 3 ) . Ruy López de Segura gave rules of chess in his 1561 book Libro de la <unk> liberal y arte del juego del <unk> ( <unk> 1970 : 294 ) . 
 As chess clubs arose and tournaments became common , there was a need to formalize the rules . In 1749 Philidor ( 1726 – 1795 ) wrote a set of rules that were widely used , as well as rules by later writers such as the 1828 rules by Jacob <unk> ( 1772 – 1819 ) and rules by George Walker ( 1803 – 1879 ) . In the 19th century , many major clubs published their own rules , including The Hague in 1803 , London in 1807 , Paris in 1836 , and St. Petersburg in 1854 . In 1851 Howard Staunton ( 1810 – 1874 ) called for a " Constituent Assembly for Remodeling the Laws of Chess " and proposals by Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa ( 1818 – 1889 ) were published in 1854 . Staunton had published rules in Chess Player 's Handbook in 1847 , and his new proposals were published in 1860 in Chess Praxis ; they were generally accepted in English @-@ speaking countries . German @-@ speaking countries usually used the writings of chess authority Johann Berger ( 1845 – 1933 ) or Handbuch des Schachspiels by Paul Rudolf von Bilguer ( 1815 – 1840 ) , first published in 1843 . 
 In 1924 , Fédération Internationale des Échecs ( FIDE ) was formed and in 1929 it took up the task of standardizing the rules . At first FIDE tried to establish a universal set of rules , but translations to various languages differed slightly . Although FIDE rules were used for international competition under their control , some countries continued to use their own rules internally ( Hooper & Whyld 1992 : 220 – 21 ) . In 1952 FIDE created the Permanent Commission for the Rules of Chess ( also known as the Rules Commission ) and published a new edition of the rules . The third official edition of the laws was published in 1966 . The first three editions of the rules were published in French , with that as the official version . In 1974 FIDE published the English version of the rules ( which was based on an authorized 1955 translation ) . With that edition , English became the official language of the rules . Another edition was published in 1979 . Throughout this time , ambiguities in the laws were handed by frequent interpretations that the Rules Commission published as supplements and amendments . In 1982 the Rules Commission rewrote the laws to incorporate the interpretations and amendments ( FIDE 1989 : 7 – 8 ) . In 1984 FIDE abandoned the idea of a universal set of laws , although FIDE rules are the standard for high @-@ level play ( Hooper & Whyld 1992 : 220 – 21 ) . With the 1984 edition , FIDE implemented a four @-@ year moratorium between changes to the rules . Other editions were issued in 1988 and 1992 ( FIDE 1989 : 5 ) , ( Just 2014 ) . 
 The rules of national FIDE affiliates ( such as the United States Chess Federation , or USCF ) are based on the FIDE rules , with slight variations ( Just 2014 ) . Kenneth Harkness published popular rulebooks in the United States starting in 1956 , and the USCF continues to publish rulebooks for use in tournaments it sanctions . 
 In 2008 FIDE added the variant Chess960 to the appendix of the laws of chess . Chess960 uses a random initial set @-@ up of main pieces , with the conditions that the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks , and bishops on opposite @-@ color squares . The castling rules are extended to cover all these positions . 
 In 2014 a rule about mobile phones was brought in : see # Conduct .

 One case of a minor extra rule being added for a particular match is " no drawing or resigning during the first 30 moves " in the London Chess Classic on 8 – 15 December 2009 at Olympia , London . 
 = Final Fantasy IX = 
 Final Fantasy IX ( <unk> , Fainaru Fantajī Nain ) is a role @-@ playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation video game console . Originally released in 2000 , it is the ninth title in the Final Fantasy series and last to debut on the original PlayStation console . In 2010 , it was re @-@ released as a PSone Classics title on the PlayStation Network . The game introduced new features to the series like the " Active Time Event " , " Mognet " , and a unique equipment and skill system . 
 Final Fantasy IX 's plot centers on a war between nations . Players follow a young thief named Zidane Tribal , who joins with others to defeat Queen Brahne of Alexandria , the one responsible for starting the war . The plot shifts , however , when the characters realise that Brahne is working with an even more threatening person called Kuja . 
 Final Fantasy IX was developed alongside Final Fantasy VIII , but took a different approach by returning to the more traditional style of the early Final Fantasy games . Consequently , Final Fantasy IX was influenced significantly by the original Final Fantasy game , and features allusions to other titles in the series . It was released to critical acclaim and holds the highest Metacritic score of all Final Fantasy installments . Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful , selling 5 @.@ 30 million units worldwide by March 31 , 2003 . 
 Ports for iOS and Android were released in February 2016 , while a port for Microsoft Windows was released in April 2016 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Final Fantasy IX , the player navigates a character throughout the game world , exploring areas and interacting with non @-@ player characters . Most of the game occurs in towns and dungeons which are referred to as " field screens " . To aid exploration on the field screen , Final Fantasy IX introduces the " field icon " , an exclamation mark appearing over their lead character 's head , signalling an item or sign is nearby . Players speak with moogles to record their progress , restore life energy with a tent and purchase items — a deviation from previous installments , which used a save point to perform these functions . Moogles may request the playable character deliver letters to other Moogles via Mognet , playable characters might also receive letters from non @-@ playable characters . 
 Players journey between field screen locations on the world map , a three dimensional , downsized representation of Final Fantasy IX 's world presented from a top @-@ down perspective . Players can freely navigate around the world map screen unless restricted by terrain like bodies of water or mountain ranges . To overcome geographical limitations , players can ride chocobos , sail on a boat or pilot airships . Like previous Final Fantasy installments , travel across the world map screen and hostile field screen locations is interrupted by random enemy encounters . 
 Final Fantasy IX offers a new approach to town exploration with the introduction of Active Time Events ( ATE ) . These allow the player to view events unfolding at different locations , providing character development , special items and prompts for key story @-@ altering decisions . ATE are occasionally used to simultaneously control two teams when the party is divided to solve puzzles and navigate mazes . 
 = = = Combat = = = 
 Whenever the playable character encounters an enemy , the map changes to the " battle screen " . On the battle screen , the enemy appears on the opposite side of the characters ; each battle uses the familiar Active Time Battle system that was first featured in Final Fantasy IV . The character 's command list is presented in a window opposite the ATB gauge list ; while all characters can physically attack the enemy or use an item from the player 's inventory , they also possess unique abilities . For example , the thief Zidane can steal items from the enemy , Eiko and Garnet can summon " eidolons " to aid the party and Vivi can use black magic to damage the opposition . 
 These character @-@ specific commands change when the player goes into " Trance mode " , which is activated for a short duration when an uncontrollable gauge fills as character sustains damage in a style similar to the Limit Breaks used in Final Fantasy VII . When the gauge is full , the character 's strength is amplified , and the player can select special attack commands . Zidane 's " Skill " command list , for example , changes to " Dyne " , allowing him to execute powerful attacks ; Vivi 's " Black Magic " command evolves into " Double Black " , allowing him to cast two magic spells simultaneously . Through the Configuration screen , the player can change the Battle Style from Normal to Custom , which allows two players to control any combination of characters during battle . However , two controllers must be plugged into the PlayStation . 
 A character 's performance in battle is determined by numerical values ( " statistics " ) for categories like speed , strength and magical power . Character statistics are driven by experience ; when players win battles , they are awarded " experience points " , which accumulate until characters gain " experience levels " . When characters " level up " , the statistics for their attributes permanently increase , which may also be amplified by the types of equipment the character is wearing . Winning battles also awards the player money ( Gil ) , Tetra Master playing cards , items and ability points ( AP ) . 
 = = = Abilities and equipment = = = 
 Final Fantasy IX deviates from the style of customisable characters featured in the last two titles by reviving the character class concept , which designates a character to a certain role in battle . For example , Vivi is designated as a black mage and is the only character who can use black magic , and Steiner is a knight and is the only character who can use sword skills . 
 The basic function of equipment in Final Fantasy games is to increase character attributes ; arming Zidane with a <unk> Vest , for example , increases his base defense statistic . In Final Fantasy IX , weapons and armor include special character abilities , which the character may use when the item is equipped ( permitting the ability matches their class ) . Once the character accumulates enough ability points in battle , the ability becomes usable without having to keep the item equipped . In addition to granting abilities the equipment in Final Fantasy IX determines the statistical growth of the characters at the time of level up . Armor not only raises base defense or evasion statistics but raises defense and / or other statistics at level up . 
 Abilities are classified into action and support categories . Action abilities consume magic points ( MP ) and include magic spells and special moves that are used in battle . Support abilities provide functions that remain in effect indefinitely and must be equipped with magic stones to be functional . The maximum number of these stones increases as the characters level up . 
 = = = Tetra Master = = = 
 Tetra Master is a card @-@ based minigame that can be initiated with various non @-@ playable characters in the field . Players assemble a deck of five cards , which can be obtained via chests , given as a reward , or earned from fighting monsters . Each card has various arrows which point to the four sides and four corners of the card , and various stats that vary between cards , with rarer cards being more powerful . Players take it in turns to strategically place cards on a 4x4 playing grid based on the available directions . Battles can occur when players place a card next to another card , depending on where the player places it . If the defending card has no arrows whilst the attacking card has an arrow pointing towards it , that card is placed under the player 's control . When two arrows meet with each other , the cards do battle based on their point values , with the losing card coming under the winning player 's control , sometimes triggering combos that put multiple cards in the winner 's control . After all cards are played , the winner is the player who has the most cards under their control , with a draw occurring if they have the same number of cards . The winning player may choose a card from their opponent 's deck out of the ones they put under their control . If the winning player scores a perfect win however , in which all ten cards are put under their control , they will win all five cards from the opponent 's deck .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Final Fantasy IX takes place primarily on the four continents of a world named Gaia ( homonymous with Final Fantasy VII 's Gaia , but not the same world ) . Most of Gaia 's population reside on the Mist Continent , named so because the entire continent is blanketed in thick Mist . Lands outside the Mist Continent — the Outer , Lost and Forgotten continents — are uncharted territories not explored until midway through the game . Several locations on the parallel world of Terra and the dream land of Memoria round out the game 's areas . The Mist Continent features four nations : Alexandria , Lindblum , Burmecia , and Cleyra . Alexandria is a kingdom to the northeast of the Mist Continent ruled by a monarchy located in Alexandria Castle . The technologically advanced Lindblum , ruled by a regent , is nestled on a plateau to the southwest where airships regularly fly by . The Kingdom of Burmecia , whose capital is showered by eternal rain is to the northwest and nearby to the isolated <unk> civilisation , which is nestled in a giant tree in the desert , protected by a powerful sandstorm . <unk> , a large , perpetually dark city , heavily populated by both aristocrats and paupers , is located on the southeast part of the continent . The Mist Continent is extremely mountainous resulting in a natural barrier between many of the ruling nations . 
 Gaia is inhabited by humans and various non @-@ human races . Alexandria , <unk> , and Lindblum are populated by a mix of humans and anthropomorphic animals . The <unk> are anthropomorphic rats who value dance , thus accounting for their general aversion to footwear , and live in both Burmecia and Cleyra . The <unk> split from the <unk> when the latter started to appreciate " the art of war " . The dwarves are short humanoid creatures who appear as inhabitants of the village of Conde <unk> on the Outer Continent . There is also a village of black mages that have gained sentient thought , who reside in the Outer Continent , as well . The Genomes , an artificial race of soulless vessels inhabit Terra ; they will house the once @-@ dormant Terran souls when Terra assimilates Gaia . Summoners are similar to other humans , but with a horn on their forehead . In the story , only two summoners remain ( Garnet and Eiko ) ; the others were exterminated when the Terran warship Invincible destroyed their homeland of Madain Sari . Lastly , the Qu are large , seemingly androgynous humanoids , who are recognised as fine <unk> . They inhabit marshlands throughout the world where they catch their main source of nutrition : frogs .

 The eight main playable characters in Final Fantasy IX are Zidane Tribal , a member of a group of bandits called Tantalus masquerading as a theatre troupe ; Garnet Til Alexandros XVII ( alias Dagger ) , the Princess of Alexandria who has a strange connection to " Eidolons " , Vivi <unk> , a young , timid , and kind black mage trying to find the meaning of his existence ; Adelbert Steiner , the Captain of the Knights of Pluto and loyal servant of Alexandria and Princess Garnet ; Freya Crescent , a dragon knight from the city of Burmecia looking for her lost love ; <unk> <unk> , a Qu whose master wants him / her to travel the world so that s / he will learn about cuisine ; Eiko Carol , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl living in Madain Sari , the lost village of the eidolon summoners , and along with Garnet , one of the last two remaining summoners ; and <unk> Coral , a bounty hunter hired to return Garnet to Alexandria . Other main characters include Regent Cid <unk> , the charismatic leader of Lindblum ; Queen Brahne , Garnet 's mother and the power @-@ hungry Queen of Alexandria ; General Beatrix , the powerful leader of the female knights of Alexandria ; and antagonist Kuja , an arms dealer and enemy of Gaia . Other minor characters and groups also appear , such as Blank , Zidane 's good friend and band partner , but their significance and back @-@ stories are revealed as the game progresses . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Final Fantasy IX opens with Zidane and the Tantalus Theater Troupe attempting to kidnap Princess Garnet during her sixteenth birthday celebration in the city of Alexandria . Upon reaching her , they discover that Garnet , who is concerned about Queen Brahne 's increasingly erratic behavior , had planned on escaping the city and is willing to be kidnapped , especially as their employer , Regent Cid of Lindblum , is who she wanted to run to . During the escape from the city , the troupe is joined by Vivi , who is looking to explore , and Steiner , who decides to travel with Garnet for her protection rather than take her back against her will . After the group flees the city and its guards , their damaged airship crashes , and Zidane , Garnet , Vivi , and Steiner travel on together . During their journey to Lindblum , Garnet takes the alias Dagger , and the group discovers a factory in the village of Dali that is manufacturing soulless black mage soldiers that look similar to Vivi . 
 In Lindblum , the party meets with Cid , who explains that he hired the group to kidnap Garnet to get her away from Brahne , who also worries him . Upon learning that Alexandria has invaded the city @-@ state of Burmecia , the party splits in two . Zidane , Vivi , and new <unk> Freya investigate Burmecia , while Dagger and Steiner journey back to Alexandria to try to stop Brahne from starting a war . Zidane 's group finds that Burmecia has been conquered with help from a man named Kuja , and refugees have fled to the nearby city of Cleyra . They rush to Cleyra to defend it from the encroaching forces . Dagger , meanwhile , is ignored and captured by Brahne , who extracts powerful magical weapons called eidolons from her . Brahne proceeds to use one to destroy Cleyra . Zidane and company escaped the city on Brahne 's airship and rescue Garnet , but while they do so Brahne attacks Lindblum with another <unk> . 
 Cid informs the group , when they reach Lindblum , that Kuja is Brahne 's arms dealer . Believing him to be from one of the other continents , normally inaccessible by airship , the party travels through a tunnel with <unk> to the Outer Continent . There they meet Eiko , discover a village of black mages , and find the Iifa Tree , which produces a fighting @-@ stimulant called Mist . They learn that Kuja uses Mist to create the Black Mages , and Vivi was a prototype . After stopping the Mist creation , the group meets <unk> , hired by Brahne to capture Garnet , who joins them instead . They also learn that Garnet is originally from the same destroyed village as Eiko , and has the power to summon eidolons , which was the reason she was adopted by Brahne . Brahne and Kuja then reach the Iifa Tree , but Brahne attempts to kill him with an eidolon ; Kuja instead takes control over it and destroys her and her army instead . 
 The party returns to Alexandria to install Garnet as queen , but are assaulted at her coronation by Kuja . Garnet and Eiko summon an eidolon to combat Kuja 's ; when Kuja tries to take control of their <unk> , he is stopped by an old man named Garland , who then uses Kuja 's ship to destroy Garnet 's eidolon and damage the city . Kuja flees with the intent to fight Garland for power . Seeking to stop both of them , the party gets an experimental airship from Cid that runs on steam rather than Mist , which will allow them to journey to the other continents . Chasing Kuja , they find a portal to the parallel world of Terra ; there they discover that Terra is dying , and its people created Garland to orchestrate merging the two worlds . Garland in turn created Genomes , sentient soulless beings which would be taken over by Terran souls after the merging . The Iifa Tree serves to block <unk> souls from leaving Gaia but letting Terran souls in to be reborn into the Genomes , with the <unk> souls transformed into the Mist . Kuja and Zidane are Genomes , and Kuja turned against Garland to avoid being taken over at the conclusion of the plan . Kuja kills Garland with his newly gained powers , then destroys Terra as the party flees to Gaia with the Genomes . 
 At the Iifa tree , the party defeats Kuja , preventing him from destroying Gaia as well . The fight , so near what they find to be the Crystal , the source of life , summons <unk> , a force of annihilation . Its defeat destroys the Tree ; the party flees , while Zidane stays behind to rescue Kuja . In the epilogue one year later , the fates of all of the characters are shown , and Zidane reappears in Alexandria to see Queen Garnet . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development of Final Fantasy IX began before Square had finished development on Final Fantasy VIII . The game was developed in Hawaii as a compromise to developers living in the United States . As the series ' last game on the PlayStation , Sakaguchi envisioned a " reflection " on the older titles of the series . Leading up to its release , Sakaguchi called Final Fantasy IX his favorite Final Fantasy game as " it 's closest to [ his ] ideal view of what Final Fantasy should be " . This shift was also a response to demands from fans and other developers . Additionally , the team wanted to create an understandable story with deep character development ; this led to the creation of Active Time Events . The scenario for the game was written by Sakaguchi . He began early planning on it around July 1998 . Director Hiroyuki Ito had the idea to make the protagonist Zidane flirtatious towards women . 
 In the game 's conceptual stage , the developers made it clear that the title would not necessarily be Final Fantasy IX , as its break from the realism of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII may have alienated audiences . This led fans to speculate that it would be released as a " gaiden " ( side story ) to the main series . By late 1999 , however , Square had confirmed that the game would indeed be published as Final Fantasy IX , and by early 2000 , the game was nearly finished . The developers made several adjustments to the game , such as changing the ending seven times . Director Ito had designed the battle system used in the game . 
 The game 's developers sought to make the game 's environment more " fantasy @-@ oriented " than its PlayStation predecessors . Since the creators wanted to prevent the series from following a redundant setting , Final Fantasy IX distinctly breaks from the futuristic styles of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by reintroducing a medieval setting . In the game , steam technology is just beginning to become widely available ; the population relies on hydropower or wind power for energy sources , but sometimes harness Mist or steam to power more advanced engines . Continuing with the medieval theme , the game 's setting is inspired by Norse and Northern European mythology . According to Ito , " [ The development team is ] attracted to European history and mythology because of its depth and its drama " . The main Final Fantasy IX website says the development of the game 's world serves as a culmination of the series by blending the " successful elements of the past , such as a return to the fantasy roots , " with newer elements . The creators made the characters a high priority . The return to the series ' roots also affected the characters ' designs , which resulted in characters with " comic @-@ like looks " . Composer Nobuo Uematsu commented that the design staff attempted to give the characters realism while still appearing comic @-@ like . To accomplish this , and to satisfy fans who had become used to the realistic designs of Final Fantasy VIII , the designers stressed creating characters with whom the player could easily relate . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music of Final Fantasy IX was written by series regular Nobuo Uematsu , with the title being his last exclusive Final Fantasy score until the release of Final Fantasy XIV in 2010 . In discussions with game director Hiroyuki Ito , Uematsu was told " It 'd be fine if you compose tracks for the eight characters , an exciting battle track , a gloomy , danger @-@ evoking piece , and around ten other tracks . " However , Uematsu spent an estimated year composing and producing " around 160 " pieces for Final Fantasy IX , with 140 appearing in the game . 
 Uematsu composed with a piano and used two contrasting methods : " I create music that fits the events in the game , but sometimes , the event designer will adjust a game event to fit the music I 've already written . " Uematsu felt Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII had a mood of realism , but Final Fantasy IX was fantasy , so " a serious piece with silly , fun pieces could fit in . " He felt the theme was medieval music , and was given a break to travel in Europe for inspiration — " looking at old castles in Germany and so on " . The music was not entirely composed in the medieval mode ; Uematsu claims " it would be unbalanced " and " a little boring " . He aimed for a " simple , warm " style and included uncommon instruments like the kazoo and dulcimer . Uematsu also included motifs from older Final Fantasy games " because Final Fantasy IX was returning to the roots , so to speak " and incorporated ideas like " the old intro for battle music " and arranged the Volcano theme from Final Fantasy and the Pandemonium theme from Final Fantasy II . Tantalus ' band is also heard playing " Rufus ' Welcoming Ceremony " from Final Fantasy VII near the beginning of the game . 
 Uematsu was twice reported claiming without hesitation that Final Fantasy IX was his favorite score . " Melodies of Life " is the theme song of Final Fantasy IX , and consists primarily of two themes that were frequently used in the game itself , the overworld theme , and a lullaby that is sung by Dagger . It was performed by Emiko Shiratori in both the Japanese and English versions and arranged by Shirō Hamaguchi .

 Final Fantasy IX 's release was delayed to avoid a concurrent release with then rival Enix 's Dragon Quest VII . On October 7 , 2000 , a demo day for the North American version of Final Fantasy IX was held at the Metreon in San Francisco , California . The first American release of the game was also at the Metreon ; limited edition merchandise was included with the game , and fans cosplayed as Final Fantasy characters in celebration of the release . In Canada , a production error left copies of Final Fantasy IX without an English version of the instruction manual , prompting Square to ship copies of the English manual to Canadian stores several days later . 
 The game was heavily promoted both before and after its release . Starting on March 6 , 2000 , Final Fantasy IX characters were used in a line of computer @-@ generated Coca @-@ Cola commercials . Figurines of several characters were also used as prizes in Coca @-@ Cola 's marketing campaign . That same year , IGN awarded Final Fantasy dolls and figurines for prizes in several of their contests . 
 Final Fantasy IX was also the benchmark of Square 's interactive PlayOnline service . PlayOnline was originally developed to interact with Final Fantasy X , but when those plans fell through it became a strategy site for Final Fantasy IX . The site was designed to complement BradyGames ' and <unk> Interactive 's official strategy guides for the game , where players who bought the print guide had access to " keywords " that could be searched for on PlayOnline 's site for extra tips and information . This caused fury among buyers of the guide , as they felt cheated for the expensive print guide . The blunder made GameSpy 's " Top 5 Dumbest Moments in Gaming " list , and Square dropped the idea for Final Fantasy X , which was under development at the time . 
 On December 18 , 2012 , the game was re @-@ released as part of the Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box Japanese package . On February 10 , 2016 , ports for iOS and Android were released . A port for Microsoft Windows was released on April 14 , 2016 .

 Final Fantasy IX sold over 2 @.@ 65 million copies in Japan by the end of 2000 , making it the second @-@ highest selling game of the year there . Although it was a top @-@ seller in Japan and America , Final Fantasy IX did not sell as well as Final Fantasy VII or Final Fantasy VIII in either Japan or the United States . As of March 31 , 2003 , the game had sold 5 @.@ 30 million copies worldwide . The game was voted the 24th @-@ best game of all time by readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Final Fantasy IX was released to critical acclaim both in Japan and the US . On the review aggregator Metacritic it has achieved a score of 94 % , the highest score for a Final Fantasy game on the site . On GameRankings it has received a score of 93 % , the second highest of any Final Fantasy title , behind Final Fantasy VI for the Super NES . 
 Across the reviews , praise was given to the graphics and nostalgic elements . Critics pointed out the strength of the game within its gameplay , character development , and visual representation . GameSpot noted that the learning curve is easily grasped , and that the ability system is not as complex as in Final Fantasy VII or Final Fantasy VIII . Each player character possesses unique abilities , which hinders the development of an over @-@ powered character . GameSpot describes the battle system as having a tactical nature and notes that the expanded party allows for more interaction between players and between enemies . Nevertheless , IGN disliked the lengthy combat pace and the repeated battles , describing it as " aggravating " , and RPGFan felt the Trance system to be ineffective as the meter buildup is slow and unpredictable , with characters <unk> just before the enemy is killed . 
 The characters and graphics received positive reviews . Although IGN felt that the in @-@ depth character traits in Final Fantasy IX could be generally found in other Final Fantasy games , it still found the characters to be engaging and sympathetic . GameSpot found the characters , up to their dialogue and traits , amusing and full of humor . IGN also noted that the Active Time Event system helps to expand the player 's understanding of the characters ' personalities as they question many ideas and emotions . Their semi @-@ deformed appearance , which also covers monsters of every size , contain detailed animation and design . They gave praise to the pre @-@ rendered backgrounds , noting the careful attention given to the artwork , movement in animations and character interactivity . The movies are seen as emotive and compelling , and the seamless transition and incorporation to the in @-@ game graphics helped to move the plot well . 
 Critics acknowledged that the overall storyline was mainly built upon elements found in previous Final Fantasy installments , such as evil empires and enigmatic villains . The main villain , although considered by GameSpot to be the least threatening in the series , was seen by IGN as an impeccable combination of " Kefka 's cackling villainy " and " plenty of the <unk> that made Sephiroth such a hit with the ladies " . Mixed reactions were given to the audio aspects of the game . Some reviewers , such as RPGFan felt that the music was " uninspired and dull " whilst GamePro praised the audio for evoking " emotions throughout the story , from battles to heartbreak to comedy " . Some criticism was leveled on composer Nobuo Uematsu who reused some tracks from past iterations of the series . Still , reviewers have come to agree that this and many other elements are part of the overall effort to create a nostalgic title for fans of the older Final Fantasy titles . 
 The strategy guide also received criticism ; it urged buyers to log onto an online site to gain the information , instead of providing it within the actual guide . The book 's given links are no longer accessible on the PlayOnline website . Tetra Master was seen by GameSpot as inferior and confusing compared to Final Fantasy VIII 's minigame Triple Triad , as the rules for it were only vaguely explained in the game and there were very few rewards earned from playing it despite its expansive nature .

 = Boogie Chillen ' = 
 " Boogie Chillen ' " or " Boogie Chillun " is a blues song first recorded by John Lee Hooker in 1948 . It is a solo performance featuring Hooker 's vocal , electric guitar , and rhythmic foot stomps . The lyrics are partly autobiographical and alternate between spoken and sung verses . The song was his debut record release and in 1949 , it became the first " down @-@ home " electric blues song to reach number one in the R & B records chart . 
 Hooker 's song was part of a trend in the late 1940s to a new style of urban electric blues based on earlier Delta blues idioms . Although it is called a boogie , it resembles early North Mississippi Hill country blues rather than the boogie @-@ woogie piano @-@ derived style of the 1930s and 1940s . Hooker gave credit to his stepfather , Will Moore , who taught him the rhythm of " Boogie Chillen ' " ( " <unk> ' " is a <unk> approximation of Hooker 's pronunciation of " children " ) when he was a teenager . Some of the song 's lyrics are derived from earlier blues songs . 
 Hooker 's guitar work on the song inspired several well @-@ known guitarists to take up the instrument . With its driving style and focus on rhythm , it is also considered a forerunner of rock and roll . Music critic Cub Koda calls the guitar figure from " Boogie Chillen ' " " the riff that launched a million songs " . Several rock musicians have patterned successful songs either directly or indirectly on Hooker 's many versions of " Boogie Chillen ' " . These include songs by boogie rock band Canned Heat , who also recorded a well @-@ received version with Hooker . One of ZZ Top 's best @-@ known hits , " La Grange " , uses elements of the song , which led to legal action by the song 's publisher and resulted in changes to American copyright law .

 In 1943 , Hooker moved to Detroit , Michigan , for employment opportunities in the city 's wartime vehicle manufacturing factories . There he was attracted to the music clubs along Hastings Street in Black Bottom / Paradise Valley , the cultural center of the city 's black community .

 By 1948 , Hooker came to the attention of Elmer Barbee , a local record shop owner . Barbee arranged to have several demos recorded . He or Hooker later presented them to Bernie Besman , who ran the Detroit area 's only professional record company . Although Hooker had played mostly with an ensemble at that time , Besman decided to record him solo . This put the attention solely on the singer / guitarist , in contrast to the prevailing jump blues style , which emphasized ensemble instrumentation . Recent hit singles by Muddy Waters and Lightnin ' Hopkins had also used this stripped @-@ down , electrified Delta blues @-@ inspired approach . 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " Boogie Chillen ' " is described by music critic Bill Dahl as " blues as primitive as anything then on the market ; Hooker 's dark , ruminative vocals were backed only by his own ringing , heavily amplified guitar and insistently pounding foot " . In an interview , Hooker how he came up with " Boogie Chillen ' " : 
 I wrote that song in Detroit when I was sittin ' around <unk> ' my guitar . The thing come into me , you know ? I heard [ my stepfather ] Will Moore done [ sic ] it years and years before . I was a little kid from down South , and I heard him do a song like that , but he didn 't call it ' Boogie Chillen . ' But it had that beat , and I just kept that beat up and I called it ' Boogie <unk> 
 He performed the song in clubs before recording it and called it " Boogie Woogie " before settling on " Boogie Chillen ' " . According to musicologist Robert Palmer , " The closest thing to it on records is ' <unk> Blues ' , recorded by Garfield Akers and Joe Callicott , two guitarists from the hill country of northern Mississippi , in 1929 . Essentially , it was a backcountry , pre @-@ blues sort of music — a droning , open @-@ ended stomp without a fixed verse form that lent itself to building up to a cumulative , <unk> effect " . 
 Hooker 's vocal alternates between sung and spoken sections . Commenting on Hooker 's vocal sections , music historian Ted Gioia notes , " The song has almost no melody . Even less harmony . In fact , it is hard to call it a song . It 's more like a bit of jive steam of consciousness in 4 / 4 time . " Some of the lyrics are borrowed from earlier songs that date back to the beginning of the blues . The opening line " My mama she didn 't allow me to stay out all night long " has origins in " Mama Don 't Allow " , an old dance song . Several songs were recorded in the 1920s with similar titles . " Boogie No. 3 " by boogie @-@ woogie pianist Cow Cow Davenport has sung and spoken sections and includes the lines , " I don 't care what Grandma don 't allow , play my music anyhow , Grandma 's don 't ' <unk> no music <unk> ' in here " . Hooker 's first and second takes of the song include similar verses and the narrative about Henry 's Swing Club , but do not include the crucial mid @-@ song hook " Boogie , <unk> ' ! " before the guitar break , which gives the song its lyrical identity . 
 A key feature of the song is the driving guitar rhythmic figure centered on one chord , with " accents that fell fractionally ahead of the beat " . Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray describes it as a " rocking dance piece ... its structure is utterly free @-@ form , its basic beat is the jumping , polyrhythmic groove which he [ Hooker ] learned in the Delta " . In an interview with B.B. King , Hooker confirmed that he used an open G guitar tuning technique for his guitar , although he usually used a capo , raising the pitch to B ( 1948 ) , A ♭ ( 1959 ) , or A ( 1970 ) . He also employed hammer @-@ on and pull @-@ off techniques , which are described as " a slurred ascending bass line played on the fifth string [ tonic ] " by music writer Lenny Carlson . Although it is titled a " boogie " , it does not resemble the earlier boogie @-@ woogie style . Boogie @-@ woogie is based on a left @-@ hand piano ostinato or walking @-@ bass line and , as performed on guitar , forms the popular 1940s instrumental " Guitar Boogie " . Rather than being derivative , Hooker 's boogie becomes " as overwhelmingly personal a piece as anything ever done in the blues " . 
 = = Recording and release = = 
 In September 1948 , Besman arranged recording sessions for Hooker at United Sound studios in Detroit . Several songs were recorded with Hooker 's vocals and amplified guitar . To make the sound fuller , a microphone was set up in a pallet that was placed under Hooker 's foot . According to Besman 's account , a primitive echo @-@ chamber effect was created by feeding Hooker 's foot @-@ stomp rhythm into a speaker in a toilet bowl , which in turn was miked and returned to a speaker in the studio in front of Hooker 's guitar , thus giving it a " big " or more ambient sound . Three takes of Hooker 's performance were recorded , the last providing the master for " Boogie Chillen ' " . 
 Even though Besman had his own record label , Sensation Records , he licensed " Boogie Chillen ' " to Los Angeles @-@ based Modern Records . On November 3 , 1948 , it was released nationally and Hooker commented on its immediate appeal : " The thing caught afire . It was <unk> ' all around the country . When it come out , every juke box you went to , every place you went to ... they were playing it there " . Because of the response , Nashville , Tennessee , radio station <unk> , a 50 @,@ 000 watt clear @-@ channel station that reached fifteen states and Canada , played the song ten times in a row during one broadcast night . It entered the Billboard Race Records chart on January 8 , 1949 , where it remained for eighteen weeks , and reached number one on February 19 , 1949 . It became the most popular race record of 1949 and reportedly sold " several hundred thousand " to one million copies . In an experience similar to Muddy Waters ' 1950 hit " Rollin ' Stone " , the song 's popularity allowed Hooker to give up his factory job and concentrate on music . 
 = = Early influence = = 
 Besides its commercial success , " Boogie Chillen ' " had a big impact on blues and R & B musicians . B.B. King , who was a disc jockey at Memphis , Tennessee , radio station <unk> at the time , regularly featured Hooker 's song . He recalled : 
 [ There was ] hardly anybody around who was playing at that time didn 't play ' Boogie Chillen . ' That 's just how heavy it was ... I , for one , and many others [ musicians ] who would go out and play — if you didn 't play ' Boogie Chillen ' at that time , people probably look at you and wonder what was wrong with you . It was such a big record . 
 Murray likens the song to " the R & B equivalent of punk rock " or superficially simple enough not to intimidate beginners . It interested the eleven @-@ year @-@ old Bo Diddley : " I think the first record I paid attention to was John Lee Hooker 's ' Boogie Chillen , ' ... When I found John Lee Hooker on the radio , I said , ' If that guy can play , I know I can . ' I mean John Lee 's got a hell of a style " . In an interview , Buddy Guy described learning to play " Boogie Chillen ' " at age thirteen : " that was the first thing I thought I learned how to play that I knew sounded right when someone would listen . " Guy later recorded a version with Junior Wells for their 1981 album Alone & Acoustic . Albert Collins also recalled that it was the first song he learned to play . 
 The success of " Boogie Chillen ' " brought numerous offers for John Lee Hooker to record for other record companies . Because he received little remuneration from the sales of his record , Hooker readily accepted the opportunities to generate income . This led to his recording using a variety of pseudonyms , including Texas Slim , Little Pork Chops , Delta John , Birmingham Sam , the Boogie Man , Johnny Williams , John Lee Booker , John Lee <unk> , and others for such labels as King , <unk> , Regent , Savoy , Acorn , Prize , Staff , Gotham , Gone , Chess , and Swing Time . 
 = = Later Hooker versions = = 
 The demand for " Boogie Chillen ' " remained high enough for Hooker to re @-@ record the song several times . In 1950 , he recorded a faster version with different lyrics as " Boogie Chillen ' # 2 " for Bernie Besman 's Sensation label ( also issued by Regal ) . Modern Records released an edited version in 1952 titled " New Boogie Chillun " . After Hooker began his association with Vee @-@ Jay Records , he recorded " Boogie Chillun " in 1959 , which closely follows the original single . Because of the similarity , the 1959 version is sometimes misidentified as the 1948 version and vice versa ( at 2 : 36 , the Vee @-@ Jay version is about a half a minute shorter than the original ) . 
 The first two takes from the September 1948 Detroit recording session began appearing on various compilation albums in the 1970s , sometimes with the titles " John Lee 's Original Boogie " and " Henry 's Swing Club " . Meanwhile , Modern and its associated labels including Kent and Crown reissued the song several times . 
 From the 1960s onwards , Hooker recorded several studio and live renditions of " Boogie Chillen ' " , with guest musicians such as Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones . In 1970 , he recorded an updated version of the song , titled " Boogie Chillen ' No. 2 " , with the blues rock group Canned Heat for their joint album , Hooker ' n Heat . Blues historian Gerard Herzhaft describes the performance as a " memorable one " . It combines Hooker 's vocal and Canned Heat 's signature boogie rock backing , as heard in the group 's jam song " Fried Hockey Boogie " ( itself an adaptation of " Boogie Chillen ' " ) . Despite being over eleven minutes long with extended guitar and harmonica solos , it remains as " full of the same swagger as the original " . 
 = = Recognition and legacy = = 
 In 1985 , Hooker 's 1948 recording of " Boogie Chillen ' " was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame . Writing for the Foundation , blues historian Jim O 'Neal noted it was " the first down @-@ home electric blues record to achieve No. 1 chart status and its success , together with that of the Hooker hits that followed , inspired record companies to search out the new electric generation of country bluesmen " . In 1999 , it received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the " 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll " . " Boogie Chillen ' " was added to the U.S. National Recording Registry in 2008 , which noted that " the driving rhythm and confessional lyrics have guaranteed its place as an influential and enduring blues classic " . Authors Jim Dawson and Steve <unk> included it in their 1992 book What Was the First Rock ' n ' Roll Record ? , identifying it among the precursors of rock and roll . 
 " Boogie Chillen ' " has inspired several songs , beginning in 1953 , when Junior Parker recorded his interpretation titled " Feelin ' Good " . It became Parker 's first hit for Sun Records and was subsequently recorded by James Cotton in 1967 and by Magic Sam as " I Feel So Good ( I Wanna Boogie ) " for his influential 1967 album West Side Soul . A version by Slim Harpo , titled " Boogie Chillun " , appeared on his 1970 album Slim Harpo Knew the Blues using a similar arrangement to his 1966 hit " Shake Your Hips " . 
 Other songs that borrow from " Boogie Chillen ' " or " Boogie Chillen ' No. 2 " , either directly or indirectly , include the radio hits " On the Road Again " by Canned Heat in 1968 , " Spirit in the Sky " by Norman Greenbaum in 1970 , and " La Grange " by ZZ Top in 1973 . 
 = = Copyright issues = = 
 In 1991 , Bernie Besman , as the song 's publisher , La <unk> Music , brought legal action against ZZ Top for copyright infringement for their song " La Grange " . Writer Timothy English notes that of the various Hooker recordings of " Boogie Chillen ' " , the one released in 1971 with Canned Heat " has the most elements in common with ' La Grange ' , including the guitar pattern and the ' howl , howl , howl ' vocal line " . The case wound its way through the American legal system ( including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court ) . When the ruling did not favor the publisher , the U.S. Congress was persuaded to amend the Copyright Act in 1998 to protect many songs recorded before 1978 from entering the public domain . ZZ Top settled out of court in 1997 , but Hooker again gained no financial reward from his song — Besman had obtained Hooker 's rights to the song years earlier . However , Gioia noted , " Nonetheless , his [ John Lee Hooker 's 1948 ] spontaneous performance in a recording studio had led to a substantial change in U.S. intellectual property law " . 
 = California State Route 275 = 
 State Route 275 ( SR 275 ) is a short unsigned state highway in the Sacramento area of the U.S. state of California . The highway is currently defined to be the length of the Tower Bridge between West Sacramento and downtown Sacramento . 
 Prior to 1996 , SR 275 was also known as the West Sacramento Freeway , and was a short spur from Interstate 80 Business / U.S. Route 50 in West Sacramento over the Tower Bridge into downtown Sacramento . West Sacramento completed a project to replace the freeway with a pedestrian @-@ friendly street named Tower Bridge Gateway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The West Sacramento Freeway begins on Interstate 80 at exit 81 ( West Capitol Avenue ) , the east end of the Yolo Causeway . It soon splits , with I @-@ 80 exiting to bypass Sacramento to the north and Interstate 80 Business ( legislatively U.S. Route 50 ) continuing east via exit 82 towards downtown . After one interchange , at Harbor Boulevard ( exit 1 / 1B ) , the freeway splits again , with Bus . 80 turning abruptly southeast over the Pioneer Memorial Bridge to avoid downtown Sacramento . State Route 275 begins here , at exit 3 of Bus . 80 , with full access to and from the intersecting Jefferson Boulevard ( State Route 84 ) . 
 State maintenance ends just after the Jefferson Boulevard interchange , and the road — now maintained by the city of West Sacramento as Tower Bridge Gateway — crosses the new Garden Street at an at @-@ grade intersection . This intersection replaced a partial trumpet interchange , oriented towards West Capitol Avenue with a missing westbound entrance , in 2007 . After Tower Bridge Gateway crosses under the Union Pacific Railroad line that used to cross the Tower Bridge , it approaches an intersection with 5th Street . It was formerly a ramp that entered the westbound lanes from the intersection of West Capitol Avenue and 5th Street , which completed the former interchange at Riske Lane . Two blocks to the east , Tower Bridge Gateway approaches its final intersection in West Sacramento with 3rd Street . A westbound offramp formerly lead to West Capitol Avenue and 3rd Street , with eastbound access to Broderick to the north and the formerly industrial area to the south , now containing Raley Field . 
 State maintenance resumes once again as SR 275 crosses the Sacramento River on the Tower Bridge , a four @-@ lane lift bridge that formerly carried a Sacramento Northern Railroad track in the center . At the east end of the bridge , the roadway becomes Capitol Mall , maintained by the city of Sacramento , and crosses over Interstate 5 . Seven blocks later , the main road ends at 9th Street ; the last block of Capitol Mall to 10th Street , on which the State Capitol fronts , is a two @-@ lane road with a mid @-@ block traffic circle around a fountain . 
 = = History = = 
 SR 275 began as part of Legislative Route 6 , one of the shorter main routes of the initial system funded by the 1910 bond issue . This highway , which included the several @-@ mile @-@ long Yolo Causeway , connected Sacramento with the north – south Route 7 at Davis , thereby linking the capital city with the San Francisco Bay Area . Route 6 traffic initially left Sacramento on the 1911 I Street Bridge , heading southwest through the small settlement of Washington via D Street , 5th Street , and present Tower Court to West Capitol Avenue . The state highway was moved to the M Street Bridge in 1926 , as part of an improvement that also took it through a two @-@ lane subway under the Sacramento Northern Railroad , still present on West Capitol Avenue . The M Street Bridge was replaced by the Tower Bridge in 1935 . 
 U.S. Routes 40 and 99 ( soon 99W ) were marked along Route 6 in 1928 . These two routes remained on West Capitol Avenue until 1954 , when the new West Sacramento Freeway opened , connecting the west end of the Tower Bridge with the east end of the Yolo Causeway . Traveler @-@ oriented businesses along the bypassed West Capitol Avenue were hit hard by the shifting of through traffic . 
 The entire freeway was designated as part of Interstate 80 in the late 1950s . However , two bypasses were planned — a realignment of Route 6 that would take I @-@ 80 over a new bridge and around the south side of downtown , and a northern bypass of the entire city ( I @-@ 880 ) . Since the southerly bypass had not been completed in time for the 1964 renumbering , the route over the Tower Bridge — and along downtown streets — became Route 80 , but US 99W signage remained ( initially following Capitol Mall to near the State Capitol , later turning south onto 3rd and 5th Streets east of the bridge ) until the late 1960s , before I @-@ 5 had finished replacing old US 99W north of Woodland . 
 Normally , upon completion of the new I @-@ 80 south of downtown , the old alignment over the Tower Bridge and through downtown would be relinquished . The legislature recognized that it might be useful to keep a state highway to the Capitol , and so in 1966 it passed a concurrent resolution requesting that the California Highway Commission delay relinquishment west of 9th Street until the last day of the 1967 legislative session . During that session , a new Route 275 was created from that portion of former Route 80 . This consisted of the eastern part of the West Sacramento Freeway , the Tower Bridge , and Capitol Mall up to 9th Street , just west of the capitol building . The portion in Sacramento , east of the bridge , was not to be beautified with state highway funds . Due to the cancellation of a replacement of the North Sacramento Freeway , I @-@ 80 was moved to former I @-@ 880 around the city in 1981 , giving the West Sacramento Freeway three numbers : I @-@ 80 , US 50 , and SR 275 . 
 In 1993 , the West Sacramento City Council approved the " Triangle Specific Plan " for a new downtown in the triangle bounded by the Sacramento River , SR 275 , and US 50 ; this plan included downgrading the freeway to a surface road . The state legislature passed a law in 1994 that allowed Caltrans to come to an agreement with West Sacramento or Sacramento for the relinquishment of any part of SR 275 . Although no portions had yet been relinquished , the legislature deleted Route 275 from the Streets and Highways Code in 1996 . 
 The Triangle redevelopment happened slowly , with the first part — Raley Field — opening in 2000 . Effective January 1 , 2001 , Caltrans relinquished SR 275 to West Sacramento between postmiles 12 @.@ 4 ( west of Riske Lane ) and 13 @.@ 0 ( the west end of the Tower Bridge ) . The city renamed the road Tower Bridge Gateway and demolished the Riske Lane overpass in early 2007 , replacing it with a signalized intersection that now serves the new Garden Street . 
 The city of Sacramento also wished to modify its section of SR 275 , which , while not a freeway , was still designed for motor vehicle traffic . Capitol Mall east of postmile 0 @.@ 11 ( the east end of the Tower Bridge ) was relinquished to the city effective January 1 , 2006 . A ramp from the bridge to N Street was closed in July 2007 , allowing the block it had cut diagonally through to be sold . The ramp 's counterpart , from L Street to the Tower Bridge , remains open , though the lot that includes it was sold to the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency in 2005 . 
 These 2001 and 2007 <unk> left Caltrans maintaining only two pieces of SR 275 — the Tower Bridge and the west end through the Jefferson Boulevard ( SR 84 ) interchange — for a total of about 0 @.@ 9 miles ( 1 @.@ 4 km ) , under half of the 1967 @-@ 2001 length . A joint project to widen the bridge sidewalks was carried out by Sacramento , West Sacramento , and Caltrans . The project was completed in May 2008 . 
 A second phase to convert the remaining section of freeway of Tower Bridge Gateway to a city street began in 2010 . The 3rd Street underpass and subsequent interchange was removed and signalized intersections at 5th and 3rd streets were created . The project was completed in November 2011 . 
 The legislature added Route 275 back to the Streets and Highways Code in 2010 , but its definition now only includes " Tower Bridge from the west side of the Sacramento River near the City of West Sacramento to the east side of the Sacramento River near the City of Sacramento . " 
 As of 2016 , only two interchanges of the former SR 275 remain : a diamond interchange at Jefferson Boulevard ( SR 84 ) and the split at Business Loop 80 / US 50 .

 = Utica , New York = 
 Utica ( pronounced / <unk> / ) is a city in the Mohawk Valley and the county seat of Oneida County , New York , United States . The tenth @-@ most @-@ populous city in New York , its population was 62 @,@ 235 in the 2010 U.S. census . Located on the Mohawk River at the foot of the Adirondack Mountains , Utica is approximately 90 miles ( 145 km ) northwest of Albany and 45 miles ( 72 km ) east of Syracuse . Although Utica and the neighboring city of Rome have their own metropolitan area , both cities are also represented and influenced by the commercial , educational and cultural characteristics of the Capital District and Syracuse metropolitan areas . 
 Formerly a river settlement inhabited by the Mohawk tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy , Utica attracted European @-@ American settlers from New England during and after the American Revolution . In the 19th century , immigrants strengthened its position as a layover city between Albany and Syracuse on the Erie and Chenango Canals and the New York Central Railroad . During the 19th and 20th centuries , the city 's infrastructure contributed to its success as a manufacturing center and defined its role as a worldwide hub for the textile industry . Utica 's 20th @-@ century political corruption and organized crime gave it the nicknames " Sin City " , and later , " the city that God forgot . " 
 Like other Rust Belt cities , Utica had an economic downturn beginning in the mid @-@ 20th century . The downturn consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills , population loss caused by the relocation of jobs and businesses to suburbs and to Syracuse , and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a decreased tax base . With its low cost of living , the city has become a melting pot for refugees from war @-@ torn countries around the world , encouraging growth for its colleges and universities , cultural institutions and economy . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Several theories exist about the history of the name " Utica " . Although surveyor Robert Harpur stated that he named the village , the most accepted theory involves a 1798 meeting at Bagg 's Tavern ( a resting place for travelers passing through the village ) where the name was picked from a hat holding 13 suggestions , Utica being included because it is the name of a city of antiquity ( several other upstate New York cities had adopted classical Mediterranean city names earlier , such as Troy , New York ( 1789 ) and Rome , New York ( 1796 ) , or were to later , as with Syracuse , New York ( 1847 ) ) .

 = = = Iroquois natives and European settlement = = = 
 Utica was established on the site of Old Fort Schuyler , built by English colonists for defense in 1758 during the French and Indian War , the North American front of the Seven Years ' War against France . Prior to construction of the fort , the Mohawk , Onondaga and Oneida tribes had occupied this area south of the Great Lakes region as early as 4000 BC . The Mohawk were the largest and most powerful tribe in the eastern part of the Mohawk Valley . Colonists had a longstanding fur trade with them , in exchange for firearms and rum . The tribe 's dominating presence in the region prevented the Province of New York from expanding past the middle of the Mohawk Valley until after the American Revolutionary War , when the Iroquois were forced to cede their lands as allies of the defeated British . 
 The land housing Old Fort Schuyler was part of a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 80 @.@ 94 km ² ) portion of marshland granted by King George II to New York governor William Cosby on January 2 , 1734 . Since the fort was located near several trails ( including the Great Indian Warpath ) , its position — on a bend at a shallow portion of the Mohawk River — made it an important fording point . The Mohawk called the bend <unk> ( " around the hill " ) , and the Mohawk word appears on the city 's seal . 
 During the American Revolution , border raids from British @-@ allied Iroquois tribes harried the settlers on the frontier . George Washington ordered Sullivan 's Expedition , Rangers , to enter Central New York and suppress the Iroquois threat . More than 40 Iroquois villages were destroyed and their winter stores , causing starvation . In the aftermath of the war , numerous European @-@ American settlers migrated into the state and this western region from New England , especially Connecticut . 
 In 1794 a state road , Genesee Road , was built from Utica west to the Genesee River . That year a contract was awarded to the Mohawk Turnpike and Bridge Company to extend the road northeast to Albany , and in 1798 it was extended . The Seneca Turnpike was key to Utica 's development , replacing a worn footpath with a paved road . The village became a rest and supply area along the Mohawk River for goods and the many people moving through Western New York to and from the Great Lakes . 
 The boundaries of the village of Utica were defined in an act passed by the New York State Legislature on April 3 , 1798 . Utica expanded its borders in subsequent 1805 and 1817 charters . On April 5 , 1805 , the village 's eastern and western boundaries were expanded , and on April 7 , 1817 , Utica separated from <unk> on its west . After completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 , the city 's growth was stimulated again . 
 The municipal charter was passed by the state legislature on February 13 , 1832 . The city 's growth during the 19th century is indicated by the increase in its population ; in 1845 the United States Census ranked Utica as the 29th @-@ largest in the country ( with 20 @,@ 000 residents ) , more than the populations of Chicago , Detroit and Cleveland , respectively . In the latter part of the century , Chicago became a boomtown based on resource extraction and processing from the Midwest , and as a railroad center . 
 = = = Industry , trade , and slavery = = = 
 Utica 's location on the Erie and Chenango canals encouraged industrial development , allowing the transport of anthracite from northeastern Pennsylvania for local manufacturing and distribution . Utica 's economy centered around the manufacture of furniture , heavy machinery , textiles and lumber . The combined effects of the Embargo Act of 1807 and local investment enabled further expansion of the textile industry . Like other upstate New York cities , mills in Utica processed cotton from the Deep South , a slave society . Much of the New York economy was closely involved with slavery ; in the antebellum period , half of New York 's exports were related to cotton . 
 In addition to the canals , transport in Utica was bolstered by railroads running through the city . The first was the Mohawk and Hudson Rail Road , which became the Utica and Schenectady Railroad in 1833 . Its 78 @-@ mile ( 126 km ) connection between Schenectady and Utica was developed in 1836 from the right @-@ of @-@ way previously used by the Mohawk and Hudson River railway . Later lines , such as the Syracuse and Utica Railroad , merged with the Utica and Schenectady to form the New York Central Railroad , which originated as a 20th @-@ century forest railway in the Adirondacks . 
 During the 1850s , Utica was known to aid more than 650 fugitive slaves ; it played a major role as a station in the Underground Railroad . The city was on a slave escape route from the Southern Tier to Canada by way of Albany , Syracuse and Rochester . The route , used by Harriet Tubman to travel to Buffalo , guided slaves to pass through Utica on the New York Central Railroad right @-@ of @-@ way en route to Canada . Utica was the locus for Methodist preacher Orange Scott 's antislavery sermons during the 1830s and 1840s , and Scott formed an abolitionist group there in 1843 . Despite efforts by local abolitionists , pro @-@ slavery riots and mobs , who wanted to protect the cotton mills , forced many abolitionist meetings to other cities . 
 = = = 20th century to present = = = 
 The early 20th century brought rail advances to Utica , with the New York Central electrifying 49 miles ( 79 km ) of track from the city to Syracuse in 1907 for its West Shore interurban line . In 1902 , the Utica and Mohawk Valley Railway connected Rome to Little Falls with a 37 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 60 @.@ 4 km ) electrified line through Utica . 
 By the 1950s , Utica was known as " Sin City " because of the extent of its corruption at the hands of the Democratic Party political machine . During the late 1920s , trucker Rufus Elefante rose to power although he never ran for office . Originally a Republican , Elefante 's power was enhanced by support from New York governor Franklin D. Roosevelt . Waves of Italian , Polish and Lebanese Maronite immigrants worked in the city 's industries in the early part of the 20th century . Until the 1980s , organized crime had a strong role in the city . 
 Strongly affected by the deindustrialization that took place in other Rust Belt cities , Utica suffered a major reduction in manufacturing activity during the second half of the 20th century . The 1954 opening of the New York State Thruway ( which bypassed the city ) and declines in activity on the Erie Canal and railroads throughout the United States also contributed to a poor local economy . During the 1980s and 1990s , major employers such as General Electric and Lockheed Martin began to close plants in Utica and Syracuse . 
 With city jobs moved to the towns and villages around Utica during the suburbanization of the postwar period . This led to the expansion of the nearby Town of New Hartford and the village of <unk> . Utica 's lack of quality academic and educational choices , when compared to Syracuse under an hour away , contributed to its decline in local businesses and jobs as some economic activity moved to Syracuse during the 1990s . Utica 's population fell while population in the county increased , reflecting a statewide trend of decreasing urban populations outside New York City . Residents who remain in the city struggle to handle poverty issues stemming from social and economic conditions caused partially by a smaller tax base ; this adversely affects schools and public services . 
 Despite the city 's economic decline , it has benefited from a low cost of living , attracting immigrants and refugees from around the world . Among the new waves of immigrants are Muslim Bosnians and Buddhist Vietnamese . Further bolstering the city are its commercial , educational and cultural ties to the Capital District and Syracuse metropolitan areas . 
 In 2010 , Utica , the focus of local , regional and statewide economic @-@ revitalization efforts , developed its first comprehensive master plan in more than a half @-@ century .

 The city 's Mohawk name , <unk> ( " around the hill " ) refers to a bend in the Mohawk River that flows around the city 's elevated position as seen from the Deerfield Hills in the north . The Erie Canal and Mohawk River pass through northern Utica ; northwest of downtown is the Utica Marsh , a group of cattail wetlands between the Erie Canal and Mohawk River ( partially in the town of Marcy ) with a variety of animals , plants and birds . During the 1850s , plank roads were built through the marshland surrounding the city . Utica 's suburbs have more hills and cliffs than the city . Located where the Mohawk Valley forms a wide floodplain , the city has a generally sloping , flat topography . 
 = = = Cityscape = = = 
 Utica 's architecture features many styles that are also visible in comparable areas of Buffalo , Rochester and Syracuse , including Greek Revival , Italianate , French Renaissance , Gothic Revival and Neoclassical . The modernist 1972 Utica State Office Building , at 17 floors and 227 feet ( 69 m ) , is the city 's tallest . 
 Early settlers and property owners contributed to the development of the city , and many families and individuals are remembered in street names . Streets laid out when Utica was a village had more irregularities than those built later in the 19th and 20th centuries . As a result of the city 's location ( adjacent to the Mohawk River ) , many streets parallel the river , so they do not run strictly east @-@ west or north – south . Remnants of Utica 's early electric @-@ rail systems can be seen in the West and South neighborhoods , where the rails were set into the streets . 
 = = = Neighborhoods = = = 
 Utica 's neighborhoods have historically been defined by their residents , allowing them to develop their own individuality . Racial and ethnic groups , social and economic separation and the development of infrastructure and new means of transportation have shaped neighborhoods , with groups shifting between them as a result . 
 West Utica ( or the West Side ) was historically home to German , Irish and Polish immigrants . The Corn Hill neighborhood in the city center had a significant Jewish population . East Utica ( or the East Side ) is a cultural and political center dominated by Italian immigrants . North of downtown is the Triangle neighborhood , home to the city 's African American and Jewish populations . Neighborhoods formerly dominated by one or more groups saw other groups arrive , such as Bosnians and Latin Americans in former Italian neighborhoods and the Welsh in Corn Hill . Bagg Commemorative Park and Bagg 's Square West ( Utica 's historic centers ) are in the northeastern portion of downtown , with Genesee Street on the west and Oriskany Street on the south .

 Winters are cold and snowy ; Utica receives lake @-@ effect snow from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario . Utica is colder on average than other Great Lakes cities because of its location in a valley and susceptibility to north winds ; temperatures in the single digits or below zero Fahrenheit are not uncommon on winter nights . Annual precipitation ( based on a 30 @-@ year average from 1981 – 2010 ) is 42 @.@ 1 inches ( 107 cm ) , falling on an average of 171 days .

 Although Utica 's population is predominantly European American , it has diversified since the 1990s . New immigrants and refugees have included Bosnians , displaced by the Bosnian War ) , Russians , Burmese , Vietnamese , and Latinos . More than 15 languages are spoken in the city . Utica has a low cost of living but its industrial and economic decline have posed difficulties for people trying to make a new start . 
 The city is the tenth most populous in New York , the seat of Oneida County , and ( with Schenectady ) a focal point of the six @-@ county Mohawk Valley region . According to a U.S. Census estimate , the Utica – Rome Metropolitan Statistical Area decreased in population from 299 @,@ 397 in 2010 to 296 @,@ 615 on July 1 , 2014 and its population density was about 3 @,@ 818 people per square mile ( 1 @,@ 474 / km ² ) .

 = = Economy = = 
 During the mid @-@ 19th century , Utica 's canals and railroads supported industries producing furniture , locomotive headlights , steam gauges , firearms , textiles and lumber . World War I sparked the growth of Savage Arms , which produced the Lewis gun for the British Army , and the city prospered as one of the wealthiest per capita in the United States . 
 In the early 20th century , the local textile industry began to decline , which had a significant impact on the local economy . The <unk> weevil adversely affected southern cotton crops in this period . During the late 1940s , air @-@ conditioned mills opened in the southern United States , and jobs were lost as factories were moved south , where labor costs were lower because " right to work " laws weakened unions . Other industries also moved out of the city during a general restructuring in older industrial cities . New industries to rise in the city were electronics manufacturing ( led by companies such as General Electric , which produced transistor radios ) , machinery and equipment , and food processing . 
 The city struggled to make a transition to new industries . During the second half of the 20th century , the city 's recessions were longer than the national average . The exodus of defense companies ( such as Lockheed Martin , formed from the merger of the Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta in 1995 ) and the electrical @-@ manufacturing industry played a major role in Utica 's recent economic distress . From 1975 to 2001 , the city 's economic growth rate was similar to that of Buffalo , while other upstate New York cities such as Rochester and Binghamton outperformed both . 
 In the early 21st century , the Mohawk Valley economy is based on logistics , industrial processes , machinery , and industrial services . In Rome , the former Griffiss Air Force Base has remained a regional employer as a technology center . The Turning Stone Resort & Casino in Verona is a tourist destination , with a number of expansions during the 1990s and 2000s . 
 Utica 's larger employers include the <unk> Corporation ( a surgical @-@ device and orthotics manufacturer ) and Faxton St. Luke 's Healthcare , the city 's primary health care system . 
 Construction , such as the North @-@ South Arterial Highway project , supports the public @-@ sector job market . Although passenger and commercial traffic on the Erie Canal has declined greatly since the 19th century , the barge canal still allows heavy cargo to travel through Utica at low cost , bypassing the New York State Thruway and providing intermodal freight transport with the railroads .

 For other ships of the same name , see SMS Prinz Adalbert 
 SMS Prinz Adalbert ( " His Majesty 's Ship Prince Adalbert " ) was an armored cruiser built in the early 1900s for the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) , named after Prince Adalbert of Prussia , former Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Prussian Navy . She was the lead ship of her class , which included a second ship , Friedrich Carl . Prinz Adalbert was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel . Her keel was laid in April 1900 , and she was launched in June 1901 . Her completion in January 1904 had been delayed by a surplus of construction projects at the Imperial Dockyard . She was armed with a main battery of four 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) guns , a significant improvement over the previous armored cruiser , Prinz Heinrich , which carried only two such guns . The ship was capable of a top speed of 20 kn ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . 
 Upon commissioning , Prinz Adalbert served as a gunnery training ship , a role she held for the majority of her career . She trained with the Heimatflotte ( Home Fleet ) , later renamed the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) , throughout the early 1900s , and she made several visits to foreign countries . After the outbreak of World War I in July 1914 , she was assigned to the reconnaissance forces in the Baltic and was tasked with protecting the German coast from Russian attacks . After her sister ship was sunk in November 1914 , she became the flagship of the cruiser squadron in the Baltic . She conducted operations against Russian forces , including bombarding the port of Libau in support of the German Army . She was torpedoed by a British submarine in July 1915 , but was able to return to port and was repaired . She was torpedoed a second time on 23 October 1915 ; the torpedo detonated her ammunition magazines and destroyed the ship . She sank quickly with heavy loss of life ; only three men were rescued from a crew of 675 . This proved to be the worst German naval disaster in the Baltic during the war .

 Prinz Adalbert displaced 9 @,@ 087 t ( 8 @,@ 943 long tons ) as built and 9 @,@ 875 t ( 9 @,@ 719 long tons ) fully loaded , with a length of 126 @.@ 5 m ( 415 ft 0 in ) , a beam of 19 @.@ 6 m ( 64 ft 4 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 43 m ( 24 ft 5 in ) forward . She was powered by three vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , with steam provided by fourteen coal @-@ fired boilers . The engines developed 17 @,@ 272 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 880 kW ) and yielded a maximum speed of 20 @.@ 4 knots ( 38 km / h ; 23 mph ) on trials . She carried up to 1 @,@ 630 t ( 1 @,@ 600 long tons ; 1 @,@ 800 short tons ) of coal , which enabled a maximum range of up to 5 @,@ 080 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 410 km ; 5 @,@ 850 mi ) at a cruising speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) .

 Prinz Adalbert was ordered under the provisional name " B " and built at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel under construction number 27 . Her keel was laid in April 1900 and she was launched on 22 June 1901 . The launching ceremony was attended by the Kaiser , Wilhelm II , his wife Kaiserin Augusta Victoria , his brother Admiral Prince Heinrich and Wilhem 's son , Prince Adalbert of Prussia . The ceremony of christening the ship was performed by Princess Irene of Prussia , wife of Prince Heinrich , who then delivered a speech . Fitting @-@ out work proceeded slowly , in large part the result of the Imperial Dockyard attempting to build too many ships at once , but the work was eventually completed by 12 January 1904 . Prinz Adalbert was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy the same day for sea trials , with Kapitän zur See ( Captain at Sea ) Hermann Jacobsen in command ; the ship was slated for service as a gunnery training ship . She had cost the Imperial German Government 16 @,@ 371 @,@ 000 Goldmarks . Sea trials were completed by 30 May , after which Prinz Adalbert began her duties as a gunnery training ship . 
 In September , the ship took part in the annual autumn maneuvers with the rest of the Heimatflotte ( Home Fleet ) . A special training unit consisting of reserve ships , training ships like Prinz Adalbert , and a flotilla of torpedo boats was created in early 1905 ; Prinz Adalbert was the flagship of the unit from 1905 to 1907 , flying the flag of Konteradmiral ( Rear Admiral ) Hugo Zeye . Prinz Adalbert and the light cruiser Berlin escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II 's yacht Hohenzollern to Sweden for a visit to King Oscar II in July 1905 . The following month , she joined the light cruisers Undine and Nymphe for training maneuvers off Swinemünde ; the exercises were to test the ships against a simulated night attack by torpedo boats . The tests were observed by Konteradmiral Ludwig Schröder , the Inspector of Naval Weapons , aboard Prinz Adalbert . Wilhelm II boarded Prinz Adalbert for the conclusion of the exercises , in which the ship towed an old torpedo boat filled with cork while the light cruisers and torpedo boats fired on it with live shells . Prinz Adalbert did not participate in the 1905 autumn maneuvers , though she was present for the naval review at the end of the exercises on 13 September . In February 1906 , the tender Fuchs was assigned to support Prinz Adalbert . From 17 to 28 June , the cruiser served as the flagship of Prince Heinrich , then the commander of the Baltic Sea Naval Station . During this period the ship traveled to Norway to take part in the coronation festivities for King Haakon VII . 
 The cruiser again took part in the autumn maneuvers in 1907 and 1909 . During the latter maneuvers , Prinz Adalbert took part in the Reserve Division , commanded again by Zeye , who had now been promoted to Vizeadmiral ( Vice Admiral ) . The ship served as the flagship of the III Scouting Group , under Konteradmiral Johannes Merten , who would go on to command the Ottoman fortifications at the Dardanelles during World War I. In March 1910 and March 1911 , Prinz Adalbert conducted gunnery tests in the northern North Sea and visited Tórshavn and Vestmanna in the Faeroe Islands . She visited Ålesund in Norway in July and August that year . The ship 's first period in service came to an end in September , following a large naval review in the Kiel roadstead for Wilhelm II and Archduke Franz Ferdinand , the heir to the Austro @-@ Hungarian throne , which began on 5 September . Prinz Adalbert was then decommissioned in Kiel on the 29th , with the armored cruiser Blücher taking her place as the fleet 's gunnery training ship . After a lengthy overhaul , Prinz Adalbert returned to service on 1 November 1912 , again with the artillery school . She was based in Sonderburg , where she replaced the armored cruiser Prinz Heinrich .

 At the outbreak of World War I in July 1914 , Prinz Adalbert was brought into front @-@ line service with the fleet , and Kapitän zur See Andreas Michelsen took command of the ship . She was assigned to the IV Scouting Group , under the command of Konteradmiral Hubert von Rebeur @-@ Paschwitz . On 26 August , she was sent to rescue the light cruiser Magdeburg , which had run aground earlier that day , though she was recalled after the Germans received word that Magdeburg 's crew had been forced to scuttle the ship . Prinz Adalbert was transferred to the North Sea on 7 September and was tasked two days later with protecting the minelaying cruisers Nautilus and Albatross and the auxiliary minelayer Kaiser while they laid a minefield to protect the southern entrance to the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal . The ship was briefly detached to guard the Great Belt after the Germans received false intelligence suggesting that British warships would try to penetrate the Baltic . She then joined the High Seas Fleet for a sortie into the North Sea on 2 – 4 November . 
 After her sister ship Friedrich Carl was sunk in November 1914 , Prinz Adalbert was detached from the III Scouting Group to replace her in the Coastal Defense Division in the Baltic on 29 November . She became the flagship for Admiral <unk> Behring , the commander of the cruiser detachment in the Baltic , on 7 December . On the 15th , she sortied with the light cruisers Augsburg , Lübeck , Amazone , and Thetis and several torpedo boats for a reconnaissance sweep toward the Åland Islands ; the ships returned to port on 18 December without having engaged Russian forces . Another sweep followed on 27 – 29 December , this time to cover a sortie by the Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleship of the V Battle Squadron toward Gotland . On 6 January 1915 , Prinz Adalbert , Thetis , Augsburg , Lübeck , and several torpedo boats and U @-@ boats went on a patrol toward Utö , where they discovered a Russian base for submarines . The Germans planned to attack the base with the torpedo boats and Thetis , since she had the shallowest draft , but due to a miscommunication , the attack was not carried out . 
 On 22 January 1915 , Prinz Adalbert , in company with Augsburg and several torpedo boats , conducted another reconnaissance sweep toward the Åland Islands . While on the return voyage , she bombarded Russian positions at Libau . She ran aground off <unk> during the operation , and Augsburg struck a mine off Bornholm . After being freed from her grounding , the ship was repaired ; Michelsen temporarily served as the detachment commander in place of Behring from 13 February to 9 March , when the ship was ready to return to service . Behring returned to Prinz Adalbert on 20 March . In the meantime , the Russians had briefly captured Memel . The Admiralstab ( Admiralty Staff ) detached the II Battle Squadron , II Scouting Group , and two flotillas of torpedo boats from the High Seas Fleet to reinforce the forces in the Baltic . The ships began to make diversionary attacks to support the German Army 's campaign to retake Memel ; Prinz Adalbert supported one such operation , a raid of the II Scouting Group into the Bothnian Sea to attack Russian merchant shipping on 23 March . The following day , the ships from the High Seas Fleet were recalled to the North Sea , leaving Behring 's cruisers alone once again . 
 Behring conducted one last operation from 13 to 17 April , with Prinz Adalbert , Thetis , and Lübeck , to support the minelayer Deutschland , which laid a minefield off Dagö . On the 20th , the Admiralstab instituted a reorganization of the Baltic Sea forces , and Behring was replaced with Konteradmiral Albert Hopman . At the same time , Michelsen was promoted to Hopman 's chief of staff , with his place as Prinz Adalbert 's commanding officer being taken by Kapitän zur See Wilhelm Bunnemann . The ship remained the flagship of the unit , and Hopman made his first cruise aboard the vessel from Kiel to Danzig on 27 April . At this time , Generalfeldmarschall ( General Field Marshal ) Paul von Hindenburg , the commander in chief of German forces on the Eastern Front , ordered a major assault on Libau . Hopman ordered his forces to support an attempt by the German Army to seize the city . The pre @-@ dreadnoughts of the IV Battle Squadron and the IV Scouting Group were allocated to Hopman 's command to provide additional support to the operation . The attack took place on 7 May , and consisted of Prinz Adalbert and the armored cruisers Roon and Prinz Heinrich , the elderly coast defense ship Beowulf , and the cruisers Augsburg , Thetis , and Lübeck . They were escorted by a number of destroyers , torpedo boats , and minesweepers . The bombardment went as planned , though the destroyer V107 struck a mine in Libau 's harbor , which blew off her bow and destroyed the ship . German ground forces were successful in their assault and they took the city . 
 On 1 July , the minelayer SMS Albatross , escorted by the cruisers Roon , Augsburg , and Lübeck and seven destroyers , laid a minefield north of Bogskär . While returning to port , the flotilla separated into two sections ; Augsburg , Albatross , and three destroyers made for Rixhöft while the remainder of the unit went to Libau . Augsburg and Albatross were intercepted by a powerful Russian squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Bakhirev , consisting of three armored and two light cruisers . Commodore Johannes von Karpf , the flotilla commander , ordered the slower Albatross to steam for neutral Swedish waters and recalled Roon and Lübeck . Albatross was grounded off Gotland and Augsburg escaped , and the Russian squadron briefly engaged Roon before both sides broke contact . Upon being informed of the situation , Hopman sortied with Prinz Adalbert and Prinz Heinrich to support von Karpf . While en route , the cruisers encountered the British submarine E9 , which scored a hit on Prinz Adalbert . The torpedo hit below the conning tower , caused severe damage , and killed ten men . Hopman transferred to the torpedo boat V99 while Michelsen remained aboard Prinz Adalbert to oversee the return to port . The ship took on some 2 @,@ 000 t ( 2 @,@ 000 long tons ; 2 @,@ 200 short tons ) of water ; her draft increased significantly , which prevented her from being able to put in to Danzig . She instead had to make the journey back to Kiel for repairs , which she reached on 4 July . 
 Repairs were finally completed by September 1915 . On 21 September , Prinz Adalbert joined a sortie to the Gulf of Finland with the battleships Braunschweig , Elsass , Mecklenburg , Schwaben , and Zähringen and the light cruiser Bremen . They encountered no Russian forces and returned to port on the 23rd . Another operation followed on 5 October ; this was in company with Prinz Heinrich and Bremen , and was to cover a minelayer as it laid a field to the northwest of <unk> . The ships completed their mission the next day and returned to port without incident . On 19 October , Hopman transferred his flag to Roon and ordered Prinz Adalbert to take up a patrol between Fårö and Dagerort . The ship was steaming some 20 miles west of Libau , en route to her patrol area , in company with a pair of destroyers on 23 October when she was intercepted by the submarine E8 . E8 fired a spread of torpedoes at a range of approximately 1 @,@ 200 m ( 1 @,@ 300 yd ) , detonating the ship 's ammunition magazine . The massive explosion destroyed the ship , which sank immediately with the loss of 672 crew . There were only three survivors . The sinking was the greatest single loss of life for the German Baltic forces during the war . 
 = Poohsticks = 
 Poohsticks is a sport first mentioned in The House at Pooh Corner , a Winnie @-@ the @-@ Pooh book by A. A. Milne . It is a simple sport which may be played on any bridge over running water ; each player drops a stick on the upstream side of a bridge and the one whose stick first appears on the downstream side is the winner . The annual World Poohsticks Championships have been held at Day 's Lock on the River Thames in the UK since 1984 . 
 = = History = = 
 Poohsticks was invented by English author A. A. Milne for his son Christopher Robin Milne . The sport first came to prominence when it was described in the author 's book The House at Pooh Corner as well as in the Disney animated featurette Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore . Winnie @-@ the @-@ Pooh , the protagonist of the book , accidentally drops a pine cone into a river from a bridge and , after observing how it appeared on the other side of the bridge , devises the rules for Poohsticks . Pooh continues to play the sport with the other characters , Christopher Robin , Tigger and Eeyore . 
 The sport was first developed at a bridge located in Ashdown Forest , close to the village of Upper <unk> , East Sussex , England . Built in 1907 and originally called <unk> Bridge , it is considered to be the bridge on which Milne and his son first played the game . However , it is uncertain whether the sport was first played at the bridge then written into the story , or vice versa . The bridge maintained the public 's interest and a campaign to rebuild it in the late seventies was considered important enough to feature on the BBC Nine O 'Clock News . The bridge was subsequently reopened by Christopher Robin Milne and officially renamed as Poohsticks Bridge . 
 The site was so popular that in 1999 the East Sussex county council made an appeal to Disney as the old wooden bridge had been worn down by an overwhelming number of visitors . The company provided a substantial donation towards the estimated £ 30 @,@ 000 needed to replace the bridge . Partly rebuilt in 1979 , the donations from Disney , building firms and members of the public funded its complete reconstruction . The newly built and modernised bridge retained its precursor 's original style . A plaque was also placed to commemorate the occasion and thank those who financially contributed to the project . The sport can still be played in Ashdown Forest to this day and the site regularly attracts tourists from as far afield as the United States and Japan . However , visitors are now advised to bring their own sticks , as previous visitors have caused damage to the trees in the vicinity . 
 = = Rules and strategy = = 
 A sport for two players or more , in the traditional version of <unk> the participants must drop a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge and run to the other side . The winner is the player whose stick first appears on the other side of the bridge . Alternatively , players may decide upon a starting point on a river and a finish line farther downstream . The winner is the player whose stick first passes the finishing point . 
 It is generally agreed that the stick must be made of organic materials , preferably willow , and not of any artificial materials . All participants must drop their sticks at the same time , usually after a referee shouts " drop " , " twitch " or any other agreed keyword . Additionally , no advantage may be gained through either dismantling the bridge or the use of any self @-@ propelling stick devices . The stick must be dropped , not thrown , into the water and any player who is deemed to have thrown their stick is disqualified . 
 Poohsticks is considered to be a sport of chance yet some players claim skill is involved . Some strategies involve the way in which the stick is held before it is dropped and trying to find the fastest route in the river . Author Ben Schott outlined a throwing method as a winning strategy in his third book , Schott ’ s Sporting , Gaming and Idling Miscellany , but his method was dismissed as cheating by competition organisers . In any event , the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path of the stick very difficult to predict and may vary according to the season . 
 The traditional game has inspired filmmakers and screenwriters and has been portrayed in the 1998 film Into My Heart with Rob Morrow and Claire Forlani , BBC sitcom To the Manor Born and also in a Marks & Spencer clothes advert where models , including Twiggy and Myleene Klass , played the game . The popularity of the game was underlined when it featured as a question on long @-@ running British quiz series University Challenge .

 <unk> @-@ <unk> 
 Following the closure of the short @-@ lived Oxford University Poohsticks Society , Poohsticks was brought to a larger audience by the World Poohsticks Championships . The Championships took place annually at Day 's Lock on the River Thames near Dorchester @-@ on @-@ Thames , Oxfordshire and have attracted over 1 @,@ 500 visitors to the event , including many international visitors . 
 The championships features an individual event and a six @-@ person team event . Players come from a wide variety of countries including the United States , Japan , Kenya , Australia and England . The event took place from Little Wittenham Bridge which is about 100 yards ( 91 m ) downstream of the lock . However , the event is currently looking for a new home . 
 The sporting event was started in 1984 by the <unk> , Lynn David , as a fund @-@ raising event for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution ( RNLI ) . He noticed that people occasionally snapped sticks from nearby hedges to play the sport and he then came up with the idea of a competition to aid the charity . He put out a box of sticks and a collection box and it soon became an annual event . In this version of the game , a finish line is set up farther downstream and the winner is the first to pass this point . The competition originally took place every January , but it was moved to March due to icy weather in 1997 . 
 The event proved popular with the local community and even attracted the attention of the foreign media . After Lynn David 's retirement , the running of the event was taken over by the Rotary Club of <unk> , based in nearby Wallingford . Additionally , the funds raised were divided between the RNLI and charitable projects supported by the Rotary Club . Twenty years after its first edition , the event had grown in popularity , attracting visitors from across the globe , and had been broadcast on television in countries including Russia , Japan and Czech Republic . Additionally , VisitBritain , the official British tourist board , named it as a highlight in its collection of " Quirky British Events " . Throughout its existence , it has raised around £ 30 @,@ 000 for the RNLI . 
 The Championships were at risk of decline when in 2008 the Rotary Club declared that its members were simply too old to stage an annual event of its size . The <unk> president , David Caswell stated : " The trouble is there is a lot of heavy work staging the event . Some of our members are over 70 , and it was just getting too much " . However , the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires declared that its members would continue hosting the event , thus preserving the competition for future generations . The President of Oxford Spires for 2008 – 2009 , Liz Williamson , stressed that it should continue as the event was popular locally and demonstrated quirky English nature to a worldwide audience . 
 Unfortunately during the initial preparations for 2015 event it was realized that the Little Wittenham site was no longer suitable . The reason given was that the logistics had become more difficult over the previous few years , as the event had become more popular and the use of the land had changed . This was announced by the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires on 7 January 2015 . 
 On 7 June 2015 the World Championships were moved to one of the cycle track bridges over the river Windrush in Langel Common , next to the <unk> Manor Farm Museum in Witney , Oxfordshire . The new location still retains a rural atmosphere while being only a few minutes walk from Witney town centre with its convenient public transport links to Oxford . Car Parking is also much closer than at the original location , which was a factor that influenced the choice of venue . As this was the first year at the new location , the organizers decided not to hold the 2015 team games .

 The winners of both the individual and team events receive a trophy , and the second- and third @-@ placed individuals and teams also receive a smaller trophy . Despite claims that the game involves skill more than luck , no team or individual has ever won the competition more than once .

 = Fairy Flag = 
 The Fairy Flag ( Scottish Gaelic : Am Bratach <unk> ) is an heirloom of the chiefs of Clan MacLeod . It is held in Dunvegan Castle along with other notable heirlooms , such as the Dunvegan Cup and Sir Rory Mor 's Horn . The Fairy Flag is known for the numerous traditions of fairies , and magical properties associated with it . The flag is made of silk , is yellow or brown in colour , and measures about 18 inches ( 46 cm ) squared . It has been examined numerous times in the last two centuries , and its condition has somewhat deteriorated . It is ripped and tattered , and is considered to be extremely fragile . The flag is covered in small red " elf dots " . In the early part of the 19th century , the flag was also marked with small crosses , but these have since disappeared . The silk of the flag has been stated to have originated in the Far East , and was therefore extremely precious , which led some to believe that the flag may have been an important relic of some sort . Others have attempted to associate the flag with the Crusades or even a raven banner , which was said to have been used by various Viking leaders in the British Isles . 
 There are numerous traditions and stories associated with the flag , most of which deal with its magical properties and mysterious origins . The flag is said to have originated as : a gift from the fairies to an infant chieftain ; a gift to a chief from a departing fairy @-@ lover ; a reward for defeating an evil spirit . The various powers attributed to the Fairy Flag include : the ability to multiply a clan 's military forces ; the ability to save the lives of certain <unk> ; the ability to cure a plague on cattle ; the ability to increase the chances of fertility ; and the ability to bring herring into the loch at Dunvegan . Some traditions relate that if the flag were to be unfurled and waved more than three times , it would either vanish , or lose its powers forever . 
 Clan tradition , preserved in the early 19th century , tells how the Fairy Flag was entrusted to a family of hereditary standard bearers . Only the eldest male of this family was ever allowed to unfurl the flag ; the first such hereditary standard bearer was given the honour of being buried inside the tomb of the chiefs , on the sacred isle of Iona . Tradition states that the flag was unfurled at several clan battles in the 15th and 16th centuries ; the flag 's magical powers are said to have won at least one of them . Another 19th century tradition linked the flag to a prophecy which foretold the downfall of Clan MacLeod ; but it also prophesied that , in the " far distant future " , the clan would regain its power and raise its honour higher than ever before . In the mid @-@ 20th century , the Fairy Flag was said to have extinguished a fire at Dunvegan Castle , and to have given luck to servicemen flying bombing missions in the Second World War . 
 = = Description = = 
 In the 19th century , the writer Rev. Norman Macleod ( 1783 – 1862 ) recalled seeing the Fairy Flag during his childhood around 1799 ( see relevant section below ) . He described the flag as then having crosses wrought in gold thread , and several " elf spots " stitched upon it . N. Macleod recollected that when the flag was examined , bits were taken off it from time to time ; so much so , that later in his life he did not believe the flag still existed . In August 1814 , Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle on the Isle of Skye , and wrote of the visit in his diary . One of several items he mentioned seeing was the Fairy Flag . Scott described it as " a pennon of silk , with something like round red rowan @-@ berries wrought upon it " . John Francis Campbell saw the flag in 1871 , and described it as being " made of yellow raw silk with figures and spots worked on it in red " . In 1927 , Roderick Charles MacLeod described the flag as then being square and brown . He measured it as about 18 inches ( 46 cm ) squared . He considered the flag to have originally been much larger ; and remarked on its extreme fragility and the requirement for careful handling , if it should be handled at all . R.C. MacLeod noted N. Macleod 's description of the flag , but observed that it now only contained the " elf spots " — there was then no evidence of any crosses upon what remained of the flag . R.C. MacLeod also observed that several tears in the flag had been carefully mended . 
 The flag was examined in the early 20th century by <unk> Wace of the Victoria and Albert Museum , who concluded that the silk was woven in either Syria or Rhodes , and the <unk> were made in the Near East . It was his opinion that the flag , in its original state , would have been quite precious , possibly a relic like the shirt of a saint . The belief at the time of this examination was the MacLeods were descended from Harald Hardrada , who spent some time in Constantinople in the 11th century . In line with this belief , it was suggested that the flag may have passed from Harald Hardrada down to the eponymous ancestor of the clan — Leod . The MacLeod Estate Office ( Dunvegan Castle ) website claims that experts have dated the flag to the 4th and 7th centuries — hundreds of years before the Crusades . The flag is currently held in Dunvegan Castle , along with other notable heirlooms such as the Dunvegan Cup and Sir Rory Mor 's Horn .

 = = = Thomas Pennant ( 1772 ) = = = 
 In 1772 , Thomas Pennant made a tour of the Hebrides and later published an account of his travels . One of the things Pennant noted while visiting the Isle of Skye , was the Fairy Flag . According to Pennant , the flag was named " <unk> shi " , and was given to the MacLeods by Titania the " Ben @-@ shi " , wife of Oberon , king of the fairies . Titania blessed the flag with powers which would manifest when the flag was unfurled three times . On the third time , the flag and flag @-@ bearer would be carried off by an invisible being , never to be seen again . The family of " Clan y <unk> " had the task of bearing the flag , and in return for their services , they possessed free lands in Bracadale . Pennant related how the flag had already been produced three times . The first occasion was in an unequal battle between the MacLeods and the Macdonalds of Clanranald . On the unfurling of the flag , the MacLeod forces were multiplied by ten . The second time the flag was unfurled to preserve the life of the lady of the clan , and thus saved the clan 's heir . Pennant then declared that the flag was unfurled a third time to save his own life . He stated that the flag was by then so tattered that Titania did not seem to think it worth taking back . Pennant also noted the belief of the MacLeod 's Norse ancestry and the magical raven banners said to have been used by the Vikings in the British Isles . 
 = = = 19th @-@ century manuscript accounts of the flag = = = 
 Much of the traditional history of the Fairy Flag is preserved in manuscript form . In the early part of the 20th century , Fred T. MacLeod noted one manuscript written around 1800 , which he considered to be the most detailed description of the flag . Another source of the flag 's traditional history is the Bannatyne manuscript , which documents the traditional history of Clan MacLeod . It dates to the 1830s , however , it is thought to have been based upon earlier traditions . 
 = = = = Description = = = = 
 The c.1800 manuscript stated that both the honour and the very existence of Clan MacLeod was thought to have depended upon the preservation of the Fairy Flag . Only the " highest and purest blood of the race " and the most renowned heroes , were selected to guard the flag when it was displayed . These twelve men , with a sword in hand , would stand just behind the chief who was always put in front . One family produced the hereditary keepers of the flag ; and of this family , only the eldest living male could unfurl the flag . This family was called " Clan <unk> Vic <unk> " ( " the children of Tormod , son of <unk> " ) , and was descended from Sìol Torcaill . The 20th century Hebridean author Alasdair Alpin MacGregor , when writing of the traditions of the flag , stated that the flag 's bearers held lands on Skye near Bracadale for their services to the chiefs of Clan MacLeod . The first of the flag bearers from this family was buried within the same grave as the chief of the clan , on the island of Iona . The second , and last bearer , was buried at St Clements Church , in Rodel , on the island of Harris . This man 's remains were covered by a magnificent monument ; the stone coffin in which his body was placed , was six feet deep . A moveable iron grate rested about two feet from the lid , and the man 's body rested upon the grate . The man 's male descendants were also deposited within this coffin . This meant that when a newly deceased was placed within , the bones and dust of the previous occupant were sifted through the grate into the coffin below . The writer of the manuscript stated that in the time of his own father , the last male of this family was interred this way . The tomb was then sealed by this man 's daughter . The c.1800 manuscript also noted that this family , prior to its extinction , became miserably poor . 
 = = = = <unk> at the Battle of Bloody Bay = = = = 
 The Bannatyne manuscript states that the flag was unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay in 1480 . The manuscript related that during the battle , the clan 's chief , William Dubh ( historically lived <unk> – 1480 ) , was slain , and in consequence his clan began to lose heart . A priest then ordered the flag 's bearer , Murcha Breac , to unfurl the Fairy Flag to rally the clan . Up until this point , the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan were on the opposing side of their kinsmen , the MacLeods of Lewis . However , once the MacLeods of Lewis noticed that the flag had been unfurled , they switched sides to join forces with their kinsmen . Unfortunately for both MacLeod clans , the outcome of the battle had already been determined and they were on the losing side . Among the vast numbers of MacLeods slain were Murcha Breac and the twelve guardians of the flag . William Dubh is buried on the island of Iona with his predecessors , and the body of Murcha Breac is placed within the same tomb . The manuscript states that this was the greatest honour which could be bestowed upon his remains . R.C. MacLeod suggested that the MacLeod effigy within Iona Abbey may mark the burial of the first chiefs of the clan , as well as William Dubh , and the mentioned standard bearer . William Dubh is thought to have been the last MacLeod chief buried on Iona ; his son , Alasdair <unk> ( 1450 – 1547 ) , was buried in St Clements Church , on Harris . 
 = = = = <unk> at the Battle of Glendale = = = = 
 According to the Bannatyne manuscript , the Fairy Flag was also unfurled during the Battle of Glendale , which the manuscript states to have been fought in about 1490 . At one point during this conflict , both the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan , and the MacLeods of Lewis , are on the verge of giving way to the invading MacDonalds . Just at this moment , the mother of Alasdair <unk> , chief of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan , orders the Fairy Flag to be unfurled . The result is that both MacLeod clans renew the battle with redoubled fury , and despite immense losses , eventually win the battle . Among the MacLeod dead is the flag bearer , Paul Dubh , who carried the Fairy Flag throughout the conflict until his death . The Bannatyne manuscript relates that Paul Dubh was honourably buried in a deep stone coffin , with a metal grate — much like the account given in the c.1800 manuscript . The writer of the Bannatyne manuscript states that each successive flag bearer was buried within this tomb , and that the writer 's own grandfather saw the old ceremony performed for the last time , in the 18th century . The Bannatyne manuscript states that the tomb is located in the north @-@ east corner of the chancel at St Clements Church , in Rodel . R.C. MacLeod noted that there was no trace of such a coffin or tomb ; although , he suggested that it could have been buried or possibly built within a wall . 
 = = = = Legend of origin = = = = 
 The c.1800 manuscript presented a legend of the Fairy Flag 's origin . This legend concerned a MacLeod who went on a Crusade to the Holy Land . On his journey homewards , the MacLeod attempted to cross a dangerous mountainous pass on the borders of Palestine . Here , he met a hermit who gave him food and shelter . The hermit warned the MacLeod of a dangerous spirit that guards the pass , which had never failed to destroy a true believer . However , with the aid of a piece of the True Cross and certain directions from the hermit , the MacLeod is able to defeat the " She Devil " — who is called " <unk> a <unk> , or Daughter of Thunder " . In reward for conveying some secrets that the spirit wanted some friends to know , she revealed to the MacLeod " the future destinies of the Clan " . The writer of the c.1800 manuscript stated that this knowledge was said to have been held by this man 's family until its extinction . The spirit then gave the Macleod her girdle , telling him to convert it into a banner . The MacLeod then used his spear as a flag pole . The writer of the c.1800 manuscript stated that the spear was by then since lost , and that the secrets conveyed to MacLeod were lost forever . The writer also gave his own opinion on the origin of the Fairy Flag . The writer stated that the flag most probably originated as a banner used in the Holy Land , and that it was conveyed back home by the character portrayed in the legend . 
 = = = = Other episodes = = = = 
 The c.1800 manuscript related that the spell of the banner meant that it would vanish when it was displayed for the third time . The final unfurling of the banner would either gain the clan a complete victory over their enemies or meant that the clan was to suffer total extinction . The writer of the c.1800 manuscript went on to state that the temptation for unfurling the flag for the third and final time was always resisted ; and that at the time of his writing , there was not much chance of it ever being unfurled again , since it was in such a reduced state . The writer stated that of the few shreds that remained , he himself possessed a fragment . 
 The c.1800 manuscript also stated that the flag was once held in an iron chest , within Dunvegan Castle . The key to the chest was then always in the possession of the hereditary flag bearers . The c.1800 manuscript related how , on the death of the MacLeod chief Tormod , son of lain Breac , the succession to the chiefship nearly fell to the family of the MacLeods of Talisker . The young widow of the last chief refused to give up Dunvegan Castle to the next heir , knowing herself to be pregnant ( although she had only been married six weeks previous to her widowhood ) . In time , she gave birth to Tormod , the next chief . The c.1800 manuscript stated that at around this time , a man who wished to curry favour with the expectant heir ( MacLeod of Talisker ) attempted to steal the flag . Even though the Fairy Flag was later found , both the staff and iron chest were never seen again . Historically , the old chief , Tormod ( son of Iain Breac ) , died in the autumn of 1706 , and his son , Tormod , was born in July 1705 . 
 = = = Reported partial fulfilment prophecy around 1800 = = = 
 Late in his life , the writer Norman Macleod ( 1783 – 1862 ) related to one of his daughters of having heard an old Gaelic prophecy concerning the flag , and of events which took place in his childhood which were reported as examples of the prophecy being partially fulfilled . A summarised version of this prophecy was published in the late 19th century , within an account of the life of one of his sons . Soon after , in 1878 , Alexander Mackenzie proposed that the prophecy as dictated by N. Macleod , may have been a fragmented remembrance of one of the prophecies of <unk> <unk> ( who is popularly known as the <unk> Seer ) . N. Macleod 's tale of the prophecy is as follows : 
 N. Macleod then related how as a child , he had been close to an English smith employed at Dunvegan . One day the smith told him in secrecy that the chest in which the flag was held was to be forced open the next morning , and that it had been arranged by Hector Macdonald Buchanan that the smith would be at the castle with the necessary tools . N. Macleod then asked Buchanan for permission to be present , and was granted leave on the condition that he not tell anyone — especially the chief — what was about to be done . The next morning the chest was forced open and the flag was found to be held within a wooden case . N. Macleod described the flag then as being a square @-@ shaped piece of cloth with crosses wrought on it with gold thread , and several " elf spots " stitched onto it . After the flag had been examined , it was placed back into its case . N. Macleod stated that at around this time it was learned that the heir to the chiefship , Norman , was killed at sea . The HMS Queen Charlotte , on which he was a lieutenant , caught fire and exploded at sea killing 673 officers and men . N. Macleod stated that at about the same time , MacLeod 's Maidens were sold to Campbell of <unk> . He also stated that he personally saw a fox with cubs , which lived in the west turret of the castle . N. Macleod related how he was grateful that the worst part of the prophecy remained unfulfilled ; and that the chiefly family still owned their ancestral lands . 
 R.C. MacLeod , who wrote in the early 20th century , considered that this prophecy seemed to have been fulfilled . At that time , the Macleod chief had no gentlemen of his clan as tenants on his estate ; also , an heir to the family — named Ian Breac — was killed in the First World War . R.C. MacLeod noted that the prophecy stated that a " John Breac " ( Gaelic : Iain Breac , " Iain the speckled " ) would restore the fortunes of the family . R.C.
