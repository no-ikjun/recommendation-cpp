 = Battle of Lechaeum = 
 The Battle of Lechaeum ( 391 BC ) was an Athenian victory in the Corinthian War . In the battle , the Athenian general Iphicrates took advantage of the fact that a Spartan hoplite regiment operating near Corinth was moving in the open without the protection of any missile throwing troops . He decided to ambush it with his force of javelin throwers , or peltasts . By launching repeated hit @-@ and @-@ run attacks against the Spartan formation , Iphicrates and his men were able to wear the Spartans down , eventually routing them and killing just under half . This marked one of the first occasions in Greek military history on which a force of peltasts had defeated a force of hoplites ( heavy infantry ) . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In 392 BC , a civil war had taken place at Corinth , in which a group of pro @-@ Spartan oligarchs was defeated and exiled by anti @-@ Spartan democrats . Those exiles cooperated with Spartan forces in the region to gain control of Corinth 's port on the Corinthian Gulf , Lechaeum . They then repulsed several attacks on the port by the democrats at Corinth and their Theban and Argive allies and secured their hold over the port . 
 The Athenians then sent out a force to assist in garrisoning Corinth , with Iphicrates commanding the peltasts . The Spartans and the exiles , meanwhile , raided Corinthian territory from Lechaeum , and in 391 BC King Agesilaus led a large Spartan army to the area and attacked a number of strongpoints , winning a number of successes . The Athenians and their allies were largely bottled up in Corinth , but eventually found an opportunity to take advantage of Spartan negligence . 
 = = Battle = = 
 While Agesilaus moved about Corinthian territory with the bulk of his army , he left a sizable force at Lechaeum to guard the port . Part of this force at Lechaeum was composed of men from the city of <unk> , who traditionally returned home for a certain religious festival when on campaign . With this festival approaching , the Spartan commander at Lechaeum marched out with a force of hoplites and cavalry to escort the <unk> past Corinth on their way home . After successfully leading his force well past the city , the commander ordered his hoplites to turn and return to Lechaeum , while the cavalry continued on with the <unk> . Although he would be marching near the walls of the city of Corinth with his force , he expected no trouble , believing that the men in the city were thoroughly cowed and unwilling to march out . 
 The Athenian commanders in Corinth , Iphicrates , who commanded the peltasts , and Callias , who commanded the hoplites , saw that an entire Spartan mora , or regiment , of 600 men was marching past the city unprotected by either peltasts or cavalry , and decided to take advantage of this fact . Accordingly , the Athenian hoplites drew up a little outside Corinth , while the peltasts went after the Spartan force in pursuit , flinging javelins at the Spartan hoplites . 
 To stop this , the Spartan commander ordered some of his men to charge the Athenians , but the peltasts fell back , easily outrunning the hoplites , and then , when the Spartans turned to return to the regiment , the peltasts fell upon them , flinging spears at them as they fled , and inflicted casualties . This process was repeated several times , with similar results . Even when a group of Spartan cavalrymen arrived , the Spartan commander made the curious decision that they should keep pace with the hoplites in pursuit , instead of racing ahead to ride down the fleeing peltasts . Unable to drive off the peltasts , and suffering losses all the while , the Spartans were driven back to a hilltop overlooking Lechaeum . The men in Lechaeum , seeing their predicament , sailed out in small boats to as close as to the hill as they could reach , about a half mile away . The Athenians , meanwhile , began to bring up their hoplites , and the Spartans , seeing these two developments , broke and ran for the boats , pursued by the peltasts all the way . All in all , in the fighting and pursuit , 250 of the 600 men in the regiment were killed . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 News of the Spartan defeat , accordingly , was a profound shock to Agesilaus , who soon returned home to Sparta . In the months following Agesilaus ' departure , Iphicrates reversed many of the gains that the Spartans had made near Corinth , recapturing three of the forts that the Spartans had previously seized and garrisoned . He also launched several successful raids against Spartan allies in the region . Although the Spartans and their oligarchic allies continued to hold Lechaeum for the duration of the war , they curtailed their operations around Corinth , and no further major fighting occurred in the region . 
 = No. 34 Squadron RAAF = 
 No. 34 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) VIP transport squadron . It operates Boeing 737 Business Jets and Bombardier Challenger 604s from Defence Establishment Fairbairn in Canberra . The squadron was formed in February 1942 for standard transport duties during World War II , initially flying de Havilland DH.84 Dragons in Northern Australia . In 1943 it re @-@ equipped with Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas , which it operated in New Guinea and the Dutch East Indies prior to disbanding in June 1946 . 
 The unit was re @-@ established in March 1948 as No. 34 ( Communications ) Squadron at RAAF Station Mallala , South Australia , where it supported activities at the Woomera Rocket Range before disbanding in October 1955 . It was re @-@ raised as No. 34 ( VIP ) Flight in March 1956 at RAAF Base Canberra ( later Fairbairn ) . No. 34 Flight was redesignated No. 34 ( Special Transport ) Squadron in July 1959 , and No. 34 Squadron in June 1963 . During the 1960s it operated Dakotas , Convair Metropolitans , Vickers Viscounts , Dassault Falcon @-@ <unk> , Hawker Siddeley HS 748s , and BAC 1 @-@ 11s , the last three types continuing in service until the late 1980s . The squadron 's fleet consisted solely of Dassault Falcon 900s from 1989 until 2002 , when it began operating the 737 and Challenger . 
 = = Role and equipment = = 
 No. 34 Squadron is the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) unit responsible for the transport of VIPs , including members of the Australian government , the Governor @-@ General , and visiting dignitaries . It is based at Defence Establishment Fairbairn in Canberra , and administered by No. 84 Wing , which is part of Air Mobility Group . The squadron has a secondary role providing emergency transport during humanitarian operations . Its motto is Eo et <unk> ( " I Go and I Return " ) . 
 As of 2011 , No. 34 Squadron 's strength included around thirty pilots and thirty flight attendants . Captains are generally senior pilots who have previously flown the RAAF 's Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster , Lockheed C @-@ 130 Hercules , or Lockheed AP @-@ 3C Orion . Their co @-@ pilots are new RAAF personnel who have recently graduated from No. 2 Flying Training School , and the crew attendants are posted to the squadron after completing training and a period of service with No. 33 Squadron . The squadron 's VIP Operations Cell ( <unk> ) is responsible for managing requests for VIP air transport as well as dedicated security staff . Most logistical support , including meal preparation , is provided under commercial arrangements rather than by RAAF personnel . 
 No. 34 Squadron operates two Boeing 737 Business Jets and three Bombardier Challenger 604s . The aircraft are leased from , and maintained by , the Special Purpose Aircraft Business Unit of Qantas Defence Services in Fairbairn . The lease commenced in 2002 and is due to expire in 2014 . The twin @-@ engined Boeing Business Jet ( BBJ ) is crewed by two pilots and up to four flight attendants , and can carry thirty passengers . The twinjet Challenger has a crew of two pilots and one flight attendant , and carries up to nine passengers . The BBJ , which has a range of over 11 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 6 @,@ 800 mi ) , is generally used for long @-@ range transport , and the Challenger on shorter routes . The jets are classified as " Special Purpose Aircraft " , meaning that their tasking is governed by Federal guidelines for carrying " entitled persons " on official business . To minimise government outlay , the jets may not be employed when available commercial flights satisfy the timing , location and security requirements of a given task . No. 34 Squadron conducts between 1 @,@ 200 and 1 @,@ 800 flights each year . A Schedule of Special Purpose Flights is tabled twice annually in Federal Parliament . <unk> usually assigns one of No. 34 Squadron 's aircraft to approved tasks , but other Australian Defence Force aircraft are occasionally used for tasks not suited to the BBJ or Challenger ; for instance , Prime Minister Julia Gillard travelled to China on board a No. 33 Squadron Airbus KC @-@ 30A Multi Role Tanker Transport in April 2013 .

 During February and March 1942 , the RAAF formed four transport units : Nos. 33 , 34 , 35 and 36 Squadrons . No. 34 ( Transport ) Squadron was established on 23 February at RAAF Station Darwin , Northern Territory , four days after the city was bombed for the first time . Coming under the control of North @-@ Western Area Command , the squadron 's initial strength was six personnel and two de Havilland DH.84 Dragons . They were immediately tasked with transport duties in northern Australia . As well as carrying freight , this involved collecting the first Japanese prisoner of war to be captured in Australia , a navy fighter pilot who had crashlanded during the raid on Darwin . One of the squadron 's two officers , Flight Lieutenant J.W. Warwick , became the first ( acting ) commanding officer on 2 March . The following day , one of the Dragons was destroyed on the ground at Wyndham , Western Australia , by enemy air attack . With its other aircraft unserviceable , and accommodation at Darwin 's civil airfield inadequate , squadron headquarters relocated to Daly Waters Airfield on 5 March . On 14 March another Dragon was allocated ; this was joined by two Avro Ansons and two de Havilland Tiger Moths in mid @-@ May , by which time the squadron had moved to Batchelor Airfield . By the end of the month , the squadron had thirty @-@ four personnel , including six officers . It lost one of the Tiger Moths to a bushfire on 1 July , a few days after the plane crashlanded south of Katherine . The squadron relocated again on 15 July , this time to Hughes Airfield . It remained at Hughes until 27 August , when it transferred to <unk> Airfield ; it operated from <unk> until it was temporarily disbanded on 13 December and its aircraft transferred to No. 6 Communications Flight . 
 No. 34 Squadron was re @-@ formed on 3 January 1943 at Parafield Airport , South Australia , from elements of No. 36 Squadron formerly based at Essendon , Victoria . Initially comprising ninety @-@ six personnel and eight aircraft , by the end of the month the squadron 's strength had been reduced to seventy personnel and three Dragons operating in South Australia and the Northern Territory . On 11 March one of the Dragons was destroyed on takeoff at Parafield , causing two deaths — No. 34 Squadron 's first fatalities . Another Dragon was lost in a fire after it crashlanded near Tennant Creek in April . Beginning in May 1943 , the Dragons were augmented by Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas , giving the squadron a total strength of three Dakotas and two Dragons by the following month . By July , No. 34 Squadron was operating five Dakotas , which had fully replaced the Dragons , and in August its strength stood at seven Dakotas and 153 personnel , including forty @-@ seven officers . It subsequently received an Airspeed Oxford and a Douglas DC @-@ 2 , and began making supply drops and medical evacuations as far north as Port Moresby , New Guinea . The squadron had its busiest month in May 1944 , transporting almost 1 @,@ 900 passengers and over 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 pounds ( 450 @,@ 000 kg ) of cargo . On 1 June it became the first operational RAAF squadron to have personnel of the Women 's Auxiliary Australian Air Force ( WAAAF ) in its ranks , a contingent made up of an officer and twenty <unk> . The WAAAF had been formed in 1941 and eventually made up thirty @-@ one per cent of RAAF ground staff ; its members were primarily employed in technical trades and were not permitted to serve in combat theatres . 
 October 1944 saw a detachment of the squadron operating from Cape York in Far North Queensland to bases in the Dutch East Indies . Additional detachments were located at Townsville , Queensland , and Coomalie Creek , Northern Territory . In February 1945 , No. 34 Squadron commenced a relocation to Morotai in the Dutch East Indies , under the control of the Australian First Tactical Air Force , and was fully established at its new base by mid @-@ April . The squadron supported the invasion of Borneo , and its Dakotas were the first Allied aircraft to land at Labuan and Tarakan after the islands were captured . It remained at Morotai until the end of the war , at which time it became involved in repatriating Australian former prisoners of war from Singapore , and then in courier flights supporting the formation of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan . No. 34 Squadron returned to Australia between January and March 1946 and disbanded at RAAF Station Richmond , New South Wales , on 6 June . 
 The squadron was re @-@ established at RAAF Station Mallala , South Australia , on 1 March 1948 , when No. 2 ( Communications ) Squadron was renamed No. 34 ( Communications ) Squadron . It operated as a VIP transport , courier and reconnaissance unit , primarily in support of the Woomera rocket range , focal point of the Anglo @-@ Australian Long Range Weapons Project during the Cold War . No. 34 ( Communications ) Squadron flew the only Vickers Viking to be taken on strength by the RAAF , and was also the only RAAF squadron to operate the Bristol Freighter . Three Freighters were taken on strength in April and May 1949 , and a fourth in September 1951 ; one was lost with all three crew members in a crash near Mallala on 25 November 1953 after its wing failed in flight . The squadron also operated Percival Prince , Auster , Dakota and Anson aircraft , undertaking regular transport duties and disaster relief along with its Woomera support work before disbanding at Mallala on 28 October 1955 . 
 = = = VIP operations = = = 
 No. 34 ( VIP ) Flight was established at RAAF Base Canberra on 12 March 1956 , and charged with the safe carriage of the Governor @-@ General , senior Australian politicians and military officers , and visiting foreign dignitaries . It was formed from the VIP Flight of No. 36 Squadron , under No. 86 ( Transport ) Wing . The VIP Flight had absorbed the RAAF 's Governor @-@ General 's Flight in October 1950 . In its first year of operation , No. 34 Flight carried the Duke of Edinburgh on his tour of Australia . It was equipped with two Convair 440 Metropolitans , as well as Dakotas . The flight remained in Canberra when No. 86 Wing relocated to Richmond in 1958 . On 1 July 1959 , it was re @-@ formed as No. 34 ( Special Transport ) Squadron , leaving the control of No. 86 Wing to become an independent unit directly administered by Home Command and tasked by RAAF Base Canberra . " Possibly because of the rank of its clients " , contended the official history of the post @-@ war Air Force , the squadron maintained higher standards than other transport units , adopting some procedures from the civil aviation world . It also benefitted from the personal interest of senior officials when it came to upgrading its equipment , though this had some negative aspects . The acquisition of the Metropolitans , the first pressurised aircraft in the VIP fleet , was organised by Minister for Air Athol Townley without any advance discussion with the RAAF . Although the Air Force raised performance and safety concerns , the type 's entry into service was a fait accompli , and it remained on strength for twelve years . Until the early 1960s , the VIP unit also operated two de Havilland Vampire jets and two CAC Winjeel trainers to allow staff officers at Canberra 's Department of Air to maintain their flying proficiency . 
 No. 34 ( Special Transport ) Squadron 's home in Canberra was renamed RAAF Base Fairbairn in March 1962 , and the unit was redesignated No. 34 Squadron on 13 June 1963 . That year , the squadron carried Queen Elizabeth II for the first time . In October 1964 , two second @-@ hand Vickers Viscount turboprop transports were obtained to supplement the Dakotas and <unk> ; the two piston @-@ engine types were withdrawn after the delivery of two Hawker Siddeley HS 748s beginning in April 1967 and three Dassault Falcon 20 jets ( known as <unk> in RAAF service ) in June . Two BAC 1 @-@ 11 jets joined the squadron on 19 January 1968 , and the two Viscounts were retired in March the following year . The wholesale re @-@ equipment of the VIP fleet in the late 1960s was controversial , and questions were raised in Parliament regarding its cost and operations . The so @-@ called " VIP affair " led to more stringent guidelines governing No. 34 Squadron 's tasking , requiring approval for flights to be made by the British Royal Family , the Governor @-@ General , the Prime Minister , or the Minister for Air . Eligibility criteria were also codified , and potential passengers included Federal ministers , opposition leaders , " individuals of similar status and importance visiting Australia " , two @-@ star officers and above , and other dignitaries of similar status . During the 1970s one of No. 34 Squadron 's BAC 1 @-@ 11s experienced an engine failure over the Tasman Sea while carrying Prime Minister Gough Whitlam to New Zealand . The aircraft made a safe landing in Australia , but the incident led the RAAF to investigate using three- or four @-@ engined aircraft for future VIP flights involving long over @-@ water legs . The government eventually purchased two Boeing 707s from Qantas to perform long @-@ range VIP flights and to improve the RAAF 's strategic transport capabilities . Entering service in 1979 , they joined the newly established No. 33 Flight ( later No. 33 Squadron ) in 1981 . More 707s were acquired between 1983 and 1988 , and four were converted for air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling in the early 1990s . 
 In 1984 , No. 34 Squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup for its proficiency . It again became part of No. 86 Wing in June 1988 , though its tasking continued to be controlled by the Governor @-@ General , the Prime Minister , and the Minister for Defence . Commencing in September 1989 , the twinjet <unk> and BAC 1 @-@ 11s were replaced by five trijet Dassault Falcon 900s leased from Hawker Pacific , the first time the RAAF had leased aircraft from a commercial company . The two HS 748s were transferred to the newly formed No. 32 Squadron at RAAF Base East Sale , Victoria . Responsibility for servicing the Falcon 900s was shared by No. 34 Squadron and Hawker Pacific , the latter performing heavy maintenance . In an unusual operation for the squadron , one of the Falcons was dispatched to Jordan in September 1990 to evacuate thirteen Australian citizens who had been held hostage in Iraq . On 21 December 1992 , a Falcon 900 became the first RAAF aircraft to take part in United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Somalia , when it departed RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , with a team of Australian Army personnel to reconnoitre the theatre of operations . The squadron received a commendation from the Chief of the Defence Force , General Peter Gration , shortly before his retirement in 1993 . In January 1998 , No. 84 Wing was organised as a special transport wing under Air Lift Group ( renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014 ) . The term " special transport " referred to activities not directly related to army support , such as carrying VIPs . Headquartered at Richmond , No. 84 Wing took control of Nos. 32 , 33 and 34 Squadrons . A flight by one of No. 34 Squadron 's Falcons preceded INTERFET operations in East Timor in 1999 , carrying senior Australian military and diplomatic staff into Dili on a goodwill mission . 
 The Falcon 900s were replaced by two Boeing 737 Business Jets and three Bombardier Challenger 604s in July 2002 . The new aircraft also replaced the two Boeing 707s operated by No. 33 Squadron in the VIP transport role . The 707s had permitted journalists to travel with the Prime Minister on international flights , and in replacing the bigger jets with 737s the Liberal government of the time determined that media contingents covering VIP trips should travel on civil aircraft . This decision led to controversy in 2007 , after the crash of a Garuda airliner killed four Australian government officials and a journalist travelling in connection with a visit to Indonesia by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer , who had flown on a Challenger . No. 34 Squadron and Qantas Defence Services marked 20 @,@ 000 incident @-@ free flying hours with the 737s and Challengers on 21 October 2008 . The following year saw further controversy when Prime Minister Kevin Rudd had to apologise for remarks to a cabin attendant over the meal he was served on one of the jets . In 2011 , the squadron provided VIP transport during tours of Australia by Queen Elizabeth , Prince William , and Frederik and Mary of Denmark , as well as support for US President Barack Obama 's visit to Canberra . It also flew senior government and military personnel in support of relief efforts during the Queensland floods , and was again awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency . No. 34 Squadron celebrated its 70th anniversary at Parliament House , Canberra , on 18 February 2012 ; the following day , a memorial to its first fatalities in March 1942 was unveiled at Fairbairn . The lease on its aircraft is due to expire in 2014 , and they may be replaced with new types . 
 = SR U class = 
 The SR U class were 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 ( mogul ) steam locomotives designed by Richard Maunsell for passenger duties on the Southern Railway ( SR ) . The class represented the penultimate stage in the development of the Southern Railway ’ s mogul " family " , which improved upon the basic principles established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer ( CME ) George Jackson Churchward for Great Western Railway ( GWR ) locomotives . The U class design drew from experience with the GWR 4300 and N classes , improved by applying Midland Railway ideas to the design , enabling the SECR to influence development of the 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 in Britain . 
 The U class was designed in the mid @-@ 1920s for production at a time when more obsolete 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 locomotives were withdrawn , and derived from Maunsell ’ s earlier SECR K ( “ River ” ) class 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 4 tank locomotives . The first 20 members of the U class were rebuilds of the K class locomotives , one of which was involved in the Sevenoaks railway accident . A further 20 U class locomotives were built in 1928 to fill the gap in cross @-@ country and semi @-@ fast express passenger services after the withdrawal of the K class . The design also continued the standardisation of the Southern Railway locomotive fleet by using parts designed to be interchangeable with other Maunsell @-@ designed classes . 
 A total of 50 locomotives were built over three batches between 1928 and 1931 , and the design formed the basis for the 3 @-@ cylinder U1 class of 1928 . They were able to operate over most of the Southern Railway network , gaining the nickname " U @-@ Boats " after the submarine warfare of the First World War , and continued to operate with British Railways ( BR ) . The class saw continuous use until 1966 , when all members of the U class were withdrawn from service . Four U class locomotives have been preserved on two heritage railways in the south of England . 
 = = Background = = 
 The history of the U class is complex as it is linked to the fate of the 2 @-@ cylinder K ( " River " ) class 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 4 tank locomotives . The design work had for a new passenger 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 with 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) driving wheels was complete by 1927 , when the involvement of a K class locomotive in the Sevenoaks rail crash presented an opportunity to bring forward construction of the class . The K class tank engines were the passenger counterpart to the N class 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 mixed @-@ traffic design , and were noted for rough @-@ riding over the cheaply laid track of the former SECR . The class was withdrawn from service , and the inquiry that followed determined that the rough @-@ riding contributed to the crash . Its recommendation was that the K class should be rebuilt to 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 tender locomotives , using tried and tested features used by Maunsell and his assistant , the former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft on the N class . 
 The N class principles applied to the U class design aided mass production , and incorporated several features found on the GWR 4300 Class locomotives designed by Churchward . An order made in 1926 for a second batch of 20 K class locomotives was delayed until 1928 , when the specification was revised to construct U class locomotives . It was intended to replace several elderly 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 classes within the former SECR 's running fleet , and attempted to standardise and ease maintenance of locomotives by sharing parts with other Maunsell designs . The style of the new locomotive reflected the Midland Railway influence of another of Maunsell ’ s assistants , the ex @-@ Midland Railway engineer James Clayton . The addition of a tender increased the operating range of the U class over its K class predecessors , and the wheel arrangement applied to the former K class locomotives improved the locomotive ’ s stability when operational . 
 = = Construction details = = 
 = = = K class rebuilds = = = 
 The rebuilding programme that followed the derailment of K class No . A800 " River Cray " at Sevenoaks began at Ashford works in June 1928 . The work involved in converting a 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 4 tank engine to a 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 tender locomotive included the removal of the side water tanks , rear coal bunker and trailing axles , although the 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) driving wheels , right @-@ hand drive and N class – type boiler were retained . The aesthetic aspects inherited from the K class were the former Midland Railway engineer James Clayton ’ s contributions to the design , creating a simple , functional locomotive similar to the N class . 
 The rebuilt locomotives were given a tender and a re @-@ designed cab that bore a strong resemblance to those featured on designs by Henry Fowler . Two designs of Maunsell tender were used , the straight @-@ sided 3 @,@ 500 imperial gallons ( 15 @,@ 911 l ) variety , and the larger 4 @,@ 000 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 18 @,@ 184 l ) design used on later batches of the N class with inward @-@ sloping raves to prevent coal spillage . The first rebuild was No . <unk> River Camel , which also became the first U class locomotive into service in March 1928 , three months before the first production locomotive under construction at Brighton . The rapid turnaround was achieved as design work was already in place , and the rebuilding of existing locomotives was cheaper than building from scratch . 
 No . <unk> was put on performance trials prior to work commencing on rebuilding of the rest of the class at Brighton and Eastleigh works . The rebuilds lost their names because of the bad publicity attached to the " River " class after the 1927 crash , and the heavily damaged No . A800 was the last member of the K class to be rebuilt to U class configuration in December 1928 . The unique 3 @-@ cylinder " River " tank , K1 class No . A890 River Frome was also rebuilt to the general U class specification , becoming the prototype of Maunsell 's 3 @-@ cylinder U1 class derivative in June 1928 . 
 = = = First production batch and differences with rebuilt locomotives = = = 
 Construction of the delayed 1926 order for 20 K class locomotives began in 1928 after alteration to the U class specification . As a result of Harold Holcroft ’ s position as one of Maunsell ’ s assistants , the new @-@ builds also displayed the Churchward GWR 4300 Class influence . The ideas applied to this class were already used on the N , N1 and K class rebuilds , including long @-@ travel valves for fast running , Belpaire firebox and conical boilers , constructed at the North British Locomotive Works in Glasgow . The first of the production batch emerged from Brighton works in August 1928 and featured a tapered chimney and smokebox snifting valves , both of which were used on the K and N class locomotives . 
 The 20 locomotives of the first production batch were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works , and all were completed by December 1929 . The production locomotives had a slightly different profile to the K class rebuilds and featured left @-@ hand drive to improve the visibility of signals from the driver 's side of the footplate . They also had higher running plates along the sides of the boiler than the rebuilds , which required smaller wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving wheels . Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers , as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class . 
 In common with the N , N1 and K class locomotives , the Midland Railway influence of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch , as the water top @-@ feed into the boiler was located inside a dome , whilst the cab area was a modified version of those on the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ 0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds . The rebuilds had Midland Railway @-@ style double spectacle plates ( the small windows on the front face of the cab ) left over from the K class cabs , whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler . Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway ’ s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives . However , all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice , as the superheating surface area was increased , and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear . 
 = = = Second production batch and modifications = = = 
 The second batch of ten new @-@ build U class locomotives was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service . This brought the total of new @-@ build locomotives to 30 , and the total number of operational U class engines to 50 . The new batch also featured detail differences from the rest of the class , such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive , though continued to use the standard left @-@ hand drive cab layout to improve the driver ’ s forward vision from the cab . Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision . The smokebox snifting valves applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid , who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting . 
 = = Operational details = = 
 The U class was a reliable and economical design more than capable of attaining speeds in excess of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) as a result of being fitted with long @-@ travel valves . They had high capacity , tapered boilers which promoted free steaming , and 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) driving wheels which allowed fast running over long distances . They were distributed more widely than their N class counterparts , although one drawback in operating the class was the size of the cylinders and cab , which meant the U class was out of gauge for the Tonbridge @-@ Hastings line due to inadequate clearances in tunnels along the route . Otherwise , their " go anywhere " nature earned them the nickname of " U @-@ Boats " , and crews praised their abilities to achieve what they were designed to do . 
 The Southern Railway operating department undertook trials to improve fleet efficiency . When built , Eastbourne @-@ based No . <unk> was fitted with an experimental pulverised fuel burner of German design ; the experiment was terminated when a minor explosion was caused by the powdered coal coming into contact with sparks thrown from the blastpipe . The experiment also proved that pulverised coal was a false economy , as much of the fine dust was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place . The locomotive was returned to normal coal burning in 1935 . In 1947 the class became a test @-@ bed for a government @-@ backed scheme regarding fuelling arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage . Two of the class , Nos. 1625 and 1797 , were converted to oil burning , with more set to follow suit ; but the project was abandoned and the two oil burners were reverted to coal @-@ firing before this could take place . 
 All members of the class entered British Railways service in 1948 , and from 1955 23 of the U class received chimneys of the British Railways Standard Class 4 variety and replacement cylinders , which had become worn through intensive use . A few members of the class were given replacement frames at overhaul with a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and smokebox . During the early 1960s , the withdrawal of the ageing T9 class designed by Dugald Drummond saw the U class replacing them on services west of Exeter , though their large wheels offered little advantage on the steeper gradients that characterised this part of the railway network . The favoured form of 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 motive power west of Exeter was the smaller @-@ wheeled N class , while heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid ’ s Unrebuilt Light Pacifics , which were within the weight restrictions imposed in this area . The U class represented one of the less glamorous classes of passenger locomotive due to the fact that they were used mainly on mixed @-@ traffic and secondary passenger duties .

The class was initially numbered in the Southern Railway 's post @-@ grouping system from <unk> – <unk> for the K class rebuilds , and <unk> – <unk> with the production batches . The " A " in the numbering system denotes Ashford , where the locomotive design had originated . Southern numbering policy was eventually rationalised , and final batch of 15 locomotives , built between 1932 and 1934 , were numbered 1400 – 1414 without the " A " prefix .

 = Nothing to My Name = 
 " Nothing to My Name " ( also known as " I Have Nothing " ) is a 1986 Mandarin @-@ language rock song by Cui Jian . It is widely considered Cui 's most famous and most important work , and one of the most influential songs in the history of the People 's Republic of China , both as a seminal point in the development of Chinese rock and roll and as a political sensation . The song was an unofficial anthem for Chinese youth and activists during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 . 
 Both in its lyrics and instruments , the song mixes traditional Chinese styles with modern rock elements . In the lyrics , the speaker addresses a girl who is scorning him because he has nothing . However , the song has also been interpreted as being about the dispossessed youth of the time , because it evokes a sense of disillusionment and lack of individual freedom that was common among the young generation during the 1980s . 
 = = Historical context = = 
 By the late 1970s , Western rock music was gaining popularity in mainland China . After the Cultural Revolution ended in the mid @-@ 1970s and the government began a period of economic reform called <unk> <unk> , many students and businessmen went abroad and brought back Western music . Chinese singers began performing covers of popular Western rock songs . 
 At the same time , Chinese society and the Chinese government were quickly abandoning Maoism , and promoting economic policies that had a more capitalist orientation . Many Chinese teens and students were becoming disillusioned with their government , which they felt had abandoned its ideals . Because of the rapid economic changes , many of them felt that they had no opportunities and no individual freedom . These developments formed the background against which " Nothing to My Name " appeared in 1986 . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 = = = Musical style = = = 
 Cui Jian was heavily influenced by Western artists such as Bob Dylan , The Beatles , The Rolling Stones , and Talking Heads ; in the late 1980s he even performed with a hair style modeled on that of John Lennon . In " Nothing to My Name " and other songs , he intentionally altered the sounds of traditional Chinese musical instruments by mixing them with elements of rock music , such as electric guitar . He also purposely divorced his musical style from that of the revolutionary songs and proletarian operas that were common under Chairman Mao Zedong during the Cultural Revolution — for example , he performed his music very loud , as high as 150 decibels , just because Mao had considered loud music disruptive to the social order . 
 In genre , the song is often called the first work of <unk> , a 1980s music style originating from Northwest China . Cui himself , however , considers the song " pure " rock and roll . 
 = = = Lyrics and meaning = = = 
 Throughout the song , the narrator addresses an unidentified girl , asking " When will you come with me " , and lamenting the fact that she laughs at him for having nothing to his name . He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom , that " the earth is turning under your feet " and " the waters of life are flowing free " , yet she persists in scorning him . He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back , and he wonders why he keeps on going , with nothing to his name . At last , he tells her that he has waited for a long time , and that this is his final plea : he wants to grab her by the hands , to " take you away with me " . As he sees her hands tremble , and her eyes " overflow with tears " , he asks her , " Do you really mean to tell me , you love me as I am ? " 
 Interpretations of the song 's meaning vary from one listener to the next ; some people view it as a song about love and desire , while others understand it as a political metaphor , the lyrics being addressed as much to the Chinese nation as to a girlfriend . University of Florida scholar Jonathan <unk> describes the song 's lyrics as a means of expressing politically sensitive ideas that could not be stated through any other medium . In this interpretation , the lyrics near the beginning , " I 've asked you without end / When will you go with me / But you always laughed at me / for having nothing to my name " ( " <unk> / <unk> / <unk> / <unk> " ) are taken to express the " humiliation and lack of individuality , possession , and personal freedom " , the " sense of loss and disorientation " among China 's youth in the 1980s . Ethnomusicologist Timothy Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as " recast [ ing ] the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole . " The ambiguity is heightened by the structure of the phrase yī <unk> <unk> <unk> , an idiomatic <unk> . It literally means " to have nothing " and has no grammatical subject . Therefore , it can be interpreted as meaning " I have nothing " ( implying that it is a song about two people ) , or " we have nothing " ( understanding it as social commentary ) . 
 The narrator of the song worries that the girl he is addressing will ignore him because he has nothing to give her ; likewise , the song 's audience in the 1980s — young students and workers — were also suffering from not having resources to marry , to be with their girlfriends and boyfriends , or to attract members of the opposite sex . The lyrics also express Western concepts of individualism , and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to promote self @-@ expression and self @-@ empowerment . This put the song in stark contrast with older music , which had emphasized conformity and obedience . As the narrator , later on in the song , confidently proclaims to the girl that he will " grab her hands " ( " <unk> " ) and then she will go with him ( " <unk> " ) , he suggests in the end that she can love the fact that he has nothing ( " <unk> / <unk> " ) . On one level , this suggests that the song is about " love conquering all " , but the line has also been interpreted as threatening , and suggestive of an unorthodox and " Dionysian " mix of love and aggression . 
 Just as Cui adapts traditional Chinese sounds and instruments to a new format , in " Nothing to My Name " he also reappropriates traditional Chinese lyrical tropes . The lines " The earth under your feet is moving / The water around your body is flowing " ( " <unk> / <unk> " ) are reminiscent of the use of natural imagery in classical Chinese poetry and music , but here are intended to evoke the events going on around the song 's listeners , and to provoke them to rebel against the established order . 
 = = Release and impact = = 
 Cui wrote " Nothing to My Name " himself and first performed it on a televised music competition in May 1986 , with his band ADO . The song was an instant success , creating a " sensation " and turning Cui into a cult figure among urban youth . It was one of the first examples of Chinese , as opposed to imported , rock and roll music to gain popularity in China . The government @-@ controlled People 's Daily gave the song a positive review , despite its politically sensitive message . The song was included on Cui 's 1989 album Rock ' n ' Roll on the New Long March , released by the China Tourism Sound and Video Publishing Company . ( The version of the album released overseas was called Nothing to My Name . ) By 1989 , it had become a " battle song " or " anthem " among the youth movement . 
 Cui performed the song live at the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 . The performances by Cui and other rock artists during the protests have been described as " a revolutionary few days that rocked a nation , " and many protesters sang " Nothing to My Name " to give voice to their rebellion against the government , and their desire for personal freedom and self @-@ expression . Brace describes how , during Cui 's Tiananmen performance , students " jumped to their feet and began to sing , " a practice that had rarely happened at music performances in China before then . Not long after Tiananmen , Cui was restricted to playing in small venues ; he did not play before a large audience in Beijing again until 2005 . 
 Cui has become known as the " Father of Chinese Rock " , and " Nothing to My Name " has become his most famous song . It has been described as " the biggest hit in Chinese history " and the beginning of Chinese rock .

 = Adrian Monk = 
 Adrian Monk is a title character and the protagonist of the USA Network television series Monk , portrayed by Tony Shalhoub . He is a renowned former homicide detective for the San Francisco Police Department . Monk has obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder ( OCD ) and multiple phobias , all of which intensified after the murder of his wife Trudy , resulting in his suspension from the department . He works as a private police homicide consultant and undergoes therapy with the ultimate goal of overcoming his grief , taking control of his phobias and disorder , and being reinstated as a police detective . 
 Series co @-@ creator David Hoberman says that he based Monk partly on himself , and also on other fictional detectives , such as Lt. Columbo , Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes . Other actors considered for the role included Dave Foley , John Ritter , Henry Winkler , Stanley Tucci , Alfred Molina and Michael Richards . The network eventually chose Shalhoub because they felt he could " bring the humor and passion of Monk to life . " Stanley Tucci and Alfred Molina had guest appearances on Monk , with Tucci appearing in season 5 episode " Mr. Monk and the Actor " , and Molina appearing in season 6 episode " Mr. Monk and the Naked Man " . 
 Both Monk and Shalhoub have garnered many accolades . Monk was included in Bravo 's list of The 100 Greatest Television Characters of All Time , and Shalhoub has won various awards for his portrayal , including a Golden Globe Award , three Primetime Emmy Awards and two Screen Actors Guild Awards . 
 On The Best Show on August 18 , 2015 , former Monk executive producer Tom Scharpling confirmed that the character has died of " natural causes " since the ending of the show . 
 = = Character development = = 
 = = = Creation = = = 
 Monk was originally envisioned as a " more goofy and physical " Inspector Clouseau type of character . However , co @-@ creator David Hoberman came up with the idea of a detective with obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder . This was inspired by his own bout with self @-@ diagnosed obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder ; in a Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette interview , he stated that , " Like Monk , I couldn 't walk on cracks and had to touch poles . I have no idea why – but if I didn 't do these things , something terrible would happen . " 
 Other fictional inspirations include Columbo and Sherlock Holmes , and his obsession with neatness and order may be an homage to Hercule Poirot . Like Holmes , and occasionally Poirot , Monk is accompanied by an earnest assistant with little or no detective ability , similar to Doctor Watson and Captain Hastings , respectively ; Monk 's two major allies from the police department , Captain Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher ( credited as " Deacon " in the pilot episode ) , are reminiscent of Inspector Lestrade and Chief Inspector Japp , Holmes 's and Poirot 's well @-@ meaning but ineffectual respective police counterparts . In addition , Monk has a brother whose abilities of deduction are even more amazing than his , yet much more geographically limited due to his own personal problems , somewhat in the style of Mycroft Holmes ( who is more adept than Sherlock but also notoriously lazy ) . 
 When trying to think of a possible name for the character , co @-@ creator Andy Breckman decided to look for a " simple monosyllabic last name . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Co @-@ creator David Hoberman revealed that the casting sessions were " depressing " . USA Network 's executive vice president Jeff Wachtel stated that looking for the right actor to portray Monk was " casting hell " . After two years of developing , the producers still had not found an actor to play the part . Although Michael Richards was considered , distributors of the show ABC and Touchstone worried that the audience would typecast him for more comedic roles after his previous work as Cosmo Kramer on the sitcom series Seinfeld . After Richards dropped out of the project , he went on to star in another series about a private detective , The Michael Richards Show , which was canceled after six episodes . 
 = = Personality = = 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 In the script for the pilot , " Mr. Monk and the Candidate , " Monk is described as being " a modern day Sherlock Holmes " , only " nuts . " In the introductory scene of the episode , he is examining the scene of Nicole <unk> ' murder , and picks up several important clues , but frequently interrupts himself to wonder aloud whether he left his stove on when he left the house that morning . In the season 6 episode " Mr. Monk and the Daredevil " , Monk mentions that he has 312 phobias . The strongest of these phobias are : germs , dentists , sharp or pointed objects , milk , vomiting , death and dead things , snakes , crowds , heights , fear , mushrooms , and small spaces , as Monk also mentions in the season 2 episode " Mr. Monk and the Very Very Old Man " . In addition , new phobias develop at seemingly random intervals , such as a temporary fear of blankets at the end of the season 5 episode " Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink " . Though it is impossible to determine his strongest phobia , there does appear to be some form of hierarchy between them : in the series finale " Mr. Monk and the End " , it is made clear that his fear of vomiting is greater than his fear of death . He has also stated , " Snakes trump heights ! " . 
 Due to his overpowering fear of germs , Monk refuses to touch door handles and other common objects with his bare hands , avoids contact with anything dirty , and always uses sanitary wipes after human contact , including basic handshakes . He is also unable to eat food that other people have touched , as shown in the season 7 episode " Mr. Monk Falls in Love " when he and Leyla <unk> go out to a <unk> restaurant . 
 = = = Assistants = = = 
 Monk 's phobias and anxiety disorders make him depend on personal assistants , who drive him around , do his shopping , and always carry a supply of wipes for his use , as shown in episodes like " Mr. Monk Meets the Playboy " , " Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival " , etc . They also take an active role in organizing his consultancy work , and sometimes investigate cases themselves . His first assistant , Sharona Fleming ( Bitty Schram ) , is a single mother and practical nurse by profession , hired by the police department to help Monk recover from the three @-@ year catatonic state he lapsed into after Trudy 's death . After several years of loyal service , Sharona leaves the show in season 3 to return to New Jersey and remarry her ex @-@ husband Trevor . After her abrupt departure , Monk has a chance meeting with Natalie Teeger ( Traylor Howard ) , whom he hires as his new assistant starting in " Mr. Monk and the Red Herring " . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Monk carries out futile and endless attempts to make the world " balanced . " Monk is fixated with symmetry , going so far as to always cut his pancakes into squares . He strongly prefers familiarity and rigorous structure in his activities . Monk only drinks Sierra Springs water throughout seasons 1 – 5 and a fictional brand ( Summit Creek ) throughout seasons 6 – 8 , to the point that in the season 2 episode " Mr. Monk Goes to Mexico " , Monk goes without drinking for several days because he cannot find any Sierra Springs . Monk also has great difficulty in standard social situations , so much so that he must write down common small talk phrases on note cards in an attempt to successfully socialize . While his obsessive attention to minute detail cripples him socially , it makes him a gifted detective and profiler . He has a photographic memory , and can reconstruct entire crime scenes based on little more than scraps of detail that seem unimportant to his colleagues . His trademark method of examining a crime scene , which Sharona used to call his " Zen Sherlock Holmes thing , " is to wander seemingly aimlessly around a crime scene , occasionally holding up his hands , as though framing a shot for a photograph . Shalhoub explained in an interview that Monk does this because it " isolates and cuts the crime scene into slices " and causes Monk to look at parts of the crime scene instead of the whole . 
 Monk 's delicate mental condition means that his ability to function can be severely impaired by a variety of factors . One example is shown during the season 5 episode " Mr. Monk and the Garbage Strike " , in which the smell of garbage prevents Monk from being able to easily identify the murderer of sanitation union boss Jimmy Cusack . Another example : when entering a chaotic murder scene in the episode " Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale " , his first impulse is to straighten the lamps , though he is frequently able to hold off his fixations when examining bodies or collecting evidence . Even though Monk 's mental state in the series is said to be a result of his wife 's death , he shows signs of OCD in flashbacks dating back to childhood . To deal with his OCD and phobias , Monk visits a psychiatrist – Dr. Charles Kroger ( Stanley Kamel ) in the first six seasons and Dr. Neven Bell ( Héctor Elizondo ) in the last two seasons – weekly , and at several points , daily . 
 Over the course of the show ( roughly 8 years ) , Monk overcomes many of his phobias and some aspects of his OCD . Though he hasn 't been cured of many of them , if any at all , he has been able to put them in the back of his mind when involved in case work . His most notable breakthrough is shown in the season 8 episode " Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy " , when Adrian is locked in a car trunk with his fellow OCD patient and personal rival , Harold Krenshaw . During the terrifying trip , both men overcome their longstanding case of claustrophobia ( fear of small spaces ) , as well as their own differences , resulting in them becoming friends . Possibly due to this , as well as the many cases Monk has solved over the years , he is reinstated as detective first class by Stottlemeyer in the season 8 episode " Mr. Monk and the Badge " . Though he is very excited about his reinstatement initially , Monk realizes that becoming a detective again didn 't mean that he would be happier . In a session with Dr. Bell , Monk realizes he was always happy as a private detective and consultant to the SFPD as his own boss . After overcoming his fear of heights and singlehandedly capturing a killer window @-@ washer , Monk turns in his badge . In the series finale , he learns that his late wife , Trudy , had given birth to a daughter before they had met . The knowledge and events of the episode lead to positive changes in his personality .

 Monk is of Welsh ancestry and was born October 17 , 1959 . This is shown in the episode " Happy Birthday , Mr. Monk " , which takes place on a Wednesday of the week of October 16 , 2009 ( It is stated that his 50th birthday is the next day , which would be Thursday , October 17 , 2009 ) . Interestingly , this makes Monk almost exactly six years younger than his actor , as Tony Shalhoub 's birthday was October 9 , 1953 . 
 It is known he was born in the fictitious Marin County town of Tewksbury , to parents Agnes and Jack Monk , Sr. His parents were very strict and over @-@ protective . Adrian 's father , Jack Monk ( Dan Hedaya ) , abandoned the family when Adrian was eight years old when he went out for Chinese food and did not return . Adrian has an agoraphobic brother named Ambrose ( John Turturro ) , from whom he was estranged for seven years following Trudy 's death . Monk states that his mother died in 1994 . The episode " Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man " reveals that Monk ran track in high school , but quit when he entered college . The episode " Mr. Monk and the Other Detective " reveals that his alma mater is the University of California , Berkeley . In " Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion , " it is revealed that Monk had the nickname " Captain Cool " in college , and Natalie is amused to find that he got it from the fact he spent every weekend <unk> the student lounge refrigerator in his dormitory . 
 In the episode " Mr. Monk and the Three Pies , " it is revealed that Monk was angry at his brother for never contacting him after Trudy 's death . When the two are reunited , Ambrose admits he did not call Adrian because he believed that he was responsible for the incident . Trudy was getting Ambrose cough medicine and was in the store 's garage when she was killed . 
 Their father , Jack , remained unseen in the series until the season 5 episode " Mr. Monk Meets His Dad . " Jack explains that he did not return to his family because the message in his fortune cookie read " Stand by your man , " which he interpreted to mean that he should follow his own path . Adrian does not forgive his father at first , but warms up to him while assisting him on his duties as a truck driver . Jack mentions reading Sherlock Holmes stories to Adrian , who eventually learned to solve the mysteries before hearing the stories ' endings . At the end of the episode , Jack teaches Adrian how to ride a bike — something he was not there to do when Adrian was a child . Jack also mentioned that he has a son from another wife , named Jack Jr . ( Steve Zahn ) . Monk later meets Jack Jr. in the episode " Mr. Monk 's Other Brother " , and helps to clear him of murder . 
 = = = Trudy 's death = = = 
 Throughout the series , Adrian mourns his wife Trudy ( Melora Hardin / <unk> <unk> ) , who was killed by a car bomb he believes was meant for him on December 14 , 1997 . The death of his wife exacerbated Monk 's already existing obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . One year later , the San Francisco Police Department granted him a psychological discharge . Monk calls it " a temporary suspension " and hopes to be reinstated . His grief over Trudy 's death is intense and with him every day of his life ; he has stated more than once that he is never truly happy and never expects to be truly happy ever again . Since Trudy 's death , Monk has been consulting with San Francisco police detectives on various cases . 
 As the series progresses , Monk makes several discoveries in his ongoing search for the man who killed his wife . He discovered that the car bomb was indeed meant for Trudy and was built by a man named Warrick Tennyson ( Frank Collison ) , who was hired by a six @-@ fingered man named Frank Nunn ( Courtney Gains ) . In the sixth @-@ season finale , he finally catches up with Nunn , who claims to be yet another pawn with no idea why Trudy was killed . This turns out to be part of a larger plot to have Nunn set up another bombing and then frame Monk for killing him ; he is shot before Monk can have him arrested or convince him to surrender the name of his employer in Trudy 's murder . Once Monk is cleared in Nunn 's death , the police find correspondence from Nunn dating back to the era of Trudy 's death . There are no names discovered , but there is a reference to the person responsible , referred to as " The Judge " . In the two @-@ part series finale , " Mr. Monk and the End " , it is revealed that " The Judge " is Ethan Rickover , an actual courtroom judge portrayed by Craig T. Nelson . 
 Trudy gave birth to a daughter , Molly Evans , on January 2 , 1983 . Had she not been adopted out and Trudy not murdered , this would technically make Adrian Molly 's stepfather .

 Critical reviews of character Adrian Monk have been positive . Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times called Monk " TV 's most original sleuth ever " .

Monk is ranked number 99 on Bravo 's list of The 100 Greatest Television Characters of All Time . He was named one of TV 's Smartest Detectives by AOL . 
 Shalhoub 's performance in the series has also been praised . Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly called Shalhoub 's performance " original and splendid " . Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker said that Shalhoub is " brilliant at conveying the tension between Monk ’ s desire to conquer his disorder and his dug @-@ in defense of his behavior " . Michael Abernethy of PopMatters describes Shalhoub 's performance as " exceptional " , and Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer states that Shalhoub is a " careful and nuanced actor " .

 III Corps is a corps of the United States Army headquartered at Fort Hood , Texas . It is a major formation of the United States Army Forces Command . 
 Activated in World War I in France , III Corps oversaw US Army divisions as they repelled several major German offensives and led them into Germany . The corps was deactivated following the end of the war . 
 Reactivated in the interwar years , III Corps trained US Army formations for combat before and during World War II , before itself being deployed to the European Theater where it participated in several key engagements , including the Battle of the Bulge where it relieved the surrounded 101st Airborne Division . 
 For the next 50 years , the corps was a key training element for the US Army as it sent troops overseas in support of the Cold War , the Korean War , and the Vietnam War . The corps saw no combat deployments , however , until Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004 .

 In July , the corps was rushed to the Villers @-@ <unk> area in preparation for the Third Battle of the Aisne , the first major Allied counteroffensive of the year . There , it was put under the French Tenth Army and given administrative command of the 1st Division and the 2nd Division which were previously under command of the French XX Corps . However , the command group arrived in the area too late to exercise tactical command , and it was instead attached to the French XX Corps . On 18 July , the attack was launched , with the force spearheading the French Tenth Army 's assault on the high ground south of Soissons . During this attack , the Corps also cut rail lines supplying the German Army . 
 The first day of the attack was a success , but on the second day , the Germans were reinforced with heavier weapons and were able to blunt the attack , inflicting high casualties . The force was successful despite heavy casualties , and German forces were forced to retreat . On 1 August , the corps arrived in the <unk> area near the Marne River , where it assumed command of the 3rd Division , 28th Division , and 32nd Division from the French XXXVIII Corps , placing side @-@ by side with the U.S. I Corps for a few days .

The offensive was slow and hampered by inexperience of many of the divisions under the Army 's command , though III Corps was effective in protecting its sector . They advanced through September and October , taking a few weeks for rest after the formation of Second United States Army . On 1 November , the First Army went on a general offensive , pushing north to the Meuse River and the <unk> Ridge . It was successful , pushing German forces back and advancing to the river until the end of the war . Around that time , the division received its shoulder sleeve insignia , approving it by telegram , though the insignia would not be officially authorized until 1922 . 
 The corps was demobilized in Neuwied , Germany at the close of hostilities . Following the end of World War I , III Corps remained in Europe for several months before it returned to the United States . It was demobilized at Camp Sherman , Ohio .

 On 15 August 1927 the XXII Corps was activated in the United States . On 13 October of that year XXII Corps was redesignated as III Corps . It was formally activated on 18 December 1927 . Throughout much of the next decade , the corps was directed primarily with training and equipping smaller units , as the US military began slowly building in strength in response to international conflicts . In 1940 , III Corps was tasked specifically with training newly formed US Army combat divisions in preparation for deployment . It was moved to Camp Hood , Texas for this mission .

 The corps was moved to Fort McPherson , Georgia in early 1942 for training . After a short period , the corps returned to Monterey and on 19 August 1942 , it was designated a separate corps , capable of deployment . During the next two years , III Corps would train thousands of troops for combat , including 33 division @-@ sized units , and participate in four corps @-@ level maneuvers , including the Louisiana Maneuvers .

 On 23 August 1944 , the corps headquarters departed California for Camp Myles Standish in Massachusetts . It deployed for the European Theater of Operations on 5 September 1944 . Upon arrival at Cherbourg , France , the corps was assigned to the Ninth Army , Twelfth United States Army Group , and given the code name " CENTURY " which it retained throughout the war . The corps headquarters was established at Carteret , in Normandy , and for six weeks , the corps received and processed all the troops of the 12th Army Group arriving over the Normandy beaches during that period . The corps also participated in the " Red Ball Express " by organizing 45 provisional truck companies to carry fuel and ammunition for the units on the front lines . 
 The corps was assigned to the Third United States Army on 10 October 1944 , and moved to <unk> , near Verdun , and into combat . The corps ' first fighting was for the Metz region , as it was moved to attack Fort Jeanne d 'Arc , one of the last forts holding out in the region . That fort fell on 13 December 1944 . 
 Later that month on 16 December came the last German counteroffensive in the Battle of the Bulge , as over 250 @,@ 000 German troops , supported by over 1 @,@ 000 tanks and assault guns assaulted the lines of VIII Corps , some 40 miles to the north of III Corps . The next day , Third Army commander General George S. Patton warned III Corps that it would likely be ordered to assist . At that time the corps consisted of the 26th Infantry Division , 80th Infantry Division and the 4th Armored Division . III Corps was moved north to assist in the relief of Bastogne , with the attack commencing at 0400 on 22 December . The corps advanced north , catching the German forces by surprise on their south flank , cutting them off . The 4th Armored Division was eventually able to reach Bastogne , where the 101st Airborne Division had been surrounded by German forces , and relieve it . During the first 10 days of this action , III Corps liberated more than 100 towns , including Bastogne . This operation was key in halting the German offensive and the eventual drive to the Rhine River . 
 During the first four months of 1945 , III Corps moved quickly to the offensive . On 25 February , the corps , now as part of the First United States Army , established a bridgehead over the Roer River , which , in turn , led to the capture of the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen , on the Rhine River , on 7 March . On 30 March , the <unk> Dam was captured intact by Task Force Wolfe of the 7th Armored Division , and the corps continued the attack to seize the Ruhr Pocket on 5 April 1945 . In late April , III Corps reformed and launched a drive through Bavaria towards Austria . On 2 May 1945 , III Corps was ordered to halt at the Inn River on the Austrian border , just days before V @-@ E Day , when the German forces surrendered , bringing an end to the war in Europe . 
 = = = = Post @-@ war = = = = 
 At the end of the war , III Corps had added campaign streamers for Northern France , Rhineland , Ardennes @-@ Alsace , and Central Europe , had taken more than 226 @,@ 102 prisoners and had seized more than 4 @,@ 500 square miles ( 12 @,@ 000 km2 ) of German territory . The corps had also participated in most of the critical actions from Normandy to the German @-@ Austrian border . Its wartime commanders included Major General John Millikin and Major General James A. Van Fleet . After 13 months of occupation duty in Germany , the corps returned to Camp Polk , Louisiana , where it was inactivated on 10 October 1946 .

 On 15 March 1951 , during the height of the Korean War , III Corps was again called to active duty at Camp Roberts , California . In April 1954 , III Corps moved to Fort Hood , Texas , where it participated in a number of important exercises , either as director headquarters or as a player unit . It took command of the 1st Armored Division and the 4th Armored Division . The main purpose of these operations was the testing of new doctrines , organizations , and equipment . On 5 May 1959 , the corps was again inactivated . 
 The Berlin crisis brought III Corps back to active duty for the fourth time on 1 September 1961 . Units participated in an intensive training program and were operationally ready by December 1961 . In February 1962 , the Department of the Army designated III Corps as a unit of the U.S. Strategic Army Corps and in September 1965 , assigned III Corps to the U.S. Strategic Army Forces . Throughout much of the 1960s , III Corps and its subordinate units trained for rapid deployment to Europe in the event of an outbreak of war there . 
 During the Vietnam War era , the corps supervised the training and deployment of more than 137 units and detachments to Southeast Asia , including the I and II Field Force staffs . The corps also trained more than 40 @,@ 000 individual replacements for units in Vietnam , for a total of over 100 @,@ 000 soldiers trained . As the war in Southeast Asia ended , the corps received many units and individual soldiers for reassignment or inactivation . It was also during this period that III Corps units participated in a number of key tests and evaluations that would help determine Army organization and equipment for the next 30 years . During this era , the corps also received its distinctive unit insignia . 
 In July 1973 , III Corps became part of the newly established Forces Command and its training , testing , and evaluation mission began to grow . For the remainder of the decade , III Corps would take part in a number of Training and Doctrine Command tests of organizations and tactical concepts , and play a key role in the fielding of new equipment . III Corps units would also participate in major exercises such as Exercise <unk> ( Return of Forces to Germany ) and disaster relief operations in the United States and Central America . 
 In the summer of 1974 , the Army decided to implement one of the recommendations of the Howze Board and created an air cavalry combat brigade . The assets of the 2d Brigade , 1st Cavalry Division were used to create the 6th Cavalry Brigade ( Air Combat ) . The new brigade was assigned to the III Corps as a corps asset . 1st Squadron , 6th Cavalry Regiment , was transferred to the new brigade on 21 February 1975 . The brigade served as a test bed for new concepts involving the employment of attack helicopters on the modern battlefield . In 1985 @-@ 85 , the brigade consisted of 1st Squadron , 6th Cavalry ; 4th Squadron , 9th Cavalry Regiment ( 4 @-@ 9 CAV ) ; and 5th and 7th Squadrons , 17th Cavalry Regiment ( 5 @-@ 17 CAV and 7 @-@ 17 CAV ) , all flying attack helicopters . 
 As part of the Army 's modernization effort in the 1980s corps units introduced new organizations and equipment including the M1 Abrams tank , M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle , AH @-@ 64 Apache helicopter , Multiple Launch Rocket System , and Mobile Subscriber Equipment . In 1987 , III Corps also conducted the largest deployment of forces to Germany since the Second World War , Exercise <unk> ' 87 . During this time , the corps began assisting in the training and support of active and reserve component units . This support involves training guidance , resources , and the maintenance of relationships that extend to wartime affiliations .

 Following the end of the Cold War , III Corps headquarters itself saw no major contingencies , however it saw numerous units under its command deploy to contingencies around the world . III Corps units were sent to Grenada , Panama , Honduras , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and Iraq . In the fall of 1990 , two 6th Cavalry Brigade ( Air Combat ) units deployed to Iraq during Operation Desert Shield . One of those units was 2nd Battalion , 158th Aviation Regiment , a Chinook battalion from Fort Hood . Other corps units also provided humanitarian support for Operation Restore Hope in Somalia . III Corps elements supported Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well . 
 It was after the Cold War that III Corps was acclimated to the role of primary counteroffensive force for the US Army . With the downsizing of other major Army formations , III Corps gained command of heavier units , including the 1st Cavalry Division while the XVIII Airborne Corps took charge of rapid @-@ deployment for emergency contingencies , including the 101st Airborne Division and 82nd Airborne Division . III Corps took charge of the heavy units designed for large , conventional offensive actions . 
 = = = Twenty @-@ first century = = = 
 In 2001 , the corps was composed of the 1st Cavalry Division and the 4th Infantry Division as well as the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 13th Corps Support Command . However , with realignment of the US Army and the return of several formations from Europe , the corps took command of the 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Armored Division as well , both of these units having been transferred from V Corps in Germany . 
 The corps headquarters saw its first combat deployment since the Second World War in 2004 , when it deployed to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom . There , III Corps headquarters assumed duties as Headquarters Multi @-@ National Corps - Iraq , relieving V Corps . III Corps served as the administrative command for 2 @,@ 500 soldiers of the Multi @-@ National Force Iraq command element , providing operational direction into 2005 , when it was returned to Fort Hood , relieved by XVIII Airborne Corps . III Corps has for many years participated in an exchange program which sees a Canadian Army officer appointed as a deputy commanding general . Notably , Peter Devlin deployed with the corps to Iraq in 2005 . 
 III Corps Artillery was inactivated on 8 September 2006 . Henceforth the field artillery brigades , soon to become Fires Brigades , would be assigned to the corps and division headquarters directly . 
 In 2007 , the corps returned to Iraq for a second time to serve as commanding headquarters for Multi @-@ National Corps Iraq . During this 15 @-@ month deployment , the corps took command of the force at its largest with Iraq War troop surge . The corps conducted a similar mission to its first deployment , focusing on providing personnel management , training , communications , convoy escort , and other duties to support the commanding elements of Multi @-@ National Force Iraq . III Corps fulfilled this mission until February 2008 , when it returned home , again relieved by XVIII Airborne Corps . 
 In 2009 , the corps began a number of training initiatives with the Republic of Korea Army . These included Operation Key Resolve , a command post exercise simulating major , high intensity combat operations . The exercises were held in <unk> , South Korea . These operations were designed to keep the corps familiar with commanding during large @-@ scale conventional warfare , as opposed to counter @-@ insurgency tactics it employed during its two tours in Iraq . Upon return to the United States , the corps conducted similar exercises at Fort Hood . 
 On 5 November 2009 , a gunman opened fire in the Soldier Readiness Center of Fort Hood , killing 13 people and wounding 30 others . Nidal Malik Hasan , a Muslim U.S. Army major and psychiatrist , was alleged to be the gunman . He was felled and then arrested by civilian police officers Sergeant Mark Todd & Sergeant Kimberly <unk> . Much of the subsequent investigation was handled by III Corps , as the soldiers killed were under the corps ' chain of command . 
 III Corps , commanded by LTG Robert W. Cone , assumed its final Iraq mission from I Corps from Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord , Washington in February 2010 . As the core element of United States Forces – Iraq headquarters , III Corps oversaw a theater @-@ wide transition from full @-@ spectrum operations to stability operations . The corps changed the counterinsurgency ( <unk> ) fight dynamic from partnered combat operations , led by brigade combat teams , to training , advising , and assisting operations , led by brigades organized as advise and assist brigades . The corps also completed the transition to complete Iraqi lead for security operations . During the deployment , III Corps reduced the amount of aviation assets in Iraq , resulting in one enhanced combat aviation brigade with six maneuver battalions having responsibility for the entire joint operations area . III Corps also oversaw the reduction of the force in Iraq from 110 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 U.S. personnel by Sept . 1 , 2010 , which established the conditions for the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the transition to Operation New Dawn . XVIII Airborne Corps from Fort Bragg , North Carolina , assumed the Iraq follow @-@ on mission from III Corps in February 2011 . 
 The corps saw its first action in Afghanistan when it deployed to Kabul in early April 2013 . The corps , under the command of LTG Mark A. <unk> , replaced the U.S. V Corps from Stuttgart , Germany , in May 2013 and assumed the mission of the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) Joint Command , or IJC , which was responsible for day @-@ to @-@ day operations throughout Afghanistan . During the corps ' deployment , IJC oversaw Milestone 13 / Tranche 5 ceremony on June 18 , 2013 , which marked the official transition of full responsibility for nationwide security operations from ISAF to the Afghan National Security Forces ( ANSF ) . After the Milestone 13 ceremony , IJC transitioned from Coalition @-@ led combat operations to Afghan @-@ led combat operations and Coalition forces providing training , advice , and assistance . The ANSF , officially less than three years old , reached its peak of more than 350 @,@ 000 members and conducted more than 70 major operations in more than 22 provinces . In November 2013 , IJC forces provided technical support to the ANSF as it secured the Loya Jirga , a country @-@ wide gathering of Afghan local leaders and officials , in Kabul . The Loya Jirga successfully laid the groundwork for a <unk> Bilateral Security Agreement . During the deployment , III Corps also oversaw the drawdown of U.S. forces from more than 80 @,@ 000 to 34 @,@ 000 by Feb. 1 , 2014 . XVIII Airborne Corps from Fort Bragg , North Carolina , assumed the ISAF Joint Command mission from III Corps in March 2014 ..

 Texas vs. Ohio State football game , played September 10 , 2005 , was the first @-@ ever meeting between The University of Texas at Austin and The Ohio State University in a college football game . The two teams came into the game ranked No. 2 and No. 4 , respectively . It was the second game of the 2005 season for both teams . Schools have become increasingly conservative in scheduling non @-@ conference opponents of a high caliber , so a meeting of two top @-@ five teams in the country was unusual this early in the season . For either team , winning the game would boost their chances of ultimately playing in the BCS National Championship Game while the loser likely faced the end of their national championship hopes . 
 According to observers such as USA Today , the game between the Texas Longhorns and Ohio State Buckeyes was one of the most @-@ anticipated games of the 2005 season . Due to the high level of anticipation , ESPN chose the game for the location of its weekly College GameDay broadcast . 
 The 2005 Texas Longhorn football team ( variously " Texas " or " UT " or the " Horns " ) was coached by head football coach Mack Brown and led on the field by quarterback Vince Young . The 2005 Ohio State Buckeyes football team ( variously " Ohio State " or " OSU " or the " Bucks " ) was coached by Jim Tressel . Justin Zwick and Troy Smith shared time as quarterback due to disciplinary measures enforced against Smith . The game was a back @-@ and @-@ forth affair which was ultimately won by Texas , 25 – 22 . The game 's attendance was 105 @,@ 565 , which set the then all @-@ time attendance record for Ohio Stadium . The game was televised nationally on ABC and drew 9 @.@ 9 million viewers . 
 ESPN and College Football Rivals , were among the observers who named the game one of the best football games of the season . Texas ' win kept them near the front of the national championship picture . They ultimately finished the season unbeaten , snaring the Big 12 Conference and NCAA championships . Ohio State finished the season with ten wins and two losses and ranked No. 4 in the nation . 
 = = Leading into the 2005 season = = 
 The Ohio State Buckeyes and Texas Longhorns are two of the most storied programs in college football . Before 2005 each school had participated in college football for more than 100 years . They are home to nationally known traditions from the Buckeye leaf stickers and the O @-@ H @-@ I @-@ O chant at Ohio State to Bevo and the Hook ' em Horns of Texas . 
 One of the three most victorious programs in college football history as judged by either number of wins or winning percentage , the University of Texas has traditionally been considered a college football powerhouse . From 1936 to 2004 , the team finished the season in the top ten 23 times , or one @-@ third of the time , according to the Associated Press . The team that coach Mack Brown fielded in 2005 has been called one of the most memorable in college football history by College Football News . 
 Like the Longhorns , the Buckeyes are an elite football program . The Buckeyes program has produced 164 first @-@ team All @-@ American players , including seven Heisman Trophy winners . 
 The 2005 UT team was attempting to follow on the success of the 2004 season , in which quarterback Vince Young led the team to Mack Brown 's first Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) game in the 2005 Rose Bowl and a top @-@ 5 finish in the polls . With the exception of Cedric Benson , Derrick Johnson , and Bo Scaife , Texas returned most of their key players from 2004 – 2005 , including redshirt junior quarterback Vince Young . 
 Texas was given a pre @-@ season No. 2 ranking ( behind defending National Champions University of Southern California ) by Sports Illustrated magazine and was also ranked second in the pre @-@ season Associated Press Poll and USA Today Coaches Poll . This created anticipation that Texas might play for the national championship if they could win their road game against Ohio State University and if they could snap their five @-@ game losing streak against the Oklahoma Sooners who started the season ranked at No. 7 . 
 Ohio State had similarly high pre @-@ season expectations with their No. 4 ranking . There was preseason speculation they might win the Big Ten Conference and possibly even to have a chance at the national championship . The team featured a " dynamic duo " of wide receivers in Ted Ginn , Jr. and Santonio Holmes . Holmes entered his junior year as the No. 1 receiver for the Buckeyes after catching a pass in every game he played during the 2004 season ; he finished the season with 769 yards and seven touchdowns on 55 catches . Ginn was known for his explosive plays and versatility . For instance in the 2004 game against the Michigan State Spartans , he scored three touchdowns ( one rushing , one receiving , and one punt return ) . 
 For either team to play in the national title game , that team had to end up ranked No. 1 or No. 2 at the end of the regular season . Since the Bowl Championship Series was formed in 1998 , 9 of the 14 teams were unbeaten going into the championship game . The only time the national champion has not been unbeaten during that stretch was in 2003 when LSU and USC claimed a share of the title as each finished with one loss . Ohio State tackle Kirk Barton would later say " There ’ ll probably be two undefeated teams at the end of the road and if you ’ re not one of them you ’ re probably not going to be playing for the championship . So you ’ ve got to treat every game like it ’ s the Super Bowl . You only get one opportunity . " 
 = = Prior to the game = = 
 After they each won their home opener , Texas and Ohio State came into the game still ranked No. 2 and No. 4 , respectively . According to observers such as USA Today , the match @-@ up between the Longhorns and the OSU Buckeyes was one of the most @-@ anticipated games of the 2005 season . Teams have become increasingly conservative in scheduling non @-@ conference opponents of a high caliber , so a meeting of the number 2 and number 4 teams in the country is unusual this early in the season . Due to the high level of anticipation , ESPN chose the game for the location of its weekly College GameDay broadcast . 
 This meeting was also the first @-@ ever match @-@ up between the two storied programs ; the two teams had combined to play 1 @,@ 594 games before meeting . For Texas , it also meant playing a second Big Ten Conference powerhouse soon after winning the first @-@ ever matchup between Texas and the University of Michigan at the end of the 2004 season . 
 The Buckeyes entered the game with an all @-@ time record of 766 – 298 – 53 including an Ohio Stadium mark of 356 – 101 – 20 . During the 115 years the school has played football , the Buckeyes had won seven national championships , the most recent being in 2002 when they finished with a perfect 14 – 0 record . Texas came into the game with an all @-@ time record of 788 – 310 – 33 since 1893 . The Longhorns victory total and victory percentage are both the third highest in the NCAA annals . The Longhorns had won three national championships , most recently in 1970 . OSU ranked sixth all @-@ time winning percentage and was tied with Alabama for fifth in terms of total victories . 
 Before the game , it had been uncertain who would play at quarterback for Ohio State . Justin Zwick had started for OSU in the 2004 season but three straight loses and an injury to Zwick gave Troy Smith a chance to start . However , an NCAA investigation found Smith took $ 500 from an Ohio State booster in violation of NCAA rules . Although he could have been dismissed from the team , ultimately he had to repay the money and was forced to sit out OSU 's 2004 bowl game and the first game of 2005 . Ohio State coach Jim Tressel announced ahead of time that both Zwick and Smith would play in the game . 
 The game was played at Ohio State University in Ohio Stadium , also known as " The Horseshoe " or " the Shoe " . This stadium is notoriously tough for visiting teams , as its large capacity and structural design create a tremendous amount of crowd noise that can make it difficult for the visiting team to call audibles at the line of scrimmage . The Buckeyes had an active 36 consecutive game non @-@ conference winning streak in the stadium . The game 's attendance was 105 @,@ 565 , which set the all @-@ time attendance record for Ohio Stadium . The game was televised nationally on ABC and drew 9 @.@ 9 million viewers .

 The Buckeyes got the ball to start the game and Justin Zwick was the starting quarterback . He led his team to advance only five yards in three plays so they punted from their own 46 yard @-@ line to the UT eleven yard @-@ line . Less than five minutes into the game , Texas scored first on a field goal by David Pino . The 42 @-@ yard kick was a career @-@ long for Pino and also the first of what would be a career @-@ high ( single game ) three field goals . Ohio State strung together 11 plays for 64 yards but had to punt . With 1 : 37 to play in the first quarter , Texas extended this lead to 10 – 0 with a five @-@ yard touchdown pass from Vince Young to Billy Pittman . Troy Smith came into the game for the first time and was still leading the Buckeyes at the end of the first quarter .

 Ohio State controlled most of the second quarter . Their first score was a 45 @-@ yd field goal by Josh Huston followed by a 36 @-@ yard touchdown pass from Troy Smith to Santonio Holmes to tie the score at 10 – 10 . They took the lead with two more field goals from Josh Huston ; the first was from 36 yards and the second was from 25 yards . Following the kick @-@ off , Texas took possession of the ball at their own 31 yard @-@ line with only 31 seconds remaining in the first half . Young began the drive by throwing a 36 @-@ yard pass to the Ohio State 18 yard @-@ line and then the receiver ran out of bounds to stop the clock with 20 seconds to play . On the next play , Young rushed for six yards and was tackled in @-@ bounds , causing Texas to use a time out with 12 seconds on the clock . On second down , OSU 's A.J. Hawk sacked Vince Young for a loss of 8 yards , forcing Texas to take another time @-@ out with seven seconds remaining . Texas put in David Pino to complete a 37 yard kick with two seconds left , making the score 16 – 13 in favor of Ohio State . Texas kicked off and time expired on the ensuing 18 @-@ yard return by Erick Jackson .

 Texas got the ball at their 20 to start the second half . On the first play from scrimmage , Jamaal Charles rushed for three yards . On second down , Vince Young 's pass was intercepted by Nate Salley at the UT 37 . Two rushes by Antonio Pittman resulted in a first down at the UT 30 . After a short gain on first down and an incomplete pass on second down , Troy Smith recovered his own fumble on third down to set up a successful 44 @-@ yard field goal by Huston . Texas used six plays , including a 63 @-@ yard pass to Billy Pittman before being stopped at the Ohio State eight yard @-@ line . David Pino made the 25 @-@ yard field goal . On the ensuing kick @-@ off by Richmond McGee , OSU 's Ted Ginn , Jr. took the ball at the one yard @-@ line and ran it out to almost mid @-@ field . The drive ended with a successful 26 @-@ yard field goal by Huston . The following three possessions ( two for Texas and one for Ohio State ) resulted in punts . The third quarter expired with Ohio State leading 22 to 16 and with control of the ball near mid @-@ field .

 Ohio State was unable to score and gave the ball back to Texas with 13 : 24 left in the game . Texas was forced to punt . On the Buckeyes ' next possession they drove from their own 30 to the Texas 33 before settling for a sixth field goal attempt by Huston , this one from 50 yards out . Huston missed wide left to leave Ohio State still ahead by six points . Texas took over at their own 33 with 5 : 07 left in the game . 
 On an incomplete pass to Brian Carter , Texas benefited from a pass interference penalty which moved the ball to the UT 48 . Vince Young rushed for four yards and then threw an incomplete pass to Ramonce Taylor before taking a timeout with 4 : 42 left to play . Young 's next pass was complete for a first down to Jamaal Charles who went out @-@ of @-@ bounds to completely stop the clock . Vince Young rushed for one yard to the OSU 38 and then took a time @-@ out at 3 : 53 . Young threw to Jamaal Charles who gained eight yards and went out @-@ of @-@ bounds . An offsides penalty by Ohio State and a one @-@ yard rush by Jamaal Charles gave Texas second and nine from the Ohio State 24 . On second and nine with 2 : 37 remaining to play , Vince Young passed a touchdown pass over the head of a defender to find Limas Sweed in the end @-@ zone . It was the 23rd touchdown pass by Young , putting him seventh in the all @-@ time school record book . David Pino 's kick gave Texas the lead at 23 – 22 . 
 Texas kicked off to the Ohio State five yard @-@ line and Holmes returned it 26 yards to the Buckeye 31 . Justin Zwick was in at quarterback for Ohio State . On first @-@ and @-@ ten and needing a score to win the game , Zwick rushed around the left side to the 35 but a fumble was forced by UT 's Drew Kelson . UT 's Brian Robison recovered the fumble at the 30 and advanced it nine yards before being tackled by Vernon Gholston at the Ohio State 21 . 
 With 2 : 19 to play and nursing a one @-@ point lead , Texas was in position to win if they could run out the clock . They began with a 12 @-@ yard rush on the left side by Jamaal Charles for a first down . Charles then carried again up the middle for a two @-@ yard gain to the Ohio State 7 . OSU called a time @-@ out to stop the clock at 1 : 36 . On second @-@ and @-@ goal , Vince Young kept the ball and gained three yards before being tackled by A.J. Hawk . The Buckeyes again called time @-@ out with 1 : 23 left . Young carried again for three yards before being brought down by B. Carpenter and A.J. Hawk just one yard short of the goal @-@ line . This time , Texas took a time @-@ out with 29 seconds left to play . Following the time @-@ out , Young handed off to Henry Melton who was stopped for no gain . Ohio State took over on downs . 
 Troy Smith came back in as quarterback for Ohio State . On first down , Smith was sacked for a loss of one yard by Aaron Harris . This gave Texas a safety , extending their lead to 25 – 22 . Josh Huston attempted an onside kick , but Texas was able to recover it at the Ohio State 32 . Texas took a knee to end the game . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 Ohio State recovered three turnovers in Texas territory , but each time the Texas defense held OSU to just a field goal . The five field goals by Josh Huston tied an Ohio State school and stadium record . He now shares the record with Mike Nugent ( at North Carolina State , September 19 , 2004 ) and Bob <unk> ( vs. Indiana , October 24 , 1981 in Ohio Stadium ) . Wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr . , usually an important contributor for the Buckeyes , was held to only nine yards receiving but he also contributed 82 yards on three kick @-@ off returns ( the longest was for 46 yards ) and eight yards on one punt return . 
 Texas ' win at 25 – 22 was the lowest scoring game the team would experience all season , both in terms of points scored by Texas and in terms of total points . UT 's victory against fourth @-@ ranked OSU marked the highest ranked non @-@ conference opponent the Longhorns had ever beaten at the opponent 's home stadium . The previous high came in 1983 when third @-@ ranked Texas pulled off a 20 – 7 upset at fifth @-@ ranked Auburn . Texas became the first non @-@ conference opponent to beat The Buckeyes in Ohio Stadium since 1990 , putting an end to a 36 @-@ game home victory string over non @-@ conference opponents . The Longhorns also were the first team to ever beat the Buckeyes in a night game at The Horseshoe . It was UT 's 10th straight victory in a night game road contest . ESPN and College Football Rivals , were among the observers who named the game one of the best football games of the season . 
 = = After the game = = 
 Texas eventually finished the season of 2005 – 2006 as the only undefeated team , winning both the Big 12 Conference championship and the National Championship . The Longhorns ' penultimate victory of the season , in the Big 12 Championship Game , featured the biggest margin of victory in the history of that contest . Their ultimate victory in the 2006 Rose Bowl against the University of Southern California Trojans for the national championship , as well as their overall season , have both been cited as standing among the greatest performances in college football history by publications such as College Football News , the Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution , Scout.com , and Sports Illustrated .

 = Bedsitcom = 
 Bedsitcom is a British reality television hoax series that was broadcast on Channel 4 in December 2003 . Pitched as " somewhere between a sitcom and a reality TV show " , the show documented the lives of six young people living in a loft flat in London . Its hook was that its TV audience was aware that three of the participants — named Mel , Paul and Rufus — were actually actors being directed by a trio of " writers " in a garage on the ground floor . 
 Bedsitcom was commissioned by the Channel Four Television Corporation and produced by Objective Productions . Producers auditioned thousands of people to be the show 's genuine contestants and selected from them six young adults to live in the flat with the three actors . These six contestants were told that they would be starring in a new reality TV series called Making Friends , and featured on the show three at a time over a period of eight weeks . The programme ran for a single series of eight episodes and featured various storylines , involving dead goldfish , dodgy dealings , promiscuous mothers and telephone psychics . 
 The show received largely negative feedback from television reviewers , who criticised the show 's premise as a " deeply offensive " idea . It received a viewership peak of 1 @.@ 2 million with its final episode , giving it an audience share of 8 @.@ 9 per cent . Bedsitcom was not recommissioned for a second series and is currently not available either on DVD or on Channel 4 's on demand service , 4oD .

 = = = Concept = = = 
 Bedsitcom was created by Peter James and Andrew O 'Connor , and was conceived as a parody of both reality television and the traditional sitcom . It combined these two elements by featuring three members of the public being unknowingly placed in extraordinary situations by three actors being directed by writers . After being commissioned for Channel 4 by Danielle Lux , Bedsitcom was produced by Matt Crook and Kirsty Smith of Objective Productions . 
 The show was pitched as " somewhere between a sitcom and a reality TV show " and was promoted as " an entirely new genre of television programme " . Its title is a portmanteau of the words " bedsit " — a British term referring to a form of rented accommodation consisting of a single room and shared bathroom — and " sitcom " . The title is technically a misnomer : as the accommodation 's bedroom and sitting area were separate , it was not a bedsit . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Melanie Ash , Paul Gibbon and Rufus Jones were selected as the three actors to feature in Bedsitcom . Jones had previously portrayed the part of Crispin in the 2002 drama White Teeth ; Gibbon had played the lead role of Link in the series Stone Cold . To avoid breaking character , all three used their real names while living in the flat and went through weeks of rehearsals . O 'Connor described the entire process as " exhausting " . 
 To find suitable candidates to live with the three actors , producers auditioned roughly 10 @,@ 000 people , who were told that they would be taking part in a new reality television programme in London called Making Friends . Six members of the public , named Barrington , Bob , Dave , David , Jessica and Shirine , were selected to feature on the show . 
 = = = Writing and filming = = = 
 The plots for Bedsitcom were devised by a team of writers ( led by Rob Gibbons , Neil Gibbons and producer Matt Crook ) located in a garage on the ground floor of the apartment building that the contestants were staying in . The writers would often appear on screen and explain to the TV audience what their intention for each episode was . They communicated with Ash , Gibbon and Jones either by ringing them on their mobile phones , or by calling them downstairs to speak to them in person . They would occasionally change their plans for an episode — in " Worst Case Scenario " , for example , the writers altered their storyline from having Mel bring various animals into the flat to having the group kill Mel 's goldfish after only one night . 
 Among the team of writers were Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain , who had created the Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show with O 'Connor earlier that year , plus Rob Gibbons and Neil Gibbons . Filming of Bedsitcom began in May 2003 and lasted for approximately eight weeks . The flatmates were filmed for 12 hours a day , with this footage then being edited down to roughly 25 minutes per week of filming .

 Bedsitcom documented the lives of six young adults living in a loft flat in London . Eight episodes in total were created , which were divided into two distinct halves . The first four episodes centred on the lives of Mel , Paul and Rufus , the three actors , as they lived in the flat with Bob , Dave and Shirine , the three unaware members of the public who believed they were taking part in a genuine reality TV show . After Bob , Dave and Shirine had learnt the true nature of the show at the end of episode four , they moved out and were replaced by three new members of the public named Barrington , David and Jessica . These three new cast members remained on Bedsitcom for the final four episodes .

 Reviewers gave Bedsitcom generally negative feedback . Some were critical of the storylines that had been devised by the writers , calling them unimaginative and clichéd . Others were critical of the premise of the show itself , describing it as " deeply offensive and manipulative " and " morally reprehensible " — all three actors , particularly Jones , received criticism for their acting abilities . Frances Traynor of The Daily Record called the show " about as funny as sharing a flat with that German cannibal " and Paddy Sherman of The Liverpool Echo branded the show " intensely irritating " . Paul Hoggart of The Times called it " a show that seemed to have nothing to recommend it whatsoever " , — after watching the first episode , Charlie Catchpole of The Daily Star simply stated : " It isn 't funny . " Critics on Newsnight Review also spoke harshly about the programme , with Tom Paulin calling it " a disgraceful piece of television " and Jeanette Winterson describing it as " incredibly dull " . 
 A slightly more positive review came from Joe Joseph of The Times , who suggested that " if [ the format ] works , [ it ] could be profitably franchised around the world " . Deborah Bull said that , while it was " a terrible programme " , there were " some funny lines " . Chris Wilson , editor of Collective , similarly wrote that " while the end results are often amusing and tackle some interesting storylines , the whole project smacks of lazy , cruel television " . 
 In a 2005 interview , series creator Andrew O 'Connor spoke about Bedsitcom and the critical reaction that it had received . He said that he felt that the premise of the show was a " great idea " , but that it did not make " great television " . He also remarked : " We didn 't cast it right and the public didn 't take to the series . "

 " Black & Blue " is a song performed by Swedish indie pop band Miike Snow . It was released as the second single from the band 's 2009 self @-@ titled debut album on 15 October 2009 through Columbia Records . The song was written by the band alongside Henrik Jonback and Juliet Richardson . Band members Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg of production duo Bloodshy & Avant had conceptualized the chorus prior to forming the band with Andrew Wyatt in 2007 , but saved the idea for the Miike Snow project rather than offering it to another artist .

 " Black & Blue " was written by Miike Snow 's three members , Christian Karlsson , Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt , in collaboration with Henrik Jonback and Juliet Richardson . Parts of the chorus were initially conceptualized by Karlsson and Winnberg , also known as Bloodshy & Avant , prior to forming the band in 2007 . Karlsson told music website musicOMH , " It 's the only song on the album that we had an idea before and we kind of saved [ it ] , like we want this song for our own project . When we met Andrew [ Wyatt ] and we decided to start the band , it was only an idea , but we played it for Andrew and he really liked it . " It was recorded at Robotberget , the band 's own studio in Stockholm , Sweden . The band produced the track and then mixed it with Anders Hvenare .

 " Black & Blue " is a blue @-@ eyed soul and electronica piano piece . According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group , the song is written in the time signature of common time with a moderate beat rate of 135 beats per minute . It is written in the key of A ♭ major and Wyatt 's vocal range spans the notes of E ♭ 4 to F5 . It has an A ♭ – B ♭ m – Fm7 – Gm chord progression and a verse @-@ chorus structure . Wyatt sings moody and melancholic lyrics in a " breathy " and " whispery " falsetto vocal style . The production features piano chords over " buzzing " synthesizers . According to BBC Music critic Fraser McAlpine , it includes Coldplay @-@ esque breakdown sections and a " <unk> , mournful piano playing doomy dark chords " . McAlpine compared the verses to " Music Sounds Better with You " ( 1998 ) by French house band Stardust , and Ben Hogwood of musicOMH likened the " soulful approach " to gospel music and works by American duo Outkast . Elliott Townsend of URB called it an " electro @-@ pop throwback " to Curtis Mayfield 's " Move On Up " ( 1970 ) .

Sputnikmusic 's staff reviewer Rudy Klapper felt that the " techno swirl " of the song " nail [ s ] the juxtaposition between Wyatt 's moody lyrics and the irrepressible production " . Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music rated " Black & Blue " four stars out of five and recommended it for when " you just need something to lift the spirits a bit , without someone shouting something stupid in your ear " . He continued , " It basically wants to rub your shoulders at the end of a long hard day , and whisper something funny in your ear while your shoulders untie . " Natalie Kaye of Contactmusic.com said that although it begins melancholy , it " swells to become one of the noisiest points on Miike Snow " . Paul Mitchell of The Skinny felt that Wyatt channels Paddy <unk> 's breathy vocal style on " Black & Blue " , but without the " lyrical wit " . He rated the song three stars out of five and called it " decent " , finding the remixes available on the release more interesting .

 = Alton B. Parker = 
 Alton Brooks Parker ( May 14 , 1852 – May 10 , 1926 ) was an American judge , best known as the Conservative Democrat who lost the presidential election of 1904 to incumbent Theodore Roosevelt in a landslide . 
 A native of upstate New York , Parker practiced law in Kingston , New York , before being appointed to the New York Supreme Court and elected to the New York Court of Appeals ; he served as Chief Judge of the latter from 1898 to 1904 , when he resigned to run for president . In 1904 , he defeated liberal publisher William Randolph Hearst for the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States . In the general election , Parker opposed popular incumbent Republican President Theodore Roosevelt . After a disorganized and ineffective campaign , Parker was defeated by 336 electoral votes to 140 , carrying only the traditionally Democratic Solid South . He then returned to practicing law . He managed John A. Dix 's successful 1910 campaign for Governor of New York and served as prosecution counsel for the 1913 impeachment of Dix 's successor , Governor William Sulzer . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Parker was born in Cortland , New York , to John Brooks Parker , a farmer , and Harriet F. Stratton . Both of his parents were well educated and encouraged his reading from an early age . At the age of 12 or 13 , Parker watched his father serve as a juror and was so fascinated by the proceedings that he resolved to become a lawyer . However , he trained initially as a teacher and taught in Binghamton . There he became engaged to Mary Louise Schoonmaker , the daughter of a man who owned property near his school . Parker married Schoonmaker in 1872 and became a clerk at Schoonmaker & <unk> , a legal firm at which one of her relatives was the senior partner . He then enrolled at Albany Law School . After graduating with an LL.B. degree in 1873 , he practiced law in Kingston until 1878 as the senior partner of the firm Parker & Kenyon . 
 Parker also became active with the Democratic Party and was an early supporter of future New York governor and US President Grover Cleveland . He served as a delegate to the 1884 Democratic National Convention , at which Cleveland was named the party 's presidential nominee ; Cleveland went on to narrowly defeat Republican James G. Blaine in the fall election . During this time , Parker also became a protege of David B. Hill , managing Hill 's 1884 gubernatorial campaign ; Hill won in a landslide . 
 = = Judicial career = = 
 After his election , Hill appointed Parker to fill an 1885 vacancy on the New York Supreme Court created by the death of Justice Theodore R. Westbrook . In 1886 , Parker was elected to his own fourteen @-@ year term in the seat . Three years later , Parker became an appellate judge when Hill appointed him to the newly formed Second Department of the Appellate Division . In November 1897 , Parker successfully ran for the post of Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals , defeating Republican William James Wallace . 
 As a judge , Parker was notable for independently researching each case that he heard . He was generally considered to be pro @-@ labor and was an active supporter of social reform legislation , for example upholding a maximum @-@ hours law as constitutional . In the 1902 decision Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co , Parker found against a woman whose face had been used in advertisements without her permission , ruling that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights . The decision was unpopular in the press and led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year . In the same year , Parker upheld the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place , who became the first woman to be executed by electric chair . 
 During his time as Chief Judge , Parker and his wife sold their Kingston home and bought an estate in Esopus on the Hudson River , calling the house " Rosemount " . The couple had one daughter and one son , the latter of whom died young of tetanus . 
 = = Presidential nomination = = 
 As the 1904 presidential election approached , the Democrats began to search for a nominee to oppose popular incumbent Republican president Theodore Roosevelt , and Parker 's name arose as a possible candidate . Roosevelt 's Secretary of War Elihu Root said of Parker that he " has never opened his mouth on any national question " , but Roosevelt feared that the man 's neutrality would prove a political advantage , writing that " the neutral @-@ tinted individual is very apt to win against the man of pronounced views and active life " . 
 The 1904 Democratic National Convention was held in July in St. Louis , Missouri , then also hosting the 1904 World 's Fair and the 1904 Summer Olympics . Parker 's mentor David B. Hill — having attempted and failed to capture the nomination himself at the 1892 convention — now led the campaign for his protege 's nomination . William Jennings Bryan , who had been nominated but defeated by William McKinley in both 1896 and 1900 , was no longer considered by delegates to be a viable alternative . Radicals in the party supported publisher William Randolph Hearst but lacked sufficient numbers to secure the nomination due to opposition from Bryan and Tammany Hall , a powerful New York political machine . Small clusters of delegates pledged support to other candidates , including Missouri Senator Francis Cockrell ; Richard Olney , Grover Cleveland 's Secretary of State ; Edward C. Wall , a former Wisconsin State Representative ; and George Gray , a former Senator from Delaware . Other delegates spoke of nominating Cleveland , who had already served two nonconsecutive terms , but Cleveland was no longer popular outside the party or even within it , due to his rift with Bryan . 
 Parker 's long service on the bench proved to be an advantage in his nomination , as he had avoided taking stands on issues that divided the party , particularly that of currency standards . Hill and other Parker supporters remained deliberately silent on their candidate 's beliefs . By the time the convention cast their votes , it was clear that no candidate but Parker could unify the party , and he was selected on the first ballot . Henry G. Davis , an elderly West Virginia millionaire and former senator , was selected as the vice presidential candidate in the hope that he would partially finance Parker 's campaign . 
 The convention was riven by debate over whether to include a free silver plank in the campaign 's platform , opposing the gold standard and calling for the government to mint large numbers of silver dollars . The " free silver " movement , a key plank for the party in 1896 and 1900 , was popular among indebted Western farmers who felt that inflation would help them repay their debts . Business interests , in contrast , supported the lower inflation of the gold standard . Bryan , famous for his 1896 " Cross of Gold " speech opposing the gold standard , fought bitterly to avoid the inclusion of the gold standard in the party platform in 1904 . Ultimately the convention agreed not to include a plank on the subject . 
 However , seeking to win the support of the Eastern " sound money " faction , Parker sent a telegram to the convention immediately upon hearing news of his nomination that he considered the gold standard " firmly and irrevocably established " and would decline the nomination if he could not state this in his campaign . The telegram sparked a new debate and fresh opposition from Bryan , but the convention eventually replied to Parker that he was free to speak on the issue as he liked . National support for Parker began to rise , and Roosevelt praised his opponent 's telegram in private as " bold and skillful " and " most adroit " . 
 = = Campaign = = 
 After receiving the nomination , Parker resigned from the bench . On August 10 , he was formally visited at Rosemount by a delegation of party elders to inform him of his nomination . Parker then delivered a speech criticizing Roosevelt for his administration 's involvement in Turkish and Moroccan affairs and having failed to give a date on which the Philippines would become independent of American control ; the speech was considered even by supporters to be impersonal and uninspiring . Historian Lewis L. Gould described the speech as a " fiasco " for Parker from which the candidate did not recover . After this initial speech , Parker retreated into a strategy of silence again , avoiding comment on all major issues . 
 Parker 's campaign soon proved to be poorly run as well . Parker and his advisors opted for a front porch campaign , in which delegations would be brought to Rosemount to see Parker speak on the model of McKinley 's successful 1896 campaign . However , due to Esopus ' remote location and the campaign 's inefficient use of funds to bring in delegates , Parker received few visitors . Rather than introducing issues that would differentiate the two parties , the Democrats preferred to emphasize Roosevelt 's character , portraying him as dangerously unstable . Parker 's campaign also failed to reach out to traditional Democratic voting blocs such as Irish Catholic immigrants . In contrast , Roosevelt 's campaign , headed by George Cortelyou , organized committees to appeal specifically to demographics including Jewish , black , and German @-@ American voters . John Hay , Roosevelt 's Secretary of State , wrote of Parker 's poor showing to Henry Adams , calling it " the most absurd political campaign of our time " . 
 A month before the election , Parker became aware of the large amount of corporate donations Cortelyou had solicited for the Roosevelt campaign , and made " <unk> " a theme of his speeches , accusing the president of being insincere in previous trust busting efforts . In late October , he also went on a speaking tour in the key states of New York and New Jersey , in which he reiterated the president 's " shameless exhibition of a willingness to make compromise with dignity " . Roosevelt , enraged , released a statement calling Parker 's criticisms " monstrous " and " slanderous " . 
 Parker 's attacks came too late to turn the election , however . On November 8 , Roosevelt won in a landslide of 7 @,@ 630 @,@ 457 votes to Parker 's 5 @,@ 083 @,@ 880 . Roosevelt carried every northern and western state , including Missouri , for a total of 336 electoral votes ; Parker carried only the traditionally Democratic Solid South , accumulating 140 electoral votes . Parker telegraphed his congratulations to Roosevelt that night and returned to private life . 
 In Irving Stone 's 1943 book They Also Ran about defeated presidential candidates , the author stated that Parker was the only defeated presidential candidate in history never to have a biography written about him . Stone theorized that Parker would have been an effective president and the 1904 election was one of a few in American history in which voters had two first @-@ rate candidates to choose from . Stone professed that Americans liked Roosevelt more because of his colorful style . 
 = = Later life = = 
 After the election , Parker resumed practicing law and served as the president of the American Bar Association from 1906 to 1907 . He represented organized labor in several cases , most notably in Loewe v. Lawlor , popularly known as the " Danbury Hatters ' case " . In the case , the fur hat manufacturer D. E. Loewe & Company had attempted to enforce an open shop policy ; when unions had subsequently boycotted the company , it sued the United Hatters of North America for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act . The conservative US Supreme Court found for Loewe by ruling that the union had been acting in restraint of interstate commerce . 
 Parker later re @-@ entered politics , managing John Alden Dix 's successful 1910 gubernatorial campaign and delivering the keynote address of the 1912 Democratic National Convention , which nominated Woodrow Wilson for President . In 1913 , he was counsel for the managers of the trial leading to the impeachment of Dix 's successor as governor , William Sulzer . 
 Parker 's wife , Mary , died in 1917 . He remarried in 1923 to Amelia Day Campbell . On May 10 , 1926 , only a few days after recovering from bronchial pneumonia , Parker died from a heart attack while riding in his car through New York City 's Central Park , four days before his 74th birthday . He was buried in <unk> Cemetery in Kingston . 
 = Luan Da = 
 Luan Da ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> Dà ; Wade – Giles : Luan Ta , died 112 BC ; ) was a religious figure during the early Han Dynasty from the state of Yue . He professed to know the secret to immortality and be able to communicate with spiritual beings . Possessing the gift of gab and adept at confidence tricks , Luan Da gained the favour of Emperor Wu of Han , also known as Han Wudi . In the space of a few months , he rose from a commoner to great influence , holding titles and land , and marrying one of the emperor 's daughters . However , he could not fulfill his promise to Emperor Wu , failing to produce a means to immortality . He gradually lost the emperor 's favour and went on a purported visit to immortals ; however , he was eventually captured and executed . At the apex of his career , many of his fellow mystics held him up as their role model and sought to emulate him . His death was a sign of the trade 's fall from favour ; laws were passed to restrict the practice of mediumship , even penalising those who married its practitioners . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Cultural background = = = 
 In early imperial China ( the Qin and Han Dynasties ) , religion centered around the realms of shen ( spirits ) and yin ( shadow ) . These realms were considered sacred , and religious figures attempted to contact their inhabitants through elaborate ceremonies in which the perceptions of the practitioner and audience were blurred through the use of smoke , incense , and music . Other practices were also employed to further manipulate the practitioner 's senses . For example , a chief priest would fast and meditate before he performed a sacrifice . The deprivation of food was thought to make him more susceptible to perceive shen , yin , and other phenomena within the smoke during the ritual . During the Han Dynasty , alleged mediums would fall into trances or perform ritual dances to accomplish supernatural feats . Some of these events were documented in the Shi jing ( Canon of Odes ) , written in the Zhou Dynasty . 
 = = = Han Wudi = = = 
 Emperor Han Wudi was a superstitious man , and believed that he could attain good health and immortality through spiritual means . One such method involved collecting morning dew on a platter and mixing crushed jade with it to form a " spiritual dew " . The emperor routinely drank this " spiritual dew " and only stopped after he fell severely ill from it . 
 The emperor employed several men who claimed to be able to produce elixirs of immortality or who could communicate with spiritual beings . Shaoweng , the court mystic who preceded Luan Da and had studied under the same teacher , performed a ritual that was exposed to be a fraud . Embarrassed that he had been tricked , the emperor ordered Shaoweng 's execution and kept quiet about the affair . Shaoweng purportedly died from consuming horse liver , which was thought to be poisonous at the time . Later , Emperor Wu reconsidered Shaoweng 's fraud , wondering if perhaps some of his mystical arts had been genuine . The emperor realized that his chance for immortality might have passed with Shaoweng 's execution , and began to search for a new mystic . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Not much is known about Luan Da 's early life , only that he was born in Yue and was the eldest child in his family . Records do not even reveal his full name ; the Da ( <unk> ; big ) simply signified his seniority over his siblings . It was conventional at the time to omit surnames for minor figures in the annals of Chinese history , and thus this is not unusual . 
 = = = Rise to power = = = 
 The state of Yue was renowned for its mediums , and Luan Da was a fine example . The Shih ji ( Records of the Grand Historian ) described him as " tall and a brilliant speaker " , who was " fertile in techniques " and a master of esoteric arts , such as shadow play . He was originally a mystic in the court of the emperor 's brother , Liu Ji , the Prince of Jiao Dong . Liu Ji 's wife had mentioned Luan Da to her brother , the Marquess of <unk> , <unk> . Trying to boost his standing with Emperor Wu , <unk> told the emperor of Shaoweng 's far more capable fellow disciple , Luan Da , in 113 BC . 
 Upon their meeting , Emperor Wu inquired into Luan Da and his teacher 's powers . In response , Luan Da boasted that he had met immortals . He also claimed that with enough stature and skill , one could create gold , manufacture a means to achieve immortality , dam the Yellow River , and become an immortal . Luan Da then expressed concern at how Shaoweng had been killed , but the excited emperor assured him that the rumours of Shaoweng 's execution were false . The emperor , in his enthusiasm , offered Luan Da anything if he would take Shaoweng 's place and discover the secret of immortality from his allegedly immortal master . To this , Luan Da replied : 
 " Your servant 's masters seek nothing of men , it is men who seek of them . If Your Majesty is determined to invite them here , then ennoble your envoys , make them imperial relatives , treat them with courtesy due guests , and do not humble them . Let your envoys each hang their seals of office from their girdles , and then you can send them to converse with spiritual beings . Whether the spiritual beings will accede or not is still uncertain , but if you bestow high honors on your envoys , then they may be induced to come . " 
 Remembering his experience with Shaoweng , the emperor turned cautious and tested Luan Da ; he requested the mystic to display his power . Luan Da set down a chess board and , while chanting , caused the chess pieces to charge at one another . The emperor was reassured that Luan Da truly had power . The trick was achieved by coating the pieces in a mixture of rooster 's blood , iron shavings , and " magnetic dust " . In Science and Civilisation in China ( 1986 ) , Joseph Needham discusses the details of this feat and proposed that lodestone was likely used : powdered magnetite would not have been very effective . 
 At that time , the Yellow River was flooding , causing widespread devastation to the people and the rice harvests . As Luan Da had claimed that he could dam the river , Emperor Wu felt that it would be wise to encourage the mystic to take up the task by quickly pleasing him . The emperor granted Luan Da the title of the General of Five <unk> , and almost as an afterthought , three other such titles : the General of Heavenly Practitioners , the General of the Earth Practitioners , and General Grand Communicator . Emperor Wu also lavished gifts on him ; he was granted the marquisate of <unk> , giving him some 2 @,@ 000 households to rule over , and the emperor also gave him a luxurious mansion , a thousand servants , opulent transportation , many decorations , a seal labelled " General of Heavenly Way " , and even the hand in marriage of Princess Wei Zifu , the emperor 's eldest daughter , accompanied by a dowry estimated at 10 @,@ 000 catties of gold . The emperor himself , along with envoys , members of the royal family , and high @-@ ranking officials often invited Luan Da to dine or paid him house calls merely to ask how he was doing . With his marquisate and five <unk> , Luan Da had become a man of great standing only a few months after his introduction to the emperor . He was no longer merely Emperor Wu 's subject , but an envoy of the immortal beings with status equal to the emperor . 
 In possession of these newly @-@ bestowed honours , Luan Da spent every evening at home , attempting to summon spirits . According to the Shih ji , no spirits appeared , but only " a multitude of ghosts who gathered around " . These , the text claims , he was able to command . The Shih ji 's author , Sima Qian , was scornful of Luan Da , noting that " Everyone on the seacoast of Yan and Qi began waving their arms about , declaring that they possessed secret arts and could summon spirits and immortal ones . " Indeed , Luan Da 's dramatic growth in reputation and stature became a great topic of discussion in the Han capital of Chang 'an , and mystics were eager to imitate his success . 
 = = = Fall from power and death = = = 
 By the summer after his elevation , Luan Da had forgotten the emperor 's request for an audience with the immortals . Emperor Wu , anxious to achieve immortality , sent an envoy to remind his court mystic of his task . Luan Da attempted to delay , but eventually realised he had to appease the emperor and allay his suspicions . The mystic decided to put on an act of journeying to meet the immortals . With a group of followers , he travelled to Shandong . Emperor Wu , however , was already suspicious , and sent a spy to follow Luan Da . 
 The spy followed the court mystic to Mount Tai , where he performed a ritual with his followers , although no one saw any immortals . Luan Da ordered his followers to stay behind while he went ahead to meet the immortals , telling them that the spiritual beings would not descend to meet with lowly servants . The spy tailed Luan Da as he went forth alone , but only saw the mystic walk along the beach . Luan Da returned to his group and reported that he had seen his immortal master and that they were to report back to the emperor . Angered by Luan Da 's deceit , the spy rushed back to the capital before the mystic to inform Emperor Wu . The emperor , incensed at Luan Da 's confidence tricks , decided to play along when the mystic returned to see what lies he would tell . 
 When Luan Da returned , he told the emperor of his falsified meeting with the immortals ; however , he sensed that the emperor did not believe him . Before long , the emperor broke out in a rage , ordering Luan Da to tell what he had actually done . Dumbfounded , Luan Da attempted to continue his lies ; however , the emperor called for the spy to come forth and expose the lies . Lost for words , Luan Da was arrested on Emperor Wu 's order , and executed by having his body chopped into two at the waist . The emperor extended his fury to the Marquess of <unk> for introducing Luan Da , having him beheaded and his body then defiled . 
 Later in the Han Dynasty , mystics like Luan gradually lost their influence as the rulers passed many laws against them . <unk> were not allowed to barter their crafts alongside roads , and some were even forbidden to make a living at such a craft at all . Those married to shamans were not even allowed to hold government office , though this law was often bypassed . Luan Da 's fall signaled the beginning of the end for these mystics .

 Dredd is a 2012 science fiction action film directed by Pete Travis and written and produced by Alex Garland . It is based on the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos <unk> . Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd , a law enforcer given the power of judge , jury and executioner in a vast , dystopic metropolis called Mega @-@ City One that lies in a post @-@ apocalyptic wasteland . Dredd and his apprentice partner , Judge Anderson ( Olivia Thirlby ) , are forced to bring order to a 200 @-@ storey high @-@ rise block of flats and deal with its resident drug lord , Ma @-@ Ma ( Lena Headey ) . 
 Garland began writing the script in 2006 , although the development of a new Judge Dredd film adaptation , unrelated to the 1995 film Judge Dredd , was not announced until December 2008 . Produced by British studio DNA Films , Dredd began principal photography , using 3D cameras throughout , in November 2010 . Filming took place on practical sets and locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg . 
 Dredd was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September 2012 worldwide . Critics were generally positive about the film 's visual effects , casting and action , while criticism focused on a perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic and on excessive violence . Despite the positive critical response , the film earned just over $ 41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $ 30 – 45 million . Dredd saw greater success following its home release , and has since been recognised as a cult film . The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely , but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by 2000 AD 's publisher Rebellion have maintained the possibility of a second film . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The future United States is a dystopic irradiated wasteland known as the Cursed Earth . On the east coast lies Mega @-@ City One , a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17 @,@ 000 crimes reported daily . The only force for order are the Judges , who act as judge , jury and executioner . Judge Dredd is tasked by the Chief Judge with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson , a powerful psychic who failed the aptitude tests to be a Judge . 
 In Peach Trees , a 200 @-@ storey slum tower block , drug lord Madeline Madrigal , also known as " Ma @-@ Ma " , executes three rogue drug dealers by having them skinned alive , infused with Slo @-@ Mo ( an addictive new drug which reduces the user 's perception of time to 1 % of normal ) and thrown down the atrium from the top floor . Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den , which they raid . They arrest a thug named Kay , whom Anderson 's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers ' executions . Dredd decides to take him in for questioning . In response , Ma @-@ Ma 's forces seize the tower 's security control room and seal the building , using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test , preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help . 
 Ma @-@ Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed , forcing the Judges to fight their way through dozens of armed thugs . Arriving at the 76th floor , the Judges are assaulted by Ma @-@ Ma and her men with Vulcan cannons that rip through the walls , killing numerous residents . The Judges breach an outer wall and call for backup . Meanwhile , Ma @-@ Ma sends her henchman Caleb to search for the Judges . When they meet , Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma @-@ Ma . 
 Dredd suspects Ma @-@ Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information . Anderson reads Kay 's mind and learns that Peach Trees is the centre of Slo @-@ Mo production and distribution . Anderson suggests they hide while awaiting assistance but Dredd insists they move up the tower and pursue Ma @-@ Ma . Judges Volt and Guthrie respond to Dredd 's call , but Ma @-@ Ma 's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning . A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson , allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson . Kay then escapes with her as hostage , and takes her to Ma @-@ Ma 's base on the top floor . 
 While Dredd works his way towards Ma @-@ Ma , she calls in the corrupt Judges Lex , Kaplan , Chan and Alvarez . The four relieve Volt and Guthrie from duty and are allowed into the building . Dredd encounters Chan and is suspicious that he does not ask about Anderson 's status . Seeing his cover blown , Chan attacks Dredd , but is killed . Meanwhile , Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon , but the pistol 's DNA scanner does not recognise him and explodes , taking his arm off . She escapes and later encounters Kaplan , whom she promptly kills after reading Kaplan 's mind . Elsewhere , Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition , and is shot by Lex in the abdomen . Lex moves in to execute Dredd , but Dredd stalls him long enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex . 
 Anderson and Dredd obtain the code to Ma @-@ Ma 's apartment from her computer expert and confront her . Ma @-@ Ma tells Dredd that , in the case of her death , a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors , destroying the building . Dredd reasons that the detonator 's signal will not reach the explosives from the ground floor , so he forces Ma @-@ Ma to inhale Slo @-@ Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death . 
 In the aftermath , Anderson accepts that she has failed her evaluation by getting disarmed , and leaves . The Chief Judge asks Dredd about Anderson 's performance ; he responds that she has passed . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Karl Urban as Judge Dredd : 
 A famed and feared Judge . Producer Allon Reich described Dredd as " an extreme character , and he administers justice with an extreme lack of prejudice " . Urban approached the producers about joining the film . He found the role challenging because the character never removes his helmet , requiring Urban to convey emotion without using his eyes . He viewed the character as an average man with an insanely tough job in a fragmenting society and likened Dredd 's heroism to that of a fireman . The role also demanded physical preparation ; Urban undertook intensive physical training to become a " beast of a man " . He also underwent weapons and technical training to learn how to operate under fire , how to arrest criminals and breach doors . He insisted on performing his own motorcycle stunts for the film . He played Dredd with a raspy and harsh vocal tone akin to " a saw cutting through bone " , which he found difficult to sustain . 
 Olivia Thirlby as Judge Cassandra Anderson : 
 A rookie Judge and genetic mutant with powerful psychic abilities . Anderson can sense the thoughts and emotions of others . Thirlby contrasted her character with Dredd 's " black and white " perspective , describing Anderson as existing " in a grey area where everything is enhanced or clouded by the fact [ that ] she knows what is going on in the very interior of a person " . She undertook weapons and combat training , learning to perform a roundhouse kick to make her believably physically commanding . The character was partially inspired by singer Debbie Harry . 
 Lena Headey as Ma @-@ Ma ( Madeline Madrigal ) : 
 A former prostitute turned drug lord and criminal kingpin who is the sole supplier of Slo @-@ Mo , a new and addictive drug . Headey 's performance was inspired by punk @-@ rock singer Patti Smith . Reich described the character as someone who does " not care at all about what anybody thinks or feels and she will do , and behave , as she wants " . Headey said : " I think of [ Ma @-@ Ma ] like an old great white shark who is just waiting for someone bigger and stronger to show up and kill her ... she ’ s ready for it . In fact , she can 't wait for it to happen ... She 's an addict , so she 's dead in that way , but that last knock just hasn 't come . " Before Headey 's casting , the character was described as a heavily made @-@ up , scarred and obese older woman . 
 Wood Harris as Kay : 
 Ma @-@ Ma 's clansman . Harris described the character as a villain , but one that sees himself as no worse than the Judges . Harris said : " ... Dredd goes around literally judging and killing people if they do wrong ... Anyone who goes against the system might end up the bad guy . So I think Kay has justified fighting that in his mind . " 
 The cast also includes : Domhnall Gleeson as the gang 's unnamed computer expert , Warrick Grier as Ma @-@ Ma 's right @-@ hand man Caleb ; <unk> <unk> as TJ , Peach Trees ' medic ; Francis <unk> as Judge Guthrie , Daniel <unk> as Judge Volt , and Rakie Ayola as the Chief Judge . Langley Kirkwood , Edwin Perry , Karl <unk> , and Michele Levin portray , respectively , the corrupt Judges Lex , Alvarez , Chan , and Kaplan . Dredd also features Junior <unk> as Amos and Luke Tyler as <unk> , young boys who confront Dredd ; Jason Cope as <unk> , the thug executed by Dredd during the opening scene ; Joe Vaz as Big Joe , the thug that leads the confrontation outside of the med station ; Scott Sparrow as Japhet , Anderson 's first execution , and Nicole Bailey as Cathy , Japhet 's wife , in whose apartment the Judges take refuge .

 = = = Development = = = 
 Development of the film was announced on 20 December 2008 , although writer Alex Garland had begun working on the script in 2006 . British studio DNA Films produced the film , and partnered with sales agency IM Global to sell the worldwide distribution rights . By May 2010 , this partnership saw IM Global and its owner Reliance Big Pictures agree to co @-@ finance the 3 @-@ D project with a $ 45 million production budget , and a schedule to begin filming in Johannesburg , South Africa in late 2010 . Pete Travis was named as the film 's director and Garland , Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich would produce it . Duncan Jones had previously been offered the role of director . In a 2010 interview , Jones said that his vision for the film was unconventional — describing it as weird , dark , and funny — and it did not mesh well with Garland 's script . In September 2010 , it was reported that the film would be titled Dredd . 
 Pre @-@ production commenced on 23 August 2010 at Cape Town Film Studios in Cape Town , South Africa . During the 2010 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International in July , Urban confirmed that he had been offered the role of Judge Dredd and , on 18 August 2010 , it was reported that Urban officially had the role . In September 2010 , it was announced that Thirlby would play Dredd 's telepathic rookie Cassandra Anderson . In the same month during the Toronto International Film Festival , the film attracted $ 30 million in worldwide pre @-@ sales to distributors in 90 % of theatrical markets . The sales included a $ 7 million deal with British distributor Entertainment Film Distributors . 
 On 2 November 2010 , Lions Gate Entertainment secured the North American distribution rights to Dredd . Headey joined the cast as drug @-@ dealer Ma @-@ Ma in January 2011 . Judge Dredd creator John Wagner acted as a consultant on the film . In 2012 , he confirmed that it was a new adaptation of the comic material and was not a remake of the 1995 adaptation Judge Dredd , which starred Sylvester Stallone . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Garland began writing Dredd during post @-@ production of his other writing credit Sunshine , and completed his first draft while serving as an executive producer during filming of 28 Weeks Later . Garland 's draft revolved around one of Dredd 's main enemies , the undead Judge Death . He described the story as a " riff on the whole Judge system " , but that it did not work because the Judge system had not yet been established and required too much knowledge about the Judge Dredd comic from the audience . He also considered the end result too surreal and extreme . From this script , Garland decided that the story needed to be more focused and grounded . He instead considered adapting some of the notable Judge Dredd storylines , including " Democracy " ( 1986 ) and " Origins " ( 2006 ) . He decided to avoid these lengthy tales in favour of a shorter , day @-@ in @-@ the @-@ life story about Dredd and his function as a cop in the dystopian environment of Mega @-@ City One . When developing the Judge Dredd character , Garland tried to closely follow that of the comic @-@ book character , who undergoes only small personality changes over a lengthy period of time . He said : " I didn ’ t think Dredd could have a great epiphany , but there is definitely a change in him over the course of the movie . He makes a very clear statement at the beginning of the film which he then contradicts at the end . That ’ s about as far as the shift goes . " Garland intentionally gave the traditional character development to Anderson to compensate for Dredd 's character stability . 
 Discussing the film 's setting within the Peach Tree Block tower , Garland said the buildings were " like micro city states ... you could live and die in those buildings " . He also considered that the setting met Wagner 's suggestion that the future portrayed in Dredd should relate to modern ways of living . Garland named the tower after a restaurant called " The Peach Tree " , where he first met with Wagner . The budget limited his ability to represent some of the comic aspects of Mega @-@ City One , such as robots and aliens . Throughout the production , Garland would send his script to Wagner , who would revise some of the dialogue . Urban would then further revise the script during his performance . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 The filmmakers decided that Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like " someone who spends hours sort of <unk> himself up . " His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version ; an extruded eagle statuette was removed from his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit 's functionality and give it a sense of realism . Garland said : " If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you 'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he ’ d be in big trouble . Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection . " Remaining faithful to the comic , Dredd 's face , except for his mouth , is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film . Urban said : " He is supposed to be the faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma ... You wouldn 't get to the end of a Sergio Leone Western and go , ' God , I didn 't even know the character 's name ! ' It 's irrelevant . " 
 Dredd 's signature weapon , the " Lawgiver " was developed as a fully operational weapon based on a 9mm firing system , capable of firing ammunition and being changed from automatic to semi @-@ auto fire . His motorcycle " <unk> " was a modified <unk> motorcycle . A large fairing was added over the motorcycle with machine guns , an extended wheel base and the largest functional tyres possible . The vehicle was also operational and Urban insisted on riding it himself rather than relying on Chroma key visual effects . Wagner described the necessity of adaptation from the source material and said that the 1995 film 's attempt to directly replicate the comic 's motorcycle was unable to steer because the tyres were too large . 
 Garland and VFX supervisor Jon Thum began developing the Slo @-@ Mo concept sequences in 2009 during filming for Never Let Me Go . They experimented with an effect to replicate the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs to see how long it could be used before it distracted the viewer from the story or action sequence . They continued to develop and modify the effect until the end of post @-@ production , tweaking colours , colour saturation , image framing and camera motion . Slo @-@ Mo scenes also feature a rainbow colour scheme and sparkle highlights to create an unreal and otherworldly effect . The filmmakers experimented with blood bags , prosthetics , shooting real bullets , and compressed air to see the effect of direct body hits in slow motion . In the finished film , compressed air was used to create impact ripples on flesh . Garland said the concept was inspired by nature documentaries that used high @-@ speed photography to capture animals in slow motion . He said , " You see a whale or a shark breach the water ... then you 'd stop thinking about the animal and you get transfixed by ... how water droplets connect and touch against each other . Somehow like a real [ drug ] trip , sort of stepping outside it but staying attached at the same time . " He questioned whether the technique could be used with violence to make it purely aesthetic . He said : " Can it be so abstract that it becomes genuinely beautiful ? ... really aesthetically beautiful even if someone is having their cheek blown out or their head crushing into concrete . " Comic artist Jock provided concept art for the film design . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 With a $ 45 million production budget , filming began on 12 November 2010 in Cape Town and took approximately 13 weeks , with second unit photography occurring over seven weeks . Filming locations included Johannesburg and Cape Town Film Studios ( Dredd was the first project filmed at the studio ) . The project involved a majority of Cape Town crew members and about 40 imported crew . The producers chose to film in South Africa because of the lowered cost of employing cast and crew compared to locations in Europe and North America , and government incentives that offered to rebate up to 25 % of the production costs . The film was shot digitally and primarily in 3D using RED MX , <unk> and Phantom Flex high @-@ speed cameras . Multiple camera rigs were used . Some 2D elements were converted to 3D in post production . 
 DNA Films ' co @-@ founder Andrew Macdonald engaged cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle to manage the shoot ; it was the first time Mantle had worked with 3D . The filmmakers wanted Dredd to have a realistic , visceral look and drew inspiration from crime and gangster films . For scenes conveying the time and space altering effects of Slo @-@ Mo , Mantle aimed to create images that would be beautiful but disorienting . 
 Mega @-@ City One and its high rise towers were created in Cape Town Film Studios . Finding a suitable set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult , and the producers did not want to build an expensive set . While observing scouting photos of Cape Town , the filmmakers noticed a large three @-@ walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night . A key sequence involving Ma @-@ Ma and her gang firing rotary cannons across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects . Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last @-@ minute flight permissions ; the resulting shots were non @-@ specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story . Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close @-@ up shots . Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve , he said : " I hope it will be more painterly . If we get it right , it will be a cross between Blade Runner and Clockwork Orange . " Garland was a constant presence on the shoot ; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis . 
 = = = Post @-@ production = = = 
 The filmmakers experimented with the visuals of Mega @-@ City One , including the design and positioning of the city 's tower blocks , to create the impression that the city had risen out of the remains of another . They found that replicating the comic visuals of blocks close together made the blocks appear small . Instead they allowed more space between the buildings to emphasise the larger buildings and allow for the presence of roads and cars to allow for extrapolation outside of the picture . Outcrops and appendages were added to break up the buildings ' straight lines . On 7 October 2011 , the Los Angeles Times reported that Travis was prohibited from participating in the editing process following creative disagreements between producers and executives . Garland took over the editing process ; his contribution was considered significant enough for him to seek a co @-@ director credit — a situation considered unusual as Garland had never directed a film before and had not been in charge of any filming . The disagreement concerned a disapproval over the footage that Travis was providing . Although Travis was removed from the editing process he was monitoring the progress of the film . On 10 October , Travis and Garland released a joint statement claiming that they had agreed on an " unorthodox collaboration " before production began , that Travis was still involved in the film and that Garland was not seeking a co @-@ director credit . 
 = = Music = = 
 Paul Leonard @-@ Morgan wrote the film 's industrial music score . Leonard @-@ Morgan created music to suit the film 's futuristic setting . He experimented with band @-@ based music , but decided it sounded over @-@ produced and too safe . He turned to electronic music and used 1980s @-@ style synthesisers and modern sound modules to create various combinations and applied distortion and other effects to the result . Leonard @-@ Morgan said , " I was looking to create a timeless score which couldn 't be placed in any particular era . So it 's ended up being a cross between a modern dance track and evocative soundscapes . " For scenes conveying the effect of the Slo @-@ Mo narcotic , he composed new music with real instruments and then slowed the songs down by thousands of percent to match the visuals , such that one second of his composed score could last 10 minutes . He then added additional real @-@ time score to the slowed track . An unofficially altered Justin Bieber song served as inspiration for the Slo @-@ Mo theme . Garland said that Portishead instrumentalist Geoff Barrow " sent me a link to a Justin Bieber song slowed down 800 times and it became this stunning trippy choral music . " Morgan then recreated the effect based on the modified track , which was used in the finished film . The film used Bieber 's music as a temporary placeholder during editing before the score was finalised . 
 The film also features songs by artists including : " Poison Lips " by <unk> ; " <unk> " by Yann McCullough and Gemma Kicks ; " <unk> " by Matt Berry ; " Pontiac Moon " by Robert J. Walsh ; and " Jubilee ( Don 't Let Nobody Turn You Around ) " by Bobby Womack . 
 All songs written and composed by Paul Leonard @-@ Morgan . 
 = = Marketing = = 
 In August 2012 , the viral advertising site " Dredd Report " was launched , satirising the Drudge Report . The site featured a video condemning the use of Slo @-@ Mo , and links to news about the film . A tie @-@ in comic book was published ; its plot serves as a prequel to the film 's narrative and follows Ma @-@ Ma 's life as a prostitute , controlled by her pimp Lester Grimes . Ma @-@ Ma forms a relationship with Eric — the creator of Slo @-@ Mo . Lester kills Eric for interfering with his business , Ma @-@ Ma castrates Lester with her teeth in retaliation and Ma @-@ Ma takes over the Slo @-@ Mo operation . The comic was written by Judge Dredd Megazine editor Matt Smith , drawn by 2000 AD artist Henry Flint and was released on 5 September 2012 . An exclusive film poster featuring artwork by Jock was released by Mondo to promote the film 's appearance at the 2012 Fantastic Fest in September 2012 . Dredd 's marketing campaign won a Golden Trailer Award for Best Thriller TV Spot for the trailer " Big Addicted " , and received nominations for : Best Action TV Spot , Most Original TV Spot , Best Graphics in a TV Spot , Best Music TV Spot , and Best Action Poster and Most Original Poster for the Dredd motion poster . Reports indicate that Lionsgate contributed $ 25 million to advertising & print costs . Urban has criticised the film 's marketing campaign , saying that the film had " zero audience awareness . Nobody knew the movie was being released . Dredd represents a failure in marketing , not filmmaking . "

 At its premiere screening at the 2012 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , Dredd received positive reviews . IGN awarded the film eight out of ten and said , " Dredd is a character study , primarily , one fuelled by violence and action , and we can 't think of a better way to re @-@ introduce this character to cinema audiences . " Indiewire said , " As Dredd , Urban either has a better character to play than [ Sylvester Stallone ] did , or simply has a better grasp on what makes him tick , but the actor continues to distinguish himself as a versatile performer who turns mimicry into emotional meaning . " Empire 's Chris Hewitt scored the film three out of five stars , and said it gets the lead character " absolutely , incontrovertibly right " and that Urban 's Dredd is " a deadpan delight — he doesn 't grow as a person and he doesn 't crack wise ... the movie generates its few laughs from his sheer intractability " . Hewitt also called Thirlby 's Anderson engaging and wrote that the film is " a solid , occasionally excellent take on [ Judge Dredd ] , with Urban 's chin particularly impressive . " Variety 's Geoff Berkshire said the film is " Grim , gritty and ultra @-@ violent " , called Dredd a " badass of few words " , and wrote that Urban " does a fine job embodying the more mythic qualities of Dredd as an upright law enforcer no lowlife would want to confront . " He also praised Thirlby for carrying the film 's emotional story and said , " one of the film 's true thrills comes in watching Thirlby effortlessly balance the conflict between a Judge 's merciless duties and a psychic 's compassionate understanding . " 
 Entertainment Weekly 's Darren Franich said that the film is a " darkly funny blood @-@ soaked romp " and singled out Urban for his " credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly , imitation @-@ Eastwood voice — and his chin . " The Guardian 's Phelim O 'Neill scored the film 4 stars out of 5 and praised Urban 's performance , saying , " The essence of Dredd is that he is almost an anti @-@ character — he doesn 't change or learn — and Urban nails it in an ego @-@ free performance " . He also wrote , " In a world of compromised adaptations , Dredd is something of a triumph . " The New Statesman 's Laura Sneddon noted that Dredd passed the Bechdel test , lacking in sexism or misogyny and positively portraying female characters who are no weaker , more sexualised or shown less than their male counterparts . Sneddon described Anderson as repeatedly shown to have power over men who underestimate her , while Ma @-@ Ma displays more intelligence and sadism than any of her male gang members , and neither woman interacts with the other on the basis of their gender . The Hollywood Reporter 's Stephen Dalton wrote that the " dark , ironic , very British humour of the original strip " was largely absent from the film and that " [ t ] he limited location , computer game @-@ style plot and muted humour " of the film might disappoint some fans of the comic . Dalton also said that Urban 's performance , while close to the comic , lacked something . Overall , however , Dalton said , " [ p ] <unk> at the right level to please original fans , but still slick and accessible enough to attract new ones , [ Dredd ] feels like a smart and muscular addition to the sci @-@ fi action genre .

 Many US newspaper critics were less taken with the film . Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times called it " a clunk @-@ headed action picture " that " simply becomes a monotonous series of bad @-@ guy confrontations . " Frank Lovece of Newsday described it as a " <unk> gritty " film , which apart from one believable scene involving Thirlby , is " all tough @-@ guy talk and humorless cynicism " . Kyle Smith of the New York Post , who found the police tactics distasteful , wrote , " Justice is supposed to be blind , but in this case I think what the Law really wants is <unk> " and called Dredd a " thudding , repetitive movie " , He also wrote , " It ’ s not that the movie is in bad taste or cheesy ( though it is ) but that all of its hyper @-@ violence adds up to nothing " . Stephen Whitty of The Star @-@ Ledger called it a " gray and ugly film " , said that there was little to draw viewers in , and wrote that apart from the drug @-@ induced slow @-@ motion sequences , the film offers nothing new . 
 The visual effects and slow @-@ motion sequences induced by Slo @-@ Mo received broad praise . Berkshire said that they are notable and eye @-@ catching with " impressively utilised 3d . " Hewitt said the visuals were " genuinely surreal splashes of heightened colour that ... don ’ t outstay their welcome . The film 's use of 3D is often excellent ( including the credits ) and it really comes to life in the Slo @-@ mo scenes " . Dalton said the film " constantly impresses on a visual level , with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like District 9 or 28 Days Later than to standard Hollywood comic @-@ book blockbusters . " Dalton said , " [ Mantle 's ] first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours , gorgeous high @-@ resolution close @-@ ups and dazzling slow @-@ motion sequences . " Dredd won The Art of 3D award at the 2013 Empire Awards , and was nominated for Best British Film and Best Science @-@ fiction / Fantasy . 
 Judge Dredd creator John Wagner , who had been critical of the 1995 adaptation , gave a positive review of Dredd . He said : " I liked the movie . It was , unlike the first film , a true representation of Judge Dredd ... Karl Urban was a fine Dredd and I 'd be more than happy to see him in the follow @-@ up . Olivia Thirlby excelled as Anderson ... The character and storyline are pure Dredd . " Dredd has been recognised as a cult film since its release . Some reviewers drew comparisons between Dredd and The Raid : Redemption , another action film released a few months earlier , noting that similar elements in setting , story , and characters made Dredd appear derivative .

 At the London Film and Comic Con in July 2012 , Garland said that a North American gross of over $ 50 million for Dredd would make sequels possible and that he had plans for a trilogy of films . A second film would focus on the origins of Dredd and Mega @-@ City One , and a third would introduce Dredd 's nemeses , the undead Judge Death and his Dark Judges . In August 2012 , Garland said that a Judge Dredd television series would be a positive future step for the series . In September 2012 , Garland said that he would explore the " Origins " and " Democracy " storylines , would introduce characters Judge Cal and Chopper , and would pursue the concept that Judge Dredd is a fascist . That same month , Macdonald said that further films would be made in partnership with IM Global and would likely be shot in South Africa . 
 In March 2013 , executive producer Adi Shankar said that a sequel was unlikely . In May 2013 , Urban said that a sequel was still possible , noting that the film had found an audience , and the response of fans could resurrect the project . Dredd fans on Facebook launched a petition calling for a sequel . In July 2013 , 2000 AD endorsed the fan petition , supporting the campaign by printing advertisements in their publications , and by September 2013 , it had attracted over 80 @,@ 000 signatures . In April 2013 , 2000 AD released an image teasing a continuation of the film in comic book form with a release date scheduled for September 2013 . The comic , titled Dredd : Underbelly , was made available in Judge Dredd Megazine # 340 which was released on 18 September 2013 . 
 In October 2014 , Shankar announced the production of an unofficial spinoff online series based on the Dark Judges that would be released later that month . The animated miniseries was titled Judge Dredd : <unk> and all its six episodes were released on 27 October 2014 on YouTube . In March 2015 , Garland said that a direct sequel would likely not happen in the near future ; at least not with the crew involved in the original film . 
 In 2016 , Urban said that " conversations are happening " regarding a Dredd continuation on streaming services Netflix or Amazon Prime . In an interview in May 2016 , Urban said that while the film 's " mishandled " marketing strategy and " unfortunate " box office performance meant that it was " problematic " to try to make a sequel , " the success it has achieved in all post @-@ theatrical mediums has definitely strengthened the argument in favour of a sequel . But it 's not an easy sell . " He added that he would be " blessed and it would be a privilege " to make a sequel or a Dredd television series . In June 2016 , Urban announced at the Denver Comic Con that a sequel story was in development , for potential adaptation as a television series or film . He later clarified that , although options had been discussed , no sequel was in development . 
 = New York State Route 61 = 
 New York State Route 61 ( NY 61 ) is a state highway located almost entirely in the city of Niagara Falls in Niagara County , New York , in the United States . The road runs across the city in a northwest – southeast direction , terminating at NY 384 at its southern extent and NY 104 at its northern tip . Conceptually , the road , known as Hyde Park Boulevard , forms the eastern border of downtown Niagara Falls . It is the second @-@ shortest two @-@ digit route in New York after NY 71 in Columbia County . The NY 61 designation was assigned c . 1962 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 61 begins at an intersection with NY 384 ( Buffalo Avenue ) on the industrial banks of the Niagara River in eastern Niagara Falls . The route , named Hyde Park Boulevard for its entire length , heads north initially as a city @-@ maintained , undivided four @-@ lane highway ; after two blocks , the roadway widens and becomes maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation . NY 61 continues onward through the densely populated neighborhoods of Niagara Falls to Packard Road , where the route begins to parallel Gill Creek , a small stream leading south to the Niagara River . After five blocks , NY 61 intersects with Ferry Avenue , a one @-@ way street carrying southbound U.S. Route 62 ( US 62 ) , in the area of the Niagara Falls Courthouse . NY 61 intersects with northbound US 62 three blocks later at Walnut Avenue . At the intersection , Gill Creek passes under both US 62 northbound and NY 61 as it switches to the east side of Hyde Park Boulevard . 
 Gill Creek and NY 61 continue to run parallel for one more block before they separate ahead of Pine Avenue , once known as NY <unk> and now designated as US 62 Business . The intersection between Pine and Hyde Park Boulevard marks the southwestern limits of Hyde Park , one of the largest parks in the vicinity of the city . For the next dozen blocks , NY 61 acts as the divider between the residential neighborhoods of downtown Niagara Falls and the open spaces of Hyde Park , passing Sal Maglie Stadium as it heads north . At Linwood Avenue , the homes return to both sides of NY 61 as it approaches Porter Road , which carries NY 182 . While Porter Road ends here , NY 182 turns north , joining NY 61 for two blocks to Ontario Avenue , where NY 182 turns west toward the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge . 
 North of Ontario Avenue , the buildings surrounding NY 61 become more commercial and industrial in nature as the route approaches the CSX Transportation Niagara Yard . It crosses over the western end of the yard before intersecting Lockport Road . The Niagara Falls Amtrak station , which Hyde Park Boulevard passes by but provides no access to , is located just off Lockport Road on 27th Street . 
 Away from the yard , the surroundings become residential once more for another four blocks before entering a heavily industrial neighborhood around an intersection with NY 31 . Farther north in Lewiston , the center turn lane becomes a hard median as it widens in preparation for a pseudo @-@ interchange with Highland Avenue . The median reverts to its previous width shortly after Highland merges into Hyde Park Boulevard ; however , the median ends two blocks later at a service road for the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant . NY 61 , now a four @-@ lane undivided highway once again , continues for another 0 @.@ 25 miles ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) to the top of the Niagara River gorge , where it ends at NY 104 south of the Moses Power Plant and adjacent to the campus of Niagara University . 
 = = History = = 
 NY 61 was assigned c . 1962 to its current alignment . In that same year , the bridge carrying Hyde Park Boulevard over Gill Creek at Walnut Avenue , 41 feet ( 12 m ) in length and originally built in 1950 , was reconstructed . Farther north , the bridge over the western end of the CSX Transportation Niagara Yard , at 355 feet ( 108 m ) long , was completed in 1964 . It was reconstructed in 1997 .

 = Yoichi Hiruma = 
 Yoichi Hiruma ( Japanese : <unk> <unk> , Hepburn : Hiruma Yōichi ) , commonly referred to just as Hiruma ( <unk> ) , is a fictional character in the anime and manga series Eyeshield 21 , created by Riichiro Inagaki and Yusuke Murata . In the series , he is the captain of the Deimon Devil Bats , a high school American football club founded by him and two other students . Due to the lack of interest in the sport , Hiruma uses blackmail and threats to recruit players to Devil Bats . Hiruma witnesses Sena Kobayakawa 's running abilities and forces the boy to join the team as the running back as soon as he can . Hiruma has appeared in other media from the series , including video games , original video animations ( OVAs ) , and light novels . 
 According to Inagaki , Hiruma was created to be a " devil @-@ hero " , or a kind of anti @-@ hero . Due to this , Murata , the manga 's illustrator , tried to give Hiruma a demonic appearance . In the OVA , released before the anime 's start , he is voiced by Shin @-@ ichiro Miki . However , in the 2005 Japanese anime television series , he was replaced by Atsushi Tamura , who was chosen by the manga series creators due to his voice , which they believed was perfect for the role . His voice actor in the English adaptation is Derek Stephen Prince . Hiruma has been well received by publications for manga and anime . Numerous pieces of merchandise in Hiruma 's likeness have also been released , including decals and statues of ceramic and resin . 
 = = Development and voice portrayal = = 
 Riichiro Inagaki , the writer of Eyeshield 21 , has said that he developed Hiruma as a character that does not follow the Japanese concepts of emphasis on sportsmanship and effort in the game ; instead , Hiruma is " only concerned with winning " . Inagaki intended to make an " anti @-@ hero " or , as he refers to the concept , a " devil @-@ hero " . Yusuke Murata , the artist , chose to portray Hiruma as looking " close to being a demon " , since he heard from Inagaki that Hiruma had " the personality of a demon . " Murata has noted that the Devil Bats logo " bears a strong resemblance to Hiruma " . Inagaki also stated that Hiruma 's name is a homage to the British former Formula One driver Damon Hill . 
 He was voiced by Shin @-@ ichiro Miki in the first anime adaptation of the Eyeshield 21 manga , a 2003 Jump Festa OVA titled The Phantom Golden Bowl . The subsequent television adaptation , however , did not use Miki ; rather , Atsushi Tamura was chosen . Though the animation studio administrated casting , the studio asked Inagaki and Murata for their opinions . The two both felt that Tamura was a " perfect fit " due to " his voice and his style " . In the English dubbing , the role was voiced by Derek Stephen Prince .

 Seven years prior to the start of the series , a ten @-@ year @-@ old Hiruma snuck into an American military base , where he witnessed a group of soldiers playing American football . He soon learned the sport 's rules and managed to successfully gamble on the winning teams , accumulating a large amount of money . He entered Mao Junior High , where he met <unk> Kurita , who encouraged Hiruma to create his own team . In order to establish an American football club , Hiruma created an information network to acquire blackmail , allowing him to threaten the vice principal of Mao into allowing the establishment of the club . Gen " Musashi " <unk> also decided to join , and the three new friends made a pact to reach the Christmas Bowl — the high school football league championship . They decided to join the Shinryuji Naga , but because Kurita could not pass the Shinryuji exam , Hiruma and Musashi went to Deimon High School , and with Kurita established the Deimon Devil Bats . 
 At the beginning of the series , Hiruma and Kurita , now in their second year of high school , attempt to recruit new members to the Deimon Devil Bats . At first their only successful recruit is Sena Kobayakawa , as Hiruma witnesses his incredible running speed and agility and forces him to be the team 's running back . Hiruma additionally hides Sena 's identity by making him wear an eyeshield and adapt the moniker " Eyeshield 21 " . Hiruma , through intimidation , blackmail , cyber terrorism , and other similar methods , plays a crucial role in the development of the young Devil Bats team . Hiruma 's insight and strategic mind , especially his knack for devising trick plays and his psychological games , are critical in the Devil Bats ' various matches . His demonic façade is also seen through by the team manager , Mamori Anezaki , whom he shares a deep understanding with despite constant bickering and teasing . 
 After winning the Christmas Bowl , Hiruma is selected by the Ojo White Knights ' Seijuro Shin to be one of Team Japan 's two quarterbacks for the International Youth American Football tournament due to his knack for trick plays . Hiruma quickly settles in as the main strategist on the team . Even before this , Hiruma spies on Team USA to acquire information on the ace American players , who are considered by far the favorites to win the tournament . In typical fashion , Hiruma refuses to permit players on the team out of sympathy rather than merit , including his Devil Bats teammates , but does agree with the decision to hold a final tryout as a method of enlisting bench players . Two years later , Hiruma , now in college , is part of the college 's American football team , <unk> , opposing some of his former teammates ( students at other colleges ) as they compete to play in the Rice Bowl — the game between the best college American football teams . 
 = = = Appearances in other media = = = 
 Hiruma has made several appearances outside of the Eyeshield 21 anime and manga . He appears in both of the original video animations produced for the series , helping the Deimon Devil Bats defeat the <unk> Boarders in a tournament called the Golden Bowl in the first original video animation , and leaving his teammates on a desert island so they train in the second . Hiruma also appears in all Eyeshield 21 games , which usually feature the original manga story , except for Eyeshield 21 : Devilbats Devildays , which features exclusive stories . He also appears in the crossover games Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars as a supporting character .

 The character of Hiruma has been well received by manga readers , and as the series continued he went on to become one of the most popular characters among the Eyeshield 21 reader base , having consistently placed near the top of the Weekly Shōnen Jump character popularity polls of the series . In the first poll he placed second , behind Sena , but in another two he ranked first . He was also chosen by the readers as the character who would win an " Evil Showdown " against Agon Kongo , as well as the best quarterback in the series . In an interview , Atsushi Tamura said about Hiruma : " I look just like this guy " ; and stated that he " think [ s ] there is a lot of other people who want to do the Hiruma 's role " . Several pieces of merchandise based on Hiruma have also been released , including decals and statues of ceramic and resin . 
 Several publications for manga , anime , video games , and related media have commented on Hiruma 's character . Chris Beveridge from Mania.com stated that " the outlandish nature of Hiruma with his guns blazing gets old very quickly " and considered it a " downside " to the series . On the other hand , Ain 't It Cool News ' Scott Green said that " impish Hiruma starts out as a unique star . " Mania.com 's Jarred Pine noted that Hiruma is " so completely over @-@ the @-@ top and out of left field that I couldn ’ t help laughing " and that his " rude , crude , and completely unpredictable " behavior " makes his character so damn enjoyable " . Pine concluded that Hiruma 's personality was " instantly memorable " and his " unpredictable nature " was responsible for making the story " so enjoyable " . The contrast with " Sena 's hard effort and Hiruma 's trickery and devilish nature " was also praised by Pine . Writing for Anime News Network , Carlo Santos praised Hiruma 's character design as " imaginative " with his " lanky " and " demon @-@ like appearance " and additionally commented that " despite his sheer ruthlessness , it 's hard not to laugh as Hiruma enthusiastically resorts to blackmail in recruiting students for the team " . Erin Finnegan of Anime News Network also noted the " demonic @-@ looking " aspect of Hiruma , saying he is " like a predecessor of Ozu from The <unk> Galaxy with a love of football " . Anime News Network 's Zac Bertschy called Hiruma the " most fun " character insofar , making note of his " brash , menacing and ultimately passionate " personality and that " in a sense , Hiruma turns the ' kindly old coach @-@ come @-@ mentor who helps the hero along ' cliché on its ear " .

 The codex originally contained the entire Pauline epistles . The leaves were arranged in quarto ( four leaves in quire ) . Only 41 leaves ( 30 cm by 25 cm ) of the codex have survived . The text is written on parchment in large , square uncials ( over 1 @.@ 5 cm ) , in one column per page , and 16 lines per page . The breathings ( designated by <unk> and <unk> ) and accents were added by a later hand ( not to the subscriptions ) . Accents often were put in wrong places . Iota <unk> does not occur , there are some errors of itacism ( <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> ) . The nomina sacra are written in an abbreviated way ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) , the words at the end of the line are contracted . 
 The text is divided according to the κεφαλαια ( chapters ) , whose numbers are given at the margin . It contains also tables of the κεφαλαια ( tables of contents ) before each book . 
 The value of the codex is indicated by its subscription at the end of the Epistle to Titus : 
 <unk> καὶ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> τὸ <unk> <unk> τοῦ <unk> πρὸς <unk> καὶ <unk> <unk> … <unk> δὲ ἡ <unk> πρὸς τὸ ἐν <unk> <unk> τῆς <unk> τοῦ ἀγίου <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 I , <unk> , wrote this volume of the Apostle Paul as carefully as possible in <unk> , so that it might be read with intelligence : the book was compared with the copy in the library at Caesarea , written by the hand of <unk> the saint .

 The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text @-@ type , but with a large number of Byzantine readings . According to Lagrange the text is similar to that of Codex Vaticanus . It is one of the witnesses for the Euthalian recension of the Pauline epistles . 
 According to Eberhard Nestle it is " one of the most valuable manuscripts " . Kurt and Barbara Aland gave the following textual profile of it 71 , 01 / 2 , 122 , 3s . This means the text of the codex agrees with the Byzantine standard text 7 times , it agrees 12 times with the original text against the Byzantine and that it has 3 independent or distinctive readings . Aland considered the quality of the text to suit his Category III . The corrections in the text are almost always representative of the Byzantine textual tradition .

 The codex was probably written in the 6th century at the library in Caesarea , later coming into the possession of the monastery of the Great Lavra on Mount Athos , but its value appears to have been overlooked . Leaves of the codex were used as raw material for the production of new volumes . In 975 some leaves , now known as Fragmenta <unk> , were used to cover a volume of Gregory <unk> at Mount Athos . In the 12th century Fragmenta <unk> were used in Nicetas ' catenae to the <unk> , in 1218 another part , now named as Fragmenta <unk> , were used with the same purpose . 
 As a result , leaves of the codex were scattered in several places of the monastery , from where they were collected on several occasions by people from France , Russia , and Italy . The first was Pierre <unk> ( 1588 – 1672 ) , who bought 14 leaves which , known later as Fragmenta <unk> , and became a part of the Fonds <unk> . They were held in Saint @-@ Germain @-@ des @-@ Prés . In 1715 Bernard de Montfaucon published text of these 14 leaves . He made a few mistakes corrected by Tischendorf ( in 1865 ) . Tischendorf observed in Paris additional passage . Montfaucon used the manuscript for his palaeographical studies . 
 After the fire of St. Germain @-@ des @-@ Prés in 1793 only 12 leaves were found , the other two have been transferred to Saint Petersburg . From 1795 until the present it has been held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France . Fragmenta <unk> were brought to Moscow in 1665 . They were examined by Matthaei . The last was Porphyrius Uspensky , who took one leaf from the monastery . 
 The codex is located in eight places , in seven libraries , in six cities in Europe . The bulk of the surviving leaves ( 22 leaves ) are held in two collections in Paris , both in the National Library of France ( <unk> . Gr . 1074 , and <unk> 202 ) . Eight leaves have not left the Great Lavra . Nine leaves are held in Ukraine or Russia , three each in Kiev ( Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine ) , Saint Petersburg and Moscow ( Hist . Mus . 563 , and Russian State Library , Gr . 166 @,@ 1 ) . Finally , two leaves are held in Turin . 
 Henri <unk> published the part of the codex known to him . Another part of the codex housed at Athos was published by Kirsopp Lake , in 1905 . It is cited in the printed editions of the Greek New Testament since Tischendorf 's edition . 
 The manuscript is cited in all critical editions of the Greek New Testament ( UBS3 , UBS4 , NA26 , NA27 ) . In NA27 it belongs to the witnesses consistently cited of the first order .

 Poquita Ropa is similar in style to Arjona 's work on Galería Caribe ( 2000 ) . With the album , Arjona wanted to drastically change his musical style . He tried to use as few instruments as possible , resulting in a production that sounds like a capella performances . Arjona talking about the album , stated that " music and women look better with little clothes " , and that " they [ the songs ] are like women ; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes , more beauty . The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves , because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them . " 
 Arjona produced the album with the assistance of Dan Warner , who has worked with Shakira , Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera . Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic commented that Poquita Ropa " finds Arjona at his most naked , backed by spare arrangements of acoustic guitar , piano , and Hammond B @-@ 3 along with occasional touches of strings , woodwinds , and chorus vocals . " Poquita Ropa was the first album that Arjona recorded without producer Tommy Torres , whose last production was 5to Piso ( 2008 ) .

 = Hurricane Frank ( 2010 ) = 
 Hurricane Frank was the last of three hurricanes in the 2010 Pacific hurricane season , which set a record low within modern day records for the basin . It formed from an area of thunderstorms from the Caribbean Sea , and became Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E on August 21 while located just south of the Mexican Coast . It moved northwest , and became Tropical Storm Frank only 12 hours after it was declared a depression . It strengthened to its initial peak as a moderate tropical storm , and weakened due to increasing wind shear late on the August 23 . It later recovered , and became a hurricane on August 25 . After peaking as a strong Category 1 hurricane , it rapidly weakened , and dissipated on August 28 . Although Frank never made landfall , it did impact western Mexico . A total of six people were killed with over 800 @,@ 000 people affected . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Frank origins were difficult to track from a tropical wave from the west coast of Africa . A large area of thunderstorms formed near the Windward Islands . Atmosphere convection fluctuated as its associated tropical wave moved across the Caribbean Sea and a mid @-@ level circulation developed . Shower and thunderstorm activity increased as it crossed Central America , and a broad area of low pressure formed about 115 mi ( 185 km ) south of the Mexican coast on August 19 . The system was in a favorable environment , thus gradual development was anticipated . On August 21 , the atmospheric convection had become better organized , and it develop curved rainbands . On 1800 UTC August 21 , advisories were initiated on Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E while located roughly 205 mi ( 330 km ) southeast of Salina Cruz , Mexico . 
 Upon becoming a tropical cyclone , the storm was located in a favorable environment with sea surface temperatures near 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) and fairly weak wind shear . As such , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) anticipated the storm to reach minimal hurricane intensity . Due to weak steering currents , the depression drifted westbound . Initially there was no change in organization , but on August 22 , the cloud patterns improved . Based on estimates from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch ( TAFB ) , the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Frank on 1200 UTC August 22 . Although deep convection had weakened , the NHC re @-@ assessed the intensity at 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) later that day . However , high levels of northeasterly wind shear caused the system to weaken slightly the next day , and by early August 24 , the NHC was no longer forecasting the storm to become a hurricane . Despite the shear , there was a burst of deep convection later that day and a gradual increase in organization . Microwave imagery at 0834 and 1714 UTC showed a closed ring of thunderstorm activity that resembled an eye and by early August 25 , the cyclone was just below hurricane intensity . 
 During the next six hours , Frank became much better organized with a large area of very deep convection near the center . Based on this , the NHC upgraded the system into a hurricane . Gradually intensifying , an eye became <unk> visible on infrared imagery and a persistent eye was visible via microwave imagery . On 1800 UTC , Frank reached its peak intensity of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) and 978 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 88 inHg ) while located 350 mi ( 560 km ) south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . While at peak intensity , satellite imagery showed a small but distinct eye surrounded by a central dense overcast , or a large area of thunderstorm activity . Moving west @-@ northwest , Frank began a weakening trend overnight as the eye became less defined . Continuing to weaken , Frank became less organized and its eye collapsed . On August 27 , the NHC downgraded Frank into a tropical storm , with poorly organized convection located west of the center due to strong wind shear . As such , the agency predicted the storm to weaken into a tropical depression within the next 36 hours . Frank rapidly lost all thunderstorm activity because of cooler water , and the storms intensity was reduced to a swirl of clouds while it turned towards the north due to a mid @-@ level trough . The cyclone weakened back into a tropical depression early on August 28 . Frank degenerated into a remnant low while located 230 mi ( 370 km ) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California . The remnant low dissipated early on August 29 . 
 = = Preparations , impact , and aftermath = = 
 Although Frank never made landfall , it did come very close to the Mexican Riviera , and upon development , a tropical storm watch was issued for parts of the Mexican coast by the local government . On 1800 UTC August 22 , a tropical storm warning was issued . These watches and warnings were dropped on August 24 as the system moved away from the coast . The National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of up to 10 in ( 250 mm ) in the high terrain of Mexico . These rains had the potential to produce life @-@ threatening flash floods and mudslides . Officials gave Frank a hazard rating of intense for the Mexican Pacific , and strong for Baja California Sur . In Guerrero , Michoacán , and Jalisco , alerts were issued due to the threat of torrential rainfall . Forecasters also noted the possibility of the storm affecting Sinaloa , with high waves being the main threat . 
 The maximum 24 ‑ hour rainfall total was 14 in ( 360 mm ) in Miguel de la Madrid , Oaxaca . In addition , seven other sites received more than 4 in ( 100 mm ) of rain in a 24 @-@ hour period . The storm also produced gusty conditions along the Mexican coast . In addition , a total of six deaths were reported . A total 30 homes were destroyed with 26 others damaged due to flooding . Two major roads were damaged with another road blocked due to a landslides . Several rivers overflowed their banks , thus causing 171 rural communities to be flooded in seven municipalities . In the state of Tabasco over 800 @,@ 000 people were affected . The city of Villahermosa received the worst flood since 2007 , and a total of 8 @,@ 500 people were victims of the storm . To prevent the situation from getting worse , residents piled up sandbags . In Oaxaca , four people were killed . A mudslide in the municipality of <unk> Villa de Morelos caused two farmers to die . Another mudslide in Oaxaca caused six vehicles to drive off Federal Highway 182 , causing two more deaths . A total of 60 @,@ 000 people were homeless . Many communities were isolated as several bridges and roads were destroyed due to the heavy rainfall . 
 In the aftermath of the storm , the Mexican Army provided aid for the people affected . A total of 110 communities requested assistance from the government . By September 14 , an estimated 200 @,@ 000 food packages were distributed to the region . Damage repairs from Hurricane Frank totaled to 100 million pesos ( $ 8 @.@ 3 million USD ) . 
 = William Henry Sheppard = 
 William Henry Sheppard ( 1865 – 1927 ) was one of the earliest African Americans to become a missionary for the Presbyterian Church . He spent 20 years in Africa , primarily in and around the Congo Free State , and is best known for his efforts to publicize the atrocities committed against the Kuba and other Congolese peoples by King Leopold II 's Force Publique . 
 Sheppard 's efforts contributed to the contemporary debate on European colonialism and imperialism in the region , particularly amongst those of the African American community . However , it has been noted that he traditionally received little attention in literature on the subject . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Sheppard was born in Waynesboro , Virginia on March 8 , 1865 , to William Henry Sheppard , Sr. and Fannie Frances Sheppard ( née Martin ) , a free " dark mulatto " , a month before the end of the American Civil War . No records exist to confirm William Sr. ' s status as a slave or freedman , but it has been speculated that he may have been among the slaves forced to serve the Confederacy as Union troops marched upon the South . William Sr. was a barber , and the family has been described as the closest to middle class that blacks could have achieved given the time and place . At age twelve , William Jr. became a stable boy for a white family several miles away while continuing to attend school ; he remembered his two @-@ year stay fondly and maintained written correspondence with the family for many years . Sheppard next worked as a waiter to put himself through the newly created Hampton Institute , where Booker T. Washington was among his instructors in a program that allowed students to work during the day and attend classes at night . A significant influence on his appreciation for native cultures was the " Curiosity Room " , in which the school 's founder maintained a collection of Native Hawaiian and Native American works of art . Later in life he would collect artifacts from the Congo , specifically those of the Kuba , and bring them back for this room , as evidenced by his letters home , such as " [ i ] t was on the first of September , 1890 that William H. Sheppard addressed a letter to General Samuel Armstrong , Hampton , From Stanley Pool , Africa , that he had many artifacts , spears , idols , etc . , and he was ' ... saving them for the Curiosity Room at Hampton ' " . 
 After graduation , Sheppard was recommended to Tuscaloosa Theological Institute ( now Stillman College , which dedicated its library in Sheppard 's honor in 1959 ) in Alabama . He met Lucy Gantt near the end of his time there and the two became engaged , although they would not marry for ten years . Sheppard cultivated a desire to preach in Africa , but despite the support of Tuscaloosa founder Charles Stillman , the Southern Presbyterian Church had yet to establish its mission in the Congo . He was ordained in 1888 and served as pastor to a church in Atlanta , Georgia , but did not adapt well to the life of an urban black in a heavily segregated area of the Southern United States . After two years of writing to the Presbyterian Foreign Missionary Board in Baltimore , Maryland to inquire about starting a mission in Africa , he became frustrated by the vague rationale of the rejection letters and took a train to Baltimore to ask the chairman in person . The man politely informed Sheppard that the board would not send a black man without a white supervisor . 
 Samuel Lapsley , an eager but inexperienced white man from a wealthy family , finally enabled Sheppard 's journey to Africa . They " inaugurated the unique principle of sending out together , with equal ecclesiastical rights and , as far as possible , in equal numbers , white and colored workers " . 
 = = Mission with Lapsley = = 
 Sheppard and Lapsley 's activities in Africa were enabled by the very man whose atrocities Sheppard would later attempt to expose . The pair traveled to London in 1890 en route to the Congo ; while there , Lapsley met General Henry Shelton Sanford , an American ally of King Leopold II and friend of a friend of Lapsley 's father . Sanford promised to do " everything in his power " to help the pair , even arranging an audience with King Leopold when Lapsley visited him in Belgium . Neither the secular Sanford nor the Catholic Leopold were interested in the Presbyterians ' work ; the latter was eager to have them make inroads into his newly acquired territory , both to begin the process of " civilizing " the natives and to legitimize his rule . The missionaries were , however , oblivious of Leopold 's true motives . 
 The pair made their way to Leopoldville , and Sheppard 's own writings as well as Lapsley 's letters home suggest Sheppard viewed the natives in a markedly different manner from other foreigners . Sheppard was considered as foreign as Lapsley and even acquired the nickname " <unk> N <unk> " , or " black white man " . Despite being of African descent , Sheppard believed in many of the stereotypes of the time regarding Africa and its inhabitants , such as the idea that African natives were uncivilized or savage . Very quickly though his views changed , as exemplified by a journal entry : 
 I grew very found of the <unk> and it was reciprocated . They were the finest looking race I had seen in Africa , dignified , graceful , courageous , honest , with an open smiling countenance really hospitable . Their knowledge of weaving , embroidering , wood @-@ carving and smelting was the highest equatorial Africa . 
 The natives ' resistance to conversion bothered Lapsley more than Sheppard , as Sheppard viewed himself more as an explorer than a missionary . While Lapsley was on a trip to visit fellow missionary – explorer George Grenfell , Sheppard became familiar with the natives ' hunting techniques and language . He even helped to avert a famine by slaying thirty @-@ six hippos . Sheppard contracted malaria 22 times in his first 2 years in Africa . 
 = = Contact with the Kuba = = 
 Having become versed in Kuba language and culture , Sheppard took a team of men to the edge of Kuba territory in 1892 . His original plan was to ask for directions to the next village under the guise of purchasing supplies , but the chief of the village only allowed one of his men to go . Sheppard used a variety of tricks to make his way further into the kingdom , including having a scout follow a group of traders and , most famously , eating so many eggs that the townspeople could no longer supply him and his scout was able to gain access to the next village to find more eggs . Eventually , however , he encountered villagers that would allow him to go no further . While Sheppard was formulating a plan , the king 's son , Prince N <unk> , arrived and arrested Sheppard and his men for trespassing . 
 King Kot aMweeky , rather than executing Sheppard , told the village that Sheppard was his deceased son . King aMweeky declared Sheppard " <unk> <unk> " , which spared the lives of Sheppard and his men . This was a political move on the part of the king ; in danger of being overthrown , he encouraged interest in the strangers to direct attention away from himself . During his stay in the village , Sheppard collected artifacts from the people and he eventually secured permission for a Presbyterian mission . The king allowed him to leave on the condition that he return in one year . He would be unable to do so for several years , however , by which time Kot aMweeky had been overthrown by <unk> , the leader of a rival clan . 
 = = Documentation of Belgian atrocities = = 
 In the late nineteenth century , King Leopold II started to receive criticism for his treatment of the natives in Congo Free State . In the United States , the main outlet of this criticism was the Presbyterian church . In 1891 , Sheppard became involved with William Morrison after Lapsley 's death . They would report the crimes they saw , and later , with the help of Roger Casement , would form the Congo Reform Association ( CRA ) , one of the world 's first humanitarian organizations . 
 In January 1900 the New York Times published a report that said fourteen villages had been burned and ninety or more of the local people killed in the Bena Kamba country by Zappo Zap warriors sent to collect taxes by the Congo Free State administration . The report was based on letters from Southern Presbyterian missionaries Rev. L. C. Vass and Rev. H. P. Hawkins stationed at <unk> and the subsequent investigation by Sheppard who visited to the Zappo Zaps 's camp . Apparently taken for a government official , he was openly shown the bodies of many of the victims . Sheppard saw evidence of cannibalism . He counted eighty @-@ one right hands that had been cut off and were being dried before being taken to show the State officers what the Zappo Zaps had achieved . He found sixty women confined in a pen . The massacre caused an uproar against Dufour and the Congo Free State itself . When Mark Twain published his King Leopold 's Soliloquy five years later , he mentioned Sheppard by name and referred to his account of the massacre . 
 In January 1908 , Sheppard published a report on colonial abuses in the American Presbyterian Congo Mission ( <unk> ) newsletter , and both he and Morrison were sued for libel against the Kasai Rubber Company ( Compagnie de Kasai ) , a prominent Belgian rubber contractor in the area . When the case went to court in September 1909 , the two missionaries had support from the CRA , American Progressives , and their lawyer , Emile Vandervelde , a prominent Belgian socialist . The judge acquitted Sheppard ( Morrison had been acquitted earlier on a technicality ) on the premise that his editorial had not named the major company , but smaller charter companies instead . However , it is likely that the case was decided in favor of Sheppard as a result of international politics ; the U.S. , socially in support of the missionaries , had questioned the validity of King Leopold II 's rule over the Congo . 
 Sheppard 's reports often portrayed actions by the State that broke laws set by the European nations . Many of the documented cases of cruelty or violence were in direct violation of the Berlin Act of 1885 , which gave Leopold II control over the Congo as long as he " care [ d ] for the improvements of their conditions of their moral and material well @-@ being " and " help [ ed ] in suppressing slavery . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Sheppard 's efforts contributed to the contemporary debate on European colonialism and imperialism in the region , particularly amongst the African American community . However , historians have noted that he has traditionally received little recognition for his contributions . 
 Over the course of his journeys , Sheppard amassed a sizable collection of Kuba art , much of which he donated to his alma mater , Hampton University , which has his art on display at the Hampton University Museum . He was possibly the first African American collector of African art . This art collection was notable because it " acquired the art objects in Africa , from Africans at all levels in their society ... in the context of their daily existence " and , as a whole , Kuba art is considered " one of the most highly developed of African visual art forms ... " The collection as a whole is quite large ; from the time of his arrival to Congo Free State in 1890 until his final departure 20 years later in 1910 , Sheppard was collecting art and artifacts from the cultures around him . 
 Sheppard 's collection was also useful to ethnologists of the time , because the Kuba culture was not well known by the outside world , or even by those well @-@ versed with African studies . For example , the collection does not feature a large number of carved human figures or any figurine that could be connected to a deity of some sort . This could be taken as evidence that the Kuba had no religion , or had one that was not outwardly expressed through art . On the issue of the collection 's scientific value , Jane E. Davis of the Southern Workman journal wrote that " it not only meets the requirements of the ethnologists , but those of the artist as well . Already it has been used by scientists to establish the origins of the culture of the <unk> tribe " .

 = Conwy Castle = 
 Conwy Castle ( Welsh : Castell Conwy , English : Conway Castle ) is a medieval fortification in Conwy , on the north coast of Wales . It was built by Edward I , during his conquest of Wales , between 1283 and 1289 . Constructed as part of a wider project to create the walled town of Conwy , the combined defences cost around £ 15 @,@ 000 , a huge sum for the period . Over the next few centuries , the castle played an important part in several wars . It withstood the siege of Madog ap Llywelyn in the winter of 1294 – 95 , acted as a temporary haven for Richard II in 1399 and was held for several months by forces loyal to Owain Glyndŵr in 1401 . 
 Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 , the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I , holding out until 1646 when it surrendered to the Parliamentary armies . In the aftermath the castle was partially slighted by Parliament to prevent it being used in any further revolt , and was finally completely ruined in 1665 when its remaining iron and lead was stripped and sold off . Conwy Castle became an attractive destination for painters in the late 18th and early 19th centuries . Visitor numbers grew and initial restoration work was carried out in the second half of the 19th century . In the 21st century the ruined castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist attraction . 
 UNESCO considers Conwy to be one of " the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe " , and it is classed as a World Heritage site . The rectangular castle is built from local and imported stone and occupies a coastal ridge , originally overlooking an important crossing point over the River Conwy . Divided into an Inner and an Outer Ward , it is defended by eight large towers and two barbicans , with a postern gate leading down to the river , allowing the castle to be resupplied from the sea . It retains the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain and what historian Jeremy Ashbee has described as the " best preserved suite of medieval private royal chambers in England and Wales " . In keeping with other Edwardian castles in North Wales , the architecture of Conwy has close links to that found in the kingdom of Savoy during the same period , an influence probably derived from the Savoy origins of the main architect , James of Saint George .

 = = = 13th century = = = 
 Before the English built the town of Conwy , Aberconwy Abbey , the site was occupied by a Cistercian monastery favoured by the Welsh princes . The location also controlled an important crossing point over the River Conwy between the coastal and inland areas of North Wales , that Deganwy Castle for many years had defended . The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied for control of the region since the 1070s and the conflict had resumed during the 13th century , leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales for the second time during his reign in 1282 . 
 Edward invaded with a huge army , pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester . Edward captured Aberconwy in March 1283 and decided that the location would form the centre of a new county : he would relocate the abbey eight miles up the Conwy valley to a new site at Maenan , establishing Maenan Abbey , and build a new English castle and walled town on the monastery 's former site . The ruined castle of Deganwy was abandoned and never rebuilt . Edward 's plan was a colonial enterprise and placing the new town and walls on top of such a high @-@ status native Welsh site was in part a symbolic act to demonstrate English power . 
 Work began on cutting the ditch around Conwy Castle within days of Edward 's decision . The work was controlled by Sir John Bonvillars and overseen by master mason James of St. George , and the first phase of work between 1283 and 1284 focused on creating the exterior curtain walls and towers . In the second phase , from 1284 and 1286 , the interior buildings were erected , while work began on the walls for the neighbouring town . By 1287 , the castle was complete . The builders recruited huge numbers of labourers from across England for the task . At each summer building season the labourers massed at Chester and then walked into Wales . Edward 's accountants did not separate the costs of the town walls from that of the castle , but the total cost of the two projects came to around £ 15 @,@ 000 , a huge sum for the period . 
 The castle 's constable was , by a royal charter of 1284 , also the mayor of the new town of Conwy , and oversaw a castle garrison of 30 soldiers , including 15 crossbowmen , supported by a carpenter , chaplain , blacksmith , engineer and a stonemason . In 1294 Madog ap Llywelyn rebelled against English rule . Edward was besieged at Conwy by the Welsh between December and January 1295 , supplied only by sea , before forces arrived to relieve him in February . Chronicler Walter of Guisborough suggested that given the austere conditions Edward refused to drink his own private supply of wine , and instead had it shared out amongst the garrison . For some years afterwards , the castle formed the main residence for visiting senior figures , and hosted Edward 's son , the future Edward II in 1301 when he visited the region to receive homage from the Welsh leaders .

 Conwy Castle was not well maintained during the early 14th century and by 1321 a survey reported it was poorly equipped , with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers . These problems persisted until Edward , the Black Prince took over control of the castle in 1343 . Sir John Weston , his chamberlain , conducted repairs , building new stone support arches for the great hall and other parts of the castle . After the death of the Black Prince , however , Conwy fell into neglect again . 
 At the end of the 14th century , the castle was used as a refuge by Richard II from the forces of his rival , Henry Bolingbroke . On 12 August 1399 , after returning from Ireland , Richard made his way to the castle where he met Bolingbroke 's emissary , Henry Percy , for negotiations . Percy swore in the chapel he would not harm the king . On 19 August , Richard surrendered to Percy at Flint Castle , promising to abdicate if his life were spared . The king was then taken to London , he died later in captivity at Pontefract Castle . 
 Henry Bolingbroke took the English throne to rule as Henry IV in 1400 , but rebellion broke out in North Wales shortly afterwards under the leadership of Owain Glyndŵr . In March 1401 , Rhys ap Tudur and his brother Gwilym , cousins of Owain Glyndŵr , undertook a surprise attack on Conwy Castle . Pretending to be carpenters repairing the castle , the two gained entry , killed the two watchmen on duty and took control of the fortress . Welsh rebels then attacked and captured the rest of the walled town . The brothers held out for around three months , before negotiating a surrender ; as part of this agreement the pair were given a royal pardon by Henry . 
 During the War of the Roses between 1455 and 1485 , fought by the rival factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists , Conwy was reinforced , but played little part in the fighting . Henry VIII conducted restoration work in the 1520s and 1530s , during which time the castle was being used as a prison , a depot and as a potential residence for visitors .

 Conwy Castle fell into disrepair again by the early 17th century . Charles I sold it to Edward Conway in 1627 for £ 100 , and Edward 's son , also called Edward , inherited the ruin in 1631 . In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Charles ' royalist supporters and Parliament . John Williams , the Archbishop of York , took charge of the castle on behalf of the king , and set about repairing and garrisoning it at his own expense . In 1645 , Sir John Owen was appointed governor of the castle instead , however , leading to a bitter dispute between the two men . The Archbishop defected to Parliament , the town of Conwy fell in August 1646 and in November General Thomas Mytton finally took the castle itself after a substantial siege . 
 In the aftermath of the siege , Colonel John Carter was appointed governor of the castle and fresh repairs were carried out . In 1655 the Council of State appointed by Parliament ordered the castle to be slighted , or put beyond military use : the Bakehouse tower was probably deliberately partially pulled down at this time as part of the slighting . With the restoration of Charles II in 1660 , Conway was returned to Edward Conway , the Earl of Conway , but five years later Edward decided to strip the remaining iron and lead from the castle and sell it off . The work was completed under the supervision of Edward Conway 's overseer William Milward , despite opposition from the leading citizens of Conwy , and turned the castle into a total ruin . 
 By the end of the 18th century , the ruins were considered picturesque and sublime , attracting visitors and artists , and paintings of the castle were made by Thomas Girtin , Moses Griffith , Julius Caesar Ibbetson , Paul Sandby and J. M. W. Turner . Several bridges were built across the River Conwy linking the town and Llandudno during the 19th century , including a road bridge in 1826 and a rail bridge in 1848 . These improved communication links with the castle and further increased tourist numbers . In 1865 Conwy Castle passed from the Holland family , who had leased it from the descendants of the Conways , to the civic leadership of Conwy town . Restoration work on the ruins then began , including the reconstruction of the damaged Bakehouse tower . In 1953 the castle was leased to the Ministry of Works and Arnold Taylor undertook a wide range of repairs and extensive research into the castle 's history . An additional road bridge was built to the castle in 1958 . Already protected as a scheduled monument , in 1986 it was also declared part of the World Heritage Site of the " Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd " . 
 In the 21st century the castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist attraction and 186 @,@ 897 tourists visited the castle in 2010 ; a new visitor centre was opened in 2012 . The castle requires ongoing maintenance and repairs cost £ 30 @,@ 000 over the 2002 – 03 financial year .
