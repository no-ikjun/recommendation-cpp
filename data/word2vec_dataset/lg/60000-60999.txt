 Although the Machecoul massacre , and others that followed it , are often viewed ( variously ) as a royalist revolt , or a counter @-@ revolution , twenty @-@ first century historians generally agree that Vendee revolt was a complicated popular event brought on by anti @-@ clericalism of the Revolution , mass conscription , and Jacobin anti @-@ federalism . In the geographic area south of the Loire , resistance to recruitment was particularly intense , and much of this area also resented intrusion by partisans of the republic , called " blue coats " , who brought with them new ideas about district and judicial organization , and who required reorganization of parishes with the so @-@ called juring priests ( those who had taken the civil oath ) . Consequently , the insurgency became a combination of many impulses , at which conscription and the organization of parishes led the list . The response to it was incredibly violent on both sides . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1791 , two representatives on mission informed the National Convention of the disquieting condition of Vendée , and this news was quickly followed by the exposure of a royalist plot organized by the Marquis de la <unk> . It was not until the social unrest combined with the external pressures from the Civil Constitution of the Clergy ( 1790 ) and the introduction of a levy of 300 @,@ 000 on the whole of France , decreed by the National Convention in February 1793 , that the region erupted . 
 The Civil Constitution of the Clergy required all clerics to swear allegiance to it and , by extension , to the increasingly anti @-@ clerical National Constituent Assembly . All but seven of the 160 French bishops refused the oath , as did about half of the parish priests . Persecution of the clergy and of the faithful was the first trigger of the rebellion . Those who refused the oath , called non @-@ juring priests , had been exiled or imprisoned . Women on their way to Mass were beaten in the streets . Religious orders had been suppressed and Church property , confiscated . On 3 March 1793 , most of the churches were ordered closed . Soldiers confiscated sacramental vessels and the people were forbidden to place crosses on graves . 
 Nearly all the purchasers of church land were bourgeois ; very few peasants benefited from the sales . To add to this insult , on 23 February 1793 the Convention required the raising of an additional 300 @,@ 000 troops from the provinces , an act which enraged the populace , who took up arms instead as The Catholic Army ; the term " Royal " was added later . This army fought first and foremost for the reopening of parish churches with the former priests . 
 In March 1793 , as word of the conscription requirements filtered into the countryside , many <unk> refused to satisfy the decree of the levee en masse issued on 23 February 1793 . Within weeks the rebel forces had formed a substantial , if ill @-@ equipped , army , the Royal and Catholic Army , supported by two thousand irregular cavalry and a few captured artillery pieces . Most of the insurgents operated on a much smaller scale , using guerrilla tactics , supported by the local knowledge and the good @-@ will of the people . 
 = = Massacre = = 
 The irregular army raised in the countryside had not reached Machecoul , but the officials from the conscription officers had . On Monday , 11 March 1793 , a crowd arrived in the center of the town , from the surrounding countryside ; they started the chant Pas de <unk> ( no enlistments ) and surrounded the Republic 's conscription officers in the town . A nervous soldier opened fire and the enraged crowd retaliated . Between 22 and 26 soldiers were killed , including their lieutenant , Pierre @-@ Claude Ferré . The immediate victims also included the juring priest , Pierre Letort , who was bayoneted to death and whose body was mutilated , <unk> the magistrate , and Étienne <unk> , the principal of the college . The National Guard was routed , and the rebels , including many women , seized those they called " patriots " — also called the " Blues " , or the people who supported the republican cause — and led them to prison in the old castle and the convent of Sisters of Cavalry . There they killed the guardsmen and some notable inhabitants , about 20 in total , although according to some testimony , as many as 26 were killed on the first day and 18 the next day . Alfred <unk> , another witness , gave 22 as the count of dead . 
 The situation then spiraled out of control . In the following days , the insurgents swelled to some six thousand men and women , and some of the republican adherents and their families fled to Nantes and other strongholds . On 19 March , many counter @-@ revolutionary suspects were rounded up and the republicans inflicted their own massacres : in La Rochelle , six non @-@ juring priests were hacked to death and their heads ( and other body parts ) shown throughout the city . About a week later , the insurgents from Machecoul seized the neighboring harbor town of Pornic ( approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) to the northwest ) on 23 March , this time joined by some of the irregular army that had been forming elsewhere , and sacked it . A republican patrol surprised the <unk> , who were carousing on liberated cellars , and killed between 200 and 500 of them . The angry peasants returned to Machecoul and in reprisal killed another dozen prisoners on 27 March . In total , about 200 died ( not all in the battle ) , and when the survivors of Pornic returned to Machecoul , they pulled the detained " blue coats " out of the prisoner and shot them , a process that lasted over the next few weeks , into mid @-@ April . 
 Tales of brutality , some of which may have been true , abounded ; numbers of those killed escalated . Current research suggests that 150 were executed in the town overall , but contemporary republican reports put the figure at 500 . Despite the demonization of the insurgents , though , twenty @-@ two " blue coats " from the parish were saved by the request of their own neighborhoods ; others were even cleared by tribunals established to monitor executions , and overseen by the local jurist , René François Souchu . Souchu , a lawyer and judge by profession , directed the execution of approximately 50 republican officials and adherents on 3 April ; they were shot down and buried in a field outside of the city . 
 = = = Contemporary reports = = = 
 The most influential of the contemporary reports came from Citizen Boullemer , and was published in over 1000 pamphlets later in the year . Boullemer claimed to be among the few surviving eyewitnesses : " there arrived from all exits of the city , five to six thousand peasants , women and children , armed [ with ] guns , scythes , knives , shovels and pikes . They shouted , running the streets : peace ! peace ! " Boullemer 's account continues : they descended on Machecoul , confronted a detachment of the National guard that had come to enforce the levy . One hundred National Guardsmen and police defended the town against them . Louis @-@ Charles @-@ César Maupassant , a farmer , merchant and a deputy to the Convention , tried to harangue the attackers into quiescence , but could not be heard above the din . Most of the Republican troops and officials scattered before the threatening crowd . According to Louis Mortimer @-@ <unk> , another eye @-@ witness , only three officers and five or six gendarmes remained at their posts . At that time , according to him , some national guardsmen who had tried to escape through an alley were ambushed by peasants , pursued , and finally brought down by the crowd at the feet of the deputy , Maupassant . The crowd then pulled him off his horse and killed him with a stroke of a shovel . 
 Boullemer 's wrote his sensational account well after the fact , in the safety of Rennes , where he was taken after being rescued by republican forces . Boullemer admitted that he had spent most of the six weeks of the upheaval at Machecoul in the safety of his granary , hiding from the peasants . His account of the terror , though lost nothing in the fact that he had seen little : the peasants in the town sounded the <unk> , he wrote , and others exploded from the surrounding fields . Within a short time the entire affair had become a wholesale massacre of republican troops , the constitutional priest , known radical sympathizers and anyone involved with the municipal administration . Prisoners had their hands tied behind their backs , and were linked with a rope passed under their armpits , in a so @-@ called rosary ; then they were dragged into fields and forced to dig their own graves before being gunned down . Patriots , those who supported the revolution , were hunted down , lashed to trees , and emasculated . Patriot women were raped and cut down in orchards . Boullemer placed the count of the dead at 552 . 
 = = View from Paris = = 
 From the Jacobin clubs , the Convention , and the streets and alleyways in Paris , this could only be viewed as insurrection . For them , the Revolution meant a France indivisible . Anything that divided France — anything that varied from the path set the revolutionary government — was dangerous to the success for the revolution itself . Any idea , an action , or thought that ran counter to the revolutionary ideology smacked of federalism or , worse , of royalist sentiment . The historians ' debate over federalism and the French Revolution reaches almost to the days of the Revolution itself . To be called a " federalist " in 1793 , 1794 , or 1795 , or any other time in the revolution , for that matter , was tantamount to being labeled as an anti @-@ revolutionary ; to be called anti @-@ revolutionary meant one was de facto a royalist . It was a convenient epithet : to be called a federalist alienated one from the principal radical goal of the revolution , which was to create a single , unified French Republic . Any notion of sectionalism — the possibility that a department or departments could establish for themselves a set of conditions and a government — must be labeled as anti @-@ revolutionary . For the moderate Girondins and the radical Montagnards , federalism meant the watering @-@ down of the Revolution , the violation of the civic body , and the loss of their dreams . If the peasants of the Vendée did not want to fight for the Revolution , if they preferred their priests and their ( dead ) king to their liberty , then they must be against the Revolution and , consequently , they must be severed from its benefits . 
 This uncompromising vision of revolutionary goals implied a plain and brutal truth : " convert heads or chop them off . " One deputy complained , " if there were only 30 @,@ 000 , it would be a simple matter of putting them all to the sword , but there are so many ! " Boullemer 's written description of the event was published as a pamphlet in November 1793 , and the representative on mission , Jacques Garnier , sent a thousand copies to the Convention , the Executive Council and to all departments ; it also served as a basis for the official report that François Toussaint Villers presented to the Convention . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 There were other levy riots across France , when the departments started to draft men into the army in response to the Levy Decree but reaction in the northwest in March was particularly pronounced with large scale rioting verging on insurrection . By early April , in areas north of the Loire , order had been restored by the revolutionary government , but south of the river , in the four departments that became known as the Vendée Militaire , there were few troops to control rebels and what had started as rioting quickly took on the form of a full insurrection led by priests and the local nobility . 
 Evidence links these events to local dissatisfaction with the reorganization of the church into a government entity . The unrest began half way through Lent ; Easter that year occurred on 31 March 1793 , and , significantly , the initial violence was directed at the local priest Letort . Letort personified the revolution , and the republican government in Paris by taking the Civil Oath of the Clergy , essentially becoming a puppet of the republicans in Paris , at least in the eyes of the insurgents . The violence followed what Raymond Jonas called a singular pattern of logic : it targeted those who personified the revolution in their function or status : National Guard Lieutenant Ferré , such prominent townsmen as Deputy Maupassant , and the constitutional priest Letort . Yet , the local district administrator , the jurist Souchu , was left alone : apparently he was known for his anti @-@ republican sentiments and actually threw his lot in with the insurgents . After the furor in Machecoul died down later in the spring , the former pastor at Machecoul , the non @-@ juring priest François <unk> , refused to celebrate at the now " liberated " church because the schismatic constitutional priest had profaned it . Instead , he said the Mass outside on a makeshift altar . 
 Class differences were not as great in the Vendée as in Paris or in other French provinces . In the rural Vendée , the local nobility seems to have been more permanently in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France . Alexis de Tocqueville noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789 . An <unk> ' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vendée . Consequently , the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris , for example , were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith . 
 = Ersatz Yorck @-@ class battlecruiser = 
 The Ersatz Yorck class was a group of three battlecruisers ordered for the Imperial German Navy in April 1915 . The name derived from the fact that the lead ship was intended as a replacement ( German : ersatz ) for the armored cruiser Yorck , lost to mines in 1914 . They were a slightly enlarged version of the Mackensen @-@ class battlecruiser , armed with 38 cm ( 15 in ) guns as opposed to the 35 cm ( 13 @.@ 8 in ) weapons on the preceding design . The boilers would have been trunked into a single massive funnel . The three ships were originally ordered as part of the Mackensen class but the design was changed when details of the British Admiral @-@ class battlecruisers became known to German intelligence . The vessels were ordered under the provisional names Ersatz Yorck , Ersatz Gneisenau , and Ersatz Scharnhorst . They were considered to be replacements for the armored cruisers Yorck , which had been sunk by German mines in 1914 , and Gneisenau and Scharnhorst , both of which had been sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands also in 1914 . 
 As with the Mackensens , the three ships of the Ersatz Yorck class were never completed . This was primarily due to shifting wartime construction priorities ; U @-@ boats were deemed more important to Germany 's war effort , and so work on other types of ships was slowed or halted outright . The lead ship , Ersatz Yorck , was the only vessel of the three to have construction begin , though she was over two years from completion by the time work was abandoned . With the hull incomplete , the ship could not be launched and towed to ship @-@ breakers ; as a result , Ersatz Yorck was broken up in situ .

 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Ersatz Yorck @-@ class ships were an enlargement of the previous Mackensen @-@ class ships . They were 227 @.@ 80 m ( 747 ft 5 in ) long , compared to 223 m ( 731 ft 8 in ) on the earlier vessels . Ersatz Yorck had the same beam as the earlier vessels , at 30 @.@ 40 m ( 99 ft 9 in ) , and the same draft of 9 @.@ 30 m ( 30 ft 6 in ) . The ships were planned to displace 33 @,@ 500 tonnes ( 33 @,@ 000 long tons ) at standard weight , and up to 38 @,@ 000 t ( 37 @,@ 000 long tons ) fully laden . This was approximately 2 @,@ 500 t ( 2 @,@ 500 long tons ) heavier than the Mackensens . The Ersatz Yorck @-@ class ships ' hulls were to have been constructed with longitudinal steel frames with the outer plating riveted on . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 As with all German battlecruisers that had been built , the Ersatz Yorck @-@ class ships would have been equipped with four sets of Parsons turbine engines , each of which drove a 3 @-@ bladed screw that was 4 @.@ 20 m ( 13 ft 9 in ) in diameter . The turbines were supplied with steam by 24 coal @-@ fired Schulz @-@ Thornycroft single ended boilers and 8 oil @-@ fired Schulz @-@ Thornycroft double ended boilers . Ersatz Yorck and Ersatz Gneisenau were intended to use Föttinger fluid transmission for their turbines , while Ersatz Scharnhorst 's turbines retained direct coupled geared transmissions . The ships were to have electrical power provided by diesel generators . The Ersatz <unk> were intended to mount a pair of twin rudders alongside each other for steering . 
 The power plant was rated 90 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower and 295 revolutions per minute , the same as the preceding Mackensen @-@ class ships . Their slightly greater size reduced their speed somewhat , from 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) in the Mackensen @-@ class ships to 27 @.@ 3 knots ( 50 @.@ 6 km / h ; 31 @.@ 4 mph ) for the new vessels . The ships were designed to store 850 t ( 840 long tons ) of coal and 250 t ( 250 long tons ) of oil in purpose @-@ designed fuel bunkers . However , the areas of the hull between the torpedo bulkhead and the outer wall of the ship were also used for fuel storage . This additional space provided an increased total of 4 @,@ 000 t ( 3 @,@ 900 long tons ) of coal and 2 @,@ 000 t ( 2 @,@ 000 long tons ) of oil . With fuel stores topped off , the ships were estimated to have been able to steam for 5 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 200 km ; 6 @,@ 300 mi ) at a cruising speed of 14 kn ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships ' main battery was to have consisted of eight 38 cm ( 15 in ) SK L / 45 guns in four Drh LC / 1913 twin gun turrets , placed in superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure . These were the same " Langer Max " guns as those mounted on the Bayern @-@ class battleships . The guns could initially depress to − 8 degrees and elevate to 16 degrees ; this provided maximum range of 20 @,@ 400 m . The gun mountings were modified to allow elevation up to 20 degrees ; the range was correspondingly increased to 23 @,@ 200 m . The turrets could train 150 degrees to either side of the centerline . The main battery was supplied with a total of 720 shells or 90 rounds per gun . The guns had a rate of fire of around 2 @.@ 5 shells per minute . Post @-@ war tests conducted by the British Royal Navy showed that the guns on the battleship Baden could be ready to fire again 23 seconds after firing ; this was significantly faster than their British contemporaries , the 38 cm guns on the Renown class , which took 36 seconds between salvos . The guns fired 750 kg ( 1 @,@ 650 lb ) armor @-@ piercing shells with a 277 kg ( 610 lb ) RPC / 12 propellant charge in a brass cartridge . The shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of 800 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 625 fps ) . Each gun was expected to fire 300 shells before replacement was required . 
 The ships ' secondary battery consisted of twelve 15 cm SK L / 45 quick @-@ firing guns mounted in armored casemates along the central superstructure . Each gun was supplied with 160 rounds , and had a maximum range of 13 @,@ 500 m , though this was later extended to 16 @,@ 800 m . The guns had a sustained rate of fire of 5 to 7 rounds per minute . The shells were 45 @.@ 3 kg ( 100 lb ) , and were loaded with a 13 @.@ 7 kg ( 30 lb ) RPC / 12 propellant charge in a brass cartridge . The guns fired at a muzzle velocity of 835 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 740 ft / s ) . The guns were expected to fire around 1 @,@ 400 shells before they needed to be replaced . 
 The ships were also armed with eight 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) L / 45 Flak guns in single pedestal mounts . Four were arranged around the rear superfiring main battery turret and the other four around the forward conning tower . The Flak guns were emplaced in MPL C / 13 mountings , which allowed depression to − 10 degrees and elevation to 70 degrees . These guns fired 9 kg ( 20 lb ) shells , and had an effective ceiling of 9 @,@ 150 m at 70 degrees . 
 As was standard for warships of the period , the Ersatz <unk> were equipped with submerged torpedo tubes . There were three 60 cm ( 24 in ) tubes : one in the bow , and one on each flank of the ship . The torpedoes were the H8 type , which were 8 m long and carried a 210 kg ( 460 lb ) Hexanite warhead . The torpedoes had a range of 6 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 yd ) when set at a speed of 36 knots ; at a reduced speed of 30 knots , the range increased significantly to 14 @,@ 000 m ( 15 @,@ 300 yd ) . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The Ersatz Yorck @-@ class ships were protected with Krupp cemented steel armor , as was the standard for German warships of the period . The armor layout was identical to the preceding Mackensen class , which was itself very similar to the armor scheme on the preceding Derfflinger @-@ class ships . They had an armor belt that was 300 mm ( 12 in ) thick in the central citadel of the ship , where the most important parts of the ship were located . This included the ammunition magazines and the machinery spaces . The belt was reduced in less critical areas , to 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) forward and 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) aft . The belt tapered down to 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) at the bow , though the stern was not protected by armor at all . A 45 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) thick torpedo bulkhead ran the length of the hull , several meters behind the main belt . The main armored deck ranged in thickness from 30 mm thick in less important areas , to 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) in the sections that covered the more critical areas of the ship . 
 The forward conning tower was protected with heavy armor : the sides were 300 mm thick and the roof was 130 mm ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) thick . The rear conning tower was less well armored ; its sides were only 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick and the roof was covered with 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) of armor plate . The main battery gun turrets were also heavily armored : the turret sides were 270 mm ( 11 in ) thick and the roofs were 110 mm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) thick . The 15 cm guns had 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) worth of armor plating in the casemates ; the guns themselves had 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) thick shields to protect their crews from shell splinters .

 Three ships were ordered for the new design . Ersatz Yorck , a replacement for the armored cruiser Yorck , was ordered from AG Vulcan in Hamburg , laid down in July 1916 under construction number 63 . After 1917 , work on the ship only took place in order to keep dockyard workers occupied . Construction was suspended to concentrate on the U @-@ boat program , and the hull frames that had been assembled were subsequently scrapped on the slip . Ersatz Gneisenau , a replacement for the armored cruiser Gneisenau , was ordered from Germaniawerft in Kiel under construction number 250 . Work was not started due to shifting priorities , though some material had been constructed . The diesel engines that had been built were subsequently installed on the first four Type U 151 U @-@ boats U @-@ 151 , U @-@ 152 , U @-@ 153 , and U @-@ 154 . Ersatz Scharnhorst , a replacement for the armored cruiser Scharnhorst , was ordered from Blohm + Voss in Hamburg under construction number 246 . Construction never began on her as well , due to shifting priorities . However , the design formed the basis for the Scharnhorst @-@ class battleships built by the Kriegsmarine in the mid @-@ 1930s . 
 = Rameswaram = 
 Rameswaram , ( also spelt as <unk> , Rameshwaram or <unk> ) is a town and a second grade municipality in the Ramanathapuram district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu . It is located on Pamban Island separated from mainland India by the Pamban channel and is about 50 kilometres from Mannar Island , Sri Lanka . It is situated in the Gulf of Mannar , at the very tip of the Indian peninsula . Pamban Island , also known as Rameswaram Island , is connected to mainland India by the Pamban Bridge . Rameswaram is the terminus of the railway line from Chennai and Madurai . Together with Varanasi , it is considered to be one of the holiest places in India to Hindus , and part of the Char Dham pilgrimage . 
 It is said that this is the place from where the Hindu god Rama built a bridge across the sea to Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from her abductor Ravana . The Ramanathaswamy Temple , dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva , is located at the centre of the town and is closely associated with Rama . The temple , along with the town , is considered a holy pilgrimage site for both <unk> and <unk> . 
 Rameswaram is the closest point from which to reach Sri Lanka from India , and geological evidence suggests that the Rama Sethu was a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka . The town has been in the news over the Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project , Kachchatheevu , Sri Lankan Tamil refugees and capturing local fishermen for alleged cross @-@ border activities by Sri Lankan Forces . Rameswaram is administered by a municipality established in 1994 . The town covers an area of 53 km2 and had a population of 44 @,@ 856 as of 2011 . Tourism and fishery employ the majority of workforce in Rameswaram . 
 = = Legend = = 
 <unk> means " Lord of Rama " in Sanskrit , an epithet of Shiva , the presiding deity of the Ramanathaswamy Temple . According to Hindu epic Ramayana , Rama , the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu , prayed to Shiva here to absolve any sins that he might have committed during his war against the demon @-@ king Ravana in Sri Lanka . According to the Puranas ( Hindu scriptures ) , upon the advice of sages , Rama along with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana , installed and worshipped the lingam ( an iconic symbol of Shiva ) here to expiate the sin of Brahmahatya incurred while killing of the Brahmin Ravana . To worship Shiva , Rama wanted to have the largest lingam and directed his monkey lieutenant Hanuman to bring it from Himalayas . Since it took longer to bring the lingam , Sita built a small lingam , which is believed to be the one in the sanctum of the temple . This account is not supported by the original Ramayana authored by Valmiki , nor in the Tamil version of the Ramayana authored by Tamil poet , <unk> ( 1180 – 1250 CE ) . Support for this account is found in some of the later versions of the Ramayana , such as the one penned by <unk> ( 15th century ) . Sethu Karai is a place 22 km before the island of Rameswaram from where Rama is believed to have built a floating stone bridge , the <unk> bridge , that further continued to Dhanushkodi in Rameswaram till Talaimannar in Sri Lanka . According to another version , as quoted in Adhyatma Ramayana , Rama installed the lingam before the construction of the bridge to Lanka . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of Rameswaram is centred around the island being a transit point to reach Sri Lanka ( Ceylon historically ) and the presence of Ramanathaswamy Temple . Tevaram , the 7th – 8th century Tamil compositions on Shiva by the three prominent Nayanars ( Saivites ) namely Appar , Sundarar and Thirugnanasambandar . The Chola king Rajendra Chola I ( 1012 – 1040 CE ) had a control of the town for a short period . The Jaffna kingdom ( 1215 – 1624 CE ) had close connections with the island and claimed the title <unk> meaning custodians of the Rameswaram . Hinduism was their state religion and they made generous contribution to the temple . Setu was used in their coins as well as in inscriptions as marker of the dynasty . 
 According to <unk> , Malik Kafur , the head general of Alauddin Khilji , the ruler of Delhi Sultanate , reached Rameswaram during his political campaign in spite of stiff resistance from the Pandyan princes in the early 14th century . He erected a mosque by name Alia al @-@ Din <unk> in honour of victory of Islam . During the early 15th century , the present day Ramanathapuram , <unk> and Rameswaram were included in the Pandya dynasty . In 1520 CE , the town came under the rule of Vijayanagara Empire . The <unk> , the breakaway from Madurai Nayaks , ruled Ramanathapuram and contributed to the Ramanathaswamy temple . The most notable of them are the contributions of Muthu Kumara Ragunatha and Muthu <unk> Sethupathi , who transformed the temple to an architectural ensemble . The region was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib ( 1740 – 1754 CE ) , Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan ( 1725 – 1764 CE ) in the middle of 18th century . In 1795 CE , Rameswaram came under the direct control of the British East India Company and was annexed to the Madras Presidency . After 1947 , the town became a part of Independent India . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Rameswaram has an average elevation of 10 metres ( 32 feet ) . The island is spread across an area of 61 @.@ 8 square kilometres and is in the shape of a conch . 74 % of the area has sandy soil due to the presence of sea and it has many islands surrounding it , the Palk Strait in the north west and Gulf of Mannar in the south East . The Ramanathaswamy Temple occupies major area of Rameswaram . The beach of Rameswaram is featured with no waves at all – the sea waves rise to a maximum height of 3 cm and the view looks like a very big river . Rameswaram has dry tropical climate with low humidity , with average monthly rainfall of 75 @.@ 73 mm , mostly from North East monsoon from October to January . The highest ever temperature recorded at Pamban station was 37 ° C and the lowest was 17 ° C. 
 <unk> Bridge is a chain of limestone shoals , between Rameswaram and Mannar Island , off the northwestern coast of Sri Lanka . Geological evidence suggests that this bridge is a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka . The bridge is 18 miles ( 30 km ) long and separates the Gulf of Mannar ( north east ) from the Palk Strait ( South West ) . It was reportedly passable on foot up to the 15th century until storms deepened the channel . The temple records record that Rama ’ s Bridge was completely above sea level until it broke in a cyclone in 1480 CE . The bridge was first mentioned in the ancient Indian Sanskrit epic Ramayana of Valmiki . The name Rama 's Bridge or Rama Setu ( Sanskrit ; <unk> : bridge ) refers to the bridge built by the <unk> ( ape men ) army of Rama in Hindu mythology , which he used to reach Lanka and rescue his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana . The Ramayana attributes the building of this bridge to Rama in verse 2 @-@ 22 @-@ 76 , naming it as <unk> . The sea separating India and Sri Lanka is called Sethusamudram meaning " Sea of the Bridge " . Maps prepared by a Dutch cartographer in 1747 CE , available at the Tanjore Saraswathi Mahal Library show this area as <unk> , a colloquial form of the Tamil Raman Kovil ( or Rama 's Temple ) . Many other maps in Schwartzberg 's historical atlas and other sources such as travel texts by Marco Polo call this area by various names such as <unk> and <unk> Rameswaram .

Rameswaram is an industrially backward town – there has been no demarcation for industrial land due to the pilgrim sanctity and ecological fragile geography . Being an island town , the traditional occupation was fishing , but due to poor returns , the people in fishing community have gradually shifted to other professions . Banks such as State Bank of India , Indian Bank and <unk> Bank have their branches in Rameswaram .

 Pamban Bridge is a cantilever bridge on the Palk Strait that connects Rameswaram to mainland India . The railway bridge is 6 @,@ 776 ft ( 2 @,@ 065 m ) and was opened to traffic in 1914 . The railroad bridge is a double @-@ leaf bascule bridge section that can be raised to let ships pass under it . The railway bridge historically carried metre @-@ gauge trains on it , but Indian Railways upgraded the bridge to carry broad @-@ gauge trains in a project that finished on 12 August 2007 . Historically , the two leaves of the bridge were opened manually using levers by workers . About 10 ships – cargo carriers , coast guard ships , fishing vessels and oil tankers pass through the bridge every month . After completion of bridge , metre @-@ gauge lines were laid from Mandapam up to Pamban Station , from where the railway lines bifurcated into two directions , one towards Rameswaram about 6 @.@ 25 miles ( 10 @.@ 06 km ) up and another branch line of 15 miles ( 24 km ) terminating at Dhanushkodi . The noted Boat Mail ran on this track between 1915 and 1964 from Chennai Egmore up to Dhanushkodi , from where the passengers were ferried to Talaimannar in Ceylon . The metre @-@ gauge branch line from Pamban Junction to Dhanushkodi was abandoned after it was destroyed in a cyclone in 1964 . 
 There are daily express trains connecting major cities in Tamil Nadu like Chennai , Madurai , Trichy and Coimbatore . There are weekly express trains connecting Coimbatore , Varanasi and Bhubaneswar . Passenger trains ply from Rameswaram to Madurai and Trichy daily , making railways as the major mode of transportation . The Ramanathapuram – Rameswaram National Highway is the main connecting link from Rameswaram to the mainland . Prior to the 1914 train service linking the mainland with Rameswaram , boats were the only mode of transport to Rameswaram island . 
 The National highway NH 49 connects Madurai to Dhanushkodi , linking major towns like Manamadurai , <unk> , and Ramanathapuram in the Ramanathapuram district . The Rameswaram municipality covers a total road length of 52 km and 20 km of national highway covering about 80 percent of the town . The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation runs daily services connecting various cities to Rameswaram and operates a computerised reservation centre in the municipal bus stand of Rameswaram . 
 Rameswaram is the important port among all the ports in the district , having a ferry service to Talaimannar of Sri Lanka , though not operational throughout the year . Limited foreign trade is conducted with Jaffna , <unk> , Talaimannar and Colombo .

 = = = Ramanathaswamy Temple = = = 
 The Ramanathaswamy Temple is the most notable historic landmark of the town . Located in the centre of town , Ramanathaswamy Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva . The temple is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga shrines , where Shiva is worshipped in the form of a Jyotirlinga meaning " pillar of light " . It is also one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalam temples and is glorified in hymns by the three of the most revered Nayanar saints ( 7th century Saivite saints ) , Appar , Sundarar and <unk> Sambandar . The temple in its current structure was built during the 12th century by Pandya Dynasty . The temple has the longest corridor among all Hindu temples in India . The breadth of these columned corridors varies from 17 to 21 feet with a height of 25 feet . Each pillar is sculpted in Nayak style as in Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple . The contribution of the kings of the Sethupathy dynasty ( 17th century ) to the temple was considerable . Large amount of money was spent during the tenure of <unk> <unk> Pillai towards the restoration of the pagodas which were falling into ruins – the <unk> <unk> or the cloistered precincts of the temple was reconstructed by him . The rulers of Sri Lanka contributed to the temple – Parakrama Bahu ( 1153 – 1186 CE ) was involved in the construction of the sanctum sanctorum of the temple . The eastern tower and shrine of Nataraja were built by <unk> Sethupathy in 1649 CE . The second enclosure is ascribed to Chinna <unk> Sethupathy and his son Ragunatha Thirumalai ( 1500 – 1540 CE ) .

 = = = Hindu Pilgrimage = = = 
 Rameswaram is significant for many Hindus as a pilgrimage to Varanasi is considered to be incomplete without a pilgrimage to Rameswaram . The town along with the Ramanathaswamy temple is one of the holiest Hindu Char Dham ( four divine sites ) sites comprising Badrinath , Puri and Dwarka . Though the origins are not clearly known , the Advaita school of Hinduism established by Sankaracharya , attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer . The four monasteries are located across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are Badrinath Temple at Badrinath in the North , Jagannath Temple at Puri in the East , Dwarakadheesh Temple at Dwarka in the West and Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram in the South . Though ideologically the temples are divided between the sects of Hinduism , namely Saivism and Vaishnavism , the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all Hindu affair . The journey across the four cardinal points in India is considered sacred by Hindus who aspire to visit these temples once in their lifetime . Traditionally the trip starts at the eastern end from Puri , proceeding in clockwise direction in a manner typically followed for <unk> in Hindu temples . The temple is one of the famous pilgrimage sites historically – the Maratha kings who ruled Thanjavur established <unk> or rest houses all through Mayiladuthurai and Rameswaram between 1745 and 1837 CE and donated them to the temple .

 = = = Rameswaram Fishery = = = 
 Being an island , a significant population is involved in fishery traditionally . There have been incremental cases of Rameswaram fishermen allegedly killed or arrested by Sri Lankan navy along the maritime borders of India and Sri Lanka from the time of Sri Lankan civil war during 1983 . In the face of simmering tension after the 1985 January Colombo bound <unk> train attack in which 22 Sri Lankan soldiers and 16 civilians were killed , Rameswaram fishermen dared to venture to seas spelling acute hardship for the 10 @,@ 000 fishermen family . An estimated 381 fishermen have been killed in the sea due to shoot outs from 1983 to 2009 . The Sri Lankan army attributed the killings to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , but the casualty continues even after the end of LTTE in the region . The Tamil Nadu state government has increased the compensation of casualty from the original ₹ 100 @,@ 000 to 500 @,@ 000 ( US $ 1 @,@ 800 to $ 9 @,@ 000 ) . There has not been a single prosecution in any of the 381 killings committed so far from the Indian judiciary . The cases not being filed is attributed to the fact that people killed beyond the maritime boundary of India are not eligible for compensation and not many file complaints against the Sri Lankan navy . Though the Indian judiciary has provisions to prosecute foreigners , there is little progress due to the diplomatic overheads involved . Indian government has also ventured into the use of technology like use of Global positioning system ( GPS ) by the fishermen and enabling cellphone blips to alert their mobile phones whenever they are crossing into Sri Lankan waters . The Sri Lankan navy has confirmed reports on Indian fishermen risking the international boundary due to depleted catch in Indian waters . 
 There is a yearly 45 @-@ day ban on fishery with motorboats in the region . The fishing ban for the year 2012 was effective during the months of April – May . The jetty at Rameswaram is the largest landing centre for fishing boats in the region and it usually comes alive after the ban , with the arrival of fishermen , boat captains , shore workers and others from their native places .

 Another focal point on the simmering tension between Indian and Sri Lankan governments is over the use of Kachchatheevu , an uninhabited island 15 km north of Rameswaram , belonging to Sri Lanka . The accord of 1974 allows fishermen of both the countries for resting and soaking the nets in the island . Repeated allegations on attacks by the Lankan navy , which on many occasions killed Indian fishermen , prevented them from making it to the island . The annual two @-@ day Saint Anthony fest at the island draws huge number of people from the fishermen community of both the countries . The number of pilgrims for the 2012 function crossed 4 @,@ 000 , the largest attendance in the past two decades . The feast also provides an opportunity for the Indian fishermen to meet their Sri Lankan counterparts and exchange views on their mutual problems . The event served as a meeting point to find brides and grooms from both countries , but this practice has now been stopped from the 90s due to political constraint of fishermen family living in different countries .

A few organisations are opposing the dredging of <unk> on religious , environmental and economical grounds . Many of these parties and organisations support implementation of this project using one of the five alternative alignments considered earlier without damaging the structure considered sacred by Hindus . With 22 km of dredging remaining , the project is held from March 2010 by a Supreme Court order seeking the Central Government to clarify the status of the bridge as a national monument . 
 = Archaeoraptor = 
 " Archaeoraptor " is the informal generic name for a fossil from China in an article published in National Geographic magazine in 1999 . The magazine claimed that the fossil was a " missing link " between birds and terrestrial theropod dinosaurs . Even prior to this publication there had been severe doubts about the fossil 's authenticity . Further scientific study showed it to be a forgery constructed from rearranged pieces of real fossils from different species . Zhou et al. found that the head and upper body actually belong to a specimen of the primitive fossil bird Yanornis . A 2002 study found that the tail belongs to a small winged dromaeosaur , Microraptor , named in 2000 . The legs and feet belong to an as yet unknown animal . 
 The scandal brought attention to illegal fossil deals conducted in China . Although " Archaeoraptor " was a forgery , many true examples of feathered dinosaurs have been found and demonstrate the evolutionary connection between birds and other theropods . 
 = = Scandal = = 
 " Archaeoraptor " was unveiled at a press conference held by National Geographic magazine in October 1999 . At the same press conference , plans were announced to return the fossil to Chinese authorities , as it was illegally exported . In November 1999 National Geographic featured the fossil in an article written by art editor Christopher Sloan . The article in general discussed feathered dinosaurs and the origin of birds . It claimed the fossil was " a missing link between terrestrial dinosaurs and birds that could actually fly " and informally referred to it as " Archaeoraptor liaoningensis " , announcing it would later be formally named as such . This name means " ancient robber of Liaoning " . This drew immediate criticism from Storrs L. Olson , Curator of Birds at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C. Writing in Backbone , the newsletter of his museum , he denounced the publication of a scientific name in a popular journal , without peer review , as a " nightmare " . 
 On February 3 , 2000 , National Geographic issued a press release stating that the fossil could be a composite , and that an internal investigation had begun . In that same month Bill Allen , National Geographic editor , told Nature that he was " furious " to learn that the fossil might have been faked . In the March issue , in the forum section , a letter from Dr. Xu Xing pointed out that the tail section probably did not match the upper body . In October 2000 National Geographic published the results of their investigation , in an article written by Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning investigative journalist Lewis M. Simons . Simons concluded that the fossil was a composite and that virtually everyone involved in the project had made some mistakes . 
 = = = Chronology = = = 
 According to National Geographic 's report , the story of " Archaeoraptor " begins in July 1997 in <unk> , China , where farmers routinely dug in the shale pits with picks and sold fossils to dealers for a few dollars . This was an illegal practice , but it was common then . In this case one farmer found a rare fossil of a toothed bird , complete with feather impressions . The fossil broke into pieces during collection . Nearby , in the same pit , he found pieces including a feathered tail and legs . He cemented several of these pieces together in a manner that he believed was correct . He apparently knew that it would make a more complete @-@ looking and , thus , more expensive fossil . It was sold in June 1998 to an anonymous dealer and smuggled to the United States . According to authorities in Beijing , no fossils may leave China legally . 
 By the fall 1998 annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology , held in Utah , United States , rumors were circulating about a striking fossil of a primitive bird that was in private hands . This fossil was presented by an anonymous dealer at a gem show in Tucson , Arizona . The Dinosaur Museum in Blanding , Utah , purchased it in February 1999 . The museum is run by Stephen A. Czerkas and his wife , Sylvia Czerkas . Mr. Czerkas does not hold a university degree , but he is a dinosaur enthusiast and artist . He arranged for patrons of his museum , including trustee Dale Slade , to provide $ 80 @,@ 000 for the purchase of the fossil , in order to study it scientifically and prevent it from disappearing into an anonymous private collection . 
 The Czerkases contacted paleontologist Phil Currie , who contacted the National Geographic Society . Currie agreed to study the fossil on condition that it was eventually returned to China . The National Geographic Society intended to get the fossil formally published in the peer @-@ reviewed science journal Nature , and then follow up immediately with a press conference and an issue of National Geographic . Editor Bill Allen asked that all members of the project keep the fossil secret , so that the magazine would have a scoop on the story . 
 Slade and the Czerkases intended the fossil to be the " crown jewel " of the Dinosaur Museum and planned to keep it on display there for five years . Sloan says that he flew to Utah in the spring of 1999 to convince Stephen Czerkas to return the fossil to China immediately after publication , or he would not write about it for National Geographic and Currie would not work on it . Czerkas then agreed . Currie then contacted the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing , and National Geographic flew the IVPP 's Xu Xing to Utah to be part of the " Archaeoraptor " team . 
 During the initial examination of the fossil on March 6 , 1999 it had already become clear to Currie that the left and right feet mirrored each other perfectly and that the fossil had been completed by using both slab and counterslab . He also noticed no connection could be seen between the tail and the body . In July 1999 , Currie and the Czerkases brought the fossil to the High @-@ Resolution X @-@ ray CT Facility of the University of Texas ( Austin ) founded and operated by Dr. Timothy Rowe to make CT scans . Rowe , having made the scans on July 29 , determined that they indicated that the bottom fragments , showing the tail and the lower legs , were not part of the larger fossil . He informed the Czerkases on August 2 that there was a chance of the whole being a fraud . During a subsequent discussion Rowe and Currie were pressured by the Czerkases to keep their reservations private . 
 Currie in the first week of September sent his <unk> , Kevin <unk> , to the Dinosaur Museum in Blanding to prepare the fossil for better study . <unk> concluded that the fossil was " a composite specimen of at least 3 specimens ... with a maximum ... of five ... separate specimens " , but the Czerkases angrily denied this and <unk> only reported this to Currie . Currie did not inform National Geographic of these problems . 
 On August 13 , 1999 , the team submitted a manuscript titled " A New Toothed Bird With a <unk> @-@ like Tail " under the names of Stephen Czerkas , Currie , Rowe , and Xu , to the journal Nature in London . The paper mentions in two places , and includes a figure illustrating the point that , one of the legs and the tail are counterparts that were composited into the main slab . 
 On August 20 Nature rejected the paper , indicating to the Czerkases that National Geographic had refused to delay publication , leaving too little time for peer review . The authors then submitted the paper to Science , which sent it out for peer review . Two reviewers informed Science that " the specimen was smuggled out of China and illegally purchased " and that the fossil had been " doctored " in China " to enhance its value . " Science then rejected the paper . According to Sloan , the Czerkases did not inform National Geographic about the details of the two rejections . 
 By that time the November issue of National Geographic was already in preparation for printing , but " Archaeoraptor " was never formally published in any peer @-@ reviewed journal . 
 National Geographic went ahead and published without peer review . The fossil was unveiled in a press conference on October 15 , 1999 , and the November 1999 National Geographic contained an article by Christopher P. Sloan — a National Geographic art editor . Sloan described it as a missing link that helped elucidate the connection between dinosaurs and birds . The original fossil was put on display at the National Geographic Society in Washington , DC , pending return to China . In the article Sloan used the name " Archaeoraptor liaoningensis " but with a disclaimer ( so that it would not count as a nomenclatural act for the purposes of scientific classification ) in anticipation of Czerkas being able to publish a peer @-@ reviewed description at some point in the future . 
 After the November National Geographic came out , Storrs L. Olson , curator of birds in the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution published an open letter on 1 November 1999 , pointing out that " the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported " and protesting the " prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs . " Olson complained that Sloan , a journalist , had usurped the process of scientific nomenclature by publishing a name first in the popular press : " This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists — that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist . " 
 In October 1999 , after having been informed by Currie of the problems and seeing the specimen for the first time , Xu noticed that the tail of " Archaeoraptor " strongly resembled an unnamed maniraptoran dinosaur that he was studying — later to be named Microraptor <unk> . He returned to China and traveled to Liaoning Province where he inspected the fossil site and contacted a number of fossil dealers . He eventually found a fairly complete fossil of a tiny dromaeosaur , and the tail of this new fossil corresponded so exactly to the tail on the " Archaeoraptor " fossil that it had to be the counterslab — it even had two matching yellow oxide stains . On December 20 , 1999 Xu Xing sent e @-@ mails to the authors and Sloan , announcing that the fossil was a fake . 
 On February 3 , 2000 The National Geographic News issued a press release stating that the " Archaeoraptor " fossil might be a composite , and that an internal investigation had begun . In the March issue of National Geographic Xu 's letter ran in the Forum section of the magazine , and Bill Allen had Xu change the word " fake " to " composite " . 
 On April 4 , 2000 Stephen Czerkas told a group of paleontologists in Washington that he and Sylvia had made " an idiot , bone @-@ stupid mistake " . Currie , Allen and Sloan all expressed regret . Rowe felt vindicated , claiming the affair as evidence that his scans were correct . Rowe published a Brief Communication in Nature in 2001 describing his findings . He concluded that , apart from the top part , several specimens had been used to complete the fossil : a first for the left femur , a second for the tibiae , a third for both feet and at least one more for the tail , which alone consisted of five separate parts . 
 In June 2000 the fossil was returned to China . In the October 2000 issue , National Geographic published the results of their investigation . 
 = = Ongoing confusion = = 
 The fossils involved in the " Archaeoraptor " scandal have led to ongoing confusion over taxon names . In December 2000 , Microraptor was described in Nature . Zhou et al . ( 2002 ) examined the upper body of the " Archaeoraptor " fossil and reported that it belonged to the previously @-@ named genus Yanornis . 
 = = = Dinosaur Museum Journal = = = 
 In 2002 the Czerkases published a volume through their Dinosaur Museum titled Feathered Dinosaurs and the Origin of Flight . In this journal they described and named several species . Of the six species named in the book , five are disputed . 
 Despite the work of Zhou et al . ( 2002 ) , Czerkas and co @-@ author Xu Xing described the upper portion of the " Archaeoraptor " fossil as a new bird genus , <unk> , in the Dinosaur Museum Journal . The article does include the caveat that it might actually be a specimen of Yanornis . Thus , this same fossil specimen has been named " Archaeoraptor " , <unk> , and Yanornis , in different places . 
 Across the monographs in the Dinosaur Museum Journal , Stephen Czerkas built a case for his controversial view that maniraptoran dinosaurs are secondarily flightless birds . In so doing , he criticized prominent paleontologists . In the text on Cryptovolans , Czerkas accused Dr. Mark Norell of misinterpreting the fossil BPM 1 3 @-@ 13 as having long leg feathers due to the " blinding influences of preconceived ideas . " In fact , though , Norell 's interpretation was correct , and Czerkas added leg feathers to his own reconstruction of the fossil in the art that promotes the traveling exhibit . 
 Two other taxa that Czerkas and his co @-@ authors named were later treated as junior synonyms by other authors . Czerkas ' Cryptovolans was treated as Microraptor , and his <unk> was treated as <unk> . Czerkas described <unk> , noting that it was similar to Sapeornis . Later specimens of Sapeornis with skulls demonstrated that the two were probably synonymous . 
 Another taxon that Czerkas assigned to the <unk> and named <unk> was reviewed by Dr. Chris Bennett . Bennett found multiple misidentifications of bones and inconsistencies between Czerkas ' diagrams and the actual fossils . Bennett found the specimen to be an indeterminate diapsid and criticized the previous authors for publishing a species name when no diagnostic characters below the class level could be verified . He made <unk> a nomen dubium . 
 = = = Traveling exhibit = = = 
 In 2001 Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas compiled a traveling exhibit containing 34 other Chinese fossils . The show is titled Feathered Dinosaurs and the Origin of Flight . The San Diego Natural History Museum paid a set fee to the Dinosaur Museum to display this show in 2004 . When the show opened , Dr. Ji Qiang told reporters from Nature that about a dozen of the fossils had left China illegally . Ji arranged with the Czerkases to assign accession numbers to three of the most valuable specimens , thus formally adding them to the collection of Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences in Beijing , although they remain in the possession of the Czerkases . Stephen Czerkas denied Ji 's assertion that the fossils were illegal . Sylvia Czerkas told Nature magazine that she had worked out an agreement with officials of Liaoning Province in 2001 to borrow the fossils , and that they were to be repatriated in 2007 . Through March 2009 , however , the show is scheduled for the Fresno Metropolitan Museum of Art and Science in California . According to Nature , the Czerkases refused requests to make the officials from Liaoning available for interview . 
 Many scientists consider it unethical to work on fossils if there is any chance that they have been smuggled , and many disregard privately owned fossils altogether . Some professionals feel that private collectors put fossils in private hands where science may not be able to access or study them . Some believe that private collectors may damage important fossils , subject them to forgery , and obscure their origins or evidence about their ages . Illegal dealers have also participated in , and may encourage , governmental corruption . Another philosophy argues that if scientists could bend their ethics and agree to publish on important private fossils , this would encourage private holders to make them available for study .

 In April 2000 Olson published an article in Backbone , the newsletter of the National Museum of Natural History . In this article he justified his views on the evolution of birds , but also revised and redescribed the species " Archaeoraptor liaoningensis " by designating just the tail of the original fraudulent specimen as the type specimen . To prevent the tainted name " Archaeoraptor " from entering <unk> literature , this redescription assigned the name to that part of the chimeric specimen least likely to be classified under Aves , rather than to the portion which was later shown to represent a true bird species . Olson presumed that the National Geographic article had already validly named the fossil , and he therefore failed to explicitly indicate the name was new , as demanded by article 16 of the ICZN as a condition for a name to be valid . Several months afterwards Xu , Zhou and Wang published their description of Microraptor <unk> in Nature . 
 = = = Creationism = = = 
 The scandal is sometimes used by creationists like Kent Hovind , Kirk Cameron , and Ray Comfort to cast doubt on the hypothesis that birds evolved from dinosaurs . Many creationists insist that no missing links between birds and dinosaurs have been found , and commonly point to " Archaeoraptor " as evidence of misconduct performed to support the evolutionary theory . They see " Archaeoraptor " as a real " Piltdown Bird " . However , contrary to the Piltdown Man , " Archaeoraptor " was not a deliberate hoax . Furthermore , the authenticity of " Archaeoraptor " would not have been an essential proof for the hypothesis that birds are theropods , as this is sufficiently corroborated by other data ; paleontologist Christopher Brochu concluded in November 2001 : " That birds are derived theropod dinosaurs is no longer the subject of scholarly dispute . " Though playing the role of " terrestrial dinosaur " in the " Archaeoraptor " affair , Microraptor , showing wings and clear traces of rectrices , is generally assumed to have had at least a gliding capacity and is itself an excellent example of a transitional fossil .

 <unk> ( Thai : <unk> ์ , Chinese : <unk> / <unk> ) was a 5th @-@ century Indian Theravada Buddhist commentator and scholar . His best @-@ known work is the Visuddhimagga " Path of Purification " , a comprehensive summary and analysis of the Theravada understanding of the Buddha 's path to liberation . The interpretations provided by Buddhaghosa have generally constituted the orthodox understanding of Theravada scriptures since at least the 12th century CE . He is generally recognized by both Western scholars and <unk> as the most important commentator of the Theravada . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Limited reliable information is available about the life of Buddhaghosa . Three primary sources of information exist : short prologues and epilogues attached to Buddhaghosa 's works ; details of his life recorded in the Mahavamsa , a Sri Lankan chronicle ; and a later biographical work called the Buddhaghosuppatti . A few other sources discuss the life of Buddhaghosa , but do not appear to add any reliable material . His name means " Voice of the Buddha " ( Buddha + <unk> ) in Pali . 
 The biographical excerpts attached to works attributed to Buddhaghosa reveal relatively few details of his life , but were presumably added at the time of his actual composition . Largely identical in form , these short excerpts describe Buddhaghosa as having come to Sri Lanka from India and settled in Anuradhapura . Besides this information , they provide only short lists of teachers , supporters , and associates of Buddhaghosa , whose names are not generally to be found elsewhere for comparison . 
 The Mahavamsa records that Buddhaghosa was born into a Brahmin family in the kingdom of Magadha . He is said to have been born near Bodh Gaya , and to have been a master of the Vedas , traveling through India engaging in philosophical debates . Only upon encountering a Buddhist monk named <unk> was Buddhaghosa bested in debate , first being defeated in a dispute over the meaning of a Vedic doctrine and then being confounded by the presentation of a teaching from the <unk> . Impressed , Buddhaghosa became a bhikkhu ( Buddhism monk ) and undertook the study of the <unk> and its commentaries . On finding a text for which the commentary had been lost in India , Buddhaghosa determined to travel to Sri Lanka to study a Sinhalese commentary that was believed to have been preserved . 
 In Sri Lanka , Buddhaghosa began to study what was apparently a very large volume of <unk> texts that had been assembled and preserved by the monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya . Buddhaghosa sought permission to synthesize the assembled Sinhalese @-@ language commentaries into a comprehensive single commentary composed in Pali . The elder monks sought to first test Buddhaghosa 's knowledge by assigning him the task of elaborating the doctrine regarding two verses of the <unk> ; Buddhaghosa replied by composing the Visuddhimagga . His abilities were further tested when deities intervened and hid the text of his book , twice forcing him to recreate it from scratch . When the three texts were found to completely summarize all of the <unk> and match in every respect , the monks acceded to his request and provided Buddhaghosa with the full body of their commentaries . 
 Buddhaghosa went on to write commentaries on most of the other major books of the Pali Canon , with his works becoming the definitive <unk> interpretation of the scriptures . Having synthesized or translated the whole of the Sinhalese commentary preserved at the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya , Buddhaghosa reportedly returned to India , making a pilgrimage to Bodh Gaya to pay his respects to the Bodhi Tree . 
 The details of the Mahavamsa account cannot readily be verified ; while it is generally regarded by Western scholars as having been embellished with legendary events ( such as the hiding of Buddhaghosa 's text by the gods ) , in the absence of contradictory evidence it is assumed to be generally accurate . While the Mahavamsa claims that Buddhaghosa was born in northern India near Bodh Gaya , the epilogues to his commentaries make reference to only one location in India as being a place of at least temporary residence : <unk> in southern India . Some scholars thus conclude ( among them Oskar von <unk> and <unk> <unk> Thera ) that Buddhaghosa was actually born in South India and was relocated in later biographies to give him closer ties to the region of the Buddha . 
 The Buddhaghosuppatti , a later biographical text , is generally regarded by Western scholars as being legend rather than history . It adds to the Mahavamsa tale certain details , such as the identity of Buddhaghosa 's parents and his village , as well as several dramatic episodes , such as the conversion of Buddhaghosa 's father and Buddhaghosa 's role in deciding a legal case . It also explains the eventual loss of the Sinhalese originals that Buddhaghosa worked from in creating his Pali commentaries by claiming that Buddhaghosa collected and burnt the original manuscripts once his work was completed . 
 = = Writings and translations = = 
 Buddhaghosa was reputedly responsible for an extensive project of synthesizing and translating a large body of Sinhala commentaries on the Pāli Canon . His Visuddhimagga ( Pāli : Path of Purification ) is a comprehensive manual of Theravada Buddhism that is still read and studied today . The Mahavamsa ascribes a great many books to Buddhaghosa 's composition , some of which are not believed to have been his work , but rather were composed later and attributed to him . 
 Below is a listing of the fourteen commentaries on the Pāli Canon traditionally ascribed to Buddhaghosa , the <unk> : 
 While traditional accounts list Buddhaghosa as the author of all of these works , the current consensus among scholars accepts only the Visuddhimagga and the commentaries on the first four <unk> as Buddhaghosa 's work . 
 = = Influence and Legacy = = 
 In the 12th century , the Sri Lankan monk <unk> became the leading scholar of the Theravada following the reunification of the Sri Lankan monastic community by King Parakramabahu I. <unk> incorporated many of the works of Buddhaghosa into his own interpretations . In subsequent years , many monks from Theravada traditions in Southeast Asia sought ordination or re @-@ ordination in Sri Lanka because of the reputation of the Sri Lankan Mahavihara lineage for doctrinal purity and scholarship . The result was the spread of the teachings of the Mahavihara tradition — and thus Buddhaghosa — throughout the Theravada world . Buddhaghosa 's commentaries thereby became the standard method by which the Theravada scriptures were understood , establishing Buddhaghosa as the definitive interpreter of Theravada doctrine . 
 In later years , Buddhaghosa 's fame and influence inspired various accolades . His life story was recorded , in an expanded and likely exaggerated form , in a Pali chronicle known as the Buddhaghosuppatti , or " The Development of the Career of Buddhaghosa " . Despite the general belief that he was Indian by birth , he later may have been claimed by the Mon people of Burma as an attempt to assert primacy over Sri Lanka in the development of Theravada tradition . Other scholars believe that the Mon records refer to another figure , but whose name and personal history are much in the mold of the Indian Buddhaghosa . 
 Finally , Buddhaghosa 's works likely played a significant role in the revival and preservation of the Pali language as the scriptural language of the Theravada , and as a lingua franca in the exchange of ideas , texts , and scholars between Sri Lanka and the Theravada countries of mainland Southeast Asia . The development of new analyses of Theravada doctrine , both in Pali and Sinhalese , seems to have dried up prior to Buddhaghosa 's emergence in Sri Lanka . In India , new schools of Buddhist philosophy ( such as the Mahayana ) were emerging , many of them making use of classical Sanskrit both as a scriptural language and as a language of philosophical discourse . The monks of the Mahavihara may have attempted to counter the growth of such schools by re @-@ emphasizing the study and composition in Pali , along with the study of previously disused secondary sources that may have vanished in India , as evidenced by the Mahavamsa . Early indications of this resurgence in the use of Pali as a literary language may be visible in the composition of the Dipavamsa and the <unk> , both dating to shortly before Buddhaghosa 's arrival in Sri Lanka . The addition of Buddhaghosa 's works — which combined the pedigree of the oldest Sinhalese commentaries with the use of Pali , a language shared by all of the Theravada learning centers of the time — provided a significant boost to the revitalization of the Pali language and the Theravada intellectual tradition , possibly aiding the Theravada school in surviving the challenge to its position posed by emerging Buddhist schools of mainland India . 
 Some scholars have argued that Buddhaghosa 's writing evinces a strong but unacknowledged Yogācāra Buddhist influence , which subsequently came to characterize Theravada thought in the wake of his profound influence on the Theravada tradition . 
 = = Critics = = 
 The Visuddhimagga reflects changes in interpretation which appeared during the centuries since the Buddha 's time . 
 The Australian Buddhist monastic Shravasti <unk> is critical of contemporary practice . He concludes that Buddhaghosa did not believe that following the practice set forth in the Visuddhimagga will really lead him to Nirvana , basing himself on the postscript to the Visuddhimagga : 
 Even Buddhaghosa did not really believe that Theravada practice could lead to Nirvana . His Visuddhimagga is supposed to be a detailed , step by step guide to enlightenment . And yet in the postscript [ ... ] he says he hopes that the merit he has earned by writing the <unk> will allow him to be reborn in heaven , abide there until <unk> ( Maitreya ) appears , hear his teaching and then attain enlightenment . 
 Yet <unk> notes that this postscript does not appear in the original Pali . 
 According to <unk> , Buddhaghosa was influenced by Mahayana @-@ thought , which were subtly mixed with Theravada orthodoxy to introduce new ideas . Eventually this led to the flowering of metaphysical tendencies , in contrast to the original stress on anattā in early Buddhism 
 = Idiotest = 
 Idiotest ( a portmanteau of " idiot " and " test " and stylized as Id ! <unk> ) is an American television game show broadcast by Game Show Network ( GSN ) . Hosted by Ben Gleib , the series features contestants in teams of two competing to answer brain teaser and puzzle questions . The winning team advances to a bonus round for an opportunity to increase their winnings to $ 10 @,@ 000 . The series was announced at GSN 's upfront presentation in March 2014 ; the first episode premiered on August 12 of that year . 
 Critical reception for the series has been mixed , with one writer calling it " enjoyable " while another called it " uninteresting . " Additionally , GSN released an online game midway through the first season that allows users to answer questions from the series ' past episodes . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The main game features two pairs of contestants answering brain teaser questions . In the first round , each team faces two questions , taking the form of a visual puzzle . Contestants can work together and must answer by pointing to the correct answer ( or answers depending on what the question is asking them ) on the screen . The question is often phrased so that the contestants may be misled if they do not read it correctly ( for example , " Touch the largest greenhouse " could be misread as " Touch the largest green house " ) The value of the question begins at $ 300 , with $ 20 deducted for every second the team takes in answering ; the money begins counting down when the puzzle first appears on the screen . The money stops counting down when the contestants submit an answer on the touchscreen . For all questions , a correct answer earns the remaining money , while a wrong answer or no answer earns nothing . In round two , there are 4 questions with each contestant working alone and cannot confer with their partners . The opening value of the question is $ 500 , decreasing by $ 25 each second until an answer is given . In the third round , one contestant from each team faces the same question simultaneously . Contestants have their own money countdown , which starts at $ 1 @,@ 000 and decreases by $ 50 per second . The other contestant from each team then faces a more difficult question , with an opening value of $ 2 @,@ 500 and decreasing by $ 100 per second . The host usually reads the question to the contestants during this round . After this second question , the team that has more money wins it and plays the bonus round for $ 10 @,@ 000 . If the game ended in a tie , the team who solves their puzzles the fastest are the winners . 
 = = = Smart Money Round = = = 
 In the bonus round , entitled the " Smart Money Round " , each member of the winning team plays the same question individually . While the first contestant is asked the question , the second is isolated offstage so that they cannot see or hear the question . The two teammates have a total of 40 seconds to answer ( in seasons 1 and 2 , the time limit was 30 seconds ) ; the clock stops when the first contestant submits an answer , and resumes when the second contestant first sees the question . If one team member answers the question correctly , they receive an additional $ 1 @,@ 000 ; if both answer correctly , their winnings are augmented to $ 10 @,@ 000 . 
 Midway through the first season , another version of the " Smart Money Round " was introduced requiring a team to correctly answer five questions in 60 seconds , with five @-@ second penalties for wrong answers . Each correct answer is worth $ 500 , with five correct answers winning $ 10 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Online version = = = 
 An online game based on the series was developed for GSN 's website midway through the show 's first season . The game allows online users to answer questions seen on the actual show . Answering a certain amount of questions correctly allows players to level up and face more difficult questions ; a total of 32 levels are available . 
 = = Production = = 
 The show received very little advanced press before it was announced at GSN 's 2014 – 15 upfront presentation on March 18 , 2014 . At the presentation , GSN revealed plans to order 40 episodes of the series , while confirming August 12 as the premiere date on June 19 , 2014 . On October 28 , 2014 , the show was renewed for a 65 @-@ episode second season , which began airing April 1 , 2015 . The series was renewed for a third season on March 16 , 2016 , with the season premiere airing on April 12 . 
 The series has also produced some special editions featuring contestants from a preexisting rivalry . These episodes have included competitions between USC and UCLA graduates , as well as an Election Day special between pairs of Democrats and Republicans . This theme was revived with a special episode entitled Political Idiotest , which both taped and aired April 20 , 2016 and featured brain teasers referring to political subjects . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The series has received mixed reviews from critics . Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment argued the series to be " truly enjoyable to watch " while calling Gleib 's hosting " sarcastic and funny " . Conversely , Tim Conroy of Media Life Magazine argued that the show " just doesn 't do the trick " and thought Gleib had a difficult time " drawing amusing responses from the contestants " . Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times was equally unimpressed , saying that the show had " low ambitions " and arguing that Gleib 's hosting made the show " even more uninteresting " . Paired with the mixed critical reception , the series has seen a wide range of ratings for new episodes , bringing in between 245 @,@ 000 and 561 @,@ 000 total viewers during the first season . 
 The season two double episode premiere drew 388 @,@ 000 and 360 @,@ 000 viewers respectively . 
 = Puzzlejuice = 
 Puzzlejuice is a 2012 indie puzzle video game for iOS produced and developed by video game company Sirvo . The game is a combination of Tetris , tile @-@ matching , and Boggle : players rearrange falling tetromino blocks into rows of similar colors , which turn into letters that are cleared from the board by forming words . The fast @-@ paced game also includes challenges and power @-@ ups . The development team consisted three people ; programmer Asher Vollmer initially developed the game alone , before reaching out to artist Greg Wohlwend for advice on the aesthetics . Composer Jimmy Hinson produced the game 's music . 
 The game was released January 19 , 2012 to what video game review score aggregator Metacritic called " generally favorable " reviews . Multiple reviewers mentioned the difficulty involved in juggling the three game components simultaneously . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Puzzlejuice , the player turns falling tetrominos into letters , and those letters into words and points . The player taps and drags on the touchscreen to rotate and position multicolored tetrominos that fall from the top of the screen . When the player completes a solid row of tiles , or arranges the fallen blocks such that four or more like @-@ colored tiles touch , the color tiles turn into letters . Players connect these letter tiles with their eight adjacent tiles ( in ordinal directions ) to make words . Words of sufficient length are cleared from play as well as their adjacent tiles — thus longer words clear more blocks . The iPhone version shows a magnified version of the tile obscured by the player 's finger near the finger . The game has been compared to a cross between Boggle , Tetris , and tile @-@ matching . 
 The game also offers objectives to be accomplished over multiple sessions , like making a six @-@ letter word , or clearing three or more rows at once . This unlocks power @-@ ups that occasionally provide opportunities such as halting the rate of new tetromino drops , and removing blocks from the screen . Up to three power @-@ ups can be selected to be used in each game . 
 The object of the game is to get the highest score . There are two play modes : Zen and Core . There is a 90 @-@ second time limit in Zen mode . In Core mode , players play until the screen fills with poorly placed tetrominos , similar to Tetris . Core has two difficulties . On the easiest difficulty , three @-@ letter words suffice , but harder modes require five @-@ letter words at a minimum . A score multiplier grows as players maintain a combo of multiple words created in succession , and resets if players are too slow . Scores are uploaded to Game Center . 
 = = Development = = 
 Puzzlejuice was built by a group called Collaboratory and later renamed Sirvo . The three @-@ person team consisted of programmer Asher Vollmer , artist Greg Wohlwend , and composer Jimmy Hinson . The game began as Vollmer 's idea . He later reached out to Wohlwend for aesthetic advice , which resulted in a 365 @-@ message chain email and the final product . Wohlwend and Vollmer did not speak a word to each other — or use a medium outside of Gmail and Twitter — throughout the entire development process . The title was inspired by what Vollmer described as the " <unk> " American culture of the 1990s , exemplified by the board game Crossfire and juice @-@ filled <unk> fruit snacks . A similar game , Spelltower , was released during Puzzlejuice 's development , but Vollmer and Wohlwend ultimately considered their game sufficiently different to proceed . Puzzlejuice was selected for the PAX 10 , a spotlighted group of indie games , in July 2012 . The game was released as a universal app for iPhone and iPad on January 19 , 2012 . Vollmer expressed an interest in bringing the game to Steam Greenlight in August 2012 .

 The game received " generally favorable " reviews , according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic . Multiple reviewers compared its core mechanics to a combination of Boggle , Tetris , and a tile @-@ matching game , such as Bejeweled or Puyo Puyo . Comparing word games , Edge called it the " fast @-@ paced action @-@ adventure " to Spelltower 's " survival horror " . Multiple reviewers mentioned the difficulty in mentally balancing the various components of the game , which VideoGamer.com compared to " doing open heart surgery while playing Dance Dance Revolution " . 
 Edge suggested playing on the game 's hardest difficulty , which they found the most engaging . They called it " mayhem , ... elegantly handled " . Pocket Gamer 's Harry Slater said the game " forces your brain to think in ways that it 's never been asked to before " . Edge compared the game 's challenges to Jetpack Joyride 's missions , and complimented the connection between Vollmer 's " magpie " design and Wohlwend 's " <unk> flat pastel @-@ colored art " . Phil Eaves of Slide to Play wrote that the player should play with headphones or else miss a " wonderful " chiptune soundtrack . 
 Edge called the game " too hectic and exhausting " to return to often . VideoGamer.com 's Mark Brown struggled with registering the right input on the small screen , and found himself inadvertently making words from letters instead of moving color blocks . Slide to Play 's Eaves was also troubled by the controls , and recommended the iPad version for the extra screen space . Pocket Gamer 's Slater said it was too easy to clear the board with three @-@ letter words , and thus that the design execution was not as robust as the concept , never being " more than the sum of its strange combination of parts " . While TouchArcade 's Troy Woodfield called the gameplay " not ... totally original " in how it combines three common game ideas , he still found the combination " a stroke of genius " , and highly recommended the game as " a breath of fresh air " . Brown of VideoGamer.com agreed that Puzzlejuice distinguished itself from the crowded iOS puzzle game genre , and Slide to Play 's Eaves called its balance between game types " perfect " . 
 = Potlatch River = 
 The Potlatch River is in the state of Idaho in the United States . About 56 miles ( 90 km ) long , it is the lowermost major tributary to the Clearwater River , a tributary of the Snake River that is in turn a tributary of the Columbia River . Once surrounded by arid grasslands of the Columbia Plateau adjacent to the western foothills of the Rocky Mountains , the Potlatch today is used mainly for agriculture and irrigation purposes . 
 Its name derives from <unk> , a type of ceremony held by the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest ; one such tribe lived along the river for hundreds of years before the arrival of whites . Pioneers settled the watershed and established farms and ranches in the late 19th century . After that , logging eliminated most of the forests within the watershed and the ecology of the river is still in the process of recovery . Fishing , hiking and camping are popular recreational activities on the river ; 14 percent the watershed lies on public lands . Before logging and agriculture , many varieties of riparian and forest plants once populated the catchment , and several species of fish still swim the river and its tributaries . 
 = = Course and drainage = = 
 The Hoodoo Mountains are the source of the Potlatch River . The Potlatch 's course traces a southwesterly line across the eastern Columbia Plateau in the arid Rocky Mountain foothills . Two forks form the river 's headwaters in the southern part of the Idaho Panhandle . The West Fork drains part of Latah County and the East Fork is in Clearwater County . These two forks combine near Helmer , and soon the river descends into a canyon that continues all the way to the mouth . While in the canyon , it receives Pine , Big Bear , Middle Potlatch and Little Potlatch Creeks from the north , and Boulder and Cedar Creeks from the south . Idaho State Highway 3 follows part of the lower canyon , and the town of <unk> is located at the Middle Potlatch Creek confluence . The river merges with the Clearwater at the elevation of 801 feet ( 244 m ) between the towns of Myrtle and Spalding . Its average discharge at the mouth , according to a USGS stream gauge , is 379 @.@ 8 cubic feet per second ( 10 @.@ 75 m3 / s ) . A peak flow of 8 @,@ 150 cubic feet per second ( 231 m3 / s ) was recorded there in 2006 . The river reaches its highest peaks in the winter and early spring , while it reduces to a trickle by summer and autumn . The river mainly flows over and through coarse Columbia River basalts that comprise the Columbia Plateau , similar in geology to the Palouse River farther west . 
 = = History = = 
 Native Americans of the Nez Perce tribe have lived along the Potlatch River for hundreds of years . The Potlatch River area was once a broad sweep of dry grassland bordered by forested mountains , on the eastern edge of the arid Columbia Plateau . Because of its location just southwest of the foothills of the Rockies , the Potlatch River receives much more rainfall than watersheds just to the west , such as the Palouse and Tucannon Rivers . In 1805 and again in 1806 , the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed the mouth of the Potlatch River while traveling down the Clearwater River . They referred to it as " a large creek " and named it Colter 's Creek , in honor of John Colter , a member of the expedition . It is not known if they were the first whites to see the river . The modern name of the river was adopted in 1897 . 
 The native environment stayed relatively intact until settlers began to arrive in western Idaho in great numbers in the 1870s , and miners also were attracted by a gold strike at nearby Orofino , on the banks of the Clearwater River . Many of these emigrants set up dryland farms and ranches in the prairies surrounding the Potlatch River . Soil conditions generally improve as one travels southwards through the watershed , but there was a major drawback to growing crops in the southern part of the basin : the inaccessibility of water . Already scarce in the arid Potlatch River drainage , the river 's water was hard to reach because of the steep canyon it passes through in most of its lower course . Farmers were restricted to growing crops that did not require irrigation , and many of the lands that did not have access to abundant @-@ enough water were relegated to pasture or hay producing status . 
 At first , the forests of the watershed were not significantly affected , but after logging operations sprung up near the start of the 20th century , most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared . The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses , such as building houses and barns . Soon , however , the Washington , Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area , allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin . Logging turned out to be a very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed . 
 Splash dams , greased chutes , railroad landings , railroad branch lines and steam donkey operations were among the strategies utilized to exploit the watershed 's resources of timber . Unfortunately , railroad embankments and fills used to build up tributaries had artificially straightened them in the process , and erosion increased dramatically on the barren hillside , causing many streams to become much <unk> than they naturally would be . Nearly all the old @-@ growth forest in the watershed is now gone , and the forests that remain are mostly second @-@ growth stands . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 At one time the river 's watershed was dominated by grassland mostly consisting of Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass . <unk> , quaking aspen , maple , and alder formed the riparian zone along the Potlatch River . In the foothills , a meadow steppe environment abounding with black hawthorn , snowberry and small conifers flourished , while along the banks of smaller tributaries , hawthorn and mock orange grew . Camas and forbs thrived in the thinly distributed seasonal wetlands along the river and its larger tributary creeks . The forests were mainly a mix of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine , interspersed with rare stands of grand fir , western redcedar , western white pine , and larch , and an understory of <unk> , ninebark , serviceberry , wild rose and snowberry . Wildfires burned through the watershed from time to time , clearing the way for new growth . After human intervention , these vegetation communities continued to persist , but in lesser numbers , and the grasslands have mostly been wiped out by farming . The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 50 inches ( 380 to 1 @,@ 270 mm ) per year , and annual variations in temperature are around 25 to 100 ° F ( − 4 to 38 ° C ) . 
 According to a study from 2003 – 2004 , there were 13 different species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed , including speckled dace , longnose dace , rainbow trout ( both wild and farm @-@ raised ) , brook trout , largemouth bass , pumpkinseed , northern pikeminnow , redside shiner , sculpin , <unk> sucker , largescale sucker , and yellow perch . Migration of steelhead , the anadromous phase of rainbow trout , has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers . The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed , while steelhead accounted for 58 @.@ 4 % of the biomass . Of all the streams sampled during the study , the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition . The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff . From 2005 to 2008 , the population of steelhead ( rainbow ) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program ( <unk> ) . There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river , while an average of 226 was recorded annually in one of the river 's larger tributaries , Big Bear Creek . Over 1 @,@ 000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years . <unk> of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6 @,@ 976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9 @,@ 491 . The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch .

 Forests cover about 57 % of the Potlatch River watershed , while about 38 % is used for agriculture and ranching . 78 % of the land is privately owned while 14 % lie within national forests . 7 % is owned by the state , while the Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Indian Affairs each have a 1 % share .

 Many of the mountainous and forested sections of the drainage basin lie protected under national forest lands . There are several campgrounds overseen by the U.S. Forest Service in the headwaters of the Potlatch River watershed . Fishing is also good in the Potlatch River and many of its tributaries . Anglers are only permitted to catch brook trout , cutthroat trout , and rainbow and steelhead trout . The Department of Fish and Game annually stocks fish in the river . Fishing is permitted on the Potlatch from its mouth upstream to where Moose Creek joins the river near Bovill , as well as on the East Fork .

Central themes in the novel include independence , redemption and friendship . Stead also wanted to demonstrate the possibilities that she saw in time travel . The author hoped to show her children what New York was like in her childhood , and demonstrate how in an earlier time children were more independent . 
 When You Reach Me was inspired by a newspaper article about a man suffering from amnesia , and by parts of her childhood and her favorite book , A Wrinkle in Time . After completing much of the novel , Stead gave the draft to her editor , Wendy Lamb , who liked it . They expanded on the initial concepts and published When You Reach Me on July 14 , 2009 , under Wendy Lamb Books , an imprint of Random House . The book was well received by critics , who praised its realistic setting and the author 's deft handling of small details . The novel has reached the best @-@ seller lists of The New York Times , Los Angeles Times and USA Today . In addition to receiving the 2010 Newbery Medal , When You Reach Me won several Best Book of the Year awards . 
 = = Concept and development = = 
 The two main characters are Miranda , and the laughing man . Stead began writing When You Reach Me in 2007 after reading an article in The New York Times gave her an idea for a novel about traveling in time to save someone 's life . The article was about a man who woke up in Denver suffering from amnesia , having forgotten who he was or why he was there . Many people worked with the man to help him regain his memory . Under hypnosis , he spoke about his apparent wife , Penny , and two daughters who died in a car crash . However , when he and Penny reunited , the man found out she was only his fiancée — and they had no children . Upon reading this , Stead wondered if somehow the man had returned to the past to prevent an accident but lost his memory along the way . In addition , the article reminded Stead of a strange old man , called the ' laughing man ' , who lived near her house as a child . 
 While the news story initially inspired Stead , she also tied in parts of her childhood into the novel . Besides the laughing man , she included her primary school , her apartment and a sandwich store where she used to work . Stead also added memories of herself acting mean without reason . Slowly the novel became " more and more about these ordinary mysteries of life and less about the fantastic time @-@ travel @-@ y one " . After developing the basic idea , Stead began researching the science behind time travel to make sure her ideas would be logical . She asked her father for help with the science and complicated technical aspects , since he enjoyed mathematical puzzles . As they talked about time travel , Stead " just kept falling into the same hole with the logic , and he really helped me straighten it out " . 
 When Stead was only halfway done , she hit a wall : she wondered if she had focused the novel too much on her own personal life and problems . By her 40th birthday in January 2008 , she had stopped writing . One week after her birthday celebration , Stead went to a writers ' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write . This speech worked as an antidote to Stead 's writer 's block ; she started working on When You Reach Me again . After she had written two @-@ thirds of the novel , Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House . <unk> the script , Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book . Unlike Stead 's debut novel First Light , which Lamb heavily edited , Lamb modified nothing on the first draft of When You Reach Me . Throughout the process , Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure " revision hadn 't created any holes or contradictions in the plot " . 
 = = = A Wrinkle in Time = = = 
 Throughout the story , the main character Miranda is often reading Madeleine L 'Engle 's A Wrinkle in Time , Stead 's favorite book as a child ; she read and reread it multiple times . She recalls that L 'Engle was the only author she met in her childhood . Stead described the novel as a talisman for Miranda ; she included it in the first draft and planned to remove it , " because you can 't just toss A Wrinkle in Time in there casually " . Her editor suggested leaving it in if it could be better tied into the story . Stead was aware that she did not want A Wrinkle in Time to have too big an influence on When You Reach Me . Keeping this in mind , she reread A Wrinkle in Time through the perspective of different characters , which enabled her to develop new connections and ideas in her own work . 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 When You Reach Me takes place during the 1978 @-@ 1979 school year of Miranda , the main character . Stead placed Miranda 's home in the Upper West Side , New York City , where Stead grew up . Many parts of the novel explore " the same streets where Stead grew up , and riffs on some of her experiences " . Stead was inspired to use this setting because she moved into an apartment near her childhood home early in the development of the story . There she had experienced her first independence while exploring the streets , only to find a scary man near her house . Wondering why he was there , Stead later used this encounter as " the anchor as she wrote When You Reach Me " . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 When You Reach Me follows a sixth @-@ grade protagonist , Miranda . She lives with her single mother who has a kindhearted boyfriend , Richard . Miranda 's best friend Sal , who she knew since she was a small child , had recently started ignoring Miranda after he had been punched in the stomach by another boy , Marcus . 
 A homeless man lives on the corner of Miranda 's street . She calls him the " laughing man " for his tendency to laugh without cause . Miranda notices that he always utters the words " book bag pocket shoe " . The phrase refers to the order and place he will send Miranda notes — her library book , a bread bag , her coat pocket and Richard 's shoe . The first three notes instruct Miranda to write a letter describing the future events . The notes , whose writer claims to be coming to Miranda 's time to save a life , offer three signs of the truth of the messages . As the plot develops , the proofs come true , and Miranda is intrigued . 
 Miranda and her new friends , Annemarie and Colin find a sandwich shop on the corner , wondering if they can get paid for a job there . The owner , Jimmy , agrees , but he does not wish to pay them with money instead he intends to give a free pop and a sandwich each day of their work . Miranda , Annemarie and Colin discover a Flintstone bank in the back of sandwich shop . Colin , wanting to see more of the bank , is pulled way by Annemarie insisting that Jimmy could find them . The next day , Jimmy fires the three workers , thinking that one of them stole the Flintstone bank , when it was actually Marcus who stole it . The workers write a card , give it to Jimmy and insist that they did not steal the bank . Jimmy believes them and let them work at the sandwich shop . He then tells them that he figured out who stole the bank . He thinks that it is Julia , a classmate in their class , and a best friend to Annemarie . He thinks she did it because she is African American . This upsets Annemarie greatly and she immediately quits her job . 
 At school , Julia starts shouting at Miranda for letting Annemarie drink soda and eat sandwiches . Julia explains that because Annemarie is epileptic she has to eat a special diet . Miranda explains that she didn 't know any of that . Colin was later hanging out with Sal . Miranda was home alone until her mom got home from work . Someone did a type of tap on her door which scares her because she doesn 't know anyone that knocks like that . She looks though the peep hole and sees Colin . She opens the door and he looks at her then kisses her . She then kisses him back . Colin smiles and then runs off . 
 In a later scene , Marcus encounters Sal . Marcus wants to apologize for his misbehavior , and chases Sal when he flees . Sal runs onto a street right ahead of an oncoming truck . Before the truck can hit Sal , the laughing man kicks Sal out of the way , sacrificing his own life for Sal 's . Miranda finds the fourth note in Richard 's shoe and learns that the laughing man came from the future to save Sal 's life . The note asks Miranda to prepare a chronicle of recent events and deliver it by hand . Miranda obeys this command . 
 Miranda 's mom is expected to appear on the $ 20 @,@ 000 Pyramid . In hopes of winning the money and having a better life , Miranda and her mom 's boyfriend Richard prep her for the show . Miranda and Sal are friends again . While her mother is on @-@ stage , Miranda reminisces about a conversation with Marcus about how no one would recognize a time @-@ traveler from a different age . She suddenly realizes that the laughing man is an older incarnation of Marcus , who has come from the future to save Sal 's life . He needed to deliver the notes to the young Marcus through Miranda , who is conveniently her friend . The novel ends as Miranda reflects on the events in an epilogue . 
 = = Genres = = 
 When You Reach Me is classified in the science fiction and mystery genres , but includes features of some other genres . Monica Edinger of The New York Times found When You Reach Me to be " a hybrid of genres , it is a complex mystery , a work of historical fiction , a school story and one of friendship , with a leitmotif of time travel running through it . " Augusta Scattergood of the Christian Science Monitor wondered , " Is When You Reach Me science fiction ? Time travel ? A highly imaginative girl 's completely conceived experience ? Maybe it 's historical fiction . After all , it is set in 1979 . " According to Mary Quattlebaum of The Washington Post , the novel is of the science fiction and time travel genres . Quattlebaum found that , unlike the usual time travel stories , When You Reach Me does not involve " cheesy time travel machines and rock- ' em @-@ <unk> ' em action [ but instead ] far surpasses the usual whodunit or sci @-@ fi adventure to become an incandescent exploration of ' life , death , and the beauty of it all . ' " Both Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly found that despite the book 's science @-@ fiction devices , the setting was still " firmly rooted in reality . " 
 Some reviewers have placed parts the novel in the mystery genre . Edinger found that despite the broad genres , the novel is mainly " a thrilling puzzle " . She relates the pieces slowly ; clues are found in the story itself , on the map , in words and chapter titles . At the end of the book everything is tied together and makes sense . Ann Crewdson of School Library Journal found that each note Miranda receives foreshadows the next event . Each note is " skillfully " integrated into the novel , along with subsequent clues , until the climax is reached and all the clues come together . Stead 's editor Lamb agreed with the mystery genre , in that " there 's plenty to wonder about after you finish the book . Just as we wonder why our feelings change so suddenly , or why someone like the laughing man appears on the corner one day . " Gurdon of The Wall Street Journal concurred with Lamb , adding that although the novel is clearly a mystery , the mystery itself is not revealed until the end where the last note comes and where everything ties together . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Aaron Mead found that , " the novel addresses the question of how to hold on to old friendships without stifling them , and it insightfully brings out the stabilizing effect that new friendships can have in the effort to preserve or reclaim old ones " . He noted that the novel deeply helps children in middle school . Crewdson opined that the book deals with the " intricacies of friendship " . 
 This theme of friendship is explored when Sal abandons his friendship with Miranda after he is hit by Marcus . Elli <unk> of The Courier @-@ Mail found that Miranda is forced to deal with the fact that Sal seemingly abandons their friendship and ignores her for no apparent reason . Scattergood considered the novel an " ordinary friendship story " with Sal ignoring Miranda to find other friends . Julie Long from Reading Time noted how the incident forces Miranda to find new friends and become more active in school , where she starts learning the dynamics of that environment . 
 Mead noted that " the book builds toward second chances for Miranda 's mother — both <unk> and relationally . " As the novel progresses , Miranda gives second chances to Julia , a girl whom Miranda initially hates , and Alice , a girl who always needs to use the bathroom but never does . Miranda previously considered Julia " a competitor for Annemarie 's affection , and Alice as the weird kid who waited too long to go to the bathroom " . By the end of the book , she finds Julia to be Annemarie 's friend and discovers that Alice is an insecure girl . 
 Stead finds that kids today are much less independent since her childhood . She wrote , " [ F ] rom age nine , my friends and I were on the streets , walking home , going to each other 's houses , going to the store . I really wanted to write about that : the independence that 's a little bit scary but also a really positive thing in a lot of ways . And I 'm not sure that most kids have that today " . Throughout the novel , Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults . They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man . While writing the novel , Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived , " send [ ing ] them on a little time @-@ travel journey of their own " . Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today 's youth is mainly due to the fact that kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them . Miller noted how , despite the lower crime rate in current times , the " characters , middle @-@ class middle school students , routinely walk around the Upper West Side by themselves , a rare freedom in today 's city . " 
 = = = Time travel = = = 
 Julianna Helt from the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette found that time travel forms a central theme as Miranda constantly wonders how time travel could be possible . In When You Reach Me , Marcus helps Miranda realize that the three old ladies from A Wrinkle in Time lied to Meg by promising they would return five minutes before they left . Marcus explains : 
 " So the garden is where they appear when they get home at the end of the book . Remember ? They land in the broccoli . So if they had gotten home five minutes before they left , like those ladies promised they would , then they would have seen themselves get back . Before they did " . 
 Roger Sutton from Horn Magazine felt that the moment Marcus explains this flaw to Miranda is the first exchange that shows the novel to be complicated and mysterious . Quattlebaum noted , " The story 's structure – an expert interweaving of past , present and future – brilliantly contradicts Miranda 's <unk> belief that the end can 't happen before the middle . " Stead explained her view of time travel in her novel , where going back in time is fulfilling the future , rather than changing it . She hoped to make the time travel element logical to show that " Miranda wasn 't struggling to understand the seeming randomness and infinity of the universe , but learning that her world has value and that people do care about her " .

 The audiobook adaption of When You Reach Me was released by Listening Library and contains four disks . In praise of Cynthia Holloway 's performance of Miranda , <unk> from Horn Book Magazine stated that her tone " emphasized the novel 's interpersonal aspects " . The reviewer found it beneficial that the chapter titles were added to the audio , since they seemed to add more detail about the book , but can be easily skipped over when reading . <unk> criticized the voicing of Miranda 's mom . AudioFile praised Halloway for " a strong reading ... [ that ] makes listeners curious about this story 's nonlinear structure " and for managing the different elements of the story . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 When You Reach Me was published on July 14 , 2009 , in hardcover format by Wendy Lamb Books , an imprint of Random House Children 's Books . Reception of When You Reach Me was positive . Reviewers praised the details and characters . The novel has reached many bestseller lists ; it was on the New York Times Best Seller list for 16 weeks ending May 9 , 2010 . It was number 127 on USA Today 's bestseller list during the week of January 28 , 2010 . On April 22 , 2010 , after staying at number 15 for two weeks , When You Reach Me left the Los Angeles Times bestseller list . 
 Reviewers lauded the realistic setting and characters . Ilene Cooper of Booklist acknowledged that although she was unsure if the ending was logical , " everything else is quite wonderful " . She praised the realistic portrayal of New York and mentioned that " the characters , children and adults ... are honest bits of humanity " . Julianna M. Helt of The Post Gazette felt that along with the " wonderful sense of middle school dynamics " , Stead 's depiction of New York City in the 1970s was superb . Quattlebaum considered no character to be minor ; each plays an important part in the story . Caitlin Augusta of School Library Journal found the setting to be " consistently strong . The stores — and even the streets — in Miranda 's neighborhood act as physical entities and impact the plot in tangible ways " . 
 Reviewers praised how Stead made every small detail matter . Augusta Scattergood of the Christian Science Monitor enjoyed the detailed work : " The beauty of Stead 's writing is found in the way she weaves subplots and settings together seamlessly . Richard 's stolen shoe drops into place . A reference to forbidden grapes is tied up sweetly . Stolen $ 2 bills ? Another part of the enigma explained by the end . " <unk> agreed , commenting that despite the small size of the novel compared to other popular books , When You Reach Me is a " taut novel , every word , every sentence , has meaning and substance . " Publishers Weekly added that even the smallest of details — Miranda 's name , her strange habits and why she carries A Wrinkle in Time with her — have a reason for their inclusion by the end of the novel .

 = Flekkefjord Station = 
 Flekkefjord Station ( Norwegian : Flekkefjord stasjon ) is a former railway station located in Flekkefjord , Norway . It served as the terminus of the 1 @,@ 067 mm ( 3 ft 6 in ) gauge Flekkefjord Line from 1904 to 1990 . The station building was designed by Paul Armin Due and was built in brick Art Nouveau . 
 The station was important for transport along the coast until 1944 , when the completion of the Sørland Line made Flekkefjord a branch station . At the same time , the line was converted to standard gauge , the number of station tracks was reduced , and the station received an overhaul . The station building was demolished in 1970 , but the station was still served until the line closed in 1990 . The tracks and depot buildings still exist . 
 = = History = = 
 The Flekkefjord Line ran from Egersund to Flekkefjord , as an extension of the Jæren Line , that ran from Stavanger to Egersund . The Norwegian Parliament voted in favor of the line in 1894 , and construction started two years later . While initial plans were to open the line in 1902 , the station and line did not open until 1 November 1904 . The line was built as a 3 ft 6 in ( 1 @,@ 067 mm ) gauge line , and the first rolling stock was reallocated from the Voss Line . 
 Initially , there were four trains daily in each direction , reduced to three on holidays . The most important train was the one that coordinated with the west @-@ bound steam ship ; the train would wait up to 45 minutes if the ship was delayed . This become the dominant route for people to get from Stavanger to cities along the South Coast , as well as to Oslo . In addition to passengers , major cargo shipments included seasonal shipments of herring , as well as lumber from the surrounding areas . Coal for the trains was imported by steam ship to Flekkefjord . 
 With the arrival of the Kragerø Line to Kragerø in 1927 , and the Sørland Line to Arendal in 1935 , buses were used between Flekkefjord and the terminus cities , allowing land connection between Stavanger and Oslo via Flekkefjord . At the same time , diesel multiple units were introduced on the " lightning trains " , cutting travel time to Stavanger by 50 minutes to 3 hours 15 minutes . 
 The Flekkefjord Line was planned as part of the Sørland Line , that would make Flekkefjord a station on the line between Oslo , Kristiansand and Stavanger . Instead , the route of the Sørland Line was chosen to traverse an inner route , and the Flekkefjord Line became a 17 @.@ 1 km ( 10 @.@ 6 mi ) branch line of the Sørland Line in 1944 . As part of the construction , the Flekkefjord Line was converted in 1940 – 41 to standard gauge . The first standard gauge train , a NSB Class 18 , operated on 8 August 1941 . The large traffic during the reconstruction period caused so much damage to the wharf that it had to be taken out of service . The speed on the line was also reduced to 40 kilometres per hour ( 25 mph ) , as the gauge conversion was done without changing the right @-@ of @-@ way profile . Dual gauge was kept until 1 March 1944 . At the same time the four tracks at the station were reduced to three . The cargo building was also moved three metres . In June 1945 , twelve people were employed at the station . 
 With the introduction of standard gauge , Flekkefjord went from being an important hub for transport along the south coast , to merely being a branch station . However , the number of daily trains to Sira and Moi had increased to twelve , operated with Class 86 and Class 87 multiple units . The Class 87 was used until 1956 , when Class 86 came into service . In 1966 , Class 87 was reintroduced . Important cargo customers at the time were Draco ( who made boats ) and <unk> <unk> ( who made boilers ) . From 1981 , the Class 89 came into use , remaining until the station was closed in 1990 . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 As the only proper station on the line , Flekkefjord was built in brick in Art Nouveau . The two @-@ story 338 m2 ( 3 @,@ 640 sq ft ) building which was designed by Paul Armin Due had a ground floor with a ticket office , four offices and three waiting rooms . The second story was an apartment for the station master . Due chose to design the building symmetrically around the waiting room . It had arched widows and doors , curved corners and two round towers . This gave both a tight and soft form in organic interaction . It has been considered one of Due 's best works of Art Nouveau . Beside the station there was a 196 m2 ( 2 @,@ 110 sq ft ) single story restaurant building . In addition to a large main building , the station had a freight building , a wharf , a locomotive and wagon depot , and a loading area . There were four tracks past the station , in addition to two track to the cargo area . The cargo building had room for three wagons . The locomotive depot had places for six steam locomotives . 
 The restaurant was converted into housing in the 1950s , and in May 1970 the station building was demolished to make room for a new bus station . The cargo building was refurbished to serve as a station building for passengers and as offices . The wharf was sold by the municipality in 1987 , and the last train to serve the station departed on 31 December 1990 . Most of the line and infrastructure is however intact . 
 = Case of the Dean of St Asaph = 
 The Case of the Dean of St Asaph , formally R v Shipley , was the 1784 trial of William Davies Shipley , the Dean of St Asaph , for seditious libel . In the aftermath of the American War of Independence , electoral reform had become a substantial issue , and William Pitt the Younger attempted to bring a Bill before Parliament to reform the electoral system . In its support Shipley republished a pamphlet written by his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Sir William Jones , which noted the defects of the existing system and argued in support of Pitt 's reforms . Thomas <unk> , the brother of British Prime Minister Earl of Shelburne , reacted by indicting Shipley for seditious libel , a criminal offence which acted as " the government 's chief weapon against criticism " , since merely publishing something that an individual judge interpreted as libel was enough for a conviction ; a jury was prohibited from deciding whether the material was actually libellous . The law was widely seen as unfair , and a Society for Constitutional Information was formed to pay Shipley 's legal fees . With financial backing from the society Shipley was able to secure the services of Thomas Erskine KC as his barrister . 
 Shipley was tried in 1784 by Mr Justice Buller and a specially convened jury at Shrewsbury . Edward Bearcroft , counsel for the prosecution , argued that on the basis of the existing system the jury could not decide on the nature of the pamphlet , while Erskine argued not only that they could , but that the material did not constitute seditious libel , containing as it did " a solemn protest against all sedition " . Persuaded by Erskine 's arguments , the jury ruled that Shipley was neither " guilty " or " not guilty " , but instead " guilty of publication only " , a confusing and non @-@ standard ruling which , after a long dialogue , Mr Justice Buller declared to mean " guilty on all charges " . Erskine appealed the decision to the Court of King 's Bench on 8 November , where the judges again ruled that juries could not decide whether material was libellous , but nevertheless released Shipley on a technicality ; his freedom was greeted with fireworks and bonfires , and Erskine was rewarded with the Freedom of the City of Gloucester . Still seeking to reform the law , Erskine sent the court records to Charles James Fox and Lord Camden , who , after much effort , passed the Libel Act 1792 , which secured the right of juries to decide whether material was libellous . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the end of the American War of Independence , British public attention had turned to the need for Parliamentary reform – specifically , the lack of franchise in many towns and the presence of rotten boroughs . In response , William Pitt the Younger brought the idea of reform before Parliament and , in support of his actions , Sir William Jones wrote and published a pamphlet titled A Dialogue between a Farmer and a Country Gentleman on the Principles of Government , which covered the " virtues of government and defects in the representation of the people " . In 1783 Shipley , Jones 's father @-@ in @-@ law , recommended it to a group of Welsh constitutional reformers and had it reprinted in Welsh with his own preface suggesting it was " just , rational and constitutional " . As a result , Thomas <unk> , the brother of the Earl of Shelburne , indicted Shipley for seditious libel , specifically for " publishing a false , scandalous and malicious libel ... to raise seditions and tumults within the kingdom , and to excite His Majesty 's subjects to attempt , by armed rebellion and violence , to subvert the state and constitution of the nation " . 
 The law dealing with seditious libel was particularly strict . Acting as " the government 's chief weapon against criticism " , it followed principles laid down in De <unk> <unk> and R v Carr : that seditious libel was a criminal offence , that the intention of the publisher or the truth of the allegations was irrelevant , that mere publication was sufficient for a conviction , and that juries were only allowed to deliver a verdict on whether the material had been published by the defendant , not whether it was libellous . Traditionally , matters of fact were left to the jury and matters of law to the judge , but with seditious libel " matters of law " was construed very widely ; it was the judge 's job to decide if the material was libellous , what constituted " seditious libel " , and the nature of " publication " , which was understood to include almost anything . Even a private letter , if intercepted , could lead to a prosecution . 
 Because of public disquiet with these principles , Shipley 's trial acted as a " test case " for the law of seditious libel ; a Society for Constitutional Information was formed by concerned citizens and began raising money to pay for his defence . Able to afford the best representation , the society gave the brief to Thomas Erskine KC , a noted defence barrister . The trial was to be heard by Lord Kenyon , then Chief Justice of Chester , at <unk> ; after travelling 200 miles to the court Erskine discovered that a paper had been circulated in the area arguing that in libel cases juries were allowed to decide whether a publication was libellous , as well as whether it had been published . Citing the paper 's circulation , the prosecution asked for a postponement ; ignoring claims that a delay would cause Shipley hardship , Kenyon agree to postpone the trial . The case was eventually heard on 6 August 1784 by Mr Justice Buller , at Shrewsbury . 
 = = Trial and appeal = = 
 Edward Bearcroft , lead counsel for the prosecution , described the Dialogue as libel and argued that the truth of this was not a question for the jury to decide on ; they were bound to convict the defendant as long as they decided that he had published the Dialogue , regardless of the contents . Those contents , Bearcroft went on , sought to persuade the public that " every man of age had a right to choose his own representative in Parliament " . Erskine , in his reply , argued that the Dialogue was not libellous ( it opened with a preface containing " a solemn protest against all sedition " ) , and insisted that the jury had the right to decide what constituted libel : 
 If they know that the subject of the paper is the topic that <unk> the country around them ; if they see danger in that agitation , and have reason to think that the publisher must have intended it , they say he is guilty . If , on the other hand , they consider the paper to be legal and enlightening in principle ; likely to promote a spirit of activity and liberty , in times when the activity of such a spirit is essential to the public safety , and have reason to believe it to be written and published in that spirit ; they say , as they ought to do , that the writer or the publisher is not guilty . 
 To demonstrate his feelings on the subject , Erskine asked the jury to consider him a fellow defendant , since he intended to publish the pamphlet himself as soon as possible ; he then went through the Dialogue line by line , showing that not only would most people agree with it , but that it was the foundation of Pitt 's Reform Bill . After Erskine concluded his arguments , again stating that the jury should feel free to debate whether the material constituted libel , Mr Justice Buller began his summing up , instructing the jury that they were only allowed to decide on whether Shipley had published the work . The jury retired , and after half an hour of discussion returned to declare Shipley " guilty of publishing only " . After a long and " confounding " debate between Erskine , Buller , and the jury , Buller declared Shipley guilty on all counts . 
 Erskine immediately appealed the decision to the Court of King 's Bench , where he argued on 8 November that Buller 's statement had misdirected the jury , and that as the jury was traditionally not given the right to investigate Shipley 's actual guilt , the previous trial was invalid ; a jury should be permitted to determine not only whether a statement was published , but whether it was libellous . With the exception of Mr Justice Wiles , the court unanimously declared that Erskine 's arguments were incorrect , and that the jury had no such role ; accordingly , his appeal was denied . Shipley was , however , later freed when the King 's Bench held that the initial indictment had been invalid because " there were no <unk> to point the application of the paper as a libel on the king and government " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Although the case did not directly lead to legal change , it was nevertheless widely seen as a victory ; upon his release Shipley was greeted with fireworks and bonfires , and Erskine was rewarded with the Freedom of the City of Gloucester . Erskine , however , perceived it differently , and had records of the entire trial printed and sent to Charles James Fox and Lord Camden . Taking this as a hint , Fox ( after much delay ) introduced a Bill to Parliament in May 1791 , seeking to reform the law relating to libel . After it was passed through the Commons it went to the House of Lords , where members of the judiciary attempted to delay it ; in response Lord Camden , then 78 , rose and bluntly stated that if the judges were to be the sole arbiters of public opinion , nothing would be able to appear that criticised the government , leading to a stifling of the freedom of the press . His appeal was successful – without it , historian H. M. <unk> writes , the Bill would never have passed the Lords – and within three weeks Parliament had formally passed the Libel Act 1792 , commonly known as Fox 's Libel Act , allowing juries for the first time to decide precisely what constituted libel .

He returned to Australia in 1942 to become the Australian Army 's Signal Officer in Chief . He also became the first Australian Corps of Signals officer to reach the rank of major general .

 Colin Hall Simpson was born in St Kilda , Victoria , on 13 April 1894 , the son of Colin Simpson , a plumber , and his wife Elizabeth Fulton Simpson , née Jordan . He was educated at St Kilda Primary School , and , from 1911 , at Caulfield Grammar School . While at Caulfield Grammar , Simpson joined the Australian Army Cadets , rising to the rank of sergeant . After leaving school he became an apprentice pharmacist . He served with the 49th ( Prahran ) Battalion in which he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 1 March 1914 . He became its assistant adjutant on 12 April 1915 and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1915 . 
 = = First World War = = 
 Simpson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the First Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) on 1 May 1916 , and posted to the 3rd Pioneer Battalion , part of the 3rd Division , which was then being raised in Australia . He embarked from Port Melbourne on the transport HMAT Wandilla on 6 June 1916 , arriving in England on 26 July 1916 . The 3rd Division trained on the Salisbury Plain in England , where he was promoted to lieutenant on 13 October 1916 . He was transferred to the 3rd Division Signal Company on 16 November 1916 . Soon after , the 3rd Division moved to the Western Front , moving into the line near Armentières . Simpson was mentioned in despatches on 4 January 1917 . 
 The 3rd Division carried out its first offensive at the Battle of Messines in June 1917 . For his part in the battle , Simpson was awarded the Military Cross . His citation read : 
 For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty . He organised the Brigade Signal Service so thoroughly that communication was maintained with every unit throughout . He was continually under shell @-@ fire , but personally supervised all repairs , by his vigorous and cheerful manner impressing all ranks in the highest degree . 
 Simpson participated in the Battle of <unk> where he was gassed and wounded . He was evacuated to England on 22 October 1917 . While in hospital he applied for nine months ' leave to return to Australia and complete his pharmaceutical studies . He had passed the Intermediate Examination before leaving Australia but not the Final Examination . This was granted , and he embarked for home on the transport HMAT Persic on 21 December 1917 . He passed the Final Examination , and was registered as a pharmacist on 10 July 1918 . He never returned to the front , and his AIF appointment was terminated on 9 August 1918 . 
 = = Between the wars = = 
 Simpson remained in the Army as a reservist . He was posted to the 2 / 14th Infantry on 1 October 1918 , and was promoted to captain on 16 April 1920 . In the post @-@ war reorganisation of the Army , the 2 / 14th was absorbed into the 14th Infantry Battalion in March 1921 . In May , he transferred to the Royal Australian Engineers and joined the 3rd Division Signals Company . He was promoted to major on 1 July 1922 , and became its commander , with the rank of lieutenant colonel , on 1 September 1922 . On 1 January 1925 , the signal units were separated from the Engineers to form the Australian Corps of Signals , and he was transferred to the new corps . He commanded the 39th Infantry Battalion from 1 July 1929 to 30 June 1933 , after which he was on the unattached list for two years before resuming command of the 3rd Division Signals Company . On 1 May 1939 , he assumed command of the 6th Infantry Brigade , with the temporary rank of colonel . 
 Simpson opened his own chemist shop in Brunswick West in 1918 . On 12 August 1919 he married Jean Elizabeth Watson at the Congregational Church in Ascot Vale , Victoria . Their marriage produced two children , a son who died in infancy and a daughter , Jean Marjorie . One of the witnesses at their wedding ceremony was a fellow Militia officer , Alan Ramsay , who later married Jean 's sister Edna . In 1937 , Simpson banded together with D. E. Robertson and A. E. Moore to create the Allied Master Chemists of Australia Ltd , today better known as Amcal . They invited other pharmacists to join them to compete against the growing market power of major retailers . The business grew from 12 members in 1937 to over 100 by 1946 . Today Amcal is the largest retail pharmacy chain in Australia .

 Simpson joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 15 October 1939 with the rank of lieutenant colonel . He was allocated the AIF service number <unk> , and assumed command of the Australian Corps Signals . When the I Corps was formed in April 1940 , Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey was appointed its commander , and Simpson its Chief Signals Officer , with a promotion to the rank of colonel . 
 Simpson embarked on the transport Nieuw Holland on 15 September 1940 , arriving in Kantara , Egypt , on 12 October . He met with his British counterparts , and discussed arrangements for the creation of an AIF Signals School in the Middle East . Some negotiation was required before this proposal was finally accepted . He was disappointed at the standard of training that had been achieved by the I Corps and 6th Division signals units in the Middle East , and just as disappointed with the reinforcements arriving from Australia . Both the standard of training of the units and the establishment of the schools intended to remedy the situation were hampered by a serious shortage of equipment . The 6th Division 's list of critical shortfalls — by no means restricted to signals equipment — included 120 telephones and 120 miles ( 190 km ) of electrical cable . Not until January 1941 — after the 6th Division had been committed to battle in Libya — did the cable become available in Australia . Some units equipped themselves with captured enemy materiel . 
 Simpson arrived in Greece on 7 March 1941 as part of the I Corps advance party . The Battle of Greece presented a major challenge for Simpson 's signals units , as rugged terrain , enemy action and frequent troop movements conspired to frustrate their efforts to maintain reliable communications . The news that Yugoslavia had offered to surrender reached Blamey from a BBC broadcast on 15 April picked up on a receiver built into a kerosene case that Simpson had insisted that he take . Much signals equipment was lost during the fighting , and some had to be destroyed following the order to evacuate Greece . Simpson embarked for Crete on HMS Phoebe on 25 April . From there he took a flying boat to Alexandria . His first priority on arrival was arranging for the lost equipment to be replaced . 
 The shortage of signals equipment was an important factor in the delay in committing the I Corps to the Syria – Lebanon campaign until it became clear that General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson could not adequately control operations from his headquarters at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem . Once again , the signallers had to battle with inhospitable terrain . The hills and atmospheric conditions made reception difficult for the radio operations , and those same hills , along with shortages of cable , made the linesmen 's task no less difficult . He was mentioned in dispatches , and made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for " maintenance of communications under difficult conditions in the Grecian campaign " . 
 Simpson was promoted to the rank of brigadier on 11 September 1941 , becoming the first officer of the Australian Corps of Signals to reach that rank . He was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident on 13 September 1941 and suffered severe lacerations , a concussion , and a broken collarbone , rib and finger . He was taken to the 2 / 1st General Hospital , and was evacuated to Australia on the hospital ship MS Wanganella . He returned to the Middle East by air , arriving back on 20 January 1942 . 
 = = = South West Pacific = = = 
 Within days , Simpson was heading east again , taking a flying boat to Batavia , where he joined the advance party of the I Corps , which was being sent from the Middle East to the Dutch East Indies to counter the Japanese threat . He met there with the local authorities regarding signals arrangements for the defence of Java . These were soon well in hand , but the tactical situation rapidly deteriorated to the extent that the I Corps was ordered to leave Java on 21 February 1942 . Simpson departed on the troop ship Orcades , which arrived in Adelaide on 14 March . 
 Blamey was appointed Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces on 27 March . He instituted a sweeping reorganisation of the Army , replacing officers with men who had experience in the Middle East . Simpson became the Signal Officer in Chief on 6 April , with the rank of major general , the first Australian Corps of Signals officer to reach that rank . 
 One of Simpson 's first tasks was to confer with the Chief Signals Officer at General Douglas MacArthur 's General Headquarters ( GHQ ) South West Pacific Area , Brigadier General Spencer B. Akin . The two established mechanisms to divide responsibility for the theatre 's communications between the two armies , which often worked together on the same projects . An important outcome of their first meeting was the creation of the Central Bureau as a combined signals intelligence organisation . Simpson had been thinking about such an organisation while on the Orcades . Blamey had an appreciation of signals intelligence from his time as Deputy Commander in Chief in the Middle East , and readily gave his support . After a slow start , signals intelligence became an important element of the war in the South West Pacific . 
 Perhaps Simpson 's most ambitious project was the laying of a submarine cable between Cape York and New Guinea . A cable laying ship , the SS <unk> , was chartered , and two old cables that ran across the Bass Strait were lifted and re @-@ laid across the Torres Strait in October 1943 . When the land connections were completed in December 1943 , it became possible to send a message all the way from Melbourne to Port Moresby . Simpson , who was on an inspection tour of New Guinea , was on hand for the receipt of the first message . In November 1944 , he visited the front in the Netherlands , Belgium and France , returning to Australia via the United States and Canada . 
 To man his signals units , Simpson sought to obtain some 4 @,@ 000 Australian Women 's Army Service ( AWAS ) personnel . Two special signal training battalions were activated to cater for them , and Simpson inspected the 2nd Signal Training Battalion ( AWAS ) at Ivanhoe Grammar School with Lieutenant Colonel Sybil Irving on 6 July 1942 . By 1945 , the Australian Corps of Signals numbered some 25 @,@ 000 men and women . The large numbers of women serving in Signals units caused friction between Irving and Simpson over what degree of control he exercised over them . 
 Aware that signals is usually forgotten when the signallers are doing their best work , Simpson attempted to obtain various accolades for his corps . He held ceremonial parades through Melbourne to celebrate VE Day on 10 May 1945 , and VP Day on 20 August 1945 . He attempted to get the title " Royal " granted in recognition of its wartime service . This occurred on 10 November 1948 .

 Simpson handed over the position of Signal Officer in Chief to Brigadier A. D. Malloy on 23 May 1946 . He was placed on the retired list with the honorary rank of major general on 19 December 1946 . He served as Colonel Commandant for the Australian Corps of Signals in Southern Command from June 1958 to June 1963 , and was Colonel Commandant of the corps from September 1959 to December 1960 . In 1946 he was appointed director of the Columbia Graphophone Company ( Australia ) . 
 Simpson was a keen supporter of the Essendon Football Club , serving as its vice president from 1947 to 1964 . He was awarded a life membership in 1957 . He was elected Victorian State President of the Australian Legion of Ex @-@ Servicemen and Women in 1948 . He resigned in October after a dispute with the State Council over its suspension of two members for being communists , which Simpson opposed . Yet Simpson was no communist sympathiser ; far from it . He organised The Association , a clandestine right wing paramilitary organisation headed by Blamey which was established to counter a possible communist coup . The Association disbanded in 1950 .

 Simpson died of cancer in Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital on 23 August 1964 . He was survived by his wife and daughter . He was buried in St Kilda Cemetery after a funeral service at St Cuthbert 's Church in Brighton , Victoria . His pall bearers included Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring and Major General Alan Ramsay . 
 Simpson Barracks at Watsonia in Melbourne was named in his honour in 1986 . It is considered the home of the Royal Australian Corps of Signals , and contains the Defence Force School of Signals and the Royal Australian Corps of Signals Museum . 
 = Prince of Wales ( 1786 ship ) = 
 Prince of Wales was a transport ship in the First Fleet , assigned to carry convicts for the European colonisation of Australia . There is some ambiguity about her origins and she was probably launched in 1779 at Sidmouth and rebuilt at London in 1786 . Still , in 1787 she set sail for Australia , and reached Botany Bay in January 1788 . On a difficult return voyage in 1788 – 89 she became separated from her convoy , was taken eastward around the world instead of west and drifted helplessly off Rio de Janeiro for a day while her crew was incapacitated with scurvy . 
 After her return to Britain her owners deployed her as a whaler in the South Seas Fisheries . They then sold her and she became a privateer and letter of marque , before performing a voyage as a slave ship . During this voyage a French privateer captured Prince of Wales ; in a process that is currently unclear , she returned to British , albeit new , hands . Her new owners then employed her trading between London and the West Indies , the Mediterranean , and the West Indies again . She was last listed in 1810 . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Prince of Wales was a square @-@ <unk> barque of 300 to 350 tons ( bm ) , 103 feet ( 31 m ) long and 31 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 m ) wide and with a height between decks of 5 feet 8 inches ( 1 @.@ 73 m ) amidships and 5 feet 9 inches ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) fore and aft . 
 By one account , she was built in 1779 at Sidmouth as a West Indiaman with ship 's master James Johnston . By another account , she was built on the River Thames in 1786 , by the firm Christopher Watson and Co. of Rotherhithe , which had also built HMS Sirius . Both accounts give her owner as Cornhill merchant John Mather , who had previously purchased and disposed of Captain Cook 's Endeavour after that vessel had returned from Botany Bay . 
 It is possible to reconcile these accounts somewhat . There is no mention of Prince of Wales in Lloyd 's Register until 1787 , when she appears in the supplemental pages as being of 300 tons ( bm ) , launched in 1779 at Sidmouth , with master J. Mason , and owner John Mather . The reconciliation between the two origins may rest in the notation that she had been almost totally rebuilt in 1786 . It is therefore quite reasonable to suppose that she was launched at Sidmouth in 1779 and rebuilt at Rotherhithe in 1786 . 
 The entry in Lloyd 's Register , however , adds further confusion of a different sort . It reports that in 1786 Prince of Wales had been named Hannibal . The situation is more complex than that . If one works back from 1787 , the only thing that is clear is that vessels have been bought , disposed of , and renamed . 
 What appears to have occurred is a mixing of records and a confusion of names . One may conjecture that one vessel was the South Carolina @-@ built slaver Heart of Oak , launched in 1762 , repaired in 1784 , of 310 tons ( bm ) , and renamed Hannibal in 1786 . The other was the West Indiaman Hannibal , Sidmouth @-@ built , launched in 1779 , not yet rebuilt , and of 300 tons ( bm ) , and eventually renamed Prince of Wales . Unfortunately , Lloyd 's Register for 1785 is not readily available on @-@ line . Furthermore , in 1784 , although J. Mather apparently owned 17 vessels , including Heart of Oak , none was built in Sidmouth in 1779 . Nor is there any other vessel listed built in Sidmouth in 1779 . Full resolution of the issue may have to await primary research . 
 = = Voyage to Australia = = 
 The south London shipbroker William Richards contracted Prince of Wales in 1787 for the First Fleet voyage . Richards selected her after consultation with Royal Marine officers Watkin Tench and David Collins . Both officers would sail with the Fleet to Australia , Tench as a captain of marines , and Collins as judge @-@ advocate for the new colony . She was the second @-@ smallest of the First Fleet transports after Friendship , and the last to be contracted to join the voyage . 
 The Navy Board assigned Prince of Wales to the First Fleet on 2 March 1787 under the immediate command of ship 's master John Mason , and the overall command of naval officer and future Governor of New South Wales , Arthur Phillip aboard Sirius . She was the last transport added to the Fleet before it sailed . 
 She left Portsmouth on 13 May 1787 with a crew of around 25 , and was accompanied by the other vessels of the Fleet : five transports , three storeships and two Royal Navy vessels . The 24 @-@ gun post ship HMS Hyaena accompanied the Fleet through the Channel as fleet escort , departing when the ships reached Atlantic waters . Prince of Wales arrived in Tenerife on 5 June , where she was resupplied . A second resupply took place in August in the Portuguese port of Rio de Janeiro , including the delivery aboard Prince of Wales of quantities of fresh fruit and vegetables , seeds , and some rum for the marines . Prince of Wales then turned southeast with the Fleet , reaching Cape Town in October and entering the Great Southern Ocean on 13 November for the last leg of the voyage to Australia . The first death among the crew occurred on the night of 24 November when a seaman fell overboard from the topsail yard and could not be rescued . A week later a second seaman , <unk> <unk> , drowned after being washed overboard in heavy seas . 
 By mid @-@ December the ship 's supply of flour and butter for the voyage had been exhausted and Philip authorised Mason to broach the stores set aside for the future colony in order to continue to feed the convicts . A month later , on 20 January 1788 , Prince of Wales reached Australia 's Botany Bay . Six days later she sailed for Sydney Cove as part of the relocation of the convict settlement to Port Jackson . Leaving Botany Bay she collided with Friendship , losing her mainmast staysail and topsail , but the damage was swiftly repaired and she was able to enter Port Jackson in line with her fellow transports . There she landed 49 convicts , 31 marines and 23 civilians . 
 = = = Convicts = = = 
 Prince of Wales carried 47 female convicts on departure from Portsmouth . After five days at sea , 2 males were also brought across from Scarborough , ringleaders of a failed mutiny . They remained aboard Prince of Wales for the remainder of the voyage to Australia . 
 Convict health was comparatively good during the voyage , with a report by Governor Philip showing only nine cases of illness aboard Prince of Wales by the time she reached Tenerife , the least for any First Fleet transport . Indeed , Phillip wrote to Admiralty advising that " the convicts are not so sickly as when we sailed , " though the women aboard Prince of Wales had no new clothing and were still in the ragged apparel they had worn in prison . There was no ship 's surgeon aboard but Chief Surgeon John White , periodically came on board from Sirius when weather and sailing conditions permitted . As the Fleet headed toward Rio in July , humid conditions and heavy rains generated a " plague of bugs " below decks with more than a hundred insects found in one small sleeping area alone . There were also reports of rats , fleas and lice , and an outbreak of scurvy in late December . 
 Despite this , serious illness remained rare and the first convict death was from accidental causes rather than disease . On 24 July the ship 's longboat fell from a boom and struck 22 @-@ year @-@ old Jane Bonner in the head ; she died from her injuries six days later . A second convict , John Hartley , died of unknown causes on 5 August . These two deaths compared favourably with those on other transports , particularly Alexander ; Alexander recorded 30 deaths , a consequence of overcrowding and an overflowing bilge . 
 Convict discipline was also well maintained , except for prostitution between the female convicts and the crew , which was rampant on Prince of Wales , Friendship and Lady Penrhyn . The first recorded punishment of a convict aboard Prince of Wales was in October 1787 , nearly nine months after she had sailed ; six lashes for a woman caught stealing from her fellows while they were " at prayer . " 
 = = = Marines = = = 
 The ship also carried a contingent of 31 marines of the New South Wales Marine Corps , comprising lieutenants Thomas Davey and Thomas <unk> , five non @-@ commissioned officers , and 24 privates . Sixteen of the marines embarked with their wives , and there were six children . Discipline was poor . In June 1787 two marines were court @-@ martialed for disobeying orders ; one received 300 lashes . Later in the voyage , two sergeants refused to share a mess after one insulted the other 's wife . Drunkenness was also common . In June one drunken marine sergeant fell through an open hatchway and injured the pregnant wife of another marine , for which offence he was placed in <unk> for two weeks and then transferred to Alexander . Then in late October , First Lieutenant James Maxwell , who had recently transferred aboard from Charlotte , was found incoherently drunk on duty and promptly returned to Charlotte . 
 Two more children were born to the wives of marines during the voyage . In October 1787 the wife of marine drummer Benjamin Cook died from an unspecified illness and was buried at sea after a brief ceremony . 
 James Scott , a Sergeant of Marines , wrote an account of the voyage in his journals , now held at the State Library of New South Wales 
 = = = Return to England = = = 
 Prince of Wales remained anchored in Sydney Cove for five months after her voyage , while her stores were unloaded . A shipboard inspection during this time found her hull was rotten with shipworm and on 23 May 1788 she was careened on the beach for repairs . In July she was released from government service and set sail for England on the 14th of that month , in convoy with her First Fleet sister ships Alexander , Borrowdale and Friendship , and under the overall command of Lieutenant John Shortland in Alexander . 
 The plan was that the convoy sail north to rendezvous at Lord Howe Island , then set a course broadly parallel to the Great Barrier Reef with the aim of reaching the Dutch port of Batavia . From there the convoy would sail west through the Sunda Straits to the Cape of Good Hope , then north through the Atlantic to England . This route was comparatively well mapped – the first part largely mirroring that of James Cook in his first voyage in the Pacific from 1768 to 1771 , and the remainder from Batavia being the traditional route of Dutch East Indiamen returning to Europe . Shortland estimated the voyage would take the convoy between six and ten months . 
 This navigation plan was abandoned when both Prince of Wales and Borrowdale lost sight of Alexander and Friendship during a severe storm in late July , and found themselves alone and off course by the time the weather cleared . The two lost ships anchored while their masters , John Mason in Prince of Wales and Hobson Reed in Borrowdale , consulted . Neither considered it likely they could reach the Lord Howe Island rendezvous . They were also reluctant to hazard the voyage to Batavia through the Great Barrier Reef without Alexander in the lead . Instead , they agreed to turn their ships southeast into the open ocean and to return to England by sailing the other way around the world , via Cape Horn and Rio de Janeiro and then northeast across the Atlantic to Europe . 
 The Pacific weather proved favourable but by August the two ships had lost sight of each other and continued their voyage separately . On 23 August Prince of Wales rounded Cape Horn alone and headed northeast and north on a path to Rio . Throughout the voyage her crew had been heavily reliant on a diet of salted meat and by early September scurvy had incapacitated the majority . Mason died from the condition on 9 October , and another 13 men were too ill to leave their bunks . When Rio was finally sighted on 13 October the crew were too sick to bring the ship to port . She drifted helplessly in the outer harbor until Rio 's harbourmaster sighted her the following morning and had additional seamen rowed out to assist . Twelve of Prince of Wales ' sickest crew members were hospitalised in Rio while the remainder recovered on board . 
 A resupplied Prince of Wales set sail from Rio on Christmas Day 1788 , completing an uneventful final leg to reach Falmouth in England on 25 March 1789 . Despite the delays of disease , weather and an unfamiliar route , she was the first of the Fleet to return home , two months ahead of Alexander which did not reach England until 28 May .

 Between 1790 and into 1793 @-@ 4 Mather & Co. employed Prince of Wales as a whaler in the South Seas Fisheries , under the command of Captain F. Bolton . In 1790 she left for the Brazil Banks and Africa Grounds , but returned in November . By 10 August 1791 she was " All well " at <unk> ( Walvis ) Bay . In April 1792 Prince of Wales returned to England ; she sailed again in July . She sailed around Cape Horn to Peru , but returned to England by late in 1793 . 
 = = Privateer = = 
 Mather & Co. sold Prince of Wales to Clayton Tarleton in 1793 . Tarleton armed her with twenty 6 @-@ pounder guns and placed her under the command of William Scales . Scales received a letter of marque on 1 March 1793 . The letter indicated that Prince of Wales had a crew of 100 men , many more than she needed to sail her , suggesting that Tarleton intended her to sail as a privateer . 
 Prince of Wales departed on a cruise and on 7 April she captured the French merchant vessel " Le <unk> " , which was sailing from Cap @-@ François to Bordeaux with a cargo valued at £ 40 @,@ 000 , or £ 32 @,@ 000 . Prince of Wales brought her prize into Hoylake a week later . 
 Plans changed , and Tarleton appointed Captain James Thomson ( or Thompson ) to command of Prince of Wales , with the intent of sailing her on the Liverpool @-@ Africa trade , i.e. , as a slaver . James Thomson received a letter of marque on 4 September 1793 . His letter indicated that he would have a crew of 40 men . 
 In late 1793 , Thompson sailed from Viana ( probably Viana do Castello , Portugal ) , for Dartmouth , in company with the Somme . On 8 October he captured the Maryland , which was sailing from Baltimore to Bordeaux with a cargo of coffee , sugar , and barrel staves . He sent her into " Montserrat " . In December he recaptured the Best , which had been sailing from Lancaster to the West Indies when a French man @-@ of @-@ war had captured her . Thompson brought Best into the Mersey . 
 On 1 January 1794 , Thomson spoke with a ship that was sailing for Botany Bay . The ship had encountered a French privateer , of 14 guns , which the British ship managed to drive off after an engagement that lasted almost two hours . Reportedly , Prince of Wales went on to recapture a British brig that a French 74 @-@ gun ship of the line had captured . Prince of Wales sent the brig into Oporto . However , this may have been the Best . Lastly , in early 1974 , Prince of Wales captured and brought in the <unk> , of Malmö , which had been carrying wine , brandy , and bale goods from Bordeaux to Saint @-@ Domingue . 
 = = <unk> and capture = = 
 Later in 1794 a new captain replaced Thomson . Radcliffe Shimmin received a letter of marque on 11 June 1794 . A database of slave voyages by Liverpool @-@ registered ships also names Shimmin as master of Prince of Wales . 
 Shimmin 's voyage was ill @-@ fated . Lloyd 's List reported that as Prince of Wales was approaching Barbados , having sailed from West Africa for the West Indies , she encountered a French privateer . The privateer , possibly built in Baltimore , was armed with 28 guns and carried a crew of 300 men . She captured Prince of Wales and took her into Saint Thomas , then a Danish colony , and hence <unk> the capture took place in late 1794 or early 1795 . 
 Unsurprisingly , there is no listing for Prince of Wales in Lloyd 's Register in 1796 . 
 = = British merchantman = = 
 What is perhaps more surprising is that Prince of Wales returned to British ownership . There is an entry for her in the supplemental ( i.e. , late addition ) pages for the 1797 volume . One suspects that the Royal Navy recaptured her in the West Indies , but so far evidence for the conjecture is lacking . 
 Barclay and Co. sailed Prince of Wales between the West Indies and London , and particularly Martinique and London , from 1797 to 1800 . They then sold her to <unk> & Co . Under the command of Captain " <unk> " , she sailed between London and the Mediterranean between 1801 and 1805 . In 1806 Prince of Wales received a large repair and new deck and sides . <unk> also rearmed her with six 6 @-@ pounder guns . From 1805 or so , she was under the command of Captain Stoker , who then sailed in the London @-@ St Vincent trade . She was still listed as sailing in 1810 .

 Lloyd 's Register is only as accurate as the information owners gave it , and there are discrepancies between the entries for vessels and information from other sources .

 In 2009 , the fate of the Garbage Museum became uncertain due to financial problems when the recycling plant 's contracts expired on June 30 and the commodity prices dropped due to the economic recession . The museum began fundraising efforts and started collecting $ 2 for entrance fees in September 2008 . The United States Internal Revenue Service also ruled that museum donations could be tax @-@ deductible increasing opportunities for fundraising . The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority also applied for federal funding as a " shovel @-@ ready " project to upgrade and automate the recycling center 's operations . In 2009 , <unk> stated that the museum 's operational costs were between $ 200 @,@ 000 and $ 250 @,@ 000 per year . Interest in the museum also came from a group of East Haven High School students who produced a short documentary video about the Garbage Museum , it went on to win a state award and attract some international interest . 
 Prior to its close in 2011 , the operating budget was $ 341 @,@ 000 , which funded staffing , educational programs , and the museum 's heating and lighting .

 The 96th Boat Race took place on 1 April 1950 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . The Cambridge crew contained three Olympic silver medallists from the 1948 Summer Olympics ; six of their crew rowed for Lady Margaret Boat Club . In a race umpired by the Olympic medallist and former <unk> rower Kenneth Payne , Cambridge won by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 15 seconds , taking the overall record in the event to 52 – 43 in their favour . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and , as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1949 race by a quarter of a length , with Cambridge leading overall with 51 victories to Oxford 's 43 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Cambridge were coached by R. Beesly ( who had rowed for the Light Blues in the 1927 , 1928 and 1929 races ) , Roy Meldrum ( a coach for Lady Margaret Boat Club ) , Mike Nicholson ( non @-@ rowing boat club president for the 1947 race ) , Harold Rickett ( who rowed three times between 1930 and 1932 ) and R. H. H. Symonds ( who had rowed in the 1931 race ) . Oxford 's coaches were T. A. Brocklebank ( who had rowed for Cambridge three times between 1929 and 1931 and who had also coached the Light Blues in the 1934 race ) , R. E. Eason ( a Dark Blue in the 1924 race ) , Hugh " Jumbo " Edwards ( who rowed for Oxford in 1926 and 1930 ) and J. A. MacNabb ( who rowed for Cambridge in the 1924 race ) . The race was umpired for the second time by the former British Olympian Kenneth Payne , who had rowed for Cambridge in the 1932 and 1934 races . 
 The Light Blues were initially considered " hot favourites " and were described by the rowing correspondent of The Manchester Guardian as " full of brilliant promise " while Oxford were " a collection of competent oarsmen who had to be moulded into a crew " . The Observer 's G. I. F. Thomson suggested that " it is anyone 's race " . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 12 st 8 @.@ 25 lb ( 79 @.@ 8 kg ) , 4 @.@ 75 pounds ( 2 @.@ 2 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Oxford saw three rowers return to the boat with experience of the event , including number five G. C. Fisk who was rowing in his third consecutive Boat Race . Cambridge 's crew contained five rowers who had taken part in the Boat Race previously , including Paul Bircher who was also making his third appearance in the race . Four of the participants in the race were registered as non @-@ British , two in each crew . Oxford 's Fisk and Calvert came from Australia , as did Cambridge 's Charles Lloyd , while Light Blue W. T. Arthur was South African . 
 The Cambridge crew contained three rowers who had won silver medals at the 1948 Summer Olympics : Paul Massey , Bircher and Lloyd were in the crew that came second in the men 's eight in London . Chris Davidge , the Oxford University Boat Club president , was forced to drop out of the race through illness . Five of the Oxford rowers were educated at Eton College ; six of the Cambridge rowers were studying at St John 's College and so rowed for Lady Margaret Boat Club . 
 = = Race = = 
 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge . Umpire Payne started the race at 12 : 30 p.m. , with the Dark Blues making a slightly faster start ; after a minute they were about a canvas @-@ length ahead of their opponents . Although having the outside of the first bend , they had extended their lead to a quarter of a length by Craven Cottage . By the time the crews passed the Mile Post , Cambridge were leading by a quarter @-@ length which they extended to half a length by Harrods Furniture Depository . Cambridge 's stroke Crick increased his crew 's rate ; his opposite number Cavenagh responded to prevent the Light Blues going clear . 
 While the conditions were not too rough , both crews slowed their stroke rate , with Cambridge passing below Hammersmith Bridge still half a length ahead . As they passed The Doves pub , Oxford slowly began to gain , rating marginally higher . Cavenagh pushed on again before Chiswick Eyot but could not prevent the Light Blues extending their lead to nearly a length by the time the crews passed Chiswick Steps . Despite further spurts from Oxford , Cambridge 's " better stride " saw them pass below Barnes Bridge two and a half lengths ahead . Cambridge passed the finishing post leading by three and a half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 15 seconds , their fourth consecutive win in the slowest time since the 1947 race . The victory took the overall record in the event to 52 – 43 in their favour . The rowing correspondent for The Times noted that " Cambridge rowed far better than they have recently " while " Oxford surpassed what anyone could reasonably have expected from them . " The Manchester Guardian 's rowing correspondent declared that Cambridge 's crew was " generally acknowledged to be one of the best seen on the tideway " , and that " Oxford could not , short of shipwreck or piracy , win the race " . Writing in The Observer , G. I. F. Thomson noted of Cambridge that " all through practice they had shown more promising form and power , as well as unity " while Oxford had " made great strides ... and were never out of the running .

 = Sandsfoot Castle = 
 Sandsfoot Castle , also known historically as Weymouth Castle , is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII near Weymouth , Dorset . It formed part of the King 's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire , and defended the Weymouth Bay anchorage . The stone castle had an octagonal gun platform , linked to a residential blockhouse , and was completed by 1542 at a cost of £ 3 @,@ 887 . <unk> defences were built around the landward side of the castle , probably in 1623 . Sandsfoot saw service during the English Civil War , when it was held by Parliament and Royalists in turn during the conflict . It survived the interregnum but , following Charles II 's restoration to the throne , the fortress was withdrawn from military use in 1665 . 
 By the early 18th century , Sandsfoot was in ruins , its stonework taken for use in local building projects . The clay cliffs on which the castle had been built had always been unstable and subject to erosion . The castle 's gun platform began to collapse into the sea and , by the 1950s , had been entirely destroyed . The ruins were closed to visitors on safety grounds , although civic gardens were planted alongside it in 1951 . Repairs were undertaken between 2009 and 2012 at a total cost of £ 217 @,@ 800 , enabling the site to be reopened to the public . Historic England considers Sandsfoot to be " one of the most substantial examples " of the 16th @-@ century blockhouses to survive in England . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 16th century = = = 
 Sandsfoot Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities , only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Modest defences , based around simple blockhouses and towers , existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , with a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale . 
 After 1533 , Henry broke with popes Pope Clement VII and Paul III in order to annul the long @-@ standing marriage to his wife , Catherine of Aragon , and remarry . Catherine was the aunt of Charles V , the Holy Roman Emperor , and Charles took the annulment as a personal insult . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England . An invasion of England appeared certain . In response , Henry issued an order , called a " device " , in 1539 , giving instructions for the " defence of the realm in time of invasion " and the construction of forts along the English coastline . 
 Sandsfoot Castle was built to protect the Weymouth Bay anchorage , being placed on cliffs overlooking the waterway , opposite Portland Castle on the other side . Sandsfoot was a blockhouse , intended to defeat enemy ships using a battery of heavy artillery , and had minimal protection against an attack from the land . It was completed by 1541 , run by a captain appointed by the Crown , and cost £ 3 @,@ 887 to build . There was probably an early agreement that the nearby village of Wyke Regis had a responsibility to support the castle , and in exchange they came to traditionally enjoy an exemption from taxes and militia duties . The antiquarian John Leland visited the castle soon after its construction , describing it as " a right <unk> and <unk> castle " with " one open barbican " , probably referring to the castle 's gun platform . 
 Coastal erosion quickly began to threaten the castle , causing what was reported as a " great gulf " on its seaward side , and repairs costing £ 383 were necessary by 1583 . During the invasion scare that accompanied the Spanish Armada of 1588 , the normal garrison of Sandsfoot was supplemented by another 50 men . 
 = = = 17th – 19th centuries = = = 
 Repairs were made to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain , Sir George <unk> , at a cost of £ 211 . A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard <unk> showed the castle to be equipped with ten iron guns – one culverin , five demi @-@ culverins , two sakers , a minion and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain , five gunners and three soldiers . It was in a poor condition , and one corner of the gun platform had been undermined by the sea ; <unk> 's team estimated the likely costs of repairs to amount to £ 459 . 
 During the English Civil War between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament , Weymouth was predominantly Parliamentarian in loyalty and the surrounding forts were held by their garrisons . Robert Dormer , the Earl of Carnarvon , entered Dorset with an army in 1643 and Weymouth surrendered , resulting in Sandsfoot Castle being controlled by the Royalists between August 1643 and June 1644 . During this period the castle may have been used as a Royalist mint . Robert Devereux , the Earl of Essex , then retook the county for Parliament ; Colonel William Ashburnham , the Royalist governor of Weymouth , retreated to Portland Castle without a fight . Devereux approached Sandsfoot and , after three hours of negotiations , the fort surrendered to him . In 1647 , Parliament ordered the garrison at the castle to be demobilised but this did not occur , and John Hayne was appointed as its new captain . 
 Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 and the next year a fresh order was given to demobilise the garrison at Sandsfoot . An argument then broke out between Humphrey Weld , the lieutenant @-@ governor of Portland and captain of Sandsfoot Castle , and Charles Stewart , the Duke of Richmond , over the control of the local defences . The village of Wyke Regis petitioned Weld in a bid to prevent the demobilisation , concerned that their traditional exemptions from militia service would be revoked by the Duke . Weld championed their case but was dismissed from his post as lieutenant @-@ governor , and the Duke occupied Sandsfoot with his militia . Weld appealed to the government and in 1665 a compromise was announced in which Weld would be reappointed to his role as lieutenant @-@ governor , while Sandsfoot would be declared redundant and be demolished . The order for its destruction was never carried out , and the castle was used as a storehouse until at least 1691 . 
 By 1725 , the castle had become ruinous . Early in the century , the remains of the castle was sold to the town of Weymouth , whose people reused some of the stone to construct their new town bridge . Local tradition in the 19th century maintained that several houses in Weymouth were also constructed using stone taken from the castle . In 1825 , the carved stone Elizabethan arms of the castle were moved to All Saints Church in Wyke Regis . Captains continued to be formally appointed , however , and Gabriel Stewart held the post as late as 1795 . 
 The majority of the gun platform collapsed into the sea as the cliffs eroded . It is uncertain precisely when this occurred ; in a prolonged historical debate over this during the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the historian Henry Symonds argued that the first falls occurred during the 18th century , W. Norman placed the main fall in 1835 , and T. Groves argued in favour of a more recent collapse in the second half of the 19th century . The ruined castle was drawn and painted by various artists in the 18th and 19th centuries , including Samuel Buck , J. H. Grimm , C. Sawyer and Edward Pritchard . The castle featured in Joseph Drew 's short novel " the Poisoned Cup " in 1876 . 
 = = = 20th – 21st centuries = = = 
 In 1902 , the Weymouth Corporation purchased the castle for the town from the Department of Woods and Forests for a total of £ 150 . During the Second World War the castle probably housed an anti @-@ aircraft battery as part of the defences created around Portland Harbour . Despite the construction of the Portland breakwaters nearby , the unstable clay cliffs remained vulnerable to erosion ; in 1930 the ruins were closed to the public due to safety concerns and the remaining embrasure of the gun platform collapsed during in the 1950s . 
 In 2009 , £ 23 @,@ 100 was awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund for an initial survey of the site , which by now had been placed on English Heritage 's register of listed buildings at risk of decline , followed by a further £ 194 @,@ 700 in 2011 for substantial repair work . As part of the work , a three @-@ dimensional laser scan of the stonework was undertaken , and a steel and oak walkway was installed around the interior of the castle . The castle reopened to the public in 2012 , and the following year it was removed from English Heritage 's at risk register . The castle is protected under UK law as a grade II * listed building and as a scheduled ancient monument . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Sandsfoot Castle was built from Portland stone with ashlar facings and a rubble core . It comprised a main blockhouse attached to an octagonal gun room , overlooking the sea . The two @-@ storey blockhouse is 42 by 32 feet ( 12 @.@ 8 by 9 @.@ 8 m ) across , with a gate @-@ tower on its landward side . It probably originally had four rooms for the accommodation and cooking facilities for the garrison , with staircases leading up to the first floor and down into its basement . The gate @-@ tower held a small room on the first floor and was designed to hold a portcullis . The one @-@ storey gun room was approximately 36 by 28 feet ( 11 @.@ 0 by 8 @.@ 5 m ) across with five embrasures for guns and a flat roof that also probably supported artillery . Both the gun room and the main block were probably protected by parapets . 
 The gun room has been lost to erosion , although the south @-@ western embrasure is still visible where it fell onto the beach below . The ashlar facings of the blockhouse have been largely robbed , although some elements remain , and the roof and floors have been lost . Historic England considers that the castle " represents one of the most substantial examples " of an unaltered 16th @-@ century blockhouse in England . 
 The castle originally had an outer ward , reached over a bridge , and stables , although these have been both been lost . Protective rectangular earthworks were constructed to protect the castle on the landward side , probably in 1623 , with two bastions in the north and west corners , and some form of stone structure along the earthworks . In the 18th century these earthworks were described as forming a " deep trench " and mid @-@ 19th century accounts suggested that they were around 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) deep . Now only 100 feet ( 30 m ) of the bank and ditch survives , with the earthworks approximately 10 metres ( 33 ft ) wide overall and 2 @.@ 2 metres ( 7 ft 3 in ) deep between the top of the bank and the base of the ditch . The north bastion still survives largely intact , although the west has been mostly destroyed . Outside the entrance to the earthworks are the Sandsfoot Gardens , civic gardens dating from 1951 , designed in a Tudor style with an ornamental pond . 
 = Salvia divinorum = 
 Salvia divinorum ( also known as sage of the diviners , ska <unk> <unk> , seer 's sage , yerba de la <unk> and just salvia ) is a psychoactive plant which can induce visions and other altered and spiritual experiences . Its native habitat is in cloud forest in the isolated Sierra Mazateca of Oaxaca , Mexico , where it grows in shady and moist locations . The plant grows to over a meter high , has hollow square stems , large leaves , and occasional white flowers with violet <unk> . Botanists have not determined whether Salvia divinorum is a cultigen or a hybrid ; native plants reproduce vegetatively , rarely producing viable seed . 
 Mazatec shamans have a long and continuous tradition of religious use of Salvia divinorum , using it to facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions . Most of the plant 's local common names allude to the Mazatecs ' post @-@ Columbian belief that the plant is an incarnation of the Virgin Mary , with its ritual use also invoking that relationship . 
 Its chief active psychoactive constituent is a structurally unique diterpenoid called salvinorin A , a potent κ @-@ opioid and D2 receptor agonist . Salvia divinorum is generally understood to be of low toxicity ( high LD50 ) and low addictive potential since it is a κ @-@ opioid agonist and a great deal of research has indicated that κ @-@ opioid agonist activation of the kappa opioid receptor as shown by salvia may , in fact , serve as a potent addiction treatment therapy . 
 Salvia divinorum remains legal in most countries and , within the United States , is legal in the majority of states . However , some have called for its prohibition . While not currently regulated by US federal drug laws , several states have passed laws criminalizing the substance . Some proposed state bills have failed to progress and have not been made into law ( with motions having been voted down or otherwise dying in committee stages ) . There have not been many publicized prosecutions of individuals violating anti @-@ salvia laws in the few jurisdictions in which it is prohibited . 
 = = History = = 
 Salvia divinorum is native to the Sierra Mazateca in Oaxaca , Mexico , where it is still used by the Mazatec , primarily to facilitate shamanic visions in the context of curing or divination . S. divinorum is one of several species with hallucinogenic properties that are ritually used by Mazatec shamans . Others include certain morning glory seeds ( <unk> corymbosa ) , psilocybin mushrooms , and various <unk> species . In their rituals , the shamans use only fresh S. divinorum leaves . They see the plant as an incarnation of the Virgin Mary , and begin the ritual with an invocation to Mary , Saint Peter , the Holy Trinity , and other saints . Ritual use traditionally involves being in a quiet place after ingestion of the leaf — the <unk> shamans say that " La Maria ( S. divinorum ) speaks with a quiet voice . " 
 It is also used remedially at lower dosages as a diuretic , and to treat ailments including diarrhea , anemia , headaches , rheumatism , and a semi @-@ magical disease known as <unk> de <unk> , or a swollen belly ( literally , " lamb belly " ) . 
 The history of the plant is not well known , and there has been no definitive answer to the question of its origin . Speculation includes Salvia divinorum being a wild plant native to the area ; a cultigen of the Mazatecs ; or a cultigen introduced by another indigenous group . Botanists have also not been able to determine whether it is a hybrid or a cultigen . 
 = = = Academic discovery = = = 
 Salvia divinorum was first recorded in print by Jean Basset Johnson in 1939 while he was studying Mazatec shamanism . He later documented its usage and reported its effects through personal testimonials . It was not until the 1990s that the psychoactive mechanism was identified by a team led by Daniel Siebert . 
 Gordon Wasson tentatively postulated that the plant could be the mythological <unk> , the " Noble Prince " of the Aztec codices . Wasson 's speculation has been the subject of further debate amongst ethnobotanists , with some scepticism coming from Leander J. Valdés , and counterpoints more supportive of Wasson 's theory from Jonathan Ott . 
 The identity of another mysterious Aztec entheogen , namely that of <unk> , has also been suggested as being Salvia divinorum . Here too there are other candidate plants , notably <unk> ( <unk> funebris ) , again suggesting that there is no consensus . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The genus name , Salvia , was first used by Pliny for a plant that was likely Salvia officinalis ( common sage ) and is derived from the Latin <unk> . The specific epithet , divinorum , was given because of the plant 's traditional use in divination and <unk> it is often loosely translated as " diviner 's sage " or " seer 's sage " . Albert Hofmann , who collected the first plants with Wasson , objected to the new plant being given the name divinorum : 
 I was not very happy with the name because Salvia divinorum means " Salvia of the ghosts " , whereas Salvia <unk> , the correct name , means " Salvia of the priests " , But it is now in the botanical literature under the name Salvia divinorum . 
 There are many common names for S. divinorum , most of them relating to the plant 's association with the Virgin Mary . The Mazatec believe the plant to be an incarnation of the Virgin Mary , so they take great care in handling the plant . The name " Ska Maria Pastora " , often shortened to " Ska Maria " or " Ska Pastora " , refers to " the leaf or herb of Mary , the Shepherdess . " Other Spanish names include " hojas de Maria " , " hojas de la Pastora " , " <unk> ( yerba ) Maria " , and " la Maria " . A plant believed to be S. divinorum was referred to as " <unk> de <unk> " ( leaf of prophecy ) by the <unk> and Mazatec . S. divinorum is also known as la <unk> ( " the female " ) , when it is included by the Mazatec as part of a family of similar religious hallucinogens . The others it is connected with are Coleus pumila , called el macho ( " the male " ) , and two forms of Coleus <unk> which are called el <unk> ( " the child " ) and el <unk> ( " the godson " ) . 
 Some researchers see the lack of an indigenous Mazatec name as demonstrating a non @-@ Mazatec origin for the plant . Others point out that the Virgin Mary is not normally viewed as a shepherdess in Christianity , and that image may hint at a pre @-@ Hispanic Mazatec cultural reference to the plant . 
 = = = Recent history = = = 
 Salvia divinorum has become both increasingly well @-@ known and available in modern culture . The Internet has allowed for the growth of many businesses selling live salvia plants , dried leaves , extracts , and other preparations . 
 Medical experts , as well as accident and emergency rooms , have not been reporting cases that suggest particular salvia @-@ related health concerns , and police have not been reporting it as a significant issue with regard to public order offences ; in any case , Salvia divinorum has attracted negative attention from the media and some lawmakers . 
 Media stories generally raise alarms over Salvia divinorum 's legal status and are sometimes headlined with generally ill @-@ supported comparisons to LSD or other psychoactive substances . Parental concerns are raised by focusing on salvia 's usage by younger teens — the emergence of YouTube videos purporting to depict its use being an area of particular concern in this respect . The isolated and controversial suicide of Brett Chidester received much media attention . 
 Salvia divinorum was the subject of the first use of YouTube within drug @-@ behavioral research when scientists at San Diego State University rated randomly selected videos of salvia users to study observed impairment . Their findings corroborate reports that the most profound effects of smoking salvia appear almost immediately and last about eight minutes . Effects include temporary speech and coordination loss . 
 = = Botany = = 
 Salvia divinorum has large green ovate ( often also dentate ) leaves , with a yellow undertone that reach 10 to 30 cm ( 4 to 12 in ) long . The leaves have no hairs on either surface , and little or no petiole . The plant grows to well over 1 metre ( 3 ft ) in height , on hollow square stems which tend to break or trail on the ground , with the plant rooting quite readily at the nodes and internodes . 
 The flowers , which bloom only rarely , grow in whorls on a 30 @-@ centimetre ( 12 in ) inflorescence , with about six flowers to each whorl . The 3 @-@ centimetre ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) flowers are white , curved and covered with hairs , and held in a small violet calyx that is covered in hairs and glands . When it does bloom in its native habitat , it does so from September to May . 
 Early authors erred in describing the flowers as having blue corollas , based on Epling and Játiva 's description . The first plant material they received was dried , so they based the flower color on an erroneous description by Hofmann and Wasson , who didn 't realize that their " blue flowers , crowned with a white dome " were in fact violet <unk> with unopened white corollas . 
 = = = Distribution and habitat = = = 
 Salvia divinorum is endemic to the Sierra Mazateca in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico , growing in the primary or secondary cloud forest and tropical evergreen forest at elevations from 300 to 1 @,@ 830 metres ( 980 to 6 @,@ 000 ft ) . Its most common habitat is black soil along stream banks where small trees and bushes provide an environment of low light and high humidity . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Salvia divinorum produces few viable seeds even when it does flower — no seeds have ever been observed on plants in the wild . For an unknown reason , pollen fertility is also comparatively reduced . There is no active pollen tube inhibition within the style , but some event or process after the pollen tube reaches the ovary is aberrant . The likeliest explanations are inbreeding depression or hybridity . All of the Mazatec populations appear to be clonal . The plant 's square stems break easily and tend to trail on the ground , rooting easily at the nodes and internodes . 
 = = = Taxonomy = = = 
 Salvia divinorum was first documented in 1939 , but it was many years before botanists could identify the plant due to Mazatec secrecy about the growing sites . Flowers were needed for a definitive identification of the species . In 1962 , the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann , and ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson , traveled throughout the Sierra Mazateca researching Mazatec rituals and looking for specimens of the plant . They were unable to locate live plants . Eventually , the Mazatec provided them some flowering specimens . These specimens were sent to botanists Carl Epling and Carlos D. Játiva , who described and named the plant as Salvia divinorum , after its use in divination and healing by the Mazatec . By 1985 , up to fifteen populations of the plant had been found . 
 Until 2010 , there were differing opinions on whether Salvia divinorum is an interspecific hybrid . The plant 's partial sterility was suggestive of a hybrid origin , though no two parent species have been found with an obvious affinity to Salvia divinorum . One other possibility for the plant 's partial sterility is that long @-@ term cultivation and selection have produced an inbred cultigen . 
 In 2010 , a molecular phylogenetic approach by DNA sequencing of Salvia divinorum and a number of related species strongly suggest that the species is not a hybrid . One earlier proposed parent was Salvia cyanea ( a synonym for Salvia concolor ) , which Epling and Játiva believed to be closely allied to Salvia divinorum . The 2010 study demonstrated Salvia divinorum 's closest relative to be Salvia <unk> — a rare and endemic Salvia that is native to Colombia , growing in shaded , wooded gullies at 1 @,@ 500 to 2 @,@ 000 m ( 4 @,@ 900 to 6 @,@ 600 ft ) elevation . It also showed that Salvia divinorum does not belong to the Salvia section <unk> , as believed earlier . The genetic study also indicated that Salvia <unk> was likely misplaced into Salvia section <unk> , and that it may not be related to other Colombia Salvia species , though further tests are needed . 
 The origin of Salvia divinorum is still a mystery , one of only three plants in the extensive Salvia genus ( approximately 900 species ) with unknown origins — the other two are Salvia <unk> and Salvia <unk> . 
 = = = Strains = = = 
 There are two commonly cultivated strains which are known to be distinct .

The other was collected from Huautla de Jiménez in 1991 by anthropologist Bret Blosser ( the Blosser or <unk> strain ) . There are other strains that are not as well documented , such as the Luna strain ( possibly Bunnell ) isolated from a Hawaiian patch of Salvia divinorum clones , featuring unusually serrated and rounded rather than ovate leaves .

 The known active constituent of Salvia divinorum is a trans @-@ <unk> diterpenoid known as salvinorin A ( chemical formula <unk> ) . This compound is present in the dried plant at about 0 @.@ 18 % . 
 Salvinorin A is not an alkaloid , ( meaning it does not contain a basic nitrogen ) , unlike most known opioid receptor ligands . Salvinorin A is the first documented <unk> hallucinogen . 
 Similar to many psychoactive herbs , Salvia divinorum synthesizes and excretes its active constituent ( salvinorin A ) via trichomes , of the peltate @-@ glandular morphology , located just beneath the cuticle ( <unk> ) layer . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 By mass , salvinorin A " is the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen . " It is active at doses as low as 200 µg . Synthetic chemicals , such as LSD ( active at 20 – 30 µg doses ) , can be more potent . Research has shown that salvinorin A is a potent and selective κ @-@ Opioid ( kappa @-@ Opioid ) receptor agonist . It has been reported that the effects of salvinorin A in mice are blocked by κ @-@ Opioid receptor antagonists . However , it is an even more potent D2 receptor partial agonist , and it is likely this action plays a significant role in its effects as well . Salvinorin A has no actions at the 5 @-@ HT2A serotonin receptor , the principal molecular target responsible for the actions of ' classic ' hallucinogens , such as mescaline and LSD , nor is it known to have affinity for any other sites to date . 
 Salvinorin 's potency should not be confused with toxicity . Rodents chronically exposed to dosages many times greater than those to which humans are exposed show no signs of organ damage . 
 = = = Other terpenoids = = = 
 Other terpenoids have been isolated from Salvia divinorum , including other <unk> and related compounds named <unk> and <unk> . None of these compounds has shown significant ( sub @-@ micromolar ) affinity at the κ @-@ Opioid receptor , and there is no evidence that they contribute to the plant 's psychoactivity . 
 = = = Other pharmaceutical action = = = 
 Salvinorin A is capable of inhibiting excess intestinal motility ( e.g. diarrhea ) , through a combination of κ @-@ opioid and cannabinoid ( mainly CB1 receptor ) receptors in inflamed but not normal gut in vivo . The mechanism of action for Salvinorin A on ileal tissue has been described as ' <unk> ' , as it was able to modify electrically induced contractions , but not those of exogenous acetylcholine . Results from a small study by an assistant professor at the University of Iowa indicate that it may have potential as an analgesic and as a therapeutic tool for treating drug addictions . 
 A pharmacologically important aspect of the contraction @-@ reducing ( antispasmodic ) properties of ingested Salvinorin A on gut tissue is that it is only pharmacologically active on inflamed and not normal tissue , thus reducing possible side @-@ effects . 
 = = Ingestion = = 
 There are a few ways to consume Salvia divinorum . In traditional Mazatec ritual , shamans use only fresh Salvia divinorum leaves . Modern methods have been developed to more effectively absorb the active principle , salvinorin A. If enough salvinorin A is absorbed , an altered state of consciousness can occur . The duration of experience varies with the method of ingestion and the amount of salvinorin A absorbed . 
 = = = Traditional methods = = = 
 Mazatec shamans crush the leaves to extract leaf juices from about 20 to 80 ( about <unk> / 2 oz to <unk> / 7 oz . ) or more fresh leaves . They usually mix these juices with water to create an infusion or ' tea ' which they drink to induce visions in ritual healing ceremonies . 
 Chewing and swallowing a large number of fresh leaves is the other Mazatec method . Oral consumption of the leaf makes the effects come on more slowly , over a period of 10 to 20 minutes . The experience , from the onset of effects , lasts from about 30 minutes up to one and a half hours . 
 Doses for chewing vastly exceed doses used for smoking . By calculating the concentrations per leaf ( " an average concentration of 2 @.@ 45 mg per gram " of leaf ) , the average weight per leaf ( " about 50 g " per 20 leaves , or <unk> / leaf ) , and the standard dose for chewing ( about 8 @-@ 28 leaves ) , the doses can range from about 50 mg to 172 mg . 
 = = = Modern methods = = = 
 Modern methods of ingestion include smoking or chewing the leaf , or using a tincture , as described in the following sections . 
 Salvia divinorum is becoming more widely known and used in modern culture . The National Survey on Drug Use and Health , an annual US based survey sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA ) , for 2006 estimated that about 1 @.@ 8 million persons aged 12 or older had used Salvia divinorum in their lifetime , of which approximately 750 @,@ 000 had done so in that year . The following year , 2007 , saw the annual figure rise from 750 @,@ 000 to 1 million US users . 
 = = = = Smoking = = = = 
 Dry leaves can be smoked in a pipe , or through the use of a water pipe to cool the smoke . The temperature required to release salvinorin from the plant material is quite high ( about 240 ° C ) . A cooler flame will work , but the direct application of a more intense flame , such as that of a torch lighter , is often preferred . 
 Some find that untreated dry leaf produces unnoticeable or only light effects . Concentrated preparations or extracts which may be smoked in place of untreated leaves , have become widely available . This enhanced ( or " fortified " ) leaf is described by a number followed by an x ( e.g. 5x , 10x ) , the multiplicative factors being generally indicative of the relative amounts of leaf concentrate , though there is no accepted standard for these claims . Other sources may use a system of color codes to form their own standards of potency ; for example , " green " , " yellow " , and " red . " 
 These grades of potency may be roughly indicative of the relative concentration of the active principle , ( salvinorin A ) , but the measure should not be taken as absolute . Overall extract potency will depend on the ( naturally varying ) strength of the untreated leaf used in preparing the extract , as well as the efficiency of the extraction process itself . Extracts reduce the overall amount of inhalations needed to ingest a given amount of active principle , thus facilitating more powerful experiences . 
 If salvia is smoked , then the main effects are experienced quickly . The most intense ' peak ' is reached within a minute or so and lasts for 1 – 5 minutes , followed by a gradual tapering off . At 5 – 10 minutes , less intense yet still noticeable effects typically persist , giving way to a returning sense of the everyday and familiar until back to baseline after about 15 to 20 minutes . 
 = = = = Quid chewing = = = = 
 The traditional method of chewing the leaves has continued in modern use . However , salvinorin A is generally considered to be inactive when orally ingested , as salvinorin A is effectively deactivated by the gastrointestinal system . Therefore , in what 's understood to be a modern innovation , the ' quid ' of leaves is held in the mouth as long as possible in order to facilitate absorption of the active constituents through the oral mucosa . ' Quid ' refers to the fact that at the end of this method the user spits out the leaves rather than swallowing them because ingesting the leaves has no known effect . Chewing consumes more of the plant than smoking , and produces a longer @-@ lasting experience . 
 = = = = Using a tincture = = = = 
 Less commonly , some may ingest salvia in the form of a tincture . This is administered <unk> , usually with the aid of a glass dropper . It may be taken diluted with water just before use , which may slightly reduce the intensity of its effects , but can also serve to lessen or avoid a stinging sensation in the mouth caused by the presence of alcohol . <unk> vary in potency , and the effects can range from inducing a mild meditative state to bringing about a more intense visionary one . 
 When taken as a tincture the effects and duration are similar to other methods of oral ingestion , though they may be significantly more intense , depending on extract potency . 
 = = Immediate effects = = 
 Psychedelic experiences are necessarily somewhat subjective and variations in reported effects are to be expected . Aside from individual reported experiences there has been a limited amount of published work summarising the effects . D.M. Turner 's book Salvinorin — The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia <unk> quotes Daniel Siebert 's <unk> , mentioning that the effects may include : 
 Uncontrollable laughter 
 Past memories , such as revisiting places from childhood memory 
 Sensations of motion , or being pulled or twisted by forces 
 Visions of membranes , films , various two @-@ dimensional surfaces , and fractal patterns 
 Merging with or becoming objects 
 Overlapping realities , such as the perception of being in several locations at once 
 There also may be <unk> experiences . <unk> ( speaking in tongues ) has been reported by Reason . 
 A survey of salvia users found that 38 % described the effects as unique in comparison to other methods of altering consciousness . 23 % said the effects were like yoga , meditation or trance . 
 One firsthand journalistic account has been published in the UK science magazine New Scientist ( note : the dose for this experience was not reported ) : 
 The salvia took me on a consciousness @-@ expanding journey unlike any other I have ever experienced . My body felt disconnected from ' me ' and objects and people appeared cartoonish , surreal and marvellous . Then , as suddenly as it had began , it was over . The visions vanished and I was back in my bedroom . I spoke to my ' sitter ' — the friend who was watching over me , as recommended on the packaging — but my mouth was awkward and clumsy . When I attempted to stand my coordination was off . Within a couple of minutes , however , I was fine and clear @-@ headed , though dripping with sweat . The whole experience had lasted less than 5 minutes . 
 There have been few books published on the subject . One notable example is Dale <unk> 's work " <unk> / <unk> — Plant Powers , Poisons , and <unk> " , which won the 1996 Firecracker Alternative Book Award and has a chapter dedicated to Salvia divinorum . It includes some experience accounts : 
 It 's very intense , I call it a reality stutter , or a reality strobing . I think that having been a test pilot , and flying in that unforgiving environment with only two feet between our wingtips , helped to prepare me for this kind of exploration . 
 Other users have written extensive prose and / or poetry about their experiences ; some describe their visions pictorially , and there exist examples of visionary art which are ' salvia @-@ inspired ' . Others claim musical inspiration from the plant : including " Salvia divinorum " by 1200 <unk> , " Salvia " by Deepwater Sunshine , and " Flight 77 " by Paul <unk> . 
 = = = Cautionary notes = = = 
 Dale <unk> expresses some concerns about the use of highly concentrated forms of salvia . In its natural form salvia is more balanced and benevolent , and quite strong enough , he argues . High strength extracts on the other hand can show " a more precipitous , and more terrifying , face " and many who try it this way may never wish to repeat the experience . 
 The Salvia <unk> User 's Guide recommends having a trip sitter present to those who are new to salvia , are experimenting with a stronger form , or are using a more effective method of ingestion . 
 The guide says that while the effects of salvia are generally quite different from those of alcohol , like alcohol , it impairs coordination . It also emphasizes that salvia is not a ' party <unk> 
 Salvia is not ' fun ' in the way that alcohol or cannabis can be . If you try to party with salvia you probably will not have a good experience . Salvia is a consciousness @-@ changing herb that can be used in a vision quest , or in a healing ritual . In the right setting , salvia makes it possible to see visions . It is an herb with a long tradition of sacred use . It is useful for deep meditation . It is best taken in a quiet , nearly dark room ; either alone , or with one or two good friends present .

 Daniel Siebert cautions that inhaling hot air can be irritating and potentially damaging to the lungs . Vapor produced by a heat gun needs to be cooled by running it through a water pipe or cooling chamber before inhalation . 
 The vaporizers that have been reported effective for use with dried S. divinorum leaves are those that use a paint stripper “ heat gun ” as the heat source . These get very hot , and people have reported that they work quite well sometimes too well — for smoking dried S. divinorum leaves ; we have heard of several people using this type of <unk> who had experiences that were too intense , including one report of someone passing out . Measuring an accurate dose with these devices can be quite tricky , and they are not recommended . 
 An experienced salvia user who is chewing a quid , may often choose to do it alone , and may be quite safe in doing so . But having a pleasant , sensible , sober sitter is an absolute must if you are trying vaporization , smoking high doses of extract @-@ enhanced leaves , or using pure salvinorin .

 After the peak effects , normal awareness @-@ of @-@ self and the immediate surroundings return but lingering effects may be felt . These short @-@ term lingering effects have a completely different character than the peak experience . About half of users report a pleasing ' afterglow ' , or pleasant state of mind following the main effects . Researchers from the University of California and California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute conducted a survey of 500 salvia users which identified that they ' sometimes or often ' experience certain effects , including : 
 Other commonly reported effects include :

 Differing studies suggest no consensus so far with regard to the long @-@ term effects of Salvia divinorum on mood . It is well @-@ established that some k @-@ opioid agonists can cause dysphoria in humans . One study using rats in forced @-@ swim tests has been used to suggest that Salvia divinorum may have " depressive @-@ like " effects , although this conclusion has been contradicted by subsequent research . However , a report has been published detailing an individual case of Salvia divinorum use as self @-@ medicated treatment for depression , and Baggott 's survey of 500 people with firsthand experience of salvia found that 25 @.@ 8 % of respondents reported improved mood and " antidepressant @-@ like effects " lasting 24 hours or longer . Only 4 @.@ 4 % reported persisting ( 24 hours or more ) negative effects ( most often anxiety ) on at least one occasion . 
 There has been one report of salvia precipitating psychosis . The authors state that they suspect this patient was genetically predisposed to schizophrenia , but their own clinical report shows no family psychiatric history , no personal psychiatric history , and no abnormal lab results . 
 It has been suggested that the long @-@ term effects of salvia use may include feelings of déjà vu . 
 The Baggott survey found little evidence of addictive potential ( chemical dependence ) in its survey population . 0 @.@ 6 % percent of respondents reported feeling addicted to or dependent on salvia at some point , and 1 @.@ 2 % reported strong cravings . About this the researchers said " there were too few of these individuals to interpret their reports with any confidence " . 
 Most users report no hangover or negative after @-@ effects ( e.g. withdrawal , comedown or rebound effect ) the next day . This is consistent with the apparent low toxicity of salvia indicated by research conducted at the University of Nebraska .

 Salvia researcher Griffith said that from animal testing salvia appears to not be addictive , also the intensity of the experience creates a dysphoria that causes people not to return to the drug . 
 Thomas <unk> , assistant professor of medicinal and natural products chemistry at the University of Iowa , has suggested that salvia may help treat cocaine addiction : 
 You can give a rat free access to cocaine , give them free access to Salvinorin A , and they stop taking cocaine . 
 = = = Therapeutic potential = = = 
 Aside from individual reports of self @-@ medicated use in the treatment of depression , research suggests that Salvia divinorum , in line with the studied effects of other κ @-@ opioid agonists , may have further therapeutic potential . 
 Professor Bryan L. Roth , director of the National Institute on Mental Health 's Psychoactive Drug Screening Program , has said : 
 We think that drugs derived from the active ingredient could be useful for a range of diseases : Alzheimer 's , depression , schizophrenia , chronic pain and even AIDS or HIV . 
 Clinical pharmacologist John Mendelsohn has said : 
 There may be some derivatives that could be made that would actually be active against cancer and HIV [ ... ] At the present time , there are a lot of therapeutic targets that have many people excited . 
 An ABC news story which reported on this went on to suggest " the excitement could vanish overnight if the federal government criminalized the sale or possession of salvia , as the Drug Enforcement Agency [ sic ] is considering doing right now . " A proposed Schedule I classification would mean ( among other things ) that there 's no " currently accepted medical use " as far as the United States government is concerned . Scientists worry that such legislation would restrict further work . Mendelsohn said scheduling salvia could scare away a great deal of research and development into salvia 's therapeutic promise . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 The relatively recent emergence of Salvia divinorum in modern Western culture , in comparison to its long continuing traditions of indigenous use , contrasts widely differing attitudes on the subject . 
 Opinions range from veneration of the plant as a spiritual sacrament or " a gift from the gods " , to ' threat to society ' , to be banned as quickly as possible in order to " spare countless families the horror of losing a loved one to the relentless tentacles of drug abuse " . 
 = = = Media coverage = = = 
 Interest in Salvia divinorum has been escalating in the news media , particularly in the United States , where an increasing number of newspaper reports have been published and television news stories broadcast . 
 These stories generally raise alarms over salvia 's legal status , for example comparing it to LSD , or describing it as " the new pot " , with parental concerns being raised by particular focus on salvia 's use by younger teens . 
 Story headlines may also include ' danger ' keywords , such as " Dangerous Herb is Legal ... " or " Deadly Dangers Of A Street Legal High " . 
 Mainstream news coverage and journalistic opinion has widely been negative on the subject . In a local news report aired on ABC affiliate WJLA in Washington , DC on July 11 , 2007 , the anchors are seen to exchange expressions of incredulity when referring to a salvia story with the following introduction " Now , an exclusive I @-@ Team investigation of a hallucinogenic drug that has begun to sweep the nation . What might amaze you is that right now the federal government is doing nothing to stop it " . 
 In March 2008 a Texas news report aired with the story " A legal drug that teenagers are now using to get high could soon be banned here in San Antonio - all because of a Fox News 4 investigation " , going on to say , " The drug is legal in Texas , at least for now . But a News 4 investigation could lead to a new ordinance to protect your kids . " 
 Many salvia media stories headline with comparisons to LSD . However , while LSD and salvinorin A may have comparative potencies , in the sense that both can produce their effects at low dosages , they are otherwise quite different . The two substances are not chemically similar or related , as salvinorin A is found naturally in a single plant while LSD is chemically <unk> from <unk> like ergotamine . They are ingested in different ways and produce different effects , which manifest themselves over different timescales . For example , the effects of salvia when smoked typically last for only a few minutes as compared to LSD , whose effects can persist for 8 – 12 hours . 
 = = = Brett 's law = = = 
 A particular focus of many US media stories is the long @-@ running coverage of the case of Brett Chidester , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Delaware student who committed suicide in January 2006 by carbon monoxide poisoning . 
 Reportedly , some months before this , Brett 's mother Kathleen Chidester had learned about his salvia use and questioned him about it . Brett said that he had ceased his experimentation , but his parents did not believe that he was telling the truth . They have instead argued that salvia @-@ induced depression was largely to blame for his death . Some of Brett 's earlier writings about his salvia experiences have been used to suggest that it made him think " existence in general is pointless . " Some media stories have referred to these earlier written experience reports as if they were part of Brett 's suicide note . In any case , a law was soon passed in Delaware classifying the herb as a Schedule I controlled substance in that state . This legislation was nicknamed Brett 's law ( formally referred to as Senate bill 259 ) . 
 Although the Chidester story has been given continued exposure by US media , there has not been anywhere else , either before or since this controversial incident , any other reported cases involving or alleging Salvia divinorum as a serious factor in suicide , overdose , accidental , or any other kind of death . Regarding this , San Francisco attorney Alex <unk> has commented , " It 's remarkable that Chidester 's parents , and only Chidester 's parents , continue to be cited over and over again by the mainstream media in their coverage of the supposed ' controversy ' over the risks of Salvia divinorum . " 
 Kathleen Chidester has continued campaigning for " Schedule I " -like legislation beyond their home state of Delaware . For example , three years after Brett 's death , in written testimony in support of Senator Richard Colburn 's proposed Senate Bill to the Maryland State Legislature , saying , " My hope and goal is to have salvia regulated across the US . It 's my son 's legacy and I will not end my fight until this happens . " 
 = = = Usage shown on YouTube = = = 
 A reported concern has been the emergence of YouTube videos showing alleged salvia users laughing uncontrollably , apparently unable to perform simple tasks or to communicate . In an interview with California @-@ based newspaper the San Francisco Chronicle , published in June 2007 , Daniel Siebert was quoted as saying : 
 " Those videos are certainly not going to help the situation . They make salvia look like some horrible drug that makes people nuts and dangerous [ ... ] " and " The sad thing is it creates this public image where people don 't realize there are sensible ways to use something like this . " 
 The New York Times has reported that " in state after state [ ... ] the YouTube videos have become Exhibit A in legislative efforts to regulate salvia . " 
 Waco Representative Charles Anderson ( R ) , who is sponsoring one of several bills to ban salvia in Texas saying , " When you see it , well , it sure makes a believer out of you . " Anderson told colleagues at a legislative hearing about a video that depicts a salvia user behind the wheel of a car . 
 " What we really worry about , " said Mr. Anderson at the hearing , " is youngsters doing this and then getting in a vehicle or getting on a motorcycle or jumping in a pool somewhere . " 
 Michigan Representative Michael Sak ( D ) submitted a bill which proposed Schedule I classification of Salvia divinorum and salvinorin A. He said that if people had questions about the deleterious effects of salvia , they should go on YouTube to watch the videos . A reporter questioned Sak as to whether he had ever seen a " Girls Gone Wild " video , and whether that would incite him to make alcohol illegal ( Sak replied that he hadn 't yet had a chance to review the material ) . 
 Nebraska Senator Vickie McDonald said : 
 " Anytime anything 's on YouTube it 's an issue , " and " Legislators , parents , grandparents , we need to be on top of these things , " [ ... ] " We need to protect our children ... " 
 Senator McDonald of Nebraska proposed Schedule I listing Salvia divinorum as part of their Controlled Substances Act , under which possession of salvia would have been considered a Class IV felony with a penalty of up to five years and trafficking would have fallen under a Class III felony with up to a 20 year penalty . 
 In Massachusetts , YouTube videos were shown by a retired police officer to public health and judiciary committees as evidence in favor of outlawing it there . 
 The issue has been raised of whether the salvia videos are in breach of YouTube 's own community guidelines , which ask users not to " cross the line " and post videos showing " bad stuff " like " drug abuse " . The question is considered as particularly problematical as the videos may be something of an enforcement grey area . 
 = = Legal status = = 
 At present Salvia divinorum remains legal in most countries . Countries where it is controlled in some manner include : Belgium , Canada , Denmark , Estonia , Italy , Japan , the United States , Russia , Spain , Sweden , Finland , and Romania . 
 The prohibitive degree of Salvia divinorum legislation varies widely from country to country . Australia has imposed its strictest ' schedule 9 ' ( US Schedule I equivalent ) , and Italy has also placed salvia in its ' Table I ' of controlled substances ( also US Schedule I equivalent ) . In Spain , there are controls focusing only on the commercial trade of Salvia divinorum , personal cultivation ( i.e. for non @-@ commercial use ) is not targeted . 
 Legislation may prove difficult to enforce . The plant has a nondescript appearance ; unlike many other drug plants , the leaves are non @-@ descript , and without a detectable odour . Salvia divinorum can be grown as an ordinary houseplant without the need of special equipment such as <unk> or high @-@ power lights .

 In the United Kingdom , following a local newspaper story in October 2005 , a parliamentary Early Day Motion was raised calling for Salvia divinorum to be banned there . However , it only received 11 signatures . A second motion raised in October 2008 attracted 18 signatures , and it was reported that Mann had also written to Jacqui Smith , then Home Secretary . The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , the independent body that advises UK government on drugs , was asked to investigate further .

 Salvia divinorum is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited plant in Australia under the Poisons Standard ( October 2015 ) .

" 
 = = = US legality = = = 
 National legislation for amendment of the Controlled Substances Act to place salvinorin A and Salvia divinorum in Schedule I at the federal level in the United States was proposed in 2002 by Representative Joe Baca ( D- California ) . Those opposed to bill HR <unk> include Daniel Siebert , who sent a letter to Congress arguing against the proposed legislation , and the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics ( <unk> ) , who sent key members of the US Congress a report on Salvia divinorum and its active principle , along with letters from an array of scientists who expressed concern that scheduling Salvia divinorum would negatively impact important research on the plant . The bill did not pass . 
 Although salvia is not regulated under the Controlled Substances Act , some American states , including Alabama , Delaware , Illinois , Louisiana , Michigan , Missouri , Ohio , Texas and others , have passed their own laws . Several other states have proposed legislation against salvia , including Alaska , California , Florida , Iowa , Maryland , New Jersey , New York , Oregon , and Pennsylvania . Many of these proposals have not made it into law , with motions having failed , stalled or otherwise died , for example at committee review stages .

 = = = Opinions and arguments = = = 
 Concerns expressed by some politicians on the subject of salvia reflect those of the media , with comparisons to LSD and particular focus on " protecting our children " being echoed ; and with legislative proposals following soon after news stories breaking . 
 Some arguments against salvia have been of a preventative nature , " We need to stop this before it gets to be a huge problem not after it gets to be a huge problem , " or of an imitative nature , " The Australians have clearly found a problem with it . There 's obviously a risk in people taking it . " Concerns about driving while under the influence of salvia have also been expressed . 
 Opponents of more prohibitive measures against salvia argue that such reactions are largely due to an inherent prejudice and a particular cultural bias rather than any actual balance of evidence , pointing out inconsistencies in attitudes toward other more toxic and addictive drugs such as alcohol and nicotine . While not objecting to some form of legal control , in particular with regard to the sale to minors or sale of enhanced high @-@ strength extracts , most salvia proponents otherwise argue against stricter legislation . 
 Those advocating consideration of Salvia divinorum 's potential for beneficial use in a modern context argue that more could be learned from Mazatec culture , where salvia is not really associated with notions of drug taking at all and it is rather considered as a spiritual sacrament . In light of this it is argued that Salvia divinorum could be better understood more positively as an entheogen rather than pejoratively as a hallucinogen . 
 = = = = Public opinion = = = = 
 Despite its growing notoriety in some circles , media stories generally suggest that the public at large are still mostly unaware of salvia , with the majority perhaps having never even heard of it . 
 Although published responses may not necessarily be representative of public opinion as a whole , some news agencies generally support reader and viewer feedback in connection with their stories .

 = New York State Route 251 = 
 New York State Route 251 ( NY 251 ) is an east – west state highway in western New York in the United States . It extends for 17 @.@ 79 miles ( 28 @.@ 63 km ) from NY 383 in Scottsville , Monroe County , to NY 96 in the town of Victor , Ontario County . NY 251 connects to Interstate 390 ( I @-@ 390 ) in Rush and serves the village of Honeoye Falls ( via NY 65 ) and the hamlet of Mendon within the town of the same name . The route , a two @-@ lane , rural highway for much of its length , also intersects NY 15 and NY 64 , two north – south highways leading to the Southern Tier and the Finger Lakes , respectively . Two sections of the route — from south of Scottsville to Rush and from Mendon to western Victor — follow linear east – west alignments . All but 3 miles ( 5 km ) of the route are located in Monroe County . 
 From 1911 to 1921 , the north – south section of modern NY 251 near Scottsville was part of Route 15 , an unsigned legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature . The first portion of what is now NY 251 to receive a posted designation was the segment east of NY 64 in Mendon , which was part of the signed NY 15 from 1924 to 1930 . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 251 was assigned to an alignment extending from Gates to Victor via Scottsville , utilizing modern NY 386 north of Scottsville and its current alignment east of the village . NY 251 was truncated to begin at NY 383 in Scottsville in the late 1970s , at which time the former routing of NY 251 between Scottsville and Gates became part of an extended NY 386 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 251 begins at an intersection with NY 383 in the center of the village of Scottsville , located within the town of Wheatland . It departs Scottsville to the south as River Road and crosses over Oatka Creek before meeting Quaker Road at a rural intersection just south of the village . While River Road continues southward as the unsigned NY <unk> , NY 251 turns east to begin its east – west trek across the mostly undeveloped southern portion of Monroe County . After roughly 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) , it crosses over the Genesee River and into the town of Rush , becoming Rush – Scottsville Road in the process . Just inside the town line , NY 251 passes through the hamlet of Industry , a location centered around NY 251 's grade crossing with the Livonia , Avon and Lakeville Railroad and the adjacent Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum . 
 Midway through the town of Rush , NY 251 widens from two to four lanes and meets I @-@ 390 at exit 11 . Just east of the freeway , NY 251 intersects NY 15 , which is also served by exit 11 by way of a pair of short collector / distributor roads paralleling I @-@ 390 from NY 251 to NY 15 . Past NY 15 , the route reverts to a two @-@ lane highway and veers southeast to parallel Honeoye Creek into the hamlet of Rush . Here , the route passes through a more populated area as it intersects NY 15A in the center of the community , at which point it becomes Rush – Mendon Road . NY 251 continues to follow Honeoye Creek through progressively less developed areas and into the town of Mendon , where the creek curves southward toward Honeoye Falls at Rochester Junction . The highway , however , turns northeastward to meet NY 65 at a roundabout . The northeasterly routing of NY 251 continues to Mendon Center , a small hamlet near the southern tip of Mendon Ponds Park , where it turns eastward once more . 
 NY 251 continues across open fields to the densely populated hamlet of Mendon , where it has a junction with NY 64 in the center of the community . East of the junction , NY 251 becomes Victor – Mendon Road as it heads out of Mendon . About 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) from NY 64 , the open surroundings return as the route crosses into the Ontario County town of Victor . NY 251 continues on a virtual east – west line for its first 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) in the county , heading through slightly more developed but still sparsely populated areas . At Phillips Road , the route curves southeastward for 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) before making one final turn to the northeast . On this last stretch , NY 251 crosses the Ontario Central Railroad at a grade crossing and ends at a junction with NY 96 northwest of the village of Victor .

 The westernmost portion of what is now NY 251 between NY 383 in Scottsville and the junction of River and Quaker Roads south of the village was once part of Route 15 , an unsigned legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature . Route 15 was extended northward from its original terminus in Caledonia to Scottsville via River Road on July 24 , 1911 ; however , it was realigned on March 1 , 1921 , to enter Scottsville on modern NY 383 instead . When the first set of posted routes were assigned in New York in 1924 , this piece of modern NY 251 did not receive a designation . Another section did , however , as the portion extending from Mendon east to Victor was designated as part of NY 15 . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 15 was rerouted between Victor and Pittsford to follow current NY 96 . The former routing of NY 15 from Victor to Mendon became part of NY 251 , a new highway extending from NY 15 in Victor to NY 33 in Gates via Chili and Scottsville . West of Scottsville , NY 251 was routed on modern NY 383 and NY 386 . 
 From 1930 to c . 1938 , the River Road section of NY 251 overlapped with NY 35 , which initially entered Monroe County on the former routing of legislative Route 15 and continued north to Rochester on current NY 383 . The southwestern end of NY 35 was moved to Mumford c . 1938 , shifting the location of the overlap to Main Street in Scottsville . The concurrency was replaced with one with NY 383 when it supplanted most of NY 35 in the early 1940s . In the late 1970s , NY 251 was truncated to begin at the eastern end of its overlap with NY 383 in Scottsville . The former routing of NY 251 from the west end of the concurrency in Scottsville to Gates became an extension of NY 386 , which was a simple connector in northern Gates and southern Greece prior to the change .

 = Tropical Storm Lester ( 2004 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Lester was a weak tropical storm that paralleled the Mexican coastline in October 2004 . The 16th tropical cyclone and 12th named storm of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season , Lester originated from an area of disturbed weather that persisted southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec . After organizing , the system was designated as a tropical depression on October 11 . The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm the next day , and moved northwestward , just off the Mexican coastline . Due to the interaction with land among other factors , the storm degenerated on October 13 . The storm dropped locally heavy rainfall , which caused minor flooding and mudslides . No fatalities or significant damage were reported .

 By October 10 , 2004 , an area of disturbed weather was situated well to the southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec . Later that day , a surface low pressure system developed , and convection began to organize into slightly curved bands . The disturbance continued to in this manner , and at 1800 UTC on October 11 , the low level circulation had become sufficiently organized to be designated as a tropical depression . At the time , the depression consisted of a well @-@ defined circulation , with some deep thunderstorm activity . Despite weak steering currents , the system started what was initially thought to be a westward drift , though just a few hours later was found to be towards the northwest . A small cyclone , a burst of deep convection formed at around the same time , and was said could have produced tropical storm @-@ force winds . 
 Continuing its slow , northwestward track under the weal steering currents of a weak mid @-@ level ridge to its north , and a broad cyclonic circulation to its southwest , it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lester at 1800 UTC on October 12 . Originally , it was unclear whether the center of circulation would remain slightly offshore , or move inland . Due to the presence of a weak upper @-@ level anticyclone that was centered just east of the system , favorable atmospheric conditions for strengthening prevailed , and the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) about 6 – 12 hours after being upgraded to a tropical storm . Early on October 13 , radar imagery from Acapulco , Mexico indicated that Lester remained a small and well @-@ organized cyclone as it passed just offshore . At the same time , light southwesterly wind shear began to develop . The interaction with land , combined with influence from the low to the southwest , started to weaken the storm , and it was downgraded to a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on October 13 . By later that day , reports from an Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter Aircraft indicated that the cyclone had degenerated into a trough on the northeastern side of the larger low to the southwest .

 On October 12 , in response to Lester , the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for the coast between Punta Maldonado to Zihuatanejo . It was upgraded to a warning later that day . It was extended to Lázaro Cárdenas on October 13 . Later that day , the warning was lifted when Lester dissipated . Lester brought rains to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero , reaching 3 to 5 inches ( 76 to 127 mm ) . The highest 24 @-@ hour total peaked at 106 @.@ 5 mm ( 4 @.@ 19 in ) , recorded on October 12 . Localized flooding was likely caused by the storm , though no reports of deaths were received by the National Hurricane Center . However , the storm capsized two ships , and washed two more ashore . The heavy rain caused mudslides , which buried one man in his home ; he was later rescued by his family . In and around the port of Acapulco , about 14 trees were downed , and minor pooling of water was reported .

 Tvrđa ( Citadel ) is the Old Town of the city of Osijek in Croatia . It is the best @-@ preserved and largest ensemble of Baroque buildings in Croatia and consists of a Habsburg star fort built on the right bank of the River Drava . Tvrđa has been described by the World Monuments Fund as " a unique example of an eighteenth @-@ century baroque military , administrative , and commercial urban center " . 
 The star fort was constructed in the immediate vicinity of medieval Osijek after the defeat of the Ottoman forces in 1687 , due to Osijek 's strategic importance . Constructed starting in 1712 to plans by Mathias von Kaiserfeld and then Maximilian Gosseau de Henef , all five planned bastions and two gates were complete by 1715 . By 1735 , the inner town was finished and three northern bastions had been added . When complete , it was the largest and most advanced Habsburg fortress on the border with the Ottoman Empire , consisting of eight bastions and featuring armories , depots , a garrison headquarters , military court , construction office , a garrison physician , guardhouse , officers ' apartments , a military hospital and seven barracks . The completed fort was entirely surrounded with walls and palisades and had four main gates at each side ( north , south , east , west ) . Tvrđa had street lights by 1717 and was the site of the first public water supply in Croatia , opened in 1751 . 
 Tvrđa 's military importance decreased after the Berlin Congress of 1878 , with the increasing stability of the surrounding region . Most of the fort walls and fortifications were destroyed in the 1920s due to the obstacle they presented to the development of Osijek . While the fortifications have largely been removed , the fort 's interior core remains intact and is now home to churches , museums , schools and other public buildings , as well as numerous bars and restaurants . Of the fortification system , only the northern side of the walls now remain intact , as well as parts of the first and eighth bastions along with the northern gate known as the ' water gate ' ( ' <unk> vrata ' ) . Tvrđa sustained significant damage during the Croatian War of Independence during the 1990s and was featured on the 1996 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites . It now features on Croatia 's ' tentative list ' for consideration as a nominee for a World Heritage Site .

 The new name of Osijek first appeared in 1196 . The center of medieval Osijek was on the banks of the River Drava where Tvrđa now stands . The town was a trade and port settlement from the early 12th century due to its position on the way from Pécs and Buda southwards . The site was home to the Romanesque church of the Holy Trinity . Between 1526 and 1687 Osijek was ruled by the Ottomans , who did not change the layout of the settlement in any substantial way but introduced Islamic places of worship , giving the area an Oriental appearance . Traces of medieval and Ottoman towns remain to this day , including a remnant of the old Ottoman fortress wall , known today as the " Turkish Wall " ( Turski <unk> ) or " <unk> 's Fort " ( <unk> <unk> ) , lying next to the Tvrđa access road . 
 During the Ottoman period , Osijek was internationally known because of the Suleiman Bridge . The construction of the bridge was begun by İbrahim Pasha on 16 August 1526 following the orders of Suleiman the Magnificent . The bridge , which connected Osijek and Darda , took the form of a wooden road on piers and was approximately 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) long and 6 metres ( 20 ft ) wide . Seen as a great threat to Christian Europe the bridge was attacked several times , being destroyed in 1664 , when it was set on fire on the orders of Croatian feudal lord Nicholas VII of Zrin ( Croatian : Nikola VII . Zrinski , Hungarian : VII . Zrínyi Miklós ) . The bridge was rebuilt during the rule of Suleiman II . Finally , it was burned down by the Habsburg armies in 1686 .

 Development of the military settlement at Tvrđa started in 1687 when the Habsburg armies drove the Ottomans out of the city during the Great Turkish War . The chief commander of the Imperial army , Louis William , Margrave of Baden @-@ Baden , saw Osijek as a location of exceptional strategic importance in the war against the Ottomans . He urged the repair of the city walls , and proposed construction of a new fort according to Vauban 's principles of military engineering . 
 The town magistrate was established in 1690 , while the plans for the new fort were still being drawn up , and one of its documents from August of the same year described the condition of the settlement as " ruinous " . Two months later , on 29 October , the Ottoman army suddenly attacked . The attack was repulsed only thanks to a well @-@ organised defense , and the Turks withdrew on 6 November , after a brief siege . The event was a clear lesson that the construction of the fort must not be delayed any further . The first phase of Tvrđa 's conversion into a Baroque fortress was based on the plan devised by the engineer Mathias von Kaiserfeld from 1691 . 
 = = = = Second layout in 18th century = = = = 
 The original plan for Tvrđa was drafted because of the need to reinforce the town walls , but did not include provisions to redesign the interior and envisaged largely uncontrolled development . New plans for a fort on the right bank of the River Drava were drawn up by Maximilian Gosseau de Henef . Gosseau took over planning of the fort when construction was already under way . Starting in August 1712 , Austrian engineers , supervised by the fort 's commander , General Johann Stephan von <unk> , built barracks , staff headquarters , churches and monasteries , surrounded by system of moats , bastions and gun positions , respecting Gosseau 's design . The design followed the model of lowland Dutch military fortifications of the period . 
 By 1715 , all five planned bastions and two gates were complete . An additional , western , gate leading to the Upper Town was added in 1716 . The construction of the outwork on the opposite bank of the River Drava , designed to offer protection from the north and to serve as a bridgehead , was completed by 1721 . The final , fourth gate , leading to the Lower Town , was not added until 1783 . Construction of the inner town was completed by 1733 , and in 1735 three additional northern bastions were completed , along with a post office , the fort 's construction office and a hospital . The completed fort had " eight bastions , two armories , two major depots , garrison headquarters , military court , construction office , garrison physician , guardhouse , officer apartments , military hospital and seven barracks " . Based on the ' ring model ' , the fortifications took up an area of 80 hectares ( 200 acres ) , making Tvrđa the largest fortress on the border with the Ottoman Empire . 
 Gosseau 's plan left space for churches to be built where mosques had once stood . Initially , converted mosques were used as churches , but Franciscans started to build a Baroque church in 1709 and it was consecrated in 1732 . A Franciscan monastery was built between 1699 and 1705 , with a new wing being added between 1731 and 1733 , which subsequently became a new monastery in 1761 . In 1725 , the Jesuits commenced construction of the parish church of St. Michael ( Croatian : Sveti <unk> ) , following the construction of their own monastery . This church was in use after 1734 , despite being incomplete . A Holy Trinity column was erected in the fort 's main square in 1730 as a plague monument featuring volutes with pedestals on which four protectors against the plague are placed . Four additional pedestals were added to the monument in 1784 , each featuring a statue of a saint . Tvrđa had street lighting as early as 1717 . The first system to supply public water in Croatia was opened in Tvrđa in 1751 . 
 In the mid @-@ 18th century there were reportedly more than 35 inns in Tvrđa , estimated to an account for one in three of the fort 's buildings . Crown prince Joseph stayed in one of the inns when visiting Osijek . In 1786 , as Joseph II , he decreed the merger of the Upper Town , Lower Town and Tvrđa into one single town council . 
 = = = 19th and 20th century = = = 
 As early as the second half of the 18th century there was little or no new constructions taking place in Tvrđa , and even maintenance of the fort became a burden . In 1809 Osijek was granted free royal town status . Osijek 's council was accommodated in a building at the south @-@ eastern corner of Tvrđa 's main square . 
 Tvrđa 's military importance decreased after the Berlin Congress of 1878 as a result of increasing political and military stability in the region . Two north @-@ western bastions were demolished in the 1870s , making way for Ambrose 's Park ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> ) . Construction of the Royal Grammar School started in 1881 , and the Royal General Secondary School was completed in 1890 . Episcopal seminary was also built in the south @-@ western corner of the main square in 1898 . These were the only buildings erected within Tvrđa walls in the last three decades of the 19th century . 
 As Osijek grew as a city , the fort 's presence hindered the potential for urban development . The demolition of most of the fort walls happened between 1923 and 1926 , with the construction of an electric tramway . The last gunpowder magazine , located behind the church of St. Michael , was demolished in 1958 . While most of the fortifications have been demolished ( only the first and eighth bastions and the northern wall with its so @-@ called ' water gate ' were kept ) , the center of Tvrđa remains intact . The Yugoslav People 's Army maintained a garrison and a military hospital in Tvrđa , but in the 1980s these buildings were gradually being abandoned , and adapted into ateliers for local painters and sculptors . 
 The fort sustained considerable damage during the Croatian War of Independence , which lasted from 1991 until 1995 . The war brought structural damage from collapsing roofs , walls and floors . These damages threaten plaster , sculpture and murals that lack proper protection and are subject to continuing decay . 
 = = Present day = = 
 After the fortress 's military importance decreased at the end of the 19th century , Tvrđa became a center of administrative , educational , cultural , and scholarly life in Osijek and the entire region . The first school in Osijek was organized at Tvrđa ; the first scholarly curriculum was introduced in 1707 , to be later expanded and renewed , and the first printing press started working in 1735 . The significance of educational institutions of Tvrđa are best underlined by the fact that Croatian Nobel Prize laureates , <unk> <unk> and Vladimir Prelog , along with Serbian scientist Milutin <unk> ( Milankovitch cycles ) , were all alumni ( graduates ) of the Tvrđa schools . The Faculty of Agriculture of the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek has occupied the former general headquarters since 1995 after its previous site was destroyed in the Croatian War of Independence . The Faculty of Food Technology has been relocated to a building that served as the first military hospital in Osijek , from the mid @-@ 17th century until the beginning of the 1990s . Other present @-@ day educational institutions in Tvrđa include the II and the III Gymnasium , Franjo <unk> Music School ( former Roman Catholic Seminary ) , Jesuit Classical Gymnasium ( former logistics barracks built in the mid @-@ 18th century ) , and the Secondary School of Economics ( former grammar school for girls ) . 
 According to the 2001 census , within the Tvrđa city district , there are 10 @,@ 277 inhabitants living in 3 @,@ 310 households . The fort interior is now a centre of Osijek 's nightlife . There are numerous bars and restaurants in Tvrđa . The fort hosts the Museum of Slavonia , the largest general @-@ type museum in Croatia , located in Tvrđa since 1946 . The former town museum and archives building today houses the State Directorate for Monument Protection , a department of the Croatian Ministry of Culture . The patron saint of the Tvrđa is Saint Michael , and his feast day of September 29 is celebrated as the day of the Tvrđa city district .

 The World Monuments Fund has described Tvrđa as " a unique example of an eighteenth @-@ century baroque military , administrative , and commercial urban center " . Tvrđa is on Croatia 's ' Tentative List ' for consideration as nominee for the World Heritage Site . During the 1991 – 95 conflict in Croatia , 90 per cent of the buildings in Tvrđa were damaged to some extent and the fort was featured on the 1996 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites . It has not appeared on the list , published every two years , since . 
 The building of the general headquarters , dating from 1726 , and the ground plan of the fortress are depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 200 kuna banknote , issued in 1993 and 2002 . 
 The Agency for Restoration of Osijek Tvrđa ( Croatian : <unk> za <unk> <unk> <unk> ) was established in 1999 . Its stated goals are protection , restoration and revitalization of Tvrđa . The restoration process aims to preserve architectural , historical and aesthetic qualities of Tvrđa in full accordance with the restoration principles set by the International Council on Monuments and Sites , while maintaining its multifunctional character . International cooperation is also envisioned , in particular with the Council of Europe . The Agency is jointly funded by the Government of Croatia , Osijek @-@ Baranja County and the City of Osijek .
