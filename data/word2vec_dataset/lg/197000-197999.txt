 <formula> 
 This limit holds in the sense of mean convergence ( convergence in L1 ) . Further conditions on the ηε , for instance that it be a mollifier associated to a compactly supported function , are needed to ensure pointwise convergence almost everywhere . 
 If the initial η = 
 η1 is itself smooth and compactly supported then the sequence is called a mollifier . The standard mollifier is obtained by choosing η to be a suitably normalized bump function , for instance 
 <formula> 
 In some situations such as numerical analysis , a piecewise linear approximation to the identity is desirable . This can be obtained by taking η1 to be a hat function . With this choice of η1 , one has 
 <formula> 
 which are all continuous and compactly supported , although not smooth and so not a mollifier . 
 = = = Probabilistic considerations = = = 
 In the context of probability theory , it is natural to impose the additional condition that the initial η1 in an approximation to the identity should be positive , as such a function then represents a probability distribution . Convolution with a probability distribution is sometimes favorable because it does not result in overshoot or <unk> , as the output is a convex combination of the input values , and thus falls between the maximum and minimum of the input function . Taking η1 to be any probability distribution at all , and letting ηε ( x ) = η1 ( x / ε ) / ε as above will give rise to an approximation to the identity . In general this converges more rapidly to a delta function if , in addition , η has mean 0 and has small higher moments . For instance , if η1 is the uniform distribution on [ − 1 / 2 , 1 / 2 ] , also known as the rectangular function , then : 
 <formula> 
 Another example is with the Wigner semicircle distribution 
 <formula> 
 This is continuous and compactly supported , but not a mollifier because it is not smooth . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Nascent delta functions often arise as convolution semigroups . This amounts to the further constraint that the convolution of ηε with <unk> must satisfy 
 <formula> 
 for all ε , δ > 0 . Convolution semigroups in L1 that form a nascent delta function are always an approximation to the identity in the above sense , however the semigroup condition is quite a strong restriction . 
 In practice , semigroups approximating the delta function arise as fundamental solutions or Green 's functions to physically motivated elliptic or parabolic partial differential equations . In the context of applied mathematics , semigroups arise as the output of a linear time @-@ invariant system . <unk> , if A is a linear operator acting on functions of x , then a convolution semigroup arises by solving the initial value problem 
 <formula> 
 in which the limit is as usual understood in the weak sense . Setting ηε ( x ) 
 = η ( ε , x ) gives the associated nascent delta function . 
 Some examples of physically important convolution semigroups arising from such a fundamental solution include the following . 
 The heat kernel 
 The heat kernel , defined by 
 <formula> 
 represents the temperature in an infinite wire at time t > 0 , if a unit of heat energy is stored at the origin of the wire at time t = 
 0 . This semigroup evolves according to the one @-@ dimensional heat equation : 
 <formula> 
 In probability theory , ηε ( x ) is a normal distribution of variance ε and mean 0 . It represents the probability density at time t = ε of the position of a particle starting at the origin following a standard Brownian motion . In this context , the semigroup condition is then an expression of the Markov property of Brownian motion . 
 In higher @-@ dimensional Euclidean space Rn , the heat kernel is 
 <formula> 
 and has the same physical interpretation , mutatis mutandis . It also represents a nascent delta function in the sense that ηε → δ in the distribution sense as ε → 0 . 
 The Poisson kernel 
 The Poisson kernel 
 <formula> 
 is the fundamental solution of the Laplace equation in the upper half @-@ plane . It represents the electrostatic potential in a semi @-@ infinite plate whose potential along the edge is held at fixed at the delta function . The Poisson kernel is also closely related to the Cauchy distribution . This semigroup evolves according to the equation 
 <formula> 
 where the operator is rigorously defined as the Fourier multiplier 
 <formula> 
 = = = <unk> integrals = = = 
 In areas of physics such as wave propagation and wave mechanics , the equations involved are hyperbolic and so may have more singular solutions . As a result , the nascent delta functions that arise as fundamental solutions of the associated Cauchy problems are generally oscillatory integrals . An example , which comes from a solution of the Euler – <unk> equation of transonic gas dynamics , is the <unk> Airy function 
 <formula> 
 Although using the Fourier transform , it is easy to see that this generates a semigroup in some sense , it is not absolutely integrable and so cannot define a semigroup in the above strong sense . Many nascent delta functions constructed as oscillatory integrals only converge in the sense of distributions ( an example is the Dirichlet kernel below ) , rather than in the sense of measures . 
 Another example is the Cauchy problem for the wave equation in R1 + 1 : 
 <formula> 
 The solution u represents the displacement from equilibrium of an infinite elastic string , with an initial disturbance at the origin . 
 Other approximations to the identity of this kind include the <unk> function ( used widely in electronics and telecommunications ) 
 <formula> 
 and the Bessel function 
 <formula> 
 = = = Plane wave decomposition = = = 
 One approach to the study of a linear partial differential equation 
 <formula> 
 where L is a differential operator on Rn , is to seek first a fundamental solution , which is a solution of the equation 
 <formula> 
 When L is particularly simple , this problem can often be resolved using the Fourier transform directly ( as in the case of the Poisson kernel and heat kernel already mentioned ) . For more complicated operators , it is sometimes easier first to consider an equation of the form 
 <formula> 
 where h is a plane wave function , meaning that it has the form 
 <formula> 
 for some vector ξ . Such an equation can be resolved ( if the coefficients of L are analytic functions ) by the Cauchy – <unk> theorem or ( if the coefficients of L are constant ) by quadrature . So , if the delta function can be decomposed into plane waves , then one can in principle solve linear partial differential equations . 
 Such a decomposition of the delta function into plane waves was part of a general technique first introduced essentially by Johann Radon , and then developed in this form by Fritz John ( 1955 ) . Choose k so that n + k is an even integer , and for a real number s , put 
 <formula> 
 Then δ is obtained by applying a power of the Laplacian to the integral with respect to the unit sphere measure <unk> of g ( x · ξ ) for ξ in the unit sphere Sn − 1 : 
 <formula> 
 The Laplacian here is interpreted as a weak derivative , so that this equation is taken to mean that , for any test function φ , 
 <formula> 
 The result follows from the formula for the Newtonian potential ( the fundamental solution of Poisson 's equation ) . This is essentially a form of the inversion formula for the Radon transform , because it recovers the value of φ ( x ) from its integrals over <unk> . For instance , if n is odd and k = 1 , then the integral on the right hand side is 
 <formula> 
 where <unk> ( ξ , p ) is the Radon transform of φ : 
 <formula> 
 An alternative equivalent expression of the plane wave decomposition , from Gel <unk> & <unk> ( 1966 – 1968 , I , § 3 @.@ 10 ) , is 
 <formula> 
 for n even , and 
 <formula> 
 for n odd . 
 = = = Fourier kernels = = = 
 In the study of Fourier series , a major question consists of determining whether and in what sense the Fourier series associated with a periodic function converges to the function . The nth partial sum of the Fourier series of a function f of period 2π is defined by convolution ( on the interval [ − π , π ] ) with the Dirichlet kernel : 
 <formula> 
 Thus , 
 <formula> 
 where 
 <formula> 
 A fundamental result of elementary Fourier series states that the Dirichlet kernel tends to the a multiple of the delta function as N → ∞ . This is interpreted in the distribution sense , that 
 <formula> 
 for every compactly supported smooth function f . Thus , formally one has 
 <formula> 
 on the interval [ − π , π ] . 
 In spite of this , the result does not hold for all compactly supported continuous functions : that is DN does not converge weakly in the sense of measures . The lack of convergence of the Fourier series has led to the introduction of a variety of summability methods in order to produce convergence . The method of Cesàro summation leads to the <unk> kernel 
 <formula> 
 The <unk> kernels tend to the delta function in a stronger sense that 
 <formula> 
 for every compactly supported continuous function f . The implication is that the Fourier series of any continuous function is Cesàro summable to the value of the function at every point . 
 = = = Hilbert space theory = = = 
 The Dirac delta distribution is a densely defined unbounded linear functional on the Hilbert space L2 of square integrable functions . Indeed , smooth compactly support functions are dense in L2 , and the action of the delta distribution on such functions is well @-@ defined . In many applications , it is possible to identify subspaces of L2 and to give a stronger topology on which the delta function defines a bounded linear functional . 
 Sobolev spaces 
 The Sobolev embedding theorem for Sobolev spaces on the real line R implies that any square @-@ integrable function f such that 
 <formula> 
 is automatically continuous , and satisfies in particular 
 <formula> 
 Thus δ is a bounded linear functional on the Sobolev space H1 . Equivalently δ is an element of the continuous dual space H − 1 of H1 . More generally , in n dimensions , one has δ ∈ H − s ( Rn ) provided s > n / 2 . 
 = = = = Spaces of holomorphic functions = = = = 
 In complex analysis , the delta function enters via Cauchy 's integral formula which asserts that if D is a domain in the complex plane with smooth boundary , then 
 <formula> 
 for all holomorphic functions f in D that are continuous on the closure of D. As a result , the delta function δz is represented on this class of holomorphic functions by the Cauchy integral : 
 <formula> 
 More generally , let H2 ( ∂ D ) be the Hardy space consisting of the closure in L2 ( ∂ D ) of all holomorphic functions in D continuous up to the boundary of D. Then functions in H2 ( ∂ D ) uniquely extend to holomorphic functions in D , and the Cauchy integral formula continues to hold . In particular for z ∈ D , the delta function δz is a continuous linear functional on H2 ( ∂ D ) . This is a special case of the situation in several complex variables in which , for smooth domains D , the Szegő kernel plays the role of the Cauchy integral . 
 = = = = Resolutions of the identity = = = = 
 Given a complete orthonormal basis set of functions { φn } in a separable Hilbert space , for example , the normalized eigenvectors of a compact self @-@ adjoint operator , any vector f can be expressed as : 
 <formula> 
 The coefficients { <unk> } are found as : 
 <formula> 
 which may be represented by the notation : 
 <formula> 
 a form of the bra – ket notation of Dirac . Adopting this notation , the expansion of f takes the dyadic form : 
 <formula> 
 Letting I denote the identity operator on the Hilbert space , the expression 
 <formula> 
 is called a resolution of the identity . When the Hilbert space is the space L2 ( D ) of square @-@ integrable functions on a domain D , the quantity : 
 <formula> 
 is an integral operator , and the expression for f can be rewritten as : 
 <formula> 
 The right @-@ hand side converges to f in the L2 sense . It need not hold in a pointwise sense , even when f is a continuous function . Nevertheless , it is common to abuse notation and write 
 <formula> 
 resulting in the representation of the delta function : 
 <formula> 
 With a suitable rigged Hilbert space ( Φ , L2 ( D ) , Φ * ) where Φ ⊂ L2 ( D ) contains all compactly supported smooth functions , this summation may converge in Φ * , depending on the properties of the basis φn . In most cases of practical interest , the orthonormal basis comes from an integral or differential operator , in which case the series converges in the distribution sense . 
 = = = <unk> delta functions = = = 
 Cauchy used an infinitesimal α to write down a unit impulse , infinitely tall and narrow Dirac @-@ type delta function <unk> satisfying <formula> in a number of articles in 1827 . Cauchy defined an infinitesimal in Cours d <unk> ( 1827 ) in terms of a sequence tending to zero . Namely , such a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in Cauchy 's and Lazare Carnot 's terminology . 
 Non @-@ standard analysis allows one to rigorously treat infinitesimals . The article by Yamashita ( 2007 ) contains a bibliography on modern Dirac delta functions in the context of an infinitesimal @-@ enriched continuum provided by the hyperreals . Here the Dirac delta can be given by an actual function , having the property that for every real function F one has <formula> as anticipated by Fourier and Cauchy . 
 = = Dirac comb = = 
 A so @-@ called uniform " pulse train " of Dirac delta measures , which is known as a Dirac comb , or as the Shah distribution , creates a sampling function , often used in digital signal processing ( DSP ) and discrete time signal analysis . The Dirac comb is given as the infinite sum , whose limit is understood in the distribution sense , 
 <formula> 
 which is a sequence of point masses at each of the integers . 
 Up to an overall normalizing constant , the Dirac comb is equal to its own Fourier transform . This is significant because if f is any Schwartz function , then the periodization of f is given by the convolution 
 <formula> 
 In particular , 
 <formula> 
 is precisely the Poisson summation formula .

 The <unk> – <unk> theorem , important in quantum mechanics , relates the delta function to the distribution <unk> / x , the Cauchy principal value of the function 1 / x , defined by

 for all integers i , j . This function then satisfies the following analog of the sifting property : if <formula> is any doubly infinite sequence , then 
 <formula> 
 Similarly , for any real or complex valued continuous function f on R , the Dirac delta satisfies the sifting property 
 <formula> 
 This exhibits the Kronecker delta function as a discrete analog of the Dirac delta function .

 = = = Probability theory = = = 
 In probability theory and statistics , the Dirac delta function is often used to represent a discrete distribution , or a partially discrete , partially continuous distribution , using a probability density function ( which is normally used to represent fully continuous distributions ) . For example , the probability density function f ( x ) of a discrete distribution consisting of points x = { x1 , ... , xn } , with corresponding probabilities p1 , ... , pn , can be written as 
 <formula> 
 As another example , consider a distribution which 6 / 10 of the time returns a standard normal distribution , and 4 / 10 of the time returns exactly the value 3 @.@ 5 ( i.e. a partly continuous , partly discrete mixture distribution ) . The density function of this distribution can be written as 
 <formula> 
 The delta function is also used in a completely different way to represent the local time of a diffusion process ( like Brownian motion ) . The local time of a stochastic process B ( t ) is given by 
 <formula> 
 and represents the amount of time that the process spends at the point x in the range of the process . More precisely , in one dimension this integral can be written 
 <formula> 
 where 1 [ x − ε , x + ε ] is the indicator function of the interval [ x − ε , x + ε ] . 
 = = = Quantum mechanics = = = 
 We give an example of how the delta function is expedient in quantum mechanics . The wave function of a particle gives the probability amplitude of finding a particle within a given region of space . Wave functions are assumed to be elements of the Hilbert space L2 of square @-@ integrable functions , and the total probability of finding a particle within a given interval is the integral of the magnitude of the wave function squared over the interval . A set { φn } of wave functions is orthonormal if they are normalized by 
 <formula> 
 where δ here refers to the Kronecker delta . A set of orthonormal wave functions is complete in the space of square @-@ integrable functions if any wave function ψ can be expressed as a combination of the φn : 
 <formula> 
 with <formula> . Complete orthonormal systems of wave functions appear naturally as the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian ( of a bound system ) in quantum mechanics that measures the energy levels , which are called the eigenvalues . The set of eigenvalues , in this case , is known as the spectrum of the Hamiltonian . In bra – ket notation , as above , this equality implies the resolution of the identity : 
 <formula> 
 Here the eigenvalues are assumed to be discrete , but the set of eigenvalues of an observable may be continuous rather than discrete . An example is the position observable , <unk> ( x ) = <unk> ( x ) . The spectrum of the position ( in one dimension ) is the entire real line , and is called a continuous spectrum . However , unlike the Hamiltonian , the position operator lacks proper eigenfunctions . The conventional way to overcome this shortcoming is to widen the class of available functions by allowing distributions as well : that is , to replace the Hilbert space of quantum mechanics by an appropriate rigged Hilbert space . In this context , the position operator has a complete set of eigen @-@ distributions , labeled by the points y of the real line , given by 
 <formula> 
 The eigenfunctions of position are denoted by <formula> in Dirac notation , and are known as position eigenstates . 
 Similar considerations apply to the eigenstates of the momentum operator , or indeed any other self @-@ adjoint unbounded operator P on the Hilbert space , provided the spectrum of P is continuous and there are no degenerate eigenvalues . In that case , there is a set Ω of real numbers ( the spectrum ) , and a collection <unk> of distributions indexed by the elements of Ω , such that 
 <formula> 
 That is , <unk> are the eigenvectors of P. If the eigenvectors are normalized so that 
 <formula> 
 in the distribution sense , then for any test function ψ , 
 <formula> 
 where 
 <formula> 
 That is , as in the discrete case , there is a resolution of the identity 
 <formula> 
 where the operator @-@ valued integral is again understood in the weak sense . If the spectrum of P has both continuous and discrete parts , then the resolution of the identity involves a summation over the discrete spectrum and an integral over the continuous spectrum . 
 The delta function also has many more specialized applications in quantum mechanics , such as the delta potential models for a single and double potential well . 
 = = = Structural mechanics = = = 
 The delta function can be used in structural mechanics to describe transient loads or point loads acting on structures . The governing equation of a simple mass – spring system excited by a sudden force impulse I at time t 
 = 0 can be written 
 <formula> 
 where m is the mass , ξ the deflection and k the spring constant . 
 As another example , the equation governing the static deflection of a slender beam is , according to Euler – Bernoulli theory , 
 <formula> 
 where EI is the bending stiffness of the beam , w the deflection , x the spatial coordinate and q ( x ) the load distribution . If a beam is loaded by a point force F at x = 
 x0 , the load distribution is written 
 <formula> 
 As integration of the delta function results in the Heaviside step function , it follows that the static deflection of a slender beam subject to multiple point loads is described by a set of piecewise polynomials . 
 Also a point moment acting on a beam can be described by delta functions . Consider two opposing point forces F at a distance d apart . They then produce a moment M 
 = <unk> acting on the beam . Now , let the distance d approach the limit zero , while M is kept constant . The load distribution , assuming a clockwise moment acting at x = 
 0 , is written 
 <formula> 
 Point moments can thus be represented by the derivative of the delta function . Integration of the beam equation again results in piecewise polynomial deflection .

 = Becoming Jane = 
 Becoming Jane is a 2007 British @-@ Irish biographical romantic drama film directed by Julian Jarrold . It depicts the early life of the English author Jane Austen and her lasting love for Thomas Langlois Lefroy . American actress Anne Hathaway stars as the title character , while her romantic interest is played by Scottish actor James McAvoy . Also appearing in the film are Julie Walters , James Cromwell and Maggie Smith . The film was produced in cooperation with several companies , including Ecosse Films and Blueprint Pictures . It also received funding from the Irish Film Board and the UK Film Council Premiere Fund . 
 The film is partly based on the 2003 book Becoming Jane Austen by Jon Hunter Spence , who was also hired as historical consultant . The final screenplay , developed by Sarah Williams and Kevin Hood , pieced together some known facts about Austen into a coherent story , in what co @-@ producer Graham Broadbent called " our own Austenesque landscape . " According to Hood , he attempted to weave together " what we know about Austen 's world from her books and letters , " and believed Austen 's personal life was the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice . Jarrold began production of the film in early 2006 , opting to shoot primarily in Ireland as he found it had better @-@ preserved locations than Hampshire , England , where Austen was raised . 
 Released firstly in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2007 and in other countries later in the year , Becoming Jane earned approximately $ 37 million worldwide . The film received mixed reviews from critics . Hathaway 's performance received mixed critical reception , with some reviewers negatively focusing on her nationality and accent . Commentators and scholars have analysed the presence of Austen characters and themes within the film , and also noted the implementation of mass marketing in the film 's release . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Jane Austen is the younger daughter of Reverend George Austen and his wife and has yet to find a suitable husband . She aspires to be a writer , to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father . 
 Thomas Lefroy is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation , which he describes as " typical " for people in the profession . Tom makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane , when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company . Overhearing his subsequent criticism , Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman . Meanwhile , she turns down the affections of other men , including Mr. Wisley , the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham . Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection . The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again ; they argue but increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane 's literary aspirations seriously . In time they fall in love . 
 Tom , Jane , her brother Henry and Jane 's rich widowed cousin , Eliza , Comtesse de <unk> , conspire to receive an invitation from Tom 's uncle and benefactor , the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London , for the rich " Madame La Comtesse " and her friends . This visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane 's brother , Edward . This would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane before and give a blessing for their marriage . Full of hope , Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge 's place . In a flow of inspiration , she then begins the writing of First Impressions , the manuscript that will become Pride and Prejudice . 
 However , Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane 's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing , declaring that he would wish Tom to be the <unk> he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage . Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed , not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason ; his family depends on him financially . 
 Jane returns home and soon learns that Tom has become engaged to someone else at the arrangement of his family . Jane accepts the marriage proposal of Mr. Wisley , whom she had earlier declined . Later , Tom realises he cannot live without Jane , and returns , asking Jane to run away with him , for " what value will there be in life , if we are not together ? " Jane agrees , and they leave , with only Jane 's sister Cassandra knowing they plan to marry in secret . 
 On the way , Jane stumbles upon a letter from Tom 's mother , and realises his situation : he sends money he receives from his uncle back to his parents and siblings , and his family cannot survive without it . She tells Tom that they cannot elope , not with so many people depending upon him . He insists that he and Jane must marry and tells her he will earn money , but Jane tells him that it will not be enough ; he will never be able to make enough money to support his dependents with a High Court judge ( his uncle ) as an enemy and with a penniless wife . Distraught , Tom asks her if she loves him , and she replies , " Yes , but if our love destroys your family , then it will destroy itself , in a long , slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame . " As she leaves , Jane catches a last glimpse of Tom through the carriage window as he briefly follows , the horses outpacing him . 
 Twenty years later , Jane , now a successful author and by choice unmarried , sees Tom during a gathering . Henry , now married to Eliza , brings Tom to her . Tom introduces his eldest daughter , who admires Jane 's novels . As she asks Jane to read aloud , he <unk> her by her name , also Jane . Astonished that he named his eldest after her , Jane agrees to read . The last scene shows Tom 's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from Pride and Prejudice , while Tom watches Jane affectionately . As she concludes , their eyes meet , and Tom joins the rest of the company in honouring Jane and her work with applause .

 In 2004 , screenwriter Sarah Williams approached Douglas Rae and Robert Bernstein of Ecosse Films with the intention of creating a film about the life of Jane Austen , a popular eighteenth century English novelist . Williams had recently read Becoming Jane Austen , a 2003 biography that largely pieced together several known facts , such as Austen 's meeting Tom Lefroy on Christmas 1795 , into a coherent story about unrequited love . Bernstein agreed to adapt the work , believing that it depicted " a pivotal relationship in Jane Austen 's early life that was largely unknown to the public . " The book 's author , Jon Hunter Spence , was hired as a historical consultant on the film , with the task of " see [ ing ] that , given that the ' story ' is a work of imagination , the factual material was as accurate as possible within the limitations of the story . " 
 After Williams completed several drafts of the screenplay , the company hired Kevin Hood to aid in further script development . Bernstein believed that Hood 's past work contained " a romantic sensibility ... There is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth which I thought was important for Jane . " Hood was attracted to the film because he believed " the story is such an important one and very much the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice . " Calling Austen a " genius " and " one of the top two or three prose writers of all time " , Hood thought that her relationship with Lefroy " was absolutely essential in shaping her work . " Hood acknowledged however that Becoming Jane is " based on the facts as they are known and the majority of characters did exist , as did many of the situations and circumstances in the film . Some have been fictionalised , weaving together what we know about Austen 's world from her books and letters , creating a rich <unk> landscape . " 
 Julian Jarrold became attached to direct the film in early 2005 . It was his second feature film , after Kinky Boots , which was released later that year . According to Bernstein , he " liked [ Jarrold 's ] style as it was modern and visceral , and I just had a feeling that he was the right choice . This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also with a certain amount of brio and Julian was able to bring those two things to the production . " The director began work on the project in early 2006 , rereading the novels Pride and Prejudice , Sense and Sensibility , and Persuasion and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence 's book . Jarrold depended most heavily on the script , calling it " a rich , witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well . It is a love story but much more besides . Kevin 's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas . Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience . " The director intended to " bring Austen up to date by <unk> her up a bit " and adding " more life and energy and fun , " opining that past Austen adaptations had been " a little bit picture @-@ postcard and safe and sweet and nice . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Jarrold sought to make Becoming Jane " look and feel " realistic " so everything is not lit in a very glamorous Hollywood way . " According to him , " One of the key ideas in the film was to get away from the old , stuffy costume drama kind of feel of what Jane Austen is and to look at somebody before she becomes a genius , when she is in her early twenties and on the verge of writing her great thing ; she had a real exuberance for life , intelligent and independent and a sort of outsider in rural Hampshire , more intelligent than the people around her and kicking against all those pressures . " To further set his film apart from other costume dramas , American actress Anne Hathaway was cast as the title character . A fan of Jane Austen since she was fourteen , Hathaway immediately began rereading Austen 's books , conducting historical research including perusing the author 's letters , and also learned sign language , calligraphy , dance choreography , and playing the piano . She moved to England a month before production began to improve her English accent , and attempted to stay in character throughout filming , the first time she had done so for a movie . 
 There were concerns in some quarters that the American Hathaway was playing a beloved English writer . James McAvoy , who plays Thomas Langlois Lefroy , believed that filming in Ireland made her casting " a bit safer " than if they had shot in England . McAvoy accepted the role because he enjoyed Austen 's writings and was eager to work with Jarrold , having collaborated with him previously on the 2002 television production White Teeth . McAvoy first assumed that Becoming Jane would be directly associated with Pride and Prejudice , with his character possessing similarities with Mr. Darcy ; the actor soon realised however " that the screenplay was nothing like Pride and Prejudice . The screenwriter probably speculated on some of the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice but it is a completely different story . " 
 Julie Walters had once disliked Austen 's writings but changed her mind when she read Pride and Prejudice after receiving her role as Mrs. Austen . Appearing as Mr. Austen was actor James Cromwell , who viewed his character as " a generous gentleman , well educated and supportive of Jane for the most part . He is <unk> by his financial circumstances but deeply in love with his wife and sympathetic to her concerns about what will happen to the girls if they don 't marry . " Joe Anderson portrayed Henry Austen , while Lucy Cohu played the widowed Eliza de <unk> , the Austens ' worldly cousin and Henry 's romantic interest . Cohu believed that her character " needs security . She is looking to be safe . She finds that security with Henry as she knows the Austen family . " 
 Anna Maxwell Martin appeared as Jane 's sister Cassandra . The actress called her character " terribly sensible " , noting that she " gets her heart broken . It 's very sad . She 's the levelling force for Jane Austen , the wild one . She tries to get her back in line , but fails miserably . " Becoming Jane also featured Laurence Fox as Mr. Wisley and Dame Maggie Smith as Lady Gresham , whom Jarrold viewed as possessing " similarities to Lady Catherine De Burgh in Pride and Prejudice but in this film you get to see her hidden vulnerabilities – the pain of never having had children and her controlling maternal power over Wisley . " Other cast members included Ian Richardson as Judge Langlois , Leo Bill as John Warren , Jessica Ashworth as Lucy Lefroy , Michael James Ford as Mr. Lefroy , Tom Vaughan @-@ Lawlor as Robert Fowle , and Helen McCrory as Mrs. Radcliffe . 
 = = = Costume design = = = 
 Irish costume designer <unk> Ní <unk> designed the clothing seen in the film . She attempted to create a different style of costumes than had been seen in recent Austen adaptations , and drew inspiration from the fashions of the 1790s , a time period she considered " fascinating " and a " very transitional era in terms of fashion ... it was a real challenge to make it work . " Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh attended the Cannes Film Festival in May 2006 but then had to quickly return to the Becoming Jane set to complete the last two days of filming . She later collaborated with Jarrold in the 2008 drama film Brideshead Revisited . 
 For research , Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh visited museums and art galleries , and also read Austen 's letters and novels . She was interested in both the effects of continental fashions on English clothing and the differences between social classes . While she recognised that 1795 " marked the beginning " of the empire waistline trend , Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh also understood this fashion would have barely been introduced to Austen 's circle in the country ; rather , the film displayed many costume designs from the early 1790s . She explained , " We wanted to show that transition especially for the women . The look in London is very different from the look in the countryside . For the country ball the fashion for the older women is more of the old style but for the younger women we show the introduction of the Empire line . " 
 The costume designer created all of Hathaway 's outfits from scratch , and " looked for images of a young Jane Austen . " Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh explained , " I wanted to get her youthfulness and innocence across through her dress . But crucially there was also her strength of character . So we kept away from frills and <unk> . I wanted a definite look that was quite strong but also pretty at the same time . Jane was living on a working farm so her dress had to be practical as well . In terms of the costume we were definitely trying to steer away from the chocolate box image that we associate with Jane Austen . " 
 Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh dressed McAvoy in rich fabrics , such as velvet and beaver fur , to help distinguish him from the other men . She recalled that " he wears very stylish waist coats and cut @-@ away jackets . With Jane around he 'd have an extra swagger in front of her . James ( McAvoy ) was really into it . We 'd talk about the colours and fabrics to achieve his distinctive look . " Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh and Maggie Smith agreed that Lady Gresham 's dresses would be modelled after 1770s fashion , which was " the sort of dress that the character would have worn when she was much younger and suited her back then . Lady Gresham is very much her own character and is not someone who is dictated to by fashion . " Smith 's dresses contained stiff fabrics " to emphasise a woman who was very set in her ways " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Produced independently by Ecosse , Becoming Jane was given a limited budget of € 12 @.@ 7 million ( £ 9 million or $ 16 @.@ 5 million ) . Production designer Eve Stewart researched Regency literature and Austen 's life , and along with Jarrold , scouted locations in Dublin and nearby counties for five weeks in January and February 2006 . They ultimately opted to shoot in Dublin and the Irish counties of Meath and Wicklow instead of Hampshire , the birthplace of Austen , because it held " a sense of countryside that felt more unchanged , " while Hampshire had unfortunately become too " groomed and manicured " . Jarrold also found " a great variety of Georgian houses and older houses " in Ireland . His production received funds from the Irish Film Board , the UK Film Council Premiere Fund , 2 Entertain , Scion Films , and Miramax Films . Film critic Andrew Sarris noted that in Ireland " happily , there are still architectural traces of life more than 200 years ago to correspond with the year 1795 . " However , Ireland did include a few disadvantages : Stewart found that " the rural aspects were the most difficult as the Irish country landscape is nothing like Hampshire . There are no rolling hills so the vegetation and the landscaping was the trickiest thing for me as a production designer . " 
 Due to its low budget , Becoming Jane was filmed on a " tight " schedule of eight weeks from March to May 2006 . Jarrold observed however that because Ecosse was not a film studio , he had more creative freedom . Bernstein stated of filming , " We recreated a world that Jane Austen lovers can recognise and associate with . But hopefully we can also take them into areas and places like the boxing club , the cricket game and the fair that do not feature in Jane Austen 's fiction . They are sort of seedy and dangerous areas that are not normally associated with Austen . " Jarrold found filming " very difficult . We had to make it work in the locations that we had as efficiently as possible . " Filming outdoors was often so cold that Hathaway turned blue and had difficulty saying her lines ; Automated Dialogue Replacement in post @-@ production helped correct this by re @-@ dubbing her lines . 
 The story 's central location was set at Steventon rectory where Austen was raised . While it had been demolished in 1824 , Jarrold and his crew " fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original ... We honed the script as well to make it as practical as possible . " Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth , " I think that you will lose the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen 's and that they are pretty poor . Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced her view of the world . You have to believe that the family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw . " Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in <unk> House , a few miles off Trim in County Meath . Later in fall 2006 , it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in Northanger Abbey . 
 Charleville Castle stood in for the interior scenes of Lady Gresham 's estate , while <unk> House , an old Elizabethan revival estate , provided the exterior shots of the property . Other filming sites included <unk> Bridge in the Dublin Mountains ( as Mr. Austen 's rectory ) and Dublin 's Henrietta Street and North Great George 's Street as Regency London . A house on Henrietta Street also provided the filming site for Mrs. Radcliffe 's residence . Gentleman Jackson 's club , where Lefroy boxes , was represented by " the dark and otherworldly " Mother <unk> tavern , also in Dublin . 
 = = Music and soundtrack = = 
 The musical score of the film was written by English composer Adrian Johnston . To prepare melodies , he reviewed music books that had belonged to the Austen family . The first track , " First Impressions , " has been described as a " depressing " song that " exhibits slow , pure and classical piano work ; one critic quipped that it belonged in " Becoming Sylvia Plath " . Later tracks ranged " in mood from upbeat and playful to somber and teary . " In his review of the score , Tim Clark of Soundtrack.net lamented the " absence of a truly memorable theme , despite a wealth of thematic material , " and found similarities to Dario Marianelli 's composition for the 2005 film Pride & Prejudice . 
 Patsy Morita , a music critic for Allmusic , wrote that the second half of Johnston 's score becomes as " unremarkable " as " so many other dramatic film scores of the early twenty @-@ first century . " She continued , " It fulfills its purpose of underscoring the emotion of the story by being moody and slow to change melodically and harmonically , and by using many pregnant pauses and minimalist @-@ leaning repetitive figures . " Morita added that " there is nothing in it to draw attention away from the film . " The score later received a nomination for Best Original Film Score at the 2008 Ivor Novello Awards . The film soundtrack was released on 31 July 2007 . A track listing for the album is as follows : 
 Henry Purcell 's " Hole in the Wall , " also known as " St. Martin 's Lane , " which is featured in the ballroom scene , was first published in 1695 and is highly unlikely to have been common during the Regency , when Jane Austen was a young adult .

 Jon Spence , the author of the biography the film was based on , identifies " Tom Lefroy as the love of Austen 's life and her relationship with him as the origin of her genius . But he never suggests that there was an aborted elopement ( much less subsequent reading sessions with any of Lefroy 's children ) . And he is careful , as the filmmakers are not , to clarify that in speculating about Austen 's romantic experience he is reading between the lines of the family records and of the three rather opaque Austen letters that are his principal sources . " 
 An important deviation of the film 's plot from history is that there is scant evidence in real life Austen and Lefroy 's relationship went beyond acquaintance . Rather , all that is known of them together is that they danced at three Christmas balls before Tom returned to school and that Jane was " too proud " to ask his aunt about him two years later . In the latter years of Tom Lefroy 's life , he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew , and admitted to having loved Jane Austen , but stated that it was a " boyish love " . As is written in a letter sent from <unk> Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870 @,@ 
 My late venerable uncle ... said in so many words that he was in love with her , although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love . As this occurred in a friendly & private conversation , I feel some doubt whether I ought to make it public . 
 Lori Smith , author of The Jane Austen Guide to Life , opined that : 
 No doubt this relationship and her [ Jane 's ] repartee with Tom fueled her writing . Whether it was " her greatest inspiration " as the trailers for Becoming Jane claim , well , that 's debatable . But I 'm sure it provided as spark . 
 However , contrary to the film 's story line , Jane had attempted her first full @-@ length novel before she met Tom and had already read The History of Tom Jones , a Foundling before meeting him . In a cut scene from the movie , it is clear that she is reading the novel for the second time , but in the theatrical release without that scene , it appears he introduces her to it . 
 = = = Representation of Austen characters in story = = = 
 Various commentators have offered opinions concerning the presence in the film of characters and themes from Austen 's works , particularly with Pride and Prejudice . Deborah Cartmell contended that Hathaway 's Austen is a " replica of Elizabeth Bennet ( with a touch of impetuous Lydia thrown in ) , " and added that the associations between Austen and Elizabeth are " more explicit than in " any other Austen biopic . Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph declared that the film took " good old P & P 's storyline and replace [ d ] Elizabeth Bennet with Austen herself [ and added ] a real @-@ life pseudo @-@ Darcy from the <unk> of biographical evidence . " A Companion to Jane Austen observed that the " physicality " of Jane and Lefroy 's kiss was similar to the " passionate kiss " between Elizabeth and Darcy in the 1995 serial Pride and Prejudice . 
 Empire magazine further expressed that 
 The characters <unk> the young Jane ’ s life are plainly recognisable as the prototypes for her most celebrated characters : Walters ’ anxious mother and Cromwell ’ s strong , fair @-@ minded Mr. Austen are clear relatives of Pride & Prejudice 's Mr. and Mrs. Bennet ; Smith ’ s aloof , disdainful dowager exemplifies the snobbery and social climbing that provide context for Austen ’ s romances ; McAvoy ’ s cocksure , worldly Lefroy is the epitome of the outwardly arrogant , inwardly sensitive hero of whom Mr. Darcy is the paradigm , while Jane herself shares the wit and passion of Austen ’ s most beloved heroine , Lizzie Bennet . 
 = = = Place in mass marketing = = = 
 The implementation of mass marketing in the film 's production and release has attracted notice from film and literary scholars . Dianne F. Sadoff writes that Becoming Jane " confirms the two @-@ decades @-@ long <unk> of Jane Austen . " According to Andrew Higson , the film was another example of " Austen Power " and the desire of filmmakers to " exploit the possibilities of both the Austen industry and the market for literary cinema and television – and more generally , the market for ' traditional ' English drama . " While reviewing Austen adaptations of the 1990s and 2000s in her book Heritage Film : Nation , Genre and Representation , author Belén Vidal viewed Becoming Jane as yet another " transformation of Austen 's novels into icons of popular culture . " To Vidal , this and other productions , such as The Jane Austen Book Club ( 2007 ) and Miss Austen Regrets ( 2008 ) , confirmed " the generic status of the Austen phenomenon whilst dispensing with the incorporation of the literary text . " 
 Becoming Jane followed a different formula than the Austen adaptations of the 1990s and attempted to draw viewers from a variety of demographic groups . Hathaway 's casting was intended to attract young female viewers who had enjoyed the actress in The Princess Diaries and The Princess Diaries 2 : Royal Engagement . According to producers , the view was that this demographic group would have been in their early teens during the release of the Princess films , making them " the right age " for Austen as 15 @-@ year @-@ olds . Expecting Becoming Jane to be a popular film , in February 2007 Penguin Books announced new editions of six of Austen 's best @-@ known novels ; their redesigned covers were intended to attract teenage readers . 
 = = = Heritage and other themes = = = 
 Becoming Jane has been referred to as a heritage costume drama film , a genre which has been popular in the United States among both its audiences and its film studios . According to Andrew Higson , Becoming Jane falls into the continuing trend of American attitudes influencing English film . Belén Vidal wrote that the film " exploit [ s ] a well @-@ defined heritage iconography and strategically combine [ s ] American stars with supporting casts of international ' quality ' players . " Hilary Radner analysed the presence of the " marriage plot " – a girl succeeding only by marrying the man of her choice – in film and television , and noted that while Becoming Jane critiques this film trope , it " points to the power of the traditional marriage plot as a residual paradigm influencing feminine identity . " 
 Jarrold 's adaptation also came in the wake of a number of literary biographical films , such as Shakespeare in Love and Miss Potter . Deborah Cartmell , author of Screen Adaptations : Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice : A Close Study of the Relationship between Text and Film , found similarities between Becoming Jane and Shakespeare in Love " almost so obvious that the [ former ] film risks the accusation of being dangerously derivative . " A given example included the characters of Austen and William Shakespeare inputting their personal experiences directly into their works . Marina Cano López and Rosa María García @-@ <unk> explained that the film " follows the path opened by John Madden ’ s Shakespeare in Love . The numerous intertextual connections between both movies can be reduced to one : just as Shakespeare is imagined as the hero of his own play , Jane Austen becomes the heroine of her own novel . " Among other listed similarities , they noted that the romantic interests of both protagonists serve as their literary muses , and that the middle part of both films " lie " when viewed from a historical perspective .

The film was expected to perform well during all seven days of the week and gradually gain more viewers during its time in cinemas . Due to the presence of recognizable stars such as Hathaway , Becoming Jane was expected to also do well among mainstream audiences .

 Film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 57 % based on reviews from 136 critics . The site summarized the consensus : " Although Becoming Jane is a well @-@ crafted period piece , it lacks fresh insight into the life and works of Jane Austen . The film focuses too much on wardrobe and not enough on Austen 's achievements . " The New York Times called the film a " triumph " for Hathaway , but observed that " the screenplay ’ s pseudo @-@ Austen tone is so consistent that its lapses into modern romance @-@ novel fantasy [ and ] threatens to derail the film . " More positive , Entertainment Weekly called the film " a charmer , " articulating that " the supporting cast ( Julie Walters , Maggie Smith , James Cromwell ) is top @-@ drawer ; and Anne Hathaway , with her <unk> beauty and frank demeanor , is a welcome Jane . " 
 Critics lauded Hathaway and McAvoy for the chemistry between their characters , finding that it lent authenticity to the love story between Austen and Lefroy . While Hathaway was admired for her performance by some critics , some reviews negatively focused on her nationality as well as the inauthenticity of her accent . James McAvoy defended the decision of casting Hathaway by stating that a director should , " find the right actor … and [ she ] is undoubtedly brilliant . " Hathaway herself admitted the persistent tendency to " sound too much like myself and not at all like Jane " , blaming cold weather in Ireland , which meant she had to do voice retakes for several scenes . Nonetheless , Jarrold praised Hathaway for her performance . In a wrap up party after the filming , the director confessed that the actress had been a different person , " not just her accent but also the whole character , the way of holding yourself and speaking was so completely different " . 
 Time Out London gave a positive review , enunciating that " Overall , the approach is less <unk> contrived than you ’ d expect , and though the alignment of circumstance and social status thwarting innocent passions is hardly fresh , it ’ s handled with thoughtful decorum . The emotional temperature ’ s rather restrained as a result , but with luxury casting all down the line , ... elegant visuals balancing verdant and velvet , and a delightful faux @-@ classical score , it ’ s a classy package , all right – just missing the extra spark . " Some reviewers have questioned the historical accuracy of the film , for instance critiquing the depicted relationship between Austen and Lefroy .

 Becoming Jane and the 2008 BBC serial Sense and Sensibility have been credited with " renew [ ing ] interest " in Jane Austen 's House Museum in Chawton . According to Robin <unk> , the chief executive of Bath Tourism Plus , Bath , Somerset gained " more than £ 150 @,@ 000 worth of free media exposure " in the wake of Becoming Jane and Persuasion , a 2007 television production adapted from another Austen novel . As the city is heavily associated with Austen , the company took advantage of Becoming Jane 's release in order to celebrate the author and her writings . In late September 2007 , Bath launched the seventh Jane Austen festival , which included a parade of people in Regency costumes , readings , tours , and discussions about the author . In addition , the city offered events such as Tea with Mr. Darcy to mark the release of the Becoming Jane DVD . 
 The film 's production had a positive impact on the Irish economy , as it resulted in a direct expenditure of € 7 @.@ 1 million , providing jobs for 116 crew members and 17 actors , and also offered 1 @,@ 250 days of work for extras . John O 'Donoghue , the country 's Minister for Arts , Sport and Tourism , visited the set and stated 
 The Irish economy continues to directly benefit from having major feature films such as Becoming Jane shoot on location here . As well as the direct benefits to the local economy such as job creation and tourism , it is also important to have images of Ireland screened to international audiences around the world . Encouraging feature films to shoot in Ireland remains a major priority for the Irish Government and we hope that the recent changes to Section 481 will mean that Ireland remains a competitive international location for feature film .

 The crew of Pamiat ' <unk> pledged its allegiance to the Ukrainian People 's Republic on 12 November 1917 soon after the October Revolution . The occupation of the Ukrainian People 's Republic by the Red Army early in 1918 led it to lay up on 28 March 1918 with her guns stripped by Bolsheviks to equip armoured trains . She was captured by the Germans on 1 May 1918 after being left behind in Sevastopol due to its uselessness and used as a barracks ship . She was renamed to Hetman Ivan Mazepa on 17 September 1918 and formally handed over to the Ukrainian State 's Navy . 
 Upon the end of the World War I and withdrawal of the Armed Forces of Central powers , she fell into the hands of the Whites under the support of the Triple Entente in November 1918 . She had her engines sabotaged in April 1919 by order of the British when the Whites temporarily lost control of Sevastopol . She was further damaged by the explosion of a mine when the Whites abandoned the Crimea in 1920 . Once she fell into Soviet hands she spent several years under repair , which required parts and material from her sisters that were even more damaged . She was given the proper revolutionary name of Komintern , after the Communist International on 31 December 1922 and was recommissioned in June 1923 . 
 She was refitted in 1930 as a training cruiser and lost four boilers which were converted to classrooms . Six of her waist guns were replaced by four obsolete 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) / 50 guns . Her submerged broadside torpedo tubes were also removed during this refit . She collided with Krasny Kavkaz in 1932 and seriously damaged the forecastle of the latter ship . Sources are unclear when she was rearmed , but it probably wasn 't until the late 1930s , probably when her forward smokestack was also removed . She landed all of her 75 mm / 50 guns in exchange for a modern suite of anti @-@ aircraft guns : three single 76 @.@ 2 mm ( 3 @.@ 00 in ) , three single 45 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) 21 @-@ K , two single 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) and five 12 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) machine guns . In 1941 she was modified as a minelayer and could carry 195 mines , but her speed had been reduced to 12 knots .

During the Crimean Campaign Komintern delivered supplies to the 44th Army at Feodosiya on 1 January 1942 and ferried troops and supplies to Sevastopol for the next several months . 
 She was badly damaged by a German air attack on 11 March , but was able to continue under her own power . She was damaged again in Novorossiysk by I.

 = Action of 12 May 1796 = 
 The Action of 12 May 1796 was a minor naval engagement during the French Revolutionary Wars between a squadron of British Royal Navy frigates and a frigate and four smaller ships of the Navy of the Batavian Republic . The British squadron had been detached on the previous day from the British North Sea fleet under Admiral Adam Duncan , which was cruising off the Batavian fleet anchorage at the Texel , while the Batavian squadron was returning to the Netherlands from the Norwegian coast where it had been sheltering since suffering defeat at the Action of 22 August 1795 the previous year . As the Batavian squadron neared the Batavian coast , the British squadron under Captain Lawrence Halstead attacked . 
 In his frigate HMS Phoenix , Halstead was able to cut the Batavian frigate Argo off from the shore and bring it to battle , forcing it to surrender in just 20 minutes as other British ships closed with the combat . The remainder of the Batavian squadron had dispersed eastwards away from the frigates and Duncan 's fleet , pursued by the frigate HMS Pegasus and brig @-@ sloop HMS Sylph . After a lengthy chase , Phoenix caught the cutter Duke of York , Sylph seized the brig Mercury , while Pegasus succeeded in driving the other brigs , Echo and Gier ashore , where both were believed wrecked . Duncan 's blockade of the Texel was instrumental in British control of the North Sea , and a year later it would achieve a decisive victory at the Battle of Camperdown .

 In February 1793 , the French Republic declared war on the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic , drawing both into the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars . Less than two years later , in the winter of 1794 – 1795 , the Dutch Republic was overrun by the French Army , French cavalry charging the Dutch Navy across the ice that blocked its winter anchorages , capturing it intact . The French reorganised the country into a client state named the Batavian Republic , and ordered the Dutch Navy to operate in the North Sea against British maritime trade routes . The British government did not immediately declare war on the Batavian Republic , but did take steps to seize Dutch shipping in British ports and established a new fleet to combat Batavian operations in the North Sea . The North Sea Fleet , as it was known , was composed mainly of older and smaller vessels not considered suitable for service in the Channel Fleet , and command of this force was given to the 66 – year old Admiral Adam Duncan . 
 In August 1795 , the Batavian Navy sent a frigate squadron to operate against the British trade routes with Scandinavia , which carried large quantities of British naval stores to supply the British fleets . These trade routes passed from the Baltic Sea through the Kattegat and Skaggerak channels and across the North Sea , and the Batavian squadron consequently cruised at the mouth of the Kattegat off the southern coast of neutral Danish controlled Norway . To counteract this Batavian operation , Duncan sent a squadron of British frigates from the North Sea Fleet under the command of Captain James Alms with orders to intercept and destroy the Batavian ships . On 22 August , Alms 's force discovered the Batavian squadron close to the Norwegian harbour of Eigerøya . Alms closed with the Batavian force in an attempt to cut it off from land , but was only able to intercept the Batavian frigate <unk> with his ship HMS Stag , compelling the Batavian vessel to surrender in a short engagement . Although the remainder of his squadron exchanged fire with the Batavian ships , damaging the frigate Argo , Alms ' force was unable to prevent their escape into Eigerøya . 
 For the rest of the year , Argo operated from the Norwegian coast , unable to make and significant cruises due to the attention of British warships operating in the region . By May 1796 , Duncan 's fleet was now actively cruising against the Batavian Navy , commanding a blockade force of nine ships of the line and numerous smaller vessels at sea off the Texel , the principal Batavian fleet anchorage . Duncan also ensured that the blockade of the Batavian vessels in Norwegian ports was maintained , with the 28 – gun frigate HMS Pegasus under Captain Ross Donnelly and the brig @-@ sloop HMS Sylph under Commander John Chambers White sent to patrol the waters off <unk> . In early May , the Batavian authorities ordered Argo to return to the fleet at the Texel , and the frigate sailed from the Norwegian port of <unk> on 11 May with three Batavian brigs : Echo of 18 – guns , Mercury of 16 – guns and Gier of 14 – guns . 
 The departure of the Batavian squadron was noticed by Donnelly 's small blockade force , which shadowed the Batavian ships as they passed southwards down the coast of Jutland , losing sight of them at 22 : 00 on 11 May . Donnelly correctly guessed the Batavian force 's destination , and ordered Sylph to separate , the two vessels following different courses , instructing White to proceed to Duncan 's blockade fleet and meet Donnelly there if he was unable to rediscover the Batavian squadron en route . Pegasus and Sylph encountered one another shortly before 05 : 00 on 12 May close to Duncan 's fleet south of the Texel but without having located the Batavian squadron . Argo and her consorts had sailed close to the Danish and German coasts during the night , seizing in passing a British cutter named Duke of York , travelling from Yarmouth to Hamburg . At dawn on 12 May the Batavian ships were off the Batavian coast sailing southwest towards the Texel anchorage . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On hearing Donnelly 's report , Duncan immediately despatched a small squadron to the mouth of the Texel to wait for the arrival of the Batavian squadron . Command of this squadron was given to Captain Lawrence Halstead in the 36 – gun frigate HMS Phoenix , accompanied by Pegasus , Sylph and the 50 – gun fourth rate HMS Leopard . The squadron detached at 05 : 00 and almost immediately the Batavian squadron was sighted to the southeast , heading for the entrance to the Texel , tacking against the northwest wind . Halstead 's force was not unified , with Pegasus and Sylph far ahead of Phoenix and Leopard , and the British commander decided to deliberately detach his forces , the faster Pegasus and Sylph pursuing the brigs under Donnelly 's command and Halstead 's rear force attacking the frigate Argo . Duncan 's main fleet , some distance behind Halstead , also sighted the Batavian squadron and joined the chase . 
 The Batavian captain , finding such a large force bearing down on him , ordered the brigs and cutter to separate from the frigate , turning with the wind in an effort to escape with Donnelly close behind . He also turned Argo away from the pursuing Phoenix , but was unable to decide whether to fight or flee and as a result changed course a number of times . This inevitably slowed his ship , and at 08 : 15 Phoenix was able to come alongside with the advantage of the weather gage . Halstead fired a shot across the Batavian ship 's bow as a warning to surrender to such overwhelming odds , but the Batavian captain refused and opened fire on the British frigate . Although Argo made strenuous efforts to escape during the exchange of fire , Halstead 's ship was both more accurate and effective , mounting 36 18 @-@ pounder cannon and 8 32 @-@ pounder carronades to the Batavian frigate 's 12 @-@ pounder main battery supplemented with a number of cannon of lower calibres . In just 20 minutes , Phoenix had torn much of Argo 's rigging , sails and masts and inflicted heavy casualties of eight killed and 28 wounded . With his ship damaged , Duncan 's fleet in sight and Leopard not far behind Phoenix , the Batavian captain surrendered at 08 : 35 , allowing Halstead to take possession of his vessel . 
 Phoenix was joined soon after the surrender of Argo by the 74 – gun ship of the line HMS Powerful under Captain William O 'Bryen Drury and together the ships took possession of the frigate while the chase of the remainder of the Batavian squadron continued . At 10 : 00 two of the brigs turned towards the Batavian coastline to seek shelter and two of the leading British ships , Pegasus and the 50 – gun HMS Leander under Captain Maurice <unk> , turned in chase . Donnelly sought to interpose his ships between the brigs and the coast , but found that this would have slowed his vessels so much that the Batavian brigs would have an opportunity to escape . He therefore maintained pursuit and watched the Batavian ships , Gier and Echo driven ashore at the Batavian village of Bosch . Sailing as close to the shore line as safely possible , <unk> detached cutters to investigate the state of the grounded ships , determining that one had been damaged beyond repair while the other , having initially grounded , had been driven over the shoal into deeper water on the far side . In his report on the action , Duncan considered that a storm which swept the area on the day following the action probably drove the brig back onto the shoal and destroyed it . 
 The last survivors of the Batavian squadron were harried along the coast by the faster forces in the British fleet with Sylph overhauling the 16 @-@ gun Mercury , forcing it to surrender just before 11 : 00 . The Batavian captain had thrown 14 cannon overboard in an effort to lighten his ship and allow it to escape British pursuit , but without success . Later in the day , Halstead 's Phoenix was able to seize the Batavian prize Duke of York , completing the destruction of the entire Batavian squadron . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Halstead brought his prizes back to Britain , where both Argo and Mercury were purchased for service by the Royal Navy as HMS Janus and HMS Hermes respectively as both of the Batavian names were already in use by the Royal Navy . British losses in the engagement were one man killed and three wounded , all suffered on Phoenix during the engagement with Argo . Apart from the losses in that exchange , no other casualties , either British or Batavian were reported . The action was the only significant engagement fought off the Batavian coast during 1796 as Duncan 's force kept the main Batavian fleet contained within its anchorage in the Texel . In October 1797 however the main Batavian fleet was able to break out and sail on a raiding cruise towards the English coast . Duncan intercepted the fleet on its return to the Texel and inflicted a decisive defeat on the Batavians on 11 October at the Battle of Camperdown . 
 = Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw = 
 Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw ( Polish : Sejm Księstwa Warszawskiego ) was the parliament of the Duchy of Warsaw . It was created in 1807 by Napoleon , who granted a new constitution to the recently created Duchy . It had limited competences , including having no legislative initiative . It met three times : for regular sessions in 1809 and 1811 , and for an extraordinary session in 1812 . In the history of Polish parliament , it succeeded the Sejm of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth and was followed by the Sejm of the Congress Poland . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1807 Napoleon created the Duchy of Warsaw and granted it a constitution . Like with all Napoleonic legislatures , it was inferior in political power to executive by design . 
 The Sejm had met three times : for regular sessions in 1809 and 1811 , and for an extraordinary session of 1812 . The Sejm was mainly occupied with administration and financial matters ; its final act , in 1812 , was to create the last Polish confederation , the General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland . 
 = = Composition and duration = = 
 The Sejm was composed of two chambers : a chamber of deputies and a senate . The chamber of deputies was composed of 100 deputies , in 1810 increased to 166 . The initial 100 was composed of 60 deputies ( after 1810 , 100 ) elected from the ranks of the nobility ( szlachta ) during the sessions of the local parliaments ( sejmiks ) , and 40 non @-@ noble deputies ( after 1810 , 66 ) , as well as members of the Council of State . The deputy candidates had to be 24 years or older , and government officials , priests or officers in active military service were not eligible for candidacy . They were elected for a nine @-@ year term of office , in three tranches ( elections for a third of the deputies were to be held every three years ) . 
 The senate was composed of bishops , voivodes and castellans ; all nominated by the king . They numbered six each , in 1810 increased to ten each . 
 Those enfranchised to vote included landowners , owners of large businesses , clergy , artists , scientists , and the military . Notably , peasants could vote as well , provided they owned the land . 
 The Sejm session lasted fifteen days , and was convened every two years . 
 Notable politicians of the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw included : Józef Godlewski , Tomasz A. Ostrowski , Stanisław Sołtyk , Stanisław Staszic , Wawrzyniec Surowiecki and Józef Wybicki . 
 = = Competences = = 
 The competences of the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw were limited compared to its predecessor , the Sejm of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth . It had no legislative initiative ( that was limited to the executive , represented by the king and the Council of State ) , and could only accept or refuse ( by simple majority ) the legislation on the issues of treasury ( finances and taxes ) and civil and criminal law , presented to it by the executive . Further , discussions were limited , as only the members of the five @-@ person strong committees ( one for treasury and one for each of the two laws ) , elected in secret ballot and tasked with the analysis of the proposed legislation , and members of the Council of State , had the right to speak . In practice , the members of the Sejm found a way to overcome this limitation , as after the day session would be officially closed , the deputies would remain in the parliament and start a new discussion . 
 The senate was to supervise the chamber of deputies , ensuring it acts according to the constitution , and ensure the proper procedure during the elections . The senate could object to a legislation , but could be overruled by the king . 
 The king had the right to dissolve the chamber of deputies , or replace senators with new nominees . 
 = Focus Grill = 
 " Focus Grill " is the thirteenth episode of the fourth season and the series finale of the American animated sitcom Home Movies , and 52nd episode of the series overall . It originally aired in the United States on Adult Swim on April 4 , 2004 . In the episode , Brendon , Melissa , and Jason decide to finally film an ending to the first movie they did together . 
 " Focus Grill " was written by Brendon Small and directed by Loren Bouchard . Despite struggling with the knowledge of the show 's cancellation since the start of the fourth season production run , Small noted that this final episode was actually an optimistic note for the series . The episode concludes with Brendon 's camera breaking , which Small believed was a way to finally eliminate the hindrances of the character 's metaphorical crutch . 
 The final episode received a largely positive response , with reviewers praising it for its sentimental , bittersweet way of concluding the show . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Brendon , Melissa , and Jason decide to start screening their movies in front of a focus group that consists of their schoolmates Fenton , Junior , Perry , and Walter . The group members harshly criticize this latest movie , and in the midst of trying to find the flaw in it , the three friends discover that the first movie they ever made together — in which they are a biker gang contemplating whether or not to fight an unknown adversary — is missing an ending . The three cannot agree on a conclusion for the movie , so they decide that each of them will create their own , and then screen the three potential endings in front of the focus group . All of their endings , however , are harshly criticized . The three sit down and watch a reel composed of scenes from several of their film projects ; they come to the consensus that their movies are designed only for them and should not actually be seen by anyone else . 
 Meanwhile , Coach McGuirk volunteers to assemble Paula 's large and complicated new grill , but he proves to be both incredibly inexperienced and largely incompetent at performing such a task . When McGuirk believes that he has finally completed the grill , he gathers Paula and the three kids together to witness its first ignition , but he ultimately causes a large explosion . The five go off on a drive , covered in soot , and Brendon accidentally drops his camera on the road , where it is run over by a car . He groans " oh no , " and almost begins to tell the others about what had just happened , but ends up getting drawn into a conversation about where to go for dinner . 
 The episode and series concludes with Paula , McGuirk , Jason , Melissa , and Brendon chattering about tapas , as Brendon 's broken camera briefly shoots an empty road before the picture flickers and turns to static .

 The episode was written by Home Movies co @-@ creator Brendon Small , and was the final episode of the series ' production run . The episode was the fifty @-@ second of the series , a number that allows for an even distribution of reruns of the series ; Small noted that the technique is normally used on animated children 's shows , though Home Movies is actually created for an adult audience . 
 Small knew before writing the episode that it would be the last . Mike Lazzo , executive vice president of Adult Swim , had never " responded to the show " as Small had noted , which was in stark contrast to Vice President of Original Series Khaki Jones , whose enthusiasm over the series was what Small admitted to keeping it alive . During the production run for the fourth season , Lazzo had informed the crew bluntly that the season would conclude the series , explaining , " No matter what the numbers are , no matter what happens – we 're not going to bring the show back . " 
 Having been informed of this definite end of the series ' run , Small decided to write " Focus Grill " with the intention of it concluding the show . While penning the teleplay , he kept in mind the knowledge that " nothing positive [ is ] happening " ; however , Small did admit that the final scene of the episode — Brendon 's camera breaking on the road — was actually an optimistic footnote in the series ' narrative . Small considers that now that Brendon is without his camera , " he doesn 't need this crutch anymore . That he can actually start living his life as an actual earthling . " 
 " Focus Grill " , like all episodes , was directed by co @-@ creator Loren Bouchard , and as with every episode of Home Movies after its first season , the episode was animated using Macromedia Flash . The Squigglevision animation program is briefly used in one scene in the episode , where Brendon , Melissa , and Jason watch various movies of theirs from throughout the series , some of which are from the first season , in which the show utilized Squigglevision .

 " Focus Grill " originally aired on Adult Swim , a cable network that shares channel space with Cartoon Network , on April 4 , 2004 . After the episode aired , Small received several e @-@ mails from various fans , who told him that watching the episode had made them cry . The episode received a largely positive response from reviewers . C.S. <unk> of The Numbers wrote that it was " able to really wrap up the series in a great way and show why the characters acted the way they did " , and praised it for " [ showing ] some real character development . " Pop Matters ' Jesse Hassenger described it as both " bittersweet " and " hilarious " . 
 Writing for his DVD Talk review of the show 's tenth anniversary DVD boxset , Jason Bailey considered the episode " especially strong , drawing the series to a fine full circle , both structurally and thematically . " Bailey concurred with Hassenger 's description of it as bittersweet , writing : " It 's an affectionate send @-@ off , bittersweet and kind of wonderful and therefore perfectly in tone with this charming little show . " Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed described it as the epitome of the show 's various themes , including childhood , art , and family , calling it " a slightly nostalgic episode " ; he considered it an excellent way to close the series , writing " Acting as probably both a reflection of the show 's staff at the time and a final send off , I can 't think of a better way to send Brendon Small and Loren Bouchard 's creation into the sunset .

 = Blacknose shark = 
 The blacknose shark ( Carcharhinus acronotus ) is a species of requiem shark , belonging to the family Carcharhinidae , common in the tropical and subtropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean . This species generally inhabits coastal seagrass , sand , or rubble habitats , with adults preferring deeper water than juveniles . A small shark typically measuring 1 @.@ 3 m ( 4 @.@ 3 ft ) long , the blacknose has a typical streamlined " requiem shark " shape with a long , rounded snout , large eyes , and a small first dorsal fin . Its common name comes from a characteristic black blotch on the tip of its snout , though this may be indistinct in older individuals . 
 Blacknose sharks feed primarily on small bony fishes and cephalopods , and in turn fall prey to larger sharks . Like other members of their family , they exhibit a viviparous mode of reproduction in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection . The females give birth to three to six young in late spring or early summer , either annually or <unk> , after a gestation period of eight to 11 months . This species is not known to attack humans , though it has been documented performing a threat display towards divers . It is of moderate commercial and recreational importance . The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened . In 2009 , the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the populations of the blacknose shark off the United States are being overfished , and proposed new conservation measures . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The Cuban naturalist Felipe Poey published the first description of the blacknose shark in 1860 as Squalus acronotus , in his Memorias sobre la historia natural de la Isla de Cuba . Later authors moved this species to the genus Carcharhinus . The type specimen was a 98 @-@ cm ( 3 @.@ 2 @-@ ft ) -long male caught off Cuba . 
 Based on morphological data , Jack Garrick suggested in 1982 that the blacknose shark has a sister relationship to a group containing the whitecheek shark ( C. dussumieri ) and the blackspot shark ( C. sealei ) , while Leonard Compagno proposed in 1988 that this shark belongs in a group with five other species , including the silky shark ( C. falciformis ) and the blacktip reef shark ( C. melanopterus ) . Molecular analyses have been similarly equivocal regarding the blacknose shark 's phylogenetic relationships : Gavin Naylor 's 1992 allozyme analysis found this species to be the most basal member of Carcharhinus , while Mine Dosay @-@ <unk> 's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis indicated affinity between it and the blacktip shark ( C. limbatus ) or the smalltail shark ( C. porosus ) . The <unk> shark ( <unk> velox ) , found along the tropical western coast of the Americas , may be descended from blacknose sharks that experienced the teratogenic effects of incipient <unk> . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The blacknose shark inhabits the continental and insular shelves off the eastern coast of the Americas , as far north as North Carolina and as far south as southern Brazil , including the Bahamas , the Gulf of Mexico , and the Caribbean Sea . They frequent coastal waters over beds of seagrass , sandy flats , and shell or coral rubble . This species is spatially segregated by size and sex . Generally , only young sharks are encountered in shallow water , as the adults prefer depths greater than 9 m ( 30 ft ) and is most common at 18 – 64 m ( 59 – 210 ft ) . Blacknose sharks in the South Atlantic Bight ( off the Atlantic coast of the southern United States ) migrate northward in the summer and southward ( or possibly offshore ) in the winter ; a similar migration occurs for sharks in the Gulf of Mexico . 
 = = Description = = 
 The blacknose shark has a slender , streamlined body with a long , rounded snout and large eyes . There is a well @-@ developed flap of skin in front of each nostril , defining the inflow and outflow openings . Twelve to 13 and 11 to 12 tooth rows occur on either side of the upper and lower jaws , respectively , with one or two teeth at the symphysis ( middle ) . The teeth are triangular and oblique , with serrated edges ; the upper teeth are stouter than the lower teeth . The five pairs of gill slits are short , measuring less a third the length of the first dorsal fin base . 
 The first dorsal fin is small and somewhat sickle @-@ shaped , with a pointed apex and a short , free , rear tip ; its origin lies over the free rear tips of the pectoral fins . The second dorsal fin is relatively large , though still less than half the height of the first . No ridge is seen between the dorsal fins . The pectoral fins are short and tapered . The body is covered with overlapping dermal denticles that bear five to seven longitudinal ridges ( three in very young individuals ) leading to three to five marginal teeth . The coloration is yellowish to greenish @-@ gray or brown above and white to yellow below . A distinctive dark blotch at the tip of the snout is most obvious in young sharks . The tips of the second dorsal fin , upper caudal fin lobe , and sometimes the lower caudal fin lobe , are dark . Blacknose sharks are typically 1 @.@ 3 – 1 @.@ 4 m ( 4 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 6 ft ) long and 10 kg ( 22 lb ) in weight . The maximum length and weight on record is 2 @.@ 0 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) and 18 @.@ 9 kg ( 42 lb ) , respectively . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 A small , fast @-@ swimming predator , the blacknose shark feeds primarily on small , bony fishes , including pinfish , croakers , porgies , anchovies , spiny <unk> , and porcupinefish , as well as on octopus and other cephalopods . When competing for bait , their speed allows them to snatch food from larger sharks such as the Caribbean reef shark ( C. perezi ) . This species may form large schools that are sometimes associated with anchovies and mullet . Blacknose sharks demonstrate a high degree of philopatry : both juveniles and adults have been documented returning to the same local area year after year . 
 Blacknose sharks are preyed upon by larger sharks , and captives have been observed to perform an apparent threat display towards encroaching divers or newly introduced members of their species . The display consists of the shark hunching its back , lowering its pectoral fins , gaping its jaws , and swimming with an exaggerated side @-@ to @-@ side motion . Known parasites of this species include the copepods Nesippus orientalis , Perissopus dentatus , Pandarus sinuatus , Kroyeria <unk> , Nemesis atlantica , and Eudactylina spinifera , as well as tapeworms in the genera Paraorygmatobothrium and Platybothrium . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 As in other requiem sharks , the blacknose shark is viviparous : after the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk , the empty yolk sac develops into a placental connection through which the mother provides nourishment . Off the United States , males are thought to reproduce every year , while females reproduce every other year . However , off northeastern Brazil , the female reproductive cycle is short enough to occur annually . <unk> ( the formation of yolk within the ovary ) occurs in the late summer , and is immediately followed by mating and fertilization in the fall , with the young being born the following spring to summer . The seasonality of these events means the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres . The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months off northeastern Brazil and 9 – 11 months off the southeastern United States . 
 Females typically give birth to litters of one to six pups in shallow nursery areas , such as coastal bays or mangrove swamps ; one known nursery area is Bulls Bay off South Carolina . There is no relationship between female size and the number of young . The newborns measure 38 – 50 cm ( 15 – 20 in ) long . Female blacknose sharks grow more slowly , attain a larger ultimate size , and have a longer lifespan than males . In addition , Gulf of Mexico sharks are slower @-@ growing and longer @-@ lived than those from the South Atlantic Bight . In the South Atlantic Bight , both sexes mature at a fork length ( from snout tip to caudal fin fork ) of around 90 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) , corresponding to ages of 4 @.@ 3 years for males and 4 @.@ 5 years for females . In the Gulf of Mexico , both sexes mature at a fork length of around 85 cm ( 2 @.@ 79 ft ) , corresponding to ages of 5 @.@ 4 years for males and 6 @.@ 6 years for females . The maximum lifespan has been calculated as 19 years in South Atlantic Bight and 16 @.@ 5 years in the Gulf of Mexico . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The blacknose shark has never been implicated in an attack on humans . However , caution should be exercised if it begins to perform a threat display . This species is regarded as a game fish and offers a respectable fight on light tackle ( a more delicate fishing line ) . It is also of regional commercial importance , being taken intentionally and as bycatch via gillnets and surface longlines across its range , most significantly off southwestern Florida , Venezuela , and Brazil ; the meat is sold dried and salted . Large numbers of blacknose sharks are also caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers , which may pose a greater threat to its population , as many of the sharks taken are immature . 
 Off the United States , the fishing of the blacknose shark is regulated by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service 1993 Fisheries Management Plan ( FMP ) for Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico sharks . For the purposes of commercial quotas and bag limits , the blacknose shark is classified within the " small coastal shark " ( SCS ) complex . From 1999 to 2005 , an average of 27 @,@ 484 blacknose sharks ( 62 metric tons ) were caught each year off the United States . Recent stock assessments conducted by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) have determined the populations of this species have become overfished in both the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico . In 2009 , the NOAA proposed instituting a separate quota for blacknose sharks of 6 @,@ 065 sharks per year , and a ban on using gillnets to catch sharks in the Atlantic . By contrast , blacknose shark stocks off northern Brazil appear to be stable , while no fishery data are available from the Caribbean . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed this species as Near Threatened globally . 
 = Erromintxela language = 
 Erromintxela ( Basque pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) is the distinctive language of a group of Romani living in the Basque Country , who also go by the name Erromintxela . It is sometimes called Basque Caló or <unk> in English ; <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> in Spanish ; and <unk> @-@ <unk> or <unk> @-@ <unk> in French . Although detailed accounts of the language date to the end of the 19th century , linguistic research only began in the 1990s . 
 Erromintxela is a mixed language ( referred to as Para @-@ Romani in Romani linguistics ) , deriving most of its vocabulary from Kalderash Romani but using Basque grammar , similar to the way the <unk> language of the Roma in England mixes Romani vocabulary and English grammar . The development of this mixed language was facilitated by the unusually deep integration of the Erromintxela people into Basque society and the resultant bilingualism in Basque . The language is in decline ; most of the perhaps one thousand remaining speakers live on the coast of <unk> and in the mountainous regions of Soule , Navarre , Gipuzkoa and Biscay . The Erromintxela are the descendants of a 15th @-@ century wave of Kalderash Roma who entered the Basque Country via France . Both ethnically and linguistically , they are distinct from the Caló @-@ speaking Romani people in Spain and the <unk> Romani people of the Northern Basque Country . 
 = = Name = = 
 The origin of the name Erromintxela is unclear and may be of relatively recent origin ; Basque speakers had previously grouped the Erromintxela under more general terms for Romani such as ijitoak " Egyptians " , <unk> " Hungarians " , or <unk> " Bohemians " . However , a number of authors believe it to be a Basque rendering of the French name <unk> or <unk> @-@ <unk> , a name attested primarily in the vicinity of the Pyrenees and in particular the Northern Basque Country . <unk> is in turn a French rendering of the Romani phrase Romani <unk> " Romani person " . Though now uncommon in France , it is found in the names of the British <unk> and the Scandinavian <unk> , all descendants , like the Erromintxela , of a group of Roma who had migrated to France . 
 Early attestations of the name in Basque include <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> , later <unk> and <unk> . The initial E- is the Basque prosthetic vowel , added because no Basque word may begin with an <unk> , and the final -a is the absolutive case suffix , used when citing a name . If this etymology is correct , it is a rare case of a native Romani name for themselves ( an <unk> ) being borrowed by another language . 
 The people identify themselves as ijitoak , Basque for " gypsies " , but more specifically as Erromintxela , in contrast to the Caló Romani , whom they refer to as the <unk> @-@ <unk> , Basque for " red @-@ legs " . 
 = = State of the language = = 
 There are currently an estimated 500 speakers in the Southern Basque Country in Spain , approximately 2 % of a population of 21 @,@ 000 Romanis , and another estimated 500 in France . In Spain the remaining fluent speakers are elderly people mostly over the age of 80 ; some are equally fluent in Spanish , Basque , or Caló . Middle @-@ aged Erromintxela are mostly passive <unk> , and the youngest speak only Basque or Spanish . In the Northern Basque Country , however , the language is still being passed on to children . The percentage of speakers among Spanish Erromintxela are higher than 2 % , as large numbers of Caló @-@ speaking Romanis moved to the Basque Country in the intense period of industrialisation in the 20th century .

 To date , there has been little literary production in the language . The most notable works are a poem by Jon <unk> entitled " Kama @-@ goli " in his 1997 anthology <unk> and the 1999 novel <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by Koldo Izagirre <unk> with the main character using the language . 
 = = History = = 
 The Erromintxela arrived in the Basque Country in the 15th century speaking Kalderash Romani . They integrated much more deeply into Basque society than other Romani groups . In the process , they acquired the Basque language and adopted aspects of Basque culture such as increased rights of women and important traditions such as <unk> ( extemporaneous poetic song ) and <unk> ( the national Basque ballgame ) . Muñoz and Lopez de Mungia suspect that the morphological and phonological similarities between Romani and Basque facilitated the adoption of Basque grammar by the bilingual Romanis . 
 It appears that many Romanis chose to stay in the Basque Country to escape persecution elsewhere in Europe . Nonetheless , even here they were not safe from persecution . For example , the Royal Council of Navarre in 1602 passed an edict to round up all " vagabonds " ( meaning Romani ) , who were to be condemned to 6 years of galley duty . By the 18th century however attitudes had changed , and the emphasis shifted towards integration . In 1780 – 1781 the Courts of Navarre passed Law 23 , which called for " the authorities to take care of them , find them locations for settlement and honest occupations and ways of living ... " 
 = = Research = = 
 The oldest account of the language dates to 1855 , when the French ethnographer Justin Cenac @-@ <unk> located the Erromintxela primarily in the Northern Basque Country . The oldest coherent Erromintxela text , a poem entitled Kama @-@ goli , published by Basque writer Jon <unk> in a collection of Basque poetry , only dates to ca . 1960 . 
 Alexandre Baudrimont 's 40 @-@ page study <unk> de la langue des <unk> <unk> les pays <unk> français of 1862 , the most extensive of the early accounts , covers both vocabulary and aspects of grammar . He worked with two female informants , a mother and her daughter from the <unk> @-@ Mixe area near Saint @-@ Palais , whom he describes as highly fluent . Unfortunately , he was only able to conduct a single session as the women were then told not to cooperate further for the fear of outsiders prying into the secrets of the Romani . There is a certain degree of confusion in Baudrimont 's publication — he himself states that he could not always be certain the correct forms were elicited . For example , most of the verb forms he tried to elicit lack the verbal -tu ending and appear to be participles . 
 The French sociologist Victor de <unk> refers to the Romani in the Northern Basque Country speaking Basque , rather than French , in his 1876 Les <unk> de France et d 'Espagne ( <unk> et <unk> ) . The Canon Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> published a wordlist in the periodical <unk> Ona in 1906 and in 1921 <unk> and <unk> carried out some research . Although labelled <unk> ( Spanish for ' gypsy ' ) or <unk> / <unk> ( French for ' gypsy ' ) , some data can also be found in <unk> 's 1905 dictionary and Pierre <unk> 's 1926 dictionary , both of which list a number of words identifiable as Erromintxela . 
 Little more was done until the late 20th century . In 1986 Federico <unk> published a short article in the Revista Internacional de Estudios <unk> entitled " Los <unk> <unk> " , with a short word list and a brief analysis of the language 's morphology . However , the most detailed research to date was carried out by Basque philologist <unk> Muñoz and historian Elias Lopez de Mungia , who began their work in the Southern Basque Country in 1996 at the behest of the Romani organisation Kalé Dor Kayiko , with support from the <unk> and the University of the Basque Country . Kalé Dor Kayiko , who had been working to promote the Romani language , was alerted to the existence of Erromintxela in the 1990s through an article by the historian <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> eta ijitoak <unk> <unk> " <unk> , Jews , and Gypsies in the Basque Country " . Kalé Dor Kayiko intends to continue research into the language , attitudes , identity , and history of the Erromintxela people in the less well researched provinces of Navarre and the Northern Basque Country . 
 = = Linguistic features = = 
 The research by Muñoz and Lopez de Mungia has confirmed that Erromintxela is not derived from Caló , the mixed Spanish @-@ Romani language spoken throughout Spain , but is instead based on Kalderash Romani and the Basque language . The vocabulary appears to be almost exclusively Romani in origin ; the grammar however , both morphology and syntax , derives from various Basque dialects . Few traces appear to remain of Romani grammatical structures . The language is incomprehensible to speakers of both Basque and of Caló . 
 <unk> , Erromintxela displays the same features as the Basque dialects it derives its grammatical structures from . Its case marking follows the ergative – absolutive pattern where the subject of an intransitive verb is in the absolutive case ( which is unmarked ) , the same case being used for the direct object of a transitive verb . The subject of a transitive verb is marked with the ergative case . Similarly , auxiliary verbs agree with the subject and any direct object and indirect object present and verb forms are marked for <unk> ( i.e. a marker is used to indicate the gender of the addressee ) . 
 Since both Erromintxela and Caló derive from Romani , many Erromintxela words are similar to Spanish Caló and Catalan Caló . 
 = = = Phonology = = = 
 According to Baudrimont 's description of 1862 and modern southern sources , Erromintxela appears to have , at maximum , the sound system below . Southern speakers appear not to have the rounded vowel / y / or the consonant / θ / , in line with north @-@ south differences in Basque , and it is not clear if the northern distinction between / ɡ / and / ɣ / also exists in the south . 
 Baudrimont uses a semi @-@ phonetic system with the following diverging conventions :

 Examples of morphological features in Erromintxela :

 Most verbs have a Romani root plus the Basque verb forming suffix -tu . Examples of Erromintxela verbs are given below . ( Forms given in angle brackets indicate spellings in the sources which are no longer in use . Basque is included for comparison . ) 
 Most Erromintxela verbal inflections are virtually identical to those found in Basque dialects : 
 <unk> are formed with na / <unk> ( Romani na / <unk> ) ; cf Basque ez / <unk> . The word for " yes " is ua ( Romani va ) ; cf Basque bai / <unk> .

 The majority of nouns have Romani roots , but frequently attested with Basque suffixes .

 According to <unk> , the Erromintxela have adopted the Basque names of the months . Note that some of the Basque names represent pre @-@ standardisation names of the months , e.g. August is <unk> in Standard Basque rather than <unk> . 
 Baudrimont claims that subdivisions of the year ( apart from the months ) are formed with the word breja ( <unk> ) " year " : breja <unk> " month " and breja <unk> " week " .

 = = Baudrimont 's material = = 
 Much of Baudrimont 's wordlist is easily related to other Erromintxela sources . However , some of the material collected by Baudrimont deserves a more detailed overview due to its peculiarities . Most of these relate to the verbs and verb forms he collected but some include nouns and other items . 
 = = = Nouns = = = 
 His material contains a relatively high number of Basque @-@ derived items . 
 Certain items are peculiar . Baudrimont lists <unk> as " tooth " . The Kalderash term is <unk> ( <unk> in Caló ) but the term given is immediately more reminiscent of Northern Basque <unk> " speech " or <unk> " skin " ( with expressive palatalization ) . This , and other similar items , raise the question of whether Baudrimont was simply pointing at items to elicit forms . 
 The forms he attempted to elicit are questionable in some cases as well . For example he attempted to agricultural terms such as plough , harrow and aftermath from his ( female ) informants and records the suspiciously similar <unk> " plough " and <unk> ( <unk> ) " harrow " . 
 = = = Verb system and pronouns = = = 
 The verb systems and pronouns recorded by Baudrimont is peculiar in several ways . Apart from his problem of eliciting the citation form of verbs as opposed to participles , he lists pronouns and possessive pronouns that appear to contain Romani roots and an unexpected auxiliary . 
 The verb <unk> for " to have " attested elsewhere although Basque derived forms appear more common overall . Kalderash Romani employs the 3rd person of " to be " and a dative pronoun to express ownership : 
 <unk> that forms like duk ( 3rd pers @-@ have @-@ 2nd per ( male ) ) are the verbal part whereas Erromintxela tuk is a pronoun . 
 The negative particle na is fairly clear in the forms above . <unk> , as Baudrimont notes , is the word for " much , many " and may not be a true pronoun . Kalderash uses the accusative pronouns to express possession but the forms above are more reminiscent of wrongly parsed Kalderash dative forms <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> etc. and perhaps a different case of " to be " ( the full Kalderash paradigm being sim , san , si , si , sam , san / sen , si ) . 
 On the whole , it raises questions about the level of communication between Baudrimont and his informants and the quality of ( some of the ) material elicited .

 = USS Winnebago ( 1863 ) = 
 USS Winnebago was a double @-@ turret Milwaukee @-@ class river monitor , named for the Winnebago tribe of Siouan Indians , built for the Union Navy during the American Civil War . The ship participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay in 1864 , during which she was lightly damaged , and the bombardments of Forts Gaines and Morgan as Union troops besieged the fortifications defending the bay . In early 1865 , Winnebago again supported Union forces during the Mobile Campaign as they attacked Confederate fortifications defending the city of Mobile , Alabama . She was placed in reserve after the end of the war and sold in 1874 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Winnebago was 229 feet ( 69 @.@ 8 m ) long overall and had a beam of 56 feet ( 17 @.@ 1 m ) . The ship had a depth of hold of 8 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) and a draft of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) . She was 970 tons burthen and displaced 1 @,@ 300 long tons ( 1 @,@ 300 t ) . Her crew numbered 138 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was powered by two 2 @-@ cylinder horizontal non @-@ condensing steam engines , each driving two propellers , using steam generated by seven tubular boilers . The engines were designed to reach a top speed of 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . Chickasaw carried 156 long tons ( 159 t ) of coal . 
 The ship 's main armament consisted of four smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 11 @-@ inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets . Her forward turret was designed by James Eads and her rear turret by John Ericsson . Each gun weighed approximately 16 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 300 kg ) and could fire a 136 @-@ pound ( 61 @.@ 7 kg ) shell up to a range of 3 @,@ 650 yards ( 3 @,@ 340 m ) at an elevation of + 15 ° . 
 The cylindrical turrets were protected by eight layers of wrought iron 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) plates . The sides of the hull consisted of three layers of one @-@ inch plates , backed by 15 inches ( 380 mm ) of pine . The deck was heavily cambered to allow headroom for the crew on such a shallow draft and it consisted of iron plates .75 inches ( 19 mm ) thick . The pilothouse , positioned behind and above the fore turret , was protected by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of armor . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 James Eads was awarded the contracts for all four of the Milwaukee @-@ class ships . He laid down Winnebago at his Union Iron Works Carondelet , St. Louis in 1862 . The first U.S. Navy ship to be named after the Indian tribe , she was launched on 4 July 1863 and commissioned on 27 April 1864 . 
 Initially assigned to the Mississippi River Squadron , Winnebago operated on the Mississippi River defending Union ships against Confederate raids and ambushes for several months . She was transferred to Rear Admiral David Farragut 's West Gulf Blockading Squadron on 9 July , together with her sister Chickasaw . The ship required some time to refit at New Orleans and prepare for the voyage to Mobile across the Gulf of Mexico , so the two sisters did not depart New Orleans until 29 July . On the voyage down the Mississippi to the Pass A Loutre , Chickasaw was forced to anchor overnight because of steering problems and the two ships did not cross the sandbar at the mouth of the pass until the evening of the following day . Once in the Gulf , Winnebago was taken under tow by the sidewheel gunboat Metacomet for the voyage across the Gulf . Farragut inspected the monitor after her arrival and was dismayed to learn that one of her turrets had jammed . He also preferred to have a more experienced officer in command and appointed Commander Thomas H. Stevens , Jr. as her new captain . 
 Farragut 's plan for the battle was relatively simple . The larger , more heavily armed monitors Tecumseh and Manhattan were to keep the ironclad ram CSS Tennessee away from the vulnerable wooden ships while they were passing Fort Morgan and then sink her . Chickasaw and Winnebago were to engage the fort until all of the wooden ships had passed . The four monitors would form the starboard column of ships , closest to Fort Morgan , with Winnebago in the rear , while the wooden ships formed a separate column to port . The eastern side of the channel closest to Fort Morgan was free of obstacles , but " torpedoes " , as mines were called at the time , were known to be present west of a prominent black buoy in the channel . 
 The two Milwaukee @-@ class ships bombarded Fort Morgan for about an hour and a half while the wooden ships passed through the mouth of Mobile Bay ; Winnebago beginning at 07 : 15 even though her forward turret was still jammed in place . About three @-@ quarters of an hour later , Tecumseh struck a " torpedo " and sank rapidly . Winnebago took on board 10 survivors from the ill @-@ fated Tecumseh who had been rescued by a boat from Metacomet under heavy fire and passed Ft . Morgan at 08 : 30 . After Tennessee first attacked Stevens ' former command , the gunboat Oneida , he was able to interpose Winnebago between the two ships in case the Confederate ironclad turned around for another attack , but it disengaged and briefly sought the shelter of Ft . Morgan 's guns . Around 09 : 10 the traversing gear for the rear turret broke down , only five minutes before Winnebago received the order to attack the Tennessee after it had sortied into the middle of Mobile Bay to attack the Union squadron . The monitor was forced to turn the entire ship to bring her guns to bear and did not play a significant part in the second phase of the battle before Tennessee was forced to surrender at 09 : 45 . During the battle , Winnebago was hit 19 times , three of which penetrated the deck near her aft turret , although she suffered no casualties . Despite the problems with her turrets , the ship managed to fire 56 shells , a mixture of solid shot , explosive shells , grapeshot , canister shot , and shrapnel shells . 
 Winnebago intermittently bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines until they surrendered , on 24 and 6 August , respectively . On the night of 8 August , Commander Stevens sent a boat crew under the command of Acting Ensign Michael Murphy on a successful mission to cut the telegraph cable between Fort Morgan and the city of Mobile . The fort surrendered on 24 August and the ship remained at Mobile Bay into 1865 supporting Union forces . On 27 March , Union forces advanced on Spanish Fort as the first step in capturing Mobile . The Navy 's role was to bombard the defenses and to interdict their communications with Mobile , but the defenders had sown mines in great numbers in the waterways . The Navy successfully swept many of these , but could not completely clear the rivers . 
 Winnebago and her sister Milwaukee sailed upriver on 28 March to attack a Confederate transport and forced it to retreat , but Milwaukee struck a mine , in an area previously swept , as they were returning downriver . She remained afloat forward , which permitted her crew to escape without loss . Winnebago later protected a convoy carrying some 13 @,@ 000 troops under Major General Frederick Steele , to Selma and Montgomery , Alabama later in April . By 28 April , the monitor , together with the gunboats USS <unk> and Sebago , was blockading the Confederate ironclad Nashville and the gunboat Morgan up the Tombigbee River , until their surrender . 
 Winnebago was placed in ordinary on the Algiers side of the Mississippi , across from New Orleans , on 27 September . She was renamed twice during that time , first to Tornado on 15 June 1869 and then she resumed her original name on 10 August 1869 . Winnebago was sold at auction on 12 September 1874 .

Follmer was introduced during the last season of the show , as an ex @-@ lover to main character Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) . Follmer was portrayed by British actor , Cary Elwes . 
 Federal Bureau of Investigation Assistant Director Follmer made his first appearance in the ninth season episode " Nothing Important Happened Today " ( 2001 ) . At the start of the season , Follmer was unfriendly towards John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) because of his case against Alvin Kersh , the Deputy Director of the FBI . In time , however , he came to respect him . 
 = = Character arc = = 
 Follmer was an Assistant Director at the FBI . He had a romantic history with Monica Reyes that he briefly brought up while trying to keep her away from the X @-@ files . His true motives were more political in nature and part of his sycophancy to Alvin Kersh . He did not believe in the X @-@ files and deliberately showed disrespect to John Doggett by calling him " Mr. Doggett " instead of " Agent " . 
 In 2002 , new evidence concerning the murder of Luke Doggett came to light . Doggett sought Follmer 's assistance because he had worked against organized crime in New York City before coming to Washington . Reyes , however , recalled seeing Follmer accept a bribe from a mobster . Although he tried to play the event off as him paying an informant ( at which he nearly succeeded ) , the truth was as Reyes suspected : Follmer was crooked . Once the truth of Luke 's fate was revealed , Follmer killed the mobster who had nevertheless threatened blackmail concerning Follmer 's bribe acceptance . Follmer 's future at the FBI was left unresolved , although he most likely faced criminal charges for his actions .

 When creating the character , Chris Carter , one of the executive producers of The X @-@ Files , personally wanted British actor Cary Elwes in the role . Elwes won the role after an audition with Annabeth Gish on August 8 , 2001 . He was chosen because of " the dynamic " and " the energy between the two of them . " Along with announcing the character , he said that the character would only appear in six episodes . 
 When creating the character , Elwes did not want the character to be looked as " good or bad " , even having discussing it with Carter and Frank Spotnitz , another executive producer of the show . The producers and actors have instead labeled him as " ambiguous " , and a man who wants to see " evidence through logic " and not superstition . When describing his character to The Hollywood Reporter , Elwes said he " is a guy who is a little more buttoned up , a little more polished ; he represents a different kind of FBI . " 
 There were two reasons for creating the character of Follmer , the first being when making Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) became a main character in the ninth season , they decided to provide a love interest for the character . When introducing Follmer to the show , they wanted to strengthen John Doggett 's ( Robert Patrick ) and Reyes relationship . The second reason was that they wanted to create a character different from Doggett ; according to John Shiban , they wanted from the start to have a character who was basically " anti @-@ Doggett " .

 John Sellers from Entertainment Weekly reacted overall positive when it was confirmed that Cary Elwes would become a recurring guest actor . Marisa Guthrie from the Boston Herald said Elwes was " fine " as Follmer . Michigan Daily reviewer Christian Smith called the character " unreadable " .

" An unnamed reviewer from Critical Myth felt Follmer 's dialogue in the season premiere , " Nothing Important Happened Today " , especially the scene at the bar did not " make any sense . " While another review from the same site , felt that Follmer 's " characterization " was much " stronger " in " 4 @-@ D " than in the season premiere . 
 = A Ghost Is Born = 
 A Ghost Is Born is the fifth studio album by American alternative rock band Wilco . Released on June 22 , 2004 , it features singer Jeff Tweedy on lead guitar more than any previous Wilco album . The band streamed the album online for free , and offered a five song EP to purchasers . 
 Tweedy entered a rehab clinic shortly before the release of the album , delaying its release by two weeks . It also shortened its promotional tour . Despite this , A Ghost Is Born 's opening week was the best sales week for the band at the time and the album was met with good reviews from major publications such as Rolling Stone and PopMatters . The album earned Wilco a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album . 
 = = Production = = 
 Wilco signed a contract with Nonesuch Records in November 2001 after a lengthy dispute with Reprise Records over the release of the band 's fourth album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot . Foxtrot was welcomed with positive reviews from The Village Voice — where the album was rated by the critics as the best album of 2002 — and Rolling Stone . It sold over 590 @,@ 000 copies , earning a Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 Recording for a new album began in November 2003 under the working title Wilco Happens . The album was produced by Jim O 'Rourke , who mixed Foxtrot and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur . O 'Rourke encouraged lead singer Jeff Tweedy to develop his guitar skills for the album ; Tweedy recently became the lead guitarist for the band due to the dismissal of Jay Bennett after the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot recording sessions . Tweedy sought to play solos on the album that were unlike those of jam bands such as Phish and The Grateful Dead . Instead , he performed composed solos influenced by Television such as the one during the coda of " At Least That 's What You Said " . Tweedy refers to the guitar solo at the end of the track as a " musical transcription " of one of his panic attacks . A Ghost Is Born was recorded in a manner different from Foxtrot or 1999 's Summerteeth ; whereas those recordings were performed live in the studio and then overdubbed , A Ghost Is Born was first performed on Pro Tools and only played live once completed . Tweedy was excited about writing an album this way : 
 An unusual feature of A Ghost Is Born is the fifteen @-@ minute long track " Less Than You Think " . The first part of the song begins as a ballad which references belief systems and atheism which after 3 minutes , fades out . The second part begins at this moment and consists of electronic drones and noise , intended to audibly represent the migraines that lead singer Jeff Tweedy had been suffering from while addicted to pain killers during the recording sessions for A Ghost Is Born . For the song , each band member created a synthesizer noise that mimicked an electronic sound . The installations were simultaneously activated in the room and recorded . The noise , which served as the coda to the song , was remixed to provide dynamics to the track . Calling it " the track that everyone will hate , " Tweedy defended the song 's inclusion on the album : 
 A Ghost Is Born was the first Wilco album with pianist Mikael Jorgensen ; he had previously worked as an engineer with the band on their collaboration with The Minus 5 . Jeff Tweedy provided lead vocals and acted as lead guitarist for the only time since the band formed . John Stirratt , the only original member aside from Tweedy , played bass and guitar . Glenn Kotche and Jim O 'Rourke , Tweedy 's associates from Loose Fur , acted as drummer and multi @-@ instrumentalist , respectively . Leroy Bach played a variety of keyboards as well as bass guitar . All members of the band contributed with a synthesizer part on " Less Than You Think " . 
 = = Marketing and promotion = = 
 Wilco began touring in support of Ghost even before the album had been released . Multi @-@ instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band after the recording sessions to join a theater production , so Wilco added jazz rock guitarist Nels Cline and multi @-@ instrumentalist Pat Sansone to replace him . Sansone had been playing with The Autumn Defense , a side project led by bassist John Stirratt . However , the tour to support the album had to be abridged . In May 2004 , Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago , Illinois due to chronic migraine headaches , anxiety attacks , and clinical depression . In the process of treating the ailments , Tweedy became addicted to prescription painkillers . His rehab led to the cancellation of the European stage of the tour and a delay in the album 's release date . Intended for release on June 8 , 2004 , the album was officially released on June 22 , 2004 . 
 The band also webcast the album in its entirety on the Internet in a promotion with Apple Computer . Nonesuch was willing to allow the MPEG @-@ 4 broadcast due to the success of a similar broadcast in the promotion of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot . Additionally , Wilco offered a free EP to purchasers of the album . The EP featured two outtakes from the album — " Panthers " and " Kicking Television " — and live versions of " At Least That 's What You Said " , " The Late Greats " , and " Handshake Drugs " . The EP was later packaged with the album and sold as a " deluxe version " .

 In its debut week , A Ghost Is Born peaked at # 8 on the Billboard 200 chart and sold over 81 @,@ 000 copies , the highest US chart peak and best sales week ever attained by the band at that time . As of April 13 , 2007 the album has sold over 340 @,@ 000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan . The album was an international hit as well , peaking at # 24 in Norway , # 29 in Sweden , # 33 in New Zealand , # 34 in Belgium , and # 37 in Ireland . 
 Like Foxtrot , A Ghost Is Born was well received by critics . On Metacritic , it has been given a score of 81 out of 100 based on " universal acclaim " . Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone called the album " as eerie as anything Wilco have recorded yet " and applauded " Tweedy offers illuminating curiosity about what can happen in a song . " Stylus Magazine gave it an " A " grade , named it " album of the week " , and claimed it was " even more brilliant " than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot . Michael <unk> of PopMatters also supported the notion that Ghost was better than Foxtrot , calling every note " purposeful " and said that the album made him " surprised and delighted enough to last several lifetimes . " James Hunter from The Village Voice gave it a positive review and said , " Wilco 's ideas are unremarkable , but are worked out with intelligence and striking conception . And as it happens , the new organic emphasis tables some of Wilco 's lamer stylistic obsessions . " Billboard also gave it a positive review and called it Wilco 's " most difficult and uncompromising album to date . " 
 Tiny Mix Tapes gave it all five stars and said that " Unlike the first three Wilco albums and even more than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , A Ghost is Born requires careful listening . " The A.V. Club gave it a favorable review and said that " For the most part , Ghost channels its shaggy sound into pop music . True , it 's pop music that constantly threatens to erupt into noise or fade into silence , but it 's still hard not to hum along . " E ! Online gave the album a B + and said , " If the album weren 't so agreeably off @-@ <unk> , whispery tunes alternate with long , rambling <unk> mix of guitars and piano would almost seem like the stuff you 'd hear on rockers like Layla or Abbey Road . " <unk> gave it eight stars out of ten and stated , " If Foxtrot ' s songs were fractured pop , then Ghost is just plain fracture , a soft and brutal self @-@ examination that pulls no punches even as it manages to remain carefully elliptical . " Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and said , " This time , as well as simply delivering the goods , Wilco come bearing a basket of extras . " Q gave the album four stars out of five and called it " Even more meandering than its celebrated , if somewhat cold , predecessor . It 's also more confident , more coherent , yielding an all @-@ enveloping warmth that 's entirely resistant to any iPod shuffle function . " Flak Magazine also gave it a favorable review and stated : " It 's in the mournful , captivating , meditative , exasperating , pretentious , masterfully constructed experience of A Ghost Is Born that Tweedy and Wilco become true iconoclasts . " The Austin Chronicle gave it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five and said the album was " not a lot of fun . Still , it 's an accomplishment , because it 's an angry album . " 
 Not all publications shared these views about the album . Pitchfork Media , who had given Yankee Hotel Foxtrot a perfect 10 rating , only gave Ghost a 6 @.@ 6 , calling it " wildly uneven " and " less cohesive than any other Wilco release . " Village Voice critic Robert Christgau called the album a " privileged self @-@ indulgence " due to its extreme musical dynamics . Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune gave it an average review and said that " the incomplete quality of " A Ghost is Born " can be quite intriguing , more of a side step than a forward leap , but a worthy experiment all the same . " NME gave the album a score of six out of ten and stated : " It 's like Scissor Sisters on <unk> . With a bit of ELO . And a dash of Ramones . And , with this eclecticism , a worrying lack of focus . " Alternative Press gave it three stars out of five and said , " It 's important that albums like Ghost <unk> unfortunately , those albums don 't always make the most enjoyable listens . " Trouser Press gave it a mixed review and called it " a textbook example of an album created to fulfill expectations the band doesn 't necessarily share . " 
 In 2005 , A Ghost Is Born won two Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package . Although the band was nominated for Grammys for work on previous albums , this was the first time that they won one .

 = Einsatzgruppen = 
 Einsatzgruppen ( German for " task forces " , " deployment groups " ; singular Einsatzgruppe ; official full name Einsatzgruppen der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD ) were Schutzstaffel ( SS ) paramilitary death squads of Nazi Germany that were responsible for mass killings , primarily by shooting , during World War II . The Einsatzgruppen were involved in the murder of much of the intelligentsia and cultural elite of Poland , and had an integral role in the implementation of the so @-@ called " Final Solution to the Jewish question " ( Die Endlösung der Judenfrage ) in territories conquered by Nazi Germany . Almost all of the people they killed were civilians , beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet political commissars , Jews , and Gypsies throughout Eastern Europe . 
 Under the direction of Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler and the supervision of SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich , the Einsatzgruppen operated in territories occupied by the German armed forces following the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and Operation Barbarossa ( the invasion of the Soviet Union ) in June 1941 . The Einsatzgruppen worked hand @-@ in @-@ hand with the Orpo Police Battalions on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from the murder of a few people to operations which lasted over two or more days , such as the massacre at Babi Yar with 33 @,@ 771 Jews killed in two days , and the Rumbula massacre ( with about 25 @,@ 000 killed in two days of shooting ) . As ordered by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler , the Wehrmacht cooperated with the Einsatzgruppen and provided logistical support for their operations . Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related auxiliary troops killed more than two million people , including 1 @.@ 3 million Jews . The total number of Jews murdered during the Holocaust is estimated at 5 @.@ 5 to 6 million people . 
 After the close of World War II , 24 senior leaders of the Einsatzgruppen were prosecuted in the Einsatzgruppen Trial in 1947 – 48 , charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes . Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were handed out . Four additional Einsatzgruppe leaders were later tried and executed by other nations . 
 = = Formation and Action T4 = = 
 The Einsatzgruppen were formed under the direction of SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich and operated by the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) before and during World War II . The Einsatzgruppen had its origins in the ad hoc Einsatzkommando formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the Anschluss in Austria in March 1938 . Originally part of the Sicherheitspolizei ( Security Police ; SiPo ) , two units of Einsatzgruppen were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938 . When military action turned out not to be necessary because of the Munich Agreement , the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents . They also secured government buildings , questioned senior civil servants , and arrested as many as 10 @,@ 000 Czech communists and German citizens . From September 1939 , the Reichssicherheitshauptamt ( Reich Main Security Office ; RSHA ) had overall command of the Einsatzgruppen . 
 As part of the drive to remove undesirable elements from the German population , from September to December 1939 the Einsatzgruppen and others took part in Action T4 , a programme of systematic murder of the physically and mentally handicapped and psychiatric hospital patients undertaken by the Nazi regime . Action T4 mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 , but continued until the end of the war . Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others , but gas chambers were put into use by spring 1940 . 
 = = Invasion of Poland = = 
 In response to Führer und Reichskanzler Adolf Hitler 's plan to invade Poland , Heydrich re @-@ formed the Einsatzgruppen to travel in the wake of the German armies . Membership at this point was drawn from the SS , the Sicherheitsdienst ( Security Service ; SD ) , and the police . Heydrich placed SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Werner Best in command , who chose leaders for the task forces and their subgroups , called Einsatzkommandos , from among educated people with military experience . Some had previously been members of paramilitary groups such as the Freikorps . 
 Numbering some 2 @,@ 700 men at this point , the Einsatzgruppen 's mission was the forceful de @-@ politicisation of the Polish people and the elimination of groups most clearly identified with Polish national identity : the intelligentsia , members of the clergy , teachers , and members of the nobility . As stated by Hitler : " ... there must be no Polish leaders ; where Polish leaders exist they must be killed , however harsh that sounds " . The Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen — lists of people to be killed — had been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939 . The Einsatzgruppen performed these murders with the support of the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz , a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland . Members of the SS , the Wehrmacht , and the Ordnungspolizei ( Order Police ; Orpo ) also shot civilians during the Polish campaign . Approximately 65 @,@ 000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939 . In addition to leaders of Polish society , they killed Jews , prostitutes , Romani people , and the mentally ill . Psychiatric patients in Poland were initially killed by shooting , but by spring 1941 gas vans were widely used . 
 Seven Einsatzgruppen of battalion strength operated in Poland . Each was subdivided into four Einsatzkommandos of company strength . 
 Einsatzgruppe I , commanded by SS @-@ Standartenführer Bruno <unk> , acted with 14th Army 
 Einsatzgruppe II , SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer Emanuel Schäfer , acted with 10th Army 
 Einsatzgruppe III , SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer und <unk> Dr. Herbert Fischer , acted with 8th Army 
 Einsatzgruppe IV , SS @-@ Brigadeführer Lothar Beutel , acted with 4th Army 
 Einsatzgruppe V , SS @-@ <unk> Ernst <unk> , acted with 3rd Army 
 Einsatzgruppe VI , SS @-@ Oberführer Erich Naumann , acted in Wielkopolska 
 Einsatzgruppe VII , SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Udo von <unk> and SS @-@ Gruppenführer Otto Rasch , acted in Upper Silesia and Cieszyn Silesia 
 Though they were formally under the command of the army , the Einsatzgruppen received their orders directly from Heydrich and for the most part acted independently of the army . Many senior army officers were only too glad to leave these genocidal actions to the task forces , as the killings violated the rules of warfare as set down in the Geneva Conventions . However , Hitler had decreed that the army would have to tolerate and even offer logistical support to the Einsatzgruppen when it was tactically possible to do so . Some army commanders complained about unauthorised shootings , looting , and rapes committed by members of the Einsatzgruppen and the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz , to little effect . For example , when Generaloberst Johannes Blaskowitz sent a memorandum of complaint to Hitler about the atrocities , Hitler dismissed his concerns as " childish " , and Blaskowitz was relieved of his post in May 1940 . He continued to serve in the army but never received promotion to field marshal . 
 The final task of the Einsatzgruppen in Poland was to round up the remaining Jews and concentrate them in ghettos within major cities with good railway connections . The intention was to eventually remove all the Jews from Poland , but at this point their final destination had not yet been determined . Together , the Wehrmacht and the Einsatzgruppen also drove tens of thousands of Jews eastward into Soviet @-@ controlled territory . 
 = = Preparations for Operation Barbarossa = = 
 On 13 March 1941 , in the lead @-@ up to Operation Barbarossa , the planned invasion of the Soviet Union , Hitler dictated his " Guidelines in Special Spheres re : Directive No. 21 ( Operation Barbarossa ) " . Sub @-@ paragraph B specified that Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler would be given " special tasks " on direct orders from the Führer , which he would carry out independently . This directive was intended to prevent friction between the Wehrmacht and the SS in the upcoming offensive . Hitler also specified that criminal acts against civilians perpetrated by members of the Wehrmacht during the upcoming campaign would not be prosecuted in the military courts , and thus would go unpunished . 
 In a speech to his leading generals on 30 March 1941 , Hitler described his envisioned war against the Soviet Union . General Franz Halder , the Army 's Chief of Staff , described the speech : 
 Struggle between two ideologies . <unk> evaluation of Bolshevism , equals antisocial criminality . Communism immense future danger ... This a fight to the finish . If we do not accept this , we shall beat the enemy , but in thirty years we shall again confront the Communist foe . We don 't make war to preserve the enemy ... Struggle against Russia : Extermination of Bolshevik Commissars and of the Communist intelligentsia ... Commissars and GPU personnel are criminals and must be treated as such . The struggle will differ from that in the west . In the east harshness now means mildness for the future . 
 Though General Halder did not record any mention of Jews , German historian Andreas Hillgruber argued that because of Hitler 's frequent contemporary statements about the coming war of annihilation against " Judeo @-@ Bolshevism " , his generals would have understood Hitler 's call for the destruction of the Soviet Union as also comprising a call for the destruction of its Jewish population . The genocide was often described using euphemisms such as " special tasks " and " executive measures " ; Einsatzgruppe victims were often described as having been shot while trying to escape . In May 1941 , Heydrich verbally passed on the order to kill the Soviet Jews to the SiPo NCO School in <unk> , where the commanders of the reorganised Einsatzgruppen were being trained for Operation Barbarossa . In spring 1941 , Heydrich and the First Quartermaster of the Wehrmacht Heer , General Eduard Wagner , successfully completed negotiations for co @-@ operation between the Einsatzgruppen and the German Army to allow the implementation of the " special tasks " . Following the Heydrich @-@ Wagner agreement on 28 April 1941 , Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch ordered that when Operation Barbarossa began , all German Army commanders were to immediately identify and register all Jews in occupied areas in the Soviet Union , and fully co @-@ operate with the Einsatzgruppen . 
 In further meetings held in June 1941 Himmler outlined to top SS leaders the regime 's intention to reduce the population of the Soviet Union by 30 million people , not only through direct killing of those considered racially inferior , but by depriving the remainder of food and other necessities of life . 
 = = = Organisation starting in 1941 = = = 
 For Operation Barbarossa , initially four Einsatzgruppen were created , each numbering 500 – 990 men to comprise a total force of 3 @,@ 000 . Einsatzgruppen A , B , and C were to be attached to Army Groups North , Centre , and South ; Einsatzgruppe D was assigned to the 11th Army . The Einsatzgruppe for Special Purposes operated in eastern Poland starting in July 1941 . The Einsatzgruppen were under the control of the RSHA , headed by Heydrich and later by his successor , SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Ernst Kaltenbrunner . Heydrich gave them a mandate to secure the offices and papers of the Soviet state and Communist Party ; to liquidate all the higher cadres of the Soviet state ; and to instigate and encourage pogroms against Jewish populations . The men of the Einsatzgruppen were recruited from the SD , Gestapo , Kriminalpolizei ( Kripo ) , Orpo , and Waffen @-@ SS . Each Einsatzgruppe was under the operational control of the Higher SS Police Chiefs in its area of operations . In May 1941 , General Wagner and SS @-@ Brigadeführer Walter Schellenberg agreed that the Einsatzgruppen in front @-@ line areas were to operate under army command , while the army provided the Einsatzgruppen with all necessary logistical support . 
 Heydrich acted under orders from Reichsführer @-@ SS Himmler , who supplied security forces on an " as needed " basis to the local SS and Police Leaders . Led by SD , Gestapo , and Kripo officers , Einsatzgruppen included recruits from the Orpo , Security Service and Waffen @-@ SS , augmented by uniformed volunteers from the local auxiliary police force . Each Einsatzgruppe was supplemented with a reserve battalion of <unk> and Waffen @-@ SS as well as support personnel such as drivers and radio operators . On average , the Orpo formations were larger and better armed , with heavy machine @-@ gun detachments , which enabled them to carry out operations beyond the capability of the SS . Each death squad followed an assigned army group as they advanced into the Soviet Union . During the course of their operations , the Einsatzgruppen commanders received assistance from the Wehrmacht . Activities ranged from the murder of targeted groups of individuals named on carefully prepared lists , to joint city @-@ wide operations with SS Einsatzgruppen which lasted for two or more days , such as the massacres at Babi Yar , perpetrated by the Orpo Reserve Battalion 45 , and at Rumbula , by Battalion 22 , reinforced by local <unk> ( auxiliary police ) . The SS brigades , wrote historian Christopher Browning , were " only the thin cutting edge of German units that became involved in political and racial mass murder . " 
 Many Einsatzgruppe leaders were highly educated ; for example , nine of seventeen leaders of Einsatzgruppe A held doctorate degrees . Three Einsatzgruppen were commanded by holders of doctorates , one of whom ( SS @-@ Gruppenführer Otto Rasch ) held a double doctorate . 
 Additional Einsatzgruppen were created as additional territory was conquered . Einsatzgruppe E operated in Independent State of Croatia under three commanders , SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Teichmann , SS @-@ Standartenführer Günther Herrmann , and lastly SS @-@ Standartenführer Wilhelm Fuchs . The unit was subdivided into five Einsatzkommandos located in Vinkovci , Sarajevo , Banja Luka , Knin , and Zagreb . Einsatzgruppe F worked with Army Group South . Einsatzgruppe G operated in Romania , Hungary , and Ukraine , commanded by SS @-@ Standartenführer Dr. Josef Kreuzer . Einsatzgruppe H was assigned to Slovakia . Einsatzgruppen K and L , under SS @-@ Oberführer Dr. Emanuel Schäfer and SS @-@ Standartenführer Dr. Ludwig Hahn , worked alongside 5th and 6th Panzer Armies during the Ardennes offensive . Hahn had previously been in command of Einsatzgruppe <unk> in Greece . 
 Other Einsatzgruppen and Einsatzkommandos included Einsatzgruppe Iltis ( operated in Carinthia , on the border between Slovenia and Austria ) under SS @-@ Standartenführer Paul Blobel , Einsatzgruppe <unk> ( Yugoslavia ) Einsatzkommando Luxemburg ( Luxembourg ) , Einsatzgruppe Norwegen ( Norway ) commanded by SS @-@ Oberführer Dr. Franz Walter Stahlecker , Einsatzgruppe Serbien ( Yugoslavia ) under SS @-@ Standartenführer Wilhelm Fuchs and SS @-@ Gruppenführer August <unk> , Einsatzkommando Tilsit ( Lithuania , Poland ) , and Einsatzgruppe Tunis ( Tunis ) , commanded by SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer Walter Rauff . 
 = = Killings in the Soviet Union = = 
 After the invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 , the Einsatzgruppen 's main assignment was to kill civilians , as in Poland , but this time its targets specifically included Soviet Communist Party commissars and Jews . In a letter dated 2 July 1941 Heydrich communicated to his SS and Police Leaders that the Einsatzgruppen were to execute all senior and middle ranking Comintern officials ; all senior and middle ranking members of the central , provincial , and district committees of the Communist Party ; extremist and radical Communist Party members ; people 's commissars ; and Jews in party and government posts . Open @-@ ended instructions were given to execute " other radical elements ( saboteurs , propagandists , snipers , assassins , agitators , etc . ) . " He instructed that any pogroms spontaneously initiated by the occupants of the conquered territories were to be quietly encouraged . 
 On 8 July , Heydrich announced that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans , and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot . On 17 July Heydrich ordered that the Einsatzgruppen were to kill all Jewish Red Army prisoners of war , plus all Red Army prisoners of war from Georgia and Central Asia , as they too might be Jews . Unlike in Germany , where the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 defined as Jewish anyone with at least three Jewish grandparents , the Einsatzgruppen defined as Jewish anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent ; in either case , whether or not the person practised the religion was irrelevant . The unit was also assigned to exterminate Romani people and the mentally ill . It was common practice for the Einsatzgruppen to shoot hostages . 
 As the invasion began , the Germans pursued the fleeing Red Army , leaving a security vacuum . Reports surfaced of Soviet guerrilla activity in the area , with local Jews immediately suspected of collaboration . Heydrich ordered his officers to incite anti @-@ Jewish pogroms in the newly occupied territories . Pogroms , some of which were orchestrated by the Einsatzgruppen , broke out in Latvia , Lithuania , and Ukraine . Within the first few weeks of Operation Barbarossa , 40 pogroms led to the deaths of 10 @,@ 000 Jews , and by the end of 1941 some 60 pogroms had taken place , claiming as many as 24 @,@ 000 victims . However , SS @-@ Brigadeführer Franz Walter Stahlecker , commander of <unk> A , reported to his superiors in mid @-@ October that the residents of Kaunas were not spontaneously starting pogroms , and secret assistance by the Germans was required . A similar reticence was noted by Einsatzgruppe B in Russia and Belarus and Einsatzgruppe C in Ukraine ; the further east the Einsatzgruppen travelled , the less likely the residents were to be prompted into killing their Jewish neighbours . 
 All four main Einsatzgruppen took part in mass shootings from the early days of the war . Initially the targets were adult Jewish men , but by August the net had been widened to include women , children , and the elderly — the entire Jewish population . Initially there was a semblance of legality given to the shootings , with trumped @-@ up charges being read out ( arson , sabotage , black <unk> , or refusal to work , for example ) and victims being killed by a firing squad . As this method proved too slow , the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to , or even inside , mass graves that had been prepared . Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons , with survivors being killed with a pistol shot . 
 As word of the massacres got out , many Jews fled ; in Ukraine , 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away . This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial , as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals . In other areas the invasion was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories . A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews were members of the Bolshevist apparatus , and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would have a negative impact on the economy and the food supply . The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei ( free of Jews ) . Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established to make use of the Jews as slave labour until they were totally eliminated , a goal that was postponed until 1942 . 
 Einsatzgruppen used public hangings as a terror tactic on the local population . An Einsatzgruppe B report , dated 9 October 1941 , described one such hanging . Due to suspected partisan activity near Demidov , all male residents aged 15 to 55 were put in a camp to be screened . The screening produced seventeen people identified as " partisans " and " Communists " . Five members of the group were hanged while 400 local residents were assembled to watch ; the rest were shot . 
 = = = Babi Yar = = = 
 The largest mass shooting perpetrated by the Einsatzgruppen took place on 29 and 30 September 1941 at Babi Yar , a ravine northwest of Kiev , a city in Ukraine that had fallen to the Germans on 19 September . The perpetrators included a company of Waffen @-@ SS attached to Einsatzgruppe C under Rasch , members of Sonderkommando 4a under SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Friedrich Jeckeln , and some Ukrainian auxiliary police . The Jews of Kiev were told to report to a certain street corner on 29 September ; anyone who disobeyed would be shot . Since word of massacres in other areas had not yet reached Kiev and the assembly point was near the train station , they assumed they were being deported . People showed up at the rendezvous point in large numbers , laden with possessions and food for the journey . 
 After being marched two miles north @-@ west of the city centre , the victims encountered a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops . Thirty or forty people at a time were told to leave their possessions and were escorted through a narrow passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs . Anyone who tried to escape was beaten . Soon the victims reached an open area , where they were forced to strip , and then were herded down into the ravine . People were forced to lie down in rows on top of the bodies of other victims , and they were shot in the back of the head or the neck by members of the execution squads . 
 The murders continued for two days , claiming a total of 33 @,@ 771 victims . Sand was shovelled and bulldozed over the bodies and the sides of the ravine were dynamited to bring down more material . Anton <unk> , a member of Sonderkommando 4a , later testified that three days later that there were still people alive among the corpses . <unk> spent the next few days helping smooth out the " millions " of banknotes taken from the victims ' possessions . The clothing was taken away , destined to be re @-@ used by German citizens . Jeckeln 's troops shot more than 100 @,@ 000 Jews by the end of October . 
 = = Killings in the Baltic states = = 
 Einsatzgruppe A operated in the formerly Soviet @-@ occupied Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania . According to its own reports to Himmler , Einsatzgruppe A killed almost 140 @,@ 000 people in the five months following the invasion : 136 @,@ 421 Jews , 1 @,@ 064 Communists , 653 people with mental illnesses , 56 partisans , 44 Poles , five Gypsies , and one Armenian were reported killed between 22 June and 25 November 1941 . 
 Upon entering Kaunas , Lithuania , on 25 June 1941 , the Einsatzgruppe released the criminals from the local jail and encouraged them to join the pogrom which was underway . Between 23 – 27 June 1941 , 4 @,@ 000 Jews were killed on the streets of Kaunas and in nearby open pits and ditches . Particularly active in the Kaunas pogrom was the so @-@ called " Death Dealer of Kaunas " , a young man who murdered Jews with a crowbar at the <unk> Garage before a large crowd that cheered each killing with much applause ; he occasionally paused to play the Lithuanian national anthem " Tautiška giesmė " on his accordion before resuming the killings . 
 As Einsatzgruppe A advanced into Lithuania , it actively recruited local nationalists and antisemitic groups . In July 1941 , members of the <unk> movement joined the massacres . A pogrom in Riga in early July killed 400 Jews . Latvian nationalist <unk> Arājs and his supporters undertook a campaign of arson against synagogues . On 2 July , Einsatzgruppe A commander Stahlecker appointed Arājs to head the <unk> Kommando , a Sonderkommando of about 300 men , mostly university students . Together , Einsatzgruppe A and the Arājs Kommando killed 2 @,@ 300 Jews in Riga on 6 – 7 July . Within six months , Arājs and his men would kill about half of Latvia 's Jewish population . 
 Local officials , the Selbstschutz , and the Hilfspolizei ( Auxiliary Police ) played a key role in rounding up and massacring Jewish Lithuanians , Latvians , and Estonians . These groups helped the Einsatzgruppen and other killing units to quickly identify Jews . The Hilfspolizei , consisting of auxiliary police organised by the Germans and recruited from former Latvian Army and police officers , ex @-@ <unk> , members of the <unk> , and university students , assisted in the murder of Latvia 's Jewish citizens . Similar units were created elsewhere , and provided much of the manpower for the Holocaust in Eastern Europe . 
 With the creation of units such as the Arājs Kommando and the <unk> Hamann in Lithuania , the attacks changed from the spontaneous mob violence of the pogroms to more systematic massacres . With extensive local help , Einsatzgruppe A was the first Einsatzgruppe to attempt to systematically exterminate all the Jews in its area . Latvian historian <unk> <unk> wrote : 
 Of the roughly 83 @,@ 000 Jews who fell into German hands in Latvia , not more than 900 survived ; and of the more than 20 @,@ 000 Western Jews sent into Latvia , only some 800 lived through the deportation until liberation . This was the highest percentage of eradication in all of Europe . 
 In late 1941 , the Einsatzkommandos settled into headquarters in Kovno , Riga , and Tallinn . Einsatzgruppe A grew less mobile and faced problems because of its small size . The Germans relied increasingly on the Arājs Kommando and similar groups to perform massacres of Jews . 
 Such extensive and enthusiastic collaboration with the Einsatzgruppen has been attributed to several factors . Since the Russian Revolution of 1905 , the Kresy <unk> and other borderlands had experienced a political culture of violence . The period of Soviet rule had been profoundly traumatic for residents of the Baltic states and areas that had been part of Poland until 1939 ; the population was brutalised and terrorised by the imposed Soviet rule , and the existing familiar structures of society were destroyed . 
 Historian Erich <unk> notes that many survived and made sense of the " totalitarian atomization " of society by seeking conformity with communism . As a result , by the time of the German invasion in 1941 , many had come to see conformity with a totalitarian regime as socially acceptable behaviour ; thus , people simply transferred their allegiance to the German regime when it arrived . Some who had collaborated with the Soviet regime sought to divert attention from themselves by naming Jews as collaborators and killing them . 
 = = = Rumbula = = = 
 In November 1941 Himmler was dissatisfied with the pace of the exterminations in Latvia , as he intended to move Jews from Germany into the area . He assigned SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Jeckeln , one of the perpetrators of the Babi Yar massacre , to liquidate the Riga ghetto . Jeckeln selected a site about 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) southeast of Riga near the Rumbula railway station , and had 300 Russian prisoners of war prepare the site by digging pits in which to bury the victims . Jeckeln organised around 1 @,@ 700 men , including 300 members of the <unk> Kommando , 50 German SD men , and 50 Latvian guards , most of whom had already participated in mass killings of civilians . These troops were supplemented by Latvians , including members of the Riga city police , battalion police , and ghetto guards . Around 1 @,@ 500 able @-@ bodied Jews would be spared execution so their slave labour could be exploited ; a thousand men were relocated to a fenced @-@ off area within the ghetto and 500 women were temporarily housed in a prison and later moved to a separate nearby ghetto , where they were put to work mending uniforms . 
 Although Rumbula was on the rail line , Jeckeln decided that the victims should travel on foot from Riga to the execution ground . Trucks and buses were arranged to carry children and the elderly . The victims were told that they were being relocated , and were advised to bring up to 20 kilograms ( 44 lb ) of possessions . The first day of executions , 30 November 1941 , began with the perpetrators rousing and assembling the victims at 4 : 00 am . The victims were moved in columns of a thousand people toward the execution ground . As they walked , some SS men went up and down the line , shooting people who could not keep up the pace or who tried to run away or rest . 
 When the columns neared the prepared execution site , the victims were driven some 270 metres ( 300 yd ) from the road into the forest , where any possessions that had not yet been abandoned were seized . Here the victims were split into groups of fifty and taken deeper into the forest , near the pits , where they were ordered to strip . The victims were driven into the prepared trenches , made to lie down , and shot in the head or the back of the neck by members of Jeckeln 's bodyguard . Around 13 @,@ 000 Jews from Riga were killed at the pits that day , along with a thousand Jews from Berlin who had just arrived by train . On the second day of the operation , 8 December 1941 , the remaining 10 @,@ 000 Jews of Riga were killed in the same way . About a thousand were killed on the streets of the city or on the way to the site , bringing the total deaths for the two @-@ day extermination to 25 @,@ 000 people . For his part in organising the massacre , Jeckeln was promoted to Leader of the SS Upper Section , Ostland . 
 = = Second Sweep = = 
 Einsatzgruppe B , C , and D did not immediately follow Einsatzgruppe A 's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas . The Einsatzgruppe commanders , with the exception of Einsatzgruppe A 's Stahlecker , were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 that it was impossible to kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep , and thought the killings should stop . An Einsatzgruppe report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them . Also , in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west . Thus , an interval passed between the first round of Einsatzgruppen massacres in summer and fall , and what American historian Raul Hilberg called the second sweep , which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942 . During the interval , the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos . 
 Einsatzgruppe A had already murdered almost all Jews in its area , so it shifted its operations into Belarus to assist Einsatzgruppe B. In Dnepropetrovsk in February 1942 , Einsatzgruppe D reduced the city 's Jewish population from 30 @,@ 000 to 702 over the course of four days . The German Order Police and local collaborators provided the extra manpower needed to perform all the shootings . <unk> wrote that , as in the Baltic states , the Germans could not have killed so many Jews so quickly without local help . He points out that the ratio of Order Police to auxiliaries was 1 to 10 in both Ukraine and Belarus . In rural areas the proportion was 1 to 20 . This meant that most Ukrainian and Belarusian Jews were killed by fellow Ukrainians and Belarusians commanded by German officers rather than by Germans . 
 The second wave of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed resistance in some areas , though the chance of success was poor . Weapons were typically primitive or home @-@ made . Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities , so there was no way to create a unified strategy . Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents . Mass break @-@ outs were sometimes attempted , though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed . 
 = = Transition to gassing = = 
 After a time , Himmler found that the killing methods used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient : they were costly , demoralising for the troops , and sometimes did not kill the victims quickly enough . Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform . Some of the perpetrators suffered physical and mental health problems , and many turned to drink . As much as possible , the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide . The historian Christian <unk> notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility . Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt . Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators : those who were eager to participate right from the start , those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so , and a significant minority who refused to take part . A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task . Commander of Einsatzgruppe D , SS @-@ Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf , particularly noted this propensity towards excess , and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions . 
 During a visit to Minsk in August 1941 , Himmler witnessed an Einsatzgruppen mass execution first @-@ hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men . By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care . He also decided a transition should be made to gassing the victims , especially the women and children , and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders . Gas vans , which had been used previously to kill mental patients , began to see service by all four main Einsatzgruppen from 1942 . However , the gas vans were not popular with the Einsatzkommandos , because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal . Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma . Some of the early mass killings at extermination camps used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines , similar to the method used in gas vans , but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at Auschwitz using Zyklon B , a cyanide @-@ based pesticide gas . 
 Plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe — eleven million people — were formalised at the Wannsee Conference , held on 20 January 1942 . Some would be worked to death , and the rest would be killed in the implementation of the Final Solution of the Jewish question ( German : Die Endlösung der Judenfrage ) . Permanent killing centres at Auschwitz , Belzec , Sobibor , Treblinka , and other Nazi extermination camps replaced mobile death squads as the primary method of mass killing . The Einsatzgruppen remained active , however , and were put to work fighting partisans , particularly in Belarus . 
 After the fall of Stalingrad in February 1943 , Himmler realised that Germany would likely lose the war , and ordered the formation of a special task force , Sonderkommando 1005 , under SS @-@ Standartenführer Paul Blobel . The unit 's assignment was to visit mass graves all along the Eastern Front to exhume bodies and burn them in an attempt to cover up the genocide . The task remained unfinished at the end of the war , and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated . 
 By 1944 the Red Army had begun to push the German forces out of Eastern Europe , and the Einsatzgruppen retreated alongside the Wehrmacht . By late 1944 , most Einsatzgruppen personnel had been folded into Waffen @-@ SS combat units or transferred to permanent death camps . Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related agencies killed more than two million people , including 1 @.@ 3 million Jews . The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5 @.@ 5 to six million people .

 According to research by German historians Klaus @-@ Michael <unk> and Martin <unk> , an Einsatzgruppe was created in 1942 to kill the half @-@ million Jews living in the British Mandate of Palestine and the 50 @,@ 000 Jews of Egypt . Einsatzgruppe Egypt , standing by in Athens , was prepared to go to Palestine once German forces arrived there . SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer Walter Rauff was to lead the unit . Given its small staff of only 24 men , Einsatzgruppe Egypt would have needed help from local residents and from the Afrika Korps to complete their assignment . Its members planned to enlist collaborators from the local population to perform the killings under German leadership . Former Iraqi prime minister Rashid Ali al @-@ Gaylani and the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al @-@ Husseini played roles , engaging in antisemitic radio propaganda , preparing to recruit volunteers , and in raising an Arab @-@ German Battalion that would also follow Einsatzgruppe Egypt to the Middle East . Commander of the Afrika Korps Field Marshal Erwin Rommel promised the co @-@ operation of his corps in these assignments . In an agreement signed in July 1942 between the two groups , Rommel promised logistical support for Einsatzgruppe Egypt , which was to serve under command of the Wehrmacht . The group never left Greece , however ; the plans were set aside after the Allied victory at the Battle of El Alamein . 
 Had Operation Sea Lion , the German plan for an invasion of the United Kingdom been launched , six Einsatzgruppen were scheduled to follow the invasion force into Britain . They were provided with a list called die <unk> , G.B. ( " Special Search List , <unk> " ) , known as The Black Book after the war , of 2 @,@ 300 people to be immediately imprisoned by the Gestapo . The list included Churchill , members of the cabinet , prominent journalists and authors , and members of the Czechoslovak government @-@ in @-@ exile . 
 = = Jäger Report = = 
 The Einsatzgruppen kept official records of many of their massacres and provided detailed reports to their superiors . The Jäger Report , filed by Commander SS @-@ Standartenführer Karl Jäger on 1 December 1941 to his superior , Stahlecker ( head of Einsatzgruppe A ) , covers the activities of Einsatzkommando III in Lithuania over the five @-@ month period from 2 July 1941 to 25 November 1941 . 
 Jäger 's report provides an almost daily running total of the <unk> of 137 @,@ 346 people , the vast majority of them Jews . The report documents the exact date and place of massacres , the number of victims , and their breakdown into categories ( Jews , Communists , criminals , and so on ) . Women were shot from the very beginning , but initially in fewer numbers than men . Children were first included in the tally starting in mid @-@ August , when 3 @,@ 207 people were murdered in <unk> on 15 – 16 August 1941 . For the most part the report does not give any military justification for the killings ; people were killed solely because they were Jews . In total , the report lists over 100 executions in 71 different locations . Jäger wrote : " I can state today that the goal of solving the Jewish problem in Lithuania has been reached by Einsatzkommando 3 . There are no more Jews in Lithuania , apart from working Jews and their families . " In a February 1942 addendum to the report , Jäger increased the total number of victims to 138 @,@ 272 , giving a breakdown of 48 @,@ 252 men , 55 @,@ 556 women , and 34 @,@ 464 children . Only 1 @,@ 851 of the victims were non @-@ Jewish . 
 Jäger escaped capture by the Allies when the war ended . He lived in Heidelberg under his own name until his report was discovered in March 1959 . Arrested and charged , Jäger committed suicide on 22 June 1959 in a <unk> prison while awaiting trial for his crimes . 
 = = Involvement of the Wehrmacht = = 
 The killings took place with the knowledge and support of the German Army in the east . On 10 October 1941 Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau drafted an order to be read to the German Sixth Army on the Eastern Front . Now known as the Severity Order , it read in part : 
 The most important objective of this campaign against the Jewish @-@ Bolshevik system is the complete destruction of its sources of power and the extermination of the Asiatic influence in European civilization ... In this eastern theatre , the soldier is not only a man fighting in accordance with the rules of the art of war , but also the ruthless standard bearer of a national conception ... For this reason the soldier must learn fully to appreciate the necessity for the severe but just retribution that must be meted out to the subhuman species of Jewry . 
 Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt of Army Group South expressed his " complete agreement " with the order . He sent out a circular to the generals under his command urging them to release their own versions and to impress upon their troops the need to exterminate the Jews . General Erich von Manstein , in an order to his troops on 20 November , stated that " the Jewish @-@ Bolshevist system must be exterminated once and for all . " Manstein sent a letter to Einsatzgruppe D commanding officer Ohlendorf complaining that it was unfair that the SS was keeping all of the murdered Jews ' wristwatches for themselves instead of sharing with the army . 
 Beyond this trivial complaint , the Army and the Einsatzgruppen worked closely and effectively . On 6 July 1941 Einsatzkommando 4b of Einsatzgruppe C reported that " Armed forces surprisingly welcome hostility against the Jews " . On 8 September , Einsatzgruppe D reported that relations with the German Army were " excellent " . In the same month , Stahlecker of Einsatzgruppe A wrote that Army Group North had been exemplary in co @-@ operating with the exterminations and that relations with the 4th Panzer Army , commanded by General Erich Hoepner , were " very close , almost cordial " . In the south , the Romanian Army worked closely with Einsatzgruppe D to massacre Ukrainian Jews , killing around 26 @,@ 000 Jews in the Odessa massacre . The German historian Peter Longerich thinks it probable that the Wehrmacht , along with the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists ( <unk> ) , incited the Lviv pogroms , during which 8 @,@ 500 to 9 @,@ 000 Jews were killed by the native population and Einsatzgruppe C in July 1941 . Moreover , most people on the home front in Germany had some idea of the massacres being committed by the Einsatzgruppen . British historian Hugh Trevor @-@ Roper noted that although Himmler had forbidden photographs of the killings , it was common for both the men of the Einsatzgruppen and for bystanders to take pictures to send to their loved ones , which he felt suggested widespread approval of the massacres . 
 The Wehrmacht tried to justify their considerable involvement in the Einsatzgruppen massacres as being anti @-@ partisan operations rather than racist attacks , but Hillgruber wrote that this was just an excuse . He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti @-@ partisan response were lying , and maintained that the slaughter of about 2 @.@ 2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified . 
 = = Einsatzgruppen Trial = = 
 After the close of the World War II , 24 senior leaders of the Einsatzgruppen were prosecuted in the Einsatzgruppen Trial in 1947 – 48 , part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials held under United States military authority . The men were charged with crimes against humanity , war crimes , and membership in the SS ( which had been declared a criminal organization ) . Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were among the judgments ; only four executions were carried out , on 7 June 1951 ; the rest were reduced to lesser sentences . Four additional Einsatzgruppe leaders were later tried and executed by other nations . 
 Several Einsatzgruppen leaders , including Ohlendorf , claimed at the trial to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews . To date no evidence has been found that such an order was ever issued . German prosecutor Alfred <unk> noted that if such an order had been given , post @-@ war courts would only have been able to convict the Einsatzgruppen leaders as accomplices to mass murder . However , if it could be established that the Einsatzgruppen had committed mass murder without orders , then they could have been convicted as perpetrators of mass murder , and hence could have received stiffer sentences , including capital punishment . 
 <unk> postulated that the existence of an early comprehensive order was a fabrication created for use in Ohlendorf 's defence . This theory is now widely accepted by historians . Longerich notes that most orders received by the Einsatzgruppen leaders — especially when they were being ordered to carry out criminal activities — were vague , and couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime . Leaders were given briefings about the need to be " severe " and " firm " ; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly . British historian Sir Ian Kershaw argues that Hitler 's apocalyptic remarks before Barbarossa about the necessity for a war without mercy to " annihilate " the forces of " Judeo @-@ Bolshevism " were interpreted by Einsatzgruppen commanders as permission and encouragement to engage in extreme antisemitic violence , with each Einsatzgruppen commander to use his own discretion about how far he was prepared to go . 
 Most of the perpetrators of Nazi war crimes were never charged , and returned unremarked to civilian life . The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes . And as time went on , it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions ; witnesses grew older and were less likely to be able to offer valuable testimony . Funding for trials was inadequate , and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events , preferring to forget the Nazi past .

 = Action of 10 February 1809 = 
 The Action of 10 February 1809 was a minor naval engagement of the Napoleonic Wars , in which a British Royal Navy squadron chased and captured the French frigate Junon in the Caribbean Sea . Junon was on a mission to carry trade goods from the Îles des Saintes near Guadeloupe back to France and was part of a succession of French warships sent during 1808 and the early months of 1809 in an effort to break the British blockade of the French Caribbean , which was destroying the economies and morale of the islands . Having landed supplies , Junon 's return cargo was intended to improve the economic situation on Guadeloupe with much needed oceanic trade . 
 The patrolling British warships first sighted Junon in the Virgin Islands on 8 February . They then chased her north into the Atlantic Ocean for two days until the frigates HMS Horatio and HMS Latona were able to bring her to action . In a bitterly contested running engagement , Junon was badly damaged and suffered heavy casualties before surrendering to the numerically superior British force . She was later commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name and remained in the Caribbean . Less than a year after her capture , a French convoy to Guadeloupe recaptured and destroyed Junon ; the British subsequently intercepted and defeated the convoy in turn . 
 = = Background = = 
 By 1809 , the Napoleonic Wars were six years old and the British Royal Navy was dominant at sea . <unk> in their home ports by British squadrons , French warships , merchant ships and transports were unable to sail and , as a result , the French colonies in the West Indies were largely cut off from France . These colonies were also closely blockaded themselves and , as a result , their ability to trade independently was severely curtailed , resulting in economic collapse , severe food shortages and social unrest . Messages warning of the deteriorating situation in the colonies had been sent during the summer of 1808 , particularly from the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe . In response supplies had been sent from France in small convoys and individual frigates in the autumn . The British blockading ships had also intercepted the communications from the island , and relayed the information to the Admiralty in London , who had ordered Vice @-@ Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane to assemble a force and invade the French colonies before reinforcements and supplies could reach them . 
 The majority of the French attempts to reach the Caribbean ended in failure . Several ships were intercepted in the Bay of Biscay , while others reached the Caribbean , only to be defeated by ships from Cochrane 's squadron , which was focused on preparations for the invasion of Martinique , planned for February . Only two ships reached the islands safely , the 40 – gun frigates Junon at Guadeloupe and Amphitrite at Martinique . By February 1809 , Martinique was under attack , distracting most of the available British ships from the blockade of Guadeloupe . Taking advantage of the temporary absence of enemy shipping , Junon slipped out of the Îles des Saintes to the south of Guadeloupe on 4 February and sailed north . The French captain , Jean @-@ Baptiste @-@ Augustin Rousseau , had dropped off his military and food supplies and taken on board large quantities of trade goods for sale in France in an effort to revive the Guadeloupe economy . 
 = = Battle = = 
 At 14 : 00 on 8 February , four days after leaving the Îles des Saintes , Junon was spotted passing close to the Virgin Islands by the small British brigs HMS Superieure and HMS Asp , who signalled the approaching ship to halt and prepare for boarding . Ignoring the orders from the smaller ships , Rousseau continued northwards , passing through the Virgin Islands closely followed by Superieure , although Asp was unable to keep up and fell far behind during the night . At 08 : 00 on the morning of 9 February , with Virgin Gorda northwest , Superieure was close enough to open fire , a few long range shots failing to damage the large frigate , which responded with an ineffective broadside . The gunfire attracted other ships , and during the afternoon Superieure was joined by the British frigate HMS Latona , under Captain Hugh Pigot . 
 The chase continued through a second night , the French frigate making significant gains over her pursuers but still unable to escape them completely . At 10 : 30 on 10 February , two sails appeared in the southeast , set on a course that would cut in front of the French frigate . These were the British frigate HMS Horatio under Captain George Scott and the brig HMS Driver . With enemies on all sides , Rousseau recognised that his only hope of escape lay in defeating Horatio : a swift victory would enable him to outrun pursuit from the east , travelling westwards into the Atlantic . Rapidly closing with the new arrivals , Junon opened fire at 12 : 36 . Horatio immediately responded and then circled the slower French vessel and raked her before Rousseau could respond . Drawing close , the frigates exchanged broadsides at point blank range for 40 minutes . The heavier weight of the French ship soon told , with Scott and his first lieutenant severely wounded and their masts badly damaged . Unable to keep up with the French frigate , whose hull was badly holed but whose masts were only lightly damaged , Horatio fell back . 
 Rousseau had also been badly wounded in the exchange , and command of Junon passed to Lieutenant Jean @-@ Léon Emeric , who attempted to pull away from his battered adversary . As he did so the small brig Driver was well placed to intervene , but her captain , Charles Claridge , failed to engage the larger frigate , even though Latona was now rapidly approaching from the west and together they could have outnumbered and outmanoeuvred Junon . Superieure was also close by , and her captain , William Ferrie , did approach the larger French ship , his fire causing enough damage to Junon 's sails to prevent her escape . Taking Horatio in tow at 14 : 24 , the brig kept Scott 's frigate in the chase until sufficient repairs were complete . By 14 : 40 Horatio was again sailing independently and Driver finally came close enough to open fire , although at extreme range : Claridge refused to sail any closer to Junon , despite urgent signals from Horatio and Superieure . At 15 : 04 , Superieure was again close enough to the French ship to open fire and at 15 : 25 Latona arrived , her presence finally convincing Claridge to enter the action . Surrounded by enemy ships and his sails in tatters , Emeric made one last effort to escape to the north , the strain of this manoeuvre causing his main and mizen masts to collapse . With both flight and resistance impossible , Junon surrendered at 15 : 40 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Officers from Latona were first to board the French frigate but Emeric refused to tender his formal surrender except to an officer of Horatio because he insisted that Horatio had caused the entirety of Junon 's damage . British historians have debated this opinion : William James agreed with this assessment , but also opined that if Horatio had been alone it would have been Scott surrendering rather than the French officers , such was the damage his ship had suffered in the battle . Edward Pelham Brenton , who was a serving officer in the Caribbean at the time , gives most of the credit for the victory to Latona , in a detailed account that James later criticised for its inaccuracies . 
 The battered Junon was taken in tow to Halifax , Nova Scotia , where she was repaired and later commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name . The prisoners were also landed in Nova Scotia , including Rousseau , who died from his wounds soon afterwards . The French lost approximately 130 casualties ; British losses were seven killed and 26 wounded on Horatio , six wounded on Latona and one man wounded on Driver . 
 The British commanders and crews were praised for their actions in the battle , with the exception of Claridge in Driver . Both James and Brenton in their later histories heavily criticised his noted reluctance to engage the enemy . By contrast William Ferrie , commander of Superieure was commended for maintaining combat with the much larger frigate whenever possible . Four decades later , in 1847 , the Admiralty recognized the battle with the clasps " Horatio 10 <unk> . 1809 " and " Superieure 10 <unk> . 1809 " to the Naval General Service Medal , which it awarded upon application to all British participants then still living . 
 In the month following the capture of Junon , Guadeloupe was the only French colony in the Caribbean not under attack ; Martinique fell to the British on 24 February and Spanish forces continued their Siege of Santo Domingo . The French did make further attempts to resupply the islands ; a major expedition was defeated off Guadeloupe in April , and elements of this force that reached the island were defeated and captured during June and July . With British forces distracted by the ongoing Reconquista in Santo Domingo , the focus of the campaign moved north , and it was not until a second major expedition arrived in December that significant British forces returned to the Leeward Islands for the final invasion of Guadeloupe . The influx of British reinforcements was too late for HMS Junon ; on 13 December she had been cruising alone to the east of Antigua and been surprised by François Roquebert 's squadron of four French frigates . Outnumbered and surrounded , Junon fought hard but was eventually forced to surrender after Captain John Shortland was mortally wounded . Reduced to a sinking condition in the engagement , Junon was set on fire and abandoned by Roquebert , whose ships were intercepted five days later off Guadeloupe and defeated : two were destroyed and two others returned to France without landing their supplies . 
 = 69 Squadron ( Israel ) = 
 The 69 " Hammers " Squadron is an Israeli Air Force squadron operating the F @-@ <unk> Thunder out of Hatzerim . It was formed in July 1948 to operate three B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses which the fledgling Israeli Air Force had acquired in the United States . The squadron flew the Flying Fortress , a type credited with propelling the IAF into the realm of modern aerial warfare , during both the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War and 1956 Suez Crisis . Disbanded in early 1957 , 69 Squadron reformed in 1969 to fly the F @-@ 4 Phantom II . 69 Squadron operated the Kurnass ( Sledgehammer ) , as the Phantom was known in Israel , for 25 years and its Phantoms saw extensive action during the War of Attrition , Yom Kippur War , First Lebanon War and numerous engagements in between . The squadron often played a central role in IAF suppression of enemy air defences ( SEAD ) efforts and took part in repeated battles against Egyptian and Syrian air defence arrays . 
 The squadron retired its Phantoms in 1994 but reformed shortly thereafter to operate the F @-@ <unk> Thunder . Described as the " long @-@ range , heavy bombing element of Israeli air power " , 69 Squadron is reputed to have carried out Operation Orchard , the 6 September 2007 airstrike on a nuclear site in Syria .

 In early 1948 , with the upcoming end of the British Mandate for Palestine and the looming confrontation with Israel 's Arab neighbors , the leadership of the Yishuv embarked on a worldwide effort to purchase weapons . Despite an American arms embargo , Israeli acquisition agents managed to purchase four commercial B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses in the US . Assembled in Miami , the first two departed the city on June 12 , followed a day later by a third , and made their way first to Puerto Rico and then across the Atlantic via the Azores to Žatec , Czechoslovakia , where they arrived on June 14 . By June 16 the story had made it to the press and the fourth plane , whose crew only barely managed to elude the FBI , was impounded in the Azores by Portuguese authorities . At Žatec the three B @-@ 17s , missing bomb shackles and sights , oxygen systems and defensive weapons , were militarized and the squadron that was to operate them , at the time referred to as the " Hammers Program " , first took shape . Ray Kurtz , a former B @-@ 17 navigator with 31 missions over Europe , was assigned command of the squadron , staffed by an international crew of World War II veterans who volunteered to fight for Israel . Robert Luttrell , a sailor by trade , flying as a bombardier , recalled that for each mission the B @-@ 17s were given new markings and their armament was altered to lead the enemy to believe Israel possessed an entire squadron of the type . 
 On July 15 , 1948 , with fighting raging in Israel and Tel Aviv suffering from Royal Egyptian Air Force ( REAF ) raids , the three B @-@ 17s departed Žatec for Israel . Still ill @-@ equipped , the bombers were nevertheless tasked with bombing Egyptian targets en route . Flying south along the Adriatic , near Crete the bombers separated with Bill Katz and Ray Kurtz taking the only Fortress with an oxygen system and a proper sight to bomb the royal palace in Cairo , and the other two B @-@ 17s heading towards the REAF base at El @-@ Arish . While Katz and Kurtz successfully bombed the <unk> Palace , the other two failed to locate their target and bombed Rafah instead , and all landed that evening at Tel Nof . The three aircraft were back in action at 06 : 30 on the very next day , hitting the REAF base at El @-@ Arish they had missed the previous night . As Tel @-@ Nof was deemed vulnerable to Egyptian attacks , the aircraft then landed at Ramat David , which was to house the squadron for the remainder of the war . In following days , until a UN @-@ brokered ceasefire came into effect on July 18 , the Fortresses struck across three fronts , attacking Majdal , Damascus and Tulkarm . Raising the average bomb load of an IAF sortie from 100 kg per sortie to 743 kg per sortie , the B @-@ 17s are credited with propelling the Israeli Air Force into the realm of modern aerial warfare . 
 Save for a single mission by all three bombers in support of Operation <unk> on July 20 , combat operations ceased until October 1948 . These three months saw the unit reorganize and by August it had received its official designation as 69 Squadron . With Bill Katz now in command , the squadron spent the truce training , qualifying new airmen and equipping the veteran aircraft . Fighting resumed on October 15 with Operation Yoav , aimed with breaking the Egyptian siege of the Negev . Over the next week the Hammers flew 47 sorties against Egyptian targets in and around Majdal , Gaza , El Arish , Al @-@ Faluja , and Rafah . Missions were flown in either a trio or a pair to maximize defensive firepower , and sometimes with 101 Squadron escorts , but no enemy fighters were ever encountered . In late October a number of sorties were also flown against <unk> , in the Upper Galilee , in support of Operation Hiram against Fawzi al @-@ Qawuqji 's Arab Liberation Army . 
 Operation Yoav had left Faluja as an enclave within Israeli @-@ held territory and during November 1948 the Hammers routinely returned to bomb what became known as the Faluja Pocket . The town would nonetheless hold out until the end of the war . On December 22 Israel launched Operation Horev , its last major offensive of the war , to finally defeat the Egyptian expeditionary force and expel it beyond the borders of Mandatory Palestine . 69 Squadron once again flew in support of Israeli efforts in the south , targeting the air base at El @-@ Arish , Khan Younis , Gaza and Rafah . The squadron also revisited Faluja to prevent an Egyptian sortie from the beleaguered pocket , and on New Year 's Day 1949 flew a failed attempt to bomb an Egyptian Navy flotilla which had shelled Tel Aviv . 69 Squadron flew its last missions of the war in the early morning of January 7 , 1949 , against Rafah . Having evaded Egyptian flak on most occasions , both participating bombers were hit , rendering one unserviceable . 
 = = = Postwar deactivation = = = 
 With the end of the 1948 Arab Israeli War , the majority of volunteer airmen returned home , and 69 Squadron once again went through a period of reorganization . From an English @-@ speaking outfit it was transformed into a Hebrew speaking unit . Training was stepped up to qualify Israelis to take over vacated positions and the squadron settled into a peacetime routine , with the B @-@ 17s conducting bombing and cloud seeding tests and participating in IDF exercises . The IAF itself was undergoing major changes , and in early May 1949 69 Squadron relocated to Tel Nof . In October 1951 the squadron moved once more , this time to Hatzor . In December 1952 the three B @-@ 17 was joined by three PBY Catalinas , acquired to guarantee supply to the town of Eilat at Israel 's southern extremity . Utilization of these aircraft , however , was low and they were soon withdrawn from service with the squadron . Spares , meanwhile , were also hampering B @-@ 17 operations and in March 1954 69 Squadron was deactivated and its <unk> handed over to 103 Squadron , which soon retired the Catalinas but continued to operate the three B @-@ 17s . 
 = = = Suez Crisis = = = 
 In 1956 growing diplomatic tensions in the Middle East , tensions that would soon culminate in the Suez Crisis , resulted in the resurrection of 69 Squadron . On April 19 the IAF issued an order reactivating the squadron at Ramat David , with Nahum Efrat as its commanding officer . The squadron was soon tasked with its first mission , allocating two B @-@ 17s for search and rescue operations during Dassault Mystère delivery flights from France to Israel . The reformed squadron once again began training personnel and equipping the aircraft for possible hostilities . As Israel purchased more jet fighters , however , room had to be made for the new arrivals , and in September 1956 the IAF ordered the squadron to send its aircraft into storage and changed its status to reserve . By October 3 the aircraft had been stored at Bedek Aviation ( later Israeli Aircraft Industries ) at Lod , but only three weeks later , on October 25 , the IAF activated the squadron once more . 
 Only two Fortresses had left Bedek 's storage facility by the time hostilities commenced on October 29 , 1956 . The squadron had not flown a single training sortie before fighting began and had only two full crews ready for battle . Israeli piston @-@ engined aircraft flew few missions in the first two days of the war , but on October 31 , 69 Squadron received an order to bomb Rafah in support of IDF Brigade 27 operations . Arriving over the target early on November 1 , the aircraft could not tell the location of friendly troops and without being able to communicate with the forces on the ground , were forced to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean . The B @-@ 17s were back in action the following night , to attack retreating Egyptian forces . A repeat of the previous night 's lack of communications with Israeli forces operating in the same area once again prevented the strike , and the bombers dropped their loads on the outskirts of Gaza . With the threat of Egyptian air power curtailed by Anglo @-@ French strikes against Egyptian air bases , the B @-@ 17s began flying daylight operations . On November 2 the squadron supported the Israeli push towards Sharm el Sheikh , on the southern tip of the Sinai . Two aircraft bombed the local barracks but were met with effective anti @-@ aircraft fire which damaged the lead aircraft . The damaged aircraft managed to return to Ramat David , just as the third B @-@ 17 returned from storage at Bedek . Two aircraft were therefore available for the B @-@ 17s ' final combat sorties with the IAF , another failed strike on Sharm el Sheikh on November 4 . 
 The squadron had flown a total of 8 sorties throughout the war and dropped 27 tons of bombs . With the conclusion of hostilities the squadron continued training and on November 10 even moved once more to Tel Nof . The B @-@ 17s flew a few more sorties during a January 1957 survey of the Sinai but were soon sent back to storage . 69 Squadron was finally disbanded on March 1 , 1957 . It was initially slated to operate the IAF 's next heavy bomber , the Sud @-@ Ouest Vautour , but these plans were dropped in favour of 110 Squadron .

 69 Squadron was reactivated at Ramat David on November 1 , 1969 , headed by Major Avihu Ben @-@ Nun . A year earlier Israel had ordered 50 F @-@ 4 Phantoms , enough to equip two squadrons , and ten IAF airmen had spent March to August 1969 training with the 479th Tactical Training Wing at George Air Force Base . These included five 69 Squadron airmen : Ben @-@ Nun , Ehud Hankin , Rami Harpaz , Shaul Levi and <unk> Eyal . Upon their return to Israel , then in the midst of the War of Attrition , the 69 Squadron airmen flew both training and combat missions with 201 Squadron , the IAF 's first Kurnass squadron . On one such mission on November 11 , Hankin and Eyal shot down an Egyptian MiG @-@ 21 to score the Phantom 's first aerial victory with the IAF . 
 69 Squadron finally received its first four aircraft on November 15 , the third Peace Echo I batch to arrive in Israel . Although still far from the 12 aircraft required to achieve IAF <unk> certification , on November 25 , 1969 , Avihu Ben @-@ Nun led the squadron 's debut operational mission , a combat air patrol ( CAP ) . The first air @-@ to @-@ ground mission came three days later , when two Phantoms struck an Egyptian SA @-@ 2 battery near <unk> . Still busy forming , receiving new aircraft , training and qualifying fresh airmen , the squadron was soon taking an increasingly large part in the IAF 's ongoing battles against Egyptian air defences along the Suez Canal . When the IAF launched Operation <unk> ( <unk> ) against targets in the Egyptian heartland during January 1970 , 69 Squadron was at the forefront of the fighting , and on February 8 , 1970 pilot Aviem Sella and navigator Shabtai Ben @-@ <unk> downed an Egyptian Air Force MiG @-@ 21 . Operations , meanwhile , were also conducted to deter Syria from <unk> the fight , with Phantoms conducting low level runs over Damascus on January 6 , 1970 , and over 5 major Syrian cities on January 29 . The squadron nevertheless suffered its first combat loss on April 2 , when Gideon Magen and Pinchas <unk> were shot down by a Syrian MiG @-@ 21 to become prisoners of war . 
 Israeli aerial supremacy prompted Egypt to turn to the USSR for assistance and by the spring of 1970 an entire Soviet air defence division had deployed to Egypt . The Soviet presence spelled the end of <unk> and Egypt regained the initiative , rolling its air defence array towards the Suez Canal . The IAF sought to hamper these advances through a renewed SEAD campaign and 69 Squadron saw repeated action against Egyptian air defences and related infrastructure . Egyptian SAMs , however , soon exacted their toll on the attackers , with Rami Harpaz and <unk> Eyal falling into Egyptian captivity on June 30 , a fate shared by Amos Zamir and Amos <unk> on July 5 . AN / ALQ @-@ 71 Electronic countermeasures ( ECM ) pods were soon rushed to Israel but proved only partially effective against surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles . On July 18 , the IAF attempted to fly eight F @-@ 4 Phantoms in close @-@ knit pod formations thought to maximize the effect of the ECM pods , only to lose 201 Squadron leader Shmuel Hetz , while an injured Avihu Ben @-@ nun was forced to crash land his badly damaged aircraft at <unk> . 
 The SEAD campaign was halted , but although the IAF possessed no operational answer to the massive air defence array forming west of the Canal , it nevertheless still enjoyed supremacy in the air @-@ ro @-@ air arena . On July 30 , 69 Squadron took part in Operation Rimon 20 , a ruse designed to draw Soviet @-@ flown MiG @-@ 21s into battle . In the ensuing dogfight , five Soviet fighters were downed , of which one was shot down by Avihu Ben @-@ Nun with Shaul Levi and another by Aviem Sella with Reuven Reshef . With no side securing a clear advantage , yet both able to claim military achievements , American pressure soon bore fruit and a ceasefire marking the end of the war came into effect on August 7 , 1970 . 
 = = = Reconnaissance = = = 
 With the next round of the Arab @-@ Israeli conflict deemed a mere matter of time , peacetime saw 69 Squadron engaged in developing new SEAD tactics and weapons and in renewed reconnaissance efforts . New weapons such as the AGM @-@ 45 Shrike and AGM @-@ 12 Bullpup were introduced for the SEAD role , and on September 18 , 1971 , the Hammers flew their first Shrike strike against an Egyptian SA @-@ 2 battery following the downing of an Israeli C @-@ 97 <unk> . As for reconnaissance , the IAF had ordered the RF @-@ 4E reconnaissance variant of the Phantom , but these were not slated for delivery until 1971 . 69 Squadron had already modified two F @-@ 4s in early 1970 for the role by removing their cannons and replacing them with cameras , and after the ceasefire these were joined by a pair of loaned American RF @-@ 4Cs , which were in operation until the squadron received two RF @-@ 4Es in early 1971 . While 119 Squadron , which had transitioned to the F @-@ 4 in 1970 , specialized in high @-@ altitude photography , 69 Squadron adopted low @-@ altitude photography . A mission by reconnaissance Phantoms over northern Syria on September 13 , 1973 , triggered a large scale clash between the two air forces , resulting in the downing of 13 Syrian MiGs ( one at the hands of 69 Squadron 's Amnon Arad ) and the loss of a single Israeli Mirage III . 
 = = = Yom Kippur War = = = 
 Experienced and well @-@ trained , 69 Squadron nevertheless entered the Yom Kippur War unready for the challenges brought about by start of the war . Prior to the outbreak of war , the IAF had been preparing for a pre @-@ emptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian positions , but this was rejected by the Israeli government . 69 Squadron aircraft were in the process of re @-@ armament to the air @-@ to @-@ air role when hostilities began at 14 : 00 on October 6 , 1973 . The aircraft were scrambled to perform <unk> , some having to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean , yet no aerial opposition was encountered . The squadron flew 37 sorties on the first day of the war , of which only 4 were strike missions , while two aircraft suffered damage from SA @-@ 7s over the Golan Heights . 
 The next morning saw the squadron participate in Operation <unk> , a SEAD offensive against Egyptian air defences , which began with strikes against Egyptian air bases . Seven Phantoms led by squadron leader Yoram Agmon struck the air base at <unk> , and although two defending MiG @-@ 21s were shot down , the strike failed to cause significant damage . <unk> , moreover , was quickly discontinued when the dire situation on the Golan Heights became apparent , and 69 Squadron efforts were redirected north where the IAF staged the ill @-@ fated Operation <unk> 5 . Flying with outdated intelligence and no electronic screening against mobile SAM batteries and heavy flak , 6 IAF Phantoms were lost , including 69 Squadron 's Ehud Hankin and Shaul Levy in Kurnass 123 . Both were killed . The same evening saw appeals for help from the southern front , leading the squadron to fly strike missions against Egyptian bridges and assembly point on the Suez Canal . Another Phantom was lost to surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles , its crew falling into captivity . Four more aircraft were lost on the following day , October 8 . One was lost in an otherwise successful morning strike against the Syrian air base at Dumayr , its crew captured . Another was lost over the Golan Heights , and two more during night strikes against Egyptian bridges across the canal , all falling prey to the SA @-@ 6 . Although four airmen were rescued by Israeli forces , pilot <unk> <unk> and navigator Zeev <unk> were killed . 
 Three days into the war 69 Squadron had lost six aircraft , four airmen had been killed and four became prisoners of war . The detailed planning and extensive training undertaken before the war had gone to waste and the sustained campaign required to defeat enemy air defences was abandoned in the face of Egyptian and Syrian advances . Nevertheless , it had been the close air support provided by the IAF that helped Israeli troops on the ground to stem the tide and eventually go on the offensive , first in the north and later in the south . October 10 saw the Hammers strike the Egyptian air base at <unk> , while two Syrian MiGs were claimed on the northern front . The next day saw the IDF push into Syria , and 69 Squadron was at hand striking fuel depots , SAM sites and the air bases at Dumayr , <unk> and Damascus . One aircraft was lost over Lebanon , where its crew were interned until the end of the war . Syria was the primary target for air base strikes on October 12 and 13 as well . Yoram Agmon and Daniel <unk> claimed two aerial victories , one on each of these two days , but the squadron lost another aircraft on October 14 , possibly the result of friendly fire on the southern front , though the crew was rescued . The same day witnessed the IAF begin receiving attrition replacements from USAF stocks . These Phantoms were delivered in their darker Southeast Asia scheme and rushed into service without repainting , gaining the name " Toads " . To ease maintenance , most were retained by 69 Squadron which transferred several of its airframes to 201 Squadron . Unlike Israeli aircraft , the new aircraft were equipped with <unk> targeting equipment , allowing them to launch the AGM @-@ 65 Maverick , another component of the American airlift . 69 Squadron was therefore entrusted with the introduction of the Maverick into Israeli service . No training flights were flown , the first launch occurring in combat , against a Syrian @-@ held bunker on the Hermon . Some 50 missiles were launched in the course of the war . 69 Squadron continued hammering Syrian infrastructure and Egyptian air bases in the following days , and on October 16 Yoram Agmon shot down a Syrian MiG @-@ 21 to become to only pilot to achieve ace status while flying with the squadron . The Hammers flew their final air base strike of the war on October 20 , striking the EAF air base at <unk> . Pilot <unk> <unk> and navigator Yoram Rubinstein were hit by a SAM and forced to ejected , becoming POWs in Egypt . 
 = = = Postwar activity = = = 
 The Yom Kippur War ended on October 24 . 69 Squadron had flown 789 sorties , had lost 9 aircraft , and had shot down 10 enemy aircraft . Four airmen had been killed and eight had become prisoners of war . The end of the war , however , did not spell an end to the fighting . On December 6 a mixed 69 and 119 squadrons combat air patrol over the Gulf of Suez engaged a flight of MiG @-@ 21s to score one kill , possibly two . The kill was credited to 69 's Yiftach <unk> and Meir Gur , with the MiG @-@ 21s revealed to be a part of a North Korean contingent had that deployed to Egypt during the war . With the arrival of spring fighting also resumed in the north , where Israel and Syria had yet to sign a disengagement agreement . On April 8 , 1974 , while on patrol against low flying Syrian helicopters , the squadron lost one of its aircraft , probably to a shoulder @-@ launched SA @-@ 7 . The crew , <unk> and <unk> , were interned in Lebanon for a month . Three weeks later , on April 29 , the squadron scored two aerial kills against Syrian MiG @-@ 21s , the squadron 's final victories to date . Fighting only ceased on May 31 . 
 The postwar years were spent implementing the lessons of the Yom Kippur War . SEAD tactics were improved , training was stepped up and innovative technologies introduced . The Hammers cooperated with Rafael , Israel 's weapon systems development authority , in the introduction of the Tadmit electro @-@ optical fire @-@ and @-@ forget guided bomb , a modified version of the AGM @-@ 62 Walleye II . At the same time , the Phantom 's air @-@ to @-@ air role was diminished with the introduction into service of the F @-@ 15 Eagle and the F @-@ 16 Fighting Falcon . The squadron was , nonetheless , the first IAF squadron to introduce Rafael 's Python 3 into service in March 1977 . Air @-@ to @-@ air training continued and on December 29 , 1977 , during combat against a pair of F @-@ 15s , two squadron aircraft collided . Squadron leader <unk> Friedman and navigator Avihu Ikar were killed . The remains of their aircraft , Kurnass 305 , stand as a memorial to the two pilots on the Acre @-@ <unk> road . On January 20 , 1981 , the squadron lost another pilot in similar circumstances , when Kurnass 222 collided with F @-@ 16 222 . Squadron leader Eliezer Adar ejected , but Dani Weiss was killed , as was the F @-@ 16 pilot , Uri Ben @-@ Amitai . 
 The Hammers flew 28 support , 13 reconnaissance and 6 combat air patrols during Operation Litani , Israel 's March 1978 invasion of Lebanon . In 1976 the squadron had received two additional RF @-@ 4Es , and was soon flying high @-@ altitude reconnaissance . This led to its participation in the preparations for the 1981 Operation Opera to destroy Iraq 's Osirak nuclear reactor , which the Hammers were initially planned to conduct . The squadron trained for the raid using the Tadmit , but these plans were dropped when the F @-@ 16 entered IAF service in 1980 . On November 12 , 1980 , the squadron carried out the IAF 's longest fighter mission hitherto , when two reconnaissance birds photographed the reactor near Baghdad . The mission witnessed three aerial refuelings , including one over enemy territory . Tensions over Lebanon flared once more in 1981 , and on May 29 , 1981 , the squadron carried out Operation Mole 9 , striking Libyan SA @-@ 9 batteries protecting PLO bases near Beirut . 
 = = = 1982 Lebanon War = = = 
 By the spring of 1982 tensions had risen again and the attempted assassination of the Israeli ambassador to London Shlomo Argov on June 3 , 1982 , prompted Israel to launch Operation Peace for Galilee . 69 Squadron flew 27 sorties in the preparation phase for the operation , from June 4 to the actual beginning of the invasion on June 6 . The first of these were carried out on the afternoon of June 4 , when a 4 @-@ ship formation struck the stadium in Beirut , used as a PLO weapons depot . Once Israeli ground forces began pushing into Lebanon , 69 Squadron provided close air support . One aircraft was damaged by enemy flak on the first day of the invasion , and two suffered landing accidents , but with poor weather and a shortage of targets , there was initially little fighting to be done . This changed on June 8 when it became apparent the Syrian forces in Lebanon would have to be engaged , and that same afternoon two squadron Phantoms bombed a Syrian electronic warfare facility on <unk> <unk> . 
 Syrian SAMs had been a constant threat to IAF operations , and as the war progressed the Syrian SAM array in the Bekaa Valley was bolstered with additional batteries . It was therefore decided to launch a comprehensive assault on the Syrian defences , in order to secure aerial superiority over the area and ensure air support for Israeli ground forces . At 14 : 00 on June 9 the IAF launched Operation Mole Cricket 19 , the culmination of 10 years of planning and preparation . 69 Squadron participated with 13 Tadmit and four follow @-@ up free @-@ fall bombers sent against the Syrians . The former operated individually , targeting Syrian fire control centers and radars , in all engaging seven SAM batteries . Mole Cricket 19 was a resounding success , with 14 out of 19 SAM batteries in the Bekaa destroyed and dozens of Syrian fighters downed in the <unk> dogfights . After the peak of June 9 , during which 29 sorties were flown , activity declined . 12 more sorties were flown on June 10 and 19 on June 11 , when a ceasefire came into effect . The squadron had flown 152 sorties throughout the offensive , of which 71 were close air support , 35 SEAD and 31 reconnaissance . 
 Once again , the official end of hostilities did not spell an end to fighting and Israel remained engaged in Lebanon for years to come . When the Syrians introduced the SA @-@ 8 Gecko into Lebanon in July 1982 , IAF Phantoms were sent to hunt down four launchers on July 24 and two were claimed by 69 Squadron . Up to its very disbandment in 1994 , the squadron also took part in repeated strikes against terrorist organizations operating from Lebanon . On one such operation on October 16 , 1986 , a bomb exploded immediately after release from Kurnass 306 , forcing both crew to eject . The pilot , Yishai Aviram , was rescued by an IAF AH @-@ 1 Cobra , but navigator Ron Arad was captured by members of the Shi 'a Amal Movement . Initial negotiations for an exchange of prisoners failed and Arad has been missing since and his fate remains unknown . 
 In early 1986 the squadron introduced the AGM @-@ 142 Popeye into IAF service , and for nearly a decade was the only IAF squadron to operate the missile . In 1987 its Phantoms played the role of Soviet " MiG @-@ 29s " in the film " Iron Eagle II " . Filming coincided with the receipt of several birds from 105 Squadron , which appropriately appeared in the film bearing that unit 's distinctive red flash on the fuselage ( although the IAF markings were replaced with the Soviet red star insignia ) . The squadron trained extensively for possible participation in the 1990 Gulf War , but Israel eventually stayed out of that conflict . In June 1991 the squadron relocated to the air base at Hatzerim , from which it flew 79 sorties during Operation Accountability of April 1993 . In the wake of the Oslo Accords the US finally agreed to supply the IAF with the F @-@ 15E Strike Eagle , and 69 Squadron was disbanded in early 1994 in expectation of its re @-@ equipment with the new aircraft . 
 = = Thunder Squadron = = 
 Four Israeli airmen , led by future squadron leader Dror Ben @-@ David , travelled to the US in 1997 for the F @-@ 15E conversion course , and the first two aircraft landed in Hatzerim on January 19 , 1998 . 16 aircraft had arrived by January 1 , 1999 , when the squadron was declared operational , and 10 days later the unit carried out it first operational sorties over southern Lebanon . Deliveries were completed in June 2000 , by which time the squadron had taken part in operations in support of the May 2000 Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon . 
 The squadron has since undertaken numerous missions during the Second Intifada and Operation Cast Lead . During the Second Lebanon War the Hammers flew 1 @,@ 400 sorties , totalling 2 @,@ 300 flying hours , more than any other IAF combat unit . During this conflict , the Ra 'am 's long range and endurance served it well in the close support role , as the aircraft could carry more munitions and remain on station longer than any other strike aircraft . It is these capabilities that place 69 Squadron at the forefront of Israel 's strategic arm , and it is thus this unit that is reputed to have undertaken Operation Orchard , the destruction of a Syrian nuclear site on September 6 , 2007 . The squadron has also been linked to a possible Israeli strike against the Iranian nuclear program . 
 Since its reactivation , 69 Squadron has also undertaken multiple deployments abroad . It was the first Israeli unit to participate in exercise Red Flag in October 1998 , and has taken part in several Red Flags since . It has also deployed to Turkey and Italy on several occasions , and three aircraft participated in the 2001 RAF Waddington International Air Show . 
 = Hispanics in the United States Marine Corps = 
 Hispanics in the United States Marine Corps , such as Private France Silva who during the Boxer Rebellion became the first Marine of the thirteen Marines of Hispanic descent to be awarded the Medal of Honor , and Private First Class Guy Gabaldon who is credited with capturing over 1 @,@ 000 enemy soldiers and civilians during World War II , have distinguished themselves in combat . Hispanics have participated as members of the United States Marine Corps in the Boxer Rebellion , World War I , the American intervention in Latin America also known as the Banana Wars , World War II , the Korean War , the Vietnam War , the Gulf War and most recently in the military campaigns of Afghanistan and Iraq . 
 Hispanics are also reaching the top ranks of the Marine Corps , serving their country in sensitive leadership positions on domestic and foreign shores , with Generals such as Major General Angela Salinas and Lieutenant General Pedro del Valle . Many Hispanic Marines went on to distinguished careers outside of the military in different fields such as sports and space exploration . 
 Hispanics ( sometimes also referred to as " Latinos " ) in the Marine Corps account for the largest minority group of that military institution . Hispanics comprise 18 % of enlisted Marines today , up from 15 % when the Iraq War began . The United States Marine Corps has implemented an aggressive recruitment program directed towards Hispanics , which is the nation 's largest ethnic or minority race ( 2005 Census ) . According to the U.S. Census Bureau the estimated Hispanic population of the United States is over 50 million , or 16 % of the U.S. population . The 2010 U.S. Census estimate of over 50 million Hispanics in the U.S. does not include the 3 @.@ 9 million residents of Puerto Rico . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 Hispanic is an ethnic term employed to categorize any citizen or resident of the United States , of any racial background , of any country , and of any religion , who has at least one ancestor from the people of Spain or is of non @-@ Hispanic origin , but has an ancestor from Mexico , Puerto Rico , Cuba , Central or South America , or some other Hispanic origin . The three largest Hispanic groups in the United States are the Mexican @-@ Americans , Puerto Ricans and Cubans . 
 = = Background = = 
 Originally organized as the Continental Marines on November 10 , 1775 , as naval infantry , the Marine Corps has evolved in its mission with changing military doctrine and American foreign policy . The Marine Corps has participated in every American armed conflict including the Revolutionary War . 
 There are various factors which make it difficult to determine when exactly Hispanics began to serve in the Corps . One of these factors is that statistics on Hispanics were not kept by the military until the 1970s when the United States Census Bureau coined the phrase . Before then only unreliable estimates were made . For example , during World War II Hispanic Americans were estimated to comprise 2 @.@ 3 % to 4 @.@ 7 % of the Armed Forces . However , the exact number is unknown , as at the time Hispanics were integrated into the general white population census count . Separate statistics were kept for African @-@ Americans and Asian @-@ Americans . Another factor is that the estimates which have been made only take into account individuals whose surname is of Hispanic origin , when in reality there are many Hispanics with non @-@ Hispanic surnames who have served . 
 Unlike the United States Army , which had an all Puerto Rican unit ( the 65th Infantry Regiment ) and other units in the Southwest region of the United States mostly made up of Hispanics , the Marines have never had any Hispanic oriented units . 
 As of 2003 , those who joined the U.S. Armed Forces are not required to identify themselves as Hispanics , therefore a person of Hispanic descent who decides that he or she does not want to be considered as a Hispanic and chooses to identify themselves with any race was not be included in the statistics of the Department of Defense as Hispanics . 
 = = Boxer Rebellion = = 
 While specific statistics were not kept on the number of Hispanics in the Marine Corps , history documents instances of their heroic actions . During the Boxer Rebellion , Private France Silva ( 1876 – 1951 ) became the first Marine of Hispanic descent to be awarded the Medal of Honor , the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government . 
 Private Silva joined the Marines on September 12 , 1899 , in San Francisco . In 1900 , he was a member of the 1st Regiment ( Marines ) under the command of Major Littleton Waller , aboard the USS Newark ( C @-@ 1 ) . On May 20 , 1900 , the USS Newark ( C @-@ 1 ) , a United States Navy protected cruiser and the first modern cruiser in the U.S. fleet , sailed for China to help land reinforcements to relieve the legations under siege by the Boxers at Peking in what is known as the Boxer Rebellion . The Newark arrived at Tientsin on May , 22 . On May , 31 , Captain John T. Myers , USMC , arrived in Peking in overall command of two ship detachments of U.S. Marines . This newly formed Legation Guard consisted of twenty @-@ five Marines from the USS Oregon ( BB @-@ 3 ) along with twenty @-@ three Marines and five sailors from the USS Newark . Private Silva was one of the Newark Marines who were a part of the Legation Guard . 
 On June 19 , 1900 , the 1st Regiment ( Marines ) attempted to take the city of Tientsin and failed . Then , on June 23 , the Regiment , under the command of Major Waller , entered Tientsin in their second attempt after a Japanese blew open a gate to allow the Chinese to escape . Private Silva , who was seriously wounded and two sailors , Navy Seaman Axel <unk> and Chief Machinist Emil Peterson , were awarded the Medal of Honor for their defense of the civilian compound ( legation ) at Peking – they defended the walled city from June 28 until the fall of the city which occurred on August 17 . 
 = = World War I = = 
 During World War I , the Marine Corps ' 2nd Division fought alongside the U.S. Army 's 36th Infantry Division in the Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge in Champagne , France . The result of this battle was the expulsion of the Germany Army from the Champagne Region . 
 Private Joe Nichols Viera of the 78th Company , 6th Regiment , 2nd Marine Division , was awarded the Navy Cross Medal , the second highest medal that can be awarded by the U.S. Navy and which is awarded to members of the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps for heroism or distinguished service . On October 3 , 1918 , Viera , captured three enemy machine gun nests and with the aid of another Marine captured forty enemy soldiers in the Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge . He was also awarded the Distinguished Service Cross , the United States Army second highest medal , for the same action . 
 Marine aviation was fairly new , it came into existence on May 22 , 1912 , and the first major expansion of the Marine Corps ' air component , of which Puerto Rico played a major rule , came with America 's entrance into World War I. On January 6 , 1914 , First Lieutenant Bernard L. Smith established the Marine Section of the Navy Flying School in the island municipal Culebra . As the number of Marine Aviators grew so did the avid desire to separate from Naval Aviation . By doing so , the Marine Aviation was designated as separate from the United States Naval Aviation . The creation of a " Marine Corps Aviation Company in Puerto Rico consisted of 10 officers and 40 enlisted men . 
 In 1915 , Lieutenant Pedro Augusto del Valle , from San Juan , Puerto Rico , graduated from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland . Lieutenant del Valle helped the Marine Corps in the capture of Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic , in 1916 , for which he was awarded his first Legion of Merit . He commanded the Marine detachment on board the USS Texas ( BB @-@ 35 ) ( BB @-@ 35 ) in the North Atlantic during World War I. In 1919 , del Valle participated in the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet . 
 = = Second Nicaraguan Campaign 1926 – 1933 = = 
 Civil war broke out in Nicaragua during the first months of 1926 , and upon the request of the Nicaraguan government , 3 @,@ 000 U.S. Marines were sent to establish a neutral zone for the protection of American citizens . The American intervention was also known as the Banana Wars . Both Captain Pedro del Valle and Private Rafel Toro from Puerto Rico , participated in the Second Nicaraguan Campaign . 
 In 1926 , Captain del Valle served with the Gendarmerie of Haiti for three years and during that time , he also became active in the war against Augusto Sandino in Nicaragua . In 1927 , Lieutenant Jaime Sabater , from San Juan , Puerto Rico , graduated from United States Naval Academy . 
 Private Rafel Toro , from Humacao , Puerto Rico , was part of the U.S. Marine Corps occupation force in Nicaragua , serving with the Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua . On July 25 , 1927 , Private Toro was on advance guard duty into Nueva Segovia . As he rode into town , he was attacked ; returning fire , he was able to hold back the enemy until reinforcements arrived . He was mortally wounded in this action for which he was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross . 
 In 1931 , Brigadier General Randolph C. Berkeley appointed Pedro del Valle to the " Landing Operations Text Board " in Quantico , the first organizational step taken by the Marines to develop a working doctrine for amphibious assault . In 1932 , he wrote an essay titled " Ship @-@ to @-@ Shore in Amphibious Operations " which was published in the Marine Corps Gazette . In his essay , he stressed the importance of a coordinated amphibious assault and of an execution of an opposed landing , a principal which the Marine Corps were to put into practice in World War II . 
 In 1933 , Lieutenant James Rockwell , a native of San Juan , Puerto Rico , became the third Marine of Hispanic ( Puerto Rican ) descent to graduate from the USNA .
