 This game was a dramatic win for Spassky , his first since games 1 and 2 . As in game 7 , Fischer essayed his favorite Poisoned Pawn Variation ; Spassky surprised him with the startling <unk> ( given ! ! by many <unk> at the time ) , retreating the knight to its starting position . Although later analysis showed that the move was only sufficient for equality if Black responded correctly , Fischer did not . If 15 ... Ne7 ! ? by Black then <unk> ! ? and the game is unclear ( Gipslis ) . After inferior defense by Fischer , Spassky trapped Fischer 's queen and handed him his only defeat ever as Black in the Poisoned Pawn .

 Fischer avoided the Sicilian Defence , with which he had lost game 11 , instead preferring Alekhine 's Defence . After 8 ... a5 ! 9.a4 ? ( <unk> ! ? and Black is only slightly better ; Gligorić ) dxe5 <unk> Na6 ! 11 @.@ 0 @-@ 0 Nc5 , Fischer had the upper hand ( <unk> ) . The game swung one way , then another , and was finally adjourned at move 42 with Fischer having an edge in a sharp position but no clear win . The Soviet team 's analysis convinced them that the position was drawn . Fischer stayed up until 8 a.m. the following morning analyzing it ( the resumption being at 2 : 30 p.m. ) . He had not found a win either . Amazingly , he managed to set traps for Spassky , who fell into them and lost . Spassky 's seconds were stunned , and Spassky himself refused to leave the board for a long time after the game was over , unable to believe the result . He remarked , " It is very strange . How can one lose with the opponent 's only rook locked in completely at g8 ? " 
 Lombardy noted the shock that Spassky was in after he resigned : 
 While Fischer dashed for his car , Spassky remained glued to his seat . A sympathetic Lothar Schmid came over , and the two shifted the pieces about with Boris demonstrating his careless mistakes . The two were left wondering how Bobby could have squeezed a win from a position which a night of competent analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw . 
 Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik said that this game made a particularly strong impression on him . He called it " the highest creative achievement of Fischer " . He resolved a drawish opposite @-@ colored bishops endgame by sacrificing his bishop and trapping his own rook . " Then five passed pawns struggled with the white rook . Nothing similar had been seen before in chess " . 
 David Bronstein said " Of all the games from the match , the 13th appeals to me most of all . When I play through the game I still cannot grasp the innermost motive behind this or that plan or even individual move . Like an enigma , it still teases my imagination . "

 The next seven games ( games 14 through 20 ) were drawn . Fischer was unable to get the initiative . Spassky was choosing lines that Fischer was unable to break . With a three @-@ point lead , Fischer was content to inch towards the title , and Spassky seemed resigned to his fate . The off @-@ the @-@ board antics continued , including a lawsuit against Fischer for damages by Chester Fox , who had filming rights to the match ( Fischer had objected to what he said were noticeable camera noises , and the Icelandic hosts had reluctantly – they were to share in film revenues along with the two contestants – removed the television cameras ) , a Fischer demand to remove the first seven rows of spectators ( eventually , three rows were cleared ) , and Soviet claims that Fischer was using electronic and chemical devices to ' control ' Spassky , resulting in an Icelandic police sweep of the hall .

Several days after Prescott 's capture , he was escorted to General George Washington 's headquarters , but on the trip came to dine at Alden 's tavern .

 = Hay Castle = 
 Hay Castle is a medieval fortification and 17th @-@ century mansion house in the small town of Hay @-@ on @-@ Wye in Powys , Wales . Originally constructed as part of the Norman invasion of Wales , the castle was designed as a ringwork overlooking the town in either the late @-@ 11th or early @-@ 12th centuries . It was rebuilt in stone around 1200 by the de Braose family and then had a turbulent history , being attacked and burnt several times during the First and Second Barons ' Wars , the wars with the Welsh princes , the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr and the Wars of the Roses . In the 17th century a Jacobean mansion house was built alongside the medieval keep and the property became a private home . Serious fires in 1939 and 1977 gutted the castle and , despite repairs in the 1980s , by the 21st century much of the building was derelict and unstable . Since 2011 it has been owned by the Hay Castle Trust who plan to renovate the property to form an arts and education centre . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 11th – 16th centuries = = = 
 The Normans began to make incursions into South Wales from the late @-@ 1060s onwards , pushing westwards from their bases in recently occupied England . Their advance was marked by the construction of castles and the creation of regional lordships . The Norman adventurer Bernard de Neufmarché conquered Brecknock in 1091 and assigned the manor of Hay to one of his followers , Philip Walwyn . The first castle in Hay , later abandoned , was built by St Mary 's church outside the main settlement , where a motte known as Hay <unk> still survives . The English lordship of Hay , known as Hay Anglicana , became a wealthy walled town and the lands passed by marriage to Miles of Gloucester and then into the de Braose family . In the late 11th or early 12th century , a new fortification was built inside Hay @-@ on @-@ Wye itself , on high ground around 200 metres ( 660 ft ) from the old motte , taking the form of an earth ringwork with a stone gate @-@ tower . 
 The de Braose dynasty expanded Hay Castle in stone around 1200 with a curtain wall reinforced by intramural timbers , turning the gate @-@ tower into a keep . The castle tenants used the chapel of St John in the town for their worship . During the First Barons ' War , Reginald de Braose joined the alliance against King John who successfully attacked the castle in 1215 . The Welsh prince Llewelyn the Great attacked and burnt the town and castle in 1231 and the castle was then rebuilt by Henry III in 1233 . During the Second Barons ' War , Prince Edward captured the castle in 1263 but it was recaptured and burnt by Simon de Montfort and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd the following year . It was further damaged by the Welsh rebellion led by Owain Glyndŵr around 1401 and in 1460 during the Wars of the Roses . By the time the antiquarian John Leland visited in the 16th century , the town of Hay was " wonderfully <unk> " although the castle was described as having once " bene right stately " . 
 = = = 17th – 19th centuries = = = 
 Hay Castle was substantially expanded in the 17th century , creating a Jacobean mansion . Two explanations have been offered by historians for this redevelopment . One option is that during the first half of the 17th century , Howell Gwynne built a manor house to the west of the old keep , which was replaced by a new mansion in 1660 by James Boyle of Hereford . Another reverses this sequence , suggesting that James Boyle left the castle to Howell Gwynne in 1603 , and that the mansion was built at the beginning of the century . In either case , the Jacobean building was two storeys tall , three with its facade included , and featured seven dormer gables in a Dutch style and a large staircase . It was built from stone and incorporated the upper floors of the old keep into its design . Formal gardens were constructed outside the keep either around the start of the 17th century or after 1660 . In 1702 , the house was divided up among different tenants , and passed into the hands of the local Wellington family . Until 1812 , the basement of the keep was used to supplement the town gaol . 
 In 1809 , the industrialist Sir Joseph Bailey leased the castle , going on to purchase it outright in 1844 , and established a walled kitchen garden known as Castle Gardens to the south @-@ west of the main castle . It was used as a vicarage from 1825 onwards , including by Archdeacon William Bevan . The terraced gardens were maintained during the 19th century , with various trees planted behind the castle in the 1860s and 1870s , and a stable block was built within the grounds .

 Between 1904 and 1906 the castle was rented by the Morell family , after which it was occupied by the Dowager Lady <unk> . The architect W. D. Caroe was employed to restore the house in 1910 and it was sold to the banker Benjamin <unk> in 1937 . A major fire then destroyed the interior of the eastern side of the castle in 1939 . Around 1961 , the castle was acquired by Richard Booth who used it as a bookstore and as a location for parties , with a holiday cottage in the grounds . Much of the walled garden was sold for development in 1975 , and another fire in 1977 destroyed the interior of the western half of the castle : repairs were carried out from the 1980s onwards . 
 In 2011 the castle was sold for around £ 2 million to the Hay Castle Trust , who intended to turn it into an arts and education centre . The firm of Rick Mather Architects were taken on in 2015 to manage the work at a projected cost of £ 4 @.@ 35 million , to include a new art gallery and a viewing point at the top of the keep . A grant of £ 528 @,@ 600 from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2014 supported initial planning , and further grants were given by the Country Houses Foundation and the Headley Trust . 
 The castle site is now approximately 110 by 100 metres ( 360 by 330 ft ) across . As of 2015 , the derelict , roofless parts of the castle are in a poor structural condition and infested with ivy , with other parts suffering from death watch beetle . None of the earthworks or curtain wall survive , except for a small portion next to the gateway ; this fragment of wall is 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) thick and shows the original bank to have been as much as 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) high when viewed from the outside , but is now in danger of collapse . The wooden door on the left side of the gateway probably dates from around 1300 , and the right door from the early @-@ 17th century , but they are currently unusable . There are some limited remains of the old walled garden interspersed in the modern housing estate . The main castle site is protected under law as a Grade I listed building . 
 = Franklin Pierce = 
 Franklin Pierce ( November 23 , 1804 – October 8 , 1869 ) was the 14th President of the United States ( 1853 – 57 ) . Pierce was a northern Democrat who saw the abolitionist movement as a fundamental threat to the unity of the nation . His polarizing actions in championing and signing the Kansas – Nebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act failed to stem intersectional conflict , setting the stage for Southern secession . 
 Born in New Hampshire , Pierce served in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate until he resigned from the latter in 1842 . His private law practice in his home state was a success ; he was appointed U.S. Attorney for his state in 1845 . Pierce took part in the Mexican – American War as a brigadier general in the Army . Seen by Democrats as a compromise candidate uniting northern and southern interests , he was nominated as the party 's candidate for president on the 49th ballot at the 1852 Democratic National Convention . In the 1852 presidential election , Pierce and his running mate William R. King easily defeated the Whig Party ticket of Winfield Scott and William A. Graham . 
 While Pierce was popular and outgoing , his family life was a grim affair , with his wife Jane suffering from illness and depression for much of her life . All of their children died young , their last son being gruesomely killed in a train accident while the family was traveling shortly before Pierce 's inauguration . As president , Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage , an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him . Pierce was a Young America expansionist who signed the Gadsden Purchase of land from Mexico and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain . He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan , while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability , but these successes were overshadowed by political strife . 
 His popularity in the Northern states declined sharply after he supported the Kansas – Nebraska Act , which nullified the Missouri Compromise , while many whites in the South continued to support him . Passage of the act led to violent conflict over the expansion of slavery in the American West . Pierce 's administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the Ostend Manifesto , calling for the annexation of Cuba , a document which was roundly criticized . Although Pierce fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats in the 1856 presidential election , he was abandoned by his party and his bid failed . His reputation in the North suffered further during the Civil War as he became a vocal critic of President Abraham Lincoln . Pierce , who had been a heavy drinker for much of his life , died of severe cirrhosis of the liver in 1869 . US historians and other political commentators generally rank Pierce 's presidency among the worst .

 = = = Childhood and education = = = 
 Franklin Pierce was born on November 23 , 1804 , in a log cabin in Hillsborough , New Hampshire . He was a sixth @-@ generation descendant of Thomas Pierce , who had moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from Norwich , Norfolk , England , in about 1634 . Pierce 's father Benjamin , a Revolutionary War lieutenant , moved from Chelmsford , Massachusetts to Hillsborough after the war , purchasing 50 acres ( 20 ha ) of land . Pierce was the fifth of eight children born to Benjamin and his second wife , Anna Kendrick ( his first wife Elizabeth Andrews died in childbirth , leaving a daughter ) . Benjamin was by then a prominent Democratic @-@ Republican state legislator , farmer , and tavern @-@ keeper . During Pierce 's childhood his father was deeply involved in state politics , while two of his older brothers fought in the War of 1812 ; public affairs and the military were thus a major influence in his early life . 
 Pierce 's father , who sought to ensure that his sons were educated , placed Pierce in a school at Hillsborough Center in childhood and sent him to the town school at Hancock at the age of 12 . The boy was not fond of schooling . Growing homesick at Hancock , he walked 12 miles ( 19 km ) back to his home one Sunday . His father fed him dinner and drove him part of the distance back to school before kicking him out of the carriage and ordering him to walk the rest of the way in a thunderstorm . Pierce later cited this moment as " the turning @-@ point in my life " . Later that year he transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy to prepare for college . By this time he had built a reputation as a charming student , sometimes prone to misbehavior . 
 In fall 1820 , Pierce entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick , Maine , one of nineteen freshmen . He joined the Athenian Society , a progressive literary society , alongside Jonathan Cilley ( later elected to Congress ) and Nathaniel Hawthorne ( the author ) , with whom he formed lasting friendships . Last in his class after two years , he worked hard to improve his grades and in 1824 graduated in fifth place in a graduating class of fourteen . In Pierce 's junior year , John P. Hale , a later political ally and then rival of Pierce 's , also enrolled at Bowdoin . That year , Pierce organized and led an unofficial militia company , the Bowdoin Cadets , which included Cilley and Hawthorne . The unit performed drill on campus near the president 's house until the noise caused him to demand it halt . The students rebelled and went on strike , an event Pierce was suspected of leading . During his final year at Bowdoin , he spent several months teaching at a school in rural Hebron , Maine , where his students included future Congressman John J. Perry , and he earned his first salary . 
 After briefly reading law with former New Hampshire Governor Levi Woodbury , a family friend , in Portsmouth , he spent a semester at Northampton Law School in Northampton , Massachusetts , followed by a period of study in 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst , New Hampshire . He was admitted to the bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough . Pierce lost his first case , but soon proved capable as a lawyer . Despite never being a legal scholar , his memory for names and faces served him well , as did his personal charm and deep voice . In Hillsborough , his law partner was Albert Baker , who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy .

 By 1824 , New Hampshire was a hotbed of partisanship , with figures such as Woodbury and Isaac Hill laying the groundwork for a party of Democrats in support of General Andrew Jackson . They opposed the established Federalists ( and their successors , the National Republicans ) , who were led by sitting President John Quincy Adams . The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827 , when their pro @-@ Jackson nominee , Benjamin Pierce , won the support of the pro @-@ Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed . While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney , he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the 1828 presidential election between Adams and Jackson approached . In the state elections held in March 1828 , the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce , voting him out of office , but Franklin Pierce won his first election : Hillsborough town moderator , a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years . 
 Pierce actively campaigned in his district on behalf of Jackson , who carried both the district and the nation by large margins in the November 1828 election , even though he lost New Hampshire . The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party , and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year , representing Hillsborough in the New Hampshire House of Representatives . Pierce 's father , meanwhile , was elected again as governor , retiring after that term . The younger Pierce was appointed as chairman of the House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year . By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority , and Pierce was elected Speaker of the House . The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion of banking , protect the state militia , and offer support to the national Democrats and Jackson 's re @-@ election effort . At the age of 27 , he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party . Though attaining early political and professional success , in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough . 
 Like all white males in New Hampshire between the ages of 18 and 45 , Pierce was a member of the state militia , and was appointed aide de camp to Governor Samuel <unk> in 1831 . He remained in the militia until 1847 , and attained the rank of colonel before becoming a brigadier general in the Army during the Mexican – American War . Interested in revitalizing and reforming the state militias , which had become increasingly dormant during the years of peace following the War of 1812 , Pierce worked with Alden Partridge , president of Norwich University , a military college in Vermont , and Truman B. Ransom and Alonzo Jackman , Norwich faculty members and militia officers , to increase recruiting efforts and improve training and readiness . Pierce served as a Norwich University trustee from 1841 to 1859 , and received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Norwich in 1853 . 
 In late 1832 , the Democratic Party convention nominated Pierce for one of New Hampshire 's five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives . This was tantamount to election for the young Democrat , as the National Republicans had faded as a political force , while the Whigs had not yet begun to attract a large following . Democratic strength in New Hampshire was also bolstered by Jackson 's landslide re @-@ election that year . New Hampshire had been a marginal state politically , but from 1832 through the mid @-@ 1850s became the most reliably Democratic state in the North , boosting Pierce 's political career . Pierce 's term began in March 1833 , but he would not be sworn in until Congress met in December , and his attention was elsewhere . He had recently become engaged and bought his first house in Hillsborough . Franklin and Benjamin Pierce were among the prominent citizens who welcomed President Jackson to the state on his visit in mid @-@ 1833 . 
 = = = Marriage and children = = = 
 On November 19 , 1834 , Pierce married Jane Means Appleton ( March 12 , 1806 – December 2 , 1863 ) , the daughter of Jesse Appleton , a Congregational minister and former president of Bowdoin College , and Elizabeth Means . The Appletons were prominent Whigs , in contrast with the Pierces ' Democratic affiliation . Jane was shy , devoutly religious , and pro @-@ temperance , encouraging Pierce to abstain from alcohol . She was somewhat gaunt , and constantly ill from tuberculosis and psychological ailments . She abhorred politics and especially disliked Washington , D.C. , creating a tension that would continue throughout Pierce 's political ascent . 
 Jane disliked Hillsborough as well , and in 1838 , the Pierces relocated to the state capital , Concord , New Hampshire . They had three sons , all of whom died in childhood . Franklin , Jr . ( February 2 – 5 , 1836 ) died in infancy , while Frank Robert ( August 27 , 1839 – November 14 , 1843 ) died at the age of four from epidemic typhus . Benjamin ( April 13 , 1841 – January 6 , 1853 ) died at the age of 11 in a train accident .

 Pierce departed in November 1833 for Washington , D.C. , where the Twenty @-@ third United States Congress convened its regular session on December 2 . Jackson 's second term was under way , and the House had a strong Democratic majority , whose primary focus was to prevent the Second Bank of the United States from being rechartered . The Democrats , including Pierce , defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party , and the bank 's charter expired . Pierce broke from his party on occasion , opposing Democratic bills to fund internal improvements with federal money . He saw both the bank and infrastructure spending as unconstitutional , with internal improvements the responsibility of the states . Pierce 's first term was fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint , and he was easily re @-@ elected in March 1835 . When not in Washington , he attended to his law practice , and in December 1835 returned to the capital for the Twenty @-@ fourth Congress . 
 As abolitionism grew more vocal in the mid @-@ 1830s , Congress was inundated with petitions from anti @-@ slavery groups seeking legislative action to restrict slavery in the United States . From the beginning , Pierce found the abolitionists ' " agitation " to be an annoyance , and saw federal action against slavery as an infringement on southern states ' rights , even though he was morally opposed to slavery itself . He was also frustrated with the " religious bigotry " of abolitionists , who cast their political opponents as sinners . " I consider slavery a social and political evil , " Pierce said , " and most sincerely wish that it had no existence upon the face of the earth . " Still , he wrote in December 1835 , " One thing must be perfectly apparent to every intelligent man . This abolition movement must be crushed or there is an end to the Union . " 
 When Rep. James Henry Hammond of South Carolina looked to prevent anti @-@ slavery petitions from reaching the House floor , however , Pierce sided with the abolitionists ' right to petition . Nevertheless , Pierce supported what came to be known as the gag rule , which allowed for petitions to be received , but not read or considered . This passed the House in 1836 . He was attacked by the New Hampshire anti @-@ slavery Herald of Freedom as a " <unk> " , which had the dual meaning of " craven @-@ spirited man " and " northerner with southern sympathies " . Pierce had stated that not one in five hundred New <unk> were abolitionists ; the article added up the number of signatures on petitions from that state and divided by the census figure . He was outraged when South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun read the article on the Senate floor . After Pierce gave a speech indicating that most signatories were women and children , without the vote , Calhoun apologized . 
 = = = U.S. Senate = = = 
 The resignation in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill , who had been elected governor of New Hampshire , left a brief interim opening to be filled by the state legislature . With Hill 's term as senator due to expire in March 1837 , the legislature also had to fill the six @-@ year term to follow . Pierce 's candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P. Hale , a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin . After much debate , the legislature chose John Page to fill the rest of Hill 's term . In December 1836 , Pierce was elected to the full term , to commence in March 1837 , becoming at age 32 one of the youngest member in Senate history to that point . The election came at a difficult time for Pierce , as his father , sister , and brother were all seriously ill , while Jane continued to suffer from chronic poor health . As senator , he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne , who often struggled financially , procuring a sinecure as <unk> of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to continue writing . 
 Pierce voted the party line on most issues . He was an able senator , but not an eminent one ; he was overshadowed by the Great Triumvirate of Calhoun , Henry Clay , and Daniel Webster , who dominated the Senate . Pierce entered the Senate at a time of economic crisis , as the Panic of 1837 had begun . He considered the depression a result of the banking system 's rapid growth , amidst " the extravagance of <unk> and the wilderness of speculation " . So that federal money would not support speculative bank loans , he supported newly elected Democratic president Martin Van Buren and his plan to create an independent treasury , a proposal which split the Democratic Party . Debate over slavery continued in Congress , and abolitionists proposed its end in the District of Columbia , where Congress had jurisdiction . Pierce supported a resolution by Calhoun against this proposal , which Pierce considered a dangerous stepping stone to nationwide emancipation . Meanwhile , the Whigs were growing in congressional strength , which would leave Pierce 's party with only a small majority by the end of the decade . 
 One topic of particular importance to Pierce was the military . He challenged a bill which would expand the ranks of the Army 's staff officers in Washington without any apparent benefit to line officers at posts in the rest of the country . He took an interest in military pensions , seeing abundant fraud within the system , and was named chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Pensions in the Twenty @-@ sixth Congress ( 1839 – 1841 ) . In that capacity , he urged the modernization and expansion of the Army , with a focus on militias and mobility rather than on coastal fortifications , which he considered outdated . 
 Pierce campaigned vigorously throughout his home state for Van Buren 's re @-@ election in the 1840 presidential election . The incumbent carried New Hampshire but lost the national vote to William Henry Harrison , the military hero , whose Whigs took a majority of seats in the Twenty @-@ seventh Congress . Harrison died after a month in office , and Vice President John Tyler succeeded him . Pierce and the Democrats were quick to challenge the new administration , questioning the removal of federal officeholders , and opposing Whig plans for a national bank . In December 1841 Pierce decided to resign from Congress , something he had been planning for some time . New Hampshire Democrats felt that no one should hold one of the state 's Senate seats for longer than one six @-@ year term . Thus , he had little likelihood of re @-@ election . Also , he was frustrated at being a member of the legislative minority and wished to devote his time to his family and law practice . His last acts in the Senate before resigning in February 1842 were to oppose a bill distributing federal funds to the states – believing that the money should go to the military instead – and to challenge the Whigs to reveal the results of their investigation of the New York Customs House , where the Whigs had probed for Democratic corruption for nearly a year but had issued no findings .

 = = = Lawyer and politician = = = 
 Despite his resignation from the Senate , Pierce had no intention of leaving public life . The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases , and allowed Jane a more robust community life . Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce 's Senate term , and this separation had taken a toll on the family . Pierce , meanwhile , had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional recesses . Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842 , and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish . Known for his gracious personality , eloquence , and excellent memory , Pierce would attract large audiences to hear him in court . He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation . 
 Pierce remained involved in the state Democratic Party , which was split by several issues . Governor Hill , who represented the commercial , urban wing of the party , advocated the use of government charters to support corporations , granting them privileges such as limited liability and eminent domain for building railroads . The radical " <unk> " wing of his party represented farmers and other rural voters , who sought an expansion of social programs and labor regulations and a restriction on corporate privilege . The state 's political culture grew less tolerant of banks and corporations in the wake of the Panic of 1837 , and Hill was voted out of office . Pierce was closer to the radicals philosophically , and reluctantly served as attorney against Hill in a dispute regarding ownership of a newspaper — Hill lost , and founded his own , in which Pierce was a frequent target . 
 In June 1842 Pierce was named chairman of the State Democratic Committee . In the following year 's state election he helped the radical wing take over the state legislature . The party remained divided on several issues , including railroad development and the temperance movement , and Pierce took a leading role in helping the state legislature settle their differences . His priorities were " order , moderation , compromise , and party unity " , which he tried to place ahead of his personal views on political issues . As he would as president , Pierce valued Democratic Party unity highly , and saw opposition to slavery as a threat to that . 
 The surprise victory of dark horse Democratic candidate James K. Polk in the 1844 presidential election was welcome news to Pierce , who had befriended the former Speaker of the House while both served in Congress . Pierce had campaigned heavily for Polk during the election , and in turn Polk appointed him United States Attorney for New Hampshire . Polk 's most prominent cause was the annexation of Texas , an issue which caused a dramatic split between Pierce and his former ally Hale , now a U.S. Representative . Hale was so impassioned against adding a new slave state that he wrote a letter to 1 @,@ 400 Democrats in New Hampshire outlining his opposition to the measure . Pierce responded by re @-@ assembling the state Democratic convention to revoke Hale 's nomination for another term in Congress . The political firestorm led to Pierce cutting off ties with his longtime friend , and with his law partner Fowler , who was a Hale supporter . Hale refused to withdraw , and as a majority vote was needed for election in New Hampshire , the party split led to deadlock and a vacant House seat . Eventually , the Whigs and Hale 's Independent Democrats took control of the legislature , elected Whig Anthony Colby as governor and sent Hale to the Senate , much to Pierce 's anger .

 Active military service was a long @-@ held dream for Pierce , who had admired his father 's and brothers ' service in his youth , particularly his older brother Benjamin 's , as well as that of John McNeil Jr . , husband of Pierce 's older half @-@ sister Elizabeth . As a legislator , he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias . As a militia officer himself , he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops . When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846 , Pierce immediately volunteered to join , although no New England regiment yet existed . His hope to fight in the war was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk 's Attorney General . General Zachary Taylor 's advance slowed in northern Mexico , and General Winfield Scott proposed capturing the port of Vera Cruz and driving overland to Mexico City . Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments , and Pierce was appointed colonel and commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment in February 1847 , with Truman B. Ransom as lieutenant colonel and second @-@ in @-@ command . 
 On March 3 , 1847 , Pierce was promoted to brigadier general , and took command of a brigade of reinforcements for General Scott 's army , with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment . Needing time to assemble his brigade , Pierce reached the already @-@ seized port of Vera Cruz in late June , where he prepared a march of 2 @,@ 500 men accompanying supplies to take to Scott . The three @-@ week journey inland was perilous , and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott 's army in early August , in time for the Battle of Contreras . The battle was disastrous for Pierce : his horse was suddenly startled during a charge , knocking him groin @-@ first against his saddle . The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell , pinning Pierce underneath and leaving him with a debilitating knee injury . The incident made it look like he had fainted , causing one soldier to call for someone else to take command , " General Pierce is a damned coward . " Pierce returned for the following day 's action , but again injured his knee , forcing him to hobble after his men , and by the time he caught up , the battle had mostly been won . 
 As the Battle of Churubusco approached , Pierce was ordered by Scott to the rear . He responded , " For God 's sake , General , this is the last great battle , and I must lead my brigade . " Scott yielded , and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle , but the pain in his leg became so great that he passed out on the field . The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped negotiate an armistice . He then returned to command and led his brigade throughout the rest of the campaign , eventually taking part in the capture of Mexico City in mid @-@ September , although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle . He spent much of that battle in the sick tent , plagued with acute diarrhea . Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three @-@ month occupation of the city , while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations , and tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals . 
 Pierce was finally allowed to return to Concord in late December 1847 . He was given a hero 's welcome in his home state and issued his resignation from the Army , which was approved on March 20 , 1848 . His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire , but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long follow him . He had demonstrated competence as a general , especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz , but his short tenure and his injury left little for historians to judge his ability as a military commander . 
 Ulysses S. Grant , who had the opportunity to observe Pierce firsthand during the war , countered the allegations of cowardice in his memoirs , written several years after Pierce 's death : " Whatever General Pierce 's qualifications may have been for the Presidency , he was a gentleman and a man of courage . I was not a supporter of him politically , but I knew him more intimately than I did any other of the volunteer generals . " 
 = = = Return to New Hampshire = = = 
 Returning to Concord , Pierce resumed his law work ; in one notable case he defended the religious liberty of the Shakers , the insular sect who were being threatened with legal action over accusations of abuse . His role as a party leader , however , continued to take up most of his attention . He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale , who was stridently anti @-@ slavery and had opposed the war , stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation . 
 The large Mexican Cession of land had divided the United States politically , with many in the North insisting that slavery not be allowed there ( and offering the Wilmot Proviso to ensure it ) , while others wanted slavery barred north of the Missouri Compromise line of 36 ° 30 ′ N. Both proposals were anathema to Southerners , and the controversy divided the Democrats . At the 1848 Democratic National Convention , the majority nominated former Michigan senator Lewis Cass for president , while a minority broke off to become the Free Soil Party , backing former president Van Buren . The Whigs chose General Zachary Taylor , a Louisianan , whose views on most political issues were unknown . Despite his past support for Van Buren , Pierce supported Cass , turning down the quiet offer of second place on the Free Soil ticket , and was so effective that Taylor , who was elected president , was held in New Hampshire to his lowest percentage in any state . 
 Senator Henry Clay , a Whig , hoped to put the slavery question to rest with what became known as the Compromise of 1850 , which would give some victories to both slaveholders and abolitionists , and gained the support of his fellow Whig , Webster . With the proposal stalled in the Senate , Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas led an effort to split it into separate bills so that each legislator could vote against the parts his state opposed without endangering the overall package . This was done , and the bills passed , to be signed by President Millard Fillmore ( who had succeeded Taylor after the president 's death earlier in 1850 ) . Pierce strongly supported the compromise , giving a well @-@ received speech in December 1850 pledging himself to " The Union ! Eternal Union ! " The same month , the Democratic candidate for governor , John Atwood , issued a letter opposing the Compromise , and Pierce helped to recall the state convention and remove Atwood from the ticket . The fiasco would compromise the election for the Democrats , who lost several races . Still , Pierce 's party retained its control over the state , and was well positioned for the upcoming presidential election . 
 = = Election of 1852 = = 
 As the 1852 presidential election approached , the Democrats were divided by the slavery issue , though most of the " Barnburners " who had left the party with Van Buren to form the Free Soil Party had returned . It was widely expected that the 1852 Democratic National Convention would result in deadlock , with no major candidate able to win the necessary two @-@ thirds majority . New Hampshire Democrats , including Pierce , supported his old teacher , Levi Woodbury , by then an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court , as a compromise candidate , but Woodbury 's death in September 1851 opened up an opportunity for Pierce 's allies to present him as a potential dark horse in the mold of Polk . New Hampshire Democrats felt that , as the state in which their party had most consistently gained Democratic majorities , they should supply the presidential candidate . Other possible standard @-@ bearers included Douglas , Cass , William Marcy of New York , James Buchanan of Pennsylvania , Sam Houston of Texas , and Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri . 
 Despite the backing of his home state , Pierce faced obstacles in gaining the nomination , as he had not held elective office in a decade , and lacked the front @-@ runners ' national reputation . He publicly declared that such a nomination would be " utterly repugnant to my tastes and wishes " , but given the desire of New Hampshire Democrats to see one of their own elected , knew that his position as a party leader would be endangered if he was unwilling to run . Thus , he quietly allowed his supporters to lobby for him , with the understanding that his name would not be entered at the convention unless it was clear none of the front @-@ runners could win . To broaden his potential base of southern support as the convention approached , he wrote letters reiterating his support for the Compromise of 1850 , including the controversial Fugitive Slave Act . 
 The convention assembled on June 1 in Baltimore , Maryland , and the deadlock occurred as expected . The first ballot was taken on June 3 . Of 288 delegates , Cass claimed 116 , Buchanan 93 , and the rest were scattered , without a single vote for Pierce . The next 34 ballots passed with no one near victory , and still no votes for Pierce . The Buchanan team decided to have their delegates vote for minor candidates , including Pierce , to demonstrate that no one but Buchanan could win . It was hoped that once delegates realized this , the convention would unite behind Buchanan . This novel tactic backfired after several ballots as Virginia , New Hampshire , and Maine switched to Pierce ; the remaining Buchanan forces began to break for Marcy , and before long Pierce was in third place . After the 48th ballot , North Carolina Congressman James C. Dobbin delivered an unexpected and passionate endorsement of Pierce , sparking a wave of support for the dark horse candidate . On the 49th ballot , Pierce received all but six of the votes , and thus gained the Democratic nomination for president . Delegates selected Alabama Senator William R. King , a Buchanan supporter , as Pierce 's running mate , and adopted a party platform that rejected further " agitation " over the slavery issue and supported the Compromise of 1850 . 
 When word reached New Hampshire of the result , Pierce found it difficult to believe , and his wife fainted . Their son Benjamin wrote to his mother hoping that Franklin 's candidacy would not be successful , as he knew she would not like to live in Washington . 
 The Whig candidate was General Scott , whom Pierce had served under in Mexico ; his running mate was Secretary of the Navy William A. Graham . The Whigs could not unify their factions as the Democrats had , and the convention adopted a platform almost indistinguishable from that of the Democrats , including support of the Compromise of 1850 . This incited the Free Soilers to field their own candidate , Senator Hale of New Hampshire , at the expense of the Whigs . The lack of political differences reduced the campaign to a bitter personality contest and helped to dampen voter turnout in the election to its lowest level since 1836 ; it was , according to Pierce biographer Peter A. Wallner , " one of the least exciting campaigns in presidential history " . Scott was harmed by the lack of enthusiasm of anti @-@ slavery northern Whigs for the candidate and platform ; New @-@ York Tribune editor Horace Greeley summed up the attitude of many when he said of the Whig platform , " we defy it , <unk> it , spit upon it " . 
 Pierce kept quiet so as not to upset his party 's delicate unity , and allowed his allies to run the campaign . It was the custom at the time for candidates to not appear to seek the office , and he did no personal campaigning . Pierce 's opponents caricatured him as a coward and alcoholic ( " the hero of many a well @-@ fought bottle " ) , who was an anti @-@ Catholic . Scott , meanwhile , drew weak support from the Whigs , who were torn by their pro @-@ Compromise platform and found him to be an abysmal , gaffe @-@ prone public speaker . The Democrats were confident : a popular slogan was that the Democrats " will pierce their enemies in 1852 as they poked [ that is , <unk> ] them in 1844 . " This proved to be true , as Scott won only Kentucky , Tennessee , Massachusetts and Vermont , finishing with 42 electoral votes to Pierce 's 254 . With 3 @.@ 2 million votes cast , Pierce won the popular vote with 50 @.@ 9 to 44 @.@ 1 percent . A sizable block of Free Soilers broke for Pierce 's in @-@ state rival , Hale , who won 4 @.@ 9 percent of the popular vote . The Democrats took large majorities in Congress .

 Pierce began his presidency in mourning . Weeks after his election , on January 6 , 1853 , the President @-@ elect 's family had been traveling from Boston by train when their car derailed and rolled down an embankment near Andover , Massachusetts . Pierce and Jane survived , but in the wreckage found their only remaining son , 11 @-@ year @-@ old Benjamin , crushed to death , his body nearly decapitated . Pierce was not able to hide the gruesome sight from Jane . They both suffered severe depression afterward , which likely affected Pierce 's performance as president . Jane wondered if the train accident was divine punishment for her husband 's pursuit and acceptance of high office . She wrote a lengthy letter of apology to " Benny " for her failings as a mother . Jane would avoid social functions for much of her first two years as First Lady , making her public debut in that role to great sympathy at the public reception held at the White House on New Year 's Day , 1855 . 
 Jane remained in New Hampshire as Pierce departed for his inauguration , which she did not attend . Pierce , the youngest man to be elected president to that point , chose to affirm his oath of office on a law book rather than swear it on a Bible , as all his predecessors except John Quincy Adams had done . He was the first president to deliver his inaugural address from memory . In the address he hailed an era of peace and prosperity at home and urged a vigorous assertion of U.S. interests in its foreign relations , including the " eminently important " acquisition of new territories . " The policy of my Administration " , said the new president , " will not be deterred by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion . " Avoiding the word " slavery " , he emphasized his desire to put the " important subject " to rest and maintain a peaceful union . He alluded to his own personal tragedy , telling the crowd , " You have summoned me in my weakness , you must sustain me by your strength . " 
 = = = Administration and political strife = = = 
 In his Cabinet appointments , Pierce sought to unite a party that was squabbling over the fruits of victory . Most of the party had not originally supported him for the nomination , and some had allied with the Free Soil party to gain victory in local elections . Pierce decided to allow each of the party 's factions some appointments , even those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850 . 
 All of Pierce 's cabinet nominations were confirmed unanimously and immediately by the Senate . Pierce spent the first few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower @-@ level federal positions to be filled . This was a chore , as he sought to represent all factions of the party , and could fully satisfy none of them . Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends , which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions . Before long , northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro @-@ slavery secessionists , while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism . 
 Factionalism between the pro- and anti @-@ administration Democrats ramped up quickly , especially within the New York Democratic Party . The more conservative <unk> Democrats or " Hards " of New York were deeply skeptical of the Pierce administration , which was associated with Marcy ( who became Secretary of State ) and the more moderate New York faction , the <unk> Democrats or " Softs " . 
 Buchanan had urged Pierce to consult Vice President @-@ elect King in selecting the Cabinet , but Pierce did not do so — Pierce and King never communicated once they had been selected as candidates in June 1852 . By the start of 1853 , King was severely ill with tuberculosis , and went to Cuba to recuperate . His condition deteriorated , and Congress passed a special law , allowing him to be sworn in before the American consul in Havana on March 24 . Wanting to die at home , he returned to his plantation in Alabama on April 17 and died the next day . The office of vice president remained vacant for the remainder of Pierce 's term , as the Constitution then had no provision for filling the vacancy , making the Senate President pro tempore , initially David Atchison of Missouri , next in line to the presidency . 
 Pierce sought to run a more efficient and accountable government than his predecessors . His Cabinet members implemented an early system of civil service examinations which was a forerunner to the Pendleton Act passed three decades later . The Interior Department was reformed by Secretary Robert McClelland , who systematized its operations , expanded the use of paper records , and pursued fraud . Another of Pierce 's reforms was to expand the role of the U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys , which was an important step in the eventual development of the Justice Department . There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court — Fillmore , having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees , had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator Judah P. Benjamin , who had declined . Pierce also offered the seat to Benjamin , and when the Louisianan persisted in his refusal , nominated instead John Archibald Campbell , an advocate of states ' rights ; this would be Pierce 's only Supreme Court appointment . 
 = = = Economic policy and internal improvements = = = 
 Pierce charged Treasury Secretary James Guthrie with reforming the Treasury , which was inefficiently managed , with many unsettled accounts . Guthrie increased oversight of Treasury employees and tariff collectors , many of whom were withholding money from the government . Despite laws requiring funds to be held in the Treasury , large deposits remained in private banks under the Whig administrations . Guthrie reclaimed these funds , and sought to prosecute corrupt officials , with mixed success . 
 Secretary of War Jefferson Davis , at Pierce 's request , led surveys with the Corps of Topographical Engineers of possible transcontinental railroad routes throughout the country . The Democratic Party had long rejected federal appropriations for internal improvements , but Davis felt that such a project could be justified as a Constitutional national security objective . Davis also deployed the Army Corps of Engineers to supervise construction projects in the District of Columbia , including the expansion of the United States Capitol and building of the Washington Monument . 
 = = = Foreign and military affairs = = = 
 The Pierce administration fell in line with the expansionist Young America movement , with William L. Marcy leading the charge as Secretary of State . Marcy sought to present to the world a distinctively American , republican image . He issued a circular recommending that U.S. diplomats wear " the simple dress of an American citizen " instead of the elaborate diplomatic uniforms worn in the courts of Europe , and that they only hire American citizens to work in consulates . Marcy received international praise for his 73 @-@ page letter defending Austrian refugee Martin <unk> , who had been captured abroad in mid @-@ 1853 by the Austrian government despite his intention to become a U.S. citizen . 
 Davis , an advocate of a southern transcontinental route , persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate James Gadsden to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad . Gadsden was also charged with re @-@ negotiating the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory . Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna in December 1853 , purchasing a large swath of land to America 's southwest . Negotiations were nearly derailed by William Walker 's unauthorized expedition into Mexico , and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts . Congress reduced the Gadsden Purchase to the region now comprising southern Arizona and part of southern New Mexico ; the price was cut from $ 15 million to $ 10 million . Congress also included a protection clause for a private citizen , Albert G. Sloo , whose interests were threatened by the purchase . Pierce opposed the use of the federal government to prop up private industry and did not endorse the final version of the treaty , which was ratified nonetheless . The acquisition brought the contiguous United States to its present @-@ day boundaries , excepting later minor adjustments . 
 Relations with the United Kingdom were tense , as American fishermen felt menaced by the British navy 's increasing enforcement of Canadian waters . Marcy completed a trade reciprocity agreement with British minister to Washington , John Crampton , which would reduce the need for aggressive coastline enforcement . Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government , which was slow to support a new treaty . A favorable reciprocity treaty was ratified in August 1854 , which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada . While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canadian border , U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America , where the Clayton – Bulwer Treaty of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence . Gaining the advantage over Britain in the region was a key part of Pierce 's expansionist goals . 
 British consuls in the United States sought to enlist Americans for the Crimean War in 1854 , in violation of neutrality laws , and Pierce eventually expelled minister Crampton and three consuls . To the President 's surprise , the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation . In his December 1855 message to Congress Pierce had set forth the American case that Britain had violated the Clayton @-@ Bulwer Treaty . The British , according to Buchanan , were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy . Nevertheless , Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions . The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress , the British Parliament , and by the colonial legislatures in Canada . 
 Pierce 's administration aroused sectional apprehensions when three U.S. diplomats in Europe drafted a proposal to the president to purchase Cuba from Spain for $ 120 million ( USD ) , and justify the " wresting " of it from Spain if the offer were refused . The publication of the Ostend Manifesto , which had been drawn up at the insistence of Secretary of State Marcy , provoked the scorn of northerners who viewed it as an attempt to annex a slave @-@ holding possession to bolster Southern interests . It helped discredit the expansionist policy of Manifest Destiny the Democratic Party had often supported . 
 Pierce favored expansion and a substantial reorganization of the military . Secretary of War Davis and Navy Secretary James C. Dobbin found the Army and Navy in poor condition , with insufficient forces , a reluctance to adopt new technology , and inefficient management . Under the Pierce administration , Commodore Matthew C. Perry visited Japan ( a venture originally planned under Fillmore ) in an effort to expand trade to the East . Perry wanted to encroach on Asia by force , but Pierce and Dobbin pushed him to remain diplomatic . Perry signed a modest trade treaty with the Japanese shogunate which was successfully ratified . The 1856 launch of the USS Merrimac , one of six newly commissioned steam frigates , was one of Pierce 's " most personally satisfying " days in office .

 The greatest challenge to the country 's equilibrium during the Pierce administration was the passage of the Kansas – Nebraska Act . Organizing the largely unsettled Nebraska Territory , which stretched from Missouri to the Rocky Mountains , and from Texas north to what is now the Canadian border , was a crucial part of Douglas 's plans for western expansion . He wanted a transcontinental railroad with a link from Chicago to California , through the vast western territory . Organizing the territory was necessary for settlement as the land would not be surveyed nor put up for sale until a territorial government was authorized . Those from slave states had never been content with western limits on slavery , and felt it should be able to expand into territories procured with blood and treasure that had come , in part , from the South . Douglas and his allies planned to organize the territory and let local settlers decide whether to allow slavery . This would repeal the Missouri Compromise of 1820 , as most of it was north of the 36 ° 30 ′ N line the Missouri Compromise deemed " free " . The territory would be split into a northern part , Nebraska , and a southern part , Kansas , and the expectation was that Kansas would allow slavery and Nebraska would not . In the view of pro @-@ slavery Southern politicians , the Compromise of 1850 had already annulled the Missouri Compromise by admitting the state of California , including territory south of the compromise line , as a free state . 
 Pierce had wanted to organize the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery , but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this . Pierce was skeptical of the bill , knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North . Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless . It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator Salmon P. Chase and Massachusetts ' Charles Sumner , who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill . Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase , moves towards Cuba annexation , and the influence of slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis , and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression . The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce 's presidency . 
 Pierce and his administration used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board in favor of the bill . The Whigs split along sectional lines ; the conflict destroyed them as a national party . The Kansas – Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and would come to define the Pierce presidency . The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short @-@ term influence of the nativist and anti @-@ Catholic American Party , often called the Know Nothings , and the founding of the Republican Party . 
 Even as the act was being debated , settlers on both sides of the slavery issue poured into the territories so as to secure the outcome they wanted in the voting . The passage of the act resulted in so much violence between groups that the territory became known as Bleeding Kansas . Thousands of pro @-@ slavery Border Ruffians came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections although they were not resident in Kansas , giving that element the victory . Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities . When Free @-@ Staters set up a shadow government , and drafted the Topeka Constitution , Pierce called their work an act of rebellion . The president continued to recognize the pro @-@ slavery legislature , which was dominated by Democrats , even after a Congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate . He dispatched federal troops to break up a meeting of the Topeka government . 
 Passage of the act coincided with the seizure of escaped slave Anthony Burns in Boston . Northerners rallied in support of Burns , but Pierce was determined to follow the Fugitive Slave Act to the letter , and dispatched federal troops to enforce the return to his Virginia owner despite furious crowds . 
 The midterm congressional elections of 1854 and 1855 were devastating to the Democrats ( as well as to the Whig Party , which was on its last legs ) . The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South . The administration 's opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress , though only a few northern Whigs gained election . In Pierce 's New Hampshire , hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party , the Know @-@ Nothings elected the governor , all three representatives , dominated the legislature , and returned Hale to the Senate . Anti @-@ immigrant fervor brought the Know @-@ Nothings their highest numbers to that point , and some northerners were elected under the auspices of the new Republican Party . 
 = = = 1856 election = = = 
 Pierce fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats . In reality his chances of winning the nomination were slim , let alone re @-@ election . The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas – Nebraska Act , and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce 's electoral vulnerability . Nevertheless , his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination . Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce 's term , leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle . 
 When balloting began on June 5 at the convention in Cincinnati , Ohio , Pierce expected a plurality , if not the required two @-@ thirds majority . On the first ballot , he received only 122 votes , many of them from the South , to Buchanan 's 135 , with Douglas and Cass receiving the rest . By the following morning fourteen ballots had been completed , but none of the three main candidates were able to get two @-@ thirds of the vote . Pierce , whose support had been slowly declining as the ballots passed , directed his supporters to break for Douglas , withdrawing his name in a last @-@ ditch effort to defeat Buchanan . Douglas , only 43 years of age , believed that he could be nominated in 1860 if he let the older Buchanan win this time , and received assurances from Buchanan 's managers that this would be the case . After two more deadlocked ballots , Douglas 's managers withdrew his name , leaving Buchanan as the clear winner . To soften the blow to Pierce , the convention issued a resolution of " unqualified approbation " in praise of his administration and selected his ally , former Kentucky Representative John C. Breckinridge , as the vice @-@ presidential nominee . 
 Pierce endorsed Buchanan , though the two remained distant ; he hoped to resolve the Kansas situation by November to improve the Democrats ' chances in the general election . He installed John W. Geary as territorial governor , who drew the ire of pro @-@ slavery legislators . Geary was able to restore order in Kansas , though the electoral damage had already been done — Republicans used " Bleeding Kansas " and " Bleeding Sumner " ( the brutal caning of Charles Sumner by South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks in the Senate chamber ) as election slogans . The Buchanan / Breckinridge ticket was elected , but the Democratic percentage of the popular vote in the North fell from 49 @.@ 8 percent in 1852 to 41 @.@ 4 in 1856 as Buchanan won only five of sixteen free states ( Pierce had won fourteen ) , and in three of those , Buchanan won because of a split between the Republican candidate , former California senator John C. Frémont and the Know Nothing , former president Fillmore . 
 Pierce did not temper his rhetoric after losing the nomination . In his final message to Congress , delivered in December 1856 , he vigorously attacked Republicans and abolitionists . He took the opportunity to defend his record on fiscal policy , and on achieving peaceful relations with other nations . In the final days of the Pierce administration , Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers and to build new naval vessels , also expanding the number of seamen enlisted . It also passed a tariff reduction bill he had long sought . Pierce and his cabinet left office on March 4 , 1857 , the only time in U.S. history that the original cabinet members all remained for a full four @-@ year term .

 After leaving the White House , the Pierces remained in Washington for more than two months , staying with former Secretary of State Marcy . Buchanan altered course from the Pierce administration , replacing all of his appointees . The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth , New Hampshire , where Pierce had begun to speculate in property . Seeking warmer weather , he and Jane spent the next three years traveling , beginning with a stay in Madeira and followed by tours of Europe and the Bahamas . In Rome , he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne ; the two men spent much time together and the author found the retired president as buoyant as ever . 
 Pierce never lost sight of politics during his travels , commenting regularly on the nation 's growing sectarian conflict . He insisted that northern abolitionists stand down to avoid a southern secession , writing that the bloodshed of a civil war would " not be along Mason and Dixon 's line merely " , but " within our own borders in our own streets " . He also criticized New England Protestant ministers , who largely supported abolition and Republican candidates , for their " heresy and treason " . The rise of the Republican Party forced the Democrats to defend Pierce ; during his debates with Republican Senate candidate Abraham Lincoln in 1858 , Douglas called the former president " a man of integrity and honor " . 
 As the Democratic Convention of 1860 approached , some asked Pierce to run as a compromise candidate that could unite the fractured party , but Pierce refused . As Douglas struggled to attract southern support , Pierce backed Cushing and then Breckinridge as potential alternatives , but his priority was a united Democratic Party . The split Democrats were soundly defeated for the presidency by the Republican candidate , Lincoln . In the months between Lincoln 's election , and his inauguration on March 4 , 1861 , Pierce looked on as several southern states began plans to secede . He was asked by Justice Campbell to travel to Alabama and address that state 's secession convention . Due to illness he declined , but sent a letter appealing to the people of Alabama to remain in the Union , and give the North time to repeal laws against southern interests and to find common ground . 
 = = = Civil War = = = 
 After efforts to prevent the Civil War ended with the firing on Fort Sumter , Northern Democrats , including Douglas , endorsed Lincoln 's plan to bring the Southern states back into the fold by force . Pierce wanted to avoid war at all costs , and wrote to Van Buren , proposing an assembly of former U.S. presidents to resolve the issue , but this suggestion was not acted on . " I will never justify , sustain or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel , heartless , aimless , unnecessary war , " Pierce wrote to his wife . Pierce publicly opposed President Lincoln 's order suspending the writ of habeas corpus , arguing that even in a time of war , the country should not abandon its protection of civil liberties . This stand won him admirers with the emerging Northern Peace Democrats , but others saw the stand as further evidence of Pierce 's southern bias . 
 In September 1861 , Pierce traveled to Michigan , visiting his former Interior Secretary , McClelland , former senator Cass , and others . A Detroit bookseller , J. A. <unk> , sent a letter to Lincoln 's Secretary of State , William H. Seward , accusing the former president of meeting with disloyal people , and saying he had heard there was a plot to overthrow the government and establish Pierce as president . Later that month , the pro @-@ administration Detroit Tribune printed an item calling Pierce " a prowling traitor spy " , and intimating that he was a member of the pro @-@ Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle . No such conspiracy existed , but a Pierce supporter , Guy S. Hopkins , sent to the Tribune a letter purporting to be from a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle , indicating that " President P. " was part of a plot against the Union . Hopkins intended for the Tribune to make the charges public , at which point Hopkins would admit authorship , thus making the Tribune editors seem overly partisan and gullible . Instead , the Tribune editors forwarded the Hopkins letter to government officials . Seward then ordered the arrest of possible " traitors " in Michigan , which included Hopkins . Hopkins confessed authorship of the letter and admitted the hoax , but despite this , Seward wrote to Pierce demanding to know if the charges were true . Pierce denied them , and Seward hastily backtracked . Later , Republican newspapers printed the Hopkins letter in spite of his admission that it was a hoax , and Pierce decided that he needed to clear his name publicly . When Seward refused to make their correspondence public , Pierce publicized his outrage by having a Senate ally , California 's Milton Latham , read the letters between Seward and Pierce into the Congressional record , to the administration 's embarrassment . 
 The institution of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti @-@ administration Democrat Clement Vallandigham further incensed Pierce , who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln . " Who , I ask , has clothed the President with power to dictate to any one of us when we must or when we may speak , or be silent upon any subject , and especially in relation to the conduct of any public servant ? " , he demanded . Pierce 's comments were ill @-@ received in much of the North , especially as his criticism of Lincoln 's aims coincided with the twin Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg . Pierce 's reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president , Jefferson Davis , was seized by Union soldiers . Pierce 's correspondence with Davis , all pre @-@ war , revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North , was sent to the press . Pierce 's words hardened abolitionist sentiment against him . 
 Jane Pierce died of tuberculosis in Andover , Massachusetts in December 1863 ; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord , New Hampshire . Pierce was further grieved by his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne 's death in May 1864 ; he was with Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly . Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce . Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce 's name up for consideration as the 1864 presidential election unfolded , but he kept his distance ; Lincoln easily won a second term . When news spread of Lincoln 's assassination in April 1865 , a mob gathered outside Pierce 's home in Concord , demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture . Pierce grew angry , expressing sadness over Lincoln 's death but denying any need for a public gesture . He told them that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism , which was enough to quiet the crowd . 
 = = = Final years and death = = = 
 Pierce 's drinking worsened his health in his last years , and he grew increasingly spiritual . He had a brief relationship with an unknown woman in mid @-@ 1865 . During this time , he used his influence to improve the treatment of Davis , now a prisoner at Fortress Monroe in Virginia . He also offered financial help to Hawthorne 's son Julian , as well as to his own nephews . On the second anniversary of Jane 's death , Pierce was baptized into his wife 's Episcopal faith at St. Paul 's Church in Concord . He found this church to be less political than his former Congregational denomination , which had alienated Democrats with anti @-@ slavery rhetoric . He took up the life of an " old farmer " , as he called himself , buying up property , drinking less while farming it himself , and hosting visiting relatives . He spent most of his time in Concord and his cottage at Little Boar 's Head on the coast , sometimes visiting Jane 's relatives in Massachusetts . Still interested in politics , he expressed support for Andrew Johnson 's Reconstruction policy and supported the president 's acquittal in his impeachment trial ; he later expressed optimism for Johnson 's successor , Ulysses S. Grant . 
 Pierce 's health began to decline again in mid @-@ 1869 ; he resumed heavy drinking despite his deteriorating physical condition . He returned to Concord that September , suffering from severe cirrhosis of the liver , knowing he would not recover . A caretaker was hired ; none of his family members were present in his final days . He died at 4 : 35 am on October 8 . President Grant , who later defended Pierce 's service in the Mexican War , declared a day of national mourning . Newspapers across the country carried lengthy front @-@ page stories examining Pierce 's colorful and controversial career . Pierce was interred next to his wife and two of his sons in the Minot enclosure at Concord 's Old North Cemetery . 
 In his last will , which he signed January 22 , 1868 , Pierce left a large number of specific bequests such as paintings , swords , horses , and other items to friends , family , and neighbors . Much of his $ 72 @,@ 000 estate ( equal to $ 1 @,@ 280 @,@ 000 today ) went to his brother Henry 's family , and to Hawthorne 's children and Pierce 's landlady . Henry 's son Frank Pierce received the largest share .

 In addition to his LL.D. from Norwich University , Pierce also received honorary doctorates from Bowdoin College ( 1853 ) and Dartmouth College ( 1860 ) . 
 Two places in New Hampshire have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places specifically because of their association with Pierce . The Franklin Pierce Homestead in Hillsborough is a state park and a National Historic Landmark , open to the public . The Franklin Pierce House in Concord , where Pierce died , was destroyed by fire in 1981 , but is nevertheless listed on the register . The Pierce Manse , his Concord home from 1842 to 1848 , is open seasonally and maintained by a volunteer group , " The Pierce Brigade " . 
 Several institutions and places have been named after Pierce , mostly in New Hampshire . The Franklin Pierce University in Rindge , New Hampshire , was chartered in 1962 . The University of New Hampshire School of Law was founded in 1973 as the Franklin Pierce Law Center . When the school was renamed in 2010 , a Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property was established . There is a Mt . Pierce in the Presidential Range of New Hampshire 's White Mountains , renamed from Mt . Clinton in 1913 . The small town of <unk> , Indiana , was founded in the 1850s and honors President Pierce .

 After Pierce died , he mostly passed from the American consciousness , except as one of a series of presidents whose disastrous tenures led to civil war . Pierce 's presidency is widely regarded as a failure ; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history . The public placed him third @-@ to @-@ last among his peers in C @-@ SPAN surveys ( 2000 and 2009 ) . Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative , most disastrously with the Kansas – Nebraska Act . Although he did not lead that fight — Senator Douglas did — Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation . The failure of Pierce , as president , to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson , and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics . 
 Historian Eric Foner says , " His administration turned out to be one of the most disastrous in American history . It witnessed the collapse of the party system inherited from the Age of Jackson " 
 Biographer Roy Nichols argues : 
 As a national political leader Pierce was an accident . He was honest and tenacious of his views but , as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision , he gave a general impression of instability . Kind , courteous , generous , he attracted many individuals , but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies . In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners , who generally had the letter of the law on their side . He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution , as he described it , by the people of his own New England . At no time did he catch the popular imagination . His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers , especially in the North , and his few successes failed to restore public confidence . He was an inexperienced man , suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility , who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness . 
 Despite a reputation as an able politician and a likable man , during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war . To Pierce , who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality , the Union was sacred ; because of this , he saw the actions of abolitionists , and the more moderate Free Soilers , as divisive and as a threat to the constitutionally @-@ guaranteed rights of southerners . Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery , he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests . 
 David Potter concludes that the Ostend Manifesto and the Kansas – Nebraska Act were " the two great calamities of the Franklin Pierce administration ... Both brought down an avalanche of public criticism . " More important , says Potter , they permanently discredited Manifest Destiny and " popular sovereignty " as political doctrines . Historian Kenneth <unk> , writing in 2010 , takes a more favorable view of Pierce 's foreign policy , stating that his expansionism prefaced those of later presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt , who served at a time when America had the military might to make her desires stick . " American foreign and commercial policy beginning in the 1890s , which eventually supplanted European colonialism by the middle of the twentieth century , owed much to the paternalism of Jacksonian Democracy cultivated in the international arena by the Presidency of Franklin Pierce . " 
 Historian Larry Gara , who authored a book on Pierce 's presidency , wrote in the former president 's entry in American National Biography Online : 
 He was president at a time that called for almost superhuman skills , yet he lacked such skills and never grew into the job to which he had been elected . His view of the Constitution and the Union was from the Jacksonian past . He never fully understood the nature or depth of Free Soil sentiment in the North . He was able to negotiate a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada , to begin the opening of Japan to western trade , to add land to the Southwest , and to sign legislation for the creation of an overseas empire [ the Guano Islands Act ] . His Cuba and Kansas policies led only to deeper sectional strife . His support for the Kansas @-@ Nebraska Act and his determination to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act helped polarize the sections . Pierce was hard @-@ working and his administration largely untainted by graft , yet the legacy from those four turbulent years contributed to the tragedy of secession and civil war . 
 = National War Memorial ( South Australia ) = 
 The National War Memorial is a monument in the city centre of Adelaide , South Australia , commemorating those who served in the First World War . Opened in 1931 , the memorial is located on the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue , on the edge of the central business district and adjacent to the grounds of Government House . Memorial services are held at the site throughout the year , with major services on both Anzac Day ( 25 April ) and Remembrance Day ( 11 November ) . 
 First proposed in 1919 , the memorial was funded by the Parliament of South Australia , making it the first Australian state war memorial to be confirmed after the war . The design of the memorial was selected through two architectural competitions . The first competition , in 1924 , produced 26 designs — all of which were lost before judging could be completed after fire destroyed the building in which they were housed . A second competition , in 1926 , produced 18 entries , out of which the design by the architectural firm Woods , Bagot , Jory & Laybourne @-@ Smith was selected as the winner . 
 The design — effectively a frame for two scenes depicted through Rayner Hoff 's marble reliefs and bronze statues — shows the prelude and the epilogue to war , depicting both the willingness of youth to answer the call of duty and the extent of the sacrifices which they made . In this , the work is not displaying a material victory , but instead a victory of the spirit . At the insistence of W. F. J. McCann , president of the Returned Soldiers ' League , bronze tablets were cast to line the walls of an inner shrine , on which are listed the names of all South Australians who died during the Great War .

This number amounted to 8 @.@ 5 % of the South Australian population at the time , or 37 @.@ 7 % of men between the ages of 18 and 44 . Of those who served , over 5 @,@ 000 South Australians died . In response to these deaths , Archibald Peake , the premier of South Australia , asked the state parliament to fund a memorial commemorating the victory and the sacrifice of those who had fought and fallen . The motion was presented in March 1919 , and it received unanimous support in the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council . With the passing of this motion , the South Australian Government became the first in Australia to elect to build a memorial to the soldiers of the First World War . 
 It was decided by parliament that the new memorial should be referred to as the " National War Memorial " , even though it was to be a purely South Australian monument , and in spite of the term already being used to describe the memorial to the South African War of 1899 – 1902 . There have been at least two perspectives offered as to why the term National was employed . First , as Donald Richardson observed , the name may have been chosen to emphasise the government 's intention that the memorial should commemorate all who served during the war , not just those who came from South Australia ; and second , Ken Inglis argued that the name may have reflected the perception ( still held in spite of federation ) that the " province is a nation " . 
 = = = 1924 competition = = = 
 The National War Memorial Committee was formed in order to bring the proposal to fruition , and in February 1924 the committee announced an architectural competition to find the design of the new memorial . In the preamble to the conditions of entry , it was stated that the new memorial was to serve the purpose of " perpetually commemorating the Victory achieved in the Great War , 1914 – 1918 , the Supreme and personal sacrifice of those who participated in that War , and the National effort involved in such activities " . 
 Entry was open to South Australians who were British subjects , and those intending to submit designs were required to file a statement of intent prior to 29 February 1924 . The competition closed on 30 September 1924 , and there was a one @-@ guinea entry fee . Three assessors were nominated to judge the entries : the South Australian Architect @-@ in @-@ Chief , A. E. Simpson ; local architect Herbert Louis Jackman ( representing the South Australian Institute of Architects ) ; and Sir William Sowden . 
 The committee specified a budget of £ 25 @,@ 000 ( previously figures of both £ 5 @,@ 000 and £ 100 @,@ 000 had been discussed ) , and the conditions of entry stated that the memorial was to be situated at the entrance to Government House on the corner of King William Street and North Terrace , placing it just behind the existing memorial to the South African War . This location was counter to previous suggestions : a 1919 survey of architects had proposed that the memorial should be built on Montefiore Hill , while in 1923 the plans for the memorial involved erecting it at the rear of Government House , rather than at the front . 
 The committee left open the form that the memorial would take , beyond stating that the memorial was not to be " utilitarian in character " , and debate over the form led to the emergence of a number of suggestions , many of which were covered in the media of the day . These included Dame Nellie Melba 's proposal to build a carillon of bells ; a suggestion by Simpson Newland to turn Anzac Highway into a " Way of Honour " by adding triumphal arches to each end ; and Walter Charles <unk> 's plan to build a 30 meter high " metal and marble " monument on the top of Mount Lofty with an electric car to carry people to the summit . 
 In the end a total of 28 architectural firms registered their intent to submit entries to the competition — a lower number than expected , but Richardson suggests this may have been due to work on proposals for the new Adelaide railway station . Out of those 28 , a total of 26 firms submitted designs by the deadline . On 10 November 1924 , before judging could be completed , the Richards Building in Currie Street was destroyed by fire , taking with it all 26 proposals . 
 Although most of the judging had been completed before the fire , suggestions at the time that the committee could use what they had learned from the entrants to propose a new competition with greater clarity as to the requirements led to naught : a 1925 letter to the then Premier John Gunn reveals that there was little to be learned from the competition , as the assessors had found that none of the designs were suitable . 
 = = = 1926 competition = = = 
 Little progress had been made on the memorial by 1926 . While some debate occurred in respect to the form that the memorial would take , the focus of the discussions concerned the location of the memorial , and this centered on the future of Government House and the role of the Governor . A number of left @-@ wing politicians argued that the grounds of Government House should be turned over to the State and used to build the memorial while the conservatives desired to retain the status quo . By 1925 the National War Memorial committee was prepared to accept the Government House grounds as the site of the memorial , but they delayed making an announcement . This proved to be fortuitous , as legal issues prevented the plan from going ahead . Instead a portion of the grounds , located at the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue , was put aside for the purpose . ( The plan to move the Governor and to use the grounds as part of a larger war memorial were revisited , over 80 years later , in 2007 ) . 
 In 1926 , after pressure from the returned soldiers , a second competition was announced . Once again the budget was set at £ 25 @,@ 000 . As per the first competition , all entrants had to be South Australian British subjects , and all entries were to be judged anonymously , but this time there was to be only one assessor : John Smith Murdoch , the chief architect for the Commonwealth of Australia . In deference to the previous competition , the top five entrants from 1924 were each given £ 75 upon the submission of a new design , and all of the designs were insured by the government for £ 100 each . 
 With entries restricted to South Australians , only 18 designs were received — a figure that was " correspondingly fewer " than those received in other states where the competitions were open to all Australians . Nevertheless , in his Assessor 's Report , Murdoch acknowledged that the quality of some of the proposals was such that they " probably would not have been exceeded had the competition been more open " . After examining the submissions , on 15 January 1927 , the design by Louis Laybourne Smith , ( one of the principals at the architectural firm Woods , Bagot , Jory & Laybourne – Smith ) , was selected by Murdoch as the winner . 
 Woods , Bagot , Jory & Laybourne @-@ Smith had entered the 1924 competition with an arch designed by Walter Bagot , but in 1926 Bagot was away in Europe . Thus Laybourne @-@ Smith was responsible for drawing and submitting the final design , although he was clear to highlight the role Bagot played in the " architectural conception " of the monument . While the firm was to be awarded 6 % of the cost of the memorial , they refused all but enough to cover their own expenses , asking instead that residues ( approximately £ 1000 ) be placed in a trust fund to pay for the upkeep of the work . While this is seen as an altruistic act , Richardson noted that Laybourne @-@ Smith was both a member of the National War Committee and sat on the sub @-@ committee which drafted the rules of the competition , and thus it may have been considered " improper " to accept the money . 
 When announced to the public the design was " universally hailed as a masterpiece " . Nevertheless , in writing his report on the result of the judging , Murdoch stated of the winning architect that he " depends almost entirely on the sculptor to tell the story of the memorial , employing in his design no more architecture than that required to successfully frame and set his sculptural subjects , and to provide accommodation to the extent asked for by the conditions " . This view was echoed by Inglis , who described the architecture as " essentially a frame for statuary " — an approach that he felt was " unusual " for an architect . As a result of this dependency on the sculpture , some of the other contestants expressed concerns , arguing that the contest was about architectural works rather than sculptural ones , even though the conditions of the competition specifically allowed for sculpture in the proposals . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Construction of the memorial began in 1928 with the cut and placement of marble blocks from Macclesfield and Angaston . The South Australian Monumental Works were chosen to work on the construction , with Alan Tillett as the principal . Although no sculptor was named in the winning proposal , it did make mention of a possible candidate — who later proved to be Rayner Hoff , a Sydney @-@ based sculptor born in England . Rayner Hoff produced the designs for the sculptures from his Sydney studio , with the bronze castings from Hoff 's plaster models being produced by the South Australian firm A. W. Dobbie and Company . ( Hoff had expressed reservations that a South Australian company would be capable of handling bronzes of the required size , but a test casting of the lion 's head from the memorial was sufficient to overcome his concerns ) . The two angel reliefs sculpted from the Angaston marble were produced by Julius Henschke in situ from Hoff 's designs , expressed through one @-@ third sized plaster models which Henschke then scaled to suit . 
 Significant delays occurred during construction after a strike by the stonemasons . The stonemasons were demanding a 44 @-@ hour week and to be paid at " outside rates " , ( rates of pay for stonemasons were based on whether or not the work was to be constructed on site in the open air , or inside under cover — Tillet was paying the lower " inside rates " , even though most of the work was to be conducted on the site ) . However , Tillet had tendered on the basis of a 48 @-@ hour week at inside rates , and paying extra would have caused significant financial problems . Tillet eventually won after the dispute went before the courts , but the strike had caused considerable financial damage to Tillet 's company , which went into receivership in 1930 and stayed in that state until after the memorial was completed . 
 The South Australian Government had dedicated £ 25 @,@ 000 for the memorial . It was estimated that bulk of the expense would be masonry at £ 15 @,@ 300 with sculptural work and landscaping requiring £ 8 @,@ 500 and £ 1 @,@ 200 respectively . However , the final cost of construction pushed this out to approximately £ 30 @,@ 000 .

 The National War Memorial in South Australia became the fourth state World War I memorial to be opened when it was unveiled in 1931 . Inglis notes that this is in keeping with the size of the constituency , arguing that " [ t ] he larger the constituency that each of these collective tributes had to represent , the later it was built " . It was unveiled before a crowd of almost 75 @,@ 000 on Anzac Day , 25 April 1931 , ( the 16th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing ) , by the Governor Sir Alexander Hore @-@ Ruthven . The crowd , " as huge a crowd as anyone could remember assembling in the city " , was unable to fit in front of the memorial , so many thousands assembled at the Cross of Sacrifice in Pennington Gardens to await a later ceremony . Hore @-@ Ruthven was introduced by the acting state premier , Bill Denny MC , whose involvement in the unveiling , according to Inglis , was unusual for a Labor politician .

 In 2001 , the memorial 's 70th anniversary year , a three @-@ month remedial project was undertaken , restoring the bronze and stonework details and reinforcing the foundations .

In 2002 the architects responsible for the restoration , Bruce Harry & Associates , were awarded a Heritage merit award for their work on the memorial by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects .

 The rules of the competition limited the space for the memorial to the " one half acre " of land that was excised from the grounds of Government House . The design submitted by Woods , Bagot , Jory & Laybourne Smith easily met this requirement , as the memorial was designed to fit on an ellipse with a major axis of 18 @.@ 3 m ( 60 ft ) in length and a minor axis of 15 @.@ 5 m ( 51 ft ) . Standing at a height of over 14 m ( 46 ft ) , the structure was carefully placed back from North Terrace to provide space for " public gatherings of a ceremonial nature " and to allow for the proposed widening of the street . 
 The monument has two sides , referred to by the architects as the reverse and the obverse of the work , which they likened to the two sides of a coin . These two aspects represent the prologue and the epilogue of war . Each side features a relief carved from Angaston marble and framed by the " rough @-@ hewn " arch carved out of marble from Macclesfield , while the granite steps leading up to the monument are constructed of Harcourt granite , as specified in the original proposal . ( The architects had preferred the local West Island granite , but acknowledged that the Harcourt granite was " the best available " unless the government would agree to reopen the quarry on West Island ) . The materials were chosen in order to provide continuity with Parliament House , located a short distance away along North Terrace . 
 To represent the prologue to the war , the obverse of the monument ( the side facing North Terrace ) features a relief of the Spirit of Duty appearing as a vision before the youth of South Australia , represented in the work by a sculptural group consisting of a girl , a student and a farmer abandoning the " symbols of their craft " . The three are depicted in normal dress , as they are not yet soldiers and are currently unprepared for the war that is to come , and they are facing away from the world as they look to the vision before them . In Bagot 's original plan , submitted for the 1924 competition , there was to be but a single nude figure kneeling before the vision ( for which Bagot posed while in Europe ) , but Laybourne @-@ Smith 's 1926 submission became grander in its scope . In addition , Bagot 's original designs were naturalistic , with the Spirit of Duty depicted as a female figure , but under Hoff 's direction the figure was changed to male , and the style of the reliefs was changed to Art Deco — a " radically new " art style for Australia at the time . Hoff , however , presented the sculptural group in the original naturalistic style , thus providing a " bridge between the Renaissance @-@ style architecture and the Art Deco of the reliefs " . 
 On the reverse side of the monument , facing away from the traffic , is a relief carved into the marble representing the epilogue of the war and depicting the Spirit of Compassion as a winged spirit of womanhood bearing aloft a stricken youth . Beneath the figure is situated the Fountain of Compassion , the flow of water representing the " constant flow of memories " , while the lion 's head from which it emerges , ( and which bears the Imperial Crown ) , is representative of the British Commonwealth of Nations . 
 The designers acknowledged that the symbolism — especially that of the reverse side — does not represent " victory " in the traditional sense . They stated that the " Arch of Triumph which was built in honour of a Caesar , a Napoleon , no longer expresses the feelings of modern democracy after an international struggle " . Instead , the memorial represented a spiritual victory , in which was displayed a " willingness to serve and to sacrifice " . 
 Within the memorial the architects added an inner shrine , or Record Room , in which could be recorded the names of the South Australians who fell during the war . While the design did not specify the exact form that this would take , in the completed memorial these names are inscribed in the bronzes that line the walls . The design also allowed for a cenotaph within the inner shrine , which the designers suggested could either be used as a symbolic representation of the unknown soldier or as the marker to an actual grave , although this aspect was never realised . 
 The monument is designed to honour both the war dead and all who served in the war — one face being inscribed to those who died in the war , while the other is dedicated to " all who served " . On the obverse side is inscribed the words " To perpetuate the courage , loyalty , and sacrifice of those who served in the Great War 1914 – 1918 " , while the reverse states " All honour give to those who , nobly striving , nobly fell that we might live " . Above the two entrances to the inner shrine were to be inscribed the names of the major theaters in which Australians served in the Great War . Originally it was suggested that this was to be Egypt , Gallipoli and Palestine on one side , with France on the other , but in the final work Belgium was added to the list . 
 Although the central square mile of the City of Adelaide is designed to the points of the compass , the monument sits at a 45 degree angle to North Terrace . The architects provided two reasons for this . First , it was observed that " monuments suffer materially from monotonous lighting " when they face to the south ; and second , the placing of the monument to face a north @-@ west direction allows it to be in line with both the Cross of Sacrifice and St. Peter 's Cathedral . In addition to these two arguments , Richardson also notes that the diagonal positioning of the memorial permits the dawn sun to fall on the facade .

 Although the National War Memorial was initially proposed as a memorial to those who served in " The Great War " , the site has since grown to incorporate a number of smaller memorials . These include a memorial to the Battle of Lone Pine ; the " French Memorial " , which commemorates those who fought and died in France during the first and second World Wars ; an honour roll of those who died in World War II ; and the " Australian Armed Forces Memorial " , encompassing the Malayan Emergency of 1948 – 1960 , the Korean War , the Indonesia @-@ Malaysia confrontation in Borneo , and the Vietnam War . In addition , the wall which surrounds the northern and western sides of the site features the six " Crosses of Memory " — a series of " simple wooden crosses " commemorating the Siege of Tobruk from 1941 and the 10th , 27th , 48th and 50th battalions of 1916 . 
 = History of the Great Wall of China = 
 The history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn ( 771 – 476 BC ) and Warring States periods ( 475 – 221 BC ) were connected by the first emperor of China , Qin Shi Huang , to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty ( 221 – 206 BC ) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia . The walls were built of rammed earth , constructed using forced labour , and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria . 
 Later dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense . The Han ( 202 BC – 220 AD ) , the Northern Qi ( 550 – 574 ) , the Sui ( 589 – 618 ) , and particularly the Ming ( 1369 – 1644 ) were among those that rebuilt , re @-@ manned , and expanded the Walls , although they rarely followed Qin 's routes . The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west , the Qi built about 1 @,@ 600 kilometres ( 990 mi ) of new walls , while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall @-@ building efforts . Conversely , the Tang ( 618 – 907 ) , the Song ( 960 – 1279 ) , the Yuan ( 1271 – 1368 ) , and the Qing ( 1644 – 1911 ) mostly did not build frontier walls , instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy . 
 Although a useful deterrent against raids , at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies , including in 1644 when the Manchu Qing marched through the gates of Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall @-@ building dynasties , the Ming , as rulers of China . 
 The Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty , as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick , often extending its line through challenging terrain . Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated , while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons , deconstructed for their building materials , or lost due to the ravages of time . For long an object of fascination for foreigners , the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination . 
 = = Geographical considerations = = 
 The conflict between the Chinese and the nomads , from which the need for the Great Wall arose , stemmed from differences in geography . The 15 " isohyet marks the extent of settled agriculture , dividing the fertile fields of China to the south and the semi @-@ arid grasslands of Inner Asia to the north . The climates and the topography of the two regions led to distinct modes of societal development . 
 According to the model by sinologist Karl August <unk> , the loess soils of Shaanxi made it possible for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on . Although this allowed them to expand into the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley , such extensive waterworks on an ever @-@ increasing scale required collective labour , something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy . Thus the scholar @-@ bureaucrats came to the fore to keep track of the income and expenses of the granaries . Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration ; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within . These cities combined to become feudal states , which eventually united to become an empire . Likewise , according to this model , walls not only enveloped cities as time went by , but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes . 
 The steppe societies of Inner Asia , whose climate favoured a pastoral economy , stood in stark contrast to the Chinese mode of development . As animal herds are migratory by nature , communities could not afford to be stationary and therefore evolved as nomads . According to the influential <unk> Owen Lattimore this lifestyle proved to be incompatible with the Chinese economic model . As the steppe population grew , pastoral agriculture alone could not support the population , and tribal alliances needed to be maintained by material rewards . For these needs , the nomads had to turn to the settled societies to get grains , metal tools , and luxury goods , which they could not produce by themselves . If denied trade by the settled peoples , the nomads would resort to raiding or even conquest . 
 Potential nomadic incursion from three main areas of Inner Asia caused concern to northern China : Mongolia to the north , Manchuria to the northeast , and Xinjiang to the northwest . Of the three , China 's chief concern since the earliest times had been Mongolia – the home of many of the country 's fiercest enemies including the Xiongnu , the Xianbei , the Khitans , and the Mongols . The Gobi Desert , which accounts for two @-@ thirds of Mongolia 's area , divided the main northern and southern grazing lands and pushed the pastoral nomads to the fringes of the steppe . On the southern side ( Inner Mongolia ) , this pressure brought the nomads into contact with China . 
 For the most part , barring intermittent passes and valleys ( the major one being the corridor through Zhangjiakou and the Juyong Pass ) , the North China Plain remained shielded from the Mongolian steppe by the Yin Mountains . However , if this defence were breached , China 's flat terrain offered no protection to the cities on the plain , including the imperial capitals of Beijing , Kaifeng , and Luoyang . Heading west along the Yin Mountains , the range ends where the Yellow River circles northwards upstream in the area known as the Ordos Loop – technically part of the steppe , but capable of irrigated agriculture . Although the Yellow River formed a theoretical natural boundary with the north , such a border so far into the steppe was difficult to maintain . The lands south of the Yellow River — the <unk> , the Ordos Desert , and the Loess Plateau — provided no natural barriers on the approach to the Wei River valley , the oft @-@ called cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital Xi 'an lay . As such , control of the Ordos remained extremely important for the rulers of China : not only for potential influence over the steppe , but also for the security of China proper . The region 's strategic importance combined with its untenability led many dynasties to place their first walls here . 
 Although Manchuria is home to the agricultural lands of the Liao River valley , its location beyond the northern mountains relegated it to the relative periphery of Chinese concern . When Chinese state control became weak , at various points in history Manchuria fell under the control of the forest peoples of the area , including the Jurchens and the Manchus . The most crucial route that links Manchuria and the North China Plain is a narrow coastal strip of land , wedged between the Bohai Sea and the Yan Mountains , called the Shanhai Pass ( literally the " mountain and sea pass " ) . The pass gained much importance during the later dynasties , when the capital was set in Beijing , a mere 300 kilometres ( 190 mi ) away . In addition to the Shanhai Pass , a handful of mountain passes also provide access from Manchuria into China through the Yan Mountains , chief among them the Gubeikou and <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ) . 
 Xinjiang , considered part of the Turkestan region , consists of an amalgamation of deserts , oases , and dry steppe barely suitable for agriculture . When influence from the steppe powers of Mongolia waned , the various Central Asian oasis kingdoms and nomadic clans like the Göktürks and Uyghurs were able to form their own states and confederations that threatened China at times . China proper is connected to this area by the Hexi Corridor , a narrow string of oases bounded by the Gobi Desert to the north and the high Tibetan Plateau to the south . In addition to considerations of frontier defence , the Hexi Corridor also formed an important part of the Silk Road trade route . Thus it was also in China 's economic interest to control this stretch of land , and hence the Great Wall 's western terminus is in this corridor — the Yumen Pass during Han times and the Jiayu Pass during the Ming dynasty and thereafter . 
 = = Pre @-@ Imperial China ( 7th century – 221 BC ) = = 
 One of the first mentions of a wall built against northern invaders is found in a poem , dated from the seventh century BC , recorded in the Classic of Poetry . The poem tells of a king , now identified as King Xuan ( r . 827 – 782 BC ) of the Western Zhou dynasty ( 1046 – 771 BC ) , who commanded General Nan Zhong ( <unk> ) to build a wall in the northern regions to fend off the <unk> . The <unk> , whose base of power was in the Ordos region , were regarded as part of the <unk> Rong tribes , and their attacks aimed at the early Zhou capital region of <unk> were probably the reason for King Xuan 's response . Nan Zhong 's campaign was recorded as a great victory . However , only a few years later in 771 BC another branch of the Rong people , the <unk> , responded to a summons by the renegade Marquess of Shen by over @-@ running the Zhou defences and laying waste to the capital . The cataclysmic event killed King Xuan 's successor King You ( 795 – 771 BC ) , forced the court to move the capital east to <unk> ( <unk> , later known as Luoyang ) a year later , and thus ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty ( 770 – 256 BC ) . Most importantly , the fall of Western Zhou redistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou 's nominal rulership . The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody interstate anarchy . With smaller states being annexed and larger states waging constant war upon one another , many rulers came to feel the need to erect walls to protect their borders . Of the earliest textual reference to such a wall was the State of Chu 's wall of 656 BC , 1 @,@ 400 metres ( 4 @,@ 600 ft ) of which were excavated in southern Henan province in the modern era . The State of Qi also had fortified borders up by the 7th century BC , and the extant portions in Shandong province had been christened the Great Wall of Qi . The State of Wei built two walls , the western one completed in 361 BC and the eastern in 356 BC , with the extant western wall found in <unk> , Shaanxi . Even non @-@ Chinese peoples built walls , such as the Di state of Zhongshan and the Yiqu Rong ( <unk> ) , whose walls were intended to defend against the State of Qin . 
 Of these walls , those of the northern states Yan , Zhao , and Qin were connected by Qin Shi Huang when he united the Chinese states in 221 BC . 
 The State of Yan , the easternmost of the three northern states , began to erect walls after the general Qin Kai drove the <unk> people back " a thousand li " during the reign of King Zhao ( <unk> ; r . 311 – 279 BC ) . The Yan wall stretched from the Liaodong peninsula , through <unk> , and into northern Hebei , possibly bringing its western terminus near the Zhao walls . Another Yan wall was erected to the south to defend against the Zhao ; it was southwest of present @-@ day Beijing and ran parallel to the Juma River for several dozen miles . 
 The Zhao walls to the north were built under King Wuling of Zhao ( r . 325 – 299 BC ) , whose groundbreaking introduction of nomadic cavalry into his army reshaped Chinese warfare and gave Zhao an initial advantage over his opponents . He attacked the Xiongnu tribes of <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) to the north , then waged war on the state of Zhongshan until it was annexed in 296 BC . In the process , he constructed the northernmost fortified frontier deep in nomadic territory . The Zhao walls were dated in the 1960s to be from King Wuling 's reign : a southern long wall in northern Henan encompassing the Yanmen Pass ; a second line of barricades encircling the Ordos Loop , extending from Zhangjiakou in the east to the ancient fortress of <unk> ( <unk> ) in the <unk> Front Banner ; and a third , northernmost line along the southern slopes of the Yin Mountains , extending from Qinghe in the east , passing north of <unk> , and into <unk> . 
 Qin was originally a state on the western fringe of the Chinese political sphere , but it grew into a formidable power in the later parts of the Warring States period when it aggressively expanded in all directions . In the north , the state of Wei and the Yiqu built walls to protect themselves from Qin aggression , but were still unable to stop Qin from eating into their territories . The Qin reformist Shang Yang forced the Wei out of their walled area west of the Yellow River in 340 BC , and King <unk> of Qin ( r . 338 – 311 BC ) took 25 Yiqu forts in a northern offensive . When King <unk> died , his widow the Queen Dowager Xuan ( <unk> ) acted as regent because the succeeding sons were deemed too young to govern . During the reign of King <unk> ( r . 306 – 251 BC ) , the queen dowager apparently entered illicit relations with the Yiqu king and gave birth to two of his sons , but later tricked and killed the Yiqu king . Following that coup , the Qin army marched into Yiqu territory at the queen dowager 's orders ; the Qin annihilated the Yiqu remnants and thus came to possess the Ordos region . At this point the Qin built a wall around their new territories to defend against the true nomads even further north , incorporating the Wei walls . As a result , an estimated total of 1 @,@ 775 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 103 mi ) of Qin walls ( including spurts ) extended from southern Gansu to the bank of the Yellow River in the <unk> Banner , close to the border with Zhao at the time . 
 The walls , known as <unk> ( <unk> ) – literally " long walls " , but often translated as " Great Wall " – were mostly constructed of tamped earth , with some parts built with stones . Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre @-@ existing or conquered barbarian societies . It is entirely possible , as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest , that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period . 
 = = Qin dynasty ( 221 – 206 BC ) = = 
 In 221 BC , the state of Qin completed its conquest over the other Warring States and united China under Qin Shi Huang , the first emperor of China . These conquests , combined with the Legalist reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th century BC , transformed China from a loose confederation of feudal states to an authoritarian empire . With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders . Once the Xiongnu were chased away , Meng Tian introduced 30 @,@ 000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories . 
 Wall configurations were changed to reflect the new borders under the Qin . General Meng Tian erected walls beyond the northern loop of the Yellow River , effectively linking the border walls of Qin , Zhao , and Yan . Concurrent to the building of the frontier wall was the destruction of the walls within China that used to divide one warring state from another — contrary to the outer walls , which were built to stabilize the newly united China , the inner walls threatened the unity of the empire . In the following year , 214 BC , Qin Shi Huang ordered new fortifications to be built along the Yellow River to the west of the Ordos while work continued in the north . This work was completed probably by 212 BC , signalled by Qin Shi Huang 's imperial tour of inspection and the construction of the Direct Road ( <unk> ) connecting the capital Xianyang with the Ordos . The result was a series of long walls running from Gansu to the seacoast in Manchuria . 
 Details of the construction were not found in the official histories , but it could be inferred that the construction conditions were made especially difficult by the long stretches of mountains and semi @-@ desert that the Great Wall traversed , the sparse populations of these areas , and the frigid winter climate . Although the walls were rammed earth , so the bulk of the building material could be found in situ , transportation of additional supplies and labour remained difficult for the reasons named above . The sinologist Derk <unk> posits in The Cambridge History of China that " for every man whom Meng Tian could put to work at the scene of actual construction , dozens must have been needed to build approaching roads and to transport supplies . " This is supported by the Han dynasty statesman <unk> Yan 's description of Qin Shi Huang 's Ordos project in 128 BC : 
 ... the land was brackish and arid , crops could not be grown on them . ... At the time , the young men being drafted were forced to haul boats and barges loaded with baggage trains upstream to sustain a steady supply of food and fodder to the front . ... Commencing at the departure point a man and his animal could carry thirty <unk> ( about 176 kilograms ( 388 lb ) ) of food supply , by the time they arrived at the destination , they merely delivered one dan ( about 29 kilograms ( 64 lb ) ) of supply . ... When the populace had become tired and weary they started to dissipate and abscond . The orphans , the frail , the widowed and the seniors were desperately trying to escape from their appallingly derelict state and died on the wayside as they wandered away from their home . People started to revolt . 
 The settlement of the north continued up to Qin Shi Huang 's death in 210 BC , upon which Meng Tian was ordered to commit suicide in a succession conspiracy . Before killing himself , Meng Tian expressed regret for his walls : " Beginning at <unk> and reaching to Liaodong , I built walls and dug moats for more than ten thousand li ; was it not inevitable that I broke the earth 's veins along the way ? This then was my offense . " 
 Meng Tian 's settlements in the north were abandoned , and the Xiongnu nomads moved back into the Ordos Loop as the Qin empire became consumed by widespread rebellion due to public discontent . Owen Lattimore concluded that the whole project relied upon military power to enforce agriculture on a land more suited for herding , resulting in " the anti @-@ historical paradox of attempting two mutually exclusive forms of development simultaneously " that was doomed to fail . 
 = = Han dynasty ( 206 BC – 220 AD ) = = 
 In 202 BC , the former peasant Liu Bang emerged victorious from the Chu – Han Contention that followed the rebellion that toppled the Qin dynasty , and proclaimed himself Emperor of the Han dynasty , becoming known as Emperor Gaozu of Han ( r . 202 – 195 BC ) to posterity . Unable to address the problem of the resurgent Xiongnu in the Ordos region through military means , Emperor Gaozu was forced to appease the Xiongnu . In exchange for peace , the Han offered tributes along with princesses to marry off to the Xiongnu chiefs . These diplomatic marriages would become known as heqin , and the terms specified that the Great Wall ( determined to be either the Warring States period Qin state wall or a short stretch of wall south of Yanmen Pass ) was to serve as the line across which neither party would venture . In 162 BC , Gaozu 's son Emperor Wen clarified the agreement , suggesting the Xiongnu chanyu held authority north of the Wall and the Han emperor held authority south of it . Sima Qian , the author of the Records of the Grand Historian , describes the result of this agreement as one of peace and friendship : " from the chanyu downwards , all the Xiongnu grew friendly with the Han , coming and going along the Long Wall " . However , Chinese records show that the Xiongnu often did not respect the agreement , as the Xiongnu cavalry numbering up to 100 @,@ 000 made several intrusions into Han territory despite the intermarriage . 
 To Chinese minds , the heqin policy was humiliating and ran contrary to the <unk> world order like " a person hanging upside down " , as the statesman Jia Yi ( d . 169 BC ) puts it . These sentiments manifested themselves in the Han court in the form of the pro @-@ war faction , who advocated the reversal of Han 's policy of appeasement . By the reign of Emperor Wu ( r . 141 – 87 BC ) , the Han felt comfortable enough to go to war with the Xiongnu . After a botched attempt at luring the Xiongnu army into an ambush at the Battle of Mayi in 133 BC , the era of heqin @-@ style appeasement was broken and the Han – Xiongnu War went into full swing . 
 As the Han – Xiongnu War progressed in favour of the Han , the Wall became maintained and extended beyond Qin lines . In 127 BC , General Wei Qing invaded the much @-@ contested Ordos region as far as the Qin fortifications set up by Meng Tian . In this way , Wei Qing reconquered the irrigable lands north of the Ordos and restored the spur of defences protecting that territory from the steppe . In addition to rebuilding the walls , archeologists believe that the Han also erected thousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor Wu 's reign . The fortifications here include embankments , beacon stations , and forts , all constructed with a combination of tamped @-@ earth cores and stone frontages . From the Ordos Loop , the sporadic and non @-@ continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei , <unk> , and Jiuquan , leading into the Juyan Lake Basin , and terminating in two places : the Yumen Pass in the north , or the Yang Pass to the south , both in the vicinity of Dunhuang . Yumen Pass was the most westerly of all Han Chinese fortifications – further west than the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall at Jiayu Pass , about 460 kilometres ( 290 mi ) to the east . The garrisons of the watchtowers on the wall were supported by civilian farming and by military agricultural colonies known as <unk> . Behind this line of fortifications , the Han government was able to maintain its settlements and its communications to the Western Regions in central Asia , generally secure from attacks from the north . 
 The campaigns against the Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples of the west exhausted the imperial treasury , and the expansionist policies were reverted in favour of peace under Emperor Wu 's successors . The peace was largely respected even when the Han throne was usurped by the minister Wang Mang in 9 AD , beginning a brief 15 @-@ year interregnum known as the Xin dynasty ( 9 – 23 ) . Despite high tensions between the Xin and the Xiongnu resulting in the deployment of 300 @,@ 000 men on the Great Wall , no major fighting broke out beyond minor raids . Instead , popular discontent led to banditry and , ultimately , full @-@ scale rebellion . The civil war ended with the Liu clan on the throne again , beginning the Eastern Han dynasty ( 25 – 220 ) . 
 The restorer Emperor Guangwu ( r . 25 – 57 AD ) initiated several projects to consolidate his control within the frontier regions . Defense works were established to the east of the Yanmen Pass , with a line of fortifications and beacon fires stretching from Pingcheng County ( present @-@ day Datong ) through the valley of the <unk> River to Dai County , Shanxi . By 38 AD , as a result of raids by the Xiongnu further to the west against the Wei River valley , orders were given for a series of walls to be constructed as defences for the Fen River , the southward course of the Yellow River , and the region of the former imperial capital , Chang 'an . These constructions were defensive in nature , which marked a shift from the offensive walls of the preceding Emperor Wu and the rulers of the Warring States . By the early 40s AD the northern frontiers of China had undergone drastic change : the line of the imperial frontier followed not the advanced positions conquered by Emperor Wu but the rear defences indicated roughly by the modern ( Ming dynasty ) Great Wall . The Ordos region , northern Shanxi , and the upper Luan River basin around Chengde were abandoned and left to the control of the Xiongnu . The rest of the frontier remained somewhat intact until the end of the Han dynasty , with the Dunhuang manuscripts ( discovered in 1900 ) indicating that the military establishment in the northwest was maintained for most of the Eastern Han period .

 Following the end of the Han dynasty in 220 , China disintegrated into warlord states , which in 280 were briefly reunited under the Western Jin dynasty ( 265 – 316 ) . There are ambiguous accounts of the Jin rebuilding the Qin wall , but these walls apparently offered no resistance during the Wu Hu uprising , when the nomadic tribes of the steppe evicted the Chinese court from northern China . What followed was a succession of short @-@ lived states in northern China known as the Sixteen Kingdoms , until they were all consolidated by the Xianbei @-@ led Northern Wei dynasty ( 386 – 535 ) . 
 As Northern Wei became more economically dependent on agriculture , the Xianbei emperors made a conscious decision to adopt Chinese customs , including passive methods of frontier defence . In 423 , a defence line over 2 @,@ 000 li ( 1 @,@ 080 kilometres ( 670 mi ) ) long was built to resist the Rouran ; its path roughly followed the old Zhao wall from <unk> County in Hebei Province to Wuyuan County , Inner Mongolia . In 446 , 100 @,@ 000 men were put to work building an inner wall from Yanqing , passing south of the Wei capital Pingcheng , and ending up near <unk> on the eastern bank of the Yellow River . The two walls formed the basis of the double @-@ layered Xuanfu – Datong wall system that protected Beijing a thousand years later during the Ming dynasty . 
 The Northern Wei collapsed in 535 due to civil insurrection to be eventually succeeded by the Northern Qi ( 550 – 575 ) and Northern Zhou ( 557 – 580 ) . Faced with the threat of the Göktürks from the north , from 552 to 556 the Qi built up to 3 @,@ 000 li ( about 1 @,@ 600 kilometres ( 990 mi ) ) of wall from Shanxi to the sea at Shanhai Pass . Over the course of the year 555 alone , 1 @.@ 8 million men were mobilized to build the Juyong Pass and extend its wall by 450 kilometres ( 280 mi ) through Datong to the eastern banks of the Yellow River . In 557 a secondary wall was built inside the main one . These walls were built quickly from local earth and stones or formed by natural barriers . Two stretches of the stone @-@ and @-@ earth Qi wall still stand in Shanxi today , measuring 3 @.@ 3 metres ( 11 ft ) wide at their bases and 3 @.@ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) high on average . In 577 the Northern Zhou conquered the Northern Qi and in 580 made repairs to the existing Qi walls . The route of the Qi and Zhou walls would be mostly followed by the later Ming wall west of Gubeikou , which includes reconstructed walls from Qi and Zhou . In more recent times , the reddish remnants of the Zhou ramparts in Hebei gave rise to the nickname " Red Wall " . 
 The Sui took power from the Northern Zhou in 581 before reuniting China in 589 . Sui 's founding emperor , Emperor Wen of Sui ( r . 581 – 604 ) , carried out considerable wall construction in 581 in Hebei and Shanxi to defend against <unk> Qaghan of the Göktürks . The new walls proved insufficient in 582 when <unk> Qaghan avoided them by riding west to raid Gansu and Shaanxi with 400 @,@ 000 archers . Between 585 and 588 Emperor Wen sought to close this gap by putting walls up in the Ordos Mountains ( between <unk> and <unk> ) and Inner Mongolia . In 586 as many as 150 @,@ 000 men are recorded as involved in the construction . Emperor Wen 's son Emperor Yang ( r . 604 – 618 ) continued to build walls . In 607 – 8 he sent over a million men to build a wall from Yulin to near <unk> to protect the newly refurbished eastern capital Luoyang . Part of the Sui wall survives to this day in Inner Mongolia as earthen ramparts some 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 ft 2 in ) high with towers rising to double that . The dynastic history of Sui estimates that 500 @,@ 000 people died building the wall , adding to the number of casualties caused by Emperor Yang 's projects including the aforementioned redesign of Luoyang , the Grand Canal , and two ill @-@ fated campaigns against Goguryeo . With the economy strained and the populace resentful , the Sui dynasty erupted in rebellion and ended with the assassination of Emperor Yang in 618 . 
 = = Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) = = 
 Frontier policy under the Tang dynasty reversed the wall @-@ building activities of most previous dynasties that had occupied northern China since the third century BC , and no extensive wall building took place for the next several hundred years . 
 Soon after the establishment of the Tang dynasty , during the reign of Emperor Taizong ( r . 626 – 649 ) , the threat of Göktürk tribesmen from the north prompted some court officials to suggest drafting corvée labourers to repair the aging Great Wall . Taizong scoffed at the suggestion , alluding to the Sui walls built in vain : " The Emperor Yang of Sui made the people labor to construct the Great Wall in order to defend against the Turks , but in the end this was of no use . " Instead of building walls , Taizong claimed he " need merely to establish Li Shiji in <unk> for the dust on the border to settle . " Accordingly , Taizong sent talented generals like Li Shiji with mobile armies to the frontier , while fortifications were mostly limited to a series of walled garrisons , such as the euphemistically @-@ named " cities for accepting surrender " ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) that were actually bases from which to launch attacks . As a result of this military strategy , the Tang grew to become one of the largest of all the Chinese empires , destroying the Göktürks of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate and acquiring territory stretching all the way to Kazakhstan . 
 Nevertheless , records show that in the Kaiyuan era ( 713 – 742 ) of Emperor Xuanzong 's reign , the general Zhang Yue built a wall 90 li ( 48 kilometres ( 30 mi ) ) to the north of <unk> ( <unk> ; present @-@ day <unk> County , Hebei ) , although it remains unclear whether he erected new walls or only reinforced the existing Northern Qi walls . 
 The Great Wall , or the ruins of it , features prominently in the subset of Tang poetry known as <unk> shi ( <unk> , " frontier verse " ) written by scholar @-@ officials assigned along the frontier . Emphasizing the poets ' loneliness and longing for home while hinting at the pointlessness of their posts , these frontier verses are characterized by imagery of desolate landscapes , including the ruins of the now @-@ neglected Great Wall — a direct product of Tang 's frontier policy .

 = = = The northern walls of the Khitan , Jurchens , and Tanguts = = = 
 After the Tang dynasty ended in 907 , the northern frontier area remained out of Han Chinese hands until the establishment of the Ming dynasty in 1368 . During this period , non @-@ Han " conquest dynasties " ruled the north : the Khitan Liao dynasty ( 907 – 1125 ) and the succeeding Jurchen Jin dynasty ( 1115 – 1234 ) in the east and the Tangut Western Xia ( 1038 – 1227 ) in the west , all of which had built walls against the north . 
 In 907 , the Khitan chieftain Abaoji succeeded in getting himself appointed khaghan of all Khitan tribes in the north , laying the foundations to what would officially become the Liao dynasty . In 936 , the Khitan supported the Shanxi rebel Shi Jingtang in his revolt against the Shatuo Turkic Later Tang , which had destroyed the usurpers of the Tang in 923 . The Khitan leader , Abaoji 's second son Yelü Deguang , convinced Shi to found a new dynasty ( the Later Jin , 936 – 946 ) , and received the crucial border region known as the Sixteen Prefectures in return . With the Sixteen Prefectures , the Khitan now possessed all the passes and fortifications that controlled access to the plains of northern China , including the main Great Wall line . 
 Settling in the transitional area between agricultural lands and the steppe , the Khitans became semi @-@ sedentary like their Xianbei predecessors of the Northern Wei , and started to use Chinese methods of defence . In 1026 walls were built through central Manchuria north of Nong 'an County to the banks of the <unk> River . When the Jurchens , once Liao vassals , rose up to overthrow their masters and established the Jin dynasty , they continued Liao 's wall @-@ building activities with extensive work begun before 1138 . Further wall construction took place in 1165 and 1181 under the Jin Emperor Shizhong , and later from 1192 to 1203 during the reign of his successor Emperor Zhangzong . 
 This long period of wall @-@ building burdened the populace and provoked controversy . Sometime between 1190 and 1196 , during Zhangzong 's reign , the high official Zhang <unk> ( <unk> ) and the Censorate recommended that work on the wall be indefinitely suspended due to a recent drought , noting : " What has been begun is already being flattened by sandstorms , and bullying the people into defence works will simply exhaust them . " However , Chancellor Wanyan Xiang ( <unk> ) convinced the emperor of the walls ' merits based on an optimistic cost estimate – " Although the initial outlay for the walls will be one million strings of cash , when the work is done the frontier will be secure with only half the present number of soldiers needed to defend it , which means that every year you will save three million strings of cash ... The benefits will be everlasting " – and so construction continued unabated . All this work created an extensive systems of walls , which consisted of a 700 kilometres ( 430 mi ) " outer wall " from Heilongjiang to Mongolia and a 1 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) network of " inner walls " north and northeast of Beijing . Together , they formed a roughly elliptical web of fortifications 1 @,@ 400 kilometres ( 870 mi ) in length and 440 kilometres ( 270 mi ) in diameter . Some of these walls had inner moats ( from 10 to 60 metres ( 33 to 197 ft ) in width ) , beacon towers , battlements , parapets , and outward @-@ facing semicircular platforms protruding from the wall — features that set the Jin walls apart from their predecessors . 
 In the west , the Tanguts took control of the Ordos region , where they established the Western Xia dynasty . Although the Xia were not traditionally known for building walls , in 2011 archeologists uncovered 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of walls at Ömnögovi Province in Mongolia in what had been Western Xia territory . Radiocarbon analysis showed that they were constructed from 1040 to 1160 . The walls were as tall as 2 @.@ 75 metres ( 9 ft 0 in ) at places when they were discovered , and may have been around 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) taller originally . They were built with mud and saxaul ( a desert shrub ) in one section , and dark basalt blocks in another , suggesting that the rocks may have been quarried from nearby extinct volcanoes and transported to the construction site . Archaeologists have not yet found traces of human activity around this stretch of wall , which suggests that the Xia wall in this location may have been incomplete and not ready for use . 
 = = = The old Great Walls as Song boundary lines = = = 
 Han Chinese power during the tumultuous post @-@ Tang era was represented by the Song dynasty ( 960 – 1279 ) , which completed its unification of the Chinese states with the conquest of Wuyue in 971 . Turning to the north after this victory , in 979 the Song eliminated the Northern Han , ultimate successors to the Later Jin , but were unable to take the Sixteen Prefectures from the Liao dynasty . As a result of Song 's military aggression , relations between the Song and Liao remained tense and hostile . One of the battlegrounds in the Song – Liao War was the Great Wall Gap ( <unk> ) , so named because the southern Yan wall of the Warring States period crossed the Juma River here into Liao territory . The Great Wall Gap saw action in 979 , 988 – 989 , and 1004 , and a Song fortress was built there in 980 . Intermittent wars between the Song and the Liao lasted until January 1005 , when a truce was called and led to the Treaty of Chanyuan . This agreement , among other things , required the Song to pay tribute to the Liao , recognized the Song and Liao as equals , and demarcated the Song – Liao border , the course of which became more clearly defined in a series of subsequent bilateral agreements . Several stretches of the old Great Walls , including the Northern Qi Inner Wall near the <unk> mountain range , became the border between the Song and the Liao . 
 In the northwest , the Song were in conflict with the Western Xia , since they occupied what the Song considered as Chinese land lost during the Tang dynasty . The Song utilized the walls built during the reign of Qin 's King <unk> of the Warring States period , making it the Song – Western Xia border , but the topography of the area was not as sharp and distinct as the Song – Liao defences to the east . The border general Cao Wei ( <unk> ; 973 – 1030 ) deemed the Old Wall itself insufficient to slow a Tangut cavalry attack , and had a deep trench dug alongside . This trench , between 15 and 20 metres ( 49 and 66 ft ) in width and depth , proved an effective defence , but in 1002 the Tanguts caught the Song <unk> off guard and filled the trench to cross the Old Wall . Later , in 1042 , the Tanguts turned the trench against the Song by removing the bridges over it , thereby trapping the retreating army of Ge <unk> ( <unk> ) before annihilating it at the Battle of <unk> Fortress ( <unk> ) . 
 Despite the war with the Western Xia , the Song also settled land disputes with them by referring to prior agreements , as with the Liao . However , soon after the Jin dynasty overthrew the Liao dynasty , the Jurchens sacked the Song capital in 1127 during the Jin – Song wars , causing the Song court to flee south of the Yangtze River . For the next two and a half centuries , the Great Wall played no role in Han Chinese geopolitics . 
 = = = The onset of the Mongols = = = 
 In the 13th century , the Mongol leader Genghis Khan , once a vassal of the Jurchens , rose up against the Jin dynasty . In the ensuing Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty , the nomadic invaders avoided direct attacks on the Jin fortifications . Instead , when they could , the Mongols simply rode around the walls ; an effective example of this tactic is in 1211 , when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of <unk> . The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment against the Jin ; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls , such as those in Gubeikou , often preferred to surrender to the Mongols rather than fight them . The only major engagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended Juyong Pass : instead of laying siege , the Mongol general Jebe lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged in through the opened gates . In 1215 , Genghis Khan besieged , captured , and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing ( modern @-@ day Beijing ) . The Jin dynasty eventually collapsed following the siege of Caizhou in 1234 . Western Xia had already fallen in 1227 , and the Southern Song resisted the Mongols until 1279 . 
 With that , the Yuan dynasty , established by Genghis Khan 's grandson Khublai Khan , became the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China . Despite being the head of the Mongol Empire , Khublai Khan 's rule over China was not free from the threat of the steppe nomads . The Yuan dynasty faced challenges from rival claimants to the title of Great Khan and from rebellious Mongols in the north . Khublai Khan dealt with such threats by using both military blockades and economic sanctions . Although he established garrisons along the steppe frontier from the Juyan Lake Basin in the far west to <unk> in the east , Khublai Khan and the Yuan emperors after him did not add to the Great Wall ( except for the ornate Cloud Platform at Juyong Pass ) . When the Venetian traveller Marco Polo wrote of his experiences in China during the reign of Khublai Khan , he did not mention a Great Wall .

 = = = The early walls = = = 
 In 1368 , the Hongwu Emperor ( Zhu Yuanzhang , r . 1368 – 98 ) ousted the Mongol @-@ led Yuan dynasty from China to inaugurate the Ming dynasty . The Mongols fled back to Mongolia , but even after numerous campaigns , the Mongol problem remained . 
 During his early reign , Hongwu set up the " eight outer garrisons " close to the steppe and an inner line of forts more suitable for defence . The inner line was the forerunner to the Ming Great Wall . In 1373 , as Ming forces encountered setbacks , Hongwu put more emphasis on defence and adopted Hua <unk> 's ( <unk> ) suggestion to establish garrisons at 130 passes and other strategic points in the Beijing area . More positions were set up in the years up Hongwu 's death in 1398 , and watchtowers were manned from the Bohai Sea to Beijing and further onto the Mongolian steppes . These positions , however , were not for a linear defence but rather a regional one in which walls did not feature heavily , and offensive tactics remained the overarching policy at the time . In 1421 , the Ming capital was relocated from Nanjing in the south to Beijing in the north , partly to better manage the Mongol situation . Thus defenses were concentrated around Beijing , where stone and earth began to replace rammed earth in strategic passes . A wall was erected by the Ming in Liaodong to protect Han settlers from a possible threat from the <unk> @-@ Mongol <unk> around 1442 . In 1467 – 68 , expansion of the wall provided further protection for the region from against attacks by the Jianzhou Jurchens in the northeast . 
 Meanwhile , the outer defenses were gradually moved inward , thereby sacrificing a vital foothold in the steppe transitional zone . Despite the withdrawal from the steppe , the Ming military remained in a strong position against the nomads until the Tumu Crisis in 1449 , which caused the collapse of the early Ming security system . Over half of the campaigning Chinese army perished in the conflict , while the Mongols captured the Zhengtong Emperor . This military debacle shattered the Chinese military might that had so impressed and given pause to the Mongols since the beginning of the dynasty , and caused the Ming to be on the defensive ever since . 
 The deterioration of the Ming military position in the steppe transitional zone gave rise to nomadic raids into Ming territory , including the crucial Ordos region , on a level unprecedented since the dynasty 's founding . After decades of deliberation between an offensive strategy and an accommodative policy , the decision to build the first major Ming walls in the Ordos was agreed upon as an acceptable compromise the 1470s . 
 Yu Zijun ( <unk> ; 1429 – 1489 ) first proposed constructing a wall in the Ordos region in August 1471 , but not until 20 December 1472 did the court and emperor approve the plan . The 1473 victory in the Battle of Red Salt Lake ( <unk> ) by Wang Yue ( <unk> ) deterred Mongol invasions long enough for Yu Zijun to complete his wall project in 1474 . This wall , a combined effort between Yu Zijun and Wang Yue , stretched from present day <unk> ( <unk> ) in <unk> ( northwestern Ningxia province ) to <unk> town ( <unk> ) in <unk> County , and from there to <unk> ( <unk> ) in northeastern Shaanxi , a total of more than 2000 li ( about 1 @,@ 100 kilometres ( 680 mi ) ) long . Along its length were 800 strong points , sentry posts , beacon @-@ fire towers , and assorted defences . 40 @,@ 000 men were enlisted for this effort , which was completed in several months at a cost of over one million silver taels . This defence system proved its initial worth in 1482 , when a large group of Mongol raiders were trapped within the double lines of fortifications and suffered a defeat by the Ming generals . This was seen as a vindication of Yu Zijun 's strategy of wall @-@ building by the people of the border areas . By the mid @-@ 16th century , Yu 's wall in the Ordos had seen expansion into an extensive defence system . It contained two defence lines : Yu 's wall , called the " great border " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , and a " secondary border " ( <unk> , <unk> ) built by Yang <unk> ( <unk> ; 1454 – 1530 ) behind it . 
 Following the success of the Ordos walls , Yu Zijun proposed construction of a further wall that would extend from the Yellow River bend in the Ordos to the <unk> Pass ( <unk> ; in present @-@ day Yanqing County ) near the capital Beijing , running a distance of more than 1300 li ( about 700 kilometres ( 430 mi ) ) . The project received approval in 1485 , but Yu 's political enemies harped on the cost overruns and forced Yu to scrap the project and retire the same year . For more than 50 years after Yu 's resignation , political struggle prevented major wall constructions on a scale comparable to Yu 's Ordos project . 
 However , wall construction continued regardless of court politics during this time . The Ordos walls underwent extension , elaboration , and repair well into the 16th century . Brick and stone started to replace tamped earth as the wall building material , because they offered better protection and durability . This change in material gave rise to a number of necessary accommodations with regard to logistics , and inevitably a drastic increase in costs . Instead of being able to draw on local resources , building projects now required brick @-@ kilns , quarries , and transportation routes to deliver bricks to the work site . Also , masons had to be hired since the local peasantry proved inadequate for the level of sophistication that brick constructions required . Work that originally could be done by one man in a month with earth now required 100 men to do in stone . 
 = = = The Walls of Xuanfu – Datong and the western reaches = = = 
 With the Ordos now adequately fortified , the Mongols avoided its walls by riding east to invade Datong and Xuanfu ( <unk> ; present @-@ day <unk> , Hebei Province ) , which were two major garrisons guarding the corridor to Beijing where no walls had been built . The two defence lines of Xuanfu and Datong left by the Northern Qi and the early Ming had deteriorated by this point , and for all intents and purposes the inner line was the capital 's main line of defence . 
 From 1544 to 1549 , Weng Wanda ( <unk> ; 1498 – 1552 ) embarked on a defensive building program on a scale unprecedented in Chinese history . Troops were re @-@ deployed along the outer line , new walls and beacon towers were constructed , and fortifications were restored and extended along both lines . Firearms and artillery were mounted on the walls and towers during this time , for both defence and signalling purposes . The project 's completion was announced in the sixth month of 1548 . At its height , the Xuan – Da portion of the Great Wall totalled about 850 kilometres ( 530 mi ) of wall , with some sections being doubled @-@ up with two lines of wall , some tripled or even quadrupled . The outer frontier was now protected by a wall called the " outer border " ( <unk> , <unk> ) that extended 380 kilometres ( 240 mi ) from the Yellow River 's edge at the Piantou Pass ( <unk> ) along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province ; the " inner border " wall ( <unk> , <unk> ) ran southeast from Piantou Pass for some 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) , ending at the <unk> Pass ; a " river wall " ( <unk> , <unk> ) also ran from the Piantou Pass and followed the Yellow River southwards for about 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) . 
 As with Yu Zijun 's wall in the Ordos , the Mongols shifted their attacks away from the newly strengthened Xuan – Da sector to less well @-@ protected areas . In the west , Shaanxi province became the target of nomads riding west from the Yellow River loop . The westernmost fortress of Ming China , the Jiayu Pass , saw substantial enhancement with walls starting in 1539 , and from there border walls were built discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor to Wuwei , where the low earthen wall split into two . The northern section passed through <unk> and <unk> , where it met the western edge of the Yellow River loop before connecting with the Ordos walls , while the southern section passed through Lanzhou and continued northeast to <unk> .

 In 1550 , having once more been refused a request for trade , the Tümed Mongols under Altan Khan invaded the Xuan – Da region . However , despite several attempts , he could not take Xuanfu due to Weng Wanda 's double fortified line while the garrison at Datong bribed him to not attack there . Instead of continuing to operate in the area , he circled around Weng Wanda 's wall to the relatively lightly defended Gubeikou , northeast of Beijing . From there Altan Khan passed through the defences and raided the suburbs of Beijing . According to one contemporary source , the raid took more than 60 @,@ 000 lives and an additional 40 @,@ 000 people became prisoners . As a response to this raid , the focus of the Ming 's northern defences shifted from the Xuan – Da region to the Jizhou ( <unk> ) and Changping Defence Commands ( <unk> ) where the breach took place . Later in the same year , the dry @-@ stone walls of the Jizhou – Changping area ( abbreviated as " Ji @-@ Chang " ) were replaced by stone and mortar . These allowed the Chinese to build on steeper , more easily defended slopes and facilitated construction of features such as ramparts , crenelations , and peepholes . The effectiveness of the new walls was demonstrated in the failed Mongol raid of 1554 , where raiders expecting a repeat of the events of 1550 were surprised by the higher wall and stiff Chinese resistance . 
 In 1567 Qi <unk> and Tan Lun , successful generals who fended off the coastal pirates , were reassigned to manage the Ji – Chang Defense Commands and step up the defences of the capital region . Under their ambitious and energetic management , 1200 brick watchtowers were built along the Great Wall from 1569 to 1571 . These included the first large @-@ scale use of hollow watchtowers on the Wall : up until this point , most previous towers along the Great Wall had been solid , with a small hut on top for a sentry to take shelter from the elements and Mongol arrows ; the Ji – Chang towers built from 1569 onwards were hollow brick structures , allowing soldiers interior space to live , store food and water , stockpile weapons , and take shelter from Mongol arrows . 
 Altan Khan eventually made peace with China when it opened border cities for trade in 1571 , alleviating the Mongol need to raid . This , coupled with Qi and Tan 's efforts to secure the frontier , brought a period of relative peace along the border . However , minor raids still happened from time to time when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade , prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing . Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off , leading to the well @-@ known vistas of a stone @-@ faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today . 
 Wall construction continued until the demise of the Ming dynasty in 1644 . In the decades that led to the fall of the Ming dynasty , the Ming court and the Great Wall itself had to deal with simultaneous internal rebellions and the Manchu invasions . In addition to their conquest of Liaodong , the Manchus had raided across the Great Wall for the first time in 1629 , and again in 1634 , 1638 , and 1642 . Meanwhile , the rebels led by warlord Li Zicheng had been gathering strength . In the early months of 1644 , Li Zicheng declared himself the founder of the Shun and marched towards the Ming capital from Shaanxi . His route roughly followed the line of the Great Wall , in order to neutralize its heavily fortified garrisons . The crucial defences of Datong , Xuanfu , and Juyong Pass all surrendered without a fight , and the Chongzhen Emperor hanged himself on 25 April as the Shun army entered Beijing . At this point , the largest remaining Ming fighting force in North China was in Shanhai Pass , where the Great Wall meets the Bohai Sea . Its defender Wu Sangui , wedged between the Shun army within and the Manchus without , decided to surrender to the Manchus and opened the gates for them . The Manchus , having thus entered through the Great Wall , defeated Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass and seized Beijing on June 5 . They eventually defeated both the rebel @-@ founded Shun dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance , establishing their rule over all of China as the Qing dynasty . 
 Opinions about the Wall 's role in the Ming dynasty 's downfall are mixed . Historians such as Arthur Waldron and Julia Lovell are critical of the whole wall @-@ building exercise in light of its ultimate failure in protecting China ; the former compared the Great Wall with the failed Maginot Line of the French in World War II . However , independent scholar David Spindler notes that the Wall , being only part of a complex foreign policy , received " disproportionate blame " because it was the most obvious relic of that policy . 
 = = Qing dynasty ( 1644 – 1911 ) = = 
 The usefulness of the Great Wall as a defence line against northern nomads became questionable under the Qing dynasty , since their territory encompassed vast areas inside and outside the wall : China proper , Manchuria , and Mongolia were all under Qing control . So instead , the Great Wall became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes . In the case of Manchuria , considered to be the sacred homeland by the ruling Manchu elites , some parts of the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it could serve to control Han Chinese movement into Manchuria alongside the newly erected Willow Palisade . 
 Culturally , the wall 's symbolic role as a line between civilized society and barbarism was suppressed by the Qing , who were keen to weaken the Han culturalism that had been propagated by the Ming . As a result , no special attention was paid to the Great Wall until the mid @-@ Qing dynasty , when Westerners started to show interest in the structure . 
 = = = Western appreciation of the Wall = = = 
 The existence of a colossal wall in Asia had circulated in the Middle East and the West even before the first Europeans arrived in China by sea . The late antiquity historian Ammianus Marcellinus ( 330 ? – 395 ? ) mentioned " summits of lofty walls " enclosing the land of Seres , the country that the Romans believed to be at the eastern end of the Silk Road . In legend , the tribes of Gog and Magog were said to have been locked out by Alexander the Great with walls of steel . Later Arab writers and travellers , such as Rashid @-@ al @-@ Din Hamadani ( 1248 – 1318 ) and Ibn Battuta ( 1304 – 377 ) , would erroneously identify the Great Wall in China with the walls of the Alexander romances . This indicated that Arabs may have heard about China 's Great Wall during earlier periods of China 's history , and associated it with the wall in the Gog and Magog legend , a tale that found its way into the Quran . 
 Soon after Europeans reached Ming China in the early 16th century , accounts of the Great Wall started to circulate in Europe , even though no European would see it with their own eyes for another century . The work A Treatise of China and the <unk> Regions by Gaspar da Cruz ( c . 1520 – 70 ) offered an early discussion of the Great Wall in which he noted , " a Wall of an hundred leagues in length . And some will <unk> to bee more than a hundred leagues . " Another early account written by Bishop Juan González de Mendoza ( 1550 – 1620 ) reported a wall five hundred leagues long , but suggested that only one hundred leagues were man @-@ made , with the rest natural rock formations . The Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci ( 1552 – 1610 ) mentioned the Great Wall once in his diary , noting the existence of " a tremendous wall four hundred and five miles long " that formed part of the northern defences of the Ming Empire . 
 Europeans first witnessed the Great Wall in the early 1600s . Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via the Great Wall came in 1605 , when the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de Góis reached the northwestern Jiayu Pass from India . Ivan <unk> 's 1619 deposition for his Russian embassy mission offers an early account based on a first @-@ hand encounter with the Great Wall , and mentions that in the course of the journey his embassy travelled alongside the Great Wall for ten days . 
 Early European accounts were mostly modest and empirical , closely mirroring contemporary Chinese understanding of the Wall . However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas <unk> published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China <unk> of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 – 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 – 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a " monument to fear " . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to " all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland " and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice . The illustrations of the Great Wall by Lieutenant Henry William Parish during this mission would be reproduced in influential works such as Thomas Allom 's 1845 China , in a series of views . 
 Exposure to such works brought many foreign visitors to the Great Wall after China opened its borders as a result of the nation 's defeat in the Opium Wars of the mid @-@ 19th century at the hands of Britain and the other Western powers . The Juyong Pass near Beijing and the " Old Dragon Head , " where the Great Wall meets the sea at the Shanhai Pass , proved popular destinations for these wall watchers . 
 The travelogues of the later 19th century in turn further contributed to the elaboration and propagation of the Great Wall myth . Examples of this myth 's growth are the false but widespread belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon or Mars . 
 = = Modern China ( 1911 – present ) = = 
 The Xinhai Revolution in 1911 forced the abdication of the last Qing Emperor Puyi and ended China 's last imperial dynasty . The revolutionaries , headed by Sun Yat @-@ sen , were concerned with creating a modern sense of national identity in the chaotic post @-@ imperial era . In contrast to Chinese academics such as Liang <unk> , who tried to counter the West 's fantastic version of the Great Wall , Sun Yat @-@ sen held the view that Qin Shi Huang 's wall preserved the Chinese race , and without it Chinese culture would not have developed enough to expand to the south and assimilate foreign conquerors . Such an endorsement from the " Father of Modern China " started to transform the Great Wall into a national symbol in the Chinese consciousness , though this transformation was hampered by conflicting views of nationalism with regard to the nascent " new China . " 
 The failure of the new Republic of China fanned disillusionment with traditional Chinese culture and ushered in the New Culture Movement and the May Fourth Movement of the mid @-@ 1910s and 1920s that aimed to dislodge China 's future trajectory from its past . Naturally , the Great Wall of China came under attack as a symbol of the past . For example , an influential writer of this period , Lu Xun , harshly criticized the " mighty and accursed Great Wall " in a short essay : " In reality , it has never served any purpose than to make countless workers labour to death in vain ... [ It ] surrounds everyone . " 
 Sino @-@ Japanese conflict ( 1931 – 45 ) gave the Great Wall a new lease of life in the eyes of the Chinese . During the 1933 defence of the Great Wall , inadequately @-@ equipped Chinese soldiers held off double their number of Japanese troops for several months . Using the cover of the Great Wall , the Chinese – who were at times only armed with broadswords – were able to beat off a Japanese advance that had the support of aerial bombardment . With the Chinese forces eventually overrun , the subsequent <unk> Truce stipulated that the Great Wall was to become a demilitarized zone separating China and the newly created Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo . Even so , the determined defence of the Great Wall made it a symbol of Chinese patriotism and the resoluteness of the Chinese people . The Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong picked up this symbol in his poetry during his " Long March " escaping from Kuomintang prosecution . Near the end of the trek in 1935 , Mao wrote the poem " Mount <unk> " that contains the well @-@ known line that would be carved in stone along the Great Wall in the present day : " Those who fail to reach the Great Wall are not true men " ( <unk> ) . Another noteworthy reference to the Great Wall is in the song " The March of the Volunteers " , whose words came from a stanza in Tian Han 's 1934 poem entitled " The Great Wall " . The song , originally from the anti @-@ Japanese movie Children of Troubled Times , enjoyed continued popularity in China and was selected as the provisional national anthem of the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) at its establishment in 1949 . 
 In 1952 , the scholar @-@ turned @-@ bureaucrat Guo Moruo laid out the first modern proposal to repair the Great Wall . Five years later , the renovated Badaling became the first section to be opened to the public since the establishment of the PRC . The Badaling Great Wall has since become a staple stop for foreign dignitaries who come to China , beginning with Nepali prime minister <unk> Prasad Koirala in 1960 , and most notably the American president Richard Nixon in his historic 1972 visit to China . To date , Badaling is still the most visited stretch of the Great Wall . 
 Other stretches did not fare so well . During the Cultural Revolution ( 1966 – 76 ) , hundreds of kilometres of the Great Wall — already damaged in the wars of the last century and eroded by wind and rain — were deliberately destroyed by fervent Red Guards who regarded it as part of the " Four Olds " to be eradicated in the new China . Quarrying machines and even dynamite were used to dismantle the Wall , and the pilfered materials were used for construction . 
 As China opened up in the 1980s , reformist leader Deng Xiaoping initiated the " Love our China and restore our Great Wall " campaign ( <unk> ， <unk> ) to repair and preserve the Great Wall . The Great Wall was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 . However , while tourism boomed over the years , slipshod restoration methods have left sections of the Great Wall near Beijing " looking like a Hollywood set " in the words of the National Geographic News . The less prominent stretches of the Great Wall did not get as much attention . In 2002 the New York @-@ based World Monuments Fund put the Great Wall on its list of the World 's 100 Most Endangered Sites . In 2003 the Chinese government began to enact laws to protect the Great Wall . 
 = = Historiography = = 
 In China , one of the first individuals to attempt a multi @-@ dynastic history of the Great Wall was the 17th @-@ century scholar Gu <unk> . More recently , in the 1930s and 1940s , Wang <unk> ( <unk> ) and Shou Pengfei ( <unk> ) produced exhaustive studies that culled extant literary records to date and mapped the courses of early border walls . However , these efforts were based solely on written records that contain obscure place names and elusive literary references . 
 The rise of modern archeology has contributed much to the study of the Great Wall , either in corroborating existing research or in refuting it . However these efforts do not yet give a full picture of the Great Wall 's history , as many wall sites dating to the Period of <unk> ( 220 – 589 ) had been overlaid by the extant Ming Great Wall . 
 Western scholarship of the Great Wall was , until recently , affected by misconceptions derived from traditional accounts of the Wall . When the Jesuits brought back the first reports of the Wall to the West , European scholars were puzzled that Marco Polo had not mentioned the presumably perennial " Great Wall " in his Travels . Some 17th @-@ century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall . Thus , Father Martino Martini 's mistaken claim that the Wall had " lasted right up to the present time without injury or destruction " since the time of Qin was accepted as fact by the 18th @-@ century philosophes . 
 Since then , many scholars have operated under the belief that the Great Wall continually defended China 's border against the steppe nomads for two thousand years . For example , the 18th @-@ century sinologist Joseph de <unk> assigned <unk> importance to such walls when he advanced the theory that the Qin construction forced the Xiongnu to migrate west to Europe and , becoming known as the Huns , ultimately contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire . Some have attempted to make general statements regarding Chinese society and foreign policy based on the conception of a perennial Great Wall : Karl Marx took the Wall to represent the stagnation of the Chinese society and economy , Owen Lattimore supposed that the Great Wall demonstrated a need to divide the nomadic way of life from the agricultural communities of China , and John K. Fairbank posited that the Wall played a part in upholding the <unk> world order . 
 Despite the significance that the Great Wall seemed to have , scholarly treatment of the Wall itself remained scant during the 20th century . Joseph Needham bemoaned this dearth when he was compiling the section on walls for his Science and Civilisation in China : " There is no lack of travelers ' description of the Great Wall , but studies based on modern scholarship are few and far between , whether in Chinese or Western languages . " In 1990 , Arthur Waldron published the influential The Great Wall : From History to Myth , where he challenged the notion of a unitary Great Wall maintained since antiquity , dismissing it as a modern myth . Waldron 's approach prompted a re @-@ examination of the Wall in Western scholarship . Still , as of 2008 , there is not yet a full authoritative text in any language that is devoted to the Great Wall . The reason for this , according to The New Yorker journalist Peter Hessler , is that the Great Wall fits into neither the study of political institutions ( favoured by Chinese historians ) nor the excavation of tombs ( favoured by Chinese archeologists ) . Some of the void left by academia is being filled by independent research from Great Wall enthusiasts such as ex @-@ Xinhua reporter Cheng Dalin ( <unk> ) and self @-@ funded scholar David Spindler . 
 = Geography of South Dakota = 
 South Dakota is a state located in the north @-@ central United States . It is usually considered to be in the Midwestern region of the country . The state can generally be divided into three geographic regions : eastern South Dakota , western South Dakota , and the Black Hills . Eastern South Dakota is lower in elevation and higher in precipitation than the western part of the state , and the Black Hills are a low , isolated mountain group in the southwestern corner of the state . Smaller sub @-@ regions in the state include the Coteau des Prairies , Coteau du Missouri , James River Valley , the Dissected Till Plains , and the Badlands . Geologic formations in South Dakota range in age from two billion @-@ year @-@ old Precambrian granite in the Black Hills to glacial till deposited over the last few million years . South Dakota is the 17th @-@ largest state in the country . 
 South Dakota has a humid continental climate in the east and in the Black Hills , and a semi @-@ arid climate in the west outside of the Black Hills , featuring four very distinct seasons , and the ecology of the state features plant and animal species typical of a North American temperate grassland biome . A number of areas under the protection of the federal or state government , such as Badlands National Park , Wind Cave National Park , and Custer State Park , are located in the state . 
 In 2011 , the population of South Dakota was estimated to be 824 @,@ 082 , and the state ranks fifth @-@ lowest in both total population as well as population density in the United States . Sioux Falls , with a population of just over 150 @,@ 000 , is the largest city in the state . Rapid City ranks as South Dakota 's second @-@ largest city , and Pierre is the state capital . Historically a very agricultural state , the service and tourism sectors have grown in economic importance in recent years . 
 = = Location and size = = 
 South Dakota is situated in the north @-@ central United States , and is considered to be a part of the Midwest by the U.S. Census Bureau , although the Great Plains region also covers the state . Additionally , the culture , economy , and geography of western South Dakota has more in common with the West than the Midwest . The state has a total land area of 77 @,@ 116 sq. miles ( 199 @,@ 905 km2 ) , making it the 17th largest in the Union . South Dakota is bordered to the north by North Dakota ; to the south by Nebraska ; to the east by Iowa and Minnesota ; and to the west by Wyoming and Montana . The western border is the Black Hills meridian , a north @-@ south line set out at a certain distance from Washington , D.C. , to separate South Dakota from Montana and Wyoming during the transition to statehood . 
 Two time zones cover South Dakota ; the state is split roughly in half between the Central Time Zone ( UTC @-@ 6 ) in the east and the Mountain Time Zone ( UTC @-@ 7 ) in the west . The boundary between the two zones runs south down the Missouri River until Pierre , at which point the boundary roughly continues due south while the river turns southeast . 
 The North American continental pole of inaccessibility is in Bennett County , located 1024 mi ( 1650 km ) from the nearest coastline , between Allen and Kyle ( Oglala Lakota County ) at 43 @.@ 36 ° N 101 @.@ 97 ° W ﻿ / 43 @.@ 36 ; <unk> ﻿ ( Pole of <unk> North America ) . 
 = = Regions = = 
 South Dakota can generally be divided into three regions : eastern South Dakota , western South Dakota , and the Black Hills . The Missouri River serves as a somewhat stark boundary in terms of geographic , social and political differences between eastern and western South Dakota , and the geography of the Black Hills differs from its surroundings to such an extent that it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota . South Dakotans also at times combine the Black Hills with the rest of western South Dakota , and refer to the two resulting regions , divided by the Missouri , as West River and East River . 
 Eastern South Dakota is generally wetter and features lower topography than the western part of the state . Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies , the Dissected Till Plains , and the James River Valley . The Coteau des Prairies is a higher region bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin . Numerous glacial lakes cover the Coteau , and it is largely drained by the Big Sioux River , a tributary of the Missouri . Further to the west , the James River Basin is mostly low , flat , highly eroded land , following the flow of the James River through South Dakota from north to south . The Dissected Till Plains , an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska , also extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota . 
 The Coteau du Missouri lies between the James River Basin of the Drift Prairie and the Missouri River . This region is the southern section of a large plateau extending into Canada . 
 The Great Plains cover most of the western two @-@ thirds of South Dakota . West of the Missouri River the landscape becomes more rugged and consists of rolling hills , plains , ravines , and steep flat @-@ topped hills called buttes . These buttes sometimes rise 400 to 600 feet ( 120 to 180 m ) above the plains . In the south , east of the Black Hills , lie the South Dakota Badlands . 
 The Black Hills are in the southwestern part of South Dakota and extend into Wyoming . This range of low mountains covers 6 @,@ 000 sq. miles ( 15 @,@ 500 km2 . ) with mountains that rise from 2 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 600 to 1 @,@ 200 m ) above their bases . The highest point in South Dakota , Harney Peak ( 7 @,@ 242 ft or 2 @,@ 207 m above sea level ) , is in the Black Hills . This is the highest point in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains . Other Black Hills mountains that are over 7 @,@ 000 ft ( 2 @,@ 133 m ) in elevation include Bear Mountain , Crooks Tower , Terry Peak , and Crows Nest Peak . The Black Hills are rich in minerals such as gold , silver , copper , and lead . The Homestake Mine , the largest and deepest gold mine in North America , was located in the Black Hills and produced over $ 1 billion in gold since it started operation in 1876 . The mine is now a scientific laboratory . 
 = = Geology = = 
 South Dakota geologic formations and deposits range in age from several billion to several thousand years , and the age of the rocks generally decreases as one moves from west to east across the state . The oldest geologic formations in the state were created over two billion years ago during the Precambrian , and consist of metamorphic and igneous rocks . These form the central core of the Black Hills , but they can also be found in two isolated locations in eastern South Dakota near Milbank and Sioux Falls . Formations from the Paleozoic Era form the outer ring of the Black Hills ; these were created between roughly 540 and 250 million years ago . This area features rocks such as limestone which were deposited here when the area formed the shoreline of an ancient inland sea . 
 Outside of the Black Hills , much of western South Dakota features rock formed during the Mesozoic Era , from 250 million to 66 million years ago . At the time , much of western and central South Dakota was again covered by a shallow inland sea . Marine skeletons from this ocean settled to the seafloor and were compacted to form the sedimentary rocks in the area today . During this period , the Black Hills , which had been pushed up to an elevation of around 15 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 500 m ) , lost around 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) worth of rock layers due to erosion . Many of these sediments ended up in the same area as the marine deposits from the inland sea , and both contribute to western South Dakota 's present @-@ day geological makeup . In several areas in western South Dakota , tertiary deposits may also be found . These were formed between 66 and 2 @.@ 5 million years ago from eroded mountains to the west . There is also volcanic material deposited here that presumably came from the Yellowstone area . These layers of sedimentary rock are distinctly visible in the multi @-@ colored rocks and cliffs of Badlands National Park . 
 Layers deposited during the Pleistocene epoch , starting around two million years ago , cover most of eastern South Dakota . These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state , and are the product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil , known as till , over the area . The thickness of the glacial till layer ranges between 100 and 900 feet ( 30 and 270 m ) . This till is also what makes agriculture more prevalent in eastern South Dakota as it is extremely fertile . 
 Much of the human history of South Dakota was shaped by its geology . Gold seekers founded most of the larger cities around the Black Hills , and quarrying was an important economic activity in several areas in eastern South Dakota . Mines and quarries in present @-@ day South Dakota produce gold , Sioux quartzite , Milbank granite , sand , gravel , limestone , mica , and uranium . The state also produces a very limited amount of oil and natural gas . 
 = = Rivers and lakes = = 
 The Missouri River is the largest and longest river in the state . Other major South Dakota rivers include the Cheyenne , the James , the Big Sioux , and the White . Essentially all of South Dakota 's rivers are part of the Missouri River Valley . Dams on the Missouri River create four large reservoirs : Lake Oahe , Lake Sharpe , Lake Francis Case , and Lewis and Clark Lake . Hydroelectricity generated from power plants at the dams provides approximately half of the electricity used by South Dakotans . 
 The vast majority of South Dakota 's natural lakes are located in the eastern half of the state , and most are the product of the most recent ice age . The title of largest natural lake is somewhat disputed ; Lake Thompson is larger than Lake Poinsett , but Lake Poinsett has maintained its current size for a much longer period of time . Other major natural lakes include Lake <unk> , <unk> Lake , Lake Madison , Lake Whitewood , and Lake Herman . Additionally , two large lakes , Big Stone Lake and Lake Traverse , form part of the border between South Dakota and Minnesota . The continental divide separating the drainage basin of Hudson Bay from that of the Gulf of Mexico is situated between these two lakes . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Much of South Dakota , with the notable exception of the Black Hills , is dominated by a temperate grasslands biome . Although grasses and crops cover most of this region , deciduous trees such as cottonwoods , elms , and willows are common near rivers and in shelter belts . In open , uncultivated areas of the plains , grasses such as <unk> , western wheatgrass , switchgrass , big bluestem and little bluestem thrive . Mammals in this area include bison , deer , pronghorn , coyotes , beavers , and prairie dogs , while reptiles include the snapping turtle , the box turtle , and various types of snakes . The prairie rattlesnake is South Dakota 's only venomous snake . Rivers and lakes of the grasslands support populations of walleye , carp , pike , and bass , along with other species . The Missouri River also contains the pre @-@ historic paddlefish , and chinook salmon , native to the Pacific Northwest , have been successfully introduced in Lake Oahe .

 With the state 's highest precipitation , southeastern South Dakota once had 3 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) to 6 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) -tall grasses , herbs , and low shrubs . The region has plenty of groundwater and , because of common spring floods , does not have many burrowing animals . Before modern agriculture , the tall grass prairies had large numbers of big bluestem , little bluestem , Indian grass , switchgrass , sand <unk> , and other tall grasses . Flood plains along the Missouri and Big Sioux Rivers are habitat for wild rye , <unk> , and <unk> . The tall grass prairies have wild rose and buck bush shrubs , and goldenrod , sunflower , cinquefoil , and milkweed herbs . Marsh hawks , <unk> , short @-@ eared owl , and short @-@ billed marsh wren birds make their home in this prairie , and jackrabbits , cottontail rabbits , meadow mice , and deer are common animal life .

 Plants in the mid and tall grass prairies grow 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) tall . Precipitation here averages 18 inches ( 460 mm ) to 22 inches ( 560 mm ) per year . This region is a transition zone between the tall grasses to the southeast and the mid and short grasses to the west . In this zone , the eastern portion and river valleys have characteristics of the tall grass region , and the western part as well as well @-@ drained land have similarities to the mid and short grass prairies . Common grasses here are needlegrass and needle @-@ and @-@ thread grass .

 Plants in the mid and tall grass prairies average about 6 inches ( 150 mm ) with a maximum height of about 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) . Short grasses live in well @-@ drained regions and mid grasses are in lowlands . Porcupine grass , needlegrass , western wheatgrass and prairie June grass are the predominant grasses , while the lead plant and prairie rose are the most common shrubs . Prairie clover and goldenrod are herbs in this region ; the pineapple flower and pasque flower are seasonal flowers . The pasque flower is the South Dakota state flower . While antelope and bison were common in prior centuries , modern animal life consists of deer , jackrabbit , skunk , badger , pocket gopher , and weasel . Pheasants , ducks , geese , sparrows , hawks , owls , and larks are the common birds , while bull snakes and blue racers have replaced the prairie rattler as the most common reptiles . 
 = = = Short and mid grass prairies = = = 
 Steppe grasslands predominate in the western two @-@ thirds of South Dakota . Precipitation is irregular and averages 13 inches ( 330 mm ) to 18 inches ( 460 mm ) per year . Hailstorms , blizzards , and thunderstorms rush across the prairie , which has little shelter for plants or animals . Nevertheless , many animals make their home here : among them , grey wolf , coyote , antelope , jackrabbit , kit fox , and bison . The rattlesnake and bull snake live in this prairie , as well as the blue racer . Many birds have their habitat here : geese , ducks , falcons , hawks , turkey buzzards , owls , sparrows , larks , blackbirds , and more . Evening primroses , prairie lilies , blazing star , aster , goldenrod , sunflower , and wild onions are common plants . So too are wild alfalfa , buffalo bean , and prairie clover legumes . Vegetation is predominantly blue grama , little bluestem , bunchgrass , <unk> , wheatgrass , and green <unk> . 
 = = = The coniferous Black Hills = = = 
 Due to higher elevation and precipitation , the ecology of the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains . The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous <unk> evergreens : various types of pines — including ponderosa ( covering 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 400 @,@ 000 ha ) , or 80 % of the Black Hills forest ) , lodgepole , white , and timber — as well as western red cedar and spruces . Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area . The South Dakota state tree is the Black Hills spruce . The Red Valley is home to blue @-@ joint and <unk> , and wild plum , <unk> , and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills . Violets , thistles , and horse mint are prevalent herbs . Vines grow widely : the <unk> , bittersweet , and wild grape , which is the pattern for Black Hills gold jewelry . 
 Black Hills mammals include deer , elk ( wapiti ) , bighorn sheep , mountain goats , and mountain lions , while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout . <unk> rabbits and wood rabbits live throughout the Hills , as do squirrels , raccoons , chipmunks , and porcupines . Wild burro and bobcat can be found , as well as bison in limited quantity . Woodpecker , robin , sparrow , jay , bobwhite , and wren are Black Hills birds . 
 = = = Birds = = = 
 South Dakota 's varied geography is inhabited by many species of birds . The state bird , the ring @-@ necked pheasant , has adapted particularly well to the area after being introduced from China , and growing populations of bald eagles are spread throughout the state , especially near the Missouri River . The wild turkey is another large bird found in many areas of the state . The numerous lakes and wetlands of eastern South Dakota support migratory populations of Canada geese , snow geese , mallards , pelicans , and wood ducks . The prairie serves as home to songbirds such as meadowlarks ( both the eastern and western varieties ) , goldfinches , and bluebirds , and the open landscape of the plains also suits many carnivorous birds , such as hawks , falcons , and owls . 
 = = Climate = = 
 South Dakota has a continental climate , semi @-@ arid in the west outside of the Black Hills , with four distinct seasons , ranging from very cold winters to hot summers . During the summers , the average high temperature throughout the state is often close to 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) , although it generally cools down to near 60 ° F ( 15 ° C ) at night . It is not unusual for South Dakota to have severe hot , dry spells in the summer with the temperature climbing above 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) several times every year . Winters are cold with January high temperatures averaging below freezing and low temperatures averaging below 10 ° F ( - 12 ° C ) in most of the state . The highest temperature recorded in the state was 120 ° F ( 49 ° C ) on July 5 , 1936 in Gann Valley , and the lowest was – 58 ° F ( - 50 ° C ) on February 17 , 1936 in McIntosh . 
 Average annual precipitation in South Dakota ranges from semi @-@ arid in the northwestern part of the state ( around 15 inches , or 381 mm ) to semi @-@ humid around the southeast portion of the state ( around 25 inches , or 635 mm ) , although a small area centered on Lead in the Black Hills has the highest precipitation at nearly 30 inches ( 762 mm ) per year . 
 South Dakota summers bring frequent thunderstorms which can be severe with high winds , thunder , and hail . The eastern part of the state is often considered part of tornado alley , and South Dakota experiences an average of 29 tornadoes per year . Winters are somewhat more stable , although severe weather in the form of blizzards and ice storms can occur during the season . Severe weather in the state can occasionally turn deadly . Between 1950 and 1994 , 11 people were killed by tornadoes in the state , and the 1972 Black Hills flood tore through central Rapid City , killing 238 people and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage . 
 = = Protected areas = = 
 South Dakota contains several sites that are protected by the National Park Service . Two national parks have been established in South Dakota , both of which are located in the southwestern part of the state . Badlands National Park was created in 1978 . The park features a highly eroded , brightly colored landscape surrounded by semi @-@ arid grasslands . Wind Cave National Park , established in 1903 in the Black Hills , contains an extensive cave network as well as a large herd of bison . Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills was established in 1925 . The well @-@ known attraction features a mountain carved by sculptor Gutzon Borglum to resemble four former U.S. presidents . Other areas managed by the National Park Service include Jewel Cave National Monument near Custer , the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail , the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site , which features a decommissioned nuclear missile silo , and the Missouri National Recreational River . In addition to the National Park Service , the United States Forest Service manages several areas in the state . South Dakota contains two national forests , Black Hills National Forest and a small section of Custer National Forest , and three national grasslands : Buffalo Gap , Dakota Prairie , and Fort Pierre . 
 South Dakota also contains numerous state parks , all of which are managed by the South Dakota Department of Game , Fish , and Parks . Custer State Park in the Black Hills is a large state park with over 71 @,@ 000 acres , and includes Sylvan Lake , Needles Highway , and a wildlife loop featuring a large bison herd and the " begging burros " , among other species . Other notable parks in the state include Bear Butte State Park near Sturgis and Lewis and Clark State Recreation Area near Yankton .

 According to the U.S. Census Bureau , in 2010 South Dakota had a population of 814 @,@ 180 . As of the 2010 census , the state ranked fifth @-@ lowest in the United States in both total population as well as population density . The center of population of South Dakota is located in Buffalo County , in the unincorporated county seat of <unk> . 
 The five largest ancestry groups in South Dakota are : German ( 40 @.@ 7 % ) , Norwegian ( 15 @.@ 3 % ) , Irish ( 10 @.@ 4 % ) , Native American ( 8 @.@ 3 % ) , and English ( 7 @.@ 1 % ) . German @-@ Americans are the largest ancestry group in most parts of the state , although there are also large Scandinavian populations in some counties . American Indians , largely Lakota , Dakota , and Nakota ( Sioux ) are predominant in several counties , mostly in the western part of the state . South Dakota has the third @-@ highest proportion of Native Americans of any state . 
 Rural areas in South Dakota are experiencing a trend of falling populations , despite an overall increase in population . The effect of rural flight has not been spread evenly through South Dakota , however . Although most rural counties and small towns have lost population , the Sioux Falls area and the Black Hills have gained population . In fact , Lincoln County , near Sioux Falls , is the ninth fastest @-@ growing county ( by percentage ) in the United States . The growth in these areas has compensated for losses in the rest of the state , and South Dakota 's total population continues to increase steadily , albeit at a slower rate than the national average . 
 = = = Cities and counties = = = 
 South Dakota is relatively notable for its lack of large urban centers . Sioux Falls , the largest city in the state , only ranks as the 152nd largest in the country , and the state 's third @-@ largest city , Aberdeen , has a population of less than 25 @,@ 000 . However , because the population in many rural areas has decreased over the last 50 years , and many cities in the state have grown at a rapid pace ; the population has become more concentrated and less rural than it once was . According to 2007 census estimates , the three most populous counties in the state , Minnehaha , Pennington , and Lincoln , were home to 38 @.@ 8 % of South Dakotans , while in 1910 , those counties held only 9 @.@ 3 % of the population . 
 Sioux Falls is the largest city in South Dakota , with an estimated 2007 population of 151 @,@ 505 , and a metropolitan area population of 227 @,@ 171 . The city is located in the southeast corner of the state , and was founded in 1856 . The economy of Sioux Falls , originally focused on agri @-@ business and quarrying , has recently become largely centered on retail and financial services . Rapid City , with a 2007 estimated population of 63 @,@ 997 , and a metropolitan area population of 120 @,@ 279 , is the second @-@ largest city in the state . It is located on the eastern edge of the Black Hills in western South Dakota , and was founded in 1876 . Rapid City 's economy is largely based on tourism and defense spending , due to the close proximity of tourist attractions in the Black Hills and Ellsworth Air Force Base . The next eight largest cities in the state , in order of descending 2007 population , are Aberdeen ( 24 @,@ 410 ) , Watertown ( 20 @,@ 530 ) , Brookings ( 19 @,@ 463 ) , Mitchell ( 14 @,@ 832 ) , Pierre ( 14 @,@ 032 ) , Yankton ( 13 @,@ 643 ) , Huron ( 10 @,@ 902 ) , and Vermillion ( 10 @,@ 251 ) . Pierre is the state capital , and Brookings and Vermillion are the locations of the state 's two largest universities . Of the ten largest cities in the state , Rapid City is the only one located west of the Missouri River . 
 = = = Economy = = = 
 South Dakota 's early economy relied heavily on the soil , minerals and ecology of the area , as nearly all of the earliest white settlers in the area were farmers , miners , or trappers . Although other economic sectors have risen in prominence in recent years , early dependence on the land laid the foundation for the future economic activity of the state . 
 Agriculture has historically been a key component of the South Dakota economy . Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades , agricultural production is still very important to the state 's economy , especially in rural areas . The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle , corn ( maize ) , soybeans , wheat , and hogs . Agriculture @-@ related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state . South Dakota is one of the largest producers of ethanol in the nation . 
 Another important sector in South Dakota 's economy is tourism . Many travel to visit the national parks , state parks , and national monuments in the state , particularly those of the Black Hills region . South Dakota 's location between national parks in the west and large cities to the east also contributes to the state 's tourism and hospitality industry . In 2006 , tourism provided an estimated 33 @,@ 000 jobs in the state and contributed over two billion US $ to the economy of South Dakota .

 South Dakota has a total of 83 @,@ 609 miles ( 134 @,@ 556 km ) of highways , roads , and streets , along with 679 miles ( 1 @,@ 093 km ) of interstate highways . Two major interstates pass through South Dakota : Interstate 90 , which runs east and west ; and Interstate 29 , running north and south in the eastern portion of the state . Also located in the state are the shorter interstates 190 and 229 . Several major U.S. highways pass through the state . U.S. routes 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , and 212 travel east and west , while U.S. routes 81 , 83 , 85 and 281 run north and south . Railroads have played an important role in South Dakota transportation since the mid @-@ nineteenth century . Some 4 @,@ 420 miles ( 7 @,@ 113 km ) of railroad track were built in South Dakota during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , but only 1 @,@ 839 miles ( 2 @,@ 959 km ) of railroad are currently operational .

 = Enlightenment ( Doctor Who ) = 
 Enlightenment is the fifth serial of the 20th season in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , which aired on BBC1 in four twice @-@ weekly parts from 1 March 1983 to 9 March 1983 . The 127th serial of the series , Enlightenment was the third of three loosely connected serials known as the Black Guardian Trilogy . It was written by Barbara Clegg and directed by Fiona Cumming . 
 In the serial , alien time traveller the Doctor ( Peter Davison ) and his companions Tegan Jovanka ( Janet Fielding ) and <unk> Turlough ( Mark Strickson ) encounter a group of god @-@ like immortals who are racing historical Earth sailing vessels through space , crewed by humans they had plucked out of time , in an attempt to win the prize of the titular enlightenment . Turlough is under the control of the Black Guardian ( Valentine Dyall ) , but struggles with the Guardian 's orders to kill the Doctor . 
 The serial 's production was beset by problems caused by industrial action taken by electricians at the BBC during filming . It was eventually finished three months behind schedule , but the unavailability of several actors for new filming dates forced the production team to recast their parts at short notice . Enlightenment averaged of 6 @.@ 8 million viewers per episode on its first transmission and received generally positive reviews from critics . The story was novelised by its writer , Barbara Clegg , as part of the ongoing Target Books range in 1984 and was released on video and DVD in 1993 and 2009 respectively . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Following interference from the White ( Cyril Luckham ) and Black ( Valentine Dyall ) Guardians , the TARDIS materialises in what appears to be the hold of a ship . The Fifth Doctor ( Peter Davison ) leaves companion Tegan ( Janet Fielding ) in the TARDIS while he and Turlough ( Mark Strickson ) leave to explore . 
 The Doctor discovers the crew remember nothing of coming aboard , have been below decks the whole time , and that the ship they are on has been entered in some sort of race . Tegan leaves the TARDIS and encounters the ship 's first mate , Marriner ( Christopher Brown ) , who offers to take her to her friends , while the Doctor and Turlough encounter Captain Striker ( Keith Barron ) . In the ship 's wheelhouse , the Doctor sees a map of the racecourse , complete with " marker buoys " which he recognises as the planets of Earth 's solar system . Marriner then operates anachronistic electronic controls and a viewscreen activates to show the other contestants — a Greek trireme , a 17th Century pirate ship , and other vessels from other times , all floating in deep space and using solar wind propulsion . 
 The Doctor discovers that the ship 's officers are Eternals , beings who live in the " trackless wastes of eternity , " as opposed to the Doctor and his companions , who are " <unk> . " When one of the other ships explodes the Doctor begins to suspect sabotage . Tegan feels ill , so Marriner escorts her to a room , which contains items from the TARDIS and her rooms in Brisbane and realises Marriner has been reading her mind . 
 The Doctor discovers that Eternals use <unk> for their thoughts and ideas . The Eternals have lived for so long that they are unable to think for themselves and need human minds to give them existence . The prize for winning the race is Enlightenment , the wisdom to know everything . The TARDIS is discovered by the Eternals , who make it vanish . Trapped on board the Edwardian ship for the moment , the Doctor and his companions go on board deck in space suits . Turlough hears the voice of the Black Guardian taunting him and unable to take the strain , he leaps overboard into space . 
 Turlough is rescued by the Buccaneer , the pirate ship commanded by Captain Wrack ( Lynda Baron ) . Wrack sends her first mate to present one of the other competitors with a jewelled sword , and to deliver party invitations to the other captains . Marriner offers to escort Tegan and the Doctor to the party as one of the ships draws level with the Buccaneer . Wrack shows Turlough a locked chamber with a vacuum shield , and he hears the voice of the Black Guardian through the door as the rival ship explodes , apparently hit by an asteroid . The Doctor again suspects foul play as the ship was also challenging the Buccaneer . 
 Arriving on board the Buccaneer , the Doctor and Tegan mingle while Turlough sneaks off to examine the locked chamber . Following Turlough , the Doctor discovers a device he believes that Wrack uses to transmit power to destroy the other ships , using some sort of focus . The pair recall that the captains of both destroyed ships had received red crystals as gifts from Wrack , leading the Doctor to believe that the crystals are the focus . Before they can act on it , however , they are captured by Wrack 's first mate . Meanwhile , Wrack has managed to lure Tegan away from the party to her wheelhouse and freezes her in time while she plants a crystal in her tiara . 
 Confronted by Wrack , Turlough accuses the Doctor of being a spy and claims he was trying to capture the Doctor . The Doctor , Tegan and Marriner return to their ship but Wrack reads Turlough 's mind , discovering he is lying , and is about to kill him , only for Turlough to tell her that he , too , serves the Black Guardian . As the ships near the crystalline space station of the Enlighteners , the Buccaneer pulls level with the Edwardian Ship , and Wrack takes Turlough into her chamber , this time letting him witness her summoning the power of the Black Guardian . The Doctor , seeing the Buccaneer pull close , discovers the crystal in Tegan 's tiara . The Doctor smashes it , but only manages to multiply its power by the number of fragments . 
 The Doctor hurls the pieces overboard as they explode . Suddenly , the wind dies , and Wrack pulls ahead of the Edwardian ship . The Eternals return the TARDIS to the Doctor and he travels to the Buccaneer . He tries to reason with Wrack , but her first mate shows up with Turlough , and she orders that the Doctor be thrown into space . As Tegan watches from the Edwardian ship , two bodies are ejected into space , and the Buccaneer reaches the finish . The human crews of the ships vanish . 
 The Enlighteners are the Black and White Guardians , and the winner is the Doctor , who brought the ship in with Turlough 's help when Wrack and her first mate met with an " accident . " The Doctor , however , refuses the diamond crystal containing Enlightenment , and the White Guardian dismisses Striker and Marriner , who vanish back into eternity . As Turlough helped the Doctor , he is entitled to a portion of the prize . The Black Guardian reminds Turlough of their bargain , and says that he can give up the diamond , or sacrifice the Doctor to gain both Enlightenment and the TARDIS . Turlough hurls the diamond at the Black Guardian , who vanishes in screams and flames . The Doctor points out that Enlightenment was not the diamond , but the choice itself .

 To commemorate the show 's anniversary , every story during Season 20 included the return of an enemy from The Doctor 's past . During this trilogy ( begun in the serial Mawdryn Undead , and concluding with Enlightenment ) , the enemy was the Black Guardian , who was last encountered by the fourth incarnation of the Doctor at the conclusion of The Key to Time saga in the 1979 serial The Armageddon Factor . The story also saw the return of the White Guardian , who had also not been seen since 1979 . To date , neither character , nor the Eternals , have appeared in the show again .

 After penning a number of radio and TV scripts , including episodes of Crossroads and Waggoner 's Walk , Barbara Clegg submitted a story idea to Doctor Who script editor Eric Saward , an acquaintance from the BBC drama department . Interested in writing for the series , Clegg had been inspired when distant relatives had stayed with her and demanded constant entertainment during their visit , basing the character of the Eternals upon them . Initially titled The Enlighteners , her submission involved ships racing through space that , with the addition of the Black Guardian sub @-@ plot , eventually evolved into the story as screened . Saward and series producer John Nathan @-@ Turner liked Clegg 's ideas , and they commissioned the script in September 1981 . The first episode was delivered by Clegg in October and the three following episodes arriving in January 1982 . The serial was now scheduled to conclude a three @-@ story trilogy featuring the Black Guardian , and Clegg duly wrote the recurring characters into her scripts . By May 1982 there were problems with a script by Pat Mills , Song of the Space Whale , which had been intended to open the Black Guardian trilogy . Mills ' script was eventually dropped and the production team considered moving The Enlighteners forward in the season to replace it , necessitating considerable re @-@ <unk> . Peter <unk> was eventually commissioned to write Mawdryn Undead to replace The Song of the Space Whale , and The Enlighteners was confirmed as the fifth serial of the season . The first draft of Part One did not contain any of the material concerning the Guardians , and Turlough was a peripheral figure , with the script focussing on the relationship between Marriner and Tegan . With pre @-@ production underway , Saward changed the story title to Enlightenment in September 1982 , a title he felt was more enigmatic . Saward also rewrote portions of the script pertaining to the story @-@ arc , particularly the final confrontation scenes at the end of Part Four . Peter Moffatt had been originally scheduled as the serials director , but following the problems with the Space Whale script he was asked to helm its replacement due to his experience , and so Fiona Cumming was asked to take over Enlightenment . 
 Once production began it became apparent that Part One and Part Two were under @-@ running so more dialogue was written to fill in the time . It was originally intended that the character of Jackson would not reappear after the second episode , but during filming Saward became concerned that it appeared that he had been executed and so he and Clegg rewrote Part Three to include him . Part Three also looked to be under running so scenes from Part Four were brought forward and the final scenes with the Guardians were extended to compensate . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Cumming came up with the idea that the Eternals would not blink and cast actors who she believed could provide detached performances . Cumming recalled Peter Sallis had played a similarly detached character in the 1974 BBC drama The <unk> , and cast him in the role of Striker . Sallis was present during the rehearsals for the serial but when production was delayed he was unavailable for the new filming dates , being committed to filming Last of the Summer Wine and was forced to drop out of the production , being replaced by Keith Barron . Lynda Baron was cast as Captain Wrack , having previously participated in Doctor Who in the 1966 serial The Gunfighters , as the voice that sings the " Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon " heard throughout that story . Tony Caunter , who had previously played Thatcher in The Crusade and Morgan in Colony in Space was given the role of Jackson , with Christopher Brown and David <unk> being cast as Marriner and Wrack 's sidekick Mansell respectively . Similarly to Sallis , David <unk> was unavailable for the revised filming dates in January , so singer Leee John replaced him at short notice , despite having no previous acting experience . 
 Valentine Dyall had originally played the Black Guardian in the 1979 serial The Armageddon Factor , the character 's first appearance in the series , and reprised the role for season 20 , appearing in Mawdryn Undead , Terminus and Enlightenment . Similarly Cyril Luckham reprised the role of the White Guardian , that he had previously played in the 1979 serial The <unk> Operation .

 The interior sets of the boats were not built specifically for the programme , but were pulled together from stock items from various prop warehouses . Cumming had originally hoped to simulate the rocking of the ships by mounting the sets on rollers but the idea was dropped due to costs , with the effect achieved by moving the cameras instead . The photo of Tegan 's Aunt Vanessa , one of the items created by Marriner from the contents of her mind , was shot specifically for the filming , requiring <unk> Whiteman ( who had played the character in Logopolis ) to be contracted for a one @-@ day photoshoot . The models of the boats , used in the racing sequences , were props sourced by visual effects designer Mike Kelt following extensive research at the National Maritime Museum . The ships were mounted on rods for filming , while the oars were battery operated . The model of Davey 's ship remained intact , with explosion being a filmed effect that was edited into the sequence . Kelt was shocked by the dilapidated state of the TARDIS console prop , and was worried about damaging it while filming the explosion from Part One , and asked producer John Nathan @-@ Turner if he could replace it but was told there was no money available . 
 The anachronistic wetsuits on the Edwardian ship were actually heavy @-@ duty overalls that had been painted black . Janet Fielding struggled with the low cut ball @-@ gown she wore during filming as it threatened to expose her breasts on a number of occasions . The ball gown worn by Baron was made especially for the serial and was the most expensive costume on display . The newspaper found by the Doctor in Part One was a reprint of The Times from September 1901 , while the food and drink served during the party scenes was all real . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The serial began principal filming in early November 1982 , with filming divided into two main blocks . The first block was shot on film at Ealing Studios between 3 – 5 November and consisted of the deck scenes and a number of model shots . Actor Mark Strickson was injured while filming the scene of Turlough throwing himself overboard , when the Kirby wire he was suspended from broke , leaving him only able to walk with difficulty for several weeks . The studio work was scheduled to run from 6 November until mid December and consisted of all the interior scenes and those in the TARDIS . By mid @-@ November however the electricians union the <unk> , had begun strike action which disrupted the filming of a number of BBC productions including Enlightenment and potentially meaning the final three serials of the season would have to be abandoned . The electricians dispute was settled by December , but it had badly affected the series recording schedule . The crew were able to shoot the following serial The King 's Demons on schedule , meaning that there was only one recording block left for the part @-@ completed Enlightenment and Eric Saward 's season finale ; The Return . With some filming already completed , and its importance in concluding the Black Guardian story @-@ arc , it was decided that Enlightenment should take precedence and so it had its second production block moved to January 1983 , while The Return was abandoned . Due to the delays , the serial only finished filming around a month before its transmission date , meaning that composer Malcolm Clarke only received the first episode for scoring a week before broadcast , having to rely on musical cues he had recorded weeks earlier without having seen any footage .

 Writer Barbara Clegg based the Eternals on a wealthy group of her relatives , who upon visiting her had demanded constant entertainment , treating other family members almost as " lesser beings " . Clegg also drew inspiration from the Bible 's Book of Genesis , deriving the prize of enlightenment from The Tree of Knowledge within it , while having read about Solar winds she decided to use them as the basis of propulsion for space vessels . Clegg highlighted the nature of enlightenment , showing it not to be knowledge , as the Eternals believe , but wisdom , as demonstrated by Turlough 's rejection of the Black Guardian . 
 The story echoes a recurring theme from the show ; that of bored , god @-@ like beings playing with the lives of mortals for the purpose of amusement . In their book About Time , Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood liken this to a prevalent strand of children 's fiction , where magical worlds are held together by the rules of the children who visit them . Miles and Wood also highlight the political elements of the story , likening the portrayal of the Eternals to the view of the upper classes as " effete parasites feeding off the labour ( and in this case the imagination ) of the <unk> . " The Doctor then , acts as part of the class struggle , helping the workers gain freedom while the gentry get their comeuppance . 
 In his essay Love is a Stranger , published in the first volume of the Doctor Who Magazine — Special Edition , David Bailey highlights the central theme that " ... the lives of little people are precious , special and worth fighting for ... ... the Eternals may have unimaginable power at their fingertips but they lack , and are jealous of , one thing : the ability to live , and die . " The hollowness of immortality was a thread that ran through Season 20 , with the earlier story Mawdryn Undead showing Mawdryn trapped in an endless cycle of painful regeneration , while in The Five Doctors , <unk> 's prize of immortality results in little more than a living death . The horror of eternal life is brought home when the Black Guardian threatens Turlough with immortality as a punishment for failure , something that drives him to try and commit suicide rather than face eternity .

 Reviewing the story for Doctor Who Magazine 's 200 Golden Moments special edition , Jeremy Bentham described it as being epic in scale , suggesting it played to the original strengths of the series ; " performance , period set design and claustrophobic mood ... " . He likens Enlightenment to the work of Stanley Kubrick , saying " ... it felt grand , it felt lonely , and yes , it felt epic . " On reappraising the story for the same magazine following its release on DVD , Gary <unk> was equally as effusive , calling it " ... one of Doctor Who 's finest serials . " He highlights the performance of Keith Barron as Captain Striker as being " a master class of under @-@ stated menace " and " pitch perfect " , juxtaposing this with the over @-@ the @-@ top pantomime villainy of Lynda Baron as Captain Wrack , with the two captains balancing each other out perfectly . 
 Writing for the Radio Times , Mark Braxton was less enamoured of some of the performances , suggesting that Baron and Valentine Dyall turn in ' hammy ' interpretations of their characters , while Leee John " ... makes heavy weather of the simplest activities : helming the ship seems to require the most bizarre posturing . " He had mixed views on the story as a whole , saying that " Enlightenment has promising components that come together and briefly create a little magic , then vanish again , like ships that pass in the night . " DVD Talk 's John Sinnott had similarly mixed views on the serial , although conceding that " ... While it doesn 't all succeed , they give it a good try and more things work than don 't . " Sinnott also singled out the performance of Keith Barron for particular praise , along with the relationship between Marriner and Tegan . 
 In their book About Time , Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood have equally mixed feelings about the serial , praising the setting and the performances of Barron and Brown , and suggesting that it " ... carries on the tradition of putting symbols from the world we know into disconcerting environments ... ... ( it ) completes the grand illusion of making the history and the fantasy feel like part of the same continuum . " They are less complimentary about other elements however , citing the conclusion as feeling " rushed and tacked on " with too much emphasis on the Guardians and little on the fates of the Eternals . They also dismiss the reveal of enlightenment as being the nature of Turlough 's choice , as coming " perilously close to <unk> " and accuse it of being " cod @-@ <unk> moralising " . 
 Enlightenment was placed in 72nd position in Doctor Who Magazine 's Mighty 200 reader survey in 2009 , which ranked every Doctor Who serial to that point in order of preference .

 A novelisation of this serial , written by story author Barbara Clegg , was published by Target Books in May 1984 , with a cover by Andrew <unk> , and was numbered 85 in the ongoing range . It was the first Doctor Who novelisation to be penned by a woman . On its publication Doctor Who Magazine was underwhelmed by the book , claiming in their review that " In many ways , it falls into the familiar Terrance Dicks pitfalls , being a straight forward reworking of the script with " said " following all the speeches . For all its faults , Enlightenment remains a good read , simply because of the strength of the story ... " The book was repackaged as part of The Sixth Doctor Who Gift Set later in 1984 , along with three other Doctor Who novels ; The Dominators , Mawdryn Undead and The Five Doctors .

 Enlightenment was released on VHS in February 1993 . It was subsequently released on DVD as part of the Black Guardian Trilogy , along with preceding stories Mawdryn Undead and Terminus on 10 August 2009 . The second disc of the DVD includes a " Special Edition " version of the story ; a movie @-@ style edit featuring new CGI graphics throughout , with a newly recorded introduction by director Fiona Cumming . Doctor Who Magazine was not enthusiastic about the new edit suggesting , that " ... what is special about it is up for debate . " The reviewer disparaged the new special effects , stating that " ... this is ironic as there are few Doctor Who stories less in need of replacement effects than Enlightenment . The original model work is gorgeous , while this substitute material is crude and unsophisticated in comparison . " Alongside the special edition , the DVD contained a number of extra features , including a Making of ... documentary and extended interviews with director Fiona Cumming , writer Barbara Clegg and actor Mark Strickson , a documentary on the Guardians plus an excerpt from the Russell Harty Christmas Party TV special featuring Peter Davison .

 = Prussian uprisings = 
 The Prussian uprisings were two major and three smaller uprisings by the Prussians , one of the Baltic tribes , against the Teutonic Knights that took place in the 13th century during the Prussian Crusade . The crusading military order , supported by the Popes and Christian Europe , sought to conquer and convert the pagan Prussians . In the first ten years of the crusade five of the seven major Prussian clans fell under the control of the less numerous Teutonic Knights . However , the Prussians rose against their conquerors on five occasions . 
 The first uprising was supported by Duke <unk> II , Duke of Pomerania . The Prussians were successful at first , reducing the Knights to only five of their strongest castles . Conversely , the duke suffered a series of military defeats and was eventually forced to make peace with the Teutonic Knights . With Duke <unk> 's support for the Prussians broken , a prelate of Pope Innocent IV then negotiated a peace treaty between the Prussians and the Knights . However , this treaty was never honored or enforced , especially after the Battle of Krücken at the end of 1249 . 
 The second uprising , known in historiography as " The Great Prussian Uprising " , was prompted by the 1260 Battle of Durbe , the largest defeat suffered by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century . This uprising was the longest , largest , and most threatening to the Teutonic Order , who again were reduced to five of their strongest castles . Reinforcements for the Knights were slow to arrive , despite repeated encouragements from Pope Urban IV , and the position of the Order looked set to worsen . Luckily for the Order , the Prussians lacked unity and a common strategy and reinforcements finally reached Prussia in around 1265 . One by one , Prussian clans surrendered and the uprising was ended in 1274 . 
 The later three lesser uprisings depended on foreign help and were suppressed within one or two years . The last uprising in 1295 effectively ended the Prussian Crusade and Prussia became a Christian German @-@ speaking territory , which assimilated native Prussians and a number of settlers from different German states . 
 = = Background = = 
 Although the Prussians repelled early incursions by the Order of Dobrzyń , they were outnumbered by attacks from Poland , Russians in the southeast and the Teutonic Knights from the west . The Teutonic Order was called to the Culmerland ( Chełmno Land ) in 1226 by Konrad I of Masovia , who started a number of attacks and crusades against the Prussians and later asked the Knights to protect him from retaliatory raids by the Prussians . Preoccupied with crusades in the Holy Land , the Teutonic Knights arrived only in 1230 . Their first task was to build a base on the left bank of Vistula at Vogelsang , opposite of Toruń ( Thorn ) , which was completed a year later . Led by Hermann Balk , the Knights did not repeat the mistakes of the previous Order and did not push eastwards into the forest of the interior . They would further build fortified log ( later brick and stone ) castles along major rivers and the Vistula Lagoon to serve as basis for future expansion . In 1231 – 1242 , forty such castles were built . The Prussians faced major difficulties in capturing these castles as they were accustomed only to battling in open fields . Most conflicts occurred either in summer or winter . Heavily @-@ armoured knights could not travel and fight on land soaked by water from melting snow or autumn rains . Summer campaigns were most dangerous as the Knights would immediately build new castles in the conquered territory . The Teutonic Knight 's strategy proved successful : in ten years , five of the seven major Prussian clans fell under control of the less @-@ numerous Teutonic Knights . However , the Prussians further resisted the conquerors , leading to five uprisings over the following fifty years . 
 = = The First Prussian Uprising ( 1242 – 1249 ) = = 
 The First Prussian Uprising was influenced by three major events . Firstly , the Teutonic Knights lost the Battle of the Ice on Lake Peipus to Alexander Nevsky in April 1242 . Secondly , southern Poland was devastated by a Mongol invasion in 1241 ; Poland lost the Battle of Legnica and the Teutonic Knights lost one of its most trusted allies that often supplied troops . Thirdly , Duke Swantopolk II of Pomerania was fighting against the Knights , who supported his brothers ' dynastic claims against him . It has been implied that the new castles of the Knights were competing with his lands over the trade routes along the Vistula River . While some historians embrace the Swantopolk – Prussian alliance without hesitation , others are more careful . They point out that the historical information came from documents written by the Teutonic Knights and must have been ideologically charged to persuade the Pope to declare a crusade not only against the pagan Prussians but also against the Christian duke . 
 Prussians besieged Teutonic castles and managed to capture all except for Elbing ( Elbląg ) and Balga in the eastern regions of Natangia , Barta and Warmia ; Thorn ( Toruń ) , Culm ( Chełmno ) , and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) in the western parts . In December 1242 , the Knights were able to capture <unk> , Swantopolk 's castle on the banks of the Vistula . The ensuing five @-@ week siege of <unk> failed to recapture the fortress and Swantopolk lost 900 men . In the spring of 1243 , Swantopolk also lost the castle at <unk> ( <unk> nad <unk> ) , which dominated trade on the Noteć River . In the face of these losses , the duke was forced to make short @-@ lived truce . In the summer of 1243 , Prussians with <unk> help raided the Culmerland ( Chełmno Land ) and , on their way back , defeated the pursuing Teutonic Knights on June 15 on the banks of the Osa River . Some 400 Teutonic soldiers perished , including their marshal . Swantopolk , encouraged by the defeat , gathered an army of 2 @,@ 000 men and unsuccessfully besieged Culm ( Chełmno ) . 
 The Teutonic Knights managed to gather a coalition against Swantopolk : Dukes of Masovia were given territories in Prussia , Dukes of Greater Poland received <unk> , and Dukes of <unk> , brothers of Swantopolk , hoped to regain their inheritance . Swantopolk built a castle at <unk> , where <unk> separated from the Vistula , and launched a blockade of Elbing and Balga . While the castle withstood Teutonic attacks , the blockade was smashed by cogs . In late 1245 <unk> 's army suffered a great defeat at S ( ch ) <unk> Świecie , and another one in early 1246 , where 1 @,@ 500 Pomeranians were killed . Swantopolk II asked for truce and Pope Innocent IV appointed his chaplain , Jacob of Liège , the future Pope Urban IV , to handle the peace negotiations . However , the war was renewed in 1247 when large Teutonic reinforcements arrived in Prussia . On Christmas Eve of 1247 the Knights besieged and overwhelmed a major <unk> fortress , which they later renamed Christburg ( <unk> ) , and newly arrived Henry III , Margrave of Meissen subdued the Pogesanians . Swantopolk retaliated and destroyed Christburg , but the Knights rebuilt it in a new location . Both Prussian and Swantopolk 's armies failed to capture the new castle . Otto III of Brandenburg raided Warmia and Natangia forcing the locals to surrender . 
 The peace talks that begun in 1247 achieved little , but a new truce was arranged in September 1248 and peace was made on November 24 , 1248 . Swantopolk had to return lands seized from his brothers , allow Teutonic Knights to pass through his domains , stop charging tolls on ships using the Vistula , and stop any aid to the Prussians . Prussians were compelled to sign the Treaty of Christburg on February 7 , 1249 . The treaty provided personal freedom and rights to newly converted Christians . It formally ended the uprising , but already in November 1249 the Natangians defeated the Knights at the Battle of Krücken . The skirmishes lasted until 1253 and some sources cite this year as the end of the uprising . At that point the treaty ceased its political power but remained an interesting historical document . 
 = = The Great Prussian Uprising ( 1260 – 1274 ) = = 
 = = = Preparation and tactics = = = 
 The major revolt began on September 20 , 1260 . It was triggered by the Lithuanian and Samogitian military victory against the joint forces of the Livonian Order and Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Durbe . As the uprising was spreading through Prussian lands , each clan chose a leader : the Sambians were led by <unk> , the Natangians by Herkus Monte , the Bartians by <unk> , the Warmians by Glappe , the Pogesanians by <unk> . One clan that did not join the uprising was the <unk> . The uprising was also supported by Skalmantas , leader of the Sudovians . However , there was no one leader to coordinate efforts of these different forces . Herkus Monte , who was educated in Germany , became the best known and most successful of the leaders , but he commanded only his Natangians . 
 The Prussians besieged the many castles that the Knights had built and could not send large armies to fight in the west . Prussians were not familiar with Western European siege tactics and machinery and relied on siege forts , built around the castle , to cut the supplies to the garrisons . The Teutonic Knights could not raise large armies to deliver supplies to the starving garrisons and smaller castles began to fall . Those castles were usually destroyed and the Prussians manned just a few castles , notably one in Heilsberg ( <unk> <unk> ) , because they lacked technology to defend the captured castles and organization to provide food and supplies to stationed garrisons . On August 29 , 1261 Jacob of Liège , who negotiated the Treaty of Christburg after the first uprising , was elected as Pope Urban IV . He , having an inside scope on events in Prussia , was especially favourable to the Teutonic Knights and issued 22 papal bulls in three years of his papacy calling for reinforcements to the Knights . However , the reinforcements were slow to come as dukes of Poland and Germany were preoccupied with their own disputes and the Livonian Order was fighting the <unk> uprising . 
 = = = Early Prussian success = = = 
 The first reinforcement to the Teutonic forces arrived in early 1261 , but was wiped out on January 21 , 1261 by Herkus Monte in the Battle of <unk> . In January 1262 reinforcements arrived from the Rhineland , led by Wilhelm VII , Duke of Jülich , who was obliged by Pope Alexander IV to fulfil his crusader duties in Prussia . This army broke the Siege of Königsberg but as soon as the army returned home , the Sambians resumed the siege and were reinforced by Herkus Monte and his Natangians . Herkus was later injured and the Natangians retreated , leaving the Sambians unable to stop supplies reaching the castle and the siege eventually failed . Prussians were more successful capturing castles deeper into the Prussian territory ( with an exception of Wehlau , now <unk> ) , and the Knights were left only with strongholds in Balga , Elbing , Culm , Thorn , and Königsberg . Most castles fell in 1262 – 1263 , and Bartenstein fell in 1264 . The Prussians destroyed captured forts instead of using them for their own defence , so the end of successful sieges meant that large Prussian forces did not have to stay near their home and were then free to operate in other parts of Prussia , raiding the Culmerland and Kuyavia . 
 A recovered Herkus Monte raided Culmerland with a large force and took many prisoners in 1263 . On his way back to Natangia , Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their enemies . In the Battle of Löbau that ensued , Prussians killed forty knights , including the Master and the Marshal . The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians . In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia , killing Duke Siemowit I , and raided Culmerland , provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising . However , assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns . Skalmantas , leader of Sudovians , raided Culm ( Chełmno ) in 1263 and in 1265 . 
 = = = Turning point = = = 
 The year of 1265 was the turning point in the uprising : more substantial reinforcements for the Teutonic Knights finally started arriving in Prussia and Sambia gave up the fight . Teutonic castles in Königsberg and Wehlau on the Pregel River cut off the region from the rest of Prussia . Supplies to Königsberg were brought by sea , and the castle served as the basis for raids in surrounding Samland ( Sambia ) . The Livonian Order sent troops to Königsberg and the joint forces defeated the Sambians in a decisive battle forcing them to surrender . In 1265 reinforcements arrived from Germany : armies of Duke Albrecht of Braunschweig and Margrave Albert of Meissen arrived in Prussia , but were unable to achieve much . In 1266 Otto III and John I , co @-@ rulers of Brandenburg , built a castle in the Natangian lands between Balga and Königsberg and named it Brandenburg ( since 1945 Ushakovo ) . Due to bad weather they did not organize campaigns into Prussian lands . 
 When the Dukes returned home , Brandenburg was captured by Glappe and his Warmians . The very next year Otto returned to rebuild the castle . However , both John and Otto died before the end of 1267 , and Otto 's son was killed in a tournament . Subsequent Dukes of Brandenburg were not as supportive of the Knights . In 1266 Duke Swantopolk , the supporter of the Prussians during the First Uprising , died and his sons <unk> and <unk> briefly joined the Prussians in the uprising . In 1267 King Ottokar II of Bohemia , who already participated in the Prussian Crusade in 1254 and who was promised by Pope Urban IV all Prussian lands he could conquer , finally arrived in Prussia . His only achievement was forcing Duke <unk> to reconcile with the Teutonic Knights . His large army was unable to campaign due to an early thaw : heavily armed knights could hardly fight during the wet and swampy spring season . 
 The warfare with the Prussians relied on guerilla raids in the border regions . Small groups of men , a dozen to a hundred , made quick raids on farms , villages , border posts , etc . This was a positional warfare where neither side could defeat the other , but the Teutonic Knights relied on future reinforcements from Germany and Europe , while Prussians were draining their local resources . After the massacre of surrendered Teutonic soldiers in the Battle of Krücken in 1249 , the Knights refused to negotiate with the Prussians . The Prussians were also unable to coordinate their efforts and develop a common strategy : while each clan had its own leader , there was no one to lead all the clans . The Natangians had to watch for attacks from Balga , Brandenburg , Wehlau , and Königsberg while the Warmians were threatened by garrisons at Christburg and Elbing . This way only Diwane and his Bartians were able to continue the war in the west . They made several minor expeditions to Culmerland each year . 
 = = = The end of the uprising = = = 
 The major Prussian offensive was organized in 1271 together with Linka , leader of the Pogesanians . The <unk> infantry and Pogesanians besieged a border castle , but were fended off by the Knights from Christburg . The Prussians who managed to escape joined their cavalry while the Knights set up a camp on the opposite bank of the <unk> River ( <unk> River ) , blocking the route home . When Christians retired for the night , one half of the Prussian army crossed the river in a distance , in order to attack the Knights from the rear , while the other half charged straight across the river . The Knights were encircled . The Battle of <unk> saw twelve knights and 500 men killed . The Prussians immediately assaulted Christburg and almost captured it . The Prussians were still looting the surrounding area when cavalry from Elbing arrived . Many of the Prussian infantry perished while cavalry escaped . Despite these losses , Diwane was soon back and blocked roads leading to Christburg hoping to starve the castle . Diwane was killed during a siege of a small post at <unk> ( <unk> ) in 1273 . 
 In the winter of 1271 – 1272 reinforcements arrived from Meissen , led by Count Dietrich II . The army invaded Natangia and besieged an unnamed Natangian castle . While the assault claimed 150 lives of the crusaders , most of Natangian resistance was broken and the region was decimated . Herkus Monte , with a small group of his followers , was forced to withdraw to the forests of southern Prussia . Within a year he was finally captured and hanged . The last Prussian leader , Glappe of Warmians , was also hanged when his siege campaign on Brandenburg ( now Ushakovo ) was attacked from the rear . The last tribe standing were the Pogesanians , who made a surprise raid into Elbing and ambushed its garrison . In 1274 the Knights made a great expedition to avenge this raid , capturing the rebel headquarters at Heilsberg ( <unk> <unk> ) and ending the uprising . 
 The Knights proceeded to rebuild and strengthen castles destroyed by the Prussians . A number of Prussians escaped either to <unk> or to Lithuania , or were resettled by the Knights . Many free peasants were made into serfs . Local nobles had to convert and give hostages , and only a few of them were granted privileges to retain their noble status . From 1274 to 1283 the Teutonic Knights conquered Skalvians , Nadruvians , and Sudovians / Yotvingians . 
 = = Further uprisings and aftermath = = 
 After the Great Uprising , the Prussians rose a number of times against the Knights , but these uprisings were much smaller in scale and posed no real danger to the Teutonic Knights , who could concentrate on further conquests . The number of uprisings is variously considered to be two or three .. They were suppressed within a year or two and showed exhaustion and division of the Prussian tribes . The third uprising in 1276 was provoked by Skalmantas , leader of the Sudovians , who successfully raided Teutonic lands . The next year he , with help from the Lithuanians , led 4 @,@ 000 men into the Culmerland ( Chełmno Land ) . The uprising failed to spread after Theodoric , <unk> of Sambia , convinced the Sambians not to join the insurrection ; Natangians and Warmians had also accepted baptism and promised their loyalty to the Knights . The Pogesanians alone continued the fight and were crushed . Survivors with their <unk> chief escaped to Hrodna in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania where they joined some of the Bartians , Skalvians , and all of the Nadruvians , who fled there after the Great Uprising . 
 The last two Prussian attempts to rid itself of the Teutonic rule were made relying on the foreign powers who were enemies of the Knights . The first one in 1286 , also known as the fourth uprising , depended upon help from the Duke of Rügen , the grandson of Swantopolk . The plot was soon revealed and the Bartians and Pogesanians suffered the consequences . In 1295 the last uprising was limited to Natangia and Sambia and depended upon help from Vytenis , Grand Duke of Lithuania . The rebels captured Bartenstein ( <unk> ) by surprise and plundered as far as Königsberg , but were never a serious threat . By that time Prussian nobility was already baptized and pro @-@ Teutonic to the extent that peasants killed them first before attacking the Knights . 
 This last attempt effectively ended the Prussian Crusade and the Knights concentrated on conquering Samogitia and Lithuania . Lithuanian historians note that fierce resistance by the Prussians won time for the young Lithuanian state to mature and strengthen so it could withstand the hundred @-@ year crusade , culminating in the 1410 Battle of Grunwald , with minimal territorial losses . The Prussian lands were repopulated by colonists from Germany , who after the 16th century eventually outnumbered the natives . It is estimated that around 1400 Prussians numbered 100 @,@ 000 and comprised about half of the total population in Prussia . The Prussians were subject to Germanization and assimilation and eventually became extinct sometime after the 16th century . It is believed that the Prussian language became extinct sometime at the beginning of the 18th century . 
 = Amy 's Choice ( Doctor Who ) = 
 " Amy 's Choice " is the seventh episode in the fifth series of British science fiction television series Doctor Who , first broadcast on BBC One on 15 May 2010 . It was written by sitcom writer Simon Nye and directed by Catherine Morshead . 
 In the episode , lead characters the Doctor , a time travelling alien played by Matt Smith , and his human travelling companions Amy ( Karen Gillan ) and her fiancé Rory ( Arthur Darvill ) , are in a trap set by the mysterious " Dream Lord " ( Toby Jones ) , wherein they repeatedly fall asleep and wake up in a different reality . In one , Amy and Rory are happily married but pursued by elderly people possessed by aliens , while in another they are on board the Doctor 's time machine , the TARDIS , where they anticipate being frozen to death by a nearby astronomical phenomenon . They must decide which is the real reality and die in the dream , to wake up in reality and escape the trap . At the episode 's conclusion , the Dream Lord is ultimately revealed to be a manifestation of the Doctor 's dark side and self @-@ loathing . 
 Nye wrote the episode to explore and to test Amy 's relationships with both the Doctor and Rory . Showrunner Steven Moffat suggested that Nye , a comedy writer by trade , build the episode around a split dream concept , and encouraged Nye to create a " monster " for the episode , which influenced his writing of the retirement home dream . The dream scenes in Amy and Rory 's village was filmed in Skenfrith , Wales and used CGI and prosthetics . " Amy 's Choice " was seen by 7 @.@ 55 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD and received generally mixed reviews from critics . The most positive praised the episode 's surrealism and commended it as one of the year 's strongest scripts , but other reviewers felt the episode 's horror or monsters unsatisfying .

 The Doctor , Amy , and Rory find themselves flickering between two realities , falling asleep at the sound of birdsong in one and waking in the other . In the first reality , Amy and Rory stopped travelling with the Doctor five years previously , are happily married , and Amy is heavily pregnant . They find themselves in their hometown of Leadworth being chased by the Eknodine , an alien race that have disguised themselves as the elderly of the town . The Eknodine are able to turn anyone into dust by blowing a poisonous liquid on them . In the other reality , they are trapped in the powerless TARDIS drifting towards a freezing cold star which will kill them . During one of their experiences in the TARDIS @-@ reality they are met by the " Dream Lord " , an apparition who tells them that he has created a dream reality in contrast to their actual reality . The three must determine which is the dream reality and kill themselves in it to return to the other reality . However , if they choose wrong they will be killed in both . 
 The Dream Lord keeps Amy awake in the TARDIS reality while the Doctor and Rory fall asleep and return to the Leadworth reality . The Dream Lord questions Amy as to whom she would choose between Rory and the Doctor . He states that she must choose between the worlds ; one leads to a peaceful married life with Rory while the other leads to adventure and excitement with the Doctor . Amy returns to Leadworth and rejoins Rory in defending her house from the Eknodine whilst the Doctor is trying to rescue people from Leadworth in a motor @-@ caravan . As Amy believes she is going into labour , Rory is sprayed by the Eknodine and turns to dust . Amy decides that she is willing to risk her own life for the chance of seeing Rory again and concludes the Leadworth reality is false . Amy and the Doctor drive the motor @-@ caravan into the house , leading to their assumed deaths . The three wake up again on the TARDIS where they are congratulated by the Dream Lord , who then reactivates the TARDIS . After the Dream Lord 's departure Amy and Rory are surprised by the Doctor when he directs the TARDIS to self @-@ destruct , apparently killing them all . 
 The three wake up again on the TARDIS , no longer in any danger . The Doctor realises both realities were false since the Dream Lord had no power over the real world and was a manifestation of his darker side . The three were influenced by psychic pollen that had fallen in the TARDIS time rotor and heated up , creating the Dream Lord and the false realities . Rory comes to realise that Amy killed herself in the Leadworth reality out of love for him , and the two confess their love for each other . The Doctor sees the Dream Lord smile at him through his reflection .

 The Dream Lord describes the Doctor sarcastically as " The <unk> Storm " , a name coined by his archenemies the Daleks , and first mentioned in the Seventh Doctor novel Love and War and subsequently on @-@ screen in " The Parting of the Ways " , where it was attributed to the Daleks . He also says to the Doctor , " You 're probably a vegetarian ! " in a butcher 's shop and calls him " veggie " , referring to The Two Doctors , in which the Sixth Doctor announced that he and Peri would eat a vegetarian diet from then on . The Dream Lord also teases the Doctor 's relationship with Elizabeth I. This began in " The Shakespeare Code " where Elizabeth I wished to behead the Doctor and continued in The End of Time , which alluded to the possibility the two were married . The marriage between the two was seen 3 years later in " The Day of the Doctor " .

 " Amy 's Choice " was written by Simon Nye , who is known for writing the sitcom Men Behaving Badly . Nye attended read @-@ throughs of previous episodes to capture the character and " voice " of the Doctor and Amy . Nye admitted to restraining himself in the change from comedy to science fiction , but said it was " fun " and " hugely liberating " . Showrunner Steven Moffat originally gave Nye the premise of the episode for it to fit in the series arc , which was to challenge the Doctor and Amy 's relationship . Nye states that Rory 's " death " scene is essentially where Amy realises her feelings for Rory . Nye wanted to prove that Amy really loved Rory , and he was " not just a cypher boyfriend or fiancé " . 
 Moffat suggested the idea of the dream split to Nye , who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they were real . Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who . Moffat also instructed Nye to come up with a monster , and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine , reflecting his own fear of old people as a child , but he made clear that he did not intend to make children scared of their grandparents .

 " Amy 's Choice " was the last episode of the fifth series to be filmed , and the editing finished the week it aired . The read @-@ through for the episode took place on 17 February 2010 in the Upper Boat Studios along with the read @-@ through for episode eleven , marking the final two read @-@ throughs for the series . The dream sequences taking place in the fictional town of Upper Leadworth were filmed in Skenfrith , Wales . 
 Karen Gillan had to wear a latex prosthetic stomach bump for the scenes which depicted Amy as pregnant . She claimed it made her feel more mature and act ridiculously , and cited it as her favourite part of filming the series . Arthur Darvill wore a wig for the aged Rory , which was trimmed to look " more masculine " and pulled back in a ponytail . The Eknodine were CGI and the scenes were simply filmed with the actors opening their mouths . The scene in which Rory hits Eknodine @-@ inhabited Mrs Hamil with a plank was filmed first of all with Darvill missing actress Joan Linder , and then again with Linder 's stunt double , whom he was allowed to hit . There was only one prop of the plank , and fortunately all the necessary shots were completed before Darvill accidentally broke it .

 " Amy 's Choice " received generally mixed reviews from critics . Gavin Fuller , writing for The Daily Telegraph , was positive about the episode , calling it " probably the strongest all @-@ round script we 've had this year , chock full of good lines " . He added , " The concept of aliens inhabiting elderly people and turning them psychotic was wittily realised , particularly the bizarre sight of them laying siege to Amy and Rory 's cottage with household and gardening implements " . He concluded that it " was one of those stories that you would only find in Doctor Who , and shows once again that the series can provide genuine thought @-@ provoking , interesting drama alongside its thrills and spills " . 
 Matt Wales of IGN rated the episode 8 @.@ 5 out of 10 and described it as " surreal , fantastical , intriguing , witty , emotional and , at times , genuinely unsettling " . Unlike Martin , he said it was " impressive enough on pacing alone " and made a " brisk , refreshing 45 @-@ minute episode " . However , he criticised the ending for being " glossed over so quickly " and found Upper Leadworth hard to believe . Keith Phipps , writing on The A.V. Club , graded the episode a B and stated it was " a solid ... entry in what 's been a generally terrific season of Doctor Who " . He praised Toby Jones ' performance as the Dream Lord , saying that " in lesser hands , he might have come off as a copycat version of Star Trek 's Q , but Jones makes the part his own " . However , he thought its weakness was the pace and " the retirement home @-@ dwelling bad guys , who ultimately seem like a geriatric , and not that frightening , variation on the same old shambling zombies . " 
 Daniel Martin , reviewing the episode for The Guardian , described it as " at least partially successful " . He praised Karen Gillan 's performance , saying that she " is capable of more than one @-@ liners and physical comedy – and brings something to your eye , too " . However , he thought that the episode lacked ideas and storylines usually found in the show , and criticised the sitcom @-@ style dialogue . Patrick Mulkern , writing for the Radio Times , was " distinctly underwhelmed " , comparing it to " one of the more disappointing episodes of The Sarah Jane Adventures " . He " particularly disliked the demonising of elderly people " . Upon rewatching , however , although " previous gripes " remained , he did appreciate some the " more subdued " background music from Murray Gold , the script 's " tight structure and several amusing lines " , and " the realisation that , for the first time , the Doctor is travelling with a couple in love " . 
 SFX Magazine 's Jordan Farley gave the episode 3 and a half out of 5 stars , saying the direction " never quite [ struck ] the right balance between absurdist humour and sinister nightmare " and the camera was " a little flat " with a strange angle . He was displeased with the discovery that it had all been a hallucination and stated that Rory 's death and other instances of horror " never shock in the way you might expect " . However , he praised Smith for being " on blindingly good form " while portraying the Doctor 's quirkier traits , considered that Gillan and Darvill were " fast becoming the most likeable companion couple in Doctor Who history " , and said Jones was " a lot of fun to watch " despite not seeming to be completely the Doctor 's dark side .

 Project M is a video game modification ( mod ) of the 2008 fighting game Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii , created by the community group known as the Project M Development Team ( PMDT or <unk> Team ; previously known as the Project M Back Room ) . It is designed to retool Brawl to play more like its two predecessors , Super Smash Bros. ( 1999 ) and Super Smash Bros. Melee ( 2001 ) , in response to fan objections to Brawl 's physics , slower @-@ paced gameplay , larger use of chance elements , and mechanics of certain attacks . Project M brings back the characters Mewtwo and Roy , who were present in Melee but did not return for Brawl . In addition , it features a new art style for in @-@ game menus and allows players to choose certain characters individually when they are only accessible as extensions of other ones in Brawl . 
 Development started in early 2010 with the goals of reworking the character Falco Lombardi to play like his Melee incarnation and increasing the accessibility of the gameplay style , but the project quickly evolved to a full @-@ scale reworking of Brawl . The game 's first demo build was released on February 7 , 2011 , and development continued until December 1 , 2015 , when the mod 's development team announced it would cease further development of Project M. The game has received positive comments from reviewers , amassed a player base of over 500 @,@ 000 , surpassed three million downloads , and been played in many professional tournaments .

 Super Smash Bros. Brawl , which Project M modifies , is a fighting game with an unconventional battle system . Players battle in arenas of varying sizes and levels of complexity , controlling characters with a variety of play styles . They can attack one another with their own repertoires of special moves , or with a basic attack . Attacks can be avoided by jumping or using a short @-@ lived shield move . Unlike most fighting games , Brawl does not include standard health gauges , but a percentage counter ; there is no point at which a character is automatically knocked out from the counter getting too high , but they will be knocked farther with increasing damage . Being knocked off the screen — or falling off oneself — causes a knock @-@ out . Players may use items for offensive purposes , such as guns and swords , or for healing purposes , such as food and heart containers . The stages , characters , and items are drawn from Nintendo 's video game franchises such as Mario , Pokémon , The Legend of Zelda , and Metroid , along with Sega 's Sonic the Hedgehog series and Konami 's Metal Gear series . The victor of a match has no standard determining factor . Rather , depending on the settings , victory may be reached , for example , by being the last player alive using a stock system , or by achieving the most KOs after a set amount of time . 
 Super Smash Bros. Melee , Brawl 's predecessor in the Super Smash Bros. series , has a similar gameplay style , but there are major differences in areas such as control , general movement styles , and character balancing . Project M was designed to incorporate elements of Melee while still being distinctive in its own right . The designers ' " about " page lists a number of aspects from Melee that they aimed to carry over , including fast @-@ paced gameplay , " flowing , natural movement " , a " great deal of control " in the player 's movements , a balance of offense and defense — though they favored offense over defense slightly — and a complex system of combo attacks . In addition , some characters who had been present in Melee but scrapped for Brawl were brought back . The game files can be downloaded from its official website and exported to the player 's console via an SD card . Players who own an NTSC Wii can install the game without any software modifications , but they must delete all custom stages created in Brawl because of the way files are stored .

 A large number of competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee players were disappointed upon the release of its sequel Brawl six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years after the release of Melee . The general consensus among competitive players was that the latter game 's developers had reworked the older battling system to better appeal to casual gamers , by making the attacks and movement of the game significantly slower in general and adding a greater degree of randomness , luck , and unpredictability , in contrast to Melee , which has more straightforward , skill @-@ based gameplay . Of particular infamy was a new " tripping " mechanic , by which a character occasionally and randomly slips and falls when changing their direction while running . 
 Project M first began as a development project to rework the character Falco to play like his older incarnation in Super Smash Bros. Melee . The designers ' goal at the time was for the game to be accessible to newcomers and encourage people to get better at the game , which was accomplished by creating a character roster that is more balanced . The mod 's first demo was announced on January 15 , 2011 , with a release date of late January or early February in time for the Pound 5 tournament , where it was featured . It featured 14 of the 39 characters in Super Smash Bros. Brawl , as well as new stages Brawl had not included . It was later given a solid date of February 7 , 2011 . A patch was later created to fix the demo 's bugs and fine @-@ tune the player 's control of their movement direction after being attacked . 
 By the release of the game 's second demo in March 2011 , the team 's goals for the mod had expanded to a total overhaul of Brawl to better match Melee 's gameplay mechanics . A newer build added 11 characters and was first playable at the Genesis 2 tournament . The second demo , released on April 15 , 2012 , added four new characters as well as more stages and changes in multiple characters ' gameplay mechanics . Players of this second demo reported a number of bugs , but these were fixed shortly afterwards in version 2 @.@ 1 . A demo version numbered 2 @.@ 5 was announced on September 10 , 2012 ; it featured changes such as balance updates , aesthetic improvements , stage updates , and palette swaps for the characters . Version 2 @.@ 5 was released on December 28 . 
 Originally as part of an April Fool 's Day joke , the PMDT announced that a new " Turbo mode " — inspired by a YouTube video called " Melee Impossible " that showed off powerful combos — would be featured in the upcoming version 3 @.@ 0 . The designers set up a Turbo Tuesday video series showing off the mode with various characters , such as Mario and Ike , once a week . A 2 @.@ 6 demo was announced on June 26 , 2013 , and it was released on July 17 , 2013 . The designers hoped to feature the Turbo mode in this update , but it was not ready in time . The designers added a " Clone Engine " to the game that allowed them to make the character Roy ( whose only appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series at the time was in Melee ) . They designed Roy by taking a clone of a pre @-@ existing character and changing the clone into the desired result , along with using the same use of the engine to make the character Mewtwo but with major edits to its model ( due to it and Lucario having different movesets ) . The designers explained that they would not use this to make characters such as those who first appear in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in order to avoid cease @-@ and @-@ desist letters from Nintendo . The designers added new alternate costumes for a number of characters , including Dr. Mario , who was previously cut from Brawl , for Mario . It was given a release date of December 9 , 2013 , and a final character count of 41 ( more than any previous Super Smash Bros. game at the time ) . Senior designer Corey Archer stated that there would probably be only one more update before he considers Project M complete ; he suggested that this update may contain new Nintendo characters . 
 Version 3 @.@ 5 was released on November 14 , 2014 . This revision refines the game 's user interface , adds new stages and costumes , adds a few new original musical pieces , redesigns several stages from the original Super Smash Bros. using new HD visuals , and implements new modes such as a debug mode and " All @-@ Star Versus , " a mode allowing players to use a different character on every life . A public beta of Version 3 @.@ 6 was released on June 23 , 2015 . It added more costumes and stages , new music , a new in @-@ game announcer , and the ability for players to choose between the modified and unmodified versions of stages before battle among other changes . This was the first non @-@ demo version of Project M which has had a public beta before final release . Version 3 @.@ 6 was officially released on August 16 , 2015 and included even more additional content on top of what was present in the Beta release . Included were additional balance stages , a brand new Wario Land stage , more music , a new announcer to replace the one used in the Beta and various tweaks and fixes to bugs and errors found during the 3 @.@ 6 Beta period . 
 On December 1 , 2015 , the PMDT announced it would cease further development of Project M , effective immediately , in favor of beginning development on an original project . The development team denied allegations that legal threats from Nintendo were the cause of the project 's termination . According to the team 's attorney and business consultant , Ryan Morrison , the decision was not made as a result of a cease @-@ and @-@ desist notice or legal action by Nintendo . One member of the development team stated that the mod 's cancellation was to prevent future legal issues .

 Project M includes a number of adjustments and tweaks intended to make the characters from Super Smash Bros. Melee and Brawl more balanced , as well as add touches that felt more true to their games of origin . For example , the staff felt that the character Wario in Brawl took too much influence from the WarioWare series of games and not enough from his older appearances in Wario Land series of games , so they changed him to better reflect the Wario Land games . Mario was redesigned to be a cross between his Melee incarnation and his heavier @-@ hitting clone from the same game , Dr. Mario . Peach was changed to make her turnip attacks more similar to Melee than Brawl , after Brawl 's advent had diminished their usefulness . Bowser , a character who was generally not considered viable for tournament play in previous games , was given armor and increased attack power and made larger . This gave him the ability to reach enemies easier while making him an easier target for opponents . Yoshi was given an improved recovery and defense . While Ganondorf 's strength was changed to function closer to that of his Melee counterpart , his neutral special has also been changed to a floating descent in the air and a backhand to deflect projectiles on the ground . Additionally , the characters Mewtwo and Roy , who had been present in Melee but were cut from the cast in Brawl , were added back to the roster and given new abilities to make the previously low @-@ tier characters more viable .

 The game has received positive attention from the media . Ryan Rigney of Wired called it the best iteration of Super Smash Bros. and felt that it successfully transforms Brawl into a serious competitive game . Similarly , Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku called it the " best Smash Bros. mod around " and remarked that it " improves the game so much , it practically seems new . " Jordan Devore of Destructoid stated that it was one of the highest @-@ quality mods he had ever seen . Zach <unk> from GamesRadar called the game " beautiful " and enjoyed the presence of " many edits that will make the average Smash fan squeal " . 
 Mentioning Project M on the official Nintendo Miiverse Internet forum will result in an automatic ban for discussing " criminal content " . 
 = Boys ' Ranch = 
 Boys ' Ranch was a six @-@ issue American comic book series created by the veteran writer @-@ artist team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby for Harvey Comics in 1950 . A Western in the then @-@ prevalent " kid gang " vein popularized by such film series as " Our Gang " and " The Dead End Kids " , the series starred three adolescents — Dandy , Wabash , and Angel — who operate a ranch that was bequeathed to them , under the adult supervision of frontiersman Clay Duncan . Supporting characters included Palomino Sue , Wee Willie Weehawken , citizens of the town Four Massacres , and various Native Americans , including a fictional version of the real @-@ life Geronimo . 
 Noted for its use of single and double @-@ page illustrations , the series has been lauded as one of Simon and Kirby 's most significant creations . It was briefly revived through reprints in 1955 , and all six issues were reprinted in a hardcover edition by Marvel Comics in 1991 with an introduction by Jim Simon . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 Western @-@ style adventures involving boys in ranch settings were already present in American popular culture with the juvenile fiction of authors such as Frank V. Webster and Dale Wilkins as well as the 1946 MGM film , Boys ' Ranch . By the late 1940s , the writer @-@ artist team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby was enjoying the commercial success of the duo 's Young Romance and Young Love romance comics titles , and had formed a studio that employed artists such as Mort Meskin , Steve Ditko , John Prentice , Marvin Stein , Bruno <unk> , George Roussos , Bill <unk> , and others . In 1950 , Simon & Kirby launched two new titles : Black Magic , for the Crestwood Publications imprint Prize Comics , and Boys ' Ranch for Harvey Comics ( which had previously published two short @-@ lived Simon – Kirby titles , Stuntman and the Boy Explorers , in 1946 ) . 
 According to a biographical page in one of the issues , Simon and Kirby claimed they had spent ten years researching what became Boys Ranch , traveling to Texas , Wyoming , and Arkansas . They were influenced by the films of early western actor and director William S. Hart . They had previously created the successful kid @-@ gang features the Newsboy Legion and Boy Commandos for DC Comics . 
 Simon in his autobiography recounted a casual meeting in September 1950 with Superman co @-@ creator Jerry Siegel , who had dropped by Harvey Comics ' offices , and showing Siegel art from various upcoming series : 
 I reasoned it would do no harm to show him our products , since they were already in production . ... He lingered on the Boys ' Ranch art . ' This is really a coincidence , ' he said ... ' I 'm working on the same <unk> 
 <unk> ? ' I said . ' I 'd like to see what you 've done on it.' 
 <unk> 'll be in touch , ' Jerry said . We shook hands and he departed . 
 Almost immediately after our Boys ' Ranch went on sale , Harvey received a letter from Ziff @-@ Davis Publications [ for whom Siegel was working ] accusing us of lifting the idea of Boys ' Ranch from Jerry Siegel . [ Harvey Comics head ] Alfred Harvey requested to see their version . They had nothing to show . The matter ended there . 
 Launched in the wave of a western trend in American comic books , the series debuted with an October 1950 cover date as a 52 @-@ page , bimonthly series . It lasted six issues ( Oct. 1950 – Aug. 1951 ) . The original cover title was The Kid Cowboys of Boys ' Ranch , shortened to Boys ' Ranch after two issues ; the subhead " Featuring Clay Duncan " remained throughout . Each issue featured a single page pinup at the beginning of the book along with a two @-@ page <unk> . Each issue rounded off with various text and Western and Native American information pages such as " Boys ' Ranch Club News " , " How Cowboys Say It " , " How To Ride a Horse " , and " Now You Can Make Your Pair of Western <unk> " . 
 According to Harry <unk> , Boys ' Ranch comprises two distinct groups . " The first three issues featured work by Kirby ( with one exception ) , had three stories per issue , and the stories were longer . For the final issues there is much less use of Kirby , only two stories per issue , and shorter stories . Actually each final issue had a single story , but broken into two chapters . " The first three issues average around thirty story pages ; the last three issues average about twenty . The last three feature special " theme " stories , the US Cavalry Army , the Pony Express , the Great Train Robbery . At least one of the themes was inspired by John Ford films ; issue # 4 was thought to show an influence from Ford 's ' Cavalry Trilogy ' . Besides Simon and Kirby , Mort Meskin , Marvin Stein , and Charles Nicholas are credited as contributors in the latter issues , with Meskin given pencil and inks credits on " I 'll fight you for Lucy ! " and inks over Kirby pencils on " The Bugle Blows at Bloody Knife . "

 The title was briefly revived through reprints in 1955 . Penrod Shoes issued a giveaway coeval edition of Boys ' Ranch # 5 and # 6 , and the same issues were reprinted by Harvey Thriller in Witches Western Tales ( 1955 ) # 29 – 30 , with further reprints in Western Tales # 31 – 32 . 
 Marvel Comics published Kid Cowboys of Boys Ranch , a hardcover reprint edition of all six issues in 1991 ( ISBN <unk> ) .

 Clay Duncan is an Indian scout who serves as foreman at the Boys ' Ranch . Modelled on frontiersman such as Kit Carson , Buffalo Bill Cody , and Davy Crockett , he serves as role model to the boy characters . While a young child , Duncan 's parents were killed by bandits . He was rescued by a passing band of Apache Indians , and adopted by the Apache Running Bear , alongside his son , Geronimo . On reaching manhood , he left the Apache under the tutelage of Miles Freeman , a frontier scout . Running Bear 's parting words were ' The war clouds darken once more over the white man and the Indian nations ... there is much need for warriors who talk peace to both sides ! Freeman 's words are that the great spirit has given you to us for such a mission ' . He occasionally takes on other jobs such as army scout , mail delivery driver , and US Marshal . His horse 's name is Ghost . 
 Dandy is a ' well @-@ liked kid with a ready smile and a confident air ' who served in the American Civil War . Usually depicted wearing a Union Army uniform , he left his adoptive parents from a small Ohio farm to explore the west . He has a noticeably greater active interest in the opposite sex , as exemplified in " I 'll fight you for Lucy " . 
 Wabash is an easy @-@ going lad who " springs from the hill @-@ folk " His dubious banjo @-@ accompanied singing skills are a source of comedy relief . His family history is explicated in the Johnny Appleseed / Paul Bunyan @-@ style tale " The Legend of Alby <unk> . " 
 Angel is a long @-@ haired blond youth inspired by Billy the Kid . He is a skilled gunfighter , and possesses a fiery temper . Nicknamed ' the fire @-@ eatin ' , lead @-@ <unk> ' angel ' , when first meeting Clay Duncan , he presents himself thus : " Got not peeve ! I live alone ... and I want to be left alone ! I ain 't like other kids ! They got mothers and fathers to fuss over ' em ! Well , I don 't need nobody ! Nobody ! I kin handle myself against any man ! " His horse 's name is Paint . 
 Wee Willie Weehawken is the first arrival at Boys ' Ranch . Styled the " oldest boy at Boys ' Ranch " due to his advanced years , he cooks the meals at the ranch . " A very dangerous dude ! " , Boys ' Ranch # 1 reveals he had been a lawyer in his youth . 
 Happy Boy is a young Native American boy who appeared at the ranch one day . Never appearing on the cover , he does appear in one of the pin @-@ up illustrations . He begins to communicate using sign language in Boys ' Ranch # 6 and plays a more prominent role in the story " Happy Boy carries the ball " . 
 Palomino Sue hails from Abilene , Texas . Her father was a wagon master . She arrived at Boys ' Ranch after a trip on the wagon her father was driving was intercepted by Indians . She was the only survivor . When expressing a desire to get involved in fighting , Clay Duncan insists that , because it 's too dangerous for a woman , she must remain at the ranch . She agrees , but her acquiescence was a pretence , as she later joins the fray , offering opportune assistance . Similar scenes recur in her two subsequent appearances in issues # 5 and 6 . 
 Geronimo is portrayed as a fierce Apache military leader . As the son of Running Bear , he was a boyhood companion to Clay Duncan . Resentful of Duncan 's position in the tribe , they become bitter rivals " The Clay Duncan Story " . 
 Various Native American tribes appear as protagonists throughout . The conflict between Caucasians and American Indians is often the result of manipulation and exploitation by dishonest Caucasians . For example , in issue # 2 , Comanche and Blackfoot tribes are falsely told by white traffickers that their land will be seized so they can sell them rifles . In issue # 5 , the Apache Indians are blamed for robbing mail wagons , but in reality the perpetrators were white robbers using subterfuge to place blame on the Apaches . 
 The début issue opens with the chance meeting of Dandy and Wabash , who had been on opposite sides of the then recent Civil War , but became friends and decided to head out West together . Meanwhile , Clay Duncan meets up with Angel and the four come together in the defence of a ranch belonging to Jason Harper against an attack by Apache warriors . The story reveals Geronimo is the leader of that band when he joins the fray to order the band 's retreat . As his dying act , he bequeathed the ranch to the youngsters for use as a shelter for homeless boys . They are later joined by Wee Willie Weehawken , because he was a middle @-@ aged man , cited the technicality that the will didn 't specify the maximum age to qualify as a " boy " . Happy Boy joins the ranch shortly after . The ranch is near a town called Four Massacres .

 Boys ' Ranch has become one of Simon and Kirby 's most critically acclaimed creations and is held in high esteem by both creators . R. J. <unk> qualifies the series as having " much more depth than previous S & K kid @-@ gang strips – the basic elements that had made the romance and crime books so thematically strong were applied here as well . " <unk> points out a certain drop of quality in later issues : " It was part of the Simon and Kirby modus operandi to make heavy use of Kirby ’ s talents in the early issues of a new title and afterwards make more frequent use of other artists . For Boys ' Ranch the change seems much more dramatic then in other titles . The last three issues are good , but they are not the masterpieces that the earlier issues were . " 
 According to Richard Morrissey , Simon and Kirby 's final effort in the " kid gang " genre showed signs of evolving in new directions : " In Boys ' Ranch , Kirby seemed to be attempting to be going beyond his previous limitations ... More and more , the team was abandoning adolescent adventure for more adult concerns ... more than one observer has noted the similarities between the kid gangs of the ' 40s and early ' 50s with the adult teams of the late ' 50s and early ' 60s . " 
 = = = Mother Delilah = = = 
 The first story from issue # 3 , " Mother Delilah " , has been singled out as one of Simon and Kirby 's finest . Kirby has cited it as a personal favorite , and it has received accolades by critics , comic book professionals and fans alike . 
 A 20 @-@ page tale of betrayal , revenge , and redemption referencing the similarly themed biblical story of Samson and Delilah , the story features Clay Duncan , Angel , and Delilah Barker , a character influenced by Marlene Dietrich 's character from Destry Rides Again . A character named Virgil Underwood provides a Greek chorus @-@ like background commentary : " Those who find love are indeed fortunate , but woe <unk> them who demand it " ; the story 's final panel reads : 
 " And thus it ends . But ever to repeat 
 Again and again in reality and rhyme – 
 Love 's ever new as morning 's dew , 
 And hate is as old as time . " 
 Analyzing the story , R. C. Harvey concludes with : " From hate springs the desire for vengeance , and that desire , as Angel discovers , is debilitating . And even love can turn to hate unless love 's motive is a giving spirit . But a giving love is the ultimate redemption . " 
 = Wilhelm Steinitz = 
 Wilhelm ( later William ) Steinitz ( May 17 , 1836 – August 12 , 1900 ) was an Austrian and later American chess Master player , and the first undisputed world chess champion from 1886 to 1894 . He was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician . 
 When discussing chess history from the 1850s onwards , commentators have debated whether Steinitz could be effectively considered the champion from an earlier time , perhaps as early as 1866 . Steinitz lost his title to Emanuel Lasker in 1894 , and also lost a rematch in 1896 – 97 . 
 Statistical rating systems give Steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions , mainly because he took several long breaks from competitive play . However , an analysis based on one of these rating systems shows that he was one of the most dominant players in the history of the game . Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years , from 1862 to 1894 . 
 Although Steinitz became " world number one " by winning in the all @-@ out attacking style that was common in the 1860s , he unveiled in 1873 a new positional style of play , and demonstrated that it was superior to the previous style . His new style was controversial and some even branded it as " cowardly " , but many of Steinitz 's games showed that it could also set up attacks as ferocious as those of the old school . 
 Steinitz was also a prolific writer on chess , and defended his new ideas vigorously . The debate was so bitter and sometimes abusive that it became known as the " Ink War " . Steinitz was the target of anti @-@ Semitic abuse , and moved to the United States to escape this . By the early 1890s , Steinitz 's approach was widely accepted , and the next generation of top players acknowledged their debt to him , most notably his successor as world champion , Emanuel Lasker . 
 As a result of the " Ink War " , traditional accounts of Steinitz 's character depict him as ill @-@ tempered and aggressive ; but more recent research shows that he had long and friendly relationships with some players and chess organizations . Most notably from 1888 to 1889 he co @-@ operated with the American Chess Congress in a project to define rules governing the conduct of future world championships . Steinitz was unskilled at managing money , and lived in poverty all his life . 
 = = Early stages of chess career = = 
 Steinitz was born on May 17 , 1836 , in the Jewish ghetto of Prague ( now capital of the Czech Republic ; then in Bohemia , a part of the Austrian Empire ) . The last of a hardware retailer 's thirteen sons , he learned to play chess at age 12 . He began playing serious chess in his twenties , after leaving Prague in 1857 to study mathematics in Vienna , at the Vienna Polytechnic . Steinitz spent two years at the university . 
 He improved rapidly in chess during the late 1850s , progressing from third place in the 1859 Vienna City championship to first in 1861 , with a score of 30 / 31 . During this period he was nicknamed " the Austrian Morphy " . This achievement meant that he had become the strongest player in Austria . 
 = = International debut = = 
 Steinitz was then sent to represent Austria in the London 1862 chess tournament . He placed sixth , but his win over Augustus Mongredien was awarded the tournament 's brilliancy prize . He immediately challenged the fifth @-@ placed contestant , the strong veteran Italian Master <unk> Dubois , to a match , which Steinitz won ( five wins , one draw , three losses ) . This encouraged him to turn professional , and he took up residence in London . In 1862 – 63 Steinitz scored a crushing win in a match with Joseph Henry Blackburne , who went on to be one of the world 's top ten for 20 years , but who had only started playing chess two years earlier . Steinitz then beat some leading UK players in matches : Frederic Deacon and Augustus Mongredien in 1863 , and Valentine Green in 1864 . This charge up the rankings had a price : in March 1863 Steinitz apologized in a letter to Ignác Kolisch for not repaying a loan , because while Steinitz had been beating Blackburne , Daniel Harrwitz had " taken over " all of Steinitz 's clients at the London Chess Club , who had provided Steinitz 's main source of income . 
 = = Match against Anderssen = = 
 These successes established Steinitz as one of the world 's top players , and he was able to arrange a match in 1866 in London against Adolf Anderssen , who was regarded as the world 's strongest active player because he had won the 1851 and 1862 London International Tournaments and his one superior , Paul Morphy , had retired from competitive chess . Steinitz won with eight wins and six losses ( there were no draws ) , but it was a hard fight ; after 12 games the scores were level at 6 – 6 , then Steinitz won the last two games . 
 As a result of this match victory , Steinitz was generally regarded as the world 's best player . The prize money for this match was £ 100 to the winner ( Steinitz ) and £ 20 for the loser ( Anderssen ) . The winner 's prize was a large sum by the standards of the times , equivalent to about £ 57 @,@ 500 in 2007 's money . 
 = = Continued match play success = = 
 Steinitz won every serious match he played from 1862 until 1892 inclusive , sometimes by wide margins . 
 In the years following his victory over Anderssen , he beat Henry Bird in 1866 ( seven wins , five losses , five draws ) . He comfortably beat Johannes Zukertort in 1872 ( seven wins , four draws , one loss ; Zukertort had proved himself one of the elite by beating Anderssen by a large margin in 1871 ) . 
 = = Gradually improves tournament results = = 
 It took longer for Steinitz to reach the top in tournament play . In the next few years he took : third place at Paris 1867 behind Ignatz Kolisch and Simon Winawer ; and second place at Dundee ( 1867 ; Gustav Neumann won ) , and Baden @-@ Baden 1870 chess tournament ; behind Anderssen but ahead of Blackburne , Louis Paulsen and other strong players . His first victory in a strong tournament was London 1872 , ahead of Blackburne and Zukertort ; and the first tournament in which Steinitz finished ahead of Anderssen was Vienna 1873 , when Anderssen was 55 years old . 
 = = Changes style , introduces positional school = = 
 All of Steinitz 's successes up to 1872 inclusive were achieved in the attack @-@ at @-@ all @-@ costs " Romantic " style exemplified by Anderssen . But in the Vienna 1873 chess tournament , Steinitz unveiled a new " positional " style of play which was to become the basis of modern chess . He tied for first place with Blackburne , ahead of Anderssen , Samuel Rosenthal , Paulsen and Henry Bird , and won the play @-@ off against Blackburne . Steinitz made a shaky start , but won his last 14 games in the main tournament ( including 2 – 0 results over Paulsen , Anderssen , and Blackburne ) plus the two play @-@ off games – this was the start of a 25 @-@ game winning streak in serious competition . 
 = = Hiatus from competitive chess = = 
 Between 1873 and 1882 Steinitz played no tournaments and only one match ( a 7 – 0 win against Blackburne in 1876 ) . His other games during this period were in simultaneous and blindfold exhibitions , which contributed an important part of a professional chess @-@ player 's income in those days ( for example in 1887 Blackburne was paid 9 guineas for two simultaneous exhibitions and a blindfold exhibition hosted by the Teesside Chess Association ; this was equivalent to about £ 4 @,@ 800 at 2007 values ) . 
 = = Chess journalist = = 
 Instead , Steinitz concentrated on his work as a chess journalist , notably for The Field , which was Britain 's leading sports magazine . Some of Steinitz 's commentaries aroused heated debates , notably from Zukertort and Leopold Hoffer in The Chess Monthly ( which they founded in 1879 ) . This " Ink War " escalated sharply in 1881 , when Steinitz mercilessly criticized Hoffer 's annotations of games in the 1881 Berlin Congress ( won by Blackburne ahead of Zukertort ) . Steinitz was eager to settle the analytical debates by a second match against Zukertort , whose unwillingness to play provoked scornful comments from Steinitz . In mid @-@ 1882 James Mason , a consistently strong player , challenged Steinitz to a match , and accused Steinitz of cowardice when Steinitz insisted the issue with Zukertort should be settled first . Steinitz responded by inviting Mason to name a sufficiently high stake for a match , at least £ 150 per player ( equivalent to about £ 73 @,@ 000 in 2007 's money ) , but Mason was unwilling to stake more than £ 100 . Mason later agreed to play a match with Zukertort for a stake of £ 100 per player , but soon " postponed " that match , " circumstances having arisen that make it highly inconvenient for me to proceed ...

 Steinitz returned to serious competitive chess in the Vienna 1882 chess tournament , which has been described as the strongest chess tournament of all time at that point . Despite a shaky start he took equal first place with Szymon Winawer , ahead of James Mason , Zukertort , George Henry Mackenzie , Blackburne , Berthold <unk> , Paulsen and Mikhail Chigorin , and drew the play @-@ off match . 
 = = = Victim of anti @-@ Semitic attacks = = = 
 In 1882 , while Steinitz was playing in Vienna and sending weekly reports on the tournament to The Field , there was a plot against him back in England . Just after the end of the tournament The Field published an anti @-@ Semitic article by Hoffer that praised the efforts of the English players and those of English origin in Vienna , but disparaged the victory of Steinitz and Winawer , both Jews . Steinitz stopped working for The Field and was replaced by Hoffer , a close friend of Zukertort and a bitter enemy of Steinitz . Sources differ about exactly when the Hoffer @-@ Zukertort faction took over the chess columns at The Field ; some say it was after the 1883 London tournament , so there was a gap between Steinitz 's tenure and Hoffer 's . 
 = = = Visits USA = = = 
 Steinitz visited the USA , mainly the Philadelphia area , from December 1882 to May 1883 . He was given an enthusiastic reception . Steinitz played several exhibitions , many casual games , and a match for stakes of £ 50 with a wealthy amateur . He also won three more serious matches with two New World professionals , Alexander <unk> ( Steinitz won both ) and the Cuban champion Celso Golmayo <unk> . The match with Golmayo was abandoned when Steinitz was leading ( eight wins , one draw , one loss ) . His hosts even arranged a visit to New Orleans , where Paul Morphy lived .

 Later in 1883 , Steinitz took second place in the extremely strong London 1883 chess tournament behind Zukertort , who made a brilliant start , faded at the end but finished 3 points ahead . Steinitz finished 2 ½ points ahead of the third @-@ placed competitor , Blackburne . Zukertort 's victory again led some commentators to suggest that Zukertort should be regarded as the world chess champion , while others said the issue could only be resolved by a match between Steinitz and Zukertort . 
 = = Settles in USA = = 
 In 1883 , shortly after the London tournament , Steinitz decided to leave England and moved to New York , where he lived for the rest of his life . This did not end the " Ink War " : his enemies persuaded some of the American press to publish anti @-@ Steinitz articles , and in 1885 Steinitz founded the International Chess Magazine , which he edited until 1895 . In his magazine he chronicled the lengthy negotiations for a match with Zukertort . He also managed to find supporters in other sections of the American press including Turf , Field and Farm and the St. Louis Globe @-@ Democrat , both of which reported Steinitz 's offer to forgo all fees , expenses or share in the stake and make the match " a benefit performance , solely for Mr Zukertort 's pecuniary profit " . 
 = = World Championship match = = 
 Eventually it was agreed that in 1886 Steinitz and Zukertort would play a match in New York , St. Louis and New Orleans , and that the victor would be the player who first won 10 games . At Steinitz 's insistence the contract said it would be " for the Championship of the World " . After the five games played in New York , Zukertort led by 4 – 1 , but in the end Steinitz won decisively by 12 ½ – 7 ½ ( ten wins , five draws , five losses ) . The collapse by Zukertort , who won only one of the last 15 games , has been described as " perhaps the most thoroughgoing reversal of fortune in the history of world championship play . " 
 Though not yet officially an American citizen , Steinitz wanted the United States flag to be placed next to him during the match . He became a U.S. citizen on November 23 , 1888 , having resided for five years in New York , and changed his first name from Wilhelm to William . 
 In 1887 the American Chess Congress started work on drawing up regulations for the future conduct of world championship contests . Steinitz actively supported this endeavor , as he thought he was becoming too old to remain world champion – he wrote in his own magazine " I know I am not fit to be the champion , and I am not likely to bear that title for ever " . 
 = = Defeats Chigorin = = 
 In 1888 the Havana Chess Club offered to sponsor a match between Steinitz and whomever he would select as a worthy opponent . Steinitz nominated the Russian Mikhail Chigorin , on the condition that the invitation should not be presented as a challenge from him . There is some doubt about whether this was intended to be a match for the world championship : both Steinitz 's letters and the publicity material just before the match conspicuously avoided the phrase . The proposed match was to have a maximum of 20 games , and Steinitz had said that fixed @-@ length matches were unsuitable for world championship contests because the first player to take the lead could then play for draws ; and Steinitz was at the same time supporting the American Chess Congress ' world championship project . Whatever the status of the match , it was played in Havana in January to February 1889 , and won by Steinitz ( ten wins , one draw , six losses ) . 
 = = = New York 1889 tournament = = = 
 The American Chess Congress ' final proposal was that the winner of a tournament to be held in New York in 1889 should be regarded as world champion for the time being , but must be prepared to face a challenge from the second or third placed competitor within a month . Steinitz wrote that he would not play in the tournament and would not challenge the winner unless the second and third placed competitors failed to do so . The tournament was duly played , but the outcome was not quite as planned : Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place ; their play @-@ off resulted in four draws , and Weiss then wanted to get back to his work for the Rothschild Bank , conceding the title to Chigorin . 
 However , the third prize @-@ winner Isidore Gunsberg was prepared to play Chigorin for the title . The match was played in Havana in 1890 and ended in a 9 @-@ 9 tie ; this match is not considered as a World Championship encounter . The American Chess Congress 's experiment was not repeated , and Steinitz 's last three matches were private arrangements between the players . 
 = = Wins rematch against Chigorin = = 
 In 1891 the Saint Petersburg Chess Society and the Havana Chess Club offered to organize another Steinitz – Chigorin match for the world championship . Steinitz played against Chigorin in Havana in 1892 , and won narrowly ( ten wins , five draws , eight losses ) . 
 German Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch turned down an opportunity in 1892 to challenge Steinitz in a world championship match , because of the demands of his medical practice . 
 = = Loses title to Lasker = = 
 Around this time Steinitz publicly spoke of retiring , but changed his mind when Emanuel Lasker , 32 years younger and comparatively untested at the top level , challenged him . Lasker had been earlier that year refused a non @-@ title challenge by fellow German , Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch , who was at the time the world 's most dominant tournament player . 
 Initially , Lasker wanted to play for $ 5 @,@ 000 a side , and a match was agreed at stakes of $ 3 @,@ 000 a side , but Steinitz agreed to a series of reductions when Lasker found it difficult to raise the money , and the final figure was $ 2 @,@ 000 each , which was less than for some of Steinitz 's earlier matches ( the final combined stake of $ 4 @,@ 000 would be worth about $ 495 @,@ 500 at 2007 values ) . Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz 's part , Steinitz may have desperately needed the money . 
 The match was played in 1894 , at venues in New York , Philadelphia and Montreal . The 32 @-@ year age difference between the combatants was the largest in the history of world championship play , and remains so today . Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt , so it came as a shock when Lasker won the first game . Steinitz responded by winning the second , and was able to maintain the balance until the sixth . However , Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the 11th , and Steinitz asked for a one @-@ week rest . When the match resumed , Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games . Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th , and Steinitz was unable to compensate for his losses in the middle of the match . Hence Lasker won with ten wins , five losses and four draws . Some commentators thought Steinitz 's habit of playing " experimental " moves in serious competition was a major factor in his downfall . 
 = = = Increased tournament activity = = = 
 After losing the title , Steinitz played in tournaments more frequently than he had previously . He won at New York 1894 , and was fifth at Hastings 1895 ( winning the first brilliancy prize for his game with Curt von Bardeleben ) . At Saint Petersburg 1895 , a super @-@ strong four player , multi @-@ round @-@ robin event , with Lasker , Chigorin and Pillsbury , he took second place . Later his results began to decline : 6th in Nuremberg 1896 , 5th in Cologne 1898 , 10th in London 1899 . 
 In early 1896 , Steinitz defeated the Russian Emanuel <unk> in a match ( winning 6 games , drawing 1 , losing 4 ) . 
 = = = Outclassed in rematch with Lasker = = = 
 In November , 1896 to January , 1897 Steinitz played a return match with Lasker in Moscow , but won only 2 games , drawing 5 , and losing 10 . This was the last world chess championship match for eleven years . Shortly after the match , Steinitz had a mental breakdown and was confined for 40 days in a Moscow sanatorium , where he played chess with the inmates . 
 = = Questions : The beginning of Steinitz 's reign = = 
 There is a long @-@ running debate among chess writers about whether Steinitz 's reign as World Chess Champion began in 1866 , when he beat Anderssen , or in 1886 , when he beat Zukertort . Based on In April 1894 the British Chess Magazine described Steinitz as holding " the chess championship of the world for 28 years " . However , there is no evidence that he claimed the title for himself in 1866 , although in the 1880s he claimed to have been the champion since his win over Anderssen . It has been suggested that Steinitz could not make such a claim while Paul Morphy was alive . Morphy had defeated Anderssen by a far wider margin , 8 – 3 , in 1858 , but retired from chess competition soon after he returned to the USA in 1859 , and died in 1884 . The 1886 Steinitz vs. Zukertort match was the first that was explicitly described as being for the World Championship , but Howard Staunton and Paul Morphy had been unofficially described as " World Chess Champion " around the middle of the 19th century . In fact one of the organizers of the 1851 London International tournament had said the contest was for " the baton of the World 's Chess Champion " , and in mid @-@ 1840s Ludwig Bledow wrote a letter to Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa suggesting they should organize a world championship tournament in Germany . Some commentators described Steinitz as " the champion " in the years following his 1872 match victory against Zukertort . In the late 1870s and early 1880s some regarded Steinitz as the champion and others supported Johannes Zukertort , and the 1886 match was not regarded as creating the title of World Champion , but as resolving conflicting claims to the title . On the other hand George Alcock MacDonnell hailed Joseph Blackburne as " World Champion " for his win in the 1881 Berlin Tournament , George Henry Mackenzie as having " won the Chess Championship of the World " in 1887 , and Isidore Gunsberg as " among the champions of the world " following his win at " Bradford Place " in 1888 . However , Steinitz regarded G.A. MacDonnell as " one of my bitterest and most untruthful persecutors " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Steinitz lived with a lady named Caroline Golder ( born 1846 ) in the 1860s , and their only daughter Flora was born in 1866 . Flora died in 1888 at the age of 21 , and Caroline died in 1892 . He married his second wife a few years later , and had two children by her . In 1897 he dedicated a pamphlet to the memory of his first wife and their daughter . 
 In February 1897 , the New York Times prematurely reported his death in a New York mental asylum . Some authors claim that he contracted syphilis , which may have been a cause of the mental breakdowns he suffered in his last years . In the months prior to his death , he spent some time in institutions as a result of his failing mental health . His chess activities had not yielded any great financial rewards , and he died a pauper in the Manhattan State Hospital ( Ward Island ) of a heart attack on August 12 , 1900 . Steinitz is buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn , New York . His second wife and their two young children were still alive at his death . 
 = = Writings = = 
 Steinitz was the main chess correspondent of the The Field ( in London ) from 1873 to 1882 , and used this to present his ideas about chess strategy . In 1885 he founded the International Chess Magazine in New York and edited it until 1891 . In addition to game commentaries and blow @-@ by @-@ blow accounts of the negotiations leading to his 1886 match with Johann Zukertort and of the American Chess Congress ' world championship project , he wrote a long series of articles about Paul Morphy , who had died in 1884 . He wrote the book of the 1889 New York tournament , in which he commented on all of the games 432 of them , and in 1889 he published a textbook , The Modern Chess Instructor . 
 Steinitz also allegedly wrote a pamphlet entitled Capital , Labor , and Charity while confined at River Crest Sanitarium in New York during the final months of his life . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 The book of the Hastings 1895 chess tournament , written collectively by the players , described Steinitz as follows : 
 Mr. Steinitz stands high as a theoretician and as a writer ; he has a powerful pen , and when he chooses can use expressive English . He evidently strives to be fair to friends and foes alike , but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much like many others in this respect . Possessed of a fine intellect , and extremely fond of the game , he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations , people and business alike . Chess is his very life and soul , the one thing for which he lives . 
 = = = Influence on the game = = = 
 Steinitz 's play up to and including 1872 was similar to that of his contemporaries : sharp , aggressive , and full of sacrificial play . This was the style in which he became " world number one " by beating Adolf Anderssen in 1866 and confirmed his position by beating Zukertort in 1872 and winning the 1872 London International tournament ( Zukertort had claimed the rank of number two by beating Anderssen in 1871 ) . 
 In 1873 , however , Steinitz 's play suddenly changed , giving priority to what is now called the positional elements in chess : pawn structure , space , outposts for knights , the advantage of the two bishops , etc . Although Steinitz often accepted unnecessarily difficult defensive positions in order to demonstrate the superiority of his theories , he also showed that his methods could provide a platform for crushing attacks . Steinitz 's successor as world champion , Emanuel Lasker , summed up the new style as : " In the beginning of the game ignore the search for combinations , abstain from violent moves , aim for small advantages , accumulate them , and only after having attained these ends search for the combination – and then with all the power of will and intellect , because then the combination must exist , however deeply hidden . " 
 Although Steinitz 's play changed abruptly , he said had been thinking along such lines for some years : 
 Some of the games which I saw Paulsen play during the London Congress of 1862 gave a still stronger start to the modification of my own opinions , which has since developed , and I began to recognize that Chess genius is not confined to the more or less deep and brilliant finishing strokes after the original balance of power and position has been overthrown , but that it also requires the exercise of still more extraordinary powers , though perhaps of a different kind to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at the proper time in one 's own favor . 
 During his nine @-@ year layoff from tournament play ( 1873 – 82 ) and later in his career , Steinitz used his chess writings to present his theories – while in the UK he wrote for The Field ; in 1885 after moving to New York he founded the " International Chess Magazine " , of which he was the chief editor ; and in 1889 he edited the book of the great New York 1889 tournament ( won by Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss ) , in which he did not compete as the tournament was designed to produce his successor as World Champion . Many other writers found his new approach incomprehensible , boring or even cowardly ; for example Adolf Anderssen said , " Kolisch is a highwayman and points the pistol at your breast . Steinitz is a pick @-@ pocket , he steals a pawn and wins a game with it . " 
 But when he contested the first World Championship match in 1886 against Johannes Zukertort , it became evident that Steinitz was playing on another level . Although Zukertort was at least Steinitz 's equal in spectacular attacking play , Steinitz often outmaneuvered him fairly simply by the use of positional principles . 
 By the time of his match in 1890 – 91 against Gunsberg , some commentators showed an understanding of and appreciation for Steinitz 's theories . Shortly before the 1894 match with Emanuel Lasker , even the New York Times , which had earlier published attacks on his play and character , paid tribute to his playing record , the importance of his theories , and his sportsmanship in agreeing to the most difficult match of his career despite his previous intention of retiring . 
 By the end of his career , Steinitz was more highly esteemed as a theoretician than as a player . The comments about him in the book of the Hastings 1895 chess tournament focus on his theories and writings , and Emanuel Lasker was more explicit : " He was a thinker worthy of a seat in the halls of a University . A player , as the world believed he was , he was not ; his studious temperament made that impossible ; and thus he was conquered by a player ... " 
 As a result of his play and writings Steinitz , along with Paul Morphy , is considered by many chess commentators to be the founder of modern chess . Lasker , who took the championship from Steinitz , wrote , " I who vanquished him must see to it that his great achievement , his theories should find justice , and I must avenge the wrongs he suffered . " Vladimir Kramnik emphasizes Steinitz 's importance as a pioneer in the field of chess theory : " Steinitz was the first to realise that chess , despite being a complicated game , obeys some common principles . ... But as often happens the first time is just a try . ... I can 't say he was the founder of a chess theory . He was an experimenter and pointed out that chess obeys laws that should be considered . "

 Statistical rating systems are unkind to Steinitz . " Warriors of the Mind " gives him a ranking of 47th , below several obscure Soviet grandmasters ; Chessmetrics places him only 15th on its all @-@ time list . Chessmetrics penalizes players who play infrequently ; opportunities for competitive chess were infrequent in Steinitz 's best years , and Steinitz had a few long absences from competitive play ( 1873 – 76 , 1876 – 82 , 1883 – 86 , 1886 – 89 ) . However , in 2005 Chessmetrics ' author , Jeff Sonas , wrote an article which examined various ways of comparing the strength of " world number one " players , using data provided by Chessmetrics , and found that : Steinitz was further ahead of his contemporaries in the 1870s than Bobby Fischer was in his peak period ( 1970 – 72 ) ; that Steinitz had the third @-@ highest total number of years as the world 's top player , behind Emanuel Lasker and Garry Kasparov ; and that Steinitz placed 7th in a comparison of how long players were ranked in the world 's top three . Between his victory over Anderssen ( 1866 ) and his loss to Emanuel Lasker ( 1894 ) , Steinitz won all his " normal " matches , sometimes by wide margins ; and his worst tournament performance in that 28 @-@ year period was third place in Paris ( 1867 ) . { } ( He also lost two handicap matches and a match by telegraph in 1890 against Mikhail Chigorin , where Chigorin was allowed to choose the openings in both games and won both . ) 
 Initially Steinitz played in the all @-@ out attacking style of contemporaries like Anderssen , and then changed to the positional style with which he dominated competitive chess in the 1870s and 1880s . Max Euwe wrote , " Steinitz aimed at positions with clear @-@ cut features , to which his theory was best applicable . " However , he retained his capacity for brilliant attacks right to the end of his career ; for example in the 1895 Hastings tournament ( when he was 59 ) he beat von Bardeleben in a spectacular game in which in the closing stages Steinitz deliberately exposed all his pieces to attack simultaneously ( except his king , of course ) . His most significant weaknesses were his habits of playing " experimental " moves and getting into unnecessarily difficult defensive positions in top @-@ class competitive games . 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 " Traditional " accounts of Steinitz describe him as having a sharp tongue and violent temper , perhaps partly because of his short stature ( barely five feet ) and congenital lameness . He admitted that " Like the Duke of Parma , I always hold the sword in one hand and the olive branch in the other " , and under severe provocation he could become abusive in published articles . He was aware of his own tendencies and said early in his career , " Nothing would induce me to take charge of a chess column ... Because I should be so fair in dispensing blame as well as praise that I should be sure to give offence and make enemies . " When he embarked on chess journalism , his brutally frank review of Wormald 's The Chess Openings in 1875 proved him right on both counts .
