 Green Lantern received negative reviews from critics . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has a rating of 26 % , based on 226 reviews , with an average rating of 4 @.@ 6 / 10 .

On Metacritic , the film has a score of 39 out of 100 , based on 39 critics , indicating " Generally unfavorable reviews " . 
 Justin Chang of Variety gave Green Lantern a Great review , stating , " Martin Campbell 's visually lavish sci @-@ fi adventure is a highly unstable alloy of the serious , the goofy and the downright derivative . " Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said , " Green Lantern is bad . This despite Ryan Reynolds 's dazzling dentistry , hard @-@ body physique and earnest efforts , and the support of fine performers like Peter Sarsgaard ... Mark Strong ... and Angela Bassett " . Christy Lemire of the Associated Press called it a " joyless amalgamation of expository dialogue and special effects that aren 't especially special .

 Conversely , Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave it a positive review , saying the film " serves up all the requisite elements with enough self @-@ deprecating humor to suggest it doesn 't take itself too seriously " . Reviewer Leonard Maltin felt that " the film offers a dazzling array of visual effects , a likable hero , a beautiful leading lady , a colorful villain , and a good backstory .

" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said , " More science @-@ fiction space opera than superhero epic , it works in fits and starts as its disparate parts go in and out of effectiveness , but the professionalism of the production make it watchable in a comic book kind of way " . 
 While promoting Deadpool ( in which Reynolds portrays another famous comic book superhero ) , Reynolds said that filming Green Lantern itself was frustrating , " You really need a visionary behind a movie like that , but it was the classic studio story : " We have a poster , but we don 't have a script or know what we want ; let 's start shooting !

 In 2010 , director Martin Campbell confirmed the possibility of a Green Lantern trilogy . Warner Bros originally planned on Green Lantern being the first entry of a new DC franchise , and commissioned a script for a sequel from Greg Berlanti , Michael Green , and Marc Guggenheim during filming . In August 2010 , they retained Michael Goldenberg to write the screenplay , based on the sequel treatment . The scene in the film 's end credits implying a resurgence of the yellow power ring of " fear " including Sinestro becoming corrupted by its energy strongly suggested a planned sequel . In September 2011 , Warner Bros. , dismayed by the film 's negative reviews and disappointing box office return , abandoned plans for sequels . 
 In June 2013 , David S. Goyer confirmed that Man of Steel is the first film of the DC Extended Universe by stating that " from Man of Steel onward , possible films could expand into a shared universe " , confirming that should the Green Lantern property be featured in an upcoming DC film , it will be a rebooted version . Goyer also said to have interest in taking the new version of the character to film . Warner Bros announced plans on releasing a solo Green Lantern film titled Green Lantern Corps on June 19 , 2020 , as the eleventh installment of the DC Extended Universe . Hal Jordan and John Stewart will reportedly be the featured Green Lanterns in the film . 
 = Satsuma @-@ class battleship = 
 The Satsuma class ( <unk> , Satsuma @-@ gata senkan ) was a pair of semi @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) in the first decade of the 20th century . They were the first battleships to be built in Japan and marked a transitional stage between the pre @-@ dreadnought and true dreadnought designs . They saw no combat during World War I , although Satsuma led a squadron that occupied several German colonies in the Pacific Ocean in 1914 . Both ships were disarmed and expended as targets in 1922 – 24 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Satsuma class was ordered in late 1904 under the 1904 War Naval Supplementary Program during the Russo @-@ Japanese War . Unlike the previous Katori @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships , they were the first battleships ordered from Japanese shipyards , although the first ship in the class , Satsuma , used many imported components . 
 They were originally intended to mount a dozen 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) gun in four twin and four single @-@ gun turrets , but the combination of a shortage of Japanese @-@ built 12 @-@ inch guns and their additional expense caused the ships to be redesigned to carry four 12 @-@ inch and twelve 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) guns , all in twin @-@ gun turrets . The intended armament of these ships , laid down before HMS Dreadnought , would have made them the first " all big @-@ gun " battleships in the world had they been completed to their original design . 
 Probably reflecting extensive British technical assistance , the Satsuma @-@ class ships greatly resembled an enlarged version of the British Lord Nelson class with the single @-@ gun amidships intermediate turrets replaced by twin @-@ gun turrets . With their heavy intermediate armament , the ships were considered to be semi @-@ dreadnoughts , a transitional stage between pre @-@ dreadnoughts with their light intermediate armament and dreadnoughts solely equipped with large guns . 
 = = Description = = 
 The construction of Aki was delayed since she could not be laid down until the slipway occupied by the armored cruiser Tsukuba was freed by that ship 's launching . The IJN took the opportunity provided by the delay to modify the ship to accommodate steam turbines and various other changes that generally increased her size . The changes were great enough that Aki is generally considered a half sister to Satsuma . The crew ranged from 800 to 940 officers and enlisted men . 
 Satsuma had an overall length of 482 feet ( 146 @.@ 9 m ) , a beam of 83 @.@ 5 feet ( 25 @.@ 5 m ) , and a normal draft of 27 @.@ 5 feet ( 8 @.@ 4 m ) . She displaced 19 @,@ 372 long tons ( 19 @,@ 683 t ) at normal load . 
 Aki was 492 feet ( 150 @.@ 0 m ) long overall , had a beam of 83 @.@ 6 feet ( 25 @.@ 5 m ) , and the same draft as her half @-@ sister . She displaced 20 @,@ 100 long tons ( 20 @,@ 400 t ) at normal load . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Satsuma was powered by a pair of vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam generated by 20 Miyabara water @-@ tube boilers using a mixture of coal and fuel oil . The engines were rated at a total of 17 @,@ 300 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 900 kW ) and designed to reach a top speed of 18 @.@ 25 knots ( 33 @.@ 80 km / h ; 21 @.@ 00 mph ) . During the ship 's sea trials she reached 18 @.@ 95 knots ( 35 @.@ 10 km / h ; 21 @.@ 81 mph ) from 18 @,@ 507 ihp ( 13 @,@ 801 kW ) . Satsuma carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 860 long tons ( 2 @,@ 910 t ) of coal and 377 long tons ( 383 t ) of oil which allowed her to steam for 9 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 16 @,@ 900 km ; 10 @,@ 500 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Unlike her half @-@ sister , she only had two funnels . 
 Aki was intended use the same type of engines as her sister , but the IJN decided fit her with a pair of Curtiss steam turbine sets after she was launched in 1907 . The turbines each powered one propeller shaft using steam from 15 Miyabara boilers . The turbines were rated at a total of 24 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 18 @,@ 000 kW ) for a design speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . The ship reached a top speed of 20 @.@ 25 knots ( 37 @.@ 50 km / h ; 23 @.@ 30 mph ) during her sea trials from 27 @,@ 740 shp ( 20 @,@ 690 kW ) . She carried a maximum of 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) of coal and 172 long tons ( 175 t ) of oil gave her the same range as her half sister . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships were completed with four 45 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ inch 41st Year Type guns in two gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . They fired 850 @-@ pound ( 386 kg ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 800 ft / s ( 850 m / s ) ; this gave a maximum range of 24 @,@ 000 yards ( 22 @,@ 000 m ) . The intermediate armament was much more numerous than in the preceding Katori class , with six twin @-@ gun turrets equipped with 45 @-@ caliber Type 41 10 @-@ inch guns , three turrets on each side of the superstructure . The guns had a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 707 ft / s ( 825 m / s ) when firing 500 @-@ pound ( 227 kg ) shells . 
 The other major difference between the two ships was that Aki 's secondary armament consisted of eight 45 @-@ caliber 6 @-@ inch 41st Year Type guns , mounted in casemates in the sides of the hull . The gun fired a 100 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) AP shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 706 ft / s ( 825 m / s ) . Satsuma , in contrast , was equipped with a dozen 40 @-@ caliber 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch 41st Year Type quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , mounted in casemates in the sides of the hull . The gun fired a 45 @-@ pound ( 20 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 150 ft / s ( 660 m / s ) . 
 The ships were also equipped with four ( Satsuma ) or eight ( Aki ) 40 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ pounder 12 @-@ cwt QF guns and four 28 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ pounder QF guns . Both of these guns fired 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 67 kg ) shells with muzzle velocities of 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ( 700 m / s ) and 1 @,@ 500 feet per second ( 450 m / s ) respectively . In addition , the battleships were fitted with five submerged 18 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) torpedo tubes , two on each broadside and one in the stern . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The waterline main belt of the Satsuma @-@ class vessels consisted of Krupp cemented armor that had a maximum thickness of 9 inches ( 229 mm ) amidships and tapered to a thickness of 4 inches ( 102 mm ) inches at the ends of the ship . A 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) strake of armor protected the casemates . The barbettes for the main guns were 7 – 9 @.@ 5 inches ( 180 – 240 mm ) thick . The armor of Satsuma 's main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 8 inches ( 203 mm ) inches and those of Aki were an inch thicker . The deck armor was 2 – 3 inches ( 51 – 76 mm ) thick and the conning tower was protected by six inches of armor .

 = = Service = = 
 The completion of the British battleship Dreadnought with her all big @-@ gun @-@ armament and steam turbines in 1906 meant that these ships were obsolete even before they were completed . The IJN recognized that fact when it drew up the first iteration of its Eight @-@ Eight Fleet building plan for eight first @-@ class battleships and eight battlecruisers in 1910 and did not include them . 
 Aki was refitting at Kure and Satsuma was assigned to the 1st Battleship Squadron when World War I began in August 1914 . The latter served as Rear Admiral Tatsuo Matsumura 's flagship in the Second South Seas Squadron as it seized the German possessions of the Caroline and the Palau Islands in October 1914 . Satsuma rejoined the 1st Battleship Squadron in 1915 , was refitted at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in 1916 and served with the 1st Squadron for the rest of the war . Aki was also assigned to the 1st Squadron upon the completion of her refit and remained with it until she was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Squadron in 1918 . 
 In the years immediately following the end of the war , the United States , Britain , and Japan all launched huge naval construction programs . All three countries decided that a new naval arms race would be ill @-@ advised , and so convened the Washington Naval Conference to discuss arms limitations , which produced the Washington Naval Treaty , signed in February 1922 . Japan was well over the tonnage limits and all of her obsolete predreadnought and semi @-@ dreadnought battleships had to be disposed of by the end of 1924 . Both ships were disarmed at Yokosuka in 1922 , stricken from the Navy List during 1923 and converted into target ships . Aki was sunk by the battlecruiser Kongō and the battleship Hyūga in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1924 ; Satsuma was sunk by the battleships Nagato and Mutsu five days later in the same area . 
 = Great Eastern Highway = 
 Great Eastern Highway is a 590 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 370 mi ) road that links the Western Australian capital of Perth with the city of Kalgoorlie . A key route for road vehicles accessing the eastern Wheatbelt and the Goldfields , it is the western portion of the main road link between Perth and the eastern states of Australia . The highway forms the majority of National Highway 94 , although the alignment through the Perth suburbs of Guildford and Midland , and the eastern section between Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie are not included . Various segments form parts of other road routes , including National Route 1 , Alternate National Route 94 , and State Route 51 . 
 There are numerous intersections in Perth with other highways and main roads , including Canning , Albany , Tonkin and Roe Highways , and Graham Farmer Freeway . There are also two rural highways that spur off Great Eastern Highway . Great Southern Highway begins near Perth 's eastern metropolitan boundary , linking towns such as York , Brookton , Narrogin , and Katanning . Near the eastern end of the highway , Coolgardie is the starting point of Coolgardie – Esperance Highway , connecting to the interstate route Eyre Highway at Norseman , as well as the coastal town of Esperance . 
 The highway was created in the 1930s from an existing system of roads linking Perth with the Goldfields . Though the name Great Eastern Highway was coined to describe the route from Perth to Guildford on the northern side of the Swan River ( modern @-@ day Guildford Road ) , it was actually used for the road through Belmont , south of the river . This section was constructed in 1867 using convict labour , with the road base made from sections of tree trunks . Over the years the road has been upgraded , with the whole highway sealed by 1953 , segments reconstructed and widened , dual carriageways created in Perth and Kalgoorlie , and grade separated interchanges built at major intersections . Great Eastern Highway Bypass in Perth 's eastern suburbs opened in 1988 , allowing through traffic to avoid the Guildford and Midland townsites , and in 2002 a new bypass diverted the highway around Northam . A future route to replace Great Eastern Highway 's current ascent of the Darling Scarp has been identified . The planned route is a controlled @-@ access highway along Toodyay Road to <unk> , and then across to Wundowie via a new alignment . Though planning began in the 1970s , as of 2012 , construction of this route has not been scheduled , and it is not considered a priority . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Great Eastern Highway commences at The Causeway , a river crossing that connects to Perth 's central business district . Travelling north @-@ east through the city to Greenmount Hill , and following a steep climb , the highway heads east through Western Australia 's Wheatbelt to Kalgoorlie , in the state 's Goldfields . Within Perth , the highway is a six @-@ lane dual carriageway from The Causeway to Tonkin Highway near Perth Airport . It travels as a four lane single carriageway to Midland , with the second carriageway reappearing after Roe Highway , and continuing all the way to The Lakes at Perth 's eastern fringe . The remainder of the highway is a two @-@ lane single carriageway until Kalgoorlie , where a dual carriageway exists . The speed limit is 60 kilometres per hour ( 35 mph ) from The Causeway to Midland , 70 km / h ( 45 mph ) near the bottom of Greenmount Hill , and 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) from Greenmount to Sawyers Valley . From the eastern edge of Perth it is generally 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) , but with lower limits for sections near the towns the highway encounters en route to Kalgoorlie . 
 The highway runs mostly parallel to the Mundaring to Kalgoorlie water pipeline , which supplies the Goldfields with water from Mundaring Weir in the eastern part of Perth . The Golden Pipeline Heritage Trail is a tourist drive alongside the pipeline , with large sections of the trail following Great Eastern Highway . Various road routes are allocated to sections of Great Eastern Highway , with some overlap between some of the routes . It is mostly signed as National Highway 94 , except for the section between Great Eastern Highway Bypass and Roe Highway , and the final 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) from Coolgardie to Kalgoorlie . It is also signed as National Route 1 between The Causeway and Morrison Road in Midland , State Route 51 between Johnson Street in Guildford and Roe Highway , Tourist Drive 203 between Terrace Road in Guildford and Morrison Road , Midland , and Alternate National Route 94 east of Coolgardie . 
 Main Roads Western Australia monitors traffic volume across the state 's road network , including various locations along Great Eastern Highway . In 2008 / 09 , the busiest section was east of the Graham Farmer Freeway interchange , averaging 60 @,@ 760 vehicles per weekday . The lowest volume was an average of 850 vehicles per day near Ryans Find Road , partway between Southern Cross and Coolgardie ; however , this point also received the largest proportion of heavy vehicles , at 40 @.@ 2 % of all traffic . As of 2012 , Great Eastern Highway between Mundaring and Northam is the state 's worst section of National Highway , in terms of road safety . Casualty crash rates had decreased since 2007 , although the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia ( RAC ) still considered it a risky section of road needing close attention from road authorities . In 2013 , Great Eastern Highway remained as a road of particular concern , with the Australian Automobile Association giving 67 % of the highway a low one- or two @-@ star rating ( out of five ) , and 77 % of the route between The Lakes and Northam a one @-@ star safety rating .

After 4 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 9 mi ) , Great Eastern Highway interchanges with Tonkin Highway , which connects to Perth 's north @-@ eastern and south @-@ eastern suburbs , and Brearley Avenue , which provides access to Perth Airport 's domestic terminals . 
 The road travels for another 2 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 3 mi ) along the border between Ascot and Redcliffe , before reaching a traffic light controlled fork with Great Eastern Highway Bypass . The main traffic flow continues east on the bypass to Roe Highway , while the Great Eastern Highway runs north @-@ east through South Guildford for 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , separating a narrow residential area along the Swan River from industrial development in the rest of the suburb . The highway crosses the Helena River via a two @-@ lane bridge , and continues north into the historic townsite of Guildford , named as Johnson Street . After 800 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) , Johnson Street terminates at a T junction , just south of the Midland railway line . The highway turns east onto James Street , which after 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) has a sharp 90 degree turn to the north , continuing as East Street for 450 metres ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) . Following a level crossing of the railway , and an adjacent set of traffic lights at Terrace Road , the name Great Eastern Highway is resumed . 
 The highway continues north @-@ east for 1 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 1 mi ) to Midland . Throughout Midland and the adjacent suburb of Midvale , it is at the centre of a commercial area , with two shopping centres located alongside the highway , and retail businesses fronting both sides of the road . As Great Eastern Highway enters Midland , traffic splits into a pair of one @-@ way roads . Eastbound traffic continues on Great Eastern Highway , while westbound traffic travels along Victoria Street . The split ends after 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) , and a further 1 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 1 mi ) takes the highway to an interchange with Roe Highway , meeting up with traffic that bypassed the Guildford and Midland areas . 
 = = = Greenmount to The Lakes = = = 
 Great Eastern Highway is notorious for Greenmount Hill , where the highway encounters a steep three @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) slope with a 7 % gradient on Perth 's eastern outskirts . The highway rises from the Swan Coastal Plain to the Darling Scarp to the north of Greenmount Hill , though it is commonly described as travelling " up Greenmount " . The historic hill , with significant Aboriginal and European heritage sites , has been a well @-@ known landmark since the 1830s , and featured on an 1846 survey of the York Road . Part of this original eastern route remains as a separate road , now known as Old York Road . The highway diverges from this original route at a point 2 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 7 mi ) east of Roe Highway , bypassing residential properties that line the old road . The two routes meet again at the top of the main climb of the hill , after 1 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 1 mi ) . 
 From the sudden rise of Greenmount Hill through to Sawyers Valley , Great Eastern Highway has a series of rising and falling sections over rolling terrain . Along the way , the route follows the southern edge of John Forrest National Park for 3 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 1 mi ) , passing to the north of the suburb of Glen Forrest . Beyond the national park , the highway continues to be lined by native trees and patches of remaining forest . It continues east for six kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) between the low @-@ density , rural residential areas of <unk> , Mahogany Creek , and <unk> , before entering the Mundaring town centre . Continuing its journey east , the route leaves Mundaring and travels briefly through the north @-@ eastern corner of <unk> National Park before coming to the rural community of Sawyers Valley , three and a half kilometres ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) east of Mundaring . 
 Beyond Sawyers Valley , Great Eastern Highway travels in a north @-@ easterly direction , alongside and later within the northernmost part of the Jarrahdale State Forest . After 6 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 1 mi ) , the highway reaches the Old Northam Road turnoff , which offers an alternative route through Chidlow . The highway route bypasses the development by continuing east for 5 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) to The Lakes , where it curves around to the north to meet Great Southern Highway , at the edge of the Perth Metropolitan Region . 
 = = = East to Kalgoorlie = = = 
 Great Eastern Highway continues past The Lakes in a northerly direction , reduced to a single carriageway with one lane in each direction . Five kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) later , the highway encounters the north @-@ eastern end of Old Northam Road , and subsequently winds its way through a reverse curve . It travels in between Acacia Prison and Wooroloo Prison Farm and then alongside Wooroloo Brook , for 3 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 3 mi ) , before crossing the waterway . The highway then heads in a north @-@ easterly direction , passing to the south of Wundowie , through Bakers Hill , and reaching Clackline after 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) . Another 12 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 7 mi ) takes Great Eastern Highway to Mitchell Avenue , the turnoff for Northam , and part of the highway 's former route through the town . The highway takes an 11 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometre ( 7 @.@ 3 mi ) curve around the northern edge of Northam , meeting up with the eastern section of the former alignment , known as Yilgarn Avenue . This section of highway , also known as the Northam Bypass , intersects three other roads at grade separated interchanges : Northam – Toodyay Road , Irishtown Road , and Northam – Pithara Road . Each interchange consists of a flyover bridge for the highway , and a single two @-@ way ramp that connects to each road at a T junction . 
 The highway heads east through the Wheatbelt as the region 's main east @-@ west route . The road passes by agricultural land and remnant native vegetation , intermittently encountering small settlements and towns such as <unk> , Cunderdin , <unk> , and <unk> . Great Eastern Highway enters Southern Cross 265 kilometres ( 165 mi ) out from Northam , near the edge of the Wheatbelt . The landscape changes to low shrubland , with few signs of human activity other than the highway itself , and the mostly parallel water pipeline and power line . The road continues eastwards in this fashion over a vast distance of 285 kilometres ( 177 mi ) before reaching the town of Coolgardie . Three hundred metres ( 980 ft ) beyond the townsite , traffic bound for South Australia turns south onto Coolgardie – Esperance Highway , following the National Highway 94 route . Great Eastern Highway , now signposted as Alternate National Route 94 , turns north @-@ east , travelling through another 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) of scrubland to the outskirts of Kalgoorlie . The road continues its journey eastward within the grid of Kalgoorlie 's road system , initially passing by the industrial district of West Kalgoorlie . After 1 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , the highway once more becomes a dual carriageway , and travels past residential neighbourhoods . Following 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) , the highway takes on the name Hannan Street , and continues for 3 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) through to downtown Kalgoorlie , terminating at Goldfields Highway on Kalgoorlie 's eastern edge . Alternate Route 94 turns south , back towards the National Highway route .

 A road along what is now Great Eastern Highway has existed since the convict era of Western Australia . The original road is thought to have been constructed in 1867 , using convict labour , with a road base made of jarrah tree trunks cut into disc shapes . The use of wooden discs as a road base had been proposed by Western Australian Governor John Hampton , leading them to be known as " Hampton 's Cheeses " . The discs were approximately 30 centimetres ( 1 ft ) thick and as large as 90 centimetres ( 3 ft ) in diameter , and the gaps between pieces would have been filled with soil or lime . The same type of road is known to have existed along Stirling Highway , Guildford Road , Albany Highway and Wanneroo Road in the 1860s , and would have prevented horses and carts from getting bogged in wet weather . Evidence of this original road was found in Belmont in 1948 when widening works uncovered jarrah discs . During upgrade works in 2012 , more discs were discovered beneath the existing asphalt , over a twenty @-@ metre ( 66 ft ) stretch .

 The name Great Eastern Highway was coined by the Perth Road Board in December 1933 . It was suggested for the Perth to Guildford road on the north side of the Swan River ( now known as Guildford Road ) , as an alternative to the Bassendean Road Board 's proposal , Perth Road . In February 1934 , the Bassendean Road Board agreed to the name , as Perth Road would be too general , and the road was considered the main artery serving eastern districts , all the way through to Kalgoorlie . Other local governments in the area considered the issue over the next few months . The Bayswater Road Board and Greenmount Road Board were in favour of the idea , but Guildford Road Board was opposed , as several local road names would be lost . Greenmount , and public advertising , thereafter referred to the road as Great Eastern Highway , and the council wrote to the Main Roads Department , requesting the name change be gazetted . This prompted Main Roads to write to other local governments , advising of the request and soliciting their views . The Mundaring Road Board and <unk> Road Board were supportive , while the Kalgoorlie Road Board suggested Great Eastern Goldfields Highway . The Kalgoorlie Municipal Council agreed that the road should be known as a highway , but thought the name was inadequate for a road that only connected Midland Junction with Coolgardie . The Midland Junction Municipal Council opposed the renaming , citing " sentimental and practical reasons for the continuance of the use of the old name " . 
 In August 1934 , the Bassendean Road Board applied to the Lands Department to change the portion of the Perth – Guildford road within its district to Great Eastern Highway . The department refused the request , reasoning that most traffic bound for Midland used The Causeway and travelled on the south side of the Swan River , and that therefore the Perth – Guildford road should not be part of the main highway . Despite this setback , the Perth Road Board organised a local government conference to consider renaming the road from Perth to Guildford . The issue was considered important , as losing the name to the south side of the river would divert traffic away from the old established centres to the north . The straightening of dangerous bends and the replacement of an old bridge between Bassendean and Guildford were also to be considered . The conference , held on 7 September 1934 , was attended by representatives of the Perth , Bayswater , Bassendean , and Guildford road boards , and the Midland Junction Council . Guildford and Midland Junction were still opposed to the renaming , but the others were supportive . Motions that passed included submitting a rename proposal to the state government , urging the government to construct a new bridge at Bassendean , and approaching the government to have the road declared a main road . 
 In November 1934 , the state government Land Council contacted the local governments on the south side of the Swan River , asking them to rename the roads that make up the Causeway – Midland route as Great Eastern Highway . Both the Perth City Council and Belmont Park Road Board agreed to the request . This created a " peculiar situation " , as described by the RAC , with roads both north and south of the Swan River proposed to be renamed as Great Eastern Highway . Despite the name change not being official , some residents along the road through Belmont started describing their properties as located on Great Eastern Highway . 
 Another conference of the local governments north of the river was held in December 1934 . They decided to continue to pursue renaming the Perth – Guildford road to Great Eastern Highway , and having it gazetted as a main road . A letter from the Commissioner of Main Roads had stated that the road through Belmont was considered the principal highway to the eastern states . He therefore recommended that if the name Great Eastern Highway were to be applied west of Midland Junction , it should be to that road , as the road through Bassendean was not considered a main road . Traffic counts collected by the Bassendean Road Board , however , showed that the north of river route , through Bassendean , carried more traffic in both directions than the southern route , through Belmont – 54 % compared to 46 % . The northern route was also shorter by about two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , and considered by the local governments to be the " natural entrance to the city " , only crossing the Swan River once and not again at the Causeway . 
 On 8 January 1935 , representatives from the local governments north of the river urged Minister for Lands , Michael Troy , to rename the Perth – Guildford road through those areas as Great Eastern Highway . Despite the route being shorter and carrying more traffic , he refused . He said that it was not gazetted as main road , and a previous decision to rename the road through Belmont as Great Eastern Highway was made after considering the facts , and at the request of the Main Roads Board . There was resentment and an objection over the name being " pinched " from the Perth Road Board . The minister disregarded the objection . He advised the representatives to see the Minister for Works to get the road declared a main road , and then approach him with a new name . This resolved Great Eastern Highway 's route , with the local governments north of the river pursuing other names such as Main Highway . 
 On 14 April 1938 , the name Great Eastern Highway was gazetted , in accordance with section 10 of the Land Act , 1933 – 1937 . It replaced the names previously used along the route : Ascot Road , Guildford Road , York Road , Guildford – Northam Road , Toodyay – Northam Road , Mitchell Avenue , <unk> Road , Sermon Road , Dreyer Road , Goldfields Road , Kalgoorlie Road , Woodward Street , and Coolgardie Road .

 By 1950 , the highway had been sealed from Perth to Southern Cross , and from a few miles west of Coolgardie to Kalgoorlie . Traffic in the Goldfields was light , with an average daily traffic of 44 vehicles between Southern Cross and Coolgardie , and 33 from Coolgardie to Kalgoorlie . The road was completely sealed by 1953 . Between 1954 and 1956 , sections of the highway between Perth and Southern Cross were improved . The works included increasing the seal width along 38 miles ( 61 km ) of the road , reconstructing 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of road , and resealing 23 @.@ 5 miles ( 37 @.@ 8 km ) . <unk> concrete structures were used to replace two old , narrow wooden bridges . 
 In the 1950s , roundabouts were constructed at each end of The Causeway , to improve the flow of traffic on the bridges and the distribution of traffic back into the road network . The roundabout at the eastern end , connecting with Great Eastern Highway , opened in 1952 . In 1973 construction began on upgrading that intersection to a grade @-@ separated partial cloverleaf interchange . The interchange opened on 8 March 1974 , having cost AUS $ 1 @.@ 3 million . 
 A major accident occurred at the intersection with Roe Highway on 30 December 1993 . A truck lost control coming down Greenmount Hill and rolled over at the intersection , after crashing into six vehicles on the hill and another 14 at the intersection . One woman was killed , and another 12 people were injured , including four with serious injuries . It was Western Australia 's worst accident that year , according to police , with the aftermath described by a witness as " like a battlefield " . This accident led to the construction of a truck arrester bed near the bottom of the hill . It has been used in emergencies several times since . 
 In 1994 , the federal government approved a $ 43 @.@ 9 million project to upgrade substandard sections of Great Eastern Highway between Northam and Southern Cross . That portion of the highway was one of the oldest sections of the National Highway within Western Australia . The road was susceptible to failure due to poor drainage and frequent flooding . Further works in the 1990s saw a second carriageway constructed from Mundaring to Sawyers Valley , and then extended to The Lakes at the edge of Perth . A dual carriageway was also constructed in Kalgoorlie , and a long overtaking lane was built near Clackline . 
 More recent works have improved sections of the highway in Perth . Great Eastern Highway 's intersection with Roe Highway was upgraded to a grade separated interchange . The design is a diamond interchange , with free @-@ flowing traffic on Roe Highway , and an additional looped ramp for northbound to eastbound traffic movements . Construction of the $ 101 @.@ 5 million project began in late 2010 , and the interchange was officially opened to traffic on 9 June 2012 . Another project undertaken was the widening of the highway through the suburbs of <unk> , Belmont and Redcliffe – between Kooyong Road , just north @-@ east of the Graham Farmer Freeway interchange , and Tonkin Highway . Work commenced in June 2011 , and was completed in February 2013 , nine months earlier than scheduled . Prime Minister Julia Gillard opened the upgraded highway on 28 March 2013 , participating in a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony . The $ 280 million upgrade included construction of a median strip , widening the road to three lanes in each direction , bus priority lanes at several traffic light controlled intersections , and bicycle lanes . The upgrade was expected to reduce congestion along the highway , which had been one of Perth 's worst accident spots in 2011 / 12 . However , the accidents were usually not serious , and roadworks were considered a " major contributing factor " . In October 2013 , the project was recognised with the Civil Contractors Federation National Earth Award for Excellence . 
 = = = Bypasses = = = 
 Great Eastern Highway Bypass , together with Roe Highway , provides a limited @-@ access bypass of Guildford and Midland town sites . The 5 @.@ 6 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 5 mi ) bypass branches off the original highway alignment at South Guildford , proceeds around the northern edge of Perth Airport , and then heads east through <unk> . At the eastern end of Great Eastern Highway Bypass , traffic returns to the main highway by heading north on Roe Highway for three kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) . Plans for a major highway along a similar alignment date back to Gordon Stephenson and Alistair Hepburn 's 1955 " Plan for the Metropolitan Region " , which was the precursor of Perth 's Metropolitan Region Scheme . The road was constructed in the late 1980s , and was known as the Redcliffe – <unk> Highway during construction . Great Eastern Highway Bypass was opened on 14 May 1988 , after 21 months of construction , and at a cost of $ 10 million . 
 Planning for a bypass around Northam began in the 1960s . The original route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route , including for heavy vehicles . There were particular concerns with the amount of traffic congestion , frequency of crashes , and the noise and visual pollution of the highway 's traffic . Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass , which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s . In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal , and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable . The closer routes were not acceptable due to the potential impact on the Avon River . The project gained the Minister for the Environment 's conditional approval on 24 June 1994 . Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001 , with the new road opened on 17 May 2002 . 
 A bypass of Clackline was also constructed , realigning 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) of Great Eastern Highway 100 metres ( 330 ft ) north of the town . Works began in January 2007 , and were completed in February 2008 . The project also involved constructing overtaking lanes between Clackline and Bakers Hill , upgrading intersections in Clackline , and constructing a pedestrian underpass for a heritage trail . Clackline Brook was realigned through a large box culvert , allowing a safer crossing than the narrow Clackline Bridge on the original alignment . The bypass was originally allocated $ 2 @.@ 4 million of funding in 2006 , but by January 2007 it was expected to cost almost $ 11 million . The final project value was $ 9 @.@ 2 million . Issues and challenges in the project 's design and construction included extensive rock protection requirements for the Clackline Brook culvert , drilling and blasting close to the existing highway , and protecting heritage and environmentally sensitive areas . The Clackline community welcomed the bypass , but there were concerns that the historic Clackline Bridge would be lost . The bridge has since received a permanent entry on the Heritage Council of Western Australia 's Register of Heritage Places , in November 2008 .

 There are long @-@ term plans to bypass Great Eastern Highway 's current ascent of the Darling Scarp . Planning for a new major road network in Perth 's eastern corridor began in the 1970s . Early planning efforts between 1978 and 1981 for a new highway reservation from Mundaring to Wooroloo encountered community opposition , and the Environmental Protection Authority ( EPA ) requested a more detailed environmental assessment . In 1985 , a study into the primary east @-@ west traffic routes in the area was commissioned by the Main Roads Department , Metropolitan Region Planning Authority , Shire of Mundaring , and Shire of Swan . It recommended a new alignment , known as the " Orange Route " , be selected for the Perth to Adelaide National Highway . Alternative routes were identified using other colours as codenames . The new national highway would travel north @-@ east along Toodyay Road from Roe Highway to beyond <unk> , and then deviate east via the proposed Orange Route to meet Great Eastern Highway near Wundowie . The ultimate design of the highway included grade @-@ separated interchanges for all of the roads that it intersects . The Orange Route received environmental approval on 22 November 1989 . Detailed planning for the Clackline to Wooroloo section of the Orange Route was to begin in 1998 . As of 2012 , construction of the Orange Route is not a priority for Main Roads . The project was not in the forward works program , there was no indication of the expected starting date , and a cost – benefit analysis had not been performed recently . Plans are still in development , but the federal government is responsible for financing the project .

 = Battle of Maysalun = 
 The Battle of Maysalun ( Arabic : معركة <unk> ) , also called the Battle of Maysalun Pass or the Battle of Khan Maysalun , was a battle fought between the forces of the Arab Kingdom of Syria and the French Army of the Levant on 24 July 1920 near Khan Maysalun in the Anti @-@ Lebanon Mountains , about 25 kilometers ( 16 mi ) west of Damascus 
 As part of the British @-@ backed Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire , the Arab forces of the Sharifian army under Emir Faisal captured Damascus in October 1918 . An Arab government under Faisal was subsequently formed in Syria , but it was not recognized internationally . Instead , France and Great Britain had agreed to divide the Arab territories of the Ottoman Empire among themselves , despite earlier British promises to the Sharifian leadership that the Arab territories would form part of a Sharifian @-@ ruled state in return for Arab participation in the British war effort . French attempts to establish control over Syria were challenged by its inhabitants and government , and in March 1920 , the Arab Kingdom of Syria was proclaimed with Faisal as king . A month later , Syria was allocated to France as a mandate by the League of Nations . The battle of Maysalun occurred as France sought to assert its claim over Damascus and topple Faisal 's government . 
 Prior to the engagement at Maysalun , General Henri Gouraud of France issued an ultimatum to Faisal , demanding that he disband his rudimentary Arab Army , a demand to which Faisal ultimately acceded . However , by the time Faisal communicated his agreement , French forces had launched an offensive towards Damascus from Lebanon , and Faisal 's war minister , General Yusuf al- ' Azma , set out to confront them with the remnants of the Arab Army and Damascene volunteers . During the battle , the better @-@ equipped French forces under the command of General Mariano Goybet defeated the Syrian forces of al- ' Azma , who was killed in action . French troops entered Damascus the following day , encountering little resistance . Soon after , Faisal was expelled from Syria . Despite the Arab Army 's decisive defeat , the Battle of Maysalun became a symbol in Syria and the Arab world of desperate courage against a stronger imperial power . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 30 October 1918 , towards the end of World War I , the Sharifian Army led by Emir Faisal , backed by the British Army , captured Damascus from the Ottomans as part of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire . The war ended less than a month after the Sharifian – British conquest of Damascus . In correspondences between the Sharifian leadership in Mecca and Henry McMahon , the British high commissioner in Cairo , the latter promised to support the establishment of a Sharifian kingdom in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire in return for launching a revolt against the Ottomans . However , the British and French governments made previous arrangements regarding the division of the Ottomans ' Arab provinces between themselves in the 1916 Sykes @-@ Picot Agreement . 
 To allay his fears regarding his throne in Syria , Faisal attended the January 1919 Paris Conference , where he was not recognized by the French government as the sovereign ruler of Syria ; Faisal called for Syrian sovereignty under his rule , but the European powers attending the conference called for European mandates to be established over the former Arab territories of the Ottoman Empire . In the US @-@ led June 1919 King – Crane Commission , which published its conclusions in 1922 , the commission determined that the people of Syria overwhelmingly rejected French rule . Furthermore , Emir Faisal stated to the commission that " French rule would mean certain death to Syrians as a distinguished people " . 
 French forces commanded by General Henri Gouraud landed in Beirut on 18 November 1919 , with the ultimate goal of bringing all of Syria under French control . Shortly thereafter , French forces deployed to the Beqaa Valley , a wide area between Beirut and Damascus . Against King Faisal 's wishes , his delegate to General Gouraud , Nuri al @-@ Said , agreed to the French deployment and the disbandment of Arab troops from al @-@ Mu <unk> , near Zahle . The agreement between al @-@ Said and Gouraud was contrary to an earlier agreement Faisal had made with French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau , which held that French troops would not deploy in the Beqaa Valley until the League of Nations ruled on the matter . Faisal condemned al @-@ Said and accused of him of treachery . Following the Arab Army withdrawal from al @-@ Mu <unk> , Christian militiamen from Zahle raided the town , prompting attacks from local Muslim militiamen , which forced several Christian families to the coast . Amid these developments , armed groups of rebels and bandits emerged throughout the Beqaa Valley . When a French officer in Baalbek was assaulted by Shia Muslim rebels opposed to the French presence , Gouraud believed the Arab government was responsible for the act and demanded that it apologize , which it did not . In response , Gouraud violated his agreement with al @-@ Said and occupied Baalbek . The French deployment along the Syrian coast and the Beqaa Valley provoked unrest throughout Syria and sharpened political divisions between the political camp that called for confronting the French and the camp that sought compromise . 
 On 8 March 1920 , the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Kingdom of Syria , with Faisal as king . This unilateral action was immediately rejected by the British and French . In the San Remo Conference , which was called by the Allied Powers in April 1920 , the allocation of mandates in the Arab territories was finalized , with France given a mandate over Syria . France 's allocation of Syria was , in turn , repudiated by Faisal and the Syrian National Congress . After months of instability and failure to make good on the promises Faisal had made to the French , General Gouraud gave an ultimatum to Faisal on 14 July 1920 demanding that he disband the Arab Army and submit to French authority by 20 July or face a French military invasion . On 18 July , Faisal and the entire cabinet , with the exception of War Minister Yusuf al- ' Azma , agreed to the ultimatum and issued disbandment orders for the Arab Army units at Anjar , the Beirut – Damascus road and the hills of the Anti @-@ Lebanon Mountains overlooking the Beqaa Valley . Two days later , Faisal informed the French liaison in Damascus of his acceptance of the ultimatum , but for unclear reasons , Faisal 's notification did not reach Gouraud until 21 July . Sources suspicious of French intentions accused the French of intentionally delaying delivery of the notice to give Gouraud an official excuse for advancing on Damascus . However , there has been no evidence or indication of French sabotage . News of the disbandment and Faisal 's submission led to riots in Damascus on 20 July and their suppression by Emir Zeid , which led to around 200 deaths . Al- ' Azma , who was staunchly opposed to surrender , implored Faisal to give him and the remnants of his army the opportunity to confront the French . 
 = = = Prelude = = = 
 On 22 July , Faisal dispatched Education Minister Sati al @-@ Husri and the Arab government 's former Beirut representative , Jamil al @-@ <unk> , to meet Gouraud at his headquarters in Aley and persuade him to end his army 's advance to Damascus . Gouraud responded by extending the ultimatum by one day and with new , more stringent conditions , namely that France be allowed to establish a mission in Damascus to supervise the implementation of the original ultimatum and the establishment of the French mandate . Al @-@ Husri returned to Damascus the same day to communicate Gouraud 's message to Faisal , who called for a meeting of the cabinet on 23 July to consider the new ultimatum . Colonel <unk> , a French liaison officer to Damascus , interrupted the meeting with a demand from Gouraud that the French army be allowed to advance toward Maysalun , where water wells were abundant . Gouraud had originally planned to launch the offensive against Damascus from Ayn al @-@ <unk> , a spring in the Anti @-@ Lebanon Range , but the lack of water sources there amid the steep , barren mountains led to a change of plans . Accordingly , Gouraud sought to occupy Khan Maysalun , an isolated caravanserai on the Beirut – Damascus road situated at the crest of the Wadi al @-@ Qarn mountain pass in the Anti @-@ Lebanon , located 25 kilometers ( 16 mi ) west of Damascus . Gouraud was also motivated to occupy Khan Maysalun because of its proximity to the Hejaz Railway . 
 <unk> 's message confirmed the fears of Faisal 's cabinet that Gouraud was intent on taking over Syria by force . The cabinet subsequently rejected Gouraud 's ultimatum and issued a largely symbolic appeal to the international community to end the French advance . On 23 July , Al- ' Azma set out from Damascus with his motley force of army regulars and volunteers , which was divided into northern , central and southern columns each headed by camel cavalry units . French forces launched their offensive towards Khan Maysalun and Wadi al @-@ Qarn shortly after dawn on 24 July , at 5 : 00 , while Syrian forces were waiting at their positions overlooking the low end of Wadi al @-@ Qarn . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The first clashes took place at 6 : 30 when French tank divisions stormed the central position of the Syrian defensive line while French cavalry and infantry units assaulted the Syrians ' northern and southern positions . The camel cavalry were the first Syrian units to engage the French . Syrian forces initially put up stiff resistance along the front , but lacked coordination between their different units . Early in the clashes , Syrian artillery fire inflicted casualties on a battery of French soldiers . French tanks faced heavy fire as they attempted to gain ground against the Syrians . However , French artillery took a toll on Syrian forces and by 8 : 30 the French had broken the Syrians ' central trench . At one point in the first few hours of the clashes , Syrian forces managed to briefly pin down two Senegalese companies that were relatively isolated on the French right flank . The losses inflicted on the two Senegalese units represented roughly half of the French army 's total casualties . Nonetheless , by 10 : 00 , the battle was effectively over , having turned decisively in favor of the French . 
 At 10 : 30 , French forces reached al- ' Azma 's headquarters , unhindered by the mines laid en route by the Syrians . Little information is known about the battle from the Syrian side . According to one version , when French forces were about 100 meters in the distance , al- ' Azma rushed to a Syrian artilleryman stationed near him and demanded him to open fire . However , before any shells could be fired , a French tank unit spotted al- ' Azma and gunned him down with machine gun fire . In another account of events , al- ' Azma had attempted to mine the trenches as the French forces approached his position , but was shot down by the French before he could set off the charges . Al- ' Azma 's death marked the end of the battle , although intermittent clashes continued until 13 : 30 . Surviving Syrian fighters were bombed from the air and harried by the French as they retreated toward Damascus . 
 After the battle , General Gouraud addressed General Goybet as follows : 
 GENERAL ORDER No. 22 
 Aley , 24 July 1920 
 " The General is deeply happy to address his congratulations to General Goybet and his valiant troops : 415th of line , 2nd Algerian sharpshooters , 11th and 10th Senegalese sharpshooters , light @-@ infantry @-@ men of Africa , Moroccan trooper regiment , batteries of African groups , batteries of 155 , 314 , company of tanks , bombardment groups and squadrons who in the hard fight of 24 of July , have broken the resistance of the enemy who defied us for 8 months ... They have engraved a glorious page in the history of our country . " – General Gouraud 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Initial estimates of the casualties which claimed 2 @,@ 000 Syrian dead and 800 French casualties turned out to be exaggerated . The French Army claimed 42 of its soldiers were killed , 152 wounded and 14 missing in action , while around 150 Syrian fighters were killed and 1 @,@ 500 wounded . King Faisal observed the battle unfold from the village of al @-@ <unk> , and as it became apparent that the Syrians had been routed , he and his cabinet , with the exception of Interior Minister ' Ala al @-@ Din al @-@ Durubi , who had quietly secured a deal with the French , departed for al @-@ Kiswah , a town located at the southern approaches of Damascus . 
 French forces had captured Aleppo on 23 July without a fight , and after their victory at Maysalun , French troops besieged and captured Damascus on 25 July . Within a short time , the majority of Faisal 's forces fled or surrendered to the French , although parties of Arab groups opposed to French rule continued to resist before being quickly defeated . King Faisal returned to Damascus on 25 July and asked al @-@ Durubi to form a government , although al @-@ Durubi had already decided on the composition of his cabinet , which was confirmed by the French . General Gouraud condemned Faisal 's rule in Syria , accusing him of having " dragged the country to within an inch of destruction " , and stating that because of this , it was " utterly impossible for him to remain in the country " . Faisal denounced Gouraud 's statement and insisted that he remained the sovereign head of Syria whose authority he was " granted by the Syrian people " . 
 Although he verbally dismissed the French order expelling him and his family from Syria , Faisal departed Damascus on 27 July with only one of his cabinet members , al @-@ Husri . He initially traveled south to Daraa in the Hauran region where he gained the allegiance of local tribal leaders . However , a French ultimatum to the tribal leaders to expel Faisal or face the bombardment of their encampments compelled Faisal to head west to Haifa in British @-@ held Palestine on 1 August and avoid further bloodshed . Faisal 's departure from Syria marked an end to his goal of establishing and leading an Arab state in Syria .

 Estimates of the combined size of the French Army of the Levant divisions that participated in the battle ranged from 9 @,@ 000 to 12 @,@ 000 troops . The troops were mostly made up of Senegalese and Algerian units , and consisted of ten infantry battalions and a number of cavalry and artillery units . Among the participating units were the 415th Infantry Regiment , the 2nd Algerian Riflemen Regiment , the Senegalese Division , the African Riflemen Regiment and the Moroccan <unk> Battalion . A number of Maronite volunteers from Mount Lebanon reportedly joined the French forces as well . The Army of the Levant was equipped with plain and mountain artillery batteries and 155mm guns , and backed by tanks and fighter bombers . The commander of the French forces was General Mariano Goybet .

Estimates put the number of Arab Army soldiers and local irregulars at around 4 @,@ 000 . Most Arab Army units had already been disbanded days prior to the battle by order of King Faisal as part of his acceptance of the terms set out in General Gouraud 's 14 July ultimatum . According to historian Eliezer Tauber , al- ' Azma recruited 3 @,@ 000 soldiers and volunteers , and of them only 1 @,@ 400 participated in the battle . 
 Part of the civilian militia units were assembled and led by Yasin Kiwan , a Damascene merchant , Abd al @-@ Qadir Kiwan , the former imam of the Umayyad Mosque , and Shaykh Hamdi al @-@ <unk> , a Muslim scholar . Yasin and Abd al @-@ Qadir were killed during the battle . Shaykh Muhammad al @-@ <unk> also participated in the battle with 40 – 50 of his men from the Midan quarter of Damascus . Other Muslim preachers and scholars from Damascus , including Tawfiq al @-@ Darra ( ex @-@ mufti of the Ottoman Fifth Army ) , Sa 'id al @-@ <unk> ( preacher at the Tuba Mosque ) , Muhammad al @-@ Fahl ( scholar from the <unk> Madrasa ) and Ali <unk> ( preacher at the Sinan Pasha Mosque ) also participated in the battle . 
 The Syrians were equipped with rifles discarded by retreating Ottoman soldiers during World War I and those used by the Sharifian Army 's Bedouin cavalry during the 1916 Arab Revolt . The Syrians also possessed a number of machine guns and about 15 artillery batteries . According to various versions , ammunition was low , with 120 – 250 bullets per rifle , 45 bullets per machine gun , and 50 – 80 shells per cannon . Part of this ammunition was also unusable because many bullet and rifle types did not correspond to each other .

 The French took control of the territory that became the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon . France divided Syria into smaller statelets centered on certain regions and sects , including Greater Lebanon for the Maronites , Jabal al @-@ Druze State for the Druze in Hauran , the Alawite State for the Alawites in the Syrian coastal mountains and the states of Damascus and Aleppo . Gouraud reportedly went to the tomb of Saladin , kicked it , and said : " Awake , Saladin . We have returned . My presence here consecrates victory of the Cross over the Crescent . " 
 Although the Syrians were decisively defeated , the Battle of Maysalun " has gone down in Arab history as a synonym for heroism and hopeless courage against huge odds , as well as for treachery and betrayal " , according to Iraqi historian Ali al @-@ Allawi . According to British journalist Robert Fisk , the Battle of Maysalun was " a struggle which every Syrian learns at school but about which almost every Westerner is ignorant " . Historian Tareq Y. Ismael wrote that following the battle , the " Syrian resistance at Khan Maysalun soon took on epic proportions . It was viewed as an Arab attempt to stop the imperial avalanche . " He also states that the Syrians ' defeat caused popular attitudes in the Arab world that exist until the present day which hold that the Western world dishonors the commitments it makes to the Arab people and " oppresses anyone who stands in the way of its imperial designs . " Sati ' al @-@ Husri , a major pan @-@ Arabist thinker , asserted that the battle was " one of the most important events in the modern history of the Arab nation . " The event was annually commemorated by Syrians , during which thousands would visit the grave of al- ' Azma in Maysalun .

 Goliath is a steel inverted roller coaster manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard currently operating at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio , Texas since April 18 , 2008 . In the roller coaster 's lifetime , it has operated at two other amusement parks : Thrill Valley from 1995 to May 6 , 2002 , and Six Flags New Orleans from April 12 , 2003 to August 21 , 2005 when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans . Goliath 's highest point is 105 feet ( 32 m ) , the trains can reach a top speed of 50 miles per hour ( 80 km / h ) , and the length of the track is approximately 2 @,@ 693 feet ( 821 m ) .

The ride re @-@ opened at Six Flags New Orleans on April 12 , 2003 . 
 On August 21 , 2005 before Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans , Six Flags closed the park as a safety precaution . Due to substantial flooding , many of the park 's rides were damaged beyond repair causing the park to remain standing but not operating . In 2007 , Six Flags moved Batman : The Ride to Six Flags Fiesta Texas , considering it to be the only salvageable ride due to its elevated station platform and corrosion @-@ resistant support structure , which caused it to make it through Hurricane Katrina relatively unscathed .

 = Peak oil = 
 Peak oil , an event based on M. King Hubbert 's theory , is the point in time when the maximum rate of extraction of petroleum is reached , after which it is expected to enter terminal decline . Peak oil theory is based on the observed rise , peak , fall , and depletion of aggregate production rate in oil fields over time . It is often confused with oil depletion ; however , peak oil is the point of maximum production , while depletion refers to a period of falling reserves and supply . 
 Some observers , such as petroleum industry experts Kenneth S. Deffeyes and Matthew Simmons , predict negative global economy implications following a post @-@ peak production decline and subsequent oil price increase because of the high dependence of most modern industrial transport , agricultural , and industrial systems on the low cost and high availability of oil . Predictions vary greatly as to what exactly these negative effects would be . 
 Oil production forecasts on which predictions of peak oil are based are often made within a range which includes optimistic ( higher production ) and pessimistic ( lower production ) scenarios . Optimistic estimations of peak production forecast the global decline will begin after 2020 , and assume major investments in alternatives will occur before a crisis , without requiring major changes in the lifestyle of heavily oil @-@ consuming nations . Pessimistic predictions of future oil production made after 2007 stated either that the peak had already occurred , that oil production was on the cusp of the peak , or that it would occur shortly . 
 Hubbert 's original prediction that US peak oil would be in about 1970 seemed accurate for a time , as US average annual production peaked in 1970 at 9 @.@ 6 million barrels per day . However , the successful application of massive hydraulic fracturing to additional tight reservoirs caused US production to rebound , challenging the inevitability of post @-@ peak decline for the US oil production . In addition , Hubbert 's original predictions for world peak oil production proved premature . 
 = = Modeling global oil production = = 
 The idea that the rate of oil production would peak and irreversibly decline is an old one . In 1919 , David White , chief geologist of the United States Geological Survey , wrote of US petroleum : " ... the peak of production will soon be passed , possibly within 3 years . " In 1953 , Eugene Ayers , a researcher for Gulf Oil , projected that if US ultimate recoverable oil reserves were 100 billion barrels , then production in the US would peak no later than 1960 . If ultimate recoverable were to be as high as 200 billion barrels , which he warned was wishful thinking , US peak production would come no later than 1970 . Likewise for the world , he projected a peak somewhere between 1985 ( one trillion barrels ultimate recoverable ) and 2000 ( two trillion barrels recoverable ) . Ayers made his projections without a mathematical model . He wrote : " But if the curve is made to look reasonable , it is quite possible to adapt mathematical expressions to it and to determine , in this way , the peak dates corresponding to various ultimate recoverable reserve numbers " 
 By observing past discoveries and production levels , and predicting future discovery trends , the geoscientist M. King Hubbert used statistical modelling in 1956 to accurately predict that United States oil production would peak between 1965 and 1971 . Hubbert used a semi @-@ logistical curved model ( sometimes incorrectly compared to a normal distribution ) . He assumed the production rate of a limited resource would follow a roughly symmetrical distribution . Depending on the limits of <unk> and market pressures , the rise or decline of resource production over time might be sharper or more stable , appear more linear or curved . That model and its variants are now called Hubbert peak theory ; they have been used to describe and predict the peak and decline of production from regions , countries , and multinational areas . The same theory has also been applied to other limited @-@ resource production . 
 In a 2006 analysis of Hubbert theory , it was noted that uncertainty in real world oil production amounts and confusion in definitions increases the uncertainty in general of production predictions . By comparing the fit of various other models , it was found that Hubbert 's methods yielded the closest fit over all , but that none of the models were very accurate . In 1956 Hubbert himself recommended using " a family of possible production curves " when predicting a production peak and decline curve . 
 More recently , the term " peak oil " was popularized by Colin Campbell and Kjell <unk> in 2002 when they helped form the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas ( ASPO ) . In his publications , Hubbert used the term " peak production rate " and " peak in the rate of discoveries " . 
 = = Demand = = 
 The demand side of peak oil over time is concerned with the total quantity of oil that the global market would choose to consume at various possible market prices and how this entire listing of quantities at various prices would evolve over time . Global demand for crude oil grew an average of 1 @.@ 76 % per year from 1994 to 2006 , with a high growth of 3 @.@ 4 % in 2003 – 2004 . After reaching a high of 85 @.@ 6 million barrels ( 13 @,@ 610 @,@ 000 m3 ) per day in 2007 , world consumption decreased in both 2008 and 2009 by a total of 1 @.@ 8 % , despite fuel costs plummeting in 2008 . Despite this lull , world quantity @-@ demanded for oil is projected to increase 21 % over 2007 levels by 2030 ( 104 million barrels per day ( 16 @.@ 5 × 10 ^ 6 m3 / d ) from 86 million barrels ( 13 @.@ 7 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) ) , or about 0 @.@ 8 % average annual growth , due in large part to increases in demand from the transportation sector . According to projections by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) in 2013 , growth in global oil demand will be significantly outpaced by growth in production capacity over the next 5 years . Developments in late 2014 – 2015 have seen an oversupply of global markets leading to a significant drop in the price of oil . 
 Energy demand is distributed amongst four broad sectors : transportation , residential , commercial , and industrial . In terms of oil use , transportation is the largest sector and the one that has seen the largest growth in demand in recent decades . This growth has largely come from new demand for personal @-@ use vehicles powered by internal combustion engines . This sector also has the highest consumption rates , accounting for approximately 71 % of the oil used in the United States in 2013 @.@ and 55 % of oil use worldwide as documented in the Hirsch report . Transportation is therefore of particular interest to those seeking to mitigate the effects of peak oil . 
 Although demand growth is highest in the developing world , the United States is the world 's largest consumer of petroleum . Between 1995 and 2005 , US consumption grew from 17 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 2 @,@ 810 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) to 20 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 3 @,@ 290 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) , a 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 480 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) increase . China , by comparison , increased consumption from 3 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 540 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) to 7 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) , an increase of 3 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 570 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) , in the same time frame . The Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) stated that gasoline usage in the United States may have peaked in 2007 , in part because of increasing interest in and mandates for use of biofuels and energy efficiency . 
 As countries develop , industry and higher living standards drive up energy use , oil usage being a major component . Thriving economies , such as China and India , are quickly becoming large oil consumers . For example , China surpassed the United States as the world 's largest crude oil importer in 2015 . Oil consumption growth is expected to continue ; however , not at previous rates , as China 's economic growth is predicted to decrease from the high rates of the early part of the 21st century . India 's oil imports are expected to more than triple from 2005 levels by 2020 , rising to 5 million barrels per day ( 790 × 103 m3 / d ) . 
 = = = Population = = = 
 Another significant factor affecting petroleum demand has been human population growth . The United States Census Bureau predicts that world population in 2030 will be almost double that of 1980 . Oil production per capita peaked in 1979 at 5 @.@ 5 barrels / year but then declined to fluctuate around 4 @.@ 5 barrels / year since . In this regard , the decreasing population growth rate since the 1970s has somewhat ameliorated the per capita decline . 
 = = = Economic growth = = = 
 Some analysts argue that the cost of oil has a profound effect on economic growth due to its pivotal role in the extraction of resources and the processing , manufacturing , and transportation of goods . As the industrial effort to extract new unconventional oil sources increases , this has a compounding negative effect on all sectors of the economy , leading to economic stagnation or even eventual contraction . Such a scenario would result in an inability for national economies to pay high oil prices , leading to declining demand and a price collapse . 
 = = Supply = = 
 Our analysis suggests there are ample physical oil and liquid fuel resources for the foreseeable future . However , the rate at which new supplies can be developed and the break @-@ even prices for those new supplies are changing . 
 = = = Defining sources of oil = = = 
 Oil may come from conventional or unconventional sources . The terms are not strictly defined , and vary within the literature as definitions based on new technologies tend to change over time . As a result , different oil forecasting studies have included different classes of liquid fuels . Some use the terms " conventional " oil for what is included in the model , and " unconventional " oil for classes excluded . 
 In 1956 , Hubbert confined his peak oil prediction to that crude oil " producible by methods now in use . " By 1962 , however , his analyses included future improvements in exploration and production . All of Hubbert 's analyses of peak oil specifically excluded oil manufactured from oil shale or mined from oil sands . A 2013 study predicting an early peak excluded deepwater oil , tight oil , oil with API gravity less than 17 @.@ 5 , and oil close to the poles , such as that on the North Slope of Alaska , all of which it defined as non @-@ conventional . Some commonly used definitions for conventional and unconventional oil are detailed below . 
 = = = Conventional sources = = = 
 Conventional oil is extracted on land and offshore using standard techniques , and can be categorized as light , medium , heavy , or extra heavy in grade . The exact definitions of these grades vary depending on the region from which the oil came . Light oil flows naturally to the surface or can be extracted by simply pumping it out of the ground . Heavy refers to oil that has higher density and therefore lower API gravity . It does not flow easily , and its consistency is similar to that of molasses . While some of it can be produced using conventional techniques , recovery rates are better using unconventional methods . 
 = = = Unconventional sources = = = 
 Oil currently considered unconventional is derived from multiple sources . 
 Tight oil is extracted from deposits of low @-@ permeability rock , sometimes shale deposits but often other rock types , using hydraulic fracturing , or " fracking . " It is often confused with shale oil , which is oil manufactured from the kerogen contained in an oil shale ( see below ) , Production of tight oil has led to a resurgence of US production in recent years . However , tight oil production peaked in 2015 and is not expected to increase again until there is a significant oil price recovery . 
 Oil shale is a common term for sedimentary rock such as shale or marl , containing kerogen , a waxy oil precursor that has not yet been transformed into crude oil by the high pressures and temperatures caused by deep burial . The term " oil shale " is somewhat confusing , because what is referred to in the U.S. as " oil shale " is not really oil and the rock it is found in is generally not shale . Since it is close to the surface rather than buried deep in the earth , the shale or marl is typically mined , crushed , and retorted , producing synthetic oil from the kerogen . Its net energy yield is much lower than conventional oil , so much so that estimates of the net energy yield of shale discoveries are considered extremely unreliable . 
 Oil sands are unconsolidated sandstone deposits containing large amounts of very viscous crude bitumen or extra @-@ heavy crude oil that can be recovered by surface mining or by in @-@ situ oil wells using steam injection or other techniques . It can be liquefied by upgrading , blending with diluent , or by heating ; and then processed by a conventional oil refinery . The recovery process requires advanced technology but is more efficient than that of oil shale . The reason is that , unlike U.S. " oil shale " , Canadian oil sands actually contain oil , and the sandstones they are found in are much easier to produce oil from than shale or marl . In the U.S. dialect of English , these formations are often called " tar sands " , but the material found in them is not tar but an extra @-@ heavy and viscous form of oil technically known as bitumen . 
 Coal liquefaction or gas to liquids product are liquid hydrocarbons that are synthesised from the conversion of coal or natural gas by the Fischer @-@ Tropsch process , <unk> process , or Karrick process . Currently , two companies <unk> and Shell , have synthetic oil technology proven to work on a commercial scale . <unk> 's primary business is based on CTL ( coal @-@ to @-@ liquid ) and GTL ( natural gas @-@ to @-@ liquid ) technology , producing US $ 4 @.@ 40 billion in revenues ( <unk> ) . Shell has used these processes to recycle waste flare gas ( usually burnt off at oil wells and refineries ) into usable synthetic oil . However , for CTL there may be insufficient coal reserves to supply global needs for both liquid fuels and electric power generation . 
 Minor sources include thermal <unk> , as discussed in a 2003 article in Discover magazine , that could be used to manufacture oil indefinitely , out of garbage , sewage , and agricultural waste . The article claimed that the cost of the process was $ 15 per barrel . A follow @-@ up article in 2006 stated that the cost was actually $ 80 per barrel , because the feedstock that had previously been considered as hazardous waste now had market value . A 2008 news bulletin published by Los Alamos Laboratory proposed that hydrogen ( possibly produced using hot fluid from nuclear reactors to split water into hydrogen and oxygen ) in combination with sequestered CO2 could be used to produce methanol ( CH3OH ) , which could then be converted into gasoline . 
 = = = Discoveries = = = 
 All the easy oil and gas in the world has pretty much been found . Now comes the harder work in finding and producing oil from more challenging environments and work areas . 
 It is pretty clear that there is not much chance of finding any significant quantity of new cheap oil . Any new or unconventional oil is going to be expensive . 
 The peak of world oilfield discoveries occurred in the 1960s at around 55 billion barrels ( 8 @.@ 7 × 109 m3 ) ( Gb ) / year . According to the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas ( ASPO ) , the rate of discovery has been falling steadily since . Less than 10 Gb / yr of oil were discovered each year between 2002 and 2007 . According to a 2010 Reuters article , the annual rate of discovery of new fields has remained remarkably constant at 15 – 20 Gb / yr . 
 But despite the fall @-@ off in new field discoveries , and record @-@ high production rates , the reported proved reserves of crude oil remaining in the ground in 2014 , which totaled 1 @,@ 490 billion barrels , not counting Canadian heavy oil sands , were more than quadruple the 1965 proved reserves of 354 billion barrels . A researcher for the U.S. Energy Information Administration has pointed out that after the first wave of discoveries in an area , most oil and natural gas reserve growth comes not from discoveries of new fields , but from extensions and additional gas found within existing fields . 
 A report by the UK Energy Research Centre noted that " discovery " is often used ambiguously , and explained the seeming contradiction between falling discovery rates since the 1960s and increasing reserves by the phenomenon of reserve growth . The report noted that increased reserves within a field may be discovered or developed by new technology years or decades after the original discovery . But because of the practice of " backdating , " any new reserves within a field , even those to be discovered decades after the field discovery , are attributed to the year of initial field discovery , creating an illusion that discovery is not keeping pace with production . 
 = = = Reserves = = = 
 Total possible conventional crude oil reserves include crude oil with 90 – 95 % certainty of being technically possible to produce ( from reservoirs through a <unk> using primary , secondary , improved , enhanced , or tertiary methods ) ; all crude with a 50 % probability of being produced in the future ; and discovered reserves that have a 5 – 10 % possibility of being produced in the future . These are referred to as 1P / Proven ( 90 – 95 % ) , 2P / Probable ( 50 % ) , and 3P / Possible ( 5 – 10 % ) , respectively . This does not include liquids extracted from mined solids or gasses ( oil sands , oil shale , gas @-@ to @-@ liquid processes , or coal @-@ to @-@ liquid processes ) . 
 Hubbert 's 1956 peak projection for the United States depended on geological estimates of ultimate recoverable oil resources , but starting in his 1962 publication , he concluded that ultimate oil recovery was an output of his mathematical analysis , rather than an assumption . He regarded his peak oil calculation as independent of reserve <unk> . 
 Many current 2P calculations predict reserves to be between 1150 and 1350 Gb , but some authors have written that because of misinformation , withheld information , and misleading reserve calculations , 2P reserves are likely nearer to 850 – 900 Gb . The Energy Watch Group wrote that actual reserves peaked in 1980 , when production first surpassed new discoveries , that apparent increases in reserves since then are illusory , and concluded ( in 2007 ) : " Probably the world oil production has peaked already , but we cannot be sure yet . " 
 = = = = Concerns over stated reserves = = = = 
 [ World ] reserves are confused and in fact inflated . Many of the so @-@ called reserves are in fact resources . They 're not delineated , they 're not accessible , they 're not available for production . 
 Al @-@ Husseini estimated that 300 billion barrels ( 48 × 10 ^ 9 m3 ) of the world 's 1 @,@ 200 billion barrels ( 190 × 10 ^ 9 m3 ) of proven reserves should be recategorized as speculative resources . 
 One difficulty in forecasting the date of peak oil is the opacity surrounding the oil reserves classified as " proven " . In many major producing countries , the majority of reserves claims have not been subject to outside audit or examination . Many worrying signs concerning the depletion of proven reserves have emerged in recent years . This was best exemplified by the 2004 scandal surrounding the " evaporation " of 20 % of Shell 's reserves . 
 For the most part , proven reserves are stated by the oil companies , the producer states and the consumer states . All three have reasons to overstate their proven reserves : oil companies may look to increase their potential worth ; producer countries gain a stronger international stature ; and governments of consumer countries may seek a means to foster sentiments of security and stability within their economies and among consumers . 
 Major discrepancies arise from accuracy issues with the self @-@ reported numbers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) . Besides the possibility that these nations have overstated their reserves for political reasons ( during periods of no substantial discoveries ) , over 70 nations also follow a practice of not reducing their reserves to account for yearly production . Analysts have suggested that OPEC member nations have economic incentives to exaggerate their reserves , as the OPEC quota system allows greater output for countries with greater reserves . 
 Kuwait , for example , was reported in the January 2006 issue of Petroleum Intelligence Weekly to have only 48 billion barrels ( 7 @.@ 6 × 10 ^ 9 m3 ) in reserve , of which only 24 were fully proven . This report was based on the leak of a confidential document from Kuwait and has not been formally denied by the Kuwaiti authorities . This leaked document is from 2001 , but excludes revisions or discoveries made since then . Additionally , the reported 1 @.@ 5 billion barrels ( 240 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) of oil burned off by Iraqi soldiers in the First Persian Gulf War are conspicuously missing from Kuwait 's figures . 
 On the other hand , investigative journalist Greg Palast argues that oil companies have an interest in making oil look more rare than it is , to justify higher prices . This view is contested by ecological journalist Richard Heinberg . Other analysts argue that oil producing countries understate the extent of their reserves to drive up the price . 
 The EUR reported by the 2000 USGS survey of 2 @,@ 300 billion barrels ( 370 × 10 ^ 9 m3 ) has been criticized for assuming a discovery trend over the next twenty years that would reverse the observed trend of the past 40 years . Their 95 % confidence EUR of 2 @,@ 300 billion barrels ( 370 × 10 ^ 9 m3 ) assumed that discovery levels would stay steady , despite the fact that new @-@ field discovery rates have declined since the 1960s . That trend of falling discoveries has continued in the ten years since the USGS made their assumption . The 2000 USGS is also criticized for other assumptions , as well as assuming 2030 production rates inconsistent with projected reserves . 
 = = = = Reserves of unconventional oil = = = = 
 As conventional oil becomes less available , it can be replaced with production of liquids from unconventional sources such as tight oil , oil sands , ultra @-@ heavy oils , gas @-@ to @-@ liquid technologies , coal @-@ to @-@ liquid technologies , biofuel technologies , and shale oil . In the 2007 and subsequent International Energy Outlook editions , the word " Oil " was replaced with " Liquids " in the chart of world energy consumption . In 2009 biofuels was included in " Liquids " instead of in " Renewables " . The inclusion of natural gas liquids , a bi @-@ product of natural gas extraction , in " Liquids " has been criticized as it is mostly a chemical feedstock which is generally not used as transport fuel . 
 Reserve estimates are based on the oil price . Hence , unconventional sources such as heavy crude oil , oil sands , and oil shale may be included as new techniques reduce the cost of extraction . With rule changes by the SEC , oil companies can now book them as proven reserves after opening a strip mine or thermal facility for extraction . These unconventional sources are more labor and resource intensive to produce , however , requiring extra energy to refine , resulting in higher production costs and up to three times more greenhouse gas emissions per barrel ( or barrel equivalent ) on a " well to tank " basis or 10 to 45 % more on a " well to wheels " basis , which includes the carbon emitted from combustion of the final product . 
 While the energy used , resources needed , and environmental effects of extracting unconventional sources have traditionally been prohibitively high , major unconventional oil sources being considered for large @-@ scale production are the extra heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt of Venezuela , the Athabasca Oil Sands in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin , and the oil shale of the Green River Formation in Colorado , Utah , and Wyoming in the United States . Energy companies such as Syncrude and Suncor have been extracting bitumen for decades but production has increased greatly in recent years with the development of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage and other extraction technologies . 
 Chuck Masters of the USGS estimates that , " Taken together , these resource occurrences , in the Western Hemisphere , are approximately equal to the Identified Reserves of conventional crude oil accredited to the Middle East . " Authorities familiar with the resources believe that the world 's ultimate reserves of unconventional oil are several times as large as those of conventional oil and will be highly profitable for companies as a result of higher prices in the 21st century . In October 2009 , the USGS updated the Orinoco tar sands ( Venezuela ) recoverable " mean value " to 513 billion barrels ( 8 @.@ 16 × 1010 m3 ) , with a 90 % chance of being within the range of 380 @-@ 652 billion barrels ( 103 @.@ 7 × 10 ^ 9 m3 ) , making this area " one of the world 's largest recoverable oil accumulations " . 
 Despite the large quantities of oil available in non @-@ conventional sources , Matthew Simmons argued in 2005 that limitations on production prevent them from becoming an effective substitute for conventional crude oil . Simmons stated " these are high energy intensity projects that can never reach high volumes " to offset significant losses from other sources . Another study claims that even under highly optimistic assumptions , " Canada 's oil sands will not prevent peak oil , " although production could reach 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 bbl / d ( 790 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) by 2030 in a " crash program " development effort . 
 Moreover , oil extracted from these sources typically contains contaminants such as sulfur and heavy metals that are energy @-@ intensive to extract and can leave tailings , ponds containing hydrocarbon sludge , in some cases . The same applies to much of the Middle East 's undeveloped conventional oil reserves , much of which is heavy , viscous , and contaminated with sulfur and metals to the point of being unusable . However , high oil prices make these sources more financially appealing . A study by Wood Mackenzie suggests that by the early 2020s all the world 's extra oil supply is likely to come from unconventional sources .

 The point in time when peak global oil production occurs defines peak oil . Some adherents of ' peak oil ' believe that production capacity will remain the main limitation of supply , and that when production decreases , it will be the main bottleneck to the petroleum supply / demand equation . Others believe that the increasing industrial effort to extract oil will have a negative effect on global economic growth , leading to demand contraction and a price collapse , thereby causing production decline as some unconventional sources become uneconomical . Yet others believe that the peak may be to some extent led by declining demand as new technologies and improving efficiency shift energy usage away from oil . 
 Worldwide oil discoveries have been less than annual production since 1980 . World population has grown faster than oil production . Because of this , oil production per capita peaked in 1979 ( preceded by a plateau during the period of 1973 – 1979 ) . 
 The increasing investment in harder @-@ to @-@ reach oil is a sign of oil companies ' belief in the end of easy oil . Also , while it is widely believed that increased oil prices spur an increase in production , an increasing number of oil industry insiders were reportedly coming to believe that even with higher prices , oil production was unlikely to increase significantly . Among the reasons cited were both geological factors as well as " above ground " factors that are likely to see oil production plateau . 
 An important concept with regard to declining " easy oil " is energy returned on energy invested , also referred to as EROEI . A 2008 Journal of Energy Security analysis of the energy return on drilling effort in the United States concluded that there was extremely limited potential to increase production of both gas and ( especially ) oil . By looking at the historical response of production to variation in drilling effort , the analysis showed very little increase of production attributable to increased drilling . This was because of a tight quantitative relationship of diminishing returns with increasing drilling effort : as drilling effort increased , the energy obtained per active drill rig was reduced according to a severely diminishing power law . The study concluded that even an enormous increase of drilling effort was unlikely to significantly increase oil and gas production in a mature petroleum region such as the United States . However , contrary to the study 's conclusion , since the analysis was published in 2008 , US production of crude oil has increased 74 % , and production of dry natural gas has increased 28 % ( 2014 compared to 2008 ) .

 Average yearly gains in global supply from 1987 to 2005 were 1 @.@ 2 million barrels per day ( 190 × 10 ^ 3 m3 / d ) ( 1 @.@ 7 % ) . In 2005 , the IEA predicted that 2030 production rates would reach 120 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 19 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) , but this number was gradually reduced to 105 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 16 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) . A 2008 analysis of IEA predictions questioned several underlying assumptions and claimed that a 2030 production level of 75 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 11 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) ( comprising 55 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 barrels ( 8 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 m3 ) of crude oil and 20 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 barrels ( 3 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 m3 ) of both non @-@ conventional oil and natural gas liquids ) was more realistic than the IEA numbers . More recently , the EIA 's Annual Energy Outlook 2015 indicated no production peak out to 2040 . However , this required a future Brent crude oil price of $ <unk> / bbl ( 2013 dollars ) " as growing demand leads to the development of more costly resources . " Whether the world economy can grow and maintain demand for such a high oil price remains to be seen . 
 = = = = Oil field decline = = = = 
 In a 2013 study of 733 giant oil fields , only 32 % of the ultimately recoverable oil , condensate and gas remained . <unk> , which is the largest oil field in the world and responsible for approximately half of Saudi Arabia 's oil production over the last 50 years , was in decline before 2009 . The world 's second largest oil field , the Burgan Field in Kuwait , entered decline in November 2005 . 
 It is well established that once an oilfield reaches maximum production , it will decrease at a certain decline rate . For example , Mexico announced that production from its giant <unk> Field began to decline in March 2006 , reportedly at a rate of 13 % per year . Also in 2006 , Saudi Aramco Senior Vice President Abdullah Saif estimated that its existing fields were declining at a rate of 5 % to 12 % per year . According to a study of the largest 811 oilfields conducted in early 2008 by Cambridge Energy Research Associates , the average rate of field decline is 4 @.@ 5 % per year . The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas agreed with their decline rates , but considered the rate of new fields coming online overly optimistic . The IEA stated in November 2008 that an analysis of 800 oilfields showed the decline in oil production to be 6 @.@ 7 % a year for fields past their peak , and that this would grow to 8 @.@ 6 % in 2030 . A more rapid annual rate of decline of 5 @.@ 1 % in 800 of the world 's largest oil fields weighted for production over their whole lives was reported by the International Energy Agency in their World Energy Outlook 2008 . The 2013 study of 733 giant fields mentioned previously had an average decline rate 3 @.@ 83 % which was described as " conservative . " 
 = = = Control over supply = = = 
 Entities such as governments or cartels can reduce supply to the world market by limiting access to the supply through nationalizing oil , cutting back on production , limiting drilling rights , imposing taxes , etc . International sanctions , corruption , and military conflicts can also reduce supply . 
 = = = = Nationalization of oil supplies = = = = 
 Another factor affecting global oil supply is the nationalization of oil reserves by producing nations . The nationalization of oil occurs as countries begin to <unk> oil production and withhold exports . Kate <unk> , Platts ' Middle East editor , points out that while estimates of oil reserves may vary , politics have now entered the equation of oil supply . " Some countries are becoming off limits . Major oil companies operating in Venezuela find themselves in a difficult position because of the growing nationalization of that resource . These countries are now reluctant to share their reserves . " 
 According to consulting firm PFC Energy , only 7 % of the world 's estimated oil and gas reserves are in countries that allow companies like ExxonMobil free rein . Fully 65 % are in the hands of state @-@ owned companies such as Saudi Aramco , with the rest in countries such as Russia and Venezuela , where access by Western European and North American companies is difficult . The PFC study implies political factors are limiting capacity increases in Mexico , Venezuela , Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , and Russia . Saudi Arabia is also limiting capacity expansion , but because of a self @-@ imposed cap , unlike the other countries . As a result of not having access to countries amenable to oil exploration , ExxonMobil is not making nearly the investment in finding new oil that it did in 1981 . 
 = = = = OPEC influence on supply = = = = 
 OPEC is an alliance between 12 diverse oil producing countries ( Algeria , Angola , Ecuador , Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Libya , Nigeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , and Venezuela ) to control the supply of oil . OPEC 's power was consolidated as various countries nationalized their oil holdings , and wrested decision @-@ making away from the " Seven Sisters , " ( Anglo @-@ Iranian , <unk> @-@ Vacuum , Royal Dutch Shell , Gulf , Esso , Texaco , and <unk> ) and created their own oil companies to control the oil . OPEC tries to influence prices by restricting production . It does this by allocating each member country a quota for production . All 12 members agree to keep prices high by producing at lower levels than they otherwise would . There is no way to verify adherence to the quota , so every member faces the same incentive to " cheat " the cartel . United States policy of selling arms and providing security to Saudi Arabia is often seen as an attempt to influence the Saudis to increase oil production . According to sociology professor Michael Schwartz , the purpose for the second Iraq war was to break the back of OPEC and return control of the oil fields to western oil companies . 
 Alternatively , commodities trader Raymond <unk> , author of Over a Barrel : Breaking the Middle East Oil Cartel , contends that OPEC has trained consumers to believe that oil is a much more finite resource than it is . To back his argument , he points to past false alarms and apparent collaboration . He also believes that peak oil analysts are conspiring with OPEC and the oil companies to create a " fabricated drama of peak oil " to drive up oil prices and profits ; oil had risen to a little over $ 30 / barrel at that time . A counter @-@ argument was given in the Huffington Post after he and Steve Andrews , co @-@ founder of ASPO , debated on CNBC in June 2007 . 
 = = Predictions of peak oil = = 
 In 1962 , Hubbert predicted that world oil production would peak at a rate of 12 @.@ 5 billion barrels per year , around the year 2000 . In 1974 , Hubbert predicted that peak oil would occur in 1995 " if current trends continue . " Those predictions proved incorrect . However , a number of industry leaders and analysts believe that world oil production will peak between 2015 and 2030 , with a significant chance that the peak will occur before 2020 . They consider dates after 2030 implausible . By comparison , a 2014 analysis of production and reserve data predicted a peak in oil production about 2035 . Determining a more specific range is difficult due to the lack of certainty over the actual size of world oil reserves . Unconventional oil is not currently predicted to meet the expected shortfall even in a best @-@ case scenario . For unconventional oil to fill the gap without " potentially serious impacts on the global economy " , oil production would have to remain stable after its peak , until 2035 at the earliest . 
 Papers published since 2010 have been relatively pessimistic . A 2010 Kuwait University study predicted production would peak in 2014 . A 2010 Oxford University study predicted that production will peak before 2015 , but its projection of a change soon " ... from a demand @-@ led market to a supply constrained market ... " was incorrect . A 2014 validation of a significant 2004 study in the journal Energy proposed that it is likely that conventional oil production peaked , according to various definitions , between 2005 and 2011 . A set of models published in a 2014 Ph.D. thesis predicted that a 2012 peak would be followed by a drop in oil prices , which in some scenarios could turn into a rapid rise in prices thereafter . According to energy blogger Ron Patterson , the peak of world oil production was probably around 2010 . 
 Major oil companies hit peak production in 2005 . Several sources in 2006 and 2007 predicted that worldwide production was at or past its maximum . Fatih <unk> , chief economist at the International Energy Agency , also stated that " crude oil production for the world has already peaked in 2006 . " However , in 2013 OPEC 's figures showed that world crude oil production and remaining proven reserves were at record highs . According to Matthew Simmons , former Chairman of Simmons & Company International and author of Twilight in the Desert : The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy , " peaking is one of these fuzzy events that you only know clearly when you see it through a rear view mirror , and by then an alternate resolution is generally too late . " 
 = = Possible consequences = = 
 The wide use of fossil fuels has been one of the most important stimuli of economic growth and prosperity since the industrial revolution , allowing humans to participate in takedown , or the consumption of energy at a greater rate than it is being replaced . Some believe that when oil production decreases , human culture , and modern technological society will be forced to change drastically . The impact of peak oil will depend heavily on the rate of decline and the development and adoption of effective alternatives . 
 In 2005 , the United States Department of Energy published a report titled Peaking of World Oil Production : Impacts , Mitigation , & Risk Management . Known as the Hirsch report , it stated , " The peaking of world oil production presents the U.S. and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem . As peaking is approached , liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically , and , without timely mitigation , the economic , social , and political costs will be unprecedented . Viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides , but to have substantial impact , they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking . " Some of the information was updated in 2007 . 
 = = = Oil prices = = = 
 = = = = Historical oil prices = = = = 
 The oil price historically was comparatively low until the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis when it increased more than tenfold during that six @-@ year timeframe . Even though the oil price dropped significantly in the following years , it has never come back to the previous levels . Oil price began to increase again during the 2000s until it hit historical heights of $ 143 per barrel ( 2007 inflation adjusted dollars ) on 30 June 2008 . As these prices were well above those that caused the 1973 and 1979 energy crises , they contributed to fears of an economic recession similar to that of the early 1980s . 
 It is generally agreed that the main reason for the price spike in 2005 – 2008 was strong demand pressure . For example , global consumption of oil rose from 30 billion barrels ( 4 @.@ 8 × 10 ^ 9 m3 ) in 2004 to 31 billion in 2005 . The consumption rates were far above new discoveries in the period , which had fallen to only eight billion barrels of new oil reserves in new accumulations in 2004 . 
 Oil price increases were partially fueled by reports that petroleum production is at or near full capacity . In June 2005 , OPEC stated that they would ' struggle ' to pump enough oil to meet pricing pressures for the fourth quarter of that year . From 2007 to 2008 , the decline in the U.S. dollar against other significant currencies was also considered as a significant reason for the oil price increases , as the dollar lost approximately 14 % of its value against the Euro from May 2007 to May 2008 . 
 Besides supply and demand pressures , at times security related factors may have contributed to increases in prices , including the War on Terror , missile launches in North Korea , the Crisis between Israel and Lebanon , nuclear brinkmanship between the U.S. and Iran , and reports from the U.S. Department of Energy and others showing a decline in petroleum reserves . 
 More recently , between 2011 and 2014 the price of crude oil was relatively stable , fluctuating around $ <unk> per barrel . It dropped sharply in late 2014 to below $ <unk> where it remained for most of 2015 . In early 2016 it traded at a low of $ <unk> . The price drop has been attributed to both oversupply and reduced demand as a result of the slowing global economy , OPEC reluctance to concede market share , and a stronger US dollar . These factors may be exacerbated by a combination of monetary policy and the increased debt of oil producers , who may increase production to maintain liquidity . 
 This price drop has placed many US tight oil producers under considerable financial pressure . As a result , there has been a reduction by oil companies in capital expenditure of over $ <unk> billion . It is anticipated that this will have effects on global production in the longer term , leading to statements of concern by the International Energy Agency that governments should not be complacent about energy security . Energy Information Agency projections anticipate market oversupply and prices below $ <unk> until late 2017 . 
 = = = = Effects of historical oil price rises = = = = 
 In the past , the price of oil has led to economic recessions , such as the 1973 and 1979 energy crises . The effect the price of oil has on an economy is known as a price shock . In many European countries , which have high taxes on fuels , such price shocks could potentially be mitigated somewhat by temporarily or permanently suspending the taxes as fuel costs rise . This method of softening price shocks is less useful in countries with much lower gas taxes , such as the United States . A baseline scenario for a recent IMF paper found oil production growing at 0 @.@ 8 % ( as opposed to a historical average of 1 @.@ 8 % ) would result in a small reduction in economic growth of 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 % . 
 Researchers at the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum found that the economy can adjust to steady , gradual increases in the price of crude better than wild lurches . 
 Some economists predict that a substitution effect will spur demand for alternate energy sources , such as coal or liquefied natural gas . This substitution can be only temporary , as coal and natural gas are finite resources as well . 
 Prior to the run @-@ up in fuel prices , many motorists opted for larger , less fuel @-@ efficient sport utility vehicles and full @-@ sized pickups in the United States , Canada , and other countries . This trend has been reversing because of sustained high prices of fuel . The September 2005 sales data for all vehicle vendors indicated SUV sales dropped while small cars sales increased . Hybrid and diesel vehicles are also gaining in popularity . 
 EIA published Household Vehicles Energy Use : Latest Data and Trends in Nov 2005 illustrating the steady increase in disposable income and $ 20 – 30 per barrel price of oil in 2004 . The report notes " The average household spent $ 1 @,@ 520 on fuel purchases for transport . " According to CNBC that expense climbed to $ 4 @,@ 155 in 2011 . 
 In 2008 , a report by Cambridge Energy Research Associates stated that 2007 had been the year of peak gasoline usage in the United States , and that record energy prices would cause an " enduring shift " in energy consumption practices . The total miles driven in the U.S. peaked in 2006 . 
 The Export Land Model states that after peak oil petroleum exporting countries will be forced to reduce their exports more quickly than their production decreases because of internal demand growth . Countries that rely on imported petroleum will therefore be affected earlier and more dramatically than exporting countries . Mexico is already in this situation . Internal consumption grew by 5 @.@ 9 % in 2006 in the five biggest exporting countries , and their exports declined by over 3 % . It was estimated that by 2010 internal demand would decrease worldwide exports by 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 400 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) . 
 Canadian economist Jeff Rubin has stated that high oil prices are likely to result in increased consumption in developed countries through partial manufacturing de @-@ globalisation of trade . Manufacturing production would move closer to the end consumer to minimise transportation network costs , and therefore a demand decoupling from gross domestic product would occur . Higher oil prices would lead to increased freighting costs and consequently , the manufacturing industry would move back to the developed countries since freight costs would outweigh the current economic wage advantage of developing countries . Economic research carried out by the International Monetary Fund puts overall price elasticity of demand for oil at − 0 @.@ 025 short @-@ term and − 0 @.@ 093 long term . 
 = = = = Agricultural effects and population limits = = = = 
 Since supplies of oil and gas are essential to modern agriculture techniques , a fall in global oil supplies could cause spiking food prices and unprecedented famine in the coming decades . Geologist Dale Allen Pfeiffer contends that current population levels are unsustainable , and that to achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster the United States population would have to be reduced by at least one @-@ third , and world population by two @-@ thirds . 
 The largest consumer of fossil fuels in modern agriculture is ammonia production ( for fertilizer ) via the Haber process , which is essential to high @-@ yielding intensive agriculture . The specific fossil fuel input to fertilizer production is primarily natural gas , to provide hydrogen via steam reforming . Given sufficient supplies of renewable electricity , hydrogen can be generated without fossil fuels using methods such as electrolysis . For example , the Vemork hydroelectric plant in Norway used its surplus electricity output to generate renewable ammonia from 1911 to 1971 . 
 Iceland currently generates ammonia using the electrical output from its hydroelectric and geothermal power plants , because Iceland has those resources in abundance while having no domestic hydrocarbon resources , and a high cost for importing natural gas . 
 = = = Long @-@ term effects on lifestyle = = = 
 A majority of Americans live in suburbs , a type of low @-@ density settlement designed around universal personal automobile use . Commentators such as James Howard Kunstler argue that because over 90 % of transportation in the U.S. relies on oil , the suburbs ' reliance on the automobile is an unsustainable living arrangement . Peak oil would leave many Americans unable to afford petroleum based fuel for their cars , and force them to use bicycles or electric vehicles . Additional options include telecommuting , moving to rural areas , or moving to higher density areas , where walking and public transportation are more viable options . In the latter two cases , suburbs may become the " slums of the future . " The issue of petroleum supply and demand is also a concern for growing cities in developing countries ( where urban areas are expected to absorb most of the world 's projected 2 @.@ 3 billion population increase by 2050 ) . Stressing the energy component of future development plans is seen as an important goal . 
 Rising oil prices , if they occur , would also affect the cost of food , heating , and electricity . A high amount of stress would then be put on current middle to low income families as economies contract from the decline in excess funds , decreasing employment rates . The Hirsch / US DoE Report concludes that " without timely mitigation , world supply / demand balance will be achieved through massive demand destruction ( shortages ) , accompanied by huge oil price increases , both of which would create a long period of significant economic hardship worldwide . " 
 Methods that have been suggested for mitigating these urban and suburban issues include the use of non @-@ petroleum vehicles such as electric cars , battery electric vehicles , transit @-@ oriented development , <unk> cities , bicycles , new trains , new <unk> , smart growth , shared space , urban consolidation , urban villages , and New Urbanism . 
 An extensive 2009 report on the effects of compact development by the United States National Research Council of the Academy of Sciences , commissioned by the United States Congress , stated six main findings . First , that compact development is likely to reduce " Vehicle Miles Traveled " ( <unk> ) throughout the country . Second , that doubling residential density in a given area could reduce <unk> by as much as 25 % if coupled with measures such as increased employment density and improved public transportation . Third , that higher density , mixed @-@ use developments would produce both direct reductions in CO2 emissions ( from less driving ) , and indirect reductions ( such as from lower amounts of materials used per housing unit , higher efficiency climate control , longer vehicle lifespans , and higher efficiency delivery of goods and services ) . Fourth , that although short term reductions in energy use and CO2 emissions would be modest , that these reductions would become more significant over time . Fifth , that a major obstacle to more compact development in the United States is political resistance from local zoning regulators , which would hamper efforts by state and regional governments to participate in land @-@ use planning . Sixth , the committee agreed that changes in development that would alter driving patterns and building efficiency would have various secondary costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify . The report recommends that policies supporting compact development ( and especially its ability to reduce driving , energy use , and CO2 emissions ) should be encouraged . 
 An economic theory that has been proposed as a remedy is the introduction of a steady state economy . Such a system could include a tax shifting from income to depleting natural resources ( and pollution ) , as well as the limitation of advertising that stimulates demand and population growth . It could also include the institution of policies that move away from globalization and toward localization to conserve energy resources , provide local jobs , and maintain local decision @-@ making authority . Zoning policies could be adjusted to promote resource conservation and eliminate sprawl . 
 = = = Mitigation = = = 
 To avoid the serious social and economic implications a global decline in oil production could entail , the Hirsch report emphasized the need to find alternatives , at least ten to twenty years before the peak , and to phase out the use of petroleum over that time . This was similar to a plan proposed for Sweden that same year . Such mitigation could include energy conservation , fuel substitution , and the use of unconventional oil . The timing of mitigation responses is critical . Premature initiation would be undesirable , but if initiated too late could be more costly and have more negative economic consequences . 
 = = = Positive aspects = = = 
 <unk> sees peak oil as holding tremendous potential for positive change , assuming countries act with foresight . The rebuilding of local food networks , energy production , and the general implementation of " energy descent culture " are argued to be ethical responses to the acknowledgment of finite fossil resources . Majorca is an island currently diversifying its energy supply from fossil fuels to alternative sources and looking back at traditional construction and permaculture methods . 
 The Transition Towns movement , started in Totnes , Devon and spread internationally by " The Transition Handbook " ( Rob Hopkins ) and Transition Network , sees the restructuring of society for more local resilience and ecological stewardship as a natural response to the combination of peak oil and climate change . 
 = = Criticisms = = 
 = = = General arguments = = = 
 Opponents to the theory of peak oil often cite new oil reserves that have been found , which continue to forestall a peak oil event . In particular , some contend that oil production from these new oil reserves as well as from existing fields will continue to increase at a rate that outpaces demand , until alternate energy sources for our current fossil fuel dependence are found . As of 2015 , analysts in both the petroleum and financial industries were concluding that the " age of oil " had already reached a new stage where the excess supply that appeared in late 2014 may continue to prevail in the future . A consensus appeared to be emerging that an international agreement will be reached to introduce measures to constrain the combustion of hydrocarbons in an effort to limit global temperature rise to the nominal 2 ° C that is <unk> predicted to limit environmental harm to tolerable levels . 
 Further criticism against peak oil is confidence in the various options and technologies for substituting oil . And indeed there are some promising approaches that seem to have the potential to reduce or even counterbalance the effects of a peak oil situation . For example , US federal funding has increased for algae fuels since the year 2000 due to rising fuel prices . Numerous more projects are being funded in Australia , New Zealand , Europe , the Middle East , and other parts of the world and private companies are entering the field . 
 = = = Oil industry representatives = = = 
 Oil industry representatives have criticised peak oil theory , at least as it has been presented by Matthew Simmons . The president of Royal Dutch Shell 's U.S. operations John Hofmeister , while agreeing that conventional oil production would soon start to decline , criticized Simmons 's analysis for being " overly focused on a single country : Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest exporter and OPEC swing producer . " He also pointed to the large reserves at the US outer continental shelf , which held an estimated 100 billion barrels ( 16 × 10 ^ 9 m3 ) of oil and natural gas . However , only 15 % of those reserves were currently exploitable , a good part of that off the coasts of Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi , and Texas . Hofmeister also contended that Simmons erred in excluding unconventional sources of oil such as the oil sands of Canada , where Shell was active . The Canadian oil sands — a natural combination of sand , water , and oil found largely in Alberta and Saskatchewan — are believed to contain one trillion barrels of oil . Another trillion barrels are also said to be trapped in rocks in Colorado , Utah , and Wyoming , but are in the form of oil shale . These particular reserves present major environmental , social , and economic obstacles to recovery . Hofmeister also claimed that if oil companies were allowed to drill more in the United States enough to produce another 2 million barrels per day ( 320 × 10 ^ 3 m3 / d ) , oil and gas prices would not be as high as they were in the later part of the 2000 to 2010 decade . He thought in 2008 that high energy prices would cause social unrest similar to the 1992 Rodney King riots . 
 In 2009 , Dr. Christoph Rühl , chief economist of BP , argued against the peak oil hypothesis : 
 Physical peak oil , which I have no reason to accept as a valid statement either on theoretical , scientific or ideological grounds , would be insensitive to prices . ... In fact the whole hypothesis of peak oil – which is that there is a certain amount of oil in the ground , consumed at a certain rate , and then it 's finished – does not react to anything ... Therefore there will never be a moment when the world runs out of oil because there will always be a price at which the last drop of oil can clear the market . And you can turn anything into oil into if you are willing to pay the financial and environmental price ... ( Global Warming ) is likely to be more of a natural limit than all these peak oil theories combined . ... Peak oil has been predicted for 150 years . It has never happened , and it will stay this way . 
 According to Rühl , the main limitations for oil availability are " above ground " and are to be found in the availability of staff , expertise , technology , investment security , money and last but not least in global warming . The oil question is about price and not the basic availability . Rühl 's views are shared by Daniel Yergin of CERA , who added that the recent high price phase might add to a future demise of the oil industry , not of complete exhaustion of resources or an apocalyptic shock but the timely and smooth setup of alternatives . 
 Clive Mather , CEO of Shell Canada , said the Earth 's supply of bitumen hydrocarbons is " almost infinite " , referring to hydrocarbons in oil sands .

 Economist Robert L. Bradley , Jr. wrote in a 2007 article in The Review of Austrian Economics that , " [ a ] n Austrian institutional theory is more robust for explaining changes in mineral @-@ resource scarcity than neoclassical <unk> [ . ] " Using the writings of Erich Zimmermann and Julian Simon , Bradley also argued in 2012 that resources have subjective rather than objective existences in economics . He concluded that , " what resources come from the ground ultimately depend on the resources in the mind . " 
 Attorney and mechanical engineer Peter W. Huber pointed out in 2006 that the world is just running out of " cheap oil . " As oil prices rise , unconventional sources become economically viable . He predicted that , " [ t ] he tar sands of Alberta alone contain enough hydrocarbon to fuel the entire planet for over 100 years . " 
 Industry blogger Steve Maley echoed some of the points of Yergin , Rühl , Mather and Hofmeister . 
 Environmental journalist George Monbiot responded to a 2012 report by Leonardo Maugeri by proclaiming that there is more than enough oil ( from unconventional sources ) for capitalism to " deep @-@ fry " the world with climate change . Stephen Sorrell , senior lecturer Science and Technology Policy Research , Sussex Energy Group , and lead author of the <unk> Global Oil Depletion report , and Christophe <unk> , doctoral researcher at the UCL Energy Institute have criticized Maugeri 's assumptions about decline rates .

 = 1990 – 91 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season = 
 The 1990 – 91 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season was fairly quiet , although activity began early and the final named storm formed at a record late date . There were seven named storms classified by the Météo @-@ France office ( MFR ) on Réunion , as well as three depressions ; an additional depression was classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , an unofficial warning agency . The JTWC tracked storms in both September and October , although neither affected land . In late November , another short @-@ lived depression formed in the northeastern portion of the basin . Activity remained minimal until January , when Tropical Storm Alison formed in the eastern portion of the basin . Later in the month , Cyclone Bella became the strongest storm of the season , reaching 10 ‑ minute maximum sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) . It passed near the island of Rodrigues , becoming the worst cyclone there in 20 years and killing half of the population of one endangered species . Bella also likely caused a cargo ship to go missing with 36 people on board . 
 Three storms developed in short succession in the second half of February . Cyclone Cynthia developed rapidly in the Mozambique Channel on February 16 and struck western Madagascar , killing 36 people and ruining local rice harvests . A residual trough after Cynthia dissipated spawned Tropical Storm Debra , which looped in the Mozambique Channel . Toward the end of the month , Tropical Storm Elma exited the basin into the adjacent Australian region , only to re @-@ enter the south @-@ west Indian Ocean and dissipate . Long @-@ lived Cyclone Fatima originated in the Australian basin in late March and changed directions before becoming extratropical . On April 2 , a tropical depression struck eastern Madagascar , killing 18 people . The final storm , Gritelle , was named on June 10 , the latest on record . 
 = = Seasonal summary = = 
 During the season , the Météo @-@ France office ( MFR ) on Réunion island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin . The agency estimated intensity through the Dvorak technique , and warned on tropical cyclones in the region from the coast of Africa to 90 ° E , south of the equator . Beginning in November 1990 , MFR utilized a high resolution picture transmission station in conjunction with its satellite imagery . This allowed for improved Dvorak ratings , allowing for zooming and adjusting the satellite pictures . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , which is a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force task force , also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the southwestern Indian Ocean . In addition to the named storms , the MFR also tracked four tropical depressions , named A1 , A2 , A3 , and G1 . 
 In general , the monsoon was weaker than normal within the basin , which provided less flow across the equator to spawn tropical cyclones . As a result , there was a marked decrease in overall activity compared to the 1989 – 90 season . The MFR issued 198 cyclone bulletins during the season , a 40 % decrease over the previous year . Many of the storms formed at the edge of satellite coverage . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Alison = = = 
 A southward @-@ moving anticyclone influenced the monsoon trough to spawn a tropical disturbance on January 8 , located east of Diego Garcia . The system moved to the east without much organization , turning to the southwest on January 11 around a ridge . On the next day , the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 07S , the same day that the MFR upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Alison . Conditions favored further strengthening , and Alison gradually intensified to peak 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 115 km / h ( 70 mph ) on January 15 , according to the MFR . On the same date , the JTWC assessed peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , equivalent to a minimal hurricane . By that time , the storm had turned more to the south @-@ southeast , and began to weaken on January 16 . Two days later , Alison weakened to tropical depression status and dissipated . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Bella = = = 
 Similar to Alison , Bella originated on January 18 from a surge in the monsoon trough to the southwest of Sumatra . For several days , the system remained weak as it moved generally west @-@ southwestward . On January 25 , it intensified to tropical storm status , but Bella took three more days to intensify to tropical cyclone status , or with 10 ‑ minute maximum sustained winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . The cyclone attained peak intensity on January 29 , officially reaching winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) . The JTWC unofficially estimated winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , the highest the agency estimated for any storm in the Southern Hemisphere in the year . Bella later turned to the southeast and weakened , passing about 50 km ( 30 mi ) west of Rodrigues on January 31 . The storm turned to the south @-@ southwest and back to the southeast again , becoming extratropical on February 4 . 
 While passing near Rodrigues , Bella produced strong winds and high tides , the latter of which caused flooding in the capital Port Mathurin . The storm was considered the worst on the island in 20 years . About 1 @,@ 500 homes were damaged or destroyed , leaving 1 @,@ 000 people homeless . Bella also severely damaged crops , roads , and the power grid on Rodrigues . The storm killed about half of the Rodrigues flying fox , a critically endangered species . Elsewhere , Bella was believed to have sunk a Madagascar cargo ship , with its 36 people on board . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Cynthia = = = 
 For several days beginning on February 9 , an area of convection persisted in the Mozambique Channel off the southeast coast of Mozambique , between the towns of Beira and Quelimane . On February 15 , deep convection increased greatly , leading to a tropical disturbance forming at 06 : 00 UTC the next morning . Also on February 16 , the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 10S . Moving southeastward , the convection quickly organized around the center , aided by warm sea surface temperatures and convergence . Late on February 16 , the system intensified into Tropical Storm Cynthia while it was passing near Juan de Nova Island . Continuing to rapidly intensify , Cynthia attained tropical cyclone status on February 17 , reaching peak winds of 125 km / h ( 75 mph ) . Shortly thereafter , the storm made landfall on western Madagascar just north of Morondava . It rapidly weakened over land as it shifted to the south and later southwest . Early on February 19 , Cynthia emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a tropical disturbance , and the circulation dissipated shortly thereafter . 
 Making landfall in western Madagascar , Cynthia produced peak winds of 157 km / h ( 98 mph ) at Maintirano , with gusts to 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . The city also recorded 420 @.@ 1 mm ( 16 @.@ 54 in ) of rainfall . In some locations , the rainfall from Cynthia was heavier than the average annual precipitation . In some villages , the storm destroyed upwards of 98 % of houses , leaving 125 @,@ 000 people homeless nationwide . The cyclone also wrecked crops and killed livestock , with over 20 @,@ 000 tons of rice destroyed that had been readied for harvest . Cynthia destroyed an irrigation canal in Morondava , flooding 10 @,@ 000 ha ( 25 @,@ 000 acres ) of rice fields . Flooding washed away or heavily damaged several roads and bridges in southwestern Madagascar . The Morondava River , which empties into the Mozambique Channel at Morondava , eroded greatly during the storm . Cynthia killed 36 people , mostly in Toliara . Heavy rains from the storm also spread into Tanzania , causing flooding that destroyed 90 houses and washed away two bridges . 
 Following the storm , the Malagasy government appealed for international aid . In response , the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) provided $ 25 @,@ 000 ( USD ) toward rebuilding damaged roofs and placing a temporary pontoon bridge where a bridge had been washed out . Due to the damaged rice harvest , the Food for Peace program via USAID provided 15 @,@ 000 tons of rice to Madagascar at the cost of $ 7 @.@ 5 million ( USD ) . The French government bought 130 tons of rice seed to be distributed to affected farmers . Local governments in Madagascar provided 6 @,@ 000 farmers with rice seed to replant the ruined crop . In addition , the Swiss government provided money toward a reforestation project to discourage slash @-@ and @-@ burn practices . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Debra = = = 
 After Cynthia dissipated , a residual trough persisted in the Mozambique Channel , spawning a tropical disturbance on February 22 about halfway between Madagascar and Mozambique . The interaction between cool air from the south and warm monsoonal air to the north fueled deep convection . After initially moving to the south , the system turned more to the southwest toward Mozambique on February 24 , developing an eye feature in the center . The JTWC initiated advisories that day as Tropical Cyclone 12S , although the MFR initially maintained the system as a tropical depression . The MFR upgraded the depression to tropical storm status on February 25 , by which time the JTWC already estimated winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . That day , the storm approached the coast of Mozambique within 100 km ( 60 mi ) before turning to the east @-@ northeast . On February 26 , the MFR named the system Debra , and later that day estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 115 km / h ( 70 mph ) . In contrast , the JTWC estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . While moving to the northeast , Debra passed within 200 km ( 125 mi ) of Europa Island on February 27 . The storm subsequently executed a counterclockwise loop to the south , during which it began weakening . By February 28 , Debra had weakened to minimal tropical storm status while accelerating to the southeast , although it briefly re @-@ intensified the next day . On March 4 , an approaching cold front absorbed the storm . 
 While near Europa Island , Debra produced gusts of 63 km / h ( 39 mph ) and sustained winds of 48 km / h ( 30 mph ) . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Elma = = = 
 On February 26 , a tropical disturbance formed in the northeastern portion of the basin , well to the east @-@ southeast of Diego Garcia . It originated from the monsoon trough , and moved generally to the south @-@ southeast while quickly intensifying . Late on February 26 , the MFR upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Elma , around the same time the JTWC began tracking it as Tropical Cyclone 17S . On February 27 , the JTWC estimated Elma attained peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) , before assessing the storm as weakening . In contrast , the MFR estimated <unk> continued to slowly intensify to a 10 ‑ minute peak strength of 105 km / h ( 65 mph ) on March 1 . Shortly thereafter , the storm crossed 90 ° E into the Australian region , where the Bureau of Meteorology estimated that Elma entered at tropical cyclone status . Steady weakening commenced due to the influence of a trough and cooler waters . Elma weakened to the equivalent of tropical depression status by March 3 before turning back to the west . On March 5 , the system recrossed 90 ° E into the south @-@ west Indian Ocean , dissipating shortly thereafter . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Fatima = = = 
 A surge in the monsoon trough spawned what would become Cyclone Fatima to the southwest of Sumatra . On March 21 , the MFR identified a tropical disturbance in the Australian region , which crossed into the south @-@ west Indian Ocean on the next day . Also on March 22 , the MFR upgraded the storm to Tropical Storm Fatima , and the JTWC tracked the system as Tropical Cyclone 17S . The storm moved southwestward due to a ridge to the northwest , and gradually intensified . On March 25 , the JTWC upgraded Fatima to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , although the MFR only estimated 10 ‑ minute winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) at that time . Due to a break in the ridge , Fatima turned toward the south on March 26 , around the time that the JTWC estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . The storm later turned more to the southeast , although it shifted back to the southwest on March 29 . On the next day , the MFR upgraded Fatima to tropical cyclone status and estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) . Fatima turned back to the southeast on March 31 and accelerated , weakening to tropical storm status due to upper @-@ level wind shear . As it was approaching 90 ° E , Fatima became extratropical on April 1 . 
 = = = Tropical Depression G1 = = = 
 On March 30 , an area of convection spawned a small tropical disturbance about 310 km ( 190 mi ) east of Toamasina off the eastern coast of Madagascar . Classified as Tropical Disturbance G1 , the system initially moved to the west @-@ northwest and had poorly @-@ organized convection . On April 1 , the disturbance turned back to the southeast and organized more due to an increase in convection . Later that day it turned back to the west toward Madagascar . On April 2 , the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression , reaching peak winds of 50 km / h ( 30 mph ) . At 09 : 00 UTC that day , the system made landfall about 30 km ( 20 mi ) north of Toamasina . It quickly weakened over land , dissipating on April 3 . 
 The depression brought heavy rainfall to eastern Madagascar that resulted in flooding . <unk> reported 228 @.@ 2 mm ( 8 @.@ 98 in ) of rainfall , as well as wind gusts to 90 km / h ( 56 mph ) . The floods killed 18 people in the country . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Gritelle = = = 
 On June 5 , the near @-@ equator trough spawned a tropical disturbance to the east @-@ southeast of Diego Garcia . The system moved to the southwest and later to the west , influenced by a trough to the south . Initially it failed to intensify much , although an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for development , as did warm water temperatures . On June 7 , the system passed south of the Chagos Archipelago , and on the next day the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 22S , the final of the season . When the system reached the MFR area of satellite coverage on June 10 , it appeared as a well @-@ developed system ; as a result , the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gritelle , estimating peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . On June 11 , Gritelle began weakening due to increased wind shear , deteriorating to tropical depression status on June 12 . Over the subsequent two days , the system executed a loop , maintaining its status as a tropical depression or disturbance . On June 15 , Gritelle passed about 425 km ( 265 mi ) east of Rodrigues while moving to the south . It accelerated to the southeast , dissipating on June 16 . 
 The storm formed was very late in the cyclone season , making Gritelle the strongest June storm in 20 years , as well as the latest in the cyclone year that a storm was properly named . Tropical Depression Fely in 1983 formed later but was wrongly named , and Cyclone Odette in 1971 formed in July when the cyclone year ended on July 31 . The end of the tropical cyclone year shifted from July 31 to June 30 in 2003 . 
 = = = Other storms = = = 
 On September 19 , the JTWC began monitoring a system near the Chagos Archipelago . The system tracked westward , organizing enough that the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 01S on September 21 . Despite predictions that it would strengthen into a tropical storm , the system failed to intensify beyond winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) , and dissipated on September 25 . 
 Similar to the previous system , the JTWC began monitoring a disturbance on October 15 . After an initial movement to the southwest , the system turned to the north and later to the west . The JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 02S on October 18 , estimating peak winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . Two days later , the agency declared the system as dissipated . 
 On November 29 , the JTWC tracked a system to the east @-@ southeast of Diego Garcia , which originated in the monsoon trough . The system moved to the southwest and was classified by MFR as Tropical Disturbance A2 on November 30 . On December 2 , the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression as it curved to the southeast . On that day , the MFR estimated peak winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) , based on the distinct appearance on satellite imagery . On the next day , the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 04S , and assessed the storm as intensifying to a peak of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) ; the intensification was aided by an anticyclone aloft . However , an increase in wind shear caused marked weakening . The JTWC discontinued advisories on December 4 , although the MFR continued tracking the system until December 7 , when the depression had curved back to the southwest for a final time .

 = The finger = 
 In Western culture , the finger or the middle finger ( as in giving someone the ( middle ) finger or the bird or flipping someone off , ) is the most obscene hand gesture . It communicates moderate to extreme contempt , and is roughly equivalent in meaning to " fuck off " , " fuck you " , " shove it up your ass " , " up yours " or " go fuck yourself " . It is performed by showing the back of a hand that has only the middle finger extended upwards , though in some locales the thumb is extended . Extending the finger is considered a symbol of contempt in several cultures , especially in the West . Many cultures use similar gestures to display their disrespect , although others use it to express pointing without intentional disrespect toward other cultures . The gesture is usually used to express contempt but can also be used humorously or playfully . 
 The gesture dates back to Ancient Greece and it was also used in Ancient Rome . Historically , it represented the phallus . In some modern cultures , it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect , and has been used by music artists ( notably more common among hardcore punk bands and rappers ) , actors , celebrities , athletes , and politicians . Most still view the gesture as obscene . The index finger and ring finger besides the middle finger in more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the testicles . 
 = = Origin = = 
 = = = Classical era = = = 
 The middle finger gesture was used in Ancient times as a symbol of sexual intercourse , in a manner meant to degrade , intimidate and threaten the individual receiving the gesture . It also represented the phallus , with the fingers next to the middle finger representing testicles ; from its close association , the gesture may have assumed apotropaic potency . In the 1st @-@ century Mediterranean world , extending the finger was one of many methods used to divert the ever @-@ present threat of the evil eye . 
 In Greek the gesture was known as the <unk> ( <unk> , from kata – κατά , " downwards " and <unk> – <unk> , " rump , buttocks " ) . In ancient Greek comedy , the finger was a gesture of insult toward another person , with the term <unk> also referring to " a male who submits to anal penetration " or <unk> to a female . In Aristophanes 's comedy The Clouds ( 423 BC ) , when the character Socrates is quizzing his student on poetic meters , <unk> declares that he knows quite well what a dactyl is , and gives the finger . The gesture is a visual pun on the two meanings of the Greek word <unk> , both " finger " and the rhythmic measure composed of a long syllable and two short , like the joints of a finger ( — ‿ ‿ , which also appears as a visual pun on the penis and testicles in a medieval Latin text ) . Socrates reacts to the gesture as boorish and childish . The gesture recurs as a form of mockery in Peace , alongside farting in someone 's face ; the usage is later explained in the Suda and included in the Adagia of Erasmus . The verb " to play the <unk> " appears in a fragment of Aristophanes and has a similar meaning ; the usage is once again explained in the Suda , where it is said to mean " to touch the anus with a finger " . Diogenes Laertius records how the Cynic philosopher Diogenes directed the gesture at the orator Demosthenes in 4th @-@ century BC Athens . In the Discourses of Epictetus , Diogenes 's target is instead one of the sophists . 
 In Latin , the middle finger was the <unk> impudicus , meaning the " shameless , indecent or offensive finger " . In the 1st century AD , Persius had superstitious female relatives concoct a charm with the " infamous finger " ( <unk> <unk> ) and " purifying spit " ; while in the Satyricon , an old woman uses dust , spit and her middle finger to mark the forehead before casting a spell . The poet Martial has a character in good health extend " the indecent one " toward three doctors . In another epigram , Martial wrote : " Laugh loud , <unk> , at whoever calls you a <unk> and extend your middle finger . " Juvenal , through synecdoche , has the " middle nail " cocked at threatening Fortuna . The indecent finger features again in a mocking context in the <unk> , a collection of poems relating to the phallic god Priapus . In Late Antiquity , the term " shameless finger " is explained in the <unk> of Isidore of Seville with reference to its frequent use when accusing someone of a " shameful action " .

 Linguist Jesse Sheidlower traces the gesture 's development in the United States to the 1890s . According to anthropologist Desmond Morris , the gesture probably came to the United States via Italian immigrants . The first documented appearance of the finger in the United States was in 1886 , when Old Hoss Radbourn , a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters , was photographed giving it to a member of their rival the New York Giants . In the film Speedy ( 1928 ) , Harold Lloyd 's character gives himself the finger into a distorting mirror at Luna Park , about 24 minutes into the film ; the exact meaning in the film 's context is not clear .

 The gesture has been involved in notable political events . During the USS Pueblo incident , in which an American ship was captured by North Korea , the captured American crewmembers often discreetly gave the finger in staged photo ops , thus ruining the North Koreans ' efforts at propaganda . The North Koreans , ignorant of what the gesture meant , were at first told by the prisoners that it was a " Hawaiian good luck sign " , similar to " hang loose " . When the guards finally figured things out , the crewmembers were subjected to more severe mistreatment . Abbie Hoffman used the gesture at the 1968 Democratic National Convention . Ronald Reagan , while serving as the Governor of California , gave the middle finger to counterculture protestors in Berkeley , California . Nelson Rockefeller , then the Vice President of the United States , directed the gesture to hecklers at a 1976 campaign stop near Binghamton , New York , leading it to be called the " Rockefeller gesture " . Pierre Trudeau , then the Prime Minister of Canada , gave the finger to protesters in Salmon Arm , British Columbia , earning the incident the nickname the " Salmon Arm salute " . The gesture itself has also been nicknamed the " Trudeau salute " . Former president George W. Bush gave the finger to the camera at an Austin production facility during his term as governor of Texas , saying it was " just a one @-@ finger victory salute . " Anthony Weiner gave the finger to reporters after leaving his election headquarters the night he lost the 2013 primary election for Mayor of New York City . 
 During World War II , the 91st Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces referred to the gesture as the " rigid digit " salute . It was used in a more jocular manner , to suggest an airman had committed an error or infraction ; the term was a reference to British slang terms for inattentiveness ( i.e. " pull your finger out ( of your bum ) " ) . The " order of the rigid digit " continued after the war as a series of awards presented by the veteran 's association of the 91st , marked by wooden statuettes of a hand giving the single finger gesture . In 2005 during the war in Iraq , Gunnery Sergeant Michael Burghardt gained prominence when the Omaha World @-@ Herald published a photo of Burghardt making the gesture towards Iraqi insurgents he believed to be watching after an improvised explosive device failed to kill him . 
 The middle finger has been involved in judicial hearings . An appellate court in Hartford , Connecticut ruled in 1976 that gesturing with the middle finger was offensive , but not obscene , after a police officer charged a 16 @-@ year @-@ old with making an obscene gesture when the student gave the officer the middle finger . The case was appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court , which upheld the decision . In March 2006 , a federal lawsuit was filed regarding the free speech issue . 
 Giving the finger has resulted in negative consequences . A Malaysian man was bludgeoned to death after giving the finger to a motorist following a car chase . A Pakistani man was deported by the United Arab Emirates for the gesture , which violates indecency codes . 
 People have given the finger as a method of political protest . At a concert , Ricky Martin gave a picture of George W. Bush the finger to protest the War in Iraq . Serbian protesters gave the finger to the Russian embassy regarding their support of Slobodan Milošević . Artist Ai Weiwei has used the finger in photographs and sculptures as a political statement . As a political message to the Czech President , Czech artist David Cerny floated an outsize , purple statue of a hand on the River Vltava in Prague ; its middle finger extended towards Prague Castle , the Presidential seat .

 The use of the middle finger has become pervasive in popular culture . The band Cobra Starship released a song called " Middle Finger " , and released a music video that showed people giving the finger . Italian artist Maurizio <unk> installed a marble statue of a middle finger measuring 11 metres ( 36 ft ) , located directly in front of the Milan Stock Exchange . A now @-@ famous photograph of Johnny Cash shows him giving the middle finger to a photographer during a 1969 concert at San Quentin State Prison , released as At San Quentin . However , the photo remained fairly obscure until 1998 , when producer Rick Rubin made it the centerpiece of an ad in Billboard criticizing country radio for not giving airplay to Cash 's Grammy @-@ winning album Unchained . Cameron Diaz made the gesture during a photo shoot for Esquire . Harold Lloyd shot the finger to his own reflection in a Coney Island funhouse after getting paint on his suit in Speedy , his final silent feature , from 1928 . 
 Athletes , including Stefan Effenberg , Ron Artest , Luis Suárez , Juan Pablo Montoya , Iván Rodríguez , Danny Graves , Jack McDowell , Natasha <unk> , Josh Smith , Bryan Cox , and Johnny Manziel have been suspended or fined for making the gesture . José Paniagua was released by the Chicago White Sox after giving the middle finger to an umpire ; he hasn 't played in the majors since . Baseball executive Chub Feeney once resigned after giving the finger to fans on Fan Appreciation Night . Bud Adams , owner of the National Football League 's Tennessee Titans , was fined US $ 250 @,@ 000 for giving both middle fingers to the fans of the Buffalo Bills during a game . Professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin is also famous for flashing one or both middle fingers as part of his gimmick . 
 Many musical artists , including Madonna , Lady Gaga , Eminem , Ariana Grande , Katy Perry , and Adele have publicly made the gesture . Britney Spears and Iggy Azalea have given the gesture towards members of the paparazzi , but had to apologize when fans interpreted the gesture as directed at them . M.I.A. gave the gesture during the Super Bowl XLVI Halftime Show . The National Football League , NBC , and M.I.A. apologized . The CD itself for Kid Rock 's album Devil Without a Cause is a picture of his raised middle finger . On the cover of Moby Grape 's first album , Moby Grape , band member Don Stevenson was caught flipping the bird at the camera . The finger was airbrushed out of subsequent releases of the album . 
 In automobile driving culture , giving the finger to a fellow motorist communicates displeasure at another person 's reckless driving habits and / or their disregard for common courtesy . 
 The finger is included in Unicode as U + <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> WITH <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 The media sometimes refers to the gesture as being mistaken for an indication of " we 're number one " , typically indicated with a raised index finger . Sometimes , though , the " mistake " is actually an intentional euphemism meant to indirectly convey the gesture in a medium where a direct description would be inappropriate . For example , Don Meredith is famously noted in a 1972 Monday Night Football game describing the Finger of a dejected Houston Oilers fan as , " He thinks they 're number one in the nation . " Ira Robbins , a law professor , believes the finger is no longer an obscene gesture . Psychologist David Walsh , founder of the National Institute on Media and the Family , sees the growing acceptance of the middle finger as a sign of the growth of a " culture of disrespect " . 
 Google Street View 's picture of the area around the Wisconsin Governor 's Mansion , taken in 2011 , shows a jogger giving the finger in the direction of the mansion . 
 = = Similar gestures = = 
 In the United Kingdom , Ireland , Australia , and New Zealand , the V sign or " the fingers " , when given with back of the hand towards the recipient , serves a similar purpose . George H. W. Bush , former President of the United States , accidentally made the gesture while on a diplomatic trip to Australia . In countries where Spanish , Portuguese , or French are spoken , and especially in Spain , Portugal , Brazil , France the gesture involving raising a fist and slapping the biceps on the same arm as the fist used , sometimes called the Spanish slap , is equivalent to the finger . Italy , Poland , and countries under the influence of Russian culture , such as Russia , Belarus , and Ukraine , also see it as equivalent to the finger , but the majority of young people in these countries use the finger as an insult , which is associated with the Western culture . 
 In Iran and Iraq , a gesture involving exposing only the thumb in a vertical orientation – a thumbs up – is used in lieu of the finger to express roughly the same sentiment . A similarly obscene gesture is extending all five digits with the palm facing forward , meaning " you have five fathers " , thus calling someone a bastard . This is similar to a gesture known in Greece as the <unk> , where the five fingers are spread wide and the palm is pushed towards the recipient . More commonly in Turkish or Slavic regions , the fig sign ( also known as nah or shish ) serves as the equivalent to the finger , meaning " you won 't get it " / " in your dreams " . The gesture is typically made with the hand and fingers curled and the thumb thrust between the middle and index fingers . This gesture is also used similarly in Indonesia , Turkey and China . 
 = Hillforts in Scotland = 
 Hillforts in Scotland are earthworks , sometimes with wooden or stone enclosures , built on higher ground , which usually include a significant settlement , built within the modern boundaries of Scotland . They were first studied in the eighteenth century and the first serious field research was undertaken in the nineteenth century . In the twentieth century there were large numbers of archaeological investigations of specific sites , with an emphasis on establishing a chronology of the forts . Forts have been classified by type and their military and ritual functions have been debated . 
 They were introduced into Scotland during the Bronze Age from around 1000 BCE . The largest group are from the Iron Age , with over 1 @,@ 000 hillforts , mostly below the Clyde @-@ Forth line , most of which were abandoned during the period of Roman occupation of Britain . There are also large numbers of vitrified forts , which have been subjected to fire , many of which may date to this period . After Roman occupation in the early Middle Ages some hillforts were reoccupied and petty kingdoms were often ruled from smaller nucleated forts using defensible natural features , as at Edinburgh and Dunbarton . 
 = = Early studies = = 
 The first major study of Scottish hillforts was undertaken by General William Roy and published as The Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain in 1793 . However , Roy only recorded native forts like Burnswark that had a close relationship to Roman constructions ( in this case probably Roman practice siege camps ) , or which he wrongly attributed to be Roman in origin . George Chalmers ' ( 1742 – 1825 ) first volume of Caledonia ( 1807 ) contained an arbitrary list of forts , but recognised that defences at Burnswark were not just in anticipation of Roman invasion , but to defend against native threats . He also recognised some of the relationships between major and subordinate sites , and the importance of <unk> between sites . In 1851 the Scots @-@ Canadian Daniel Wilson was the first person to use the term " pre @-@ historic " in English , but he was dismissive of the significance of hillforts . The first serious field research in Scotland was undertaken by David Christison , in the decade preceding his Rhind lectures of 1894 . This was the first comprehensive survey of hillforts in a region of Britain . It was critical of previous neglect of the subject and cautious in labelling all forts as prehistoric . His work was published in 1898 as Early Fortification of Scotland and became the model for subsequent national and regional studies . 
 In the twentieth century there were large numbers of archaeological investigations of specific sites , which formed the basis for an attempt to establish a chronology of the forts that would allow them to be fitted into a " defensive sequence " of invasion and occupation . Particularly important in Northern Britain was C. M. Piggott 's investigation at Hownam Rings in the <unk> ( 1948 ) . This established the " Hownam model " for Iron Age forts of progressive complexity of enclosure . These began with simple palisades , developed into stone univallate defences ( with a single rampart ) , then more complex multivallate walls ( with multiple ramparts ) and then finally the abandonment of these defences for stone @-@ built roundhouses attributed to the Pax Romana in the first or second century BCE . This was challenged by Peter Hill on the basis of his excavations at <unk> near Edinburgh , from which he was able to suggest that the chronology of hill fort development was more complex and that stone @-@ build houses pre @-@ dated the arrival of the Romans . The introduction of reliable carbon dating in the late twentieth century allowed new approaches to be developed in which the defensive sequence was less prominent . The idea of developing enclosure , followed by a period of post @-@ enclosure settlement developed in the Hownam model is still seen as having some validity . 
 = = Classification and function = = 
 A. H. A. Hogg identified four types of hillfort : contour forts , promontory forts , cliff forts and ridge forts . Contour forts , where banks and ditches are moulded to the shape of the hill , are the dominant form in Scotland . Less significant are promontory forts , usually employing coastal features , such as the largest one in Scotland at the Mull of Galloway . Different types of defensive style occurred throughout the Iron Age period , some of which may have been a response to Roman siege warfare . There were different combinations in the use of earth , stone or timber . Timber was frequently in @-@ filled with stone or other materials . In continental Europe the timber is often arranged vertically , but in Scotland horizontal timbers were more common . The function of hillforts has been much debated . It was traditionally assumed that they were primarily defensive in nature , but in the late twentieth century this view began to be questioned and social , ritual and religious functions were emphasised . 
 = = Bronze Age = = 
 Bronze working developed in Scotland from about 2000 BCE . As elsewhere in Europe , it was in this period that hillforts of varying size and form were first introduced . Some had timber palisades and others ditches and ramparts . These included the occupation of Eildon hill near Melrose in the Scottish Borders , from around 1000 BCE , which accommodated hundreds of houses on a fortified hilltop . Traprain Law in East Lothian , had a 20 @-@ acre enclosure , sectioned in two places west of the summit , made up of a coursed , stone wall with a rubble core . The occupation of Castle Rock at Edinburgh and Burnswark in Dumfries and Galloway , also date from this time . Additionally , there were much smaller forts that were domestic in scale and which would have housed only one or two families . The function of these forts have been debated , with some stressing their military role and others their importance as symbolic centres of local society . 
 = = Iron Age = = 
 From about 700 BCE iron working reached north Britain . There is evidence for about 1 @,@ 000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland , most located below the Clyde @-@ Forth line . The majority are circular , with a single palisade around an enclosure . They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period , both in the occupied region and further north in the regions beyond Roman control . This may have been because of the threat posed by Roman incursions , which meant that concentrations of military and political force were vulnerable to incursions and siege . Archaeological evidence indicates that some were reoccupied after their departure . 
 There are also numerous vitrified forts , the walls of which have been subjected to fire , which may date to this period , but an accurate chronology has proven to be evasive . When first noted in the nineteenth century it was assumed that vitrification had been deliberately undertaken as part of the building process to harden walls , but this hypothesis was rejected by V. Gordon Childe in the 1940s and subsequent excavations have indicated that , since the debris from such walls fell on the deposits of occupation it could not been part of the building process . Reconstructions have indicated the difficulty of deliberately firing timbers in this way , particularly in the prevailing climatic conditions in Scotland , and it is more likely that this was done as part of a process of fort destruction , either after conquest or when abandoned by the inhabitants . Extensive studies of such a fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus , suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either the last two centuries BCE , or the mid @-@ first millennium CE . Excavations at <unk> , Aberdeenshire indicate a date for its destruction in the period 500 – 250 BCE . 
 = = Early Medieval = = 
 For the period after the departure of the Romans in the fifth century there is evidence of a series of new forts . According to archaeologist Leslie Alcock , warfare was perhaps the " principal social activity in Early Historic northern Britain " , playing a major part in " contemporary prose and poetry " , and for this reason hill forts of this period have been commonly thought of as defensive structures designed to repel attack . Some became the centres of competing kingdoms . These were often smaller " nucleated " constructions compared with those from the Iron Age , sometimes utilising major geographical features , as at Edinburgh , which was probably the main fortification of the Brythonic kingdom of the Gododdin , and Dunbarton rock , who gave its Brythonic name of Alt Clut to the kingdom that dominated the Strathclyde region in the post @-@ Roman period . The northern British peoples utilised different forms of fort and the determining factors in construction were local terrain , building materials , and politico @-@ military needs . The first identifiable king of the Picts , Bridei mac Maelchon ( r. c . 550 @-@ 84 ) had his base at the fort of Craig Phadrig near modern Inverness . The Gaelic overkingdom of Dál Riata was probably ruled from the fortress of Dunadd , now near Kilmartin in Argyll and Bute . 
 = New York State Route 326 = 
 New York State Route 326 ( NY 326 ) is a state highway in Cayuga County , New York , in the United States . NY 326 runs in a southwest to northeast direction from the village of Union Springs to the city of Auburn . The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 90 near the northern village line of Union Springs . Its eastern terminus is at a junction with U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) and NY 5 just west of the Auburn city limits in the town of Aurelius . NY 326 passes through largely rural portions of the Finger Lakes region and does not pass through any built @-@ up areas other than those at each of its termini . 
 NY 326 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York as a connector highway between Union Springs and Auburn . However , its original alignment followed Oakwood Road and Genesee Street from the hamlet of Oakwood to downtown Auburn . It was realigned in the mid @-@ 1970s to end at US 20 and NY 5 west of downtown Auburn . In 1981 , NY 326 was rerouted between the hamlets of Oakwood and Half Acre to follow Half Acre Road . NY 326 's former routing between the two points is now maintained by Cayuga County . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 326 begins at an intersection with NY 90 near the northern village line of Union Springs . The highway heads eastward , following Auburn Street as it runs along the northern village boundary . It briefly parallels a former alignment of itself , now known as " Old Route 326 " , before exiting Union Springs and entering the surrounding town of Springport . Much of Springport , a town situated on the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake , is rural and largely undeveloped . The route passes by houses and fields as it proceeds to a junction known locally as " Powers Corner " . Here , NY 326 turns northeastward and becomes known only by its designation as it heads toward the hamlet of Oakwood . 
 In Oakwood , NY 326 passes several homes and intersects Oakwood Road , a north – south highway linking the community to West Genesee Street in the town of Aurelius to the north . At this junction , NY 326 becomes Half Acre Road , named for the hamlet of Half Acre to the northeast . The highway continues its northeastern track for 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) before turning to the north and entering Half Acre , a small community in Aurelius that is built up around the junction of Half Acre Road and West Genesee Street . Here , NY 326 turns eastward to follow West Genesee Road toward the city of Auburn . It parallels US 20 and NY 5 for 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) to the Veterans Memorial Parkway , which NY 326 turns northward onto . It briefly enters the Auburn city limits but ends at an intersection with US 20 and NY 5 just west of the Auburn city limits in Aurelius . 
 = = History = = 
 NY 326 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and extended from the village of Union Springs to the city of Auburn . The route initially followed Oakwood Road and Genesee Street from the hamlet of Oakwood to Auburn , where it ended at an intersection with NY 34 ( South Street ) in downtown Auburn . A divided highway was built west of Auburn c . 1975 , connecting the overlapping routes of US 20 and NY 5 to NY 326 . US 20 and NY 5 were rerouted to follow the new highway south to NY 326 , and all three routes continued east into downtown on Genesee Street . By 1977 , US 20 and NY 5 were realigned once again to follow a new arterial leading from the north end of the divided highway eastward into downtown . NY 326 , meanwhile , was realigned to follow the divided highway north to US 20 and NY 5 . 
 On April 1 , 1981 , NY 326 was realigned between the hamlets of Oakwood and Half Acre as the result of a highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and Cayuga County . As part of the swap , the state of New York assumed maintenance of Half Acre Road from Oakwood to Half Acre while maintenance of NY 326 's former routing between the two locations was transferred to Cayuga County . The former routing of NY 326 on Oakwood Road is now designated as County Route <unk> ( CR <unk> ) in the town of Aurelius and CR <unk> in the town of Springport . The Genesee Street portion of old NY 326 is now part of CR 1 . In the 1981 maintenance swap , the state of New York also assumed maintenance of the section of Half Acre Road between Half Acre ( at NY 326 ) and the US 20 / NY 5 concurrency . This portion of Half Acre Road is now NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route .

 = Kate Bush = 
 Catherine " Kate " Bush , CBE ( born 30 July 1958 ) is an English singer @-@ songwriter , musician and record producer . She is known for her eclectic and experimental music as well as her idiosyncratic performances . 
 Bush first came to note in 1978 when , at the age of 19 , she topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks with her debut single , " Wuthering Heights " , becoming the first female artist to achieve a UK number @-@ one with a self @-@ written song . She has since released twenty @-@ five UK Top 40 singles , including the top ten hits " The Man with the Child in His Eyes " , " Babooshka " , " Running Up That Hill " , and " King of the Mountain " . She has released ten studio albums , all of which reached the UK Top 10 , including the UK number @-@ one albums , Never for Ever ( 1980 ) and Hounds of Love ( 1985 ) . She is the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at number @-@ one , as well as the first ( and to date , only ) female artist to have top five albums in the UK charts in five successive decades . 
 Bush has been nominated 13 times for British Phonographic Industry accolades , and in 1987 she won a Brit Award for Best British Female Artist . During the course of her career , she has also been nominated for three Grammy Awards . In 2002 , she was recognised with an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music . Bush was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to music . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bush was born in Bexleyheath , Kent , ( now part of the London Borough of Bexley ) to English medical doctor Robert Bush ( 1920 – 2008 ) and Hannah Daly ( 1918 – 1992 ; from County Waterford , Ireland ) . She was raised as a Roman Catholic in their farmhouse in East Wickham with her older brothers , John and Paddy . Bush came from an artistic background : her mother was an accomplished traditional Irish dancer , her father was an accomplished pianist , Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker and John was a poet and photographer . Both brothers were involved in the local folk music scene . 
 John was a karateka at Goldsmiths College karate club and Kate also trained there , becoming known as " Ee @-@ ee " because of her squeaky kiai . One of the instructors , Dave Hazard , later noted in his autobiography that her dance moves seemed to owe something to karate . 
 Her family 's musical influence inspired Bush to teach herself the piano at the age of 11 . She also played the organ in a barn behind her parents ' house and studied the violin . She soon began writing her own tunes and eventually added lyrics to them . 
 = = Musical career = = 
 = = = 1975 – 77 : Beginnings = = = 
 Bush attended St Joseph 's Convent Grammar School , a Catholic girls ' school ( later part of St Mary 's and St Joseph 's School , Sidcup ) , in Woolwich Road , Abbey Wood , south east London , in the mid @-@ 1970s . During this time her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions , which was turned down by record labels . David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper , a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family . Impressed with what he heard , Gilmour helped the sixteen @-@ year @-@ old Bush get a more professional @-@ sounding demo tape recorded that would be more saleable to the record companies . Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour . The tape was produced by Gilmour 's friend Andrew Powell , who would go on to produce Bush 's first two albums , and sound engineer Geoff Emerick . The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater . Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her . The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation . Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity , thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts . 
 Bush was put on retainer for two years by Bob Mercer , managing director of EMI group @-@ repertoire division . According to Mercer he felt Bush 's material was good enough to be released but felt that if the album failed it would be demoralising and if it was successful Bush was too young to handle it . For the first two years of her contract , Bush spent more time on school work than making an album . She left school after doing her mock A @-@ levels and having gained ten GCE O @-@ Level qualifications . In 2005 , Bush stated in an interview with Mark Radcliffe on BBC Radio 2 that she believed EMI signed her before she was ready to make an album so that no other record company could offer her a contract . After the contract signing , EMI forwarded her a sizeable advance which she used to enroll in interpretive dance classes taught by Lindsay Kemp , a former teacher of David Bowie , and mime training with Adam Darius . 
 Bush also wrote and made demos of close to 200 songs , a few of which today can be found on bootleg recordings and are known as the Phoenix Recordings . From March to August 1977 , she fronted the KT Bush Band at public houses around London – specifically at the Rose of Lee public house ( now Dirty South ) in Lewisham . The other three band members were Del Palmer ( bass ) , Brian Bath ( guitar ) , and Vic King ( drums ) . She began recording her first album in August 1977 , although two tracks had been recorded during the summer of 1975 . 
 = = = 1978 – 79 : The Kick Inside and Lionheart = = = 
 As part of her preparation for entering the studio , Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band . However , for her début album , The Kick Inside ( 1978 ) , she was persuaded to use established session musicians , some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board . Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin , unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the <unk> and didgeridoo . Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums . 
 Bush released The Kick Inside when she was 19 years old , but some of the songs had been written when she was as young as 13 . EMI originally wanted the more rock @-@ oriented track " James and the Cold Gun " to be her début single , but Bush insisted that it should be " Wuthering Heights " . Even at this early stage of her career , she had gained a reputation for her determination to have a say in decisions affecting her work . " Wuthering Heights " topped the UK and Australian charts and became an international hit . Bush became the first woman to reach number one in the UK charts with a self @-@ penned song . Despite her considerable subsequent chart success it is still her only No. 1 single ( as of 2015 ) . A second single , " The Man with the Child in His Eyes " , reached number six in the UK charts . It also made it onto the American Billboard Hot 100 where it reached number 85 in early 1979 , and went on to win her an Ivor Novello Award in 1979 for Outstanding British Lyric . 
 Bob Mercer felt that Bush 's relative lack of success in the United States compared to the rest of the world was due to her music being a poor fit for American radio formats , and that there were no outlets for the visual presentation central to Bush 's appeal . EMI capitalised on Bush 's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts . In an interview with NME magazine in 1982 Bush criticised this marketing technique , stating : " People weren 't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano . The media just promoted me as a female body . It 's like I 've had to prove that I 'm an artist in a female body . " In late 1978 , EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow @-@ up album , Lionheart , to take advantage of the success of The Kick Inside . Bush has often expressed dissatisfaction with Lionheart , feeling that she had needed more time to get it right . The album was produced by Andrew Powell , assisted by Bush . While it had spawned several hit singles , most notably " Wow " , it did not garner the same reception as her first album , reaching number six in the UK album charts . 
 Bush was displeased with being rushed into making the second album . She set up her own publishing company , Kate Bush Music , and her own management company , <unk> , to maintain complete control over her work . Members of her family , along with Bush herself , composed the company 's board of directors . Following the album 's release , she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour . The tour , named The Tour of Life , began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks . This live show was co @-@ devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake . Typical of her determination to have creative control , she was involved in every aspect of the production , choreography , set design and staff recruitment for the show . The shows were noted for her dancing , complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show . Because of her intention to dance as she sang , her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the <unk> used a very primitive version in the early 1960s . 
 = = = 1980 – 84 : Never for Ever and The Dreaming = = = 
 Released in September 1980 , Never for Ever saw Bush 's second foray into production , co @-@ producing with Jon Kelly . Her first time as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP , released after her tour the previous year . The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track , with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound . The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse , veering from the straightforward rocker " Violin " to the wistful waltz of hit single " Army Dreamers " . 
 Never for Ever was the first Kate Bush album to feature synthesisers and drum machines , in particular the Fairlight CMI , to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel 's eponymous third album in early 1980 . It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts , also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status , and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top . The top @-@ selling single from the album was " Babooshka " , which reached number five in the UK singles chart . In November 1980 , she released the standalone Christmas single " December Will Be Magic Again " , which reached number 29 in the UK charts . 
 September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming , the first album Bush produced by herself . With her new @-@ found freedom , she experimented with production techniques , creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near @-@ exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI . The Dreaming received a mixed critical reception in the UK , and many were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become " less accessible " . In a 1993 interview with Q ( magazine ) , Bush stated : " That was my ' She 's gone mad ' album . " However , the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart , albeit only reaching number 157 . The album entered the UK album chart at number @-@ three , but is to date her lowest @-@ selling album , garnering only a silver disc . 
 " Sat in Your Lap " was the first single from the album to be released . It pre @-@ dated the album by over a year and peaked at number 11 in the UK . The album 's title track , featuring the talents of Rolf Harris and Percy Edwards , stalled at number 48 , while the third single , " There Goes a Tenner " , stalled at # 93 , despite promotion from EMI and Bush . The track " Suspended in Gaffa " was released as a single in Europe , but not in the UK . 
 Continuing in her storytelling tradition , Bush looked far outside her own personal experience for sources of inspiration . She drew on old crime films for " There Goes a Tenner " , a documentary about the war in Vietnam for " Pull Out the Pin " , and the plight of Indigenous Australians for " The Dreaming " . " Houdini " is about the magician 's death , and " Get Out of My House " was inspired by Stephen King 's novel The Shining . 
 = = = 1985 – 88 : Hounds of Love and The Whole Story = = = 
 Hounds of Love was released in 1985 . Because of the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album , she built a private studio near her home , where she could work at her own pace . Hounds of Love ultimately topped the charts in the UK , knocking Madonna 's Like a Virgin from the number @-@ one position . 
 The album takes advantage of the vinyl and cassette formats with two very different sides . The first side , Hounds of Love , contains five " accessible " pop songs , including the four singles " Running Up that Hill " , " Cloudbusting " , " Hounds of Love " , and " The Big Sky " . " Running Up that Hill " reached number @-@ three in the UK charts and re @-@ introduced Bush to American listeners , climbing to number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1985 . The second side of the album , The Ninth Wave , takes its name from Tennyson 's poem , " Idylls of the King " , about the legendary King Arthur 's reign , and is seven interconnecting songs joined in one continuous piece of music . 
 The album earned Bush nominations for Best Female Solo Artist , Best Album , Best Single , and Best Producer at the 1986 BRIT Awards . In the same year , Bush and Peter Gabriel had a UK Top 10 hit with the duet " Don 't Give Up " ( Dolly Parton , Gabriel 's original choice to sing the female vocal , turned his offer down ) , and EMI released her " greatest hits " album , The Whole Story . Bush provided a new lead vocal and refreshed backing track on " Wuthering Heights , " and recorded a new single , " Experiment IV , " for inclusion on the compilation . Dawn French and Hugh Laurie were among those featured in the video for Experiment IV . At the 1987 BRIT Awards , Bush won the award for Best Female Solo Artist .

One of the quirkiest tracks on the album , touched by Bush 's black humour , is " Heads We 're Dancing " , about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is Adolf Hitler . The title track drew its inspiration from James Joyce 's novel Ulysses . 
 The Sensual World went on to become her biggest @-@ selling album in the US , receiving an RIAA Gold certification four years after its release for 500 @,@ 000 copies sold . In the United Kingdom album charts , it reached the number @-@ two position . 
 In 1990 , the boxed @-@ set This Woman 's Work was released and included all of her albums with their original cover art , as well as two discs of all single B sides recorded from 1978 to 1990 . In 1991 , Bush released a cover of Elton John 's " Rocket Man " , which reached number 12 in the UK singles chart , and went as high as number @-@ two in Australia , and in 2007 , was voted the greatest cover ever by readers of The Observer newspaper . She recorded " Candle in the Wind " , as the single 's b @-@ side . 
 Bush 's seventh studio album , The Red Shoes , was released in November 1993 . The album features more high @-@ profile cameo appearances than her previous efforts , including contributions from composer and conductor Michael Kamen , comedy actor Lenny Henry , Prince , Eric Clapton , Gary Brooker of Procol Harum , Trevor Whittaker , and Jeff Beck . Both The Sensual World and The Red Shoes featured contributions from Trio <unk> , the Bulgarian female vocal trio , who sang on six tracks , including " You 're The One " and " Rocket 's Tail " . The album gave Bush her highest chart position in the US , reaching number 28 , although the only song from the album to make the US singles chart was " Rubberband Girl " , which peaked at number 88 in January 1994 . In the UK , the album reached number @-@ two , and the singles " Rubberband Girl " , " The Red Shoes " , " Moments of Pleasure " , and " And So Is Love " all reached the top 30 . In 1994 , Bush released an accompanying short film , The Line , the Cross & the Curve . Written , directed by , and starring Bush , along with English actress Miranda Richardson , the film was based around the concept of The Red Shoes and featured six of the songs from the album . 
 The initial plan had been to take the songs out on the road , but no new tour transpired . Thus , Bush deliberately aimed for a live @-@ band feel , with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and which would have been too difficult to re @-@ create on stage . The result alienated some of her fan base , who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions , but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed . 
 This period had been a troubled time for Bush . She had suffered a series of <unk> , including the loss of guitarist Alan Murphy , who had started working with her on The Tour of Life in 1979 , and her mother Hannah , to whom she was exceptionally close . Many of the people she lost are honoured in the ballad " Moments of Pleasure . " However , Bush 's mother was still alive when " Moments of Pleasure " was written and recorded . Bush describes playing the song to her mother , who thought the line where she is quoted by Bush as saying , " Every old sock meets an old shoe , " was hilarious and " couldn 't stop laughing . "

 After the release of The Red Shoes , Kate Bush dropped out of the public eye for many years , although her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release . Bush had originally intended to take one year off but despite working on material twelve years passed before her next album release . The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse , sometimes drawing a comparison with Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens 's Great Expectations . In 1998 , Bush had given birth to Albert , known as " Bertie " , fathered by her guitarist and now husband Danny McIntosh . In 2001 , Bush was awarded a Q Award as Classic Songwriter . In 2002 , she was awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music , and performed " Comfortably Numb " at David Gilmour 's concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London . 
 Kate Bush 's eighth studio album , Aerial , was released on double CD and vinyl in November 2005 . The first single from the album was " King of the Mountain " , which was played for the first time on BBC Radio 2 on 21 September 2005 . 
 As on Hounds of Love ( 1985 ) , the album is divided into two sections , each with its own theme and mood . The first disc , subtitled A Sea of Honey , features a set of unrelated themed songs , including " King of the Mountain " ; " Bertie " , a Renaissance @-@ style ode to her son ; and " <unk> " , based on the story of Joan of Arc . In the song " <formula> " , Bush sings 117 digits of the number Pi , but misses 22 digits from the 80th to the 101st place of the value of pi . The second disc , subtitled A Sky of Honey , features one continuous piece of music describing the experience of being outdoors after waking at dawn , moving through afternoon , dusk , to night , then back to the following dawn of single summer 's day . All the pieces in this suite refer or allude to sky and sea in their lyrical content . Bush mixed her voice with cooing <unk> to repeat the phrases " A sea of honey , a sky of honey , " and " You 're full of beauty " throughout the piece , and uses recordings of actual birdsong throughout . A Sky of Honey features Rolf Harris playing the didgeridoo on one track , and providing vocals on " The Painter 's Link " . Other artists making guest appearances on the album include Peter Erskine , Eberhard Weber , Lol Creme , and Gary Brooker . Two tracks feature string arrangements by Michael Kamen , performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra . A CD release of the single " King of the Mountain " included a cover of " Sexual Healing " by Marvin Gaye . 
 " King of the Mountain " entered the UK Downloads Chart at number @-@ six on 17 October 2005 , and by 30 October it had become Bush 's third @-@ highest @-@ charting single ever in the UK , peaking at number @-@ four on the full chart . Aerial entered the UK albums chart at number @-@ three , and the US chart at number 48 . Bush herself carried out relatively little publicity for the album , only conducting a handful of magazine and radio interviews . Aerial earned Bush two nominations at the 2006 BRIT Awards , for Best British Female Solo Artist and Best British Album . 
 In late 2007 , Bush composed and recorded a new song , " Lyra " , for the soundtrack to the fantasy film The Golden Compass . 
 = = = 2011 @-@ 12 : Director 's Cut and 50 Words for Snow = = = 
 On 16 May 2011 , Bush released the album , Director 's Cut . The album , which Bush has described as an entirely new project rather than a collection of mere remixes , contains 11 tracks of substantially reworked material from her earlier albums , The Sensual World and The Red Shoes , all of which have been recorded using analogue , rather than digital , equipment to create " a warmer sound " . All the tracks have new lead vocals , new drums , and radically reworked instrumentation . Some of them have been transposed to a lower key to accommodate her lowering voice . Three of the songs , including " This Woman 's Work " , have been completely re @-@ recorded , with lyrics often changed in places . The album has been met with a wide range of reviews with most reviewers a bit confused about the concept of the album itself , while responding with varying degrees of enthusiasm about its revamped tracks . Of particular note is the warmer , more intimate tone of the songs and the richer , more mature sound of her voice . This is the first album on her new label , Fish People , a division of EMI Records , with whom she 's had a relationship since she started recording . In addition to the album , Director 's Cut in both its single CD form and in a box @-@ set with The Sensual World and the analogue re @-@ mastered The Red Shoes , Fish People will be releasing re @-@ mastered editions of The Hounds of Love and The Dreaming . The album debuted at number @-@ two on the United Kingdom chart . 
 The song " The Sensual World " has been renamed " Flower of the Mountain " and contains a passage of Molly Bloom 's famous soliloquy from James Joyce 's novel Ulysses . Bush said , " Originally when I wrote the song ' The Sensual World ' , I had used text from the end of Ulysses . When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused , which was disappointing . I then wrote my own lyrics for the song , although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting . Well , I 'm not James Joyce am I ? When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes . " 
 The first single released from the album was " Deeper Understanding " and contains a new chorus featuring computerised vocals from Bush 's son , Albert . A video for the song , directed by Bush , has been released through her channel on YouTube . It features Robbie Coltrane as a man consumed by his relationship with his computer ( voiced by Bush 's son ) . Frances Barber plays the man 's wife , and Noel Fielding also appears . 
 Bush 's next studio album , 50 Words for Snow , was released on 21 November 2011 . The album contains seven new songs " set against a backdrop of falling snow , " with a total running time of 65 minutes . A radio edit of the first single , " Wild Man , " was played on BBC Radio 2 's The Ken Bruce Show on 10 October. and was released as a digital download on 11 October . The album is distributed in the United States by Anti @-@ Records . 
 On 14 November 2011 , NPR played 50 Words for Snow in its entirety for the first time . Australia 's ABC Radio National declared 50 Words for Snow album of the week of 12 November 2011 . 
 The album 's songs are built around Bush 's quietly jazzy piano and Steve Gadd 's drums , and utilise both sung and spoken word vocals in what Classic Rock critic Stephen Dalton calls " a ... supple and experimental affair , with a contemporary chamber pop sound grounded in crisp piano , minimal percussion and light @-@ touch electronics ... billowing jazz @-@ rock soundscapes , interwoven with fragmentary narratives delivered in a range of voices from shrill to Laurie Anderson @-@ style cooing . " Bassist Danny Thompson appears on the album , which also features performances by Elton John and actor Stephen Fry . 
 On the first track , " Snowflake , " in a song written specifically to use his still high choir @-@ boy voice , Bush 's son Albert ( Bertie ) sings the role of a falling snowflake in a song expressing the hope of a noisy world soon being hushed by snowfall . " Snowflake " drifts into " Lake Tahoe " , where choral singer Stefan Roberts and Bush sing about a rarely seen ghost : a woman who appears in a Victorian gown to call to her dog , Snowflake . Bush explained to fellow musician Jamie Cullum in an interview on Dutch Radio that she wished to explore using high male voices in contrast to her own , deeper , voice . " Misty " is about a snowman lover who melts away after a night of passion , while " Wild Man " tells the story of a group of climbers in the Himalayas who , upon finding evidence of a nearby Yeti , erase all traces of it to protect it from discovery . Elton John and Bush as eternally divided lovers trade vocals on " Snowed in at Wheeler Street " , while Stephen Fry recites the " 50 Words for Snow " . The quiet " Among Angels " finishes the album . 
 50 Words for Snow received general acclaim from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 88 , based on 26 reviews , which indicates " universal acclaim " . She was nominated for a Brit Award in the " Best Female Artist " category , and the album won the 2012 Best Album at the South Bank Arts Awards , and was also nominated for Best Album at the Ivor Novello Awards .

 Bush turned down an invitation by the organisers of the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony to perform at the event . Instead a recording of a new remix of her 1985 hit " Running Up that Hill " was played at the end of the ceremony . Bush released an exclusive limited @-@ edition 10 " picture disc of the 2012 remix as part of Record Store Day 2013 on 20 April 2013 . 
 In March 2014 , Bush announced her first live concerts in several decades : a 22 @-@ night residency called Before the Dawn in London from 26 August – 1 October 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo . Tickets sold out in 15 minutes . The concerts received positive reviews . In August 2014 , bolstered by the publicity around her upcoming performances , she became the first female performer to have eight albums in the Official UK Top 40 Albums Chart simultaneously , putting her at number three for simultaneous UK Top 40 albums ( behind Elvis Presley with 12 albums in 1977 , and The Beatles in 2009 with 11 albums ) ; altogether she had 11 albums in the top 50 . 
 = = Artistry = = 
 Bush 's musical aesthetic is eclectic , and is known to employ varied influences and meld disparate styles , often within a single song or over the course of an album . Even in her earliest works , with piano the primary instrument , she wove together many diverse influences , drawing on classical music , glam rock , and a wide range of ethnic and folk sources . This would continue throughout her career . By the time of Never for Ever , Bush had begun to make prominent use of the Fairlight CMI synthesizer , which allowed her to sample and manipulate sounds , expanding her sonic palette . Her career output has been variously categorized as art rock , art pop , baroque pop , experimental pop , and pop rock . She has been compared with other " ' arty ' 1970s and ' 80s British pop rock artists " such as Roxy Music and Peter Gabriel . 
 Bush has a soprano vocal range . Her vocals contain elements of British , Anglo @-@ Irish and most prominently ( southern ) English accents and , in its utilisation of musical instruments from many periods and cultures , her music has differed from American pop norms . Elements of Bush 's lyrics often employ historical or literary references , as embodied in her first single " Wuthering Heights , " which is based on Emily Brontë 's novel of the same name . She has described herself as a storyteller who embodies the character singing the song and has dismissed efforts by others to conceive of her work as autobiographical . Bush 's lyrics have been known to touch on obscure or esoteric subject matter , and New Musical Express noted that Bush was not afraid to tackle sensitive and taboo subjects in her work . " The Kick Inside " is based on a traditional English folk song ( The Ballad of Lucy Wan ) about an incestuous pregnancy and a resulting suicide . " <unk> from Baghdad " is a song about a homosexual male couple ; Out magazine listed two of her albums in their " Top 100 Greatest <unk> Albums " list . She has referenced G. I. Gurdjieff in the song " Them Heavy People " , while " Cloudbusting " was inspired by Peter Reich 's autobiography , A Book of Dreams , about his relationship with his father , Wilhelm Reich . " The Infant Kiss " is a song about a haunted , unstable woman 's almost <unk> infatuation with a young boy in her care ( inspired by Jack Clayton 's film The Innocents ( 1961 ) , which had been based on Henry James 's famous novella The Turn of the Screw ) ; and " Breathing " explores the results of nuclear fallout from the perspective of a fetus . 
 Other non @-@ musical sources of inspiration for Bush include horror films , which have influenced the gothic nature of several of her songs , such as " Hounds of Love " , which samples the 1957 horror movie Night of the Demon . Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour , such as murder by poisoning in " Coffee <unk> " , an alcoholic mother in " Ran Tan Waltz " and the upbeat " The Wedding List " , a song inspired by François Truffaut 's 1967 film of Cornell Woolrich 's The Bride Wore Black about the death of a groom and the bride 's subsequent revenge against the killer . Bush has also cited comedy as a significant influence . She has cited Woody Allen , Monty Python , Fawlty Towers , and The Young Ones as particular favourites . 
 Reviewers have used the term " surreal " to describe her music . Many of her songs explore melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy categorisation . It has been observed that even her more joyous pieces are often tinged with traces of melancholy , and even the most sorrowful pieces have elements of vitality struggling against all that would oppress them . 
 = = Duration between album releases and media rumours = = 
 The length of time between album releases has led to rumours in the media concerning her health or appearance . In the past , stories of weight gain or mental instability have been disproved by Bush 's periodic reappearance . In 2011 Bush told BBC Radio 4 that the amount of time between album releases is extremely stressful noting : " It 's very frustrating the albums take as long as they do ... I wish there weren 't such big gaps between them . " In the same interview Bush denied she was a perfectionist in the studio , saying : " I think it 's important that things are flawed ... That 's what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes – the bit that 's wrong or the mistake you 've made that 's led onto an idea you wouldn 't have had otherwise , " and reiterated her prioritisation of her family life . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 Bush 's first tour took place 2 April – 13 May 1979 ; 35 years later she embarked on a series of 22 concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo , beginning 26 August 2014 . Apart from these two concert series , she has only given occasional live performances . Several reasons have been suggested as to why she abandoned touring , among them her reputed need to be in total control of the final product , which is incompatible with live stage performance , a rumour of a crippling fear of flying , and the suggestion that the death of 21 @-@ year @-@ old Bill Duffield severely affected her . Duffield , her lighting engineer , was killed in an accident during her concert of 2 April 1979 at Poole Arts Centre . Bush held a benefit concert on 12 May 1979 , with Peter Gabriel and Steve Harley at London 's Hammersmith Odeon for his family . Duffield would be honoured in two later songs : " Blow Away " on Never for Ever and " Moments of Pleasure " on The Red Shoes . Bush explained in a BBC Radio 2 interview with Mark Radcliffe that she actually enjoyed the tour but was consumed with producing her subsequent records . A BBC film crew followed the preparation for the tour which was shown on the BBC Nationwide program as a 30 @-@ minute special . 
 During the same period as her tour , she made numerous television appearances around the world , including Top of the Pops in the United Kingdom , <unk> Bahnhof in Germany , and Saturday Night Live in the United States ( with Paul Shaffer on piano ) <unk> only appearance on American television to date . On 28 December 1979 , BBC TV aired the Kate Bush Christmas Special . It was recorded in October 1979 at the BBC Studios in Birmingham , England ; choreography by Anthony Van <unk> . As well as playing songs from her first two albums , she played " December Will Be Magic Again " , " Violin " , " The Wedding List " , " Ran Tan Waltz " and " Egypt " from her forthcoming album , Never for Ever . Peter Gabriel made a guest appearance to play " Here Comes the Flood " , and a duet of Roy Harper 's " Another Day " with Bush . 
 After the Tour of Life , Bush desired to make two more albums before touring again . At that point , she got involved with production techniques and sound experimentation that took up a lot of time and prevented her from touring . She came close to touring again following the release of The Dreaming and The Red Shoes , but live shows never materialised . 
 In 1982 , Bush participated in the first benefit concert in aid of The Prince 's Trust alongside artists such as Madness , Midge Ure , Phil Collins , Mick Karn and Pete Townshend . On 25 April 1986 Bush performed live for British charity event Comic Relief , singing " Do Bears ... ? " , a humorous duet with Rowan Atkinson , and a rendition of " Breathing " . In March 1987 , Bush sang " Running Up That Hill " at The Secret Policeman 's Third Ball accompanied by David Gilmour . On 28 June 1987 , she made a guest appearance to duet with Peter Gabriel on " Don 't Give Up " at Earl 's Court , London as part of his So tour . 
 On 17 January 2002 , Bush appeared with her long @-@ time champion , David Gilmour , singing the part of the doctor in " Comfortably Numb " at the Royal Festival Hall in London . 
 In 2011 , Bush told the magazine Classic Rock : " I do hope that some time I get a chance to do some shows . Maybe not a tour , but something . " 
 In March 2014 , Bush announced a 22 @-@ night residency called Before the Dawn in London from 26 August – 1 October 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo . The BBC reviewed the concert positively . The set list comprised most of Hounds of Love featuring the entire Ninth Wave suite , most of Aerial including the entire second disc , two songs from The Red Shoes , and one song from 50 Words for Snow . Bush 's first four albums and The Sensual World were noticeably excluded from the set list .

Early 1978 the amusement parks Haunted Castle was completed and the opening was scheduled on 10 May that year .

Her voice , the imagery , the huge drum sound : it seemed to capture everything for me . As a songwriter you 're constantly chasing that feeling " . Rufus Wainwright named Bush as one of his top ten gay icons . Outside music , Bush has been an inspiration to several fashion designers , including Hussein Chalayan .

 Bush is married to guitarist Dan McIntosh and they have a son , Albert , born 1998 , known as Bertie . Bertie featured prominently in the 2014 concert , " Before the Dawn " . She previously had a long @-@ term relationship with Del Palmer . 
 Bush is a former resident of Eltham , southeast London . In the 1990s , she moved to a canalside residence in Sulhamstead , Berkshire , and subsequently moved to Devon in 2004 . Bush is a vegetarian . 
 Raised a Roman Catholic , she said in 1999 : 
 I was a Roman Catholic and brought up in Roman Catholic schools . I would never say I was a strict follower of Roman Catholic belief , but a lot of images are in there ; they have to be ; they 're so strong . Such powerful , beautiful , passionate images ! There 's a lot of suffering in Roman Catholicism . I think I 'm looking for not necessarily religion , but ways of helping myself to become more understanding , more complete , a happier person — what we all want in life . But I really don 't think I 've found a niche .

 = Richmond Park = 
 Richmond Park , in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames , was created by Charles I in the 17th century as a deer park . The largest of London 's Royal Parks , it is of national and international importance for wildlife conservation . The park is a national nature reserve , a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation and is included , at Grade I , on Historic England 's Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England . Its landscapes have inspired many famous artists and it has been a location for several films and TV series . 
 Richmond Park includes many buildings of architectural or historic interest . The Grade I @-@ listed White Lodge was formerly a royal residence and is now home to the Royal Ballet School . The park 's boundary walls and ten other buildings are listed at Grade II , including Pembroke Lodge , the home of 19th @-@ century British Prime Minister Lord John Russell and his grandson , the philosopher Bertrand Russell . 
 Historically the preserve of the monarch , the park is now open for all to use and includes a golf course and other facilities for sport and recreation . It played an important role in both world wars and in the 1948 and 2012 Olympics .

 Richmond Park is the largest of London 's Royal Parks . It is the second @-@ largest park in London ( after the 10 @,@ 000 acre Lee Valley Park , whose area extends beyond the M25 into Hertfordshire and Essex ) and is Britain 's second @-@ largest urban walled park after Sutton Park , Birmingham . Measuring 3 @.@ 69 square miles ( 955 hectares or 2 @,@ 360 acres ) , it is comparable in size to Paris 's Bois de Vincennes ( 995 ha or 2 @,@ 458 ac ) and Bois de Boulogne ( 846 ha or 2 @,@ 090 ac ) . It is almost half the size of Casa de Campo ( Madrid ) ( 1750 ha or <unk> @.@ 34 ac ) and around three times the size of Central Park in New York ( 341 ha or 843 ac ) .

 Of national and international importance for wildlife conservation , most of Richmond Park ( 856 hectares ) is a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) , a National Nature Reserve ( NNR ) and Special Area of Conservation ( SAC ) . The largest Site of Special Scientific Interest in London , it was designated as an SSSI in 1992 , excluding the area of the golf course , Pembroke Lodge Gardens and the Gate Gardens . In its citation , Natural England said : " Richmond Park has been managed as a royal deer park since the seventeenth century , producing a range of habitats of value to wildlife . In particular , Richmond Park is of importance for its diverse deadwood beetle fauna associated with the ancient trees found throughout the parkland . In addition the park supports the most extensive area of dry acid grassland in Greater London . " 
 The park was designated as an SAC in April 2005 on account of its having " a large number of ancient trees with decaying timber . It is at the heart of the south London centre of distribution for stag beetle <unk> <unk> , and is a site of national importance for the conservation of the fauna of invertebrates associated with the decaying timber of ancient trees " . 
 Since October 1987 the park has also been included , at Grade I , on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England , being described in Historic England 's listing as " A royal deer park with pre C15 origins , <unk> by Charles I and improved by subsequent monarchs . A public open space since the mid C19 " .

 The Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport manages Richmond Park and the other Royal Parks of London under powers set out in the Crown Lands Act 1851 , which transferred management of the parks from the monarch to the government . Day @-@ to @-@ day management of the Royal Parks has been delegated to The Royal Parks , an executive agency of the Department for Culture , Media and Sport ( DCMS ) . The Royal Parks ' Board sets the strategic direction for the agency . Appointments to the Board are made by the Mayor of London . 
 The Friends of Richmond Park and the Friends of Bushy Park co @-@ chair the Richmond and Bushy Parks Forum , comprising 38 local groups of local stakeholder organisations . The forum was formed in September 2010 to consider proposals to bring Richmond Park and Bushy Park – and London 's other royal parks – under the control of the Mayor of London through a new Royal Parks Board and to make a joint response . Although welcoming the principles of the new governance arrangements , the forum ( in 2011 ) and the Friends of Richmond Park ( in 2012 ) have expressed concerns about the composition of the new board . 
 = = = Access = = = 
 Richmond Park is enclosed by a high wall with several gates . The gates either allow pedestrian and bicycle access only , or allow bicycle , pedestrian and other vehicle access . The gates for motor vehicle access are open only during daylight hours , and the speed limit is 20 mph . Apart from taxis , no commercial vehicles are allowed unless they are being used to transact business with residents of the park . 
 From Easter until the end of August 2015 , a free bus service runs on Wednesdays , stopping at the main car parks and the gate at Isabella Plantation nearest Peg 's Pond . 
 The gates open to motor traffic are : Sheen Gate , Richmond Gate , Ham Gate , Kingston Gate , Roehampton Gate and ( for access to Richmond Park Golf Course only ) Chohole Gate . There is pedestrian and bicycle access to the park 24 hours a day except during the deer cull in February and November when the pedestrian gates are closed between 8 : 00 pm and 7 : 30 am . 
 The Beverley Brook Walk runs through the park between Roehampton Gate and Robin Hood Gate . The Capital Ring walking route passes through the park from Robin Hood Gate to Petersham Gate . The Thames Cycle Route runs across the park from Ham Gate to Roehampton Gate . London Cycle Network route no . 3 goes through the park . 
 The park has designated bridleways and cycle paths . These are shown on maps and <unk> displayed near the main entrances , along with other regulations that govern use of the park . The bridleways are special in that they are for horses ( and their riders ) only and not open to other users like normal bridleways . Cycling is allowed only on main roads and on the Tamsin Trail ( the shared @-@ use pedestrian cycle path that runs close to the park 's perimeter ) . 
 As the park is a national nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest , all dog owners are required to keep their dogs under control while in the park . This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife . In 2009 , after some incidents leading to the death of wildfowl , the park 's dogs on leads policy was extended . Park users are said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park and Royal Parks advises against walking dogs in the park during the deer 's birthing season . 
 = = = Law enforcement = = = 
 A mugging at gunpoint in 1854 reputedly led to the establishment of a park police force . Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police . The mounted police have been replaced by a patrol team in a four @-@ wheel drive vehicle . In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in the park to half the level that they were ten years previously , despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime . 
 In July 2012 it was reported that police have been given the power to issue £ 50 on @-@ the @-@ spot fines for littering , cycling outside designated areas and for dog fouling offences . In August 2012 a dog owner was ordered to pay £ 315 after allowing five dogs to chase ducks in the park . Since 2013 commercial dog @-@ walkers have been required to apply for licences to walk dogs in the park and are allowed to walk only four dogs at a time . In September 2013 a cyclist was successfully prosecuted for speeding at 37 mph in the park . In March 2015 a cycling club member was fined for speeding at 41 mph and faced disciplinary action from his cycling club , which uses the park for training . In 2014 and 2015 two men were prosecuted for picking mushrooms in the park .

 Cycling : Cycles are available for hire near Roehampton Gate and , at peak times , near Pembroke Lodge . The Tamsin Trail ( shared between pedestrians and cyclists ) provides a circuit of the park and is almost entirely car @-@ free . 
 Fishing is allowed , by paid permit , on Pen Ponds from mid @-@ June to mid @-@ March . 
 Golf is played at Richmond Park Golf Course , accessed from Chohole Gate . 
 Horse riding : Horses from several local stables are ridden in the park . 
 Rugby : A section of the grassland to the north of the Roehampton Gate is maintained and laid out during the winter months for rugby ; there are three pitches . At weekends , this area is hired extensively to Rosslyn Park Rugby Football Club . The club buses visiting teams to and from the park pitches from its nearby clubhouse and changing rooms . 
 Running : The Tamsin Trail is a 7 @.@ 2 miles ( 11 @.@ 6 km ) trail around the park which is popular with runners . Members of Barnes Runners complete at least one circumnavigation of it on the first and third Sunday of every month . The Richmond Park <unk> , a 5 km organised run , takes place every Saturday at 9 : 00 a.m. from a starting point close to Bishop 's Gate . 
 There are children 's playgrounds at Kingston Gate and Petersham Gate .

 The Friends of Richmond Park ( FRP ) was founded in 1961 to protect the park . In 1960 the speed limit in the park had been raised from 20 to 30 miles an hour and there were concerns that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of Hyde Park . In 1969 , plans by the then Greater London Council to assign the park 's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn . The speed limit was reduced to 20 miles an hour in the summer of 2004 . 
 In 2011 , the Friends successfully campaigned for the withdrawal of plans for open air screenings of films in the park . In 2012 , the Friends contributed towards the cost of a new Jubilee Pond , and launched a public appeal for a Ponds and Streams Conservation Programme in which the Friends , the Richmond Park Wildlife Group and Healthy Planet have been working with staff from The Royal Parks to restore some of the streams and ponds in the park . 
 The Friends run a visitor centre near Pembroke Lodge , organise a programme of walks and education activities for young people , and produce a quarterly newsletter . The Friends have published two books , A Guide to Richmond Park and Family Trails in Richmond Park ; profits from the books ' sales contribute towards the Friends ' conservation work . 
 The Friends of Richmond Park has been a charitable organisation since 2009 . It has 2200 members , is run by approximately 150 volunteers and has no staff . Broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough , former Richmond Park MP Baroness Susan Kramer and children 's author Dame Jacqueline Wilson are patrons of FRP . The chair ( in 2015 ) is Ron Crompton , who also chairs the Royal Parks Friends Forum . The Friends Forum enables the chairs of all the Royal Parks Friends groups to meet regularly to discuss common issues and to make their views known to the chief executive of the Royal Parks , the Royal Parks Advisory Group and the Department of Culture , Media and Sport .

 In 1625 Charles I brought his court to Richmond Palace to escape an outbreak of plague in London and turned the area on the hill above Richmond into a park for the hunting of red and fallow deer . It was originally referred to as the king 's " New Park " to distinguish it from the existing park in Richmond , which is now known as Old Deer Park . In 1637 he appointed Jerome Weston , 2nd Earl of Portland as keeper of the new park for life , with a fee of 12 ( old ) pence a day , pasture for four horses , and the use of the brushwood . – later holders of that office were known as " Ranger " . Charles 's decision , also in 1637 , to enclose the land was not popular with the local residents , but he did allow pedestrians the right of way . To this day the walls remain , although they have been partially rebuilt and reinforced . Following Charles I 's execution , custodianship of the park passed to the Corporation of the City of London . It was returned to the restored monarch , Charles II , on his return to London in 1660 . 
 = = = Georgian alterations = = = 
 In 1719 Caroline of Ansbach and her husband , the future George II of Great Britain , bought Richmond Lodge as a country residence . This building had first been built as a hunting lodge for James I in 1619 and had also been occupied by William III . As shown in a map of 1734 , Richmond Park and Richmond Gardens then formed a single unit – the latter was merged with Kew Gardens by George III in the early 1800s . In 1736 the Queen 's Ride was cut through existing woodland to create a grand avenue through the park and Bog Gate or Queen 's Gate was opened as a private entrance for Caroline to enter the park on her journeys between White Lodge and Richmond Lodge . The same map shows Pen Ponds , a lake divided in two by a causeway , dug in 1746 and initially referred to as the Canals , which is now a good place to see water birds . Richmond Lodge fell out of use on Caroline 's death in 1737 but was brought back into use by her grandson George III as his summer residence from 1764 to 1772 , when he switched his summer residence to Kew Palace and had Richmond Lodge demolished . 
 In 1751 , Caroline 's daughter Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park after the death of Robert Walpole . Immediately afterwards , the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public , only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to enter . This continued until 1758 , when a local brewer , John Lewis , took the gatekeeper , who stopped him from entering the park , to court . The court ruled in favour of Lewis , citing the fact that , when Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century , he allowed the public right of way in the park . Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 Full right of public access to the park was confirmed by Act of Parliament in 1872 . However , people were no longer given the right to remove firewood ; this is still the case and helps in preserving the park . 
 Between 1833 and 1842 the Petersham Lodge estate , and then part of Sudbrook Park , were incorporated into Richmond Park . Terrace Walk was created from Richmond Gate to Pembroke Lodge . The Russell School was built near Petersham Gate in 1851 . Between 1855 and 1861 , new drainage improvements were constructed , including drinking points for deer . In 1867 and 1876 fallow deer from the park were sent to New Zealand to help build up stocks – the first fallow deer introduced to that country In or around 1870 , the Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers were using an area near Bog Gate as a drill ground . Giuseppe Garibaldi , Italian general and politician , visited Lord John Russell at Pembroke Lodge in 1864 , as did the Shah of Persia , Naser al @-@ Din Shah Qajar in 1873 . He was the first modern Iranian monarch to visit Europe .

 Edward VII developed the park as a public amenity by opening up almost all the previously fenced woods and making public those gates that were previously private . From 1915 level areas of the park were marked out for football and cricket pitches . A golf course was developed on the former " Great Paddock " of Richmond Park , an area used for feeding deer for the royal hunt . The tree belt in this part of the park was supplemented by additional planting in 1936 . The golf course was opened in 1923 by Edward , Prince of Wales ( who was to become King Edward VIII and , after his abdication , Duke of Windsor ) . The future king had been born in the park , at White Lodge , in 1894 . 
 The park played an important role during World War I and was used for cavalry training . On 7 December 1915 English inventor Harry <unk> Matthews demonstrated , in a secret test on Pen Ponds , how selenium cells would work in a remotely controlled prototype weapon for use against German Zeppelins . Reporting on this story several years later , in April 1924 , The Daily Chronicle reported that the test had been carried out in the presence of Lord Balfour , Lord Fisher and a staff of experts . Its success led to Matthews receiving a payment of £ 25 @,@ 000 from the Government the very next morning . Despite this large sum changing hands , the Admiralty never used the invention . Between 1916 and 1925 the park housed a South African military war hospital , which was built between Bishop 's Pond and Conduit Wood . The hospital closed in 1921 and was demolished in 1925 . Richmond Cemetery , just outside the park , contains a section of war graves commemorating 39 soldiers who died at the hospital ; the section is marked by a Cross of Sacrifice and a grade II listed cenotaph designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens .

 Faisal I of Iraq and Lebanese politician Salim Ali Salam were photographed visiting the park in 1925 . In 1938 , an army camp was set up near Dann 's Pond . During World War II Pembroke Lodge was used as the base for " Phantom " ( the GHQ Liaison Regiment ) . The Pen Ponds were drained , in order to disguise them as a landmark , and an experimental bomb disposal centre was set up at <unk> Corner , which is between Robin Hood Gate and Roehampton Gate . Picture Post , on 13 December 1941 , featured a photograph of an anti @-@ aircraft gun site inside Sheen Gate . The Russell School was destroyed by enemy action in 1943 and Sheen Cottage a year later . For the 1948 Summer Olympics , an Olympic village was built near Dann 's Pond . In 1953 President Tito of Yugoslavia stayed at White Lodge during a state visit to Britain . 
 The Petersham Hole was a sink hole caused by subsidence of a sewer which forced the total closure of the <unk> road in Petersham in 1979 – 80 . As the hole and subsequent repair work had forced a total closure of this main road between Richmond and Kingston , traffic was diverted through the park and the Richmond , Ham , and Kingston gates remained open throughout the day and night . The park road was widened at Ham Cross near Ham Gate to accommodate temporary traffic lights . About 10 deer a month were killed by traffic while the diversion was in operation . In the 2012 Summer Olympics the men 's and the women 's cycling road races went through the park .

 When the park was enclosed in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall : Coombe Gate , Ham Gate , Richmond Gate , Robin Hood Gate , Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate . Of these , Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic . The present gates were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896 . Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it . The present double gates date from 1926 . Coombe Gate ( later known as Ladderstile Gate ) provided access to the park for the parishioners of Coombe , with both a gate and a step ladder . The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735 . The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis 's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884 . The present gate dates from 1901 . The present wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899 . Ham Gate was widened in 1921 , when the present wrought iron gates were installed . The chinoiserie lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825 . 
 Robin Hood Gate takes its name from the nearby Robin Hood Inn ( demolished in 2001 ) and is close to what is called the Robin Hood roundabout on the A3 . Widened in 1907 , it has been closed to motorised vehicles since a 2003 traffic reduction trial . Alterations commenced in March 2013 to make the gates more suitable for pedestrian use and return some of the hard surface to parkland .

 Chohole Gate served the farm that stood within the park on the site of the present Kings Farm Plantation . It is first mentioned in 1680 . The gate now provides access to Richmond Park Golf Course . Kingston Gate dates from about 1750 . The existing gates date from 1898 . 
 Public access via Bog Gate or Queen 's Gate ( built in 1736 ) , 24 hours a day , was granted in 1894 and the present " cradle " gate installed . The gate connects the park with East Sheen Common . 
 Petersham Gate served the Russell School , replacing the more ornate gates to Petersham Lodge . A disused carriage gate further up the hill was probably a tradesman 's entrance to the school or to the Lodge stables . Bishop 's Gate in Chisholm Road , previously known as the Cattle Gate , was for use by livestock allowed to pasture in the nineteenth century . It was opened for public use in 1896 . Kitchen Garden Gate , hidden behind Teck Plantation , is probably a nineteenth @-@ century gate . It has never been open to the public . Cambrian Gate or Cambrian Road Gate was constructed during World War I for access to the newly built South Africa Military Hospital . When the hospital was demolished in 1925 , the entrance was made permanent and public as a pedestrian gate .

 The park includes a Grade I listed building , White Lodge . The boundary wall of the park is Grade II listed as are ten other buildings : Ham Gate Lodge , built in 1742 ; Holly Lodge ( formerly known as Bog Lodge ) and the game larder in its courtyard , built in 1735 ; Pembroke Lodge ; Richmond Gate and Richmond Gate Lodge , dated 1798 and designed by Sir John Soane ; Thatched House Lodge ; and White Ash Lodge and its barns and stables , built in the 1730s or 1740s . 
 The <unk> or " deer leap " is a strip of land 5m ( 16 ' 6 " ) wide , running around most of the perimeter of the park . Owned by the Crown , it allows access to the outside of the boundary wall for inspection and repairs . Householders whose property backs on to the park can use this land by paying an annual fee .

 In 1735 , a new lodge , Cooper 's Lodge , was built on the site of Hill Farm . It was later known as Lucas 's Lodge and as Bog Lodge . Bog Lodge was renamed Holly Lodge in 1993 and now contains a visitors ' centre ( bookings only ) , the park 's administrative headquarters and a base for the Metropolitan Police 's Royal Parks Operational Command Unit . 
 Holly Lodge also includes the Holly Lodge Centre , an organisation which provides an opportunity for people of all ages and abilities to enjoy and learn from a series of hands @-@ on experiences , focusing particularly on the environment and in the Victorian history and heritage of Richmond Park . The Centre , which is wheelchair @-@ accessible throughout , was opened in 1994 . It was founded by Mike <unk> OBE , who was then The Royal Parks ' Superintendent of Richmond Park and later became Deputy Chief Executive of London 's Royal Parks . A registered charity , the Holly Lodge Centre received the Queen 's Award for Voluntary Service in 2005 . 
 In 2007 Princess Alexandra agreed to become Holly Lodge Centre 's Royal Patron . In 2011 she opened the Centre 's Victorian @-@ themed pharmacy , Mr Palmer 's <unk> . This includes the original interior , artefacts and dispensing records dating from 1865 , from a chemist 's shop in Mortlake , and is used for educational activities . The Centre also includes a replica Victorian kitchen , Mrs Sawyer 's Victorian Kitchen , and a kitchen garden planted with varieties of vegetables used in Victorian times and herbs cultivated for their medicinal properties .

 Thatched House Lodge was the London home of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower during the Second World War . Since 1963 it has been the residence of Princess Alexandra , The Honourable Lady Ogilvy . The residence was originally built as two houses in 1673 for two Richmond Park Keepers , as Aldridge Lodge . Enlarged in 1727 , the two houses were joined and renamed Thatched House Lodge in 1771 by Sir John Soane . The gardens include an 18th @-@ century two @-@ room thatched summer house which gave the main house its name .

 Built as a hunting lodge for George II by the architect Roger Morris , White Lodge was completed in 1730 . Its many famous residents have included members of the Royal Family . The future Edward VIII was born at White Lodge in 1894 and his brother Prince Albert , Duke of York ( the future George VI ) , and the Duchess of York ( later Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother ) , lived there in the 1920s . The Royal Ballet School ( formerly Sadler 's Wells Ballet ) has been based since 1955 at White Lodge where younger ballet students continue to be trained .

 Oak Lodge , near Sidmouth Wood , was built in about 1852 as a home for the park bailiff , who was responsible for repair and maintenance in the park . It is used by The Royal Parks as its base for a similar function today . 
 There are also gate lodges at Bishops Gate , Chohole Gate , Kingston Gate , Robin Hood Gate , Roehampton Gate and at Sheen Gate , which also has a bungalow ( Sheen Gate Bungalow ) . Ladderstile Cottage , at Ladderstile Gate , was built in the 1780s .

 A map by John Eyre , " Plan of His Majesty 's New Park " , shows a summerhouse near Richmond Gate . 
 Several buildings already existed within the park when it was created . One of these was a manor house at Petersham which was renamed Petersham Lodge . During the Commonwealth period it became accommodation for one of the park 's deputy keepers , <unk> <unk> ( or Carlile ) , who was also a renowned playwright in his day , and his wife , Joan Carlile , one of the very first women to practise painting professionally . 
 Elizabeth , Countess of Dysart , and her husband Sir Lionel Tollemache , took over Petersham Lodge when they became joint keepers of Richmond Park . After Tollemache 's death the Lodge and its surrounding land were leased in 1686 to Lawrence Hyde , Earl of Rochester , whose sister Anne was married to the new king , James II . It became a private park and was subsequently landscaped . By 1692 Rochester had demolished the Lodge and replaced it with a splendid new mansion in his " New Park " . In 1732 , a new Petersham Lodge was built to replace it after a fire . This Petersham Lodge was demolished in 1835 . 
 Professor Sir Richard Owen , the first Director of the Natural History Museum , lived at Sheen Cottage until his death in 1892 . The cottage was destroyed by enemy action in 1944 . The remains of the cottage can be seen in patches and irregularities in the wall 220 metres from Sheen Gate . 
 A bandstand , similar to one in Kensington Gardens , was erected near Richmond Gate in 1931 . In 1975 , after many years of disuse , it was moved to Regent 's Park .
