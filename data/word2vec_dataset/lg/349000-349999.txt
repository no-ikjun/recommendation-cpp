 His eldest son , George W. Bush , was inaugurated as the 43rd President of the United States on January 20 , 2001 , and re @-@ elected in 2004 . Through previous administrations , the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as " George Bush " or " President Bush " , but following his son 's election the need to distinguish between them has made <unk> forms such as " George H. W. Bush " and " George Bush senior " — and colloquialisms such as " Bush 41 " and " Bush the Elder " much more common .

 The George Bush Presidential Library is the presidential library named for Bush . This tenth presidential library was built between 1995 and 1997 and contains the presidential and vice @-@ presidential papers of Bush and the vice @-@ presidential papers of Dan Quayle . It was dedicated on November 6 , 1997 , and opened to the public shortly thereafter ; the architectural firm of Hellmuth , Obata and Kassabaum designed the complex . 
 The George Bush Presidential Library and Museum is located on a 90 @-@ acre ( 360 @,@ 000 m2 ) site on the west campus of Texas A & M University in College Station , Texas , on a plaza adjoining the Presidential Conference Center and the Texas A & M Academic Center . The Library operates under NARA 's administration and the Presidential Libraries Act of 1955 's provisions . 
 The George Bush School of Government and Public Service is a graduate public policy school at Texas A & M University in College Station , Texas . The graduate school is part of the presidential library complex , and offers four programs : two master 's degree programs ( Public Service Administration and International Affairs ) and two certificate programs ( Advanced International Affairs and Homeland Security ) . The master 's program in International Affairs ( <unk> ) program offers concentration on either National Security Affairs or International Economics and Development .

 Bush continues to make many public appearances . He and Mrs. Bush attended the state funeral of Ronald Reagan in June 2004 , and of Gerald Ford in January 2007 . One month later , he was awarded the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award in Beverly Hills , California , by former First Lady Nancy Reagan . Despite his political differences with Bill Clinton , it has been acknowledged that the two former presidents have become friends . He and Clinton appeared together in television ads in 2005 , encouraging aid for victims of Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami . 
 In October 2006 , Bush was honored by the National Italian American Foundation ( <unk> ) with the <unk> One America Award for fundraising , with Bill Clinton , for the victims of the 2004 tsunami and Hurricane Katrina . 
 Upon the death of Gerald Ford , Bush became the oldest living ( former ) president , 111 days older than Jimmy Carter . 
 On February 18 , 2008 , Bush formally endorsed Senator John McCain for the presidency of the United States . The endorsement offered a boost to McCain 's campaign , as the Arizona Senator had been facing criticism among many conservatives . 
 On January 10 , 2009 , both George H. W. and George W. Bush were present at the commissioning of the USS George H.W. Bush ( CVN @-@ 77 ) , the tenth and last Nimitz @-@ class supercarrier of the United States Navy . Bush paid a visit to the carrier again on May 26 , 2009 . 
 On February 15 , 2011 , he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom — the highest civilian honor in the United States — by President Barack Obama . 
 Bush suffers from Vascular <unk> , a form of Parkinson 's disease which has forced him to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair since at least 2012 . 
 In July 2013 , Bush had his head shaved in a show of support for the two @-@ year @-@ old son of a member of his security detail , who had leukemia . 
 In April 2014 , Frederick D. McClure , chief executive of the Bush library foundation , organized a three @-@ day gathering in College Park , Texas , to mark the 25th anniversary of the Bush administration . Also in early 2014 , the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation presented the Profile in Courage Award to Bush and Mount Vernon awarded him its first Cyrus A. Ansary Prize . The Kennedy foundation award was presented by Jack Schlossberg , the late president 's grandson , to Lauren Bush Lauren , who accepted on her grandfather 's behalf . The Ansary prize was presented in Houston with Ansary , Barbara Lucas , Ryan C. Crocker , dean of the Bush school since January 2010 , Barbara Bush , and Curt <unk> in attendance with the former president . Fifty thousand dollars of the prize was directed by Bush to the Bush school at Texas A & M and $ 25 @,@ 000 will fund an animation about the Siege of Yorktown for Mt . Vernon . <unk> and Lucas represented Mount Vernon at the presentation . 
 On June 12 , 2014 , Bush fulfilled a long @-@ standing promise by skydiving on his 90th birthday . He made the parachute jump from a helicopter near his home at 11 : 15 a.m. in Kennebunkport , Maine . The jump marked the eighth time the former president had <unk> , including jumps on his 80th and 85th birthday as well . He had tweeted about the incident prior to the jump , saying " It 's a wonderful day in Maine — in fact , nice enough for a parachute jump . " 
 In July 2015 , Bush suffered a severe neck injury . Wearing a neck brace in October in his first public engagement since the accident , he threw the ceremonial first pitch for the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park , at the age of 91 .

 = Iridion 3D = 
 Iridion 3D is a quasi @-@ 3D rail shooter video game developed by Shin 'en . A launch title for the Game Boy Advance portable game console , it was released in North America on May 29 , 2001 and in Europe on September 21 the same year . Influenced by the Commodore 64 game <unk> , the game features a single starship fighting the alien Iridion , who have attacked Earth . Iridion spans seven levels from Earth to the aliens ' home planet , each with a fixed linear path that ends with a boss . 
 Iridion began development as a shooter for the Game Boy Color ; when Shin 'en decided to drop development and shift their focus to the Game Boy Advance , Iridion was the first game by the developer to appear on the system . Though billed as a 3D game , Shin 'en used realtime encoding and resizing to manipulate the size of 2D sprites instead of creating a true 3D environment . More room on the game cartridge was available for graphics due to the game 's use of the <unk> Sound Engine , which allowed real @-@ time decoding of song data in a small file size . 
 On release Iridion garnered generally poor reviews . The graphics and sound were generally praised ; even a year after its release , critics at TechTV considered it the best @-@ looking game on the platform . In contrast , critics derided the game 's repetitive and frustrating gameplay . Despite lukewarm reception to the title upon release , Iridion 3D influenced future Shin 'en shooters such as Iridion II and <unk> . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game is a simple forward @-@ scrolling rail shooter , similar to the Star Fox series . Only the Game Boy Advance 's directional pad , A , and Start buttons are used during gameplay . The ship remains locked at a set speed and cannot brake or speed up . 
 The player encounters more than fifteen types of enemy , not including level bosses . Some are easy to destroy ; others , including the fire creatures found on the Iridion home world , are indestructible and must be avoided . Other enemies prevent the player from dodging enemy fire by laying mines to block paths . Passive objects , such as garbage or asteroids , can damage or destroy the player 's craft . Enemies vary in armor and weaponry — some cannot return fire but travel in waves to ram the player . 
 Each level has the player follow a linear path through waves of enemies and culminates with a boss . In boss stages the player 's craft does not move forward , but hovers in front of the boss . Each boss has a single vulnerability which flashes when hit . These areas are often heavily shielded and must be hit repeatedly to remove armor . Other bosses ' vulnerabilities are hidden and appear for only short periods . Most bosses have weapons that fire upon the player or reflect the player 's shots . At the end of each level , players receive bonuses for defeated enemies , lives remaining , and the energy level of the player 's craft . An extra life is granted if the score reaches certain thresholds . 
 Iridion 3D features five types of weapons , with three levels of power each . Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups of the color that matches the current weapon . Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type . If the player 's ship is destroyed the power level of the weapon is reduced by one . Each weapon has advantages and disadvantages . The player starts with the red weapon , which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread . Green weapons are inaccurate but fill the screen with shots . Purple weapons spin in a counterclockwise motion slowly and are fairly strong . Yellow torpedo @-@ like weapons are very powerful but powerups are rare and the weapon fires slowly . Blue weapons , a more powerful version of Yellow weapons , are found only on the last level . Flashing powerups restore the craft 's shields . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the opening cinematic of Iridion 3D Earth is attacked without warning by the Iridion , who take over much of the surface and lay mines in orbit and bombs in the Pacific Ocean . The player is the pilot of an experimental SHN fighter , the last hope for defending Earth from the Iridion . The player pilots his ship alone against hordes of Iridion fighters and natural obstacles . The early stages begin on Earth , with the player fighting through an Iridion garbage tunnel . The player proceeds to the Pacific Ocean and destroys much of the Iridion invasion fleet on Earth before heading into the stratosphere to destroy the orbital blockade around Earth and subsequently annihilating the Iridion boss at the Moon . 
 With the invasion fleet in ruins , the player heads into the far reaches of space . After destroying an Iridion mining colony within an asteroid belt , the player proceeds into the Iridion home system . Eventually the player fights the Iridion on their home world , destroying the Iridion " mainframe " and ending the alien threat forever . 
 = = Development = = 
 Iridion started development as a shooter for the Game Boy Color ; on January 10 , 2001 , Shin 'en announced they would stop making games for the Color , instead working on games exclusively for the Game Boy Advance . Iridion 's executive producer was Dan Kitchen , a former programmer for Atari . Iridion 3D was Shin 'en 's first product to utilize the <unk> Sound Engine , which allowed real @-@ time decoding of song data in an extremely small file size ; this allowed more space on the cartridge to be used for graphics . 
 Although advertised as a 3D game , Iridion 3D uses solely 2D graphics for texture scrolling and sprites which depict explosions and enemies . The developers create the illusion of 3D by looping background textures — a graphically intensive technique for the Game Boy Advance . Graphical objects shrink or enlarge to depict position relative to the player . Level environments feature changes such as progression from day to night . Kitchen , Majesco 's vice president of handhelds , wrote that " by pushing the graphics hardware of the Game Boy Advance to its technical limits , Iridion 3D provides a truly realistic 3D gaming experience . " He hoped that " players will be amazed that such smooth environments and intense gameplay can now be achieved on a portable system . " 
 By March 2001 , the GBA version of Iridion was shown in workable form . IGN saw early screens and declared that Iridion was " aiming to set the standard [ of what GBA shooters should be ] ... Set the standard with a hail of bullets . " They felt Shin 'en was pushing the Game Boy Advance to its limits , producing the most stunning game seen at the time for the handheld system . GameSpot 's Ben Stahl previewed Iridion 3D on March 21 , 2001 , shortly before the release of the game in the United States . He noted the excellent graphics and high frame rate , ending with " At this point , Iridion 3D looks like it could be a great game for fans of the genre . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 Despite praise for its graphics and sound , Iridion 3D was received mixed reviews from critics ; the game received 53 % and 57 % ratings on review aggregate web sites Metacritic and Game Rankings , respectively . 
 The graphics were almost universally praised . Andrew Bub of GameSpy asserted that Nintendo should have used Iridion to advertise the Game Boy Advance , as it took full advantage of the system 's power . A year after its release , TechTV 's Miguel Concepcion argued it was still the best @-@ looking game for the system . Miguel Lopez of GameSpot lauded the graphics , writing that " while it 's ultimately all smoke and mirrors , Iridion 's world is richly detailed , has remarkable depth , and is unbelievably fluid . It 's often hard to tell if the game 's backgrounds are composed of streaming full motion video or just some really fancy math @-@ powered 2D bitmaps . " 
 In contrast to praise for Iridion 's graphics , its actual gameplay was generally panned . IGN 's Craig Harris wrote that " Shin 'en 's shooter for the Game Boy Advance will impress with all its effects , but that 's about it . " He noted that the player is limited to shooting and dodging , making gameplay repetitive . Harris and Concepcion complained that on a small screen distances are hard to judge ; the player 's ship is hit by bullets that appear to be in the distance . Bub and Game Informer 's Jay <unk> criticized the craft placement , as the player 's view was often obscured by their own ship . Lopez also gave Iridion low marks , warning that " after the initial ' wow ' wears off , you 'll be stuck with an empty experience . " Edge observed that Iridion is " a sweet number that will entertain , if only for a week or so " . Allgame 's Skyler Miller said Iridion 3D was nothing more than a technology demo and awarded it two out of five stars . A more positive review came from GamePro , whose reviewer summed up his experience by writing that " if you 're looking for some classic shooter action on your new GBA , Iridion 3D will fit the bill nicely without blowing you away . " 
 Positive comments were usually directed at sound ; <unk> said that " The soundtrack is an instant classic , maybe even one of the best shooter scores ever . " Concepcion noted that the game 's mood @-@ fitting " high energy techno " was an oddity coming from a German game company . Despite poor reviews , Shin 'en 's Manfred <unk> felt that Iridion 3D was the best game for the Game Boy Advance without licensed characters . 
 = La Blanca , Peten = 
 La Blanca is a Maya archaeological site in the municipality of Melchor de Mencos in the northern Petén Department of Guatemala . The site is located in the lower reaches of the Mopan River valley and features a large acropolis complex . Activity at the site has been dated as far back as the Early Classic ( AD 250 – 600 ) , with principal occupation of the site occurring in the Late Classic period ( AD 600 – 900 ) , although some level of occupation continued into the Early Postclassic ( AD 900 – 1200 ) . 
 La Blanca occupied a frontier zone between the northeastern and southeastern Petén regions and the site is dominated by the acropolis , an especially well built palace complex . The city appears to have been an administrative centre with comparatively little emphasis upon religious or ceremonial activity . It is likely that La Blanca was a subsidiary of a major Maya city such as Yaxha or Naranjo , given the complete absence of hieroglyphic texts and sculpted monuments , and archaeologists presume that La Blanca served as a frontier post or trading centre . 
 During the Late Classic there was greater public access to the acropolis ; as the threat of warfare grew during the Terminal Classic ( AD 800 @-@ 900 ) , access became much more restricted . The end of formal occupation of the city in the Terminal Classic appears to have been violent , with evidence of a battle recovered during excavations of the acropolis . Refugees appear to have occupied the city centre immediately after the collapse of formal settlement at La Blanca , but they abandoned the city for good in the 11th century , after which it was never reoccupied . 
 The acropolis buildings contain inscribed graffiti dating to the last phase of occupation in the Early Postclassic , including human and animal figures , deities , temples and courtly scenes . Colonial graffiti is also evident from the visit to the ruins by captain Pedro Montañés in the middle of the 18th century . 
 = = Location = = 
 La Blanca is accessed by a dirt road leading 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) to the highway linking Flores with Melchor de Mencos ; the dirt road joins the highway at La Pólvora . In the other direction this road leads approximately 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to a village , also called La Blanca ; this modern village extends along the shores of a small lake . The archaeological site is located to the south of a range of hills reaching a maximum height of 490 metres ( 1 @,@ 610 ft ) . 
 The site occupies a small pocket of forest amongst an extensive region of cleared agricultural land . The agricultural land closest to the ruins is largely dedicated to livestock grazing , particularly cattle and horses . La Blanca is located close to the Mopan River and its tributary , the <unk> River . Some of the land between the ruins and the rivers is subject to frequent flooding , a factor that must have had some impact upon the inhabitants of the city . 
 The forest covering the archaeological site reaches an average height of 22 metres ( 72 ft ) . It contains around 60 tree species , among which the most notable are <unk> trees ( Brosimum alicastrum ) and <unk> palms ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 = = History = = 
 The earliest occupation at La Blanca was concentrated in the South Group and dates to the Early Classic Period . However , major occupation of the site appears to have begun in the Late Classic Period . Public spaces were covered with white stucco and the first architecture was erected at the site . The basal platform of the acropolis appears to have been built before the Great North Plaza was laid out . 
 In the Late Classic there appears to have been greater public access to the acropolis , with stairways communicating between the various terraces leading up to the south range . During the Terminal Classic , these stairways were filled in , as were many of the access doorways to the acropolis itself , with some buildings being sealed completely . This closing of public access to the palace reflects the greater political instability engulfing the entire Petén region at this time . The acropolis complex was abandoned by the city 's elite in the Terminal Classic , a time when most of the city centre was also deserted by its residents . Many flint projectile points were recovered from the south terraces of the acropolis , this combined with the remains of two individuals very near the surface indicates that a violent confrontation took place around the time that the city was abandoned . 
 Soon afterwards , at the dawn of the Postclassic , immediately after the Classic Maya collapse , the acropolis was reoccupied by refugees from the periphery of the city . These final occupants appear to have abandoned the city some time in the 11th century AD , after which it was never reoccupied . 
 = = = Modern history = = = 
 In the 18th century Pedro Montañés passed through the site and left graffiti with his name and the year 1752 . Archives have revealed that he was a Spanish captain who visited the site on 14 August of that year . La Blanca was first documented in the early years of the 20th century . In 1905 explorer Teoberto Maler identified visible architecture at the site and marked it as El <unk> on a map of the region . Raymond E. Merwin visited La Blanca in 1913 on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University . He photographed the site and renamed it as Chac @-@ Ha . At this time the site appears to have been covered in dense vegetation , making exploration of the ruins difficult and resulting in only a brief description of the acropolis . 
 Ian Graham published a plan of the site in 1980 , based on explorations in preceding years . Further explorations have taken place on behalf of the Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala and the Yaxha @-@ Nakum @-@ Naranjo Project . The Yaxha @-@ Nakum @-@ Naranjo Project started work at the site in 1994 with preliminary work consisted of mapping and photographing the ruins . In 1995 the ruins were cleared of undergrowth and in 1996 the Unidad de <unk> Regional de Guatemala ( Guatemalan Regional Archaeology Unit ) surveyed the ruins , recorded damage by looters and sank test pits , all under the direction of Vilma <unk> . From 1997 to 1998 looting damage was repaired and architecture deemed at risk of collapse was underpinned . In 1999 further underpinning work was undertaken as a result of earthquake damage and detailed plans were made of the architecture in 2000 . The Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala included La Blanca in its survey of three sites in the lower Mopan valley in 2001 . More recently , investigations have been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Culture together with the University of Valencia and the Polytechnic University of Valencia . Excavations continued in 2004 both in the city centre and in the South Group , where looting damage was recorded and repaired . 
 = = Site description = = 
 The site covers an area of about 26 hectares ( 64 acres ) and a great many structures have been identified by archaeologists . The principal architecture has been dated to the Late Classic period . The layout of the city is somewhat unusual in that the north @-@ south axis is oriented 12 ° west of north whereas most Maya cities have the major axis a similar amount east of north . The political and administrative functions were concentrated in the eastern portion of the city , which is taken to include the South Group , as evidenced by the superior architectural quality in these areas . 
 The Great North Plaza is a large square @-@ plan plaza measuring 70 by 70 metres ( 230 by 230 ft ) . The Plaza was levelled by packing it with a clay @-@ based mud , work that took place in the Late Classic Period based on the evidence of ceramic and flint artefacts recovered during investigations . This clay mud <unk> <unk> was likely to have been brought to the city from the nearby swamps . Excavations in the plaza and close to the acropolis revealed the presence of a retaining wall probably related to the construction of the great platform supporting the acropolis itself . 
 A 30 @-@ metre ( 98 ft ) wide causeway runs south from the Plaza , running to the west of the acropolis and parallel to it . This causeway runs south for approximately 300 metres ( 980 ft ) to the South Group . The area west of the causeway contains a large number of smaller mounds and platforms and is believed to be an extensive residential area . This residential area includes three large plazas , the northern of which is divided from the Great North Plaza by a row of structures . A stairway may have led southwards from this down to the Central West Plaza , which is on the opposite side of the causeway from the Acropolis . The south side of the Central West Plaza is bordered by a 30 @-@ metre ( 98 ft ) long structure that divides it from the South West Plaza . An area of smaller mounds extends further west and are believed to represent lesser residential districts of the city . 
 The area to the east of the city drops away rapidly and lacks extensive settlement remains , perhaps due to periodic flooding by the Mopan and <unk> rivers discouraging the occupation of the eastern zone . 
 = = = Acropolis = = = 
 The most important architectural complex is the acropolis , a palace with an enclosed courtyard located within the Great North Plaza . The acropolis is also known as the Quadrangle due to its layout . A series of terraces lead down from the acropolis to a 1 @,@ 500 @-@ square @-@ metre ( 16 @,@ 000 sq ft ) reservoir to the south , which appears to have been a private water source for the palace . The reservoir itself is now dried out . The acropolis was accessed via a wide stairway from the Great North Plaza . The form of the plaza and the acropolis are unusual , although similar complexes have been identified at Tayasal , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Excavations in the acropolis revealed the presence of at least two superimposed platforms built with finely dressed stone blocks and covered with good quality stucco flooring . At a later date the platforms and courtyard were covered with unworked stones bound with mortar and covered with another stucco floor . The two platforms were built in the Late Classic and appear to have been covered over in the Terminal Classic . 
 The interior courtyard measures approximately 36 metres ( 118 ft ) on each side and was completely enclosed by the palace , creating a very private space within . The buildings on the north , west and south sides faced outwards away from the private courtyard , opening onto it only via a central doorway in each structure . The eastern structure was built at a later date , has two lateral doorways and was the only side to face directly onto the courtyard ; it highly may have been the residence of the city 's ruler . Entrance to the courtyard is from the exterior the acropolis via these central doorways on the north , south and west sides . Of these three entrances , the northern entrance appears to have been the main entrance to the acropolis complex . The south entrance was a more private entrance that opened from the acropolis onto the terraces leading down to the water source in that direction . The western entrance lead to the terrace 5 metres ( 16 ft ) above the causeway , providing a balcony with an excellent view across the city . 
 The cut stone walls of the acropolis are of very high quality , constructed of large , finely cut blocks at times forming walls almost 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) thick , filled with rubble and mortar . The exterior faces of the walls are carefully dressed and the interior of good quality vaulted ceilings . Although such high quality work can be found in parts of major cities such as Tikal , its presence in a smaller site such as La Blanca is considered surprising by archaeologists . The walls facing the interior courtyard have been especially well preserved . During survey work at the <unk> , archaeologists discovered a 13 @.@ 5 @-@ centimetre ( 5 @.@ 3 in ) long flint knife deliberately embedded in the interior of the north wall , it weighed 225 grams ( 7 @.@ 9 oz ) . The knife was embedded in the mortar of the infill with the blade pointing outwards , with three embedded decorations near the tip . Archaeologists believe the blade was deposited during rituals associated with the construction of the building . 
 The outer eastern wall of the acropolis is especially well preserved , including a cornice 3 @.@ 8 metres ( 12 ft ) above the floor level of the building , which is 4 to 5 metres ( 13 to 16 ft ) above the plaza floor . The wall continued above the cornice for another 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) and this section probably supported a stucco frieze . The entire eastern face of the building measured 32 metres ( 105 ft ) long and stood 12 to 13 metres ( 39 to 43 ft ) above the level of the Great North Plaza . This wall was completely blank , without any doorways or other openings . 
 The range structures on the other sides of the courtyards , all opening outwards away from it , consisted of a series of rooms of varying size . The height of the rooms from the palace floor to the top of the vaulting was generally about 6 metres ( 20 ft ) throughout the palace . The interior walls were originally painted red and black as demonstrated by surviving traces of pigment . The exterior facades of the range structures were originally decorated with sculpted stone friezes representing supernatural beings , fragments of which have been found amongst the collapsed rubble . 
 The vaulted ceilings of the palace were <unk> constructed , with sides of equal length unlike in other sites in the Petén region where the sides of vaulted ceilings were often of different lengths . The vaulting is of exceptional height , reaching up to 4 metres ( 13 ft ) . 
 = = = = South range = = = = 
 The south range measures 42 metres ( 138 ft ) long and divides the courtyard from the series of terraces to the south . The rooms of the south range include wide benches running their entire width , they measure 0 @.@ 75 metres ( 2 @.@ 5 ft ) high and still preserve their original stucco covering . The bench in Room 1 has a small step leading up to it . The walls of the rooms are relatively poorly preserved , although some parts still retain their stucco covering and traces of pigment , as well as inscribed graffiti . The lintels over the doors were crafted from <unk> wood . Some of the south @-@ facing rooms have twin , symmetrically placed doorways , a style of architecture that is very unusual for a range structure in the Petén region . Examples are known from minor structures at Tikal but the closest corresponding architecture comes from the Puuc region of the northern Yucatán Peninsula , at cities such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , although they differ in other particulars , such as the vaulting . 
 Excavations immediately south of the south range uncovered part of a substructure consisting of a well @-@ preserved stucco @-@ covered talud wall and a stairway , these are thought to be the remains of a terrace platform . A portion of a second terrace talud wall was also uncovered . 
 = = = West Group = = = 
 Investigations of the West Group have revealed an occupation beginning in the Late Classic and reaching its maximum extent in the Terminal Classic . The construction methods used in the West Group were inferior to those of the acropolis , consisting of finely cut limestone blocks bound with an earth @-@ based mortar rather than the lime @-@ based mortar used in the palace complex . The platforms of the West Group appear to have supported perishable superstructures and some of these buildings may have been dedicated to craft production . 
 The three main plazas of the West Group appear to have lacked stucco flooring and were instead covered with stone chippings . 
 = = = South Group = = = 
 The South Group is the furthest group from the centre to possess monumental architecture . The South Group is the oldest architectural group at La Blanca , with occupation dating as far back as the Early Classic . It has a slightly different orientation to the rest of the site , apparently due to its earlier construction . It consists of number of medium @-@ sized mounds that have been badly damaged by looters . The larger of the mounds are pyramids and there were also a number of other buildings . One of the mounds measures approximately 9 metres ( 30 ft ) high and was almost cut in half by a looters ' trench . Rescue operations uncovered ceramic remains dating to the Late Classic , including a piece bearing a fragment of hieroglyphic text . 
 Excavations in 2008 revealed that one of these mounds was a temple pyramid with a well @-@ preserved central stairway . 
 = = Graffiti = = 
 The acropolis is also distinguished by a great quantity of graffiti inscribed onto the stucco interior walls of its rooms , some of which display a considerable level of artistic skill . The graffiti is believed to date to the last phase of occupation of the acropolis , during the Early Postclassic , and includes local fauna and human figures , some of which are playing musical instruments . Animals depicted in the graffiti include a deer , a turtle and a frog . Two human figures are depicted playing flutes , while other subjects include pyramid temples , courtly scenes , vulvas and supernatural beings . 
 Analysis of pigment traces from the south range of the acropolis were carried out by the Polytechnic University of Valencia , they revealed a preference for mineral and vegetable pigments of local origin , perhaps collected from the nearby El <unk> hill . 
 = = Artefacts = = 
 Many of the artefacts excavated from the acropolis date from the transition from the Terminal Classic Period to the Early Postclassic , when the surrounding population appears to have occupied the abandoned palace . Excavations of the south range of the acropolis uncovered a great many potsherds ( roughly 11 @,@ 000 ) dating to the Terminal Classic , and about 150 pieces dating to the Early Postclassic . In the same building 150 stone artefacts were excavated together with hundreds of fragments of waste chippings . Fifteen incomplete ceramic figurines were also found , including zoomorphic figures and elite human figures with elaborate headdresses . One of these figurines was a whistle in the shape of an owl , identical to another found in an excavated rubbish heap in the acropolis courtyard . Both of these owl @-@ shaped whistles are very similar to a larger whistle found at Yaxha . A number of artefacts were recovered from the threshold of Room 3 of the south range , including a complete terminal classic ceramic vessel , a flint knife , some broken figurine fragments and some lithic fragments . In the area of the threshold of Room 4 in the south range a complete Early Postclassic tripod plate was recovered . Within Room 4 itself were found a further 70 broken pieces of Terminal Classic ceramics and 232 pieces dated to the Early Postclassic , and a greenstone axe among other finds . Many of the Postclassic fragments were from a tripod pitcher with zoomorph supports that archaeologists were largely able to reconstruct . Additionally , 798 Terminal Classic ceramic fragments were found during the exploration of the terraces immediately south of the acropolis , together with stone chippings and pieces of animal bones . 
 Pits sunk within the courtyard of the acropolis revealed <unk> ceramic fragments , 22 fragments of zoomorphic figurines , together with stone and shell artefacts , animal bones and waste flint chips , all dated to the Terminal Classic . 
 Analysis of artefacts from La Blanca has revealed an unusual and almost total absence of obsidian , while flint of various colours ( including red , pink , orange , brown , cream and grey ) is particularly common . 
 = = Burials = = 
 A human burial was found in Room 3 of the south range of the Acropolis . The remains were found lying on their right side facing towards the west , with arms bent . Preliminary investigation suggests that the remains are those of a young adult male with a height of approximately 1 @.@ 6 metres ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) . The left hand side of the skull is deformed , perhaps as a result of either <unk> or <unk> . 
 = Oil shale = 
 Oil shale , also known as kerogen shale , is an organic @-@ rich fine @-@ grained sedimentary rock containing kerogen ( a solid mixture of organic chemical compounds ) from which liquid hydrocarbons called shale oil ( not to be confused with tight oil — crude oil occurring naturally in shales ) can be produced . Shale oil is a substitute for conventional crude oil ; however , extracting shale oil from oil shale is more costly than the production of conventional crude oil both financially and in terms of its environmental impact . Deposits of oil shale occur around the world , including major deposits in the United States . Estimates of global deposits range from 4 @.@ 8 to 5 trillion barrels ( 760 × 10 ^ 9 to 790 × 10 ^ 9 m3 ) of oil in place . 
 Heating oil shale to a sufficiently high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis to yield a vapor . Upon cooling the vapor , the liquid shale oil — an unconventional oil — is separated from combustible oil @-@ shale gas ( the term shale gas can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales ) . Oil shale can also be burned directly in furnaces as a low @-@ grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as a raw material in chemical and construction @-@ materials processing . 
 Oil shale gains attention as a potential abundant source of oil whenever the price of crude oil rises . At the same time , oil @-@ shale mining and processing raise a number of environmental concerns , such as land use , waste disposal , water use , waste @-@ water management , greenhouse @-@ gas emissions and air pollution . Estonia and China have well @-@ established oil shale industries , and Brazil , Germany , and Russia also utilize oil shale . 
 General composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix , <unk> , and kerogen . Oil shales differ from oil @-@ bearing shales , shale deposits that contain petroleum ( tight oil ) that is sometimes produced from drilled wells . Examples of oil @-@ bearing shales are the Bakken Formation , Pierre Shale , Niobrara Formation , and Eagle Ford Formation . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Oil shale , an organic @-@ rich sedimentary rock , belongs to the group of sapropel fuels . It does not have a definite geological definition nor a specific chemical formula , and its seams do not always have discrete boundaries . Oil shales vary considerably in their mineral content , chemical composition , age , type of kerogen , and depositional history and not all oil shales would necessarily be classified as shales in the strict sense . According to the <unk> Adrian C. Hutton of the University of Wollongong , oil shales are not " geological nor geochemically distinctive rock but rather ' economic ' term . " Their common feature is low solubility in low @-@ boiling organic solvents and generation of liquid organic products on thermal decomposition . 
 Oil shale differs from bitumen @-@ impregnated rocks ( oil sands and petroleum reservoir rocks ) , humic coals and carbonaceous shale . While oil sands do originate from the biodegradation of oil , heat and pressure have not ( yet ) transformed the kerogen in oil shale into petroleum , that means that its maturation does not exceed early <unk> . 
 General composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix , <unk> , and kerogen . While the bitumen portion of oil shales is soluble in carbon disulfide , kerogen portion is insoluble in carbon disulfide and can contain iron , vanadium , nickel , molybdenum , and uranium . Oil shale contains a lower percentage of organic matter than coal . In commercial grades of oil shale the ratio of organic matter to mineral matter lies approximately between 0 @.@ 75 : 5 and 1 @.@ 5 : 5 . At the same time , the organic matter in oil shale has an atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon ( H / C ) approximately 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 8 times lower than for crude oil and about 1 @.@ 5 to 3 times higher than for coals . The organic components of oil shale derive from a variety of organisms , such as the remains of algae , spores , pollen , plant cuticles and corky fragments of herbaceous and woody plants , and cellular debris from other aquatic and land plants . Some deposits contain significant fossils ; Germany 's Messel Pit has the status of a Unesco World Heritage Site . The mineral matter in oil shale includes various fine @-@ grained silicates and carbonates . Inorganic matrix can contain quartz , feldspars , clays ( mainly illite and chlorite ) , carbonates ( calcite and dolomites ) , pyrite and some other minerals . 
 Geologists can classify oil shales on the basis of their composition as carbonate @-@ rich shales , siliceous shales , or <unk> shales . 
 Another classification , known as the van <unk> diagram , assigns kerogen types , depending on the hydrogen , carbon , and oxygen content of oil shales ' original organic matter . The most commonly used classification of oil shales , developed between 1987 and 1991 by Adrian C. Hutton , adapts petrographic terms from coal terminology . This classification designates oil shales as terrestrial , lacustrine ( lake @-@ bottom @-@ deposited ) , or marine ( ocean bottom @-@ deposited ) , based on the environment of the initial biomass deposit . Known oil shales are predominantly aquatic ( marine , lacustrine ) origin . Hutton 's classification scheme has proven useful in estimating the yield and composition of the extracted oil . 
 = = Resource = = 
 As source rocks for most conventional oil reservoirs , oil shale deposits are found in all world oil provinces , although most of them are too deep to be exploited economically . As with all oil and gas resources , analysts distinguish between oil shale resources and oil shale reserves . " Resources " refers to all oil shale deposits , while " reserves " , represents those deposits from which producers can extract oil shale economically using existing technology . Since extraction technologies develop continuously , planners can only estimate the amount of recoverable kerogen . Although resources of oil shale occur in many countries , only 33 countries possess known deposits of possible economic value . Well @-@ explored deposits , potentially classifiable as reserves , include the Green River deposits in the western United States , the Tertiary deposits in Queensland , Australia , deposits in Sweden and Estonia , the El @-@ Lajjun deposit in Jordan , and deposits in France , Germany , Brazil , China , southern Mongolia and Russia . These deposits have given rise to expectations of yielding at least 40 liters of shale oil per tonne of oil shale , using the Fischer Assay . 
 A 2008 estimate set the total world resources of oil shale at 689 gigatons — equivalent to yield of 4 @.@ 8 trillion barrels ( 760 billion cubic metres ) of shale oil , with the largest reserves in the United States , which is thought to have 3 @.@ 7 trillion barrels ( 590 billion cubic metres ) , though only a part of it is recoverable . According to the 2010 World Energy Outlook by the International Energy Agency , the world oil shale resources may be equivalent of more than 5 trillion barrels ( 790 billion cubic metres ) of oil in place of which more than 1 trillion barrels ( 160 billion cubic metres ) may be technically recoverable . For comparison , the world 's proven conventional oil reserves were estimated at 1 @.@ 317 trillion barrels ( 209 @.@ 4 × 10 ^ 9 m3 ) , as of 1 January 2007 . The largest deposits in the world occur in the United States in the Green River Formation , which covers portions of Colorado , Utah , and Wyoming ; about 70 % of this resource lies on land owned or managed by the United States federal government . Deposits in the United States constitute 62 % of world resources ; together , the United States , Russia and Brazil account for 86 % of the world 's resources in terms of shale @-@ oil content . These figures remain tentative , with exploration or analysis of several deposits still outstanding . Professor Alan R. Carroll of University of Wisconsin – Madison regards the Upper Permian lacustrine oil @-@ shale deposits of northwest China , absent from previous global oil shale assessments , as comparable in size to the Green River Formation . 
 = = History = = 
 Humans have used oil shale as a fuel since prehistoric times , since it generally burns without any processing . Britons of the Iron Age also used to polish it and form it into ornaments . The first patent for extracting oil from oil shale was British Crown Patent 330 granted in 1694 to three persons named Martin <unk> , Thomas Hancock and William Portlock who had " found a way to extract and make great quantities of pitch , tarr , and <unk> out of a sort of stone . " 
 Modern industrial mining of oil shale began in 1837 in Autun , France , followed by exploitation in Scotland , Germany , and several other countries . 
 Operations during the 19th century focused on the production of kerosene , lamp oil , and paraffin ; these products helped supply the growing demand for lighting that arose during the Industrial Revolution . Fuel oil , lubricating oil and grease , and ammonium sulfate were also produced . The European oil @-@ shale industry expanded immediately before World War I due to limited access to conventional petroleum resources and to the mass production of automobiles and trucks , which accompanied an increase in gasoline consumption . 
 Although the Estonian and Chinese oil @-@ shale industries continued to grow after World War II , most other countries abandoned their projects due to high processing costs and the availability of cheaper petroleum . Following the 1973 oil crisis , world production of oil shale reached a peak of 46 million tonnes in 1980 before falling to about 16 million tonnes in 2000 , due to competition from cheap conventional petroleum in the 1980s . 
 On 2 May 1982 , known in some circles as " Black Sunday " , Exxon canceled its US $ 5 billion Colony Shale Oil Project near Parachute , Colorado because of low oil @-@ prices and increased expenses , laying off more than 2 @,@ 000 workers and leaving a trail of home @-@ foreclosures and small @-@ business bankruptcies . In 1986 , President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 which among other things abolished the United States ' Synthetic Liquid Fuels Program . 
 The global oil @-@ shale industry began to revive at the beginning of the 21st century . In 2003 , an oil @-@ shale development program restarted in the United States . Authorities introduced a commercial leasing program permitting the extraction of oil shale and oil sands on federal lands in 2005 , in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 . 
 = = Industry = = 
 As of 2008 , industry uses oil shale in Brazil , China , Estonia and to some extent in Germany , and Russia . Several additional countries started assessing their reserves or had built experimental production plants , while others had phased out their oil shale industry . Oil shale serves for oil production in Estonia , Brazil , and China ; for power generation in Estonia , China , and Germany ; for cement production in Estonia , Germany , and China ; and for use in chemical industries in China , Estonia , and Russia . 
 As of 2009 , 80 % of oil shale used globally is extracted in Estonia , mainly due to the Oil @-@ shale @-@ fired power plants . Oil @-@ shale @-@ fired power plants occur in Estonia , which has an installed capacity of 2 @,@ 967 megawatts ( MW ) , China ( 12 MW ) , and Germany ( 9 @.@ 9 MW ) . Israel , Romania and Russia have in the past run power plants fired by oil shale , but have shut them down or switched to other fuel sources such as natural gas . Jordan and Egypt plan to construct power plants fired by oil shale , while Canada and Turkey plan to burn oil shale along with coal for power generation . Oil shale serves as the main fuel for power generation only in Estonia , where the oil @-@ shale @-@ fired Narva Power Plants accounted for 95 % of country 's electrical generation in 2005 . 
 According to the World Energy Council , in 2008 the total production of shale oil from oil shale was 930 @,@ 000 tonnes , equal to 17 @,@ 700 barrels per day ( 2 @,@ 810 m3 / d ) , of which China produced 375 @,@ 000 tonnes , Estonia 355 @,@ 000 tonnes , and Brazil 200 @,@ 000 tonnes . In comparison , production of the conventional oil and natural gas liquids in 2008 amounted 3 @.@ 95 billion tonnes or 82 @.@ 1 million barrels per day ( 13 @.@ 1 × 10 ^ 6 m3 / d ) . 
 = = Extraction and processing = = 
 Most exploitation of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere , after which one can burn the shale directly to generate electricity , or undertake further processing . The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining . These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale , and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface . Underground mining of oil shale , which removes less of the overlying material , employs the room @-@ and @-@ pillar method . 
 The extraction of the useful components of oil shale usually takes place above ground ( ex @-@ situ processing ) , although several newer technologies perform this underground ( on @-@ site or in @-@ situ processing ) . In either case , the chemical process of pyrolysis converts the kerogen in the oil shale to shale oil ( synthetic crude oil ) and oil shale gas . Most conversion technologies involve heating shale in the absence of oxygen to a temperature at which kerogen decomposes ( <unk> ) into gas , condensable oil , and a solid residue . This usually takes place between 450 ° C ( 842 ° F ) and 500 ° C ( 932 ° F ) . The process of decomposition begins at relatively low temperatures ( 300 ° C or 572 ° F ) , but proceeds more rapidly and more completely at higher temperatures . 
 In @-@ situ processing involves heating the oil shale underground . Such technologies can potentially extract more oil from a given area of land than ex @-@ situ processes , since they can access the material at greater depths than surface mines can . Several companies have patented methods for in @-@ situ retorting . However , most of these methods remain in the experimental phase . One can distinguish true in @-@ situ processes ( TIS ) and modified in @-@ situ processes ( MIS ) . True in @-@ situ processes do not involve mining the oil shale . Modified in @-@ situ processes involve removing part of the oil shale and bringing it to the surface for modified in @-@ situ retorting in order to create permeability for gas flow in a rubble chimney . Explosives <unk> the oil @-@ shale deposit . 
 Hundreds of patents for oil shale retorting technologies exist ; however , only a few dozen have undergone testing . By 2006 , only four technologies remained in commercial use : Kiviter , Galoter , Fushun , and Petrosix . 
 = = Applications and products = = 
 Industry can use oil shale as a fuel for thermal power @-@ plants , burning it ( like coal ) to drive steam turbines ; some of these plants employ the resulting heat for district heating of homes and businesses . In addition to its use as a fuel , oil shale may also serve in the production of specialty carbon fibers , adsorbent carbons , carbon black , phenols , resins , glues , tanning agents , <unk> , road bitumen , cement , bricks , construction and decorative blocks , soil @-@ additives , fertilizers , rock @-@ wool insulation , glass , and pharmaceutical products . However , oil shale use for production of these items remains small or only in its experimental stages . Some oil shales yield sulfur , ammonia , alumina , soda ash , uranium , and nahcolite as shale @-@ oil extraction byproducts . Between 1946 and 1952 , a marine type of <unk> shale served for uranium production in Sillamäe , Estonia , and between 1950 and 1989 Sweden used alum shale for the same purposes . Oil shale gas has served as a substitute for natural gas , but as of 2009 , producing oil shale gas as a natural @-@ gas substitute remained economically infeasible . 
 The shale oil derived from oil shale does not directly substitute for crude oil in all applications . It may contain higher concentrations of olefins , oxygen , and nitrogen than conventional crude oil . Some shale oils may have higher sulfur or arsenic content . By comparison with West Texas Intermediate , the benchmark standard for crude oil in the futures @-@ contract market , the Green River shale oil sulfur content ranges from near 0 % to 4 @.@ 9 % ( in average 0 @.@ 76 % ) , where West Texas Intermediate 's sulfur content has a maximum of 0 @.@ 42 % . The sulfur content in shale oil from Jordan 's oil shales may rise even up to 9 @.@ 5 % . The arsenic content , for example , becomes an issue for Green River formation oil shale . The higher concentrations of these materials means that the oil must undergo considerable upgrading ( <unk> ) before serving as oil @-@ refinery feedstock . Above @-@ ground retorting processes tended to yield a lower API gravity shale oil than the in situ processes . Shale oil serves best for producing middle @-@ distillates such as kerosene , jet fuel , and diesel fuel . Worldwide demand for these middle distillates , particularly for diesel fuels , increased rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s . However , appropriate refining processes equivalent to hydrocracking can transform shale oil into a lighter @-@ range hydrocarbon ( gasoline ) . 
 = = Economics = = 
 The amount of economically recoverable oil shale is unknown . The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the cost of shale @-@ oil production in a given region comes in below the price of crude oil or its other substitutes . According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation , the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the United States ( comprising a mine , retorting plant , upgrading plant , supporting utilities , and spent shale reclamation ) , would range between US $ 70 – 95 ( $ 440 – 600 / m3 , adjusted to 2005 values ) . This estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency . In order to run a profitable operation , the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels . The analysis also discusses the expectation that processing costs would drop after the establishment of the complex . The hypothetical unit would see a cost reduction of 35 – 70 % after producing its first 500 million barrels ( 79 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) . Assuming an increase in output of 25 thousand barrels per day ( 4 @.@ 0 × 10 ^ 3 m3 / d ) during each year after the start of commercial production , RAND predicts the costs would decline to $ 35 – 48 per barrel ( $ 220 – 300 / m3 ) within 12 years . After achieving the milestone of 1 billion barrels ( 160 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) , its costs would decline further to $ 30 – 40 per barrel ( $ 190 – 250 / m3 ) . Some commentators compare the proposed American oil @-@ shale industry to the Athabasca oil @-@ sands industry ( the latter enterprise generated over 1 million barrels ( 160 @,@ 000 m3 ) of oil per day in late 2007 ) , stating that " the first @-@ generation facility is the hardest , both technically and economically " . 
 In 2005 , Royal Dutch Shell announced that its in @-@ situ process could become competitive for oil prices over $ 30 per barrel ( $ 190 / m3 ) . A 2004 report by the United States Department of Energy stated that both the Shell technology and technology used in the Stuart Oil Shale Project could be competitive at prices above $ 25 per barrel , and that the Viru Keemia Grupp expected full @-@ scale production to be economical at prices above $ 18 per barrel ( $ 130 / m3 ) . 
 To increase efficiency when retorting oil shale , researchers have proposed and tested several co @-@ pyrolysis processes . 
 A 1972 publication in the journal <unk> Informations ( ISSN <unk> @-@ <unk> ) compared shale @-@ based oil production unfavorably with coal liquefaction . The article portrayed coal liquefaction as less expensive , generating more oil , and creating fewer environmental impacts than extraction from oil shale . It cited a conversion ratio of 650 liters ( 170 U.S. gal ; 140 imp gal ) of oil per one ton of coal , as against 150 liters ( 40 U.S. gal ; 33 imp gal ) of shale oil per one ton of oil shale . 
 A critical measure of the viability of oil shale as an energy source lies in the ratio of the energy produced by the shale to the energy used in its mining and processing , a ratio known as " Energy Returned on Energy Invested " ( EROEI ) . A 1984 study estimated the EROEI of the various known oil @-@ shale deposits as varying between 0 @.@ 7 – 13 @.@ 3 although known oil @-@ shale extraction development projects assert an EROEI between 3 and 10 . According to the World Energy Outlook 2010 , the EROEI of ex @-@ situ processing is typically 4 to 5 while of in @-@ situ processing it may be even as low as 2 . However , according to the IEA most of used energy can be provided by burning the spent shale or oil @-@ shale gas . 
 The water needed in the oil shale retorting process offers an additional economic consideration : this may pose a problem in areas with water scarcity . 
 = = Environmental considerations = = 
 Mining oil shale involves a number of environmental impacts , more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining . These include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials , the introduction of metals including mercury into surface @-@ water and groundwater , increased erosion , sulfur @-@ gas emissions , and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing , transport , and support activities . In 2002 , about 97 % of air pollution , 86 % of total waste and 23 % of water pollution in Estonia came from the power industry , which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production . 
 Oil @-@ shale extraction can damage the biological and recreational value of land and the ecosystem in the mining area . Combustion and thermal processing generate waste material . In addition , the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and combustion include carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas . Environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale , as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels . Section 526 of the Energy Independence And Security Act prohibits United States government agencies from buying oil produced by processes that produce more greenhouse gas emissions than would traditional petroleum . Experimental in situ conversion processes and carbon capture and storage technologies may reduce some of these concerns in the future , but at the same time they may cause other problems , including groundwater pollution . Among the water contaminants commonly associated with oil shale processing are oxygen and nitrogen heterocyclic hydrocarbons . Commonly detected examples include quinoline derivatives , pyridine , and various alkyl homologues of pyridine ( <unk> , <unk> ) . 
 Some have expressed concerns over the oil shale industry 's use of water . In 2002 , the oil shale @-@ fired power industry used 91 % of the water consumed in Estonia . Depending on technology , above @-@ ground retorting uses between one and five barrels of water per barrel of produced shale @-@ oil . A 2008 programmatic environmental impact statement issued by the US Bureau of Land Management stated that surface mining and retort operations produce 2 to 10 U.S. gallons ( 7 @.@ 6 to 37 @.@ 9 l ; 1 @.@ 7 to 8 @.@ 3 imp gal ) of waste water per 1 short ton ( 0 @.@ 91 t ) of processed oil shale . In situ processing , according to one estimate , uses about one @-@ tenth as much water . 
 Water concerns become particularly sensitive issues in arid regions , such as the western US and Israel 's Negev Desert , where plans exist to expand oil @-@ shale extraction despite a water shortage . 
 Environmental activists , including members of Greenpeace , have organized strong protests against the oil shale industry . In one result , Queensland Energy Resources put the proposed Stuart Oil Shale Project in Australia on hold in 2004 .

 = Selle Français = 
 The Selle Français ( SF ) is a breed of sport horse from France . It is renowned primarily for its success in show jumping , but many have also been successful in dressage and eventing . An athletic horse with good gaits , it is usually bay or chestnut in color . The Selle Français was created in 1958 when several French riding horse breeds were merged into one stud book . The new breed was meant to serve as a unified sport horse during a period when horses were being replaced by mechanization and were transforming into an animal used mainly for sport and leisure . 
 Bred throughout France , the Selle Français has been exported worldwide , with additional stud books formed in Great Britain and the United States . Horses registered with the stud books must undergo inspections which judge their conformation , gaits and performance . Horses of other breeds who pass the inspections , including those of Thoroughbred , Arabian , Anglo @-@ Arabian and French Trotter bloodlines , may be used for breeding , with the progeny able to be registered as Selle Français . Selle Français have proven successful at the international level of competition in many equestrian disciplines . They are most commonly seen in show jumping , eventing and dressage , although they are also seen in combined driving , equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding competitions . Selle Français and their riders have won numerous medals in the Summer Olympics and World Equestrian Games , including making up the entire gold @-@ medal French teams in show jumping at the 2002 World Equestrian Games and eventing at the 2004 Summer Olympics . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 Because of the diversity of the breeds that contributed to the Selle Français , there are not set breed standards . It can range from 15 @.@ 1 to 17 @.@ 3 hands ( 61 to 71 inches , 155 to 180 cm ) , although , because they are used as sport horses , most Selle Français usually stand a relatively tall 16 @.@ 1 to 16 @.@ 3 hands ( 65 to 67 inches , 165 to 170 cm ) . It is an athletic horse with balanced , harmonious and powerful gaits . Some morphological traits remain the same throughout the breed . The forehead is broad , and the facial profile is straight or convex . The neck is strong and rather long , well connected to the withers , and the back straight . The croup is elongated , muscular and slightly oblique , and the powerful hindquarters are an asset in show jumping . The chest is deep , and the shoulders long and sloping . The legs are strong and muscular with wide joints and hard hooves . 
 The Selle Français is generally bay or chestnut in color , the latter being a legacy of its origins in the Anglo @-@ Norman breed . Gray is much less common , with its origins in the Thoroughbred and Anglo @-@ Arabian horses that contributed to the breed . White markings , such as white on the lower legs , are fairly common within the breed , and are again inherited from its Norman ancestors . The temperament of the Selle Français is highly variable from one horse to another . This is due to the selection criteria for breeding stock , which since the beginning of the breed have been based on physical ability . In recent years , however , the ANSF and breeders have been working to create selection criteria that focus on temperament . The vast majority of Selle Français have good temperaments , quiet but energetic , patient and friendly . The breed is reputed to be intelligent and quick to learn . 
 = = History = = 
 The origins of the Selle Français begin with native French horses . In 19th century Normandy , native mares were crossbred with Thoroughbred or Norfolk Trotter stallions . The most common crosses were between native mares used by the military , or those bred for pulling carriages , and Thoroughbred stallions . In 1914 these types were recognized as demi @-@ sang or " half @-@ blood " horses . Half @-@ blood horses were found in many French regions , and different types were usually named after the regions in which they were bred . The three main types of French saddle horses were the Anglo @-@ Norman ( bred around Caen ) , the demi @-@ sang du Centre ( bred around Cluny ) and the <unk> ( bred around La Roche @-@ sur @-@ Yon ) . 
 In 1958 , " Selle Français " or French Saddle Horse was created by merging the all of the regional half @-@ blood horses in France under one name . The merged types included the Anglo @-@ Norman , the Charolais ( from the Charolles region ) , and the <unk> . The merger was done to create a sport horse that would meet the needs of a mechanized society where horses were used for leisure and sport . The first Selle Français were not homogeneous in type , but offered a wide genetic diversity , due to the wide variety of local horses crossed with Thoroughbreds , Anglo @-@ Arabians and French Trotters . Norman origins , however , were the most widely represented , as the Anglo @-@ Norman had been used for breeding throughout France . 
 Since its creation as a breed , the Selle Français has been selected solely as a sport horse . Because of this , the breed has homogenized and refined , and since its creation has been a successful competitor in international equestrian sport . In July 2003 , the Association nationale du selle français ( ANSF or National Association of French Saddle Horses ) was approved as the breed association . The ANSF plays an advocacy role with stakeholders and partners in the equine world and ensures a proper orientation of selection and genetic improvement within the breed . Breeding of Selle Français is centered in Normandy , mainly due to its origins in Norman @-@ related bloodlines . As of 2009 , there were 7 @,@ 722 farms that reported breeding activity of Selle Français , although the vast majority ( around 77 percent ) were very small operations with only one mare . In 2008 , there were 7 @,@ 638 Selle Français foals born , which made up 57 percent of the total saddle horses bred in France . In 2009 , over 13 @,@ 500 Selle Français mares were bred , of which 11 @,@ 830 were mated to approved stallions to produce Selle Français offspring . In the same year , there were 505 active Selle Français stallions . 
 The Selle Français is bred throughout France and abroad , and artificial insemination plays an important role in the dissemination of the breed . The Selle Français has also contributed to several other breeds in Europe , including the Holsteiner , <unk> and Oldenburg warmblood breeds . The ANSF has branches in several countries . The United Kingdom organization , called <unk> , led to the opening of a British stud book for the Selle Français , and the ANSF @-@ US manages the stud book for the breed in the United States . Brazil , Argentina and Morocco have agreements with the French stud book to register horses bred in those countries . 
 = = Registration and stud book selection = = 
 The Selle Français stud book has long allowed crossbreeding with four other breeds : the Thoroughbred , Arabian , Anglo @-@ Arabian and French Trotter . Today , restrictions exist to harmonize the stud book with directives for other European warmblood breeds . For a Selle Français to be registered , it must be from two registered Selle Français parents or from a cross between a Selle Français and a facteur de selle français ( non @-@ Selle Français horse that has passed stud book selection procedures ) . Stallions must pass through a selection process before their progeny is allowed to be registered as Selle Français . The process involves an approval committee that judges stallions on criteria based on the age , breed and nationality of the horses . The qualification criteria involve the conformation , gaits , performance and are scored against national indices . 
 Mares can be of several origins and be listed as facteur de selle français . Thoroughbred , AQPS , pure or crossbred Anglo @-@ Arabians and French Trotting horses may also qualify under this designation , as do mares that are the product of two facteur de selle français horses . Mares belonging to other saddle horse breeds recognized by the European Union ( EU ) are also listed in this category . Pure and crossbred Arabians , saddle breeds not recognized by the EU and some other mares may be listed on an individual basis by performing at a high level in show jumping , three @-@ day eventing or dressage competition . If mares come from countries or territories that do not have access to high @-@ level competitions , they may be granted special listing status . 
 In 2003 , the stud book was divided into two parts : a section for pure Selle Français from two registered parents and a section for horses with one facteur de selle français parent . In 2009 , this distinction was abandoned and the two sections were recombined into a single stud book .

 The Selle Français is a French sport horse , now recognized internationally as a top breed for show jumping and three @-@ day eventing . Selection criteria for breeding stock focuses on their jumping abilities . Show jumping is a technical sport , calling for lively and responsive yet powerful horses . Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three @-@ day eventing , where speed and stamina are needed to be successful in all three portions ( dressage , three @-@ day eventing and show jumping ) of the event . Thanks to these qualities , the Selle Français is seen on international show jumping and three @-@ day eventing teams , both in France and elsewhere . In dressage , the Selle Français has gradually improved , but has faced stiff competition from northern European breeds , which often have more active gaits . In addition , many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show jumping , which sometimes deprives the dressage system of good horses . The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses ( <unk> ) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in eventing , show jumping and dressage . In 2013 , the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show jumping stud book in the world , topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds , and a Selle Français horse was ranked first in the world . The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in eventing , with the top horse placed at 25th . The ANSF was ranked 19th in dressage , beaten by many of the more popular dressage breeds , including Dutch Warmbloods , Hanoverians and <unk> . 
 The Institut français du cheval et de l 'équitation ( French Institute of Horse Riding ) , the École nationale d 'équitation ( National Riding School ) and the Cadre Noir all use mainly Selle Français . Young horses are selected according to their skills and are trained by students within the schools . Horses representing the Cadre Noir are selected at the age of three and are trained according to their abilities , with some reaching the highest levels of haute <unk> dressage . Selle Français are also used for combined driving , equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding , and have competed at the international level in all three sports . 
 Selle Français are also used for the production of race horses in France . By crossbreeding them with Thoroughbred and Anglo @-@ Arabians , horses are produced which are competitive in steeplechase ( racing over obstacles ) . These horses are generally registered as AQPS ( meaning " other than Thoroughbred " ) in France . The AQPS studbook in France was created in 2005 ; before this , some successful French racehorses , especially those raced in steeplechase races , were registered as Selle Français . These include Neptune Collonges , winner of the 2012 Grand National race , and <unk> .

 <unk> Z ( 1966 – 1991 ) , while not a successful international competitor himself , was a sire of huge importance to the international show jumping world . Among his numerous successful progeny was I Love You ( a World Cup winner ) and <unk> A ( 1972 – 2005 ) , part of the gold @-@ medal winning French show @-@ jumping team at the World Championships in 1982 . <unk> A , in turn , is known for both his competition career and the success of his offspring . He is the sire of <unk> du Rouet ( b . 1989 ) , who with rider Rodrigo Pessoa won the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and was a three @-@ time winner of the World Cup . 
 Flambeau C ( b . 1971 ) became a pillar of the French show jumping team in the 1980s . He participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics , where he took 7th individually , and the 1988 Summer Olympics , winning the bronze medal with the French team . The 1980s also saw the rise of <unk> ( 1975 – 1991 ) , a small black horse with a conformation and gaits that were considered disadvantageous for show jumping . Despite this , he had an impressive jumping style , and won two French championships in 1982 and 1986 , a European championship in 1987 , several team medals at the European and World Championships , and a gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics with rider Pierre Durand , Jr . 
 In the 1990s , several Selle Français rose to prominence in international competition . <unk> de Revel ( b . 1982 ) , was on the French bronze medal winning show jumping team at the 1992 Summer Olympics , ridden by Hervé <unk> , and Quito de <unk> ( b . 1982 ) was a European champion , world champion and another member of the French team in 1992 , ridden by Éric <unk> . <unk> Rouge ( 1983 – 2008 ) was a show jumping European champion in 1999 and an individual bronze medalist at the 1996 Summer Olympics . The 2000s saw Selle Français among the world leaders in both show jumping and three @-@ day eventing . Four stallions made up the champion show jumping team at the 2002 World Equestrian Games , while four more Selle Francais made up the winning three @-@ day event team at the 2004 Summer Olympics . In 2003 , a Selle Francais became the European champion in vaulting , and another was named the world champion in competitive trail riding . The Selle Français continued to lead international show jumping competitions in the 2010s , with Swiss rider Steve <unk> riding a member of the breed to individual gold at the 2012 Summer Olympics .

 Patient Zero ( Clarence Williams III ) tries to hail a taxi on a busy street , but is continually ignored . He is eventually picked up by Gerome Knox ( Ricky Harris ) , but suffers a seizure in the back of the taxi , raving about a threat against his life . Knox takes him to hospital , where he is diagnosed as a drug addict . Zero is sedated , but becomes agitated when two men enter the hospital lobby ; Knox helps him escape , believing his life is in danger . The two men , Wright and Patterson , quarantine the area , as Zero is carrying a highly contagious disease . 
 Millennium Group member Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) is contacted for help in finding Zero , and travels to a briefing on the situation . It is explained that Zero is carrying a disease ordinarily confined to the Congo . Meanwhile , Zero and Knox are attempting to have a local newspaper run Zero 's story , believing he has been infected in a racially motivated conspiracy akin to the Tuskegee syphilis experiment . Police locate and apprehend Zero , who manages to smear blood on Black 's shirt . 
 Black has the blood tested , and finds it free of any pathogen ; meanwhile , the government center running the earlier briefing has vanished . Black realizes he was tricked into finding Zero for an ulterior motive , eventually learning that the organisation responsible is carrying out medical experiments on the homeless , and may be tied to the Millennium Group . Elsewhere a homeless man , acting similarly to Zero , attacks two policemen , and is killed in response . Black and fellow Group member Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) investigate , but are clearly not welcome . Black manages to obtain a blood sample from the dead man , and finds a stretcher tag which he believes is connected to the United States Department of Energy . 
 Further examination of the blood of both Zero and the dead man reveal that their condition has been induced through gene therapy . Watts and Black theorize that the DOE is developing a biological weapon which would incite violence and rioting in a targeted population ; they learn that the research is being conducted by scientists involved in the Human Genome Project . Later , the body of Knox is found at a nearby morgue . Later , Black and Watts , assisted by local police , raid an office building connected to the project , which they believe is using homeless shelters to test their pathogen . They hope to recover Zero in the raid , but find him cogent and working for the project — his real name is Dr. William Kramer , and he denies any knowledge of the incident . Black believes Kramer was accidentally infected during his work , and finds a photograph in the man 's office , showing him in military uniform , taking part in the 1994 Rwandan Genocide .

 " Sense and Antisense " was written by Chip Johannessen , who went on to write a total of twelve episodes across all three seasons , including the series ' final episode , " Goodbye to All That " . The episode was directed by Thomas J. Wright ; Wright had directed six episodes previously and would helm a further nineteen over the series ' run . Wright would also go on to direct " Millennium " , the series ' crossover episode with its sister show The X @-@ Files . 
 Johannessen was ultimately unhappy with how the episode turned out , believing that it suffered as a result of frequent re @-@ writes to the script . Johannessen 's original draft focused more heavily on racial issues , which Fox 's broadcast standards office objected to . The episode makes use of Bobby Darin 's song " Gyp the Cat " in a diegetic manner .

 = Peggle = 
 Peggle is a casual puzzle video game developed by <unk> Sidhu and Brian Rothstein of PopCap Games . Initially released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X systems in 2007 , it has since had versions released for Xbox Live Arcade , PlayStation Network , the Nintendo DS ( with the help of Q Entertainment ) , Windows Mobile , iOS , Zeebo and Android ; the game has also been ported as a Java application , and an extended minigame incorporated into the massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft . A sequel was released in September 2008 , titled Peggle Nights . 
 Inspired by pachinko and bagatelle , each level of Peggle challenges the player to shoot a limited supply of balls at a field of colored pegs to clear out specifically marked pegs while attempting to achieve a high score through skilled shot planning . Special powers associated with a number of cartoon " Peggle Masters " can be activated to aid the player in this task . Peggle initially sold slowly but was boosted by the inclusion of a specially designed demonstration in Valve 's The Orange Box , and has since enjoyed over 50 million downloads from the Internet . Both its release on Xbox Live Arcade and iOS have enjoyed similar success . PopCap , now a subsidiary of Electronic Arts , have announced Peggle 2 at the E3 2013 convention . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Within the game 's main " Adventure " mode , Peggle is divided into fifty @-@ five levels . Each level features an arrangement of approximately one hundred blue " pegs " , positioned to correspond with the level 's background picture , inside of three walls on the top and sides ( leaving the bottom opened ) , along with other fixed and moving features . The goal of each level is to clear the board of the twenty @-@ five random pegs that are turned orange at the start of the level , by using a ball launcher located at the top center of the screen to strike one or more of the pegs . <unk> light up when hit , and once the ball either falls through the bottom of the screen or is caught by the ball catcher that moves back and forth along the bottom in a fixed manner , the pegs will be removed . Struck pegs are also removed if the ball is stuck on them . The player begins each level with ten balls ( twelve on the non @-@ Touch iPod version ) to clear the orange pegs , but may earn more by landing the ball in the ball catcher , or by earning high scores on single shots . Failure to clear the board with the allotted number of balls will require the player to restart the level , while completing this objective will allow the player to progress forward to the next board . 
 Every five levels in the Adventure mode correspond to playing with one of ten " Peggle Masters " , cartoon characters that help the player . Each of the Peggle Masters has a unique special ability that is activated when the player strikes one of the two randomly selected green pegs on the board . Some abilities activate immediately ; one ability causes a second ball to be generated from the green peg when struck . Other abilities will have effects that activate on the next shot or for several more shots ; one ability shows the ball 's path including rebounds , while another will extend the length of the ball catcher . In the final five levels of the Adventure mode , called " Master " levels , the player can select which of the Peggle Masters they want to use . 
 In addition to clearing the board , the player is challenged to get high scores with each shot . Points come from two main sources : striking pegs , and style points . Each struck peg earns points , with further bonuses gained by hitting numerous pegs on a single shot , and by clearing orange pegs , which builds up a scoring multiplier up to 10x when all but a few orange pegs remain . Additionally , for each shot , one random blue peg will be marked purple and revert to blue after the shot if it is not struck ; striking this peg will further boost the player 's score . Style points are awarded for making difficult shots such as striking two orange pegs consecutively that are a distance apart , or by getting lucky bounces off the ball catcher . When the player clears the board of orange pegs , as announced by the song " Ode To Joy " and the message " Extreme Fever " , the bottom of the level is replaced with five bins of different point values that the ball will fall into . The player is awarded this score in addition to any unused balls remaining to get their final score for the level . If all the pegs on a level are cleared , a bonus is awarded and all the bins turn to the maximum value and the message " Ultra Extreme Fever " is displayed . 
 In addition to the Adventure mode , the game features a series of challenges that require the player to complete boards under stricter requirements , such as having to clear more orange pegs or remove every peg from the board . A " Duel " mode allows the player to compete against another person or a computer AI on the same board in attempting to reach the highest score . The Xbox Live and PlayStation Network versions add a " Peg Party " mode , in which up to four players compete on their own boards using a limited number of balls , each attempting to get the highest score . In each of these modes , the game generally offers the ability for players to select which Peggle Master they wish to use . 
 = = Development = = 
 Peggle was originally envisioned by PopCap 's studio director , <unk> Sidhu , who was inspired by pachinko machines . However , he recognized that pachinko was mostly luck @-@ based , and would not translate well into a video game . After seeing a 2D game engine created by PopCap programmer Brian Rothstein , Sidhu was able to realize his game , and worked with Rothstein for the first five months of its development before bringing in additional programmers . Initial designs focused on bringing together elements of pachinko with Breakout . The team initially incorporated a " rapid @-@ fire " mechanic used in pachinko , along with numerous moving targets , but they found this made the levels either too fast @-@ paced or too demanding of the player . They found over time that a static field of pegs provided a more enjoyable experience for the player ; the path of the ball would be more predictable , leading to the gameplay mechanic of requiring only a random subset of orange pegs to be cleared . Once the team had established the core mechanics of the game , they brought on character artist Walter Wilson , background artist Marcia Broderick and an additional coder , Eric Tams , to help complete Peggle within its two @-@ year development period . Even with their game established , Sidhu and Rothstein faced internal challenges at PopCap to increase the level of interactivity with the game , but the two defended their vision of the game . 
 The design team struggled with a theme for the game , and for a while the game was based around the <unk> god Thor . During this time the game was called Thunderball and was much darker in theme than the final product . Eventually the game changed themes to be more lighthearted and the team realized that the name no longer fit the game . From there the designers came up with calling the game " <unk> " and then " Pogo " . The team later discovered that , since Pogo was already the name of EA 's Flash portal they wouldn 't be able to use it . 
 Though the game was technically completed within a year , PopCap opted to spend more time to polish it , improving the visuals and background images . The team spent time refining the various sound effects used in the game , in order to provide an appropriate atmosphere . In some cases , they found the desired sound quickly ; the sound of the ball hitting a peg was borrowed from another game in development at PopCap , but was considered perfect for Peggle . Other cases required iteration ; the sound of the ball shooter was originally closer to that of a cannon , while a " plunk " sound effect was used when the ball catcher caught a ball . These were changed to more airy sounds ( an air cannon and a brief angelic chorus ) in order to make the elements sound as if part of the game 's music . The team found it helped to create a defining moment at the end of each level when the player is moments from clearing the final peg . This initially was programmed as a simple message stating " Extreme Fever " and the music of Ode to Joy as a placeholder . Sidhu wanted to recreate the " wild sounds and visuals " that were present on winning pachinko games . However , the team found that the players reacted well to the simpler placeholder elements , and the team focused on improving the presentation of these , including adding a zoom on the current ball as it neared the last orange peg to be cleared . 
 = = Versions and sequels = = 
 Peggle Extreme was packaged with the Windows version of The Orange Box , featuring levels inspired by Half @-@ Life 2 , Team Fortress 2 , and Portal . It includes ten levels with one Peggle Master , and five Challenges . Peggle Extreme was eventually made free to download for anyone with a Steam account . The game was developed in conjunction with Valve Corporation after PopCap 's Tams learned that Peggle was played often at Valve 's offices and that the company had helped to promote the game on Steam . PopCap proposed a version that would pay tribute to Valve 's games , which Valve readily warmed up to , helping PopCap with its development , including providing graphical assets and artwork . 
 Peggle has been ported to Xbox Live Arcade , the PlayStation Network , the iPod , and iOS . The Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network versions includes the " Peg Party " mode in which up to four players can compete simultaneously . Both the Xbox Live Arcade , PlayStation Network and iOS versions include the " Duel " mode , with the iOS version having the players share the iPhone between turns . Peggle has also been ported as a minigame inside World of Warcraft , featuring levels based on the game , though including a limited set of Peggle Masters to use . Warcraft players can also use Peggle to decide how to distribute loot from successful raids or dungeons . Subsequently , in July 2009 , a free standalone , ten @-@ level edition of Peggle themed around Warcraft in a similar manner as Peggle Extreme was released . 
 PopCap released a sequel to the original game , Peggle Nights , in September 2008 for Windows . The sequel expands upon Peggle by adding one new Peggle Master in addition to new levels and challenges . The Xbox Live and PlayStation Network versions of Peggle received Nights as a downloadable expansion to the game on November 19 , 2009 . Peggle Nights was made available as an in @-@ app purchase for iOS devices . Peggle : Dual Shot is a Nintendo DS port of the game , developed by Q Entertainment ; the game includes content from both Peggle and Peggle Nights . This version of the game awards the player a star each time a purple bonus peg is hit , activating a new bonus minigame upon collecting five stars . The minigame requires that the player continually bounce a ball with pinball @-@ like bumpers to collect diamonds and extra balls .

 Peggle was well received by critics . Alec Meer of Eurogamer found the game to be a " constant series of rewards " in gameplay , graphics , and audio that would continue to satisfy the player . Gus Mastrapa of The A.V. Club considered the game " comfort food for the omnivorous gamer " , with its ability to draw even hardcore gamers into its fantasy visuals . IGN 's Erik Brudvig cited Peggle as being " simple enough for anybody to pick up and instantly start having fun " . The Xbox Live version was seen as truthful to the PC version , and while the Peggle Party mode was considered an interesting addition , Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer felt it was a " curiously remote approach " that did not fully integrate a multiplayer experience into the game , a point also stated by Mastrapa who lamented the lack of online leaderboards . 
 The game did not initially perform well in sales when released for Windows , but according to Sidhu , sales of the game took off following the release of Peggle Extreme as part of The Orange Box ; Sidhu stated that the special version of the game helped to bring in video game players that would " never be caught dead playing a game with unicorns and rainbows " . Peggle ( both trial and full versions ) has been downloaded more than 50 million times from the Internet as of early 2009 , though PopCap has not released how many of these downloads were for full sales of the game . 
 Upon its release on Xbox Live Arcade , Peggle was the top @-@ selling game on the service for two weeks , and remained in the top ten applications for several weeks afterward . Within a month , over 100 @,@ 000 players were listed on the Xbox leaderboards for Peggle , though this number also includes players who purchased the game through the PopCap Arcade Volume 2 retail package , which contained the game as well . IGN editor Cam Shea ranked it eighth on his top ten list of Xbox Live Arcade games . He stated that while its theme could easily turn players off , they should not let it , as it is " It 's infectious , and most importantly , fun " according to him . In a list compiled by the IGN staff in September 2010 , Peggle was listed as the 10th best Xbox Live Arcade of all time . 
 The release of Peggle on iOS was extremely popular , placing in the top ten applications purchased through the App Store for the first two weeks it was available . During a weekend in June 2009 , the title was put on sale for $ 1 ( normally $ 5 ) ; the sale caused the game to become the most purchased application in the App Store . A PopCap representative stated that they made as many sales during this four @-@ day period as they had in the three weeks prior , after the game 's launch on the Store . 
 Peggle is considered to be an addictive game . The game is stated to have a simple premise that follows the KISS principle , but requires some amount of repeating playing to master , similar in fashion to early arcade games , leading to its addictive qualities . Peggle is also claimed to entice the user to play " just a few more minutes " . The accessibility of the game across multiple platforms is also considered to contribute to its addictiveness . MSNBC named Peggle one of the " Top 5 most addictive computer games of all time . " Despite its addictive nature , the game , like many of PopCap 's casual games , is also considered a stress reliever . A study underwritten by PopCap at East Carolina University found that across 132 subjects , Peggle was found to increase their mood by 573 % across all subjects , with a 45 % reduction in depression . Peggle along with other PopCap games were also found to help children with ADHD improve their attention span and memory recall , in a survey done by Information Solutions Group on behalf of PopCap . 
 Peggle was nominated for the 2007 Game Developers Choice Awards for " Best Downloadable Game " , " Best Handheld Game " ( for the iPod port ) , and " Innovation " awards . The game was also nominated as the " Best Downloadable Game " for the 2007 Interactive Achievement Awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences . Peggle appeared as # 40 on the 2007 PC Gamer Magazine ( UK ) list of their 100 favorite computer games of all time . 
 = Hurricane Otis ( 2005 ) = 
 Hurricane Otis was a moderate hurricane that threatened the Baja California Peninsula but dissipated before landfall . Otis developed on September 28 , 2005 , off the western coast of Mexico , from a tropical wave that emerged from the western coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean during the preceding several weeks . After attaining tropical storm status on September 29 , the storm moved in a generally northwestward direction for most of its duration . It ultimately peaked at Category 2 intensity on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale before beginning to weaken . The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on October 3 and dissipated fully on October 5 , near the coast of Baja California Sur . Preparations for the storm were completed on the Peninsula ; tropical cyclone watches and warnings were declared and numerous shelters opened . However , the storm 's effects were minimal , and limited to gusty winds with heavy rainfall . No major damage was reported . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Otis are believed to have been in a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on September 9 . The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean , spawning Tropical Depression Seventeen on September 17 . The southern portion of the wave continued westward , crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 22 . As the wave entered a monsoon @-@ like environment , convection increased on September 23 . An associated area of disorganized clouds and thunderstorms persisted off the coast of Mexico for several days , although due to wind shear and its proximity to land , short @-@ term tropical cyclone development — if any — was expected to occur slowly . On September 27 , it began to show signs of organization ; the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) remarked upon the potential for a tropical cyclone to develop within the next day . It is estimated that the system became a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 28 , while located about 140 miles ( 230 km ) to the south of Manzanillo , Mexico . 
 The depression moved slowly toward the southwest and became better organized , despite a decrease in the coverage of deep convection . By late September 28 the depression was approaching tropical storm status ; it turned to the northwest and attained winds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) at 0600 UTC on September 29 , at which time it was assigned the name Otis . That evening , wind shear relented and conditions became more favorable for the storm 's intensification . Convection wrapped almost fully around the center , and early on September 3 , Otis was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . Shortly thereafter , a ragged eye feature developed ; it quickly became better defined as it entered the scope of weather radar in Cabo San Lucas . 
 Otis began gradually entering cooler ocean waters , although the National Hurricane Center noted in one of its discussions on the system that the environment was still warm enough to support a stronger storm . The hurricane continued drifting northwestward , and early on October 1 it reached peak intensity at Category 2 status . At the time , maximum sustained winds were at 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) and barometric pressure was recorded at 970 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 64 inHg ) . Hours later , however , it began to weaken , a trend that continued due to southwesterly wind shear and dry air . The cloud pattern associated with the hurricane deteriorated on October 2 , and the center of circulation was separated from the convective activity . Otis weakened to a tropical storm and drifted erratically toward the north @-@ northwest as a result of weak steering currents . Over increasingly cold waters , the cyclone further weakened to a depression on October 3 and consisted of a small swirl of low @-@ level clouds . It became a remnant low pressure area the next day . The system abruptly turned southeastward and drifted parallel to the coast of the Baja California Peninsula until dissipating on October 5 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 On September 30 , the first tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued with the declaration of tropical storm warnings and hurricane watches along portions of the east and west coasts of the Baja California Peninsula . For several days the advisories were adjusted and amended , and on October 1 , a hurricane warning was posted for the west coast of Baja California , from Agua Blanca to San <unk> . By October 2 , all watches and warnings were discontinued on the east coast of the peninsula , and the remaining advisories were lifted the next day . High winds and heavy rainfall were anticipated . 
 In advance of the storm , the governor of Baja California Sur , Narciso <unk> , ordered emergency personnel to Comondú , <unk> , and Mulege . Approximately 700 families fled to shelters in Cabo San Lucas ; elsewhere , an additional 200 families evacuated in San Jose del Cabo . Some residents in Miraflores and Santiago also left their homes . <unk> asked soldiers to assist the islands of Magdalena and Margarita in preparing for the storm . Five communities in Mexico , including Cabo San Lucas , declared a state of emergency . Authorities throughout the region opened numerous shelters , and in some locations , police officers went door @-@ to @-@ door asking residents to leave . The port in Cabo San Lucas was closed due to the storm 's threat , although the airport remained open . 
 Although the center of Otis remained offshore , tropical storm @-@ force winds were reported at higher elevations over portions of southern Baja California . At Cabo San Lucas , an automated weather station recorded a wind gust to 63 miles per hour ( 101 km / h ) on September 30 , with sustained winds of 49 miles per hour ( 79 km / h ) . There , periods of heavy rainfall mixed with fair skies as the storm passed . No damages or fatalities were reported , although some media reports indicated that the storm caused flooding in parts of the southern Baja California peninsula . Offshore , two ships reported tropical @-@ storm @-@ force winds in association with the storm : the <unk> on October 3 , and the Star Harmonia on October 1 .

It first premiered on the Fox network in the United States on April 28 , 1995 . It was written by series creator Chris Carter and staff writer Howard Gordon , and directed by Rob Bowman . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " F. Emasculata " received a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 9 and was watched by 8 @.@ 5 million households . The episode received mixed reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Scully tries to discover the cause of a mysterious illness after several men in a prison die . Meanwhile , Mulder attempts to find two escapees who could potentially spread the disease . 
 " F. Emasculata " was based on the actual practice of pharmaceutical companies sending scientists all over the world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use . The X @-@ Files director Frank Spotnitz felt that the episode 's exploding pustules were ridiculous because of their over @-@ the @-@ top nature . The Costa Rican forest at the opening was shot at the Seymour Demonstration Forest in Northern Vancouver . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the rain forest of Costa Rica , entomologist Robert Torrance stumbles upon a decomposing boar carcass covered with dark purple pustules . As he extracts an insect from one of the pustules , it erupts , spraying him with fluid . By nightfall , Torrance himself has developed the boils and tries to radio for help . When a group of soldiers arrive the next morning , Torrance is dead . 
 At a prison in Dinwiddie County , Virginia , an inmate — also named Robert Torrance — receives a package containing a boil @-@ covered piece of meat . He becomes infected and dies thirty @-@ six hours later . Two other inmates , Paul and Steve , escape in a laundry cart after being sent to clean Torrance 's cell . Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) are sent to help the U.S. Marshals find them . The agents note that the FBI does not normally investigate prison escapes , and become suspicious as the prison is quarantined by the CDC and the National Guard . Mulder joins the Marshals to hunt the fugitives , while Scully stays behind to investigate the situation in the prison . 
 Scully learns that the lockdown population is infected with an exceedingly deadly contagion , finding a pile of body bags stored for incineration in the prison 's boiler room . Scully cuts open Torrance 's body bag and examines his corpse , but Dr. Osbourne , a member of the CDC team , tries to stop her . A pustule on Torrance 's body erupts in Osbourne 's face , causing him to flee the room . Meanwhile , the fugitives steal an RV and stop at a gas station , where Paul calls his girlfriend , Elizabeth , looking for shelter . The station 's clerk finds an infected Steve in the restroom ; he is knocked unconscious by Paul . Scully calls Mulder after the Marshals raid the gas station , telling him that the contagion could spread into the population if the fugitives are not captured . Mulder sees a CDC biohazard team arrive at the scene , forcibly taking away the clerk in a helicopter . 
 The fugitives arrive at Elizabeth 's house , where she tends to Steve , in the late stages of his infection . One of Steve 's pustules erupts in her face , killing him and infecting Elizabeth . At that moment , Mulder and the Marshals raid the house and arrest her , but find Paul missing . Meanwhile , Scully traces Torrance 's package to Pinck Pharmaceuticals , a major drug developer . She also finds an insect in the body of another prisoner . Dr. Osbourne , who has become infected , reveals that his team works for Pinck and are researching a dilating enzyme produced by the insect . However , the insect has a parasitic life cycle that kills its hosts . Osbourne claims that the insect and its contagion were deliberately introduced into the prison by Pinck as an experiment . He tells Scully that since she was next to him when he became infected , she may have contracted the contagion as well . 
 Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man , believing that he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion . Mulder is adamant that the public should know the truth about Pinck 's actions . The Smoking Man counters that public knowledge of the truth would create mass panic and do more harm than good . Mulder tries to take his case to Scully , but she agrees that exposing Pinck may result in a deadly hysteria . Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company 's crimes , but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance 's package . The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will find himself in .

 The exploding pustules were carefully rigged to burst on command . Makeup supervisor Toby Lindala constructed a handheld device that connected via tube to the faux sores .

Filming the scenes was particularly arduous ; he later noted " I was jammed underneath one of the bus seats with these extras basically stepping on my head .

 = Ryszard Siwiec = 
 Ryszard Siwiec ( Polish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ͡ s ] ; 7 March 1909 — 12 September 1968 ) was a Polish accountant and former Home Army resistance member who was the first person to commit suicide by self @-@ immolation in protest against the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia . Although his act was captured by a motion picture camera , Polish press omitted any mention of the incident , which was successfully suppressed by the authorities . Siwiec prepared his plan alone , and few people realized what he tried to achieve with his sacrifice . His story remained mostly forgotten until the fall of communism , when it was first recounted in a documentary film by Polish director Maciej Drygas . Since then , Siwiec has been posthumously awarded a number of Czech , Slovak , and Polish honors and decorations . 
 Siwiec 's death foreshadowed the much better known self @-@ immolation of Jan Palach in Prague four months later . Siwiec was the first person from Central and Eastern Europe to self @-@ immolate in protest of the invasion , and the only one in Polish history . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Siwiec was born in <unk> on 7 March 1909 , under the Austrian Partition of Poland , then part of Austria @-@ Hungary . He graduated from the Lviv University with a degree in philosophy . Siwiec worked as an accountant since the 1930s in Przemyśl , where he moved shortly after graduation . During World War II he escaped forced labour for the Germans by taking employment as a gardener and joined the Armia Krajowa ( Home Army ) , the Polish resistance movement . Ryszard Siwiec married in 1945 and had five children . 
 = = Self @-@ immolation = = 
 According to friends and family , he had extensive historical knowledge and was deeply disillusioned with the reality of communist Poland . He supported the protesting students during the March 1968 Polish political crisis in Poland , printing bibuła leaflets and asking his daughter to distribute them . According to health professionals , he was of sound mind , and fully rational , at the time of his suicide . Siwiec planned his self @-@ immolation months in advance , writing out a last will in April , and leaving written and tape @-@ recorded statements explaining his revulsion at both the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the People 's Republic of Poland 's participation in it . 
 Siwiec obtained passes to a national harvest festival taking place on 8 September 1968 at the 10th @-@ Anniversary Stadium in Warsaw . His goal was to have his act be witnessed by nearly 100 @,@ 000 spectators , including numerous journalists and the national leadership of the Polish United Workers ' Party . He set himself ablaze during one of the festival dances using a flammable solvent . This method of protest was likely inspired by recent series of similar protests by Buddhist monks in Vietnam , most notably that of Thích Quảng Đức . He had a banner with the words " For our freedom and yours " and " Honour , Fatherland " as well as some leaflets , which he is said to have thrown around right before the incident , though neither attracted much attention , and both items are primarily mentioned only in the documents of the investigating secret police . He refused immediate help and shouted " I protest " . He retained consciousness after the flames had been extinguished , giving brief statements , as well as later when he was transferred to a hospital ( <unk> <unk> ) , where he was able to communicate with the medical personnel , and where he received a brief visit from his wife . In the hospital , he was put under police surveillance , dying four days later on 12 September . 
 = = Significance and remembrance = = 
 The incident was immediately suppressed by the authorities . A story invented on the spot was that it was an accident caused by drinking vodka and smoking , or spontaneously combusting , aiming to divert interest to gossip and portray Siwiec as an irresponsible drunk . He was also declared mentally ill . 
 Despite many attendees at the festival , there were relatively few witnesses , and the incident did not cause any delay in the main proceedings . Journalists and others knew that they would not be able to publish any photographs or movies , so those aware of the incident did not bother recording it other than by accident , nor did any try to investigate it afterward . Most of the few photographs of the incidents have been destroyed or forgotten and lost . Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency ( <unk> Agencja <unk> ) , which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press in the era of communist Poland . His act was captured in a 7 @-@ second film by a motion picture camera of the Polish Film Chronicle , but the official newsreels of the festival omitted any mention of the incident . This footage however survived , mislabeled either by accident or purpose , until it was rediscovered over twenty years later . 
 Polish secret police ( Służba Bezpieczeństwa ) made a routine investigation that ended quickly due to the " death of the culprit " , followed by routine low @-@ key surveillance of his friends and family , during which it intercepted Siwiec 's last letter to his wife ( delivered decades later ) . Overall , the authorities had little trouble suppressing the events , as none of the relatively few witnesses have shown any particular desire to make the event more widely known . There was some gossip about the incident , with most people considering it a suicide rather than an accident , but the reason for it was unclear , and no one connected Siwiec 's dramatic actions to contemporary political events . As publicist Stefan <unk> wrote in his diary two days after Siwiec 's death , " There are rumours about a self @-@ immolation [ during the festival ] but none knows the reason for it . " 
 = = = Funeral = = = 
 Siwiec ' funeral in Przemyśl was well attended , but did not turn into a political manifestation ; it was guarded by police , and secret agents spread rumors aimed at damaging Siwiec 's reputation . His family reported that while some acquaintances were supportive and aware of Siwiec 's true purpose , many turned away from them , either intimidated by the authorities or believing the stories that Siwiec had been drunk or mentally ill . 
 Siwiec 's timing has been described as unfortunate , as he chose to commit his act during a dance ( mazurka ) , at which time his cry was muffled due to the sounds of an orchestra playing . Some , like Tomas Kavaliauskas or Krzysztof <unk> , have speculated that if he had chosen to act moments earlier , during a speech by Polish communist leader Władysław Gomułka , first secretary of the Polish United Workers Party , the commotion he caused would have likely interrupted it and his message might have been witnessed more widely . Publicist Antoni <unk> noted that many other self @-@ immolators like Czech Jan Palach had cooperated with anti @-@ communist opposition movements and left messages and other documents which helped publicize their activities ; Siwiec worked alone and so the Polish anti @-@ communist opposition with which he identified with was not aware of his action and the meaning behind it until much later . 
 Radio Free Europe learned about the incident a few days or months ( sources vary ) after the incident but did not consider the message reliable nor newsworthy , as the broadcaster was also unaware of its political context . This changed only after the famous self @-@ immolation of Palach in Prague four months later , on 19 January 1969 , and after RFE received more information , which clarified the political statement that Siwiec wanted to make . The RFE broadcast about Siwiec aired in February , March or April ( sources vary ) that year . If Palach became aware of Siwiec 's actions , it would thus have been due to word of mouth , rather than from RFE . 
 = = = Recognition = = = 
 Through the efforts of his family and friends , information about Siwiec became known to the anti @-@ communist Solidarność opposition in Poland by the 1980s . A brochure about him was published in 1981 . After the fall of communism , Siwiec became the subject of the 1991 documentary film Hear My Cry ( <unk> mój <unk> ) , by Polish director Maciej Drygas . The film won several awards including the European Film Awards " Felix " prize for " Best Documentary " that year . Drygas , who is credited with reconstructing and popularizing Siwiec 's story , remarked that compared to other similar incidents of that time , such as the self @-@ immolations of Palach or Romas <unk> , Siwiec death 's is unique in how little attention it attracted . Jan Nowak @-@ <unk> , the director of the Polish section of Radio Free Europe , expressed a similar sentiment : " This was an unheard of human tragedy ... The tragedy lay in that his sacrifice went completely unnoticed . " In the same vein , Kavaliauskas interprets Drygas ' movie as a critique of contemporary Polish society , saying that witnesses did not want to have this incident spoil their enjoyment of the festival on an otherwise " perfect day " . 
 Following Drygas ' movie , Ryszard Siwiec was posthumously awarded a number of Czech , Slovak and Polish state decorations . Memorial plaques dedicated to his memory exist in Warsaw , <unk> and Przemyśl . A bridge in Przemyśl , where he lived , was named after him in 1991 , as well as a street in Prague in front of the Czech Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes , with a nearby memorial dedicated to him , unveiled in 2010 . A street in Warsaw was named for him in 2011 . Nonetheless , as noted by Kavaliauskas in 2010 , he still is less known than other self @-@ immolators of his time .

 Bradwall is a small village and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire East , about 2 mi ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) northwest of Sandbach in the ceremonial county of Cheshire , England , and about 20 mi ( 32 km ) south of Manchester . According to the 2011 census , the population of the entire parish was 182 . The area is predominantly agricultural , with no manufacturing or retail outlets . 
 The village is not mentioned in the 11th @-@ century Domesday survey , but from the 13th century gained notability as the manorial estate of Richard de Bradwall and his successors , including the families of Venables , <unk> and Oldfield . From the early 19th century , it became the seat of the Latham family of Bradwall who resided at Bradwall Hall until its demolition in the early 20th century . 
 Bradwall hosts social events at the Village Hall , horse trial competitions ( eventing ) at Manor farm , and coarse fishing at Field Farm Fisheries . The Wesleyan Chapel Methodist Church has been the only place of worship since 1882 and closed in September 2013 . The manufacturer of Foden Trucks and their award @-@ winning <unk> Motor Works Band , were based in Bradwall until a boundary change in 1936 placed them in the adjacent parish of Sandbach .

 Bradwall is not mentioned in the Domesday Book , completed in 1086 for William I of England , at which time the area was thought to be uncultivated moorland between Brereton and <unk> , that formed part of the southern boundary of the Barony of Kinderton , the historic name of Middlewich . 
 The township derives its name from the Old English word <unk> , meaning broad , and <unk> meaning spring . Variant spellings include ( dates in brackets ) : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Bradwall ( 1226 ) , Brad ( e ) well ( e ) ( 1281 ) , Brod ( e ) wall ( 1324 ) , <unk> ( 1326 ) , <unk> ( 1415 ) , Bardwell ( 1438 ) , and , Bradwell ( 1724 ) . The name was also associated with the local hamlet of <unk> , where it was referred to as Bradwall et Hollins ( c . 1662 ) , and Bradwall cum Hollins ( 1819 ) . Today , the township also lends its name to the hamlet of Bradwall Green .

 There is evidence of Bronze Age and Roman activity in the area . A Late Bronze Age axe head dating to around 1000 @-@ 801 BC was found near Fields Farm Fisheries in Bradwall . Around a thousand Roman coins dating from not earlier than 270 AD were discovered in 1820 , on the eastern side of Bradwall , a short distance from the Brindley Moor 's Farm and about four miles direct from the Roman station at Kinderton , at a point where a small brook is crossed by the footpath from Brereton to Sandbach . Discovered by a mole @-@ catcher , the coins included examples of denarii of Gallienus , Claudius II , Tetricus , <unk> , and Diocletian . The remains of part of a Roman road , are also thought to have been discovered near the western side of Bradwall , by <unk> , towards the west of Sandbach , and near King Street . Since the 1936 parish boundary changes , the road 's location is now in Elworth on Roman Way in Sandbach Parish .

 The first records that mention Bradwall are from about the 13th century , when the Venables family of Kinderton divided the Manorial estate ( i.e. the land ) of Bradwall into two parts or " moieties " . Several families have been associated with either the Manor , or the more recent country seat at Bradwall Hall , including :

 The country seat of Bradwall ( i.e. its buildings and its estate ) is thought to have been originally on the west side of the parish , within a rectangular moat with a large pool , with the name <unk> , near Hollins Wood .

 Located nearer the middle of the parish , Bradwall Hall was the seat of the Latham Family .

Following the 19th @-@ century decline of the English country house , Bradwall Hall was demolished on 16 October 1960 , blown up by the 214 Field Squadron of the Royal Engineers , although one of its cottages and the coach @-@ house remain , and they are now Grade II listed buildings , dated by English Heritage to the 17th century .

 Bradwall Reformatory School was built by George William Latham ( 1827 – 1886 ) on his own property at Bradwall Hall , in 1855 , and aimed to reform delinquent boys through the use of an industrial labour apprenticeship . A report to the House of Commons in 1861 reported that : 
 " There were 58 boys in the school when I inspected it . [ ... ] I was glad to find that more of the ordinary farming processes were being resorted to ; the plough and other common agricultural machines employed , so that the training of the lads as farm servants would be gradually made more complete than the use of spade labour allows of . The books are well kept . The punishments had been much fewer , chiefly fines or loss of privilege . [ ... ] : The cost per head for the year was <unk> . 9s . 11d . " 
 Notable detainees included two eight @-@ year @-@ old boys , Peter Barratt and James Bradley , who on 11 April 1861 abducted and killed two @-@ year @-@ old George Burgess . They were charged with manslaughter , and sentenced by the judge Sir Charles Crompton to be sent to the Reformatory at Bradwall , which " was to rank as the most enlightened and successful institution of its kind in the country " . Another detainee was one Joshua Tolley who was sent to Bradwall in 1871 at the age of eight . He was in and out of reform school until the age of 16 , but as a persistent offender , served sentences in Knutsford and Dartmoor prisons . 
 George William Latham 's cousin , Charles Latham ( 1816 – 1907 ) was surgeon to the Bradwall Reformatory from its foundation until his retirement in 1903 . The school was renamed Bradwall Training School in 1908 , and closed in 1920 . The buildings are now Grade II listed , converted into cottages .

 = Tropical Storm Vongfong ( 2002 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Vongfong , known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Milenyo , affected both the Philippines and China after a deadly flood season . The 14th named storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season , Vongfong developed as a tropical depression on August 10 . Initially it was disorganized due to hostile conditions , and it failed to intensify significantly before crossing the Philippine island of Luzon . There , flooding forced 3 @,@ 500 people to evacuate their homes . In the Philippines , the storm killed 35 people and caused $ 3 @.@ 3 million in damage . 
 After affecting the Philippines , the tropical depression dissipated in the South China Sea , although it reformed on August 15 . It moved northwestward , strengthening into Tropical Storm Vongfong . It brushed eastern Hainan before making landfall on August 19 in southern China near Wuchuan , Guangdong . Soon after it dissipated , the storm dropped heavy rainfall across the region , causing one traffic accident in Hong Kong and killing twelve people due to landslides . The storm destroyed 6 @,@ 000 houses , mostly in Guangdong , and damage in the country totaled at least $ 86 million . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On August 8 , an area of convection , or thunderstorms , formed to the west @-@ northwest of Palau , with a weak circulation connected to the monsoon trough . The system had good outflow , although it was initially within an area of increasing moderate wind shear , which limited organization . Convection increased , and although the circulation was exposed , the shear later decreased enough for the system to organize into a tropical depression on August 10 ; the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) labeled it as Tropical Depression 18W , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) labeled it as an unnumbered depression , and the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) gave it the name Tropical Depression Milenyo . 
 Upon developing , the depression was located in an area of weak steering currents , still connected to the monsoon rough , and it moved slowly to the west @-@ northwest . The thunderstorms continued to be sheared to the west of the circulation , which limited strengthening . On August 12 , the JTWC briefly upgraded the system to a tropical storm after a temporary increase in thunderstorms , although the system soon weakened . A ridge to the north caused a general westward track toward the Philippines . With a fully exposed circulation , the depression made landfall at 0800 UTC on August 13 near Infanta on the Philippine island of Luzon . It soon dissipated due to continued shear and land interaction . The remnants continued westward into the South China Sea , and PAGASA and JMA both discontinued advisories early on August 14 . However , on August 15 , a tropical depression re @-@ developed halfway between Vietnam and the Philippines , with a circulation exposed from the convection due to moderate wind shear . That day , the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 20W . 
 After redevelopment , wind shear continued to be a problem , with convection located southwest of the center . Early on August 17 , a pulse in the monsoon increased thunderstorms and allowed the system to become better organized . The convection became more concentrated and the circulation less exposed . As a result , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vongfong early on August 18 , still in the central South China Sea . Around that time , the storm began moving more quickly to the northwest due to a developing ridge to its northeast . Although the JMA estimated peak 10 – minute sustained winds of only 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) , the JTWC assessed Vongfong as continuing to intensify to peak 1 – minute winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) , early on August 19 . By that time , the storm was near Hainan , and at 1240 UTC that day , Vongfong made landfall in southern China near Wuchuan , Guangdong . It quickly weakened over land , dissipating early on August 20 to the west of Guilin .

 Heavy rains from the storm affected the Philippines , causing flooding that forced 3 @,@ 500 people to evacuate their houses . This occurred after a month of heavy rainfall from several tropical cyclones in July . Officials closed schools and advised small boats to remain at port . A vessel capsized offshore Antique Province , and its crew of 15 was rescued . At least six people died due to electrocution , after downed power lines touched floodwaters . The storm spawned a tornado and caused landslides in Negros Oriental . The storm killed 35 people in the country and injured 22 others . Damage was estimated at $ 3 @.@ 3 million ( ₱ 172 million 2002 PHP ) . Milenyo was the final storm to be named by PAGASA during 2002 . 
 On August 17 , the Hong Kong Observatory ( HKO ) issued standby signal number 1 due to the storm 's reformation in the South China Sea . Vongfong made landfall west of the territory , although its outer rainbands spread across the region . Slick roads contributed to a traffic accident in Sai Kung in which one person was killed . Rainfall in Hong Kong reached 133 mm ( 5 @.@ 2 in ) in the town of Kwai Chung . The rainbands also produced gusty winds ; sustained winds peaked at 75 km / h ( 47 mph ) , with gusts to 110 km / h ( 68 mph ) at the mountain peak of Tai Mo Shan . While moving ashore , Vongfong produced a storm surge of 0 @.@ 48 m ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) in Shek Pik . The storm downed a few trees across the territory , and a fallen branch injured one man . Another person was injured by a damaged awning . 
 In Hainan , the threat from Vongfong prompted officials to close the primary airport and to restrict sea traffic with Guangdong . As a result , 113 flights were delayed , stranding more than 3 @,@ 000 people . On the island , rainfall reached as high as 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) in Haikou over a three @-@ day period . In the city , the storm downed 2 @,@ 145 trees , and damage was estimated at $ 456 @,@ 000 ( ¥ 3 @.@ 8 million CNY . In the midst of a deadly flooding season across China , including Tropical Storm Kammuri that affected the region only 12 days earlier , Vongfong brought additionally heavy rainfall to southwestern China ; totals in Guangdong peaked at 222 @.@ 6 mm ( 8 @.@ 76 in ) in Zhanjiang , and in Guangxi , rainfall reached 124 mm ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) in a nine @-@ hour period in <unk> County . The storm washed a boat ashore about 60 km ( 37 mi ) southwest of Hong Kong , although the passengers were rescued . Rains spread as far north as Hunan , where previous flooding prompted a state of emergency . In neighboring Jiangxi , floods caused the Yangtze River to crest above warning levels in Jiujiang . River levels also rose in Liuzhou in Guangxi . Wind gusts as strong as 144 km / h ( 90 mph ) were reported in Zhanjiang , and a station in Guangxi reported gusts to 115 km / h ( 71 mph ) . The storm caused flooding and landslides that damaged thousands of houses . Some areas lost electricity during the storm , and the storm disrupted traffic in the region . Vongfong flooded 46 @,@ 000 ha ( 110 @,@ 000 acres ) of crop fields , and storm flooding also damaged hundreds of reservoirs . Vongfong destroyed 5 @,@ 600 houses in Guangdong , many of them in Zhanjiang , and provincial damage there was estimated at $ 46 million ( ¥ 382 million CNY ) . In Guangxi , the storm killed twelve people , eight due to landslides .

 Jet Force Gemini is a third @-@ person shooter video game developed and published by Rare for the Nintendo 64 video game console . It was first released in North America on October 11 , 1999 and in Europe on November 2 , 1999 . The story of the game follows three members of the Jet Force Gemini team as they try to stop the advances of the dark insect tyrant Mizar and his army . The game features a single @-@ player campaign where the player must explore a galaxy and save a large number of Tribals , a group of survivors who have been enslaved and imprisoned by Mizar . The game also includes a multiplayer deathmatch for two to four players and a no split @-@ screen co @-@ operative mode . The gameplay shares elements with platform , action @-@ adventure , and run and gun games . 
 Jet Force Gemini was developed by Rare 's Blast Corps team , who originally considered the possibility to use the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak . The game received generally positive reviews from critics , with an aggregate review score of 80 out of 100 at the review aggregate website Metacritic . Praise was given to its graphics , sound and original gameplay , while criticism was levelled at the game 's difficult controls and insistence on having to save every Tribal to fully complete the game . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Jet Force Gemini revolves around the Jet Force Gemini team attempting to defeat the evil leader Mizar and his horde of Drones . Jet Force Gemini is composed of three main characters : Juno , a taciturn human male whose parents were killed by space pirates that invaded his home station ; Vela , Juno 's feisty twin sister ; and Lupus , Jet Force Gemini 's <unk> mascot . The game begins with the three characters in orbit around the planet <unk> after barely escaping the destruction of the entire Jet Force fleet at the hands of Mizar . Their ship has been damaged , leaving them defenseless and unable to warp out of the system . It is not long before the team witnesses Mizar 's attack on <unk> . Soon afterwards , their cruiser is attacked by a large craft of Mizar 's . <unk> by drones and out of time , the three decide to abandon the ship and go off on their own separate paths to stop the invasion . 
 As the game progresses , the heroes eventually find themselves reunited at Mizar 's Palace and face to face with Mizar himself . However , Mizar , enraged and vowing revenge on the human race , escapes to a nearby asteroid where he sets course to impact with Earth . King Jeff , the beloved leader of the Tribals , quickly arranges a plan to help the heroes : by providing an ancient starship that can quickly catch up to Mizar 's asteroid . Nevertheless , the team needs to locate several vital parts scattered throughout the galaxy , as well as rescue all the Tribals enslaved by Mizar . Also , King Jeff upgrades the heroes with new armor and jet packs that allow them to fly . From this point on , the team stays united and , together , works to search every world for anything they can find . 
 Once all the Tribals are rescued and the parts found , the team , along with King Jeff , reassembles the old Tribal craft and quickly depart to save Earth . After a rough landing , Juno fights through Mizar 's guards and eventually confronts the tyrant . To the surprise of all though , Mizar is revealed to be a robot controlled by King Jeff 's jealous brother , Barry . Realising that destroying Barry 's robot ruined their best chance of destroying the asteroid , the team is out of options . In an honorable notion , Floyd , the quiet little robot that defected from Mizar and followed the team , offers to sacrifice himself to destroy the asteroid . Hesitantly , the team agrees and attaches a timed warhead to Floyd before sending him into the core . With no time to spare , the team returns to the Tribal craft and departs only seconds before Floyd reaches the core . In a brilliant flash of light , the asteroid is destroyed mere miles away from entering the atmosphere of Earth . Afterwards on Earth , Jet Force Gemini is given the highest honors for their many accomplishments . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Jet Force Gemini is a third @-@ person shooter with elements of platform , action @-@ adventure , and run and gun games . Players control the playable character from a third @-@ person perspective in a free three dimensional environment . The game features extensive levels to explore , items to collect , power @-@ ups that enhance characters health and weaponry , towering bosses to defeat , and devastation on a massive scale . Unlike other Rare shooters such as GoldenEye 007 or Perfect Dark , the weapons in Jet Force Gemini feature no magazines and cannot be reloaded after a certain number of shots . Players fight on foot and have the ability to jump . Much of the game is spent in battle , but some parts feature jump mechanics , as the player can hang from most ledges , swim and fly using jet packs when needed . In combat , the player is free to set on a manual aiming system with the targeting camera fixed behind the character ’ s head . When using this technique , a reticle appears on screen and the playable character becomes translucent so that players can aim and shoot with finesse . By contrast , when walking around , the game plays much like a typical 3D platformer . 
 Exploration is one of the most important aspect of the gameplay . The campaign features a galaxy that is composed of 15 nonlinear worlds , with areas connected by different types of doors . Most of the doors open automatically , but some need a special action to be unlocked . For example , some doors require the player to kill all the enemies in the area to be unlocked , while others may require a specific key . The players can take control of any and all three characters as they progress though the game , using their individual and unshared strengths where required ; Juno can walk through magma safely , Vela can swim underwater indefinitely , and Lupus can hover for a short period of time . These abilities allow the characters to uncover new areas which the other characters cannot reach . Therefore , choosing the right character for the right stage is critical in order to complete the game . Initially , the game does not allow the player to tackle the different worlds with a desired character , and forces the player to use the three characters individually until they reach a meeting point . Once they get to the meeting point , all of the worlds can be tackled with any character in any order . The overall objective of the game is to explore all the areas in order to save all the Tribals and collect several spaceship pieces that allow the player to get to the final stage . 
 The game also features a multiplayer mode , where two to four players can battle it out in both traditional deathmatch and survival matches . Like GoldenEye 007 , options such as weapon schemes , time limit , number of kills or number of lives can be altered to match player preference . Additionally , some multiplayer aspects , such as levels and characters , can be unlocked by finding the corresponding secret in the game 's campaign . Players can also unlock some racing mini @-@ games , where players race from an overhead perspective , as well as a firing range mode , which is similar to a rail shooter like Virtua Cop . In this mode , players are limited to moving a crosshair around the screen while the game automatically follows a specific route . Jet Force Gemini also features a no split @-@ screen co @-@ operative mode , where the second player takes control of Floyd , a floating robot that automatically follows the main playable character , and can assist him by shooting . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development of Jet Force Gemini began in 1997 by Rare 's Blast Corps team , with lead programmer Paul Mountain , who had previously worked on Diddy Kong Racing . The developers took inspiration from many popular games and movies of the time . The free @-@ roaming nature of Nintendo 's Super Mario 64 influenced the scale and the openness of some of the backgrounds and settings , and the collecting and upgrading of weapons were inspired by Super Metroid . Additionally , Mountain revealed that " the behaviour of the bad guys was a mixture of arcade space shooter formations and Quake @-@ style ' attack and cover ' mechanics " . According to him , " I suppose ... we were inspired by all the good stuff we 'd played and enjoyed playing " . The game also borrowed from other non @-@ related video games sources . Lead artist Lee Musgrave admitted : " There are elements of Star Wars in there , Aliens , Dune , Battle of the Planets , even Stargate – it was a real mix of everything and anything ' space ' related . " 
 At one time , the game 's protagonists Juno and Vela were designed as younger and more cartoon @-@ like with large heads , but were later changed to their more mature versions at Nintendo 's request . The game 's controls were one of the main concerns during development . The idea was to retain a character @-@ based game , where players could see the character they were playing , while keeping the tightness and accuracy of first @-@ person shooters . Rare initially attempted to automate the change of view and targeting mode based on the context of the action , but this idea was eventually replaced with a manual system . According to Mountain , " The solution we ended with is a beautiful thing ... It feels very old @-@ school to me ; difficult , unforgiving , but ultimately precise " . As several members of the team enjoyed racing games and had also worked on Diddy Kong Racing , the team decided to include the futuristic Ant racing featured in the campaign and the top @-@ down arcade racing games in the multiplayer . 
 Developers initially considered the possibility to use the 4MB Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak , but the idea was eventually dropped . According to Mountain , " we wanted to deliver the same experience to all players and were confident that we could do this using the standard 4MB of RAM on the console . " This led to some confusion as the box cover for the original release stated that it did support such a feature . Nintendo provided a quick @-@ fix to the mislabeled covers by providing stickers declaring its rumble pak compatibility and fixed later printings of the boxes . The game was originally planned for release on August 31 , 1999 , but was pushed back to September 27 in order to give the programmers time to polish up the game . It was then pushed back even further to October 11 due to manufacturing delays . Jet Force Gemini was localized as Star Twins ( <unk> ) in Japan due to Nintendo 's opinion that the Japanese pronunciation of the original name , " <unk> <unk> <unk> " was too difficult to pronounce . 4Kids Entertainment obtained the rights to merchandising both Jet Force Gemini and Perfect Dark toys , movies , and other recreational products , but the company did not produce any merchandise for the franchise . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Jet Force Gemini received generally positive reviews from video game critics . At the review aggregate website Metacritic , the game holds an average review score of 80 out of 100 . GameSpot reviewer Nelson Taruc awarded the game a rating of 8 @.@ 8 out of 10 , commenting : " Nintendo 64 fans should pick up this title without delay and hope that Rareware 's team of top @-@ notch talent will continue to churn out even more games like this one for years to come " . Matt Casamassina of IGN praised Rare for exploring new mechanics and concluded his review by saying that " this is still one of Nintendo 64 's most original games and it has much more good going for it than it does bad " . 
 The audio and sound effects were lauded . IGN pointed out that the music is " some of the very best ever put into a Nintendo 64 game " and described the sound effects as " dead @-@ on and crystal clear " . Steve Graff , writing for Gaming Target , observed that the audio is suspenseful and atmospheric , while Johnny Liu of Game Revolution opined that the game " goes for a more operatic feel than the generic video game techno " . The graphics were praised for their diversity , colour and lighting effects , but some publications remarked that the frame rate can drop significantly when the action increases . The enemy AI , challenge and variety of weapons were also highlighted positively . According to IGN , " It 's old @-@ school gameplay brought into 3D and it 's all extremely satisfying " . 
 While critics generally praised the game 's level design and length , several reacted negatively to the insistence on having to save every Tribal to fully complete the game . According to GameCritics , " Going through each level three times becomes majorly tedious [ ... ] and finding them also lead a lot of pointless legwork " . Ravi <unk> of Gaming Age also criticized the fact of restarting an entire level when a single Tribal is accidentally killed . IGN declared this task to be " far too tedious to truly be enjoyed " . Despite the criticism , Game Revolution admitted that this " is countered by the pure fun of running around tearing through giant bugs with lasers " . 
 The multiplayer mode received a mixed reaction . IGN called it " slow and clunky " , while Gaming Age observed that the third @-@ person view " takes up far too much of the " already tiny split screen [ and ] the complex control system does not help make it a game to pick @-@ up @-@ and @-@ play " . Nevertheless , the minigames and co @-@ operative mode received more praise . Publications also claimed that the controls were complex and confusing . IGN remarked that the targeting system is not very intuitive . In contrast , Gaming Age stated that " once you get the hang of it after about an hour 's play , it does get quite easy to use " . Similarly , GameSpot felt that they remain responsive at all times , but admitted that the alternation between the two distinct control styles " might prove distasteful to some " .

 A Game Boy Color version of Jet Force Gemini was in development in 2000 , but was ultimately cancelled . The owner of the prototype cartridge has attested that the game appears to be nearly complete , though it was never officially announced by either Rare or Nintendo . In an October 2012 interview , former Rare designer and producer Martin Wakeley commented : " Jet Force Gemini on the Gameboy was the only occasion I can remember Rare outsourcing anything . It was being done by Bits Studios and was nearly done last time I saw it , I ’ m not sure what happened to it . " 
 In 2000 , Jet Force Gemini was ranked by IGN at number 20 in their list of The Top 25 N64 Games of All Time . In 2009 , Official Nintendo Magazine ranked it the 93rd best game available on Nintendo platforms . The staff called it Rare 's " big hope " due to the highly anticipated but delayed Nintendo 64 game Perfect Dark . Subsequent games developed by Rare have featured cameo appearances of Jet Force Gemini , including Kameo : Elements of Power , Viva Piñata : Trouble in Paradise , and Banjo @-@ Tooie . Players may also dress their character up as Juno , Vela , and Lupus in Minecraft : Xbox 360 Edition through the use of a downloadable content pack . The game is included as part of the Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One , with support for dual @-@ analog controls being added post @-@ release .

 The Enterprise enters the Epsilon <unk> system , searching for the legendary world of Aldea . The planet de @-@ cloaks , and reveals itself to the ship . The Aldeans beam down Commander William Riker ( Jonathan Frakes ) , Counselor Deanna Troi ( Marina Sirtis ) , and Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher ( Gates McFadden ) to the planet . The Aldeans explain that they have been unable to bear children for many years and revealed themselves to the Enterprise in hopes they could trade their advanced technology for some of the Enterprise 's children so that they can re @-@ populate their world . Riker refuses and the crew is returned to the Enterprise . Simultaneously , seven children , including young Wesley Crusher ( Wil Wheaton ) , are taken down to the planet protected by a planetary energy shield that the crew of the Enterprise are unable to penetrate . While the Aldean elders attempt to integrate the children into their society , Wesley is shown the " Custodian " , an ancient computer system that the Aldeans rely on but do not understand . 
 As Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) attempts to negotiate with the Aldeans , they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her son on the planet . Wesley hints about the Custodian to her , while she secretly passes him a tricorder to scan the Aldeans . After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children 's return , they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp . The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate . During the return trip , Dr. Crusher reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning , which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered . On arrival back at the planet , Picard orders the crew to try to find a way through the planet 's shield while he restarts negotiations . 
 Wesley , aware the Enterprise is in orbit , arranges for the children to passively resist . When the Aldeans request Picard 's help to resolve the issue with the children , the crew finds a way to beam through the shield , allowing Commander Riker and Lt. Commander Data ( Brent Spiner ) to sneak onto the planet . Data manages to disable the Custodian , disrupting the Aldean 's transporter and planetary shield . Dr. Crusher explains to the Aldeans that their shield has weakened the ozone layer of their planet , exposing the inhabitants to ultraviolet radiation that has left them unable to bear children . The radiation would likely have the same effects on the children from the Enterprise . Without the planetary shield , the ozone layer will naturally return , allowing the Aldeans to reproduce again . The Aldeans recognize the error of their ways and return the children to the Enterprise . They accept Starfleet 's help to correct their ancient systems and recognize that they will have to forgo their invisibility to continue their society .

 Writer Hannah Louise Shearer pitched the episode to associate producer D. C. Fontana , highlighting the families living on board the Enterprise . While the pilot episode " Encounter at Farpoint " first mentioned the children on the ship , " When the Bough Breaks " was the first time they had been used as a plot element . Shearer also discussed a story idea with series creator Gene Roddenberry about " a society that had lost its humanity in favor of technology " . Originally , there was a subplot involving the separation of the saucer section with the saucer taken hostage . Shearer described Wheaton 's performance in the episode as " just wonderful " . " When the Bough Breaks " was the first of five episodes credited to Shearer ; she later described it as her favourite episode . It was the only episode of the series directed by Kim Manners . Manners later produced the television series The X @-@ Files and Supernatural . 
 Visual effects supervisor Robert Legato created a two @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) model of the Aldean computer . It was cheaper to build a model of the computer for around US $ 3 @,@ 000 than to create a series of matte paintings . Ron Jones took a simple approach to the score , using a lilting theme with a piano or flute instead of singing . The theme is representative of the Enterprise 's children and first appeared in the opening cue , " Escape From Calculus " . The technology of Aldea is embodied by electronic music across several pieces , including " Scanning for Children " and " Power Source " . 
 Among the guest stars in " When the Bough Breaks " were Jerry Hardin who later appeared again in The Next Generation as Mark Twain in the two @-@ part episode " Time 's Arrow " , and appeared in The X @-@ Files as Deep Throat . Brenda Strong went on to appear as Mary Alice Young in 179 episodes of Desperate Housewives , and was nominated for two Emmy Awards . Several uncredited children appeared , including Mackenzie Westmore , the daughter of make @-@ up supervisor Michael Westmore and the younger siblings of Wil Wheaton , Jeremy and Amy .

DeCandido praised Patrick Stewart 's performance of Captain Picard , noting that his " anger and outrage and justified self @-@ righteousness at the kidnapping of children modulates nicely into diplomacy when negotiating with the Aldeans and amusingly into total discomfort when he has to actually deal directly with the children " . He gave the episode a score of six out of ten . James Hunt , writing for Den of Geek , said that it was " a decent enough story , but not in a way that makes you want to watch it " . He also felt that it was " a complete throwaway episode and contains almost nothing unique to the franchise " . 
 Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club said that he was scared by the way he liked the episode despite it focusing on Wesley . He noticed the similarity between the " legendary " planets of Aldea in the episode and <unk> in The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , a reference Handlen considered possibly deliberate . He thought that the child @-@ heavy episode wasn 't " as bad as it could 've been " , and gave the episode a " B " grade . Michelle Erica Green in her review for TrekNation , described " When the Bough Breaks " as " tedious , plodding and didactic " with a " preposterous " ending . She thought that the plot element of ozone damage was not optimal and that the quality of the episode was typical of the first season . 
 " When the Bough Breaks " was first released on VHS cassette in the United States and Canada on August 26 , 1992 . The episode was released in March 2002 on the Star Trek : The Next Generation season one DVD box set . It was included as part of the season one Blu @-@ ray set on July 24 , 2012 .

 The Lion King is a 1994 American animated epic musical film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures . It is the 32nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series . The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa , and was influenced by William Shakespeare 's Hamlet . The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance . The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff , produced by Don Hahn , and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi , Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton . Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice , and original scores were written by Hans Zimmer . The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick , James Earl Jones , Jeremy Irons , Jonathan Taylor Thomas , Moira Kelly , Nathan Lane , Ernie Sabella , Rowan Atkinson , Robert Guillaume , Madge Sinclair , Whoopi Goldberg , Cheech Marin , and Jim Cummings . 
 The Lion King tells the story of Simba , a young lion who is to succeed his father , Mufasa , as king ; however , after Simba 's uncle Scar murders Mufasa , Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile in shame and despair . Upon maturation living with two <unk> , Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend , Nala , and his shaman , Rafiki , before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny . 
 Development of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg , Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe . Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment , and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director , being later joined by Allers . Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas , which wound up attracting most of Disney 's top animators . Some time after the staff traveled to Hell 's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film 's setting and animals , Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical , and was replaced by Minkoff . When Hahn joined the project , he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten . Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at Disney @-@ MGM Studios in Florida . Computer animation was also used in several scenes , most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence . 
 The Lion King was released on June 15 , 1994 , to a positive reaction from critics , who praised the film for its music , story and animation ; it finished its theatrical run as the highest @-@ grossing release of 1994 and the second highest @-@ grossing film of all time . The Lion King garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy . The film has led to many derived works , such as a Broadway adaptation ; two direct @-@ to @-@ video follow @-@ ups — the sequel The Lion King II : Simba 's Pride ( 1998 ) and the prequel / parallel The Lion King 1 ½ ( 2004 ) — two television series , Timon and Pumbaa and The Lion Guard , and a 3D re @-@ release in 2011 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the Pride Lands of Africa , a lion rules over the animals as king . The birth of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi 's son Simba creates envy and resentment in Mufasa 's younger brother , Scar , who knows his nephew now replaces him as heir to the throne . After Simba has grown into a young cub , Mufasa gives him a tour of the Pride Lands , teaching him the responsibilities of being a king and the Circle of Life . Later that day , Scar tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephant graveyard , despite the protests of Mufasa 's hornbill majordomo Zazu . At the graveyard , three spotted hyenas named Shenzi , Banzai and Ed attack the cubs before Mufasa , alerted by Zazu , rescues them and forgives Simba for his actions . That night , the hyenas , who are allied with Scar , plot with him to kill Mufasa and Simba . 
 The next day Scar lures Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there while he gets Mufasa . On Scar 's orders , the hyenas stampede a large herd of wildebeest into the gorge . Mufasa rescues Simba , but as Mufasa tries to climb up the gorge 's walls , Scar throws him back into the stampede , where he is trampled to death . After Simba finds Mufasa 's body , Scar convinces him he was responsible for his father 's death and advises Simba to flee the kingdom . As Simba leaves , Scar orders Shenzi , Banzai and Ed to kill the cub , but Simba escapes . That night , Scar announces to the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king , allowing a pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands . 
 After running far away , Simba collapses from exhaustion in a desert . Timon and Pumbaa , a meerkat and a warthog , find him and nurse him back to health . Simba subsequently grows up with them in the jungle , living a carefree life with his friends under the motto " <unk> <unk> " ( " no worries " in Swahili ) . When he is a young adult , Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness , who turns out to be Nala . She and Simba reunite and fall in love . Nala urges Simba to return home , telling him the Pride Lands have become a wasteland with not enough food and water . Feeling guilty over his father 's death , Simba refuses and storms off , leaving Nala disappointed and angry . As Simba exits the jungle , he encounters Mufasa 's mandrill friend and advisor , Rafiki . Rafiki tells Simba that Mufasa is " alive " and takes him to a pond . There Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the sky , who tells him he must take his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands . Simba realizes he can no longer run from his past and goes home . Nala , Timon , and Pumbaa join him , and agree to help him fight . 
 At the Pride Lands , Simba sees Scar hit Sarabi and confronts him , but Scar taunts Simba over his " part " in Mufasa 's death . However , when Scar pushes Simba to the edge of Pride Rock , he reveals that he killed Mufasa . Enraged , Simba roars back up and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the pride . Timon , Pumbaa , Rafiki , Zazu , and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar , attempting to escape , is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock . Scar begs Simba for mercy , insisting that he is family and placing the blame on the hyenas . Simba no longer believes Scar , but spares his life on the grounds of forever leaving the Pride Lands . Scar appears to comply , but then attacks his nephew . After a fierce fight , Simba throws his uncle off Pride Rock . Scar survives the fall , but is attacked and eaten alive by the hyenas , who overheard his attempt to betray them . 
 With Scar and the hyenas gone , Simba ascends to the top of Pride Rock and takes over the kingdom as the rain falls again . Sometime later , with Pride Rock restored to its former glory , Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala , Timon , and Pumbaa by his side ; Rafiki presents Simba and Nala 's newborn cub to the inhabitants of the Pride Lands , and the Circle of Life continues .

 The idea for The Lion King was conceived in late 1988 during a conversation between Jeffrey Katzenberg , Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider on a plane to Europe to promote Oliver & Company . During the conversation , the topic of a story set in Africa came up , and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea . The idea was then developed by Walt Disney Feature Animation 's vice president for creative affairs Charlie Fink . Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death , and ideas from personal life experiences , such as some of his trials in his bumpy road in politics , saying about the film , " It is a little bit about myself . " In November of that year Thomas Disch ( author of The Brave Little Toaster ) wrote a treatment entitled King of the Kalahari , and afterwards Linda Woolverton spent a year writing drafts of the script , which was titled King of the Beasts and then King of the Jungle . The original version of the film was very different from the final film . The plot was centered in a battle being between lions and baboons with Scar being the leader of the baboons , Rafiki being a cheetah , and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba 's childhood friends . Simba would also not leave the kingdom , but become a " lazy , slovenly , horrible character " due to manipulations from Scar , so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age . By 1990 , producer Thomas Schumacher , who had just completed The Rescuers Down Under , decided to attach himself to the project " because lions are cool " . Schumacher likened the script for King of the Jungle to " an animated National Geographic special " . 
 Oliver & Company director George Scribner was the initial director of the film , being later joined by Roger Allers , who was the lead story man on Beauty and the Beast in October 1991 . Allers brought with him Brenda Chapman , who would become the head of story . Afterwards , several of the lead crew members , including Allers , Scribner , Hahn , Chapman , and production designer Chris Sanders , took a trip to Hell 's Gate National Park in Kenya , in order to study and gain an appreciation of the environment for the film . After six months of story development work Scribner decided to leave the project , as he clashed with Allers and the producers on their decision to turn the film into a musical , as Scribner 's intention was of making a documentary @-@ like film more focused on natural aspects . Rob Minkoff replaced Scribner , and producer Don Hahn joined the production as Schumacher became only an executive producer due to Disney promoting him to Vice President of Development for Feature Animation . Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme , and after establishing the main theme as " leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world " , asked for a final retool . Allers , Minkoff , Chapman and Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale , who had just finished Beauty and the Beast . The script also had its title changed from King of the Jungle to The Lion King , as the setting was not the jungle but the savannah . 
 The Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story , rather than being based on an already @-@ existing work . The filmmakers have said that the story of The Lion King was inspired by the lives of Joseph and Moses from the Bible and William Shakespeare 's Hamlet . During the summer of 1992 , the team was joined by screenwriter Irene Mecchi , with a second screenwriter , Jonathan Roberts , joining a few months later . Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process , fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comic business for Pumbaa , Timon and the hyenas . Lyricist Tim Rice worked closely with the writing team , flying to California at least once a month , as his songs needed to work in the narrative continuity . Rice 's lyrics – which were reworked up to the production 's end – were even pinned to the storyboards during development . Rewrites were frequent , with animator Andreas Deja saying that completed scenes would be delivered only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated due to dialog changes . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the characters – for instance , James Earl Jones was cast because the directors found his voice " powerful " and similar to a lion 's roar . Jones commented that during the years of production , Mufasa " became more and more of a dopey dad instead of [ a ] grand king " . 
 Nathan Lane originally auditioned for Zazu , and Ernie Sabella , for one of the hyenas . Upon meeting each other at the recording studio , the actors , who at the time both co @-@ starred in Guys and Dolls , were asked to record together as hyenas . The directors laughed at their performance and decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa . For the hyenas , the original intention was to reunite Cheech & Chong , but while Cheech Marin accepted to play Banzai , Tommy Chong was unavailable . Thus his role was changed into a female hyena , Shenzi , who was voiced by Whoopi Goldberg . 
 Matthew Broderick was cast as adult Simba early during production , and during the three years of voice acting only recorded with another actor once , and only discovered Moira Kelly voiced Nala at the premiere . Jeremy Irons had at first refused the role due to not being comfortable going from the dramatic performance as Claus von Bülow in Reversal of Fortune to a comedic role . But once he came in , Irons ' performance even inspired the writers to incorporate more of his acting as von Bülow — even adding one of that character 's lines , " You have no idea " - and animator Andreas Deja to watch both Reversal of Fortune and Damage to pick up Irons ' facial traits and tics . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 The development of The Lion King started concurrently with Pocahontas , which most of the animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead , believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two . The story artists also did not have much faith in the project , with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job " because the story wasn 't very good " , and writer <unk> <unk> saying to co @-@ worker Joe Ranft about the film that " I don 't know who is going to want to watch that one . " Most of the leading animators were either doing their first major work supervising a character , or had much interest in animating an animal . Thirteen of these supervising animators , both in California and Florida , were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film 's main characters . The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba , Ruben A. Aquino on adult Simba , Andreas Deja on Scar , Aaron Blaise on young Nala , Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala , and Tony Fucile on Mufasa . Nearly 20 minutes of the film , including the " I Just Can 't Wait to Be King " sequence , were animated at the Disney @-@ MGM Studios facility . Ultimately , more than 600 artists , animators and technicians contributed to The Lion King over the course of its production . Weeks before the film was to be released , production was affected by the 1994 Northridge earthquake , which shut off the studio and required the animators to finish their work from home . 
 The character animators studied real @-@ life animals for reference , as was done for the 1942 Disney film Bambi . Jim Fowler , renowned wildlife expert , visited the studios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings an authentic feel . The animators also studied various animal movements in natural settings at the Miami <unk> under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill . The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew . Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries – which employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance . The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher – which , following Scribner 's request for realism , tried to depict effects such as lens flare – and the works of painters Charles Marion Russell , Frederic Remington and Maxfield Parrish . Since the characters were not anthropomorphized , all the animators had to learn to draw four @-@ legged animals , and the story and character development was done through usage of longer shots following the characters . 
 The use of computers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways . For the " wildebeest stampede " sequence , several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program , multiplied into hundreds , cel shaded to look like drawn animation , and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real , unpredictable movement of a herd . Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minute stampede sequence . Other usages of computer animation were done through CAPS , which helped simulate camera movements such as tracking shots , and was employed on the coloring , lighting and particle effects . 
 = = Music = = 
 Lyricist Tim Rice , who was working with composer Alan Menken on songs for Aladdin , was invited to write the songs , and accepted on the condition of finding a composing partner . As Menken was unavailable , the producers accepted Rice 's suggestion of Elton John , after Rice 's invitation of ABBA fell through due to Benny Andersson being busy with the musical Kristina från <unk> . John expressed an interest in writing " ultra @-@ pop songs that kids would like ; then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them " , mentioning a possible influence of The Jungle Book , where he felt the " music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults " . 
 John and Rice wrote five original songs for this film ( " Circle of Life " , " I Just Can 't Wait to Be King " , " Be Prepared " , " Hakuna Matata " and " Can You Feel the Love Tonight " ) with the singer 's performance of " Can You Feel the Love Tonight " playing over the end credits . The IMAX and DVD releases added another song , " The Morning Report " , which was based on a song discarded during development that eventually got featured in the live musical version of The Lion King . The film 's score was composed by Hans Zimmer , who was hired based on his work in two films in African settings , The Power of One and A World Apart , and supplemented the score with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by Lebo M. Zimmer 's partners Mark Mancina and Jay Rifkin helped with arrangements and song production . 
 The film 's original motion picture soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on July 13 , 1994 . It was the fourth @-@ best @-@ selling album of the year on the Billboard 200 and the top @-@ selling soundtrack . It is the only soundtrack for an animated film to be certified Diamond ( 10 × platinum ) by the Recording Industry Association of America . Zimmer 's complete instrumental score for the film was never originally given a full release by Disney , until the soundtrack 's commemorative 20th anniversary re @-@ release in 2014 . The Lion King also inspired the 1995 release Rhythm of the Pride Lands , with eight songs by Zimmer , Mancina , and Lebo M. 
 The use of the song " The Lion Sleeps Tonight " in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa has led to disputes between Disney and the family of South African Solomon Linda , who composed the song ( originally titled " <unk> " ) in 1939 . In July 2004 , the family filed suit , seeking $ 1 @.@ 6 million in royalties from Disney . In February 2006 , Linda 's heirs reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music , who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money . 
 = = Release = = 
 For The Lion King 's first film trailer , Disney opted to feature a single scene , the entire opening sequence with the song " Circle of Life " . Buena Vista Pictures Distribution president Dick Cook said the decision was made for such an approach because " we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece that we felt like it was probably one of the best four minutes of film that we 've seen " , and Don Hahn added that " Circle of Life " worked as a trailer as it " came off so strong , and so good , and ended with such a bang " . The trailer was released in November 1993 , accompanying The Three Musketeers in theaters , as only a third of The Lion King had been completed . Audience reaction was enthusiastic , causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview . Prior to the film 's release , Disney did 11 test screenings . 
 Upon release , The Lion King was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign which included tie @-@ ins with Burger King , Mattel , Kodak , Nestlé and Payless ShoeSource , and various merchandise , accounting 186 licensed products . In 1994 , Disney earned approximately $ 1 billion with products based on the film , with $ 214 million for Lion King toys during Christmas 1994 alone .

In 2012 , Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the 3D version of The Lion King succeeded was because , " the notion of a 3D re @-@ release was still fresh and exciting , and The Lion King ( 3D ) felt timely given the movie 's imminent Blu @-@ ray release . Audiences have been hit with three 3D re @-@ releases in the year since , meaning the novelty value has definitely worn off . "

 The Lion King was released to critical acclaim . On Rotten Tomatoes , the film holds a rating of 91 % , based on 113 reviews , with an average rating of 8 @.@ 3 out of 10 . It also ranked 56th on their " Top 100 Animation Movies " . The site 's critical consensus reads , " Emotionally stirring , richly drawn , and beautifully animated , The Lion King stands tall within Disney 's pantheon of classic family films . " On Metacritic , the film has a score of 83 out of 100 , based on 14 critics , indicating " universal acclaim " . CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare " A + " grade . 
 Roger Ebert gave it 3 1 / 2 out of 4 @-@ stars and called the film " a superbly drawn animated feature " and , in his print review wrote , " The saga of Simba , which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to Hamlet , is a learning experience as well as an entertainment . " On the television program Siskel & Ebert , the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to previous Disney films . Ebert and his partner Gene Siskel both gave the film a " Thumbs Up " but Siskel said that it was not as good as earlier films such as Beauty and the Beast and was " a good film , not a great one " . Hal Hinson of The Washington Post called it " an impressive , almost daunting achievement " and felt that the film was " spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney 's feature @-@ length animations " , but was less enthusiastic toward the end of his review saying , " Shakespearean in tone , epic in scope , it seems more appropriate for grown @-@ ups than for kids . If truth be told , even for adults it is downright strange . " 
 Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the film , writing that it " has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie " . Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers praised the film and felt that it was " a hugely entertaining blend of music , fun and eye @-@ popping thrills , though it doesn 't lack for heart " . James Berardinelli from ReelViews praised the film saying , " With each new animated release , Disney seems to be expanding its already @-@ broad horizons a little more . The Lion King is the most mature ( in more than one sense ) of these films , and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children . Happily , for those of us who generally stay far away from ' cartoons ' , they have succeeded . " 
 Some reviewers still had problems with the film 's narrative . The staff of TV Guide wrote that while The Lion King was technically proficient and entertaining , it " offers a less memorable song score than did the previous hits , and a hasty , unsatisfying dramatic resolution . " The New Yorker 's Terrence Rafferty considered that despite the good animation , the story felt like " <unk> [ ing ] our responses at will " , as " Between traumas , the movie serves up <unk> banal musical numbers and silly , rambunctious comedy " .

 Certain elements of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a 1960s Japanese anime television show , Jungle Emperor ( known as Kimba the White Lion in the United States ) , with characters having similar analogues , and various individual scenes being similar in composition to the show . Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was in fact working on an American version of Kimba , since he was familiar with the Japanese original . However The Lion King director , Roger Allers , claimed he was unfamiliar with the show : 
 The whole time I worked on The Lion King the name of that show never came up . At least I never heard it . I had never seen the show and really only became aware of it as Lion King was being completed , and someone showed me images of it . I worked with George Scribner and Linda Woolverton to develop the story in the early days but then left to help out on Aladdin . If one of them were familiar with Kimba they didn ’ t say . Of course , it ’ s possible ... Many story ideas developed and changed along the way , always just to make our story stronger . I could certainly understand Kimba ’ s creators feeling angry if they felt we had stolen ideas from them . If I had been inspired by Kimba I would certainly acknowledge my inspiration . All I can offer is my respect to those artists and say that their creation has its loyal admirers and its assured place in animation history . 
 Co @-@ director Rob Minkoff also claimed he was unfamiliar with it " I know for a fact that [ " Kimba " ] has never been discussed as long as I 've been on the project ... In my experience , if Disney becomes aware of anything like that , they say you will not do it . People are claiming copyright infringement all the time . " He also stated that whenever a story is based in Africa , it is " not unusual to have characters like a baboon , a bird or hyenas . " Yoshihiro Shimizu , of Tezuka Productions , which created Kimba the White Lion , has refuted rumours that the studio was paid hush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the industry to sue because , " we 're a small , weak company . It wouldn 't be worth it anyway ... Disney 's lawyers are among the top twenty in the world ! " 
 Protests were raised against one scene where it appears as if the word " SEX " might have been embedded into the dust flying in the sky when Simba flops down , which conservative activist Donald Wildmon asserted was a subliminal message intended to promote sexual promiscuity . One of the animators , Tom <unk> , has stated that the letters spell " SFX " ( a common abbreviation for " special effects " ) , not with an " E " instead of the " F " , and were intended as an innocent " signature " created by the effects animation team . 
 Hyena biologists protested against the animal 's portrayal : one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character , and another — who had organized the animators ' visit to the University of California 's Field Station for Behavioural Research , where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas — included boycotting The Lion King among the ways it would help preserve hyenas in the wild . The hyenas have also been interpreted to represent an anti @-@ immigrant allegory , where the hyenas would be black and Latino ethnic communities . The film has also been criticised for advancing a fascist narrative in its portrayal of the lion kingdom and the circle of life where " only the strong and the beautiful triumph , and the powerless survive only by serving the strong . "

 The first Lion King @-@ related animated projects involved the characters of Timon and Pumbaa . First the duo starred in the animated short " Stand by Me " , featuring Timon singing the eponymous song , which was released in 1995 accompanying the theatrical release of Tom and Huck . Then the duo received their own animated show , The Lion King 's Timon and Pumbaa , which ran for three seasons and 85 episodes between 1995 and 1999 . Ernie Sabella continued to voice Pumbaa , while Timon was voiced by Quinton Flynn and Kevin <unk> in addition to Nathan Lane . 
 Disney released two direct @-@ to @-@ video films related to The Lion King . The first was sequel The Lion King II : Simba 's Pride , issued in 1998 on VHS . The film centers around Simba and Nala 's daughter , Kiara , who falls in love with Kovu , a male lion who was raised in a pride of Scar 's followers , the Outsiders . 2004 saw the release of another Lion King film on DVD , The Lion King 1 ½ . It is a prequel in showing how Timon and Pumbaa met each other , and also a parallel in that it also depicts what the characters were retconned to have done during the events of the original movie . 
 In June 2014 , it was announced that a new TV series based on the film would be released called The Lion Guard , featuring Kion , the second @-@ born cub of Simba and Nala . It was first broadcast on Disney Channel as a television film titled The Lion Guard : Return of the Roar in November 2015 before airing as a series on Disney Junior in January 2016 .

 Along with the film release , three different video games based on The Lion King were released by Virgin Interactive in December 1994 . The main title was developed by Westwood Studios , and published for PC and Amiga computers and the consoles SNES and Sega Mega Drive / Genesis . Dark Technologies created the Game Boy version , while <unk> Developments handled the Master System and Game Gear version . The film and sequel Simba 's Pride later inspired another game , Torus Games ' The Lion King : Simba 's Mighty Adventure ( 2000 ) for the Game Boy Color and PlayStation . Timon and Pumbaa also appeared in Timon & Pumbaa 's Jungle Games , a 1995 PC game collection of puzzle games by 7th Level , later ported to the SNES by <unk> . 
 The Square Enix series Kingdom Hearts features Simba as a recurring summon , as well as a playable in the Lion King world , known as Pride Lands , in Kingdom Hearts II .

 Walt Disney Theatrical produced a musical stage adaptation of the same name , which premiered in Minneapolis , Minnesota in July 1997 , and later opened on Broadway in October 1997 at the New Amsterdam Theatre . The Lion King musical was directed by Julie Taymor and featured songs from both the movie and Rhythm of the Pride Lands , along with three new compositions by Elton John and Tim Rice . Mark Mancina did the musical arrangements and new orchestral tracks . The musical became one of the most successful in Broadway history , winning six Tony Awards including Best Musical , and despite moving to the Minskoff Theatre in 2006 , is still running to this day in New York , becoming the third longest @-@ running show and highest grossing Broadway production in history .

 = Jingle All the Way = 
 Jingle All the Way is a 1996 American Christmas family comedy film directed by Brian Levant and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sinbad , with Phil Hartman , Rita Wilson , Jake Lloyd , James Belushi and Robert Conrad . The plot focuses on two rival fathers , workaholic Howard Langston ( Schwarzenegger ) and stressed out postal worker Myron Larabee ( Sinbad ) , both desperately trying to get a Turbo @-@ Man action figure for their respective sons on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve . 
 Inspired by real @-@ life Christmas toy sell @-@ outs for products such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , the film was written by Randy Kornfield . Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script , adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas , and the project was picked up by 20th Century Fox . Delays on Fox 's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film , while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron . Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations , including the Mall of America . After five weeks filming , production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot . The film 's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo @-@ Man action figure used in the film . 
 Although some critics felt the film was good family entertainment , it was met with a broadly negative response . Much criticism was attached to the film 's script , its focus on the commercialism of Christmas , Levant 's direction and Schwarzenegger 's performance . Nevertheless , it proved a success at the box office , generating $ 129 million worldwide . In 2001 , Fox was ordered to pay $ 19 million to Murray Hill Publishing for stealing the idea for the film ; the verdict was overturned three years later . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Howard Langston ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) is a workaholic mattress salesman , who can 't find time for his wife , Liz ( Rita Wilson ) , and his 9 @-@ year @-@ old son , Jamie ( Jake Lloyd ) — especially when compared to next door " <unk> " divorcee , Ted Maltin ( Phil Hartman ) , who continually puts Howard in a bad light . After missing Jamie 's karate class graduation , Howard resolves to redeem himself by fulfilling Jamie 's ultimate Christmas wish : getting an action figure of Turbo @-@ Man , a popular children 's TV superhero toy that every kid wants . Along the way , Howard meets Myron Larabee ( Sinbad ) , a postal worker dad with a rival ambition , and the two soon become bitter competitors in their race for the action figure . During his search , Howard repeatedly runs into Officer Alexander Hummell ( Robert Conrad ) , a police officer who had earlier pulled him over for a traffic violation . After several failed attempts to find the toy in a store , Howard attempts to buy a Turbo @-@ Man from a Mall of America Santa ( James Belushi ) who is actually the leader of a band of counterfeit toy makers . When he accuses the Santa of undermining the values of Christmas , Howard ends up in a brawl with the gang . He narrowly escapes when the police raid their warehouse and gets out by posing as an undercover detective using a toy badge . 
 Later , Howard and Myron cross paths again , and while they are drinking coffee at Mickey 's Diner , Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas . They hear on the <unk> radio station that the D.J. ( Martin Mull ) is running a Turbo @-@ Man competition . When they get to the studio they find out they can only win a gift certificate . They are nearly arrested but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package ( which he claims is a mail bomb , unaware that it really is one ) . Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face . After his car is stripped by thieves , Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty @-@ handed . Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree , Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo @-@ Man doll from Ted 's house that he had bought for his son Johnny ( E.J. De La Pena ) , but changes his mind at the last moment . He is attacked by Ted 's pet reindeer and the commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz . Liz and Jamie leave for the local <unk> Parade with Ted ; Howard follows , aiming to make amends . At the parade , Ted makes a pass at Liz , but after seeing what he really is , she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog . 
 Howard runs into a bandaged Officer Hummell and accidentally drenches him with hot coffee . In the ensuing chase , Howard runs into a preparations room for the parade and is mistaken for a replacement for the actor who will play Turbo @-@ Man on a parade float . As the " real " Turbo @-@ Man , he presents the coveted limited @-@ edition Turbo @-@ Man doll to his awed son . Before he recognizes his father , Jamie is chased by Myron , who has dressed as Turbo @-@ Man 's arch enemy Dementor ( having caught and tied up the real actor — Richard Moll ) . As the crowd assume this is all part of the show , Howard attempts to rescue his son by utilizing the Turbo @-@ Man suit 's equipment . 
 Howard catches Jamie as he falls from a roof and reveals himself to his son . Officer Hummell gives the doll to Jamie , then is shocked to discover that Howard was Turbo @-@ Man , then Howard apologies to Officer Hummell about everything . Myron is arrested while ranting about having to explain his failure to get the Turbo @-@ Man toy for his son . Touched by Myron 's words , Jamie gives the doll to him and tells Howard that he does not need it since his father is " the real Turbo @-@ Man " . Howard is then crowd surfed away as Liz , Jamie and Myron look on happily . 
 In a post @-@ credits scene , Howard puts the star on the top of his tree and shares a great Christmas spirit with Jamie and Liz until he realizes he also forgot to get a present for Liz . Howard stares in shock at the camera before the fadeout .

 The film draws inspiration from the high demand for Christmas toys such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in the late 1980s and early 1990s , which often led to intense searching and occasional violence amongst shoppers . Randy Kornfield wrote the film 's original screenplay after witnessing his in @-@ laws go to a Santa Monica toy store at dawn in order to get his son a Power Ranger . While admitting to missing the clamor for the Cabbage Patch Kids and Power Rangers , producer Chris Columbus experienced a similar situation in 1995 when he attempted to obtain a Buzz Lightyear action figure from the film Toy Story , released that year . As a result , he rewrote Kornfield 's script , which was accepted by 20th Century Fox . Columbus was always " attracted to the dark side of the happiest holiday of the year " , so wrote elements of the film as a satire of the commercialization of Christmas . Brian Levant was hired to direct the film . Columbus said Levant " <unk> [ ood ] the humor in the material " and " was very animated and excited , and he had a vision of what he wanted to do " . Levant said " The story that was important to me was between the father and son ... it 's a story about love , and a father 's journey to deliver it in the form of a Turbo Man doll . The fact that I got to design a toy line and do the commercials and make pajamas and comic books was fun for me as a filmmaker . But at its root , the movie 's about something really sweet . It 's about love and building a better family . I think that 's consistent with everything I 've done . " 
 Arnold Schwarzenegger was quickly cast . He became available in February 1996 after Fox 's remake of Planet of the Apes was held up again ; Columbus also exited that project to work on Jingle All the Way . The film marks Schwarzenegger 's fourth appearance as the lead in a comedy film , following Twins ( 1988 ) , Kindergarten Cop ( 1990 ) and Junior ( 1994 ) . Schwarzenegger was paid a reported $ 20 million for the role . He enjoyed the film , having experienced last @-@ minute Christmas shopping himself , and was attracted to playing an " ordinary " character in a family film . Columbus initially wanted Joe Pesci to play Myron . Comedian Sinbad was chosen instead , partly due to his similar height and size to Schwarzenegger . Sinbad was suggested for the part by Schwarzenegger 's agent , but the producers felt he was unsuited to the role of a villain as it could harm his clean , family @-@ oriented comedy act and reputation , although Sinbad felt the character would generate the audience 's sympathy rather than hate . Furthermore , he missed the audition due to his appearance with First Lady Hillary Clinton and musician Sheryl Crow on the USO tour of Bosnia and Herzegovina , but Columbus waited for him to return to allow him to audition and , although Sinbad felt he had " messed " it up , he was given the part . He improvised the majority of his lines in the film ; Schwarzenegger also improvised many of his responses in his conversations with Sinbad 's character . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming took place in Minnesota for five weeks from April 15 , 1996 ; at the time , it was the largest film production to ever take place in the state . Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota at locations such as Bloomington 's Mall of America , Mickey 's Diner , downtown Minneapolis , Linden Hills , residential areas of Edina and primarily downtown Saint Paul . Unused shops in the Seventh Place Mall area were redecorated to resemble Christmas decorated stores , while the Energy Park Studios were used for much of the filming and the Christmas lights stayed up at Rice Park for use in the film . The Mall of America and the state 's " semi @-@ wintry weather " proved attractive for the studio . Although Schwarzenegger stated that the locals were " well @-@ behaved " and " cooperative " , Levant often found filming " impossible " due to the scale and noise of the crowds who came to watch production , especially in the Mall of America , but overall found the locals to be " respectful " and " lovely people . " Levant spent several months in the area before filming in order to prepare . The film uses artistic license by treating Minneapolis and Saint Paul as one city , as this was logistically easier ; the police are labeled " Twin Cities Police " in the film . Additionally , the city 's <unk> Parade is renamed the <unk> Parade and takes place on 2nd Avenue during the day , rather than Nicollet Mall at night . Levant wanted to film the parade at night but was overruled for practical reasons . 
 The parade was filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood in California on the New York Street set , due to safety concerns . The set was designed to resemble 2nd Avenue ; the parade was shot from above by helicopters and stitched into matte shots of the real @-@ life street . It took three weeks to film , with 1 @,@ 500 extras being used in the scene , along with three custom designed floats . Other parts of the film to be shot in Los Angeles , California included store interiors , and the warehouse fight scene between Howard and the criminal Santas , for which a Pasadena furniture warehouse was used . Turbo @-@ Man was created and designed for the film . This meant the commercials and scenes from the Turbo @-@ Man TV series were all shot by Levant , while all of the Turbo @-@ Man merchandise , packaging and props shown in the film were custom made one @-@ offs and designed to look " authentic , as if they all sprang from the same well . " Along with Columbus and Levant , production designer Leslie McDonald and character designer Tim Flattery crafted Turbo @-@ Man , Booster and Dementor and helped make the full @-@ size Turbo @-@ Man suit for the film 's climax . Principal production finished in August ; Columbus " fine @-@ tun [ ed ] the picture until the last possible minute , " using multiple test audiences " to see where the big laughs actually lie . "

 As Schwarzenegger only signed on for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly , only six and a half months were available for merchandising , instead of the ideal year . As such , merchandising was limited to a 13 @.@ 5 inch replica $ 25 Talking Turbo @-@ Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo @-@ Man Time Racer vehicle , while no tie @-@ in promotions could be secured . Despite this , several critics wrote that the film was only being made in order to sell the toy . Columbus dismissed this notion , stating that with only roughly 200 @,@ 000 Turbo @-@ Man toys being made , the merchandising was far less than the year 's other releases , such as Space Jam and 101 Dalmatians . 
 The world premiere was held on November 16 , 1996 at the Mall of America in Bloomington where parts of the film were shot . A day of events was held to celebrate the film 's release and Schwarzenegger donated memorabilia from the film to the Mall 's Planet Hollywood . Opening in 2 @,@ 401 theaters on November 22 , Jingle All the Way made $ 12 @.@ 1 million in its first weekend , opening at # 4 behind Star Trek : First Contact , Space Jam and Ransom ; it went on to gross $ 129 million worldwide , recouping its $ 75 million budget . The film was released on VHS in October 1997 , and in November 1998 it was released on DVD . It was rereleased on DVD in December 2004 , followed by an extended director 's cut in October 2007 , known as the " Family Fun Edition " . It contained several minutes of extra footage , as well as other DVD extras such as a behind the scenes featurette . In December of the following year , the Family Fun Edition was released on Blu @-@ ray Disc .

 The film received generally negative reviews from critics , garnering a 17 % " Rotten " rating at Rotten Tomatoes , with 35 negative reviews out of 42 counted . Emanuel Levy felt the film " highly formulaic " and criticized Levant 's direction as little more advanced than a television sitcom . Although he felt Hartman , Wilson and Conrad were not given much opportunity to shine due to the script , he opined that " Schwarzenegger has developed a light comic delivery , punctuated occasionally by an ironic one @-@ liner , " while " Sinbad has good moments " . Neil Jeffries of Empire disagreed , feeling Schwarzenegger to be " wooden " and Sinbad to be " trying desperately to be funnier than his hat " but praised Lloyd as the " saving grace " of the film . 
 The New York Times critic Janet Maslin felt the film lacked any real plot , failed in its attempt at satire , should have included Myron 's only mentioned son and " mostly wasted " Hartman , while Levant 's direction was " listless " . Similarly , the BBC 's Neil Smith criticized the film 's script , its focus on the commercialization of Christmas , as well as Schwarzenegger 's performance which shows " the comic timing of a dead moose , " but singled out Hartman for praise . Chicago Tribune critic Michael Wilmington panned the film , wondering why the characters ( primarily Howard ) acted so <unk> : " Howard Langston is supposed to be a successful mattress manufacturer , but the movie paints him as a hot @-@ tempered buffoon without a sensible idea in his head . " Jack Garner of USA Today condemned the film , finding it more " cynical " than satirical , stating " this painfully bad movie has been inspired strictly by the potential jingle of cash registers . " He wrote of Levant 's directorial failure as he " offers no ... sense of comic timing , " while " pauses in the midst of much of the dialogue are downright painful . " Trevor Johnston suggested that the film " seems to mark a point of decline in the Schwarzenegger career arc " and the anti @-@ consumerism message largely failed , with " Jim Belushi 's corrupt mall Santa with his stolen @-@ goods warehouse ... provid [ ing ] the film 's sole flash of dark humour . " 
 IGN 's Mike Drucker praised its subject matter as " one of the few holiday movies to directly deal with the commercialization of Christmas " although felt the last twenty minutes of the film let it down , as the first hour or so had " some family entertainment " value if taken with a " grain of salt " . He concluded the film was " a member of the so @-@ corny @-@ its @-@ good genre , " while " Arnold delivers plenty of one @-@ liners ripe for sound board crank callers . " Jamie <unk> of The New York Times praised the film 's satirical premise but felt it was " full of unrealized potential " because " the filmmakers [ wrongly ] equate mayhem with humor . " Roger Ebert gave the film two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars , writing that he " liked a lot of the movie " , which he thought had " energy " and humor which would have mass audience appeal . He was , though , disappointed by " its relentlessly materialistic view of Christmas , and by the choice to go with action and ( mild ) violence over dialogue and plot . " Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures concluded that while the film is not very good , as a form of family entertainment it is " surprisingly fun . " 
 Brian Levant was nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Director , but lost to Andrew Bergman for Striptease ; Sinbad , however , won the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actor in a Family film .

 In 1998 , Murray Hill Publishing sued 20th Century Fox for $ 150 @,@ 000 , claiming that the idea for the film was stolen from a screenplay they had purchased from high school teacher Brian Webster entitled Could This Be Christmas ? . They said the script had 36 similarities with Jingle All the Way , including the plot , dialogue and character names . Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993 , and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed the idea was copied by Kornfield , who was Fox 's script reader . In 2001 , Fox were found guilty of stealing the idea and ordered to pay $ 19 million ( $ 15 million in damages and $ 4 million in legal costs ) to Murray Hill , with Webster to receive a portion . Laurel died a few months after the verdict , before receiving any of the money . On appeal , the damages figure was lowered to $ 1 @.@ 5 million , before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 , with a judge deciding the idea was not stolen as Fox had bought Kornfield 's screenplay before he or anybody else at Fox had read Could This Be Christmas ? .

 = Euclidean algorithm = 
 In mathematics , the Euclidean algorithm , or Euclid 's algorithm , is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor ( GCD ) of two numbers , the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder . It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid , who first described it in Euclid 's Elements ( c . 300 BC ) . It is an example of an algorithm , a step @-@ by @-@ step procedure for performing a calculation according to well @-@ defined rules , and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use . It can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form , and is a part of many other number @-@ theoretic and cryptographic calculations . 
 The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number . For example , 21 is the GCD of 252 and 105 ( 252 
 = 21 × 12 and 105 = 
 21 × 5 ) , and the same number 21 is also the GCD of 105 and 147 
 = 252 − 105 . Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers , repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal . When that occurs , they are the GCD of the original two numbers . By reversing the steps , the GCD can be expressed as a sum of the two original numbers each multiplied by a positive or negative integer , e.g. , 21 = 
 5 × 105 + ( − 2 ) × 252 . The fact that the GCD can always be expressed in this way is known as Bézout 's identity . 
 The version of the Euclidean algorithm described above ( and by Euclid ) can take many subtraction steps to find the GCD when one of the given numbers is much bigger than the other . A more efficient version of the algorithm shortcuts these steps , instead replacing the larger of the two numbers by its remainder when divided by the smaller of the two ( with this version , the algorithm stops when reaching a zero remainder ) . With this improvement , the algorithm never requires more steps than five times the number of digits ( base 10 ) of the smaller integer . This was proven by Gabriel Lamé in 1844 , and marks the beginning of computational complexity theory . Additional methods for improving the algorithm 's efficiency were developed in the 20th century . 
 The Euclidean algorithm has many theoretical and practical applications . It is used for reducing fractions to their simplest form and for performing division in modular arithmetic . <unk> using this algorithm form part of the cryptographic protocols that are used to secure internet communications , and in methods for breaking these <unk> by factoring large composite numbers . The Euclidean algorithm may be used to solve Diophantine equations , such as finding numbers that satisfy multiple congruences according to the Chinese remainder theorem , to construct continued fractions , and to find accurate rational approximations to real numbers . Finally , it can be used as a basic tool for proving theorems in number theory such as Lagrange 's four @-@ square theorem and the uniqueness of prime factorizations . The original algorithm was described only for natural numbers and geometric lengths ( real numbers ) , but the algorithm was generalized in the 19th century to other types of numbers , such as Gaussian integers and polynomials of one variable . This led to modern abstract algebraic notions such as Euclidean domains . 
 = = Background : greatest common divisor = = 
 The Euclidean algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor ( GCD ) of two natural numbers a and b . The greatest common divisor g is the largest natural number that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder . Synonyms for the GCD include the greatest common factor ( GCF ) , the highest common factor ( <unk> ) , and the greatest common measure ( <unk> ) . The greatest common divisor is often written as gcd ( a , b ) or , more simply , as ( a , b ) , although the latter notation is also used for other mathematical concepts , such as two @-@ dimensional vectors . 
 If gcd ( a , b ) 
 = 1 , then a and b are said to be coprime ( or relatively prime ) . This property does not imply that a or b are themselves prime numbers . For example , neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number , since they both have two prime factors : 6 = 
 2 × 3 and 35 
 = 5 × 7 . Nevertheless , 6 and 35 are coprime . No natural number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35 , since they have no prime factors in common . 
 Let g = 
 gcd ( a , b ) . Since a and b are both multiples of g , they can be written a 
 = mg and b = 
 ng , and there is no larger number G > g for which this is true . The natural numbers m and n must be coprime , since any common factor could be factored out of m and n to make g greater . Thus , any other number c that divides both a and b must also divide g . The greatest common divisor g of a and b is the unique ( positive ) common divisor of a and b that is divisible by any other common divisor c . 
 The GCD can be visualized as follows . Consider a rectangular area a by b , and any common divisor c that divides both a and b exactly . The sides of the rectangle can be divided into segments of length c , which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length c . The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible . For illustration , a 24 @-@ by @-@ 60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of : 1 @-@ by @-@ 1 squares , 2 @-@ by @-@ 2 squares , 3 @-@ by @-@ 3 squares , 4 @-@ by @-@ 4 squares , 6 @-@ by @-@ 6 squares or 12 @-@ by @-@ 12 squares . Therefore , 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60 . A 24 @-@ by @-@ 60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12 @-@ by @-@ 12 squares , with two squares along one edge ( 24 / 12 
 = 2 ) and five squares along the other ( 60 / 12 = 
 5 ) . 
 The GCD of two numbers a and b is the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers , where a same prime factor can be used multiple times , but only as long as the product of these factors divides both a and b . For example , since 1386 can be factored into 2 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 11 , and <unk> can be factored into 3 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 17 , the greatest common divisor of 1386 and <unk> equals 63 
 = 3 × 3 × 7 , the product of their shared prime factors . If two numbers have no prime factors in common , their greatest common divisor is 1 ( obtained here as an instance of the empty product ) , in other words they are coprime . A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors . Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem , and the security of many modern cryptography systems is based upon its infeasibility . 
 Another definition of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics , particularly ring theory . The greatest common divisor g of two nonzero numbers a and b is also their smallest positive integral linear combination , that is , the smallest positive number of the form ua + vb where u and v are integers . The set of all integral linear combinations of a and b is actually the same as the set of all multiples of g ( mg , where m is an integer ) . In modern mathematical language , the ideal generated by a and b is the ideal generated by g alone ( an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal , and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals ) . Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description , for instance the fact that any common divisor of a and b also divides the GCD ( it divides both terms of ua + vb ) . The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below . 
 The GCD of three or more numbers equals the product of the prime factors common to all the numbers , but it can also be calculated by repeatedly taking the GCDs of pairs of numbers . For example , 
 gcd ( a , b , c ) = 
 gcd ( a , gcd ( b , c ) ) 
 = gcd ( gcd ( a , b ) , c ) = 
 gcd ( gcd ( a , c ) , b ) . 
 Thus , Euclid 's algorithm , which computes the GCD of two integers , suffices to calculate the GCD of arbitrarily many integers . 
 = = Description = = 
 = = = Procedure = = = 
 The Euclidean algorithm proceeds in a series of steps such that the output of each step is used as an input for the next one . Let k be an integer that counts the steps of the algorithm , starting with zero . Thus , the initial step corresponds to k 
 = 0 , the next step corresponds to k = 
 1 , and so on . 
 Each step begins with two nonnegative remainders rk − 1 and rk − 2 . Since the algorithm ensures that the remainders decrease steadily with every step , rk − 1 is less than its predecessor rk − 2 . The goal of the kth step is to find a quotient qk and remainder rk that satisfy the equation 
 <formula> 
 and that have rk < rk − 1 . In other words , multiples of the smaller number rk − 1 are subtracted from the larger number rk − 2 until the remainder rk is smaller than rk − 1 . 
 In the initial step ( k 
 = 0 ) , the remainders r − 2 and r − 1 equal a and b , the numbers for which the GCD is sought . In the next step ( k = 
 1 ) , the remainders equal b and the remainder r0 of the initial step , and so on . Thus , the algorithm can be written as a sequence of equations 
 <formula> 
 If a is smaller than b , the first step of the algorithm swaps the numbers . For example , if a < b , the initial quotient q0 equals zero , and the remainder r0 is a . Thus , rk is smaller than its predecessor rk − 1 for all k ≥ 0 . 
 Since the remainders decrease with every step but can never be negative , a remainder rN must eventually equal zero , at which point the algorithm stops . The final nonzero remainder rN − 1 is the greatest common divisor of a and b . The number N cannot be infinite because there are only a finite number of nonnegative integers between the initial remainder r0 and zero . 
 = = = Proof of validity = = = 
 The validity of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two @-@ step argument . In the first step , the final nonzero remainder rN − 1 is shown to divide both a and b . Since it is a common divisor , it must be less than or equal to the greatest common divisor g . In the second step , it is shown that any common divisor of a and b , including g , must divide rN − 1 ; therefore , g must be less than or equal to rN − 1 . These two conclusions are inconsistent unless rN − 1 
 = g . 
 To demonstrate that rN − 1 divides both a and b ( the first step ) , rN − 1 divides its predecessor rN − 2 
 rN − 2 = 
 qN rN − 1 
 since the final remainder rN is <unk> rN − 1 also divides its next predecessor rN − 3 
 rN − 3 
 = qN − 1 rN − 2 + rN − 1 
 because it divides both terms on the right @-@ hand side of the equation . <unk> the same argument , rN − 1 divides all the preceding remainders , including a and b . None of the preceding remainders rN − 2 , rN − 3 , etc. divide a and b , since they leave a remainder . Since rN − 1 is a common divisor of a and b , rN − 1 ≤ g . 
 In the second step , any natural number c that divides both a and b ( in other words , any common divisor of a and b ) divides the remainders rk . By definition , a and b can be written as multiples of c : a = 
 mc and b 
 = nc , where m and n are natural numbers . Therefore , c divides the initial remainder r0 , since r0 = 
 a − <unk> 
 = mc − <unk> = 
 ( m − <unk> ) c . An analogous argument shows that c also divides the subsequent remainders r1 , r2 , etc . Therefore , the greatest common divisor g must divide rN − 1 , which implies that g ≤ rN − 1 . Since the first part of the argument showed the reverse ( rN − 1 ≤ g ) , it follows that g 
 = rN − 1 . Thus , g is the greatest common divisor of all the succeeding pairs : 
 g = 
 gcd ( a , b ) 
 = gcd ( b , r0 ) = 
 gcd ( r0 , r1 ) 
 = … = 
 gcd ( rN − 2 , rN − 1 ) = rN − 1 . 
 = = = Worked example = = = 
 For illustration , the Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor of a 
 = 1071 and b = 
 462 . To begin , multiples of 462 are subtracted from 1071 until the remainder is less than 462 . Two such multiples can be subtracted ( q0 
 = 2 ) , leaving a remainder of 147 : 
 1071 = 
 2 × 462 + 147 . 
 Then multiples of 147 are subtracted from 462 until the remainder is less than 147 . Three multiples can be subtracted ( q1 
 = 3 ) , leaving a remainder of 21 : 
 462 = 
 3 × 147 + 21 . 
 Then multiples of 21 are subtracted from 147 until the remainder is less than 21 . Seven multiples can be subtracted ( q2 
 = 7 ) , leaving no remainder : 
 147 = 
 7 × 21 + 0 . 
 Since the last remainder is zero , the algorithm ends with 21 as the greatest common divisor of 1071 and 462 . This agrees with the gcd ( 1071 , 462 ) found by prime factorization above . In tabular form , the steps are 
 = = = Visualization = = = 
 The Euclidean algorithm can be visualized in terms of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor . Assume that we wish to cover an a @-@ by @-@ b rectangle with square tiles exactly , where a is the larger of the two numbers . We first attempt to tile the rectangle using b @-@ by @-@ b square tiles ; however , this leaves an r0 @-@ by @-@ b residual rectangle <unk> , where r0 < b . We then attempt to tile the residual rectangle with r0 @-@ by @-@ r0 square tiles . This leaves a second residual rectangle r1 @-@ by @-@ r0 , which we attempt to tile using r1 @-@ by @-@ r1 square tiles , and so on . The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle , i.e. , when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly . The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle . For example , the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21 @-@ by @-@ 21 ( shown in red ) , and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462 , the dimensions of the original rectangle ( shown in green ) . 
 = = = Euclidean division = = = 
 At every step k , the Euclidean algorithm computes a quotient qk and remainder rk from two numbers rk − 1 and rk − 2 
 rk − 2 
 = qk rk − 1 + rk 
 where the magnitude of rk is strictly less than that of rk − 1 . The theorem which underlies the definition of the Euclidean division ensures that such a quotient and remainder always exist and are unique . 
 In Euclid 's original version of the algorithm , the quotient and remainder are found by repeated subtraction ; that is , rk − 1 is subtracted from rk − 2 repeatedly until the remainder rk is smaller than rk − 1 . After that rk and rk − 1 are exchanged and the process is iterated . Euclidean division reduces all the steps between two exchanges into a single step , which is thus more efficient . Moreover , the quotients are not needed , thus one may replace Euclidean division by the modulo operation , which gives only the remainder . Thus the iteration of the Euclidean algorithm becomes simply 
 rk = 
 rk − 2 mod rk − 1 . 
 = = = Implementations = = = 
 Implementations of the algorithm may be expressed in pseudocode . For example , the division @-@ based version may be programmed as 
 function gcd ( a , b ) 
 while b ≠ 0 
 t : = b ; 
 b : = a mod b ; 
 a : = t ; 
 return a ; 
 At the beginning of the kth iteration , the variable b holds the latest remainder rk − 1 , whereas the variable a holds its predecessor , rk − 2 . The step b : 
 = a mod b is equivalent to the above recursion formula rk ≡ rk − 2 mod rk − 1 . The temporary variable t holds the value of rk − 1 while the next remainder rk is being calculated . At the end of the loop iteration , the variable b holds the remainder rk , whereas the variable a holds its predecessor , rk − 1 . 
 In the subtraction @-@ based version which was Euclid 's original version , the remainder calculation ( b = 
 a mod b ) is replaced by repeated subtraction . Contrary to the division @-@ based version , which works with arbitrary integers as input , the subtraction @-@ based version supposes that the input consists of positive integers and stops when a = b : 
 function gcd ( a , b ) 
 while a ≠ b 
 if a > b 
 a : = a − b ; 
 else 
 b : 
 = b − a ; 
 return a ; 
 The variables a and b alternate holding the previous remainders rk − 1 and rk − 2 . Assume that a is larger than b at the beginning of an iteration ; then a equals rk − 2 , since rk − 2 > rk − 1 . During the loop iteration , a is reduced by multiples of the previous remainder b until a is smaller than b . Then a is the next remainder rk . Then b is reduced by multiples of a until it is again smaller than a , giving the next remainder rk + 1 , and so on . 
 The recursive version is based on the equality of the GCDs of successive remainders and the stopping condition gcd ( rN − 1 , 0 ) = 
 rN − 1 . 
 function gcd ( a , b ) 
 if b 
 = 0 
 return a ; 
 else 
 return gcd ( b , a mod b ) ; 
 For illustration , the gcd ( 1071 , 462 ) is calculated from the equivalent gcd ( 462 , 1071 mod 462 ) = 
 gcd ( 462 , 147 ) . The latter GCD is calculated from the gcd ( 147 , 462 mod 147 ) 
 = gcd ( 147 , 21 ) , which in turn is calculated from the gcd ( 21 , 147 mod 21 ) = 
 gcd ( 21 , 0 ) = 21 . 
 = = = Method of least absolute remainders = = = 
 In another version of Euclid 's algorithm , the quotient at each step is increased by one if the resulting negative remainder is smaller in magnitude than the typical positive remainder . Previously , the equation 
 rk − 2 
 = qk rk − 1 + rk 
 assumed that | rk − 1 | > rk > 0 . However , an alternative negative remainder ek can be computed : 
 rk − 2 = 
 ( qk + 1 ) rk − 1 + ek 
 if rk − 1 > 0 or 
 rk − 2 = ( qk − 1 ) rk − 1 + ek 
 if rk − 1 < 0 . 
 If rk is replaced by <unk> when | ek | < | rk | , then one gets a variant of Euclidean algorithm such that 
 | rk | ≤ | rk − 1 | / 2 
 at each step . 
 Leopold Kronecker has shown that this version requires the least number of steps of any version of Euclid 's algorithm . More generally , it has been proven that , for every input numbers a and b , the number of steps is minimal if and only if qk is chosen in order that <formula> where <formula> is the golden ratio . 
 = = Historical development = = 
 The Euclidean algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms in common use . It appears in Euclid 's Elements ( c . 300 BC ) , specifically in Book 7 ( Propositions 1 – 2 ) and Book 10 ( Propositions 2 – 3 ) . In Book 7 , the algorithm is formulated for integers , whereas in Book 10 , it is formulated for lengths of line segments . ( In modern usage , one would say it was formulated there for real numbers . But lengths , areas , and volumes , represented as real numbers in modern usage , are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length , area , or volume ; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time . ) The latter algorithm is geometrical . The GCD of two lengths a and b corresponds to the greatest length g that measures a and b evenly ; in other words , the lengths a and b are both integer multiples of the length g . 
 The algorithm was probably not discovered by Euclid , who compiled results from earlier mathematicians in his Elements . The mathematician and historian B. L. van der Waerden suggests that Book VII derives from a textbook on number theory written by mathematicians in the school of Pythagoras . The algorithm was probably known by Eudoxus of Cnidus ( about 375 BC ) . The algorithm may even pre @-@ date Eudoxus , judging from the use of the technical term <unk> ( <unk> , reciprocal subtraction ) in works by Euclid and Aristotle . 
 Centuries later , Euclid 's algorithm was discovered independently both in India and in China , primarily to solve Diophantine equations that arise in astronomy and making accurate calendars . In the late 5th century , the Indian mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata described the algorithm as the " <unk> " , perhaps because of its effectiveness in solving Diophantine equations . Although a special case of the Chinese remainder theorem had already been described by Chinese mathematician and astronomer Sun Tzu , the general solution was published by Qin <unk> in his 1247 book Shushu Jiuzhang ( <unk> Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections ) . The Euclidean algorithm was first described in Europe in the second edition of <unk> 's <unk> <unk> et <unk> ( Pleasant and enjoyable problems , 1624 ) . In Europe , it was likewise used to solve Diophantine equations and in developing continued fractions . The extended Euclidean algorithm was published by the English mathematician Nicholas <unk> , who attributed it to Roger Cotes as a method for computing continued fractions efficiently . 
 In the 19th century , the Euclidean algorithm led to the development of new number systems , such as Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers . In 1815 , Carl Gauss used the Euclidean algorithm to demonstrate unique factorization of Gaussian integers , although his work was first published in 1832 . Gauss mentioned the algorithm in his <unk> <unk> ( published 1801 ) , but only as a method for continued fractions . Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet seems to have been the first to describe the Euclidean algorithm as the basis for much of number theory . Lejeune Dirichlet noted that many results of number theory , such as unique factorization , would hold true for any other system of numbers to which the Euclidean algorithm could be applied . Lejeune Dirichlet 's lectures on number theory were edited and extended by Richard Dedekind , who used Euclid 's algorithm to study algebraic integers , a new general type of number . For example , Dedekind was the first to prove Fermat 's two @-@ square theorem using the unique factorization of Gaussian integers . Dedekind also defined the concept of a Euclidean domain , a number system in which a generalized version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined ( as described below ) . In the closing decades of the 19th century , the Euclidean algorithm gradually became eclipsed by Dedekind 's more general theory of ideals . 
 Other applications of Euclid 's algorithm were developed in the 19th century . In 1829 , Charles Sturm showed that the algorithm was useful in the Sturm chain method for counting the real roots of polynomials in any given interval . 
 The Euclidean algorithm was the first integer relation algorithm , which is a method for finding integer relations between commensurate real numbers . Several novel integer relation algorithms have been developed , such as the algorithm of Helaman Ferguson and R.W. <unk> ( 1979 ) and the LLL algorithm . 
 In 1969 , Cole and Davie developed a two @-@ player game based on the Euclidean algorithm , called The Game of Euclid , which has an optimal strategy . The players begin with two piles of a and b stones . The players take turns removing m multiples of the smaller pile from the larger . Thus , if the two piles consist of x and y stones , where x is larger than y , the next player can reduce the larger pile from x stones to x − my stones , as long as the latter is a nonnegative integer . The winner is the first player to reduce one pile to zero stones .

 = = = Bézout 's identity = = = 
 Bézout 's identity states that the greatest common divisor g of two integers a and b can be represented as a linear sum of the original two numbers a and b . In other words , it is always possible to find integers s and t such that g 
 = sa + tb . 
 The integers s and t can be calculated from the quotients q0 , q1 , etc. by reversing the order of equations in Euclid 's algorithm . Beginning with the next @-@ to @-@ last equation , g can be expressed in terms of the quotient qN − 1 and the two preceding remainders , rN − 2 and rN − 3 : 
 g = 
 rN − 1 
 = rN − 3 − qN − 1 rN − 2 . 
 Those two remainders can be likewise expressed in terms of their quotients and preceding remainders , 
 rN − 2 = 
 rN − 4 − qN − 2 rN − 3 and 
 rN − 3 
 = rN − 5 − qN − 3 rN − 4 . 
 Substituting these formulae for rN − 2 and rN − 3 into the first equation yields g as a linear sum of the remainders rN − 4 and rN − 5 . The process of substituting remainders by formulae involving their predecessors can be continued until the original numbers a and b are reached : 
 r2 = 
 r0 − q2 r1 
 r1 
 = b − q1 r0 
 r0 = 
 a − q0 b . 
 After all the remainders r0 , r1 , etc. have been substituted , the final equation expresses g as a linear sum of a and b : g = sa + tb . Bézout 's identity , and therefore the previous algorithm , can both be generalized to the context of Euclidean domains . 
 = = = Principal ideals and related problems = = = 
 Bézout 's identity provides yet another definition of the greatest common divisor g of two numbers a and b . Consider the set of all numbers ua + vb , where u and v are any two integers . Since a and b are both divisible by g , every number in the set is divisible by g . In other words , every number of the set is an integer multiple of g . This is true for every common divisor of a and b . However , unlike other common divisors , the greatest common divisor is a member of the set ; by Bézout 's identity , choosing u 
 = s and v = 
 t gives g . A smaller common divisor cannot be a member of the set , since every member of the set must be divisible by g . Conversely , any multiple m of g can be obtained by choosing u 
 = ms and v = 
 mt , where s and t are the integers of Bézout 's identity . This may be seen by multiplying Bézout 's identity by m , 
 mg 
 = <unk> + <unk> . 
 Therefore , the set of all numbers ua + vb is equivalent to the set of multiples m of g . In other words , the set of all possible sums of integer multiples of two numbers ( a and b ) is equivalent to the set of multiples of gcd ( a , b ) . The GCD is said to be the generator of the ideal of a and b . This GCD definition led to the modern abstract algebraic concepts of a principal ideal ( an ideal generated by a single element ) and a principal ideal domain ( a domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal ) .
