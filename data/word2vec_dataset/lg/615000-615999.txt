 The Histoire Naturelle had a distinctly mixed reception in the eighteenth century . Wealthy homes in both England and France purchased copies , and the first edition was sold out within six weeks . But Buffon was criticised by priests for suggesting ( in the essay Les <unk> de Nature , Volume XXXIV ) that the earth was more than 6 @,@ 000 years old and that mountains had arisen in geological time . Buffon cites as evidence that fossil sea @-@ shells had been found at the tops of mountains ; but the claim was seen as contradicting the biblical account in the Book of Genesis . Buffon also disagreed with Linnaeus 's system of classifying plants as described in Systema Naturae ( 1735 ) . In Buffon 's view , expounded in the " Premier Discours " of the Histoire Naturelle ( 1749 ) , the concept of species was entirely artificial , the only real entity in nature being the individual ; as for a taxonomy based on the number of stamens or pistils in a flower , mere counting ( despite Buffon 's own training in mathematics ) had no bearing on nature . 
 The Paris faculty of theology , acting as the official censor , wrote to Buffon with a list of statements in the Histoire Naturelle that were contradictory to Roman Catholic Church teaching . <unk> , Buffon replied that he believed firmly in the biblical account of creation , and was able to continue printing his book , and remain in position as the leader of the ' old school ' , complete with his job as director of the royal botanical garden . On Buffon 's death , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Georges Cuvier celebrated with the words " This time , the Comte de Buffon is dead and buried " . Soon afterwards , the French revolution went much further in sweeping away old attitudes to natural history , along with much else .

 The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy calls the Histoire Naturelle " Buffon 's major work " , observing that " In addressing the history of the earth , Buffon also broke with the ' counter @-@ factual ' tradition of Descartes , and presented a secular and realist account of the origins of the earth and its life forms . " In its view , the work created an " age of Buffon " , defining what natural history itself was , while Buffon 's " Discourse on Method " ( unlike that of Descartes ) at the start of the work argued that repeated observation could lead to a greater certainty of knowledge even than " mathematical analysis of nature " . Buffon also led natural history away from the natural theology of British parson @-@ naturalists such as John Ray . He thus offered both a new methodology and an empirical style of enquiry . Buffon 's position on evolution is complex ; he noted in Volume 4 from Daubenton 's comparative anatomy of the horse and the donkey that species might " transform " , but initially ( 1753 ) rejected the possibility . However , in doing so he changed the definition of a species from a fixed or universal class ( which could not change , by definition ) to " the historical succession of ancestor and descendant linked by material connection through generation " , identified by the ability to mate and produce fertile offspring . Thus the horse and donkey , which produce only sterile hybrids , are seen empirically not to be the same species , even though they have similar anatomy . That empirical fact leaves open the possibility of evolution . 
 = = = = Style = = = = 
 The botanist Sandra Knapp writes that " Buffon 's prose was so purple that the ideas themselves are almost hidden " , observing that this was also the contemporary academic opinion . She notes that some quite radical ideas are to be found in his work , but they are almost invisible , given the language they are cloaked in . She quotes Buffon 's dramatic description of the lion , which along with the engraving in her view " emphasized both the lion 's regal bearing and personality not only in his text but also in the illustration ... A reader was left in no doubt as to the importance and character of the animal . " She concludes " No wonder the cultured aristocratic public lapped it up – the text reads more like a romantic novel than a dry scientific treatise " . 
 = = = = Evolutionary thought = = = = 
 The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr comments that " In this monumental and fascinating Histoire naturelle , Buffon dealt in a stimulating manner with almost all the problems that would subsequently be raised by evolutionists . Written in a brilliant style , this work was read in French or in one of the numerous translations by every educated person in Europe " . Mayr argued that " virtually all the well @-@ known writers of the Enlightenment " were " <unk> " , and calls Buffon " the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the eighteenth century " . 
 Mayr notes that Buffon was not an " evolutionist " , but was certainly responsible for creating the great amount of interest in natural history in France . He agrees that Buffon 's thought is hard to classify and even self @-@ contradictory , and that the theologians forced him to avoid writing some of his opinions openly . Mayr argues however that Buffon was " fully aware of the possibility of ' common descent ' , and was perhaps the first author ever to articulate it clearly " , quoting Buffon at length , starting with " Not only the ass and the horse , but also man , the apes , the quadrupeds , and all the animals might be regarded as constituting but a single family " , and later " that man and ape have a common origin " , and that " the power of nature ... with sufficient time , she has been able from a single being to derive all the other organized beings " . Mayr notes , however , that Buffon immediately rejects the suggestion and offers three arguments against it , namely that no new species have arisen in historical times ; that hybrid infertility firmly separates species ; and that animals intermediate between , say , the horse and the donkey are not seen ( in the fossil record ) . 
 = The Boat Race 1996 = 
 The 142nd Boat Race took place on 6 April 1996 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Umpired by a former Blue , Mike Sweeney , Cambridge won by two @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter lengths in the second @-@ fastest time in the history of the race . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie defeated Oxford 's Isis in a record time , while Cambridge won the Women 's Boat Race . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1995 race by four lengths , with Cambridge leading overall with 72 victories to Oxford 's 68 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Up until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 The previous year 's race was watched by seven million viewers in the United Kingdom alone . Oxford coach Dan Topolski suggested that part of the appeal was that the contest was " absolutely amateur " but still " represents quality " . Former Oxford Blue and Olympic gold medallist Jonny Searle agreed , calling the Boat Race " a unique experience " . Both Topolski and Searle predicted a close race ; Cambridge coach Robin Williams agreed : " We 've got to accord Oxford some respect . I think we 're again the better crew ... but the only way to find out is on the water . " Penny Chuter , one of the other Oxford coaches , noted " Cambridge have a continuity ... but we have more power this year . " Cambridge 's boat club president John Carver had earlier withdrawn from the race with injury . Oxford 's director of rowing , Steve Royle , said of his crew : " these guys love a scrap . " 
 The 250 officers from Wandsworth Police lining the embankments were able to replace their traditional helmets for peaked caps for the first time , in order to discourage members of the crowd from removing them and throwing them into the river . The race was sponsored for the tenth consecutive year by Beefeater Gin , and umpired by former Cambridge Blue Mike Sweeney . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 1 @.@ 25 pounds ( 0 @.@ 57 kg ) more per rower than their opponents . Each crew saw just one former Blue return , Clegg for Oxford and Barnett for Cambridge , in addition to Barnett , Cambridge 's crew contained five former Goldie rowers . Oxford 's crew more international rowers with four Americans and a Canadian .

 Cambridge started as pre @-@ race favourites . They won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . After a close start , where neither boat took a significant lead , Cambridge were a half a length up at the Mile Post . They pushed on at Harrods Furniture Depository to take two thirds of a length lead over Oxford by Hammersmith Bridge . Under pressure from the Dark Blues , Whyman steered his crew to record times between the Mile Post and Barnes Bridge , Hammersmith Bridge to Barnes Bridge , Chiswick Steps to Barnes Bridge and Chiswick Steps to the finishing post . Cambridge won by two @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter lengths in a time of 16 minutes 58 seconds , the second @-@ fastest time on record ( thirteen seconds slower than the winning time in the 1984 race ) . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie won by eleven lengths , in a record time , over Isis . It was Cambridge 's ninth victory in ten years . Cambridge won the 51st Women 's Boat Race by four lengths in a time of 6 minutes and 12 seconds , their seventh victory in eight years .

 During the race , David Miller of the The Times claimed that Cambridge 's stroke James Ball " conducted a continual tactical conversation with Kevin Whyman , the Cambridge cox " . Miller suggested that while Oxford were the more powerful crew , Cambridge were technically superior . 
 Oxford coach Chuter concluded : " we did not find the cohesive and relaxed rhythm which we have had . " Her counterpart , Williams , exclaimed " you have got to be happy with that " .

 X @-@ Men Legends was announced in a press release by Activision on April 23 , 2003 . The game is Raven Software 's first console title ; after a number of successful titles for personal computers , it wanted to expand into the console market . The company developed the three console versions simultaneously , and used Vicarious Visions ' Alchemy engine as a base for the game . After deciding to make an " X @-@ Men RPG " , staff began brainstorming story , gameplay and design ideas . Raven wanted to feature a team @-@ based dynamic , something it felt was absent in previous X @-@ Men games . The original concept featured turned @-@ based gameplay , similar to a Final Fantasy game . However , the team concluded that players would prefer more action that allowed control of the character 's super powers . The genre switch proved problematic to maintaining the team aspect of gameplay . 
 The group experimented with several gameplay models , and opted for one that allowed players to freely switch characters . The final product mimics isometric dungeon crawling video games . Raven designed gameplay with strategy in mind ; each character 's abilities allow different interactions with the environment and other characters . For example , a physically strong character like Colossus can break walls but is unable to reach certain areas that require the ability to fly , and Iceman is able to freeze enemies so that other characters can easily defeat them . Staff hoped that the differences would force players to switch characters regularly during missions . Extraction points , specific locations that players can switch characters , were added to allow players to continue without a game over in the event one or more team member was defeated . Raven included flash back missions as an homage to the franchise and based some on specific comic book issues . Originally a single @-@ player game , Raven eventually incorporated simultaneous co @-@ <unk> gameplay . The developers chose to not create an online multi @-@ player mode , stating that the gameplay was " designed around localized encounters . " 
 The game 's story was penned by a group of former Marvel writers known as Man of Action , consisting of Duncan Rouleau , Joe Casey , Joe Kelly , and Steven T. <unk> , with Stan Lee consulting . Man of Action chose the character Magma as their lead because she was an " appropriately blank slate as a character . " Man of Action also stated that the script for X @-@ Men Legends was in excess of five hundred pages . The writers created a story that would allow for players to change their active team throughout the game and not affect the overall flow of the story . 
 The game 's voice cast consists largely of television and film stars as well as veteran voice actors . Patrick Stewart reprised his role as Professor Xavier from the X @-@ Men films , while Tony Jay voiced Magneto . Ed Asner lent his voice as Healer , a Morlock shaman . Lou Diamond Phillips voiced Forge , a Native American mutant whose power grants him intuitive talent for inventing mechanical devices . Danica McKellar voiced Jubilee , a young mutant who generates <unk> from her fingertips . Veteran voice actors Steven Blum , Grey DeLisle , Dee Bradley Baker , Robin Atkin Downes and Dorian Harewood also lent voices as Wolverine , Mystique , Nightcrawler , Cyclops and Shadow King , respectively . Music for the game was composed by Rik Schaffer of the Los Angeles @-@ based Womb Music . 
 Characters were selected from different time lines in the X @-@ Men universe . Art lead Brian Pelletier stated that they took the most memorable characters from the last 40 years and grouped them together . X @-@ Men Legends uses cel shading to give the characters a comic @-@ like appearance . However , Raven cited that they opted for then @-@ high resolution textures to stay away from " cartoony looking " characters . Character costumes were inspired by Marvel Comics ' Ultimate X @-@ Men . However , some of the X @-@ Men playable in X @-@ Men Legends had not appeared in the comics at the time of its release so , with permission from Marvel , Raven created unique looks for those characters . During development Raven tried visual formats for the X @-@ Men , including using their New X @-@ Men uniforms as well as removing the cel @-@ shaded look from the characters . In contrast , the back stories , relationships and personalities of the X @-@ Men were taken from Marvel 's mainstream universe . Angel was also to be included in the game , and was to be voiced by André Sogliuzzo , but was cut from the final build .

" 
 Critics generally praised the game 's use of cel @-@ shading . IGN 's Hilary Goldstein stated , " To capture the ' comic book feel , ' Raven Soft chose to go for a cel @-@ shaded look with Legends . It 's not that the characters look two @-@ dimensional , but they have very basic textures and a cut @-@ out look " . GameSpot reviewer Jeff Gerstmann pointed out that though the characters are cel @-@ shaded , the environments are not , making them easy to distinguish . The gameplay was lauded for its role @-@ playing elements , character powers and melee combat . Eurogamer praised the Xbox version 's control system for character powers and melee attacks , as well as the " fluid " combat . 
 Reviewers found that the artificial intelligence ( AI ) was lacking , and recommended the game 's multiplayer . Opinions were generally mixed on the subject of voice acting . X @-@ Play reviewer Russ Fischer called it " purely average " , though he made an exception for Patrick Stewart 's portrayal of Professor Xavier . IGN noted that while some voice acting fit the characters well , others seemed out of place . 
 The N @-@ Gage version was praised for the ability to play cooperatively using the N @-@ Gage 's bluetooth technology . Reviewers also found that the game 's graphics were " very strong " and that " everything looks amazing " . The presence of voice acting in the N @-@ Gage port was also praised , with GameSpy reviewer Justin Leeper stating the audio clips seemed to be " lifted right out of other versions " . He criticized the AI , however , for being " [ a ] bit stupid at inopportune times " and for failing to use the game 's healing abilities at important moments .

 = Toyota Center = 
 Toyota Center is an indoor arena located in downtown Houston , Texas . It is named after the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota . The arena is home to the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association , the principal users of the building , and the former home of the Houston Aeros of the American Hockey League . 
 Rockets owner Leslie Alexander first began to request a new arena in 1995 , and attempted to release the Rockets from their lease at The Summit , which ran until 2003 . However , he was denied by arena owner Chuck Watson , then @-@ owner of the Aeros , who also wanted control of a new arena . The two sides agreed to equal control over an arena in a deal signed in 1997 , but the proposal was rejected by city voters in a 1999 referendum . It was not until the city and the Rockets signed an amended agreement in 2001 , excluding the Aeros , that the proposal was accepted . 
 Construction began in July 2001 , and the new arena was officially opened in October 2003 . The total costs were $ 235 million , with the city of Houston paying the majority , and the Rockets paying for enhancements . Toyota paid US $ 100 million for the naming rights . 
 = = History = = 
 In May 1995 , several Texas sports teams , including the Houston Rockets , proposed legislation that would dedicate state tax revenue to build new arenas . Although the bill was failed in the Texas House of Representatives , Rockets owner Leslie Alexander announced he would continue to study the possibility of constructing a new arena in downtown Houston , saying the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Summit arena was too outdated to be profitable . Although the Summit 's management said they could renovate the building for a small part of the cost of a new arena , the Rockets began talks with the city of Houston on a possible location for an arena , They also negotiated with Houston Aeros and Summit owner , Chuck Watson , to release them from their contract with the Summit , which ran until 2003 . 
 As the negotiations continued into 1996 , a panel appointed by Houston mayor Bob Lanier reported that building a new arena was " essential to keep pro sports in Houston " . After Watson rejected a contract buyout proposal of $ 30 million , the Rockets filed a legal challenge against their lease , stating the " need to be able to buy out " of the lease . However , the city of Houston filed a counterclaim to force the Rockets to stay at the Summit , saying that if the Rockets did not honor their contract , then they might " have no incentive to honor any new agreement with the city of Houston to play in a new downtown sports arena " . The validity of the lease was eventually upheld , and in April 1997 , Lanier announced that the Rockets and Watson would have to agree to share control of the new arena equally , or lose access to it altogether . After both parties agreed to the terms , a bill that authorized increased taxes to pay for a new arena was signed into law in July , by then @-@ Governor George W. Bush . 
 However , after the National Hockey League decided not to consider Houston as a location for an expansion team because of the indecision over the new arena , Lanier said that he would not have a referendum in November . The Rockets began an appeal in January 1998 against the court order to stay at the Summit , but then dropped it in May , because they felt that a new arena would be ready by the time they finished their lease . In January 1999 , recently elected mayor Lee Brown guaranteed a referendum on the issue before the end of the year . After several months negotiating with the Harris County @-@ Houston Sports Authority , the Rockets finalized a deal to pay half of the constructions costs , and a referendum was set for November 2 . The deal was approved by Brown and the Houston City Council , but Watson started an opposition group against the referendum , saying the arena was " not in Houston 's interest " . On November 3 , the results of the referendum were announced , and the arena proposal was rejected by 54 % of voters . Alexander said " we never thought we would lose " and that they were " devastated by the loss " . 
 After the vote , NBA commissioner David Stern said " if there 's not a new building ... I think it 's certain that the team will be relocated . " The Houston Sports Authority had not planned to meet with the Rockets until after the 1999 – 2000 NBA season ended , but after the Rockets began to talk to other cities about relocation , they resumed talks in February 2000 . Although the Rockets continued to negotiate with Louisville , Kentucky , a funding plan for the arena in Houston was released in June . A final agreement was proposed on July 6 , and both the Rockets and mayor Brown agreed to the terms . After the city council approved the deal , the proposal was placed on the November referendum ballot . Leading up to the vote , the Rockets stressed that there would be " no new taxes of any kind " , although opponents said the new arena would raise energy consumption , and also contended that the public would pay for too much of the costs of the arena . Contributions for the campaign for the arena included donations of US $ 400 @,@ 000 from Reliant Energy , and a total of $ 590 @,@ 000 in loans and contributions from Enron and Ken Lay , who the Rockets said was a " tireless " force in the campaign . On November 8 , the arena was approved by 66 % of voters .

 According to the agreement signed , the city of Houston bought the land for the arena and an adjoining parking garage , which was near the George R.

Morris Architects , designed the 750 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 70 @,@ 000 m2 ) building , and Hunt Construction was contracted to build the arena . A building formerly owned by Houston Lighting and Power Company was demolished to make way for the arena , and two streets were closed for the duration of the construction . A groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 31 , 2001 , and construction continued for 26 months . 
 At the request of Alexander , the arena was built 32 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) below street level , so fans would not have to walk up stairs to reach their seats . To sink the arena , $ 12 million was spent to excavate 31 @,@ 500 cubic yards of dirt over four months , which was the largest excavation in Houston history . Concrete was poured for the foundation throughout the summer of 2002 , and structural work began in October .

 Mac Curtis Speedie ( January 12 , 1920 – March 5 , 1993 ) was an American football end who played for the Cleveland Browns in the All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) and National Football League ( NFL ) for seven years , and later served for two years as head coach of the American Football League 's Denver Broncos . A tall and quick runner whose awkward gait helped him deceive defenders and get open , Speedie led his league in receptions four times during his career and was selected as a first @-@ team All @-@ Pro six times . His career average of 800 yards per season was not surpassed until two decades after his retirement , and his per @-@ game average of 50 yards went unequalled for 20 years after he left the game . 
 Speedie grew up in Utah , where he overcame Perthes Disease to become a standout as a hurdler on his high school track team and a halfback on the football team . He attended the University of Utah , where he continued to excel at track and football before entering the military in 1942 during World War II . He spent four years in the service before joining the Browns in 1946 , where he played as an end opposite quarterback Otto Graham , fullback Marion Motley and fellow receiver Dante Lavelli . The Browns , a new team in the AAFC , won the league championship every year between 1946 and 1949 . The Browns merged into the NFL in 1950 after the AAFC disbanded , and Speedie continued to succeed as the team won another league championship . After two more years with the Browns , however , Speedie left the team for the Western Interprovincial Football Union ( WIFU ) amid a conflict with Paul Brown , Cleveland 's head coach . He played two full seasons in the WIFU and one game in a third season before leaving professional football . 
 Speedie was hired in 1960 as an end coach for the Houston Oilers in the American Football League ( AFL ) . The Oilers won the AFL championship that year , but Speedie left in 1961 after the head coach , former teammate Lou Rymkus , was fired . He then took a job as an assistant for the AFL 's Denver Broncos and was promoted to head coach in 1964 . His two @-@ year run with the team was unsuccessful , however . After his resignation in 1966 , Speedie became a scout for the Broncos , a job he kept until his retirement in 1982 . Despite lobbying by friends and former teammates , Speedie was not selected for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Speedie was born in Odell , Illinois , but attended high school in Utah . As a child he had Perthes Disease , a condition where growth or loss of bone mass in the hip joint affects blood supply to the area . He had to wear a brace for four years to correct the condition ; one of his legs came out shorter than the other . Despite his struggle with the disease , Speedie became a star athlete at South High School in Salt Lake City , playing football , basketball and track . He was the center on the school 's basketball team and was named to a list of Salt Lake 's best athletes as a halfback on the football team . Getting out of the braces " was like turning a frisky colt out to pasture after a year in a box stall , " Speedie once said . " I had such a backlog of athletic ambition that I wanted to play football , basketball , and track all at one time . " 
 = = College and military career = = 
 After graduating from high school , Speedie attended the University of Utah , where he majored in geology and continued to excel as an athlete . He played football and basketball and was a top college hurdler in track . As an end on the Utah Redskins football team He won all @-@ conference honors in 1939 , 1940 and 1941 . In track , he finished second in a high hurdles event where the winner , Rice University 's Fred Wolcott , set a NCAA record . 
 Like many college athletes , Speedie joined the military as America 's involvement in World War II intensified following the attack on Pearl Harbor at the end of 1941 . He entered the U.S. Army after graduating in 1942 . Speedie was stationed at Fort Warren in Wyoming and played for the base 's Broncos military team .

 = = = Cleveland Browns = = = 
 Speedie was drafted by the National Football League 's Detroit Lions in the late rounds of the 1942 draft . Fred Mandel , the owner of the Lions , visited him at Fort Warren and offered a contract worth $ 2 @,@ 800 a year . Speedie wanted to sign immediately , but Mandel preferred to wait until after the war . By the time the war drew to a close in 1945 , however , Speedie was considering signing with the Chicago Rockets , a team in the new All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) . He was pursued by the Rockets after playing well against a team at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro from which many of the Rockets ' players were drawn . Speedie was also spotted by Paul Brown , who had been the head coach of a military team at Great Lakes Naval Station that played against the Broncos . Brown , who was starting a new AAFC team called the Cleveland Browns , sent a friend named Jackie <unk> to sign Speedie for $ 7 @,@ 000 in 1946 . 
 With the Browns , Speedie quickly became an important part of an offensive attack that featured quarterback Otto Graham , fullback Marion Motley and fellow receiver Dante Lavelli . He was enthusiastic , energetic and fast , posing a challenge for defenders assigned to cover him . He had an unusual running style because of his bout with Perthes Disease , which Lavelli said " gave him an odd gait in which he could fake plays without even trying " . Speedie caught the first touchdown in the AAFC 's existence in the Browns ' opening game against the Miami Seahawks , a 44 – 0 win . The Browns ended the regular season with a 12 – 2 record , winning the AAFC West division and earning a spot in the league championship . During the week before the championship game against the New York Yankees , Speedie and two teammates , Lou Rymkus and team captain Jim Daniell were arrested after an argument with Cleveland police . Daniell was driving a car with Rymkus and Speedie as passengers as they waited for Speedie 's wife to return on a flight from Utah . A police car was blocking Daniell 's way , and he honked the horn , leading to the confrontation and arrests . Brown kicked Daniell off of the team , but Speedie and Rymkus were not punished by the team ; they were , however , held in custody for several hours and charged with creating a disturbance . 
 The Browns went on to win the championship game in 1946 , helped by Speedie 's six catches for 71 yards . Speedie led the league in yards per catch , with 23 @.@ 5 , and scored seven touchdowns . After the season , he was named along with several teammates to the AAFC 's all @-@ league team . 
 The 1947 season was another strong one for Speedie . In a game against the Buffalo Bills , he tied a professional football record by catching a throw from Graham and running 99 yards for a touchdown . He finished the season as the league leader in receptions and receiving yards as the Browns won another championship . His 67 catches and 1 @,@ 146 receiving yards , in fact , were the second @-@ best in pro football history after Don Hutson of the Green Bay Packers , who caught for 1 @,@ 211 yards in 1940 . Speedie was named by news outlets as a first @-@ team All @-@ Pro . Speedie 's success in 1947 came as he , Graham and Lavelli gelled as a passing and receiving unit , having studied hours of tape and worked on their technique and coordination . Speedie studied how defensive backs moved their feet and tried to break into the open by exploiting mis @-@ steps . They experimented with screen passes and made modifications to common receiving routes to exploit the weaknesses of defenses . 
 The Browns had a perfect season the following year , winning the championship for a third straight time . Speedie led the league in receiving and was named an All @-@ Pro again . The 1949 season brought another championship and another All @-@ Pro season for Speedie , who led the league in receptions for the third year in a row . He had 228 receiving yards in a game against the Yankees , which remains a Browns record . Tom Landry , a Yankees cornerback who went on to coach the Dallas Cowboys , was assigned to cover Speedie and called it " the most embarrassing athletic performance of my entire life " . The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season and the Browns , along with two other teams , were absorbed by the more established NFL . Speedie was the AAFC 's all @-@ time leader in receptions and receiving yards , with 3 @,@ 554 . 
 Cleveland 's success continued in the NFL in 1950 , silencing skeptics who thought the team stood out only because of the poor quality of competition in the AAFC . After beating the defending NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles in the first game of the season , the Browns advanced to the championship game , where they beat the Los Angeles Rams 30 – 28 on a last @-@ second Lou Groza field goal . Speedie had 548 receiving yards during the season and was selected for the NFL 's first @-@ ever Pro Bowl . 
 The Browns reached the NFL championship game in 1951 and 1952 , but lost both times . Speedie led the NFL in receiving in 1951 and was named a first @-@ team All Pro , but he did not play in the championship game due to an injury . He was selected for the Pro Bowl for a second time in 1952 . After that season , however , he left the Browns to join the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Western Interprovincial Football Union under acrimonious circumstances . Speedie had an independent streak that did not sit well with Brown , whose domineering coaching style grated against many of the men who played for him . " He was one of the ones that Paul Brown picked on quite a bit , " recalled former teammate Ken Carpenter . " He 'd get on Speedie 's case for no particular reason . " Speedie showed his displeasure by bringing a skunk to training camp in 1952 and calling it " Paul " . Brown told Speedie he did not think it was very funny , to which Speedie responded that it was a nocturnal animal and was named after Paul Revere . 
 The Roughriders offered Speedie double his Browns salary as the Canadian leagues tried to make names for themselves by signing top @-@ level NFL players . Paul Brown refused to match the offer , and Speedie , who was making $ 11 @,@ 000 per year with the Browns , joined the Canadian team for the 1953 season . Brown then threatened to sue Speedie for violating his existing contract with the team , saying the Browns had exercised an option to extend the deal after it expired in the summer of 1953 . " This was a case of jumping a contract , pure and simple , as this young man morally and ethically had a contract with us , " Brown said at the time . Speedie later said that Brown " told me when I jumped leagues that he was going to get even with me " . 
 = = = Western Interprovincial Football Union = = = 
 Speedie , by then 33 years old , joined the Roughriders despite the threat of legal action . Speedie had a league @-@ leading seven touchdowns in 1953 , and 576 receiving yards the following season . He was sent to the WIFU 's BC Lions in 1955 , but played only one game for the club . Speedie hurt his left knee and was declared out for the season . He had suffered a hairline leg fracture and underwent surgery on torn ligaments in his knee and ankle . He was expected to scout for the Lions as he recovered . After the injury , Speedie was cut from the Lions ' roster and did not play professional football again . 
 At the end of his career , Speedie was one of the most prolific receivers of his era . He averaged more than 800 receiving yards a season during his seven years in the AAFC and NFL , a mark that was not surpassed for 20 years after he left the game . His career receiving yards average of 49 @.@ 9 per game stood for 25 years . He was named to the National Football League 1940s All @-@ Decade Team and was selected by news outlets as a first @-@ team All @-@ Pro six times . The authors of the official NFL encyclopedia named him one of the league 's 300 greatest @-@ ever players .

 Speedie resurfaced in 1960 , when he was named the end coach for the new American Football League 's Houston Oilers under former teammate and Oilers head coach Lou Rymkus . The Oilers won the AFL championship in 1960 , but Rymkus was fired after the team got off to a slow start the following year . Team owner Bud Adams urged Speedie to stay on the staff , but Speedie resigned out of loyalty to Rymkus . 
 The AFL 's Denver Broncos hired Speedie the following year as an end coach . He served under head coach Jack Faulkner , who replaced Frank Filchock that season and was voted AFL Coach of the Year for turning the team around and posting a 7 – 7 record . Faulkner led the team to a 2 – 11 – 1 season in 1963 , however , and Speedie replaced him the following year as the Broncos went on a 14 @-@ game losing streak . 
 In Speedie 's first game leading the team , the Broncos ended the losing streak with a 33 – 27 upset victory over the Kansas City Chiefs . Two weeks later , Speedie suspended placekicker Gene Mingo and defensive back Willie West for " conduct detrimental to the club " , reportedly as a result of a late @-@ night party at a hotel . The team posted a 2 – 7 – 1 record under Speedie , and he was signed to a two @-@ year contract after the season . 
 In his first full season as the Broncos ' coach in 1965 , Speedie 's team posted a 4 – 10 record . After two losses to begin the 1966 season , Speedie resigned and assistant Ray Malavasi took over . He said the move was in the best interest of the club . Speedie had a 6 @-@ 19 @-@ 1 record as the Broncos ' coach . He then accepted a scouting position with the organization and was based out of his home in Laguna Hills , California . He held the post until his retirement in 1982 . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 Speedie had a brief and cold reunion with Brown in 1977 , when the two met at the annual East – West Shrine Game , a college all @-@ star game . Speedie introduced himself to Brown , only to be told , " Yes , I know . You 're the one who went to Canada . " Speedie 's friends and former teammates lobbied repeatedly for his inclusion in the Pro Football Hall of Fame , but Speedie believed that his conflict with Brown was keeping him out even as numerous former teammates , including Otto Graham , Dante Lavelli and Marion Motley were inducted . He was placed on an old @-@ timers ' list of nominees for induction into the hall in the mid @-@ 1980s , but ultimately was passed over . " Quite honestly , I think Paul Brown is the reason " for Speedie 's exclusion , Graham said in 1991 . " Paul wasn 't the type of guy you crossed . He would never forget it . " 
 While was passed over for professional football 's hall of fame , Speedie was inducted into the Utah Sports Hall of Fame in 1972 and the University of Utah 's Crimson Club hall of fame in 1986 . He died in California in 1993 . In 2003 , he was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association 's inaugural HOVG class .

 Final Fantasy XIV ( <unk> , Fainaru Fantajī <unk> ) , also known as Final Fantasy XIV Online , is a massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game for Microsoft Windows personal computers , developed and published by Square Enix in 2010 . It is the fourteenth entry in the main Final Fantasy series and the second MMORPG in the series after Final Fantasy XI . Set in the fantasy realm of Eorzea , players take control of a customized avatar as they explore the land and are caught up in both an invasion by the hostile Garlean Empire and the threat of the Primals , the deities of the land 's Beastmen tribes . Eventually , they are embroiled in a plot by a Garlean Legatus to destroy the Primals by bringing one of the planet 's moons down on Eorzea . 
 The game had been in development since 2005 under the codename " Rapture " , and was announced in 2009 for Windows and PlayStation 3 video game consoles . It ran on Square Enix 's Crystal Tools middleware engine , which was adjusted to suit the game 's specifications . During development , the team carried over multiple aesthetic elements from XI while creating something that stood on its own . Due to several factors , the development was beset by problems that would later have drastic effects on the game . Attempts to bring the game to Xbox 360 consoles fell through due to disagreements with Microsoft about the use of Xbox Live . 
 After its alpha test and a delayed beta test , the game went live on September 30 , 2010 ( September 30 , 2010 ) , remaining active until its servers were closed on November 11 , 2012 ( November 11 , 2012 ) . At launch , the game received a mixed to negative reaction : while the graphics and music met with general praise , other aspects were unanimously panned , including the gameplay , interface , and the general impression of the game being unfinished at launch . Critic and fan backlash caused Square Enix to pull subscription fees , indefinitely postpone the PlayStation 3 version , and eventually develop an entirely new version of the game called Final Fantasy XIV : A Realm Reborn . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Final Fantasy XIV is a massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game ( MMORPG ) in which the player controls a customized Adventurer avatar from one of the five playable races . Each race has two tribes , and all but two allow for the selection of male or female characters . The avatar can have their eye and hair color , facial features , and skin tone customized , and features such as birthmarks and scars can be added . Their chosen tribe , along with their chosen patron deity , affect their stats and elemental attributes . The game 's opening varies depending on which starting location is chosen . Two different types of quests are available for players : story quests , which are unlocked as characters accumulate experience points ( EXP ) and raise their experience level while unlocking new abilities ; and <unk> ( leves ) , side quests accessed through the Adventurers ' Guilds . Leves are broken down into multiple types , focusing on gathering or combat . <unk> are associated with particular non @-@ playable characters ( NPCs ) . As the player completes leves , they gain favor with three different factions and unlock new abilities , with rewards only coming from the NPCs within the factions who issued the quest . Gaining favor also unlocks a new type of level called Faction leves , which deplete a character 's favor when completed . 
 Compared to Final Fantasy XI , where party @-@ based gameplay is forefront at all times , the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so that players can go for longer periods without joining a party . There is no auto @-@ attack option , with each action needing a manual input while an enemy is targeted . Each action uses up a stamina bar . Through defeating monsters , crafting items , and completing quests , players accumulate EXP which , when a certain threshold is reached , automatically increments the player 's level . The player 's level affects attributes such as HP ( health / hit points ) , MP ( magic / mana points ) , and the number of abilities available to them . 
 Under the Armory System , a character 's equipped weapon or crafting tool , determines the player 's character class , allowing them to switch roles at will . Some classes are associated with a particular starting point . Classes are divided into four disciplines : Disciples of War , masters of physical combat ; Disciples of Magic , practitioners of the magical arts ; Disciples of the Hand , crafters and <unk> who synthesize and repair items ; and Disciples of the Land , gatherers who collect resources from the environment . Certain abilities learned under one class may be equipped and used by other classes . The Job System ( a post @-@ launch addition ) builds upon the Armoury System for Disciples of War and Magic . In exchange for restricting the range of equippable abilities from other classes , players gain access to powerful skills , magic , weapons , and armor exclusive to the Job corresponding to that class . These Jobs , based on classic Final Fantasy character jobs , are more suited to party @-@ based combat .

 = = = Setting and characters = = = 
 Final Fantasy XIV takes place in a high fantasy setting . The main location is Eorzea , a continent on the larger planet Hydaelyn : this contrasts Final Fantasy XI which uses one name to refer to the entire world and its regions . Eorzea is broken up between three main powers : the forest nation of Gridania ; the desert @-@ based Ul 'dah sultanate ; and the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa , Eorzea 's dominant maritime power . Other important locations include the scholarly city @-@ state of <unk> and the Garlean Empire , a hostile northern power with highly developed technology . Five years prior to the start of the game , the Garlean Empire invaded the land of Ala <unk> , but were prevented from conquering Eorzea by the attacks of the ancient dragon <unk> and his dragon hordes . In response to the Empire 's threat , the three nations of Eorzea reform the Grand Companies , comprehensive centers of command which combine the cities ' military and economic assets . The Grand Companies attracted people from all walks of life , who take up the mantle of Adventurers . 
 The player character is a customizable Adventurer avatar taken from the five main races of Eorzea . The playable races are the human @-@ like <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , the elf @-@ like <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , the physically @-@ imposing <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , the diminutive <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , and the feline <unk> 'te ( <unk> , <unk> ) . Playable <unk> and <unk> 'te are gender @-@ locked to male and female respectively . Aside from these races are the Beastmen , tribes who worship ancient gods called the Primals , which require aether @-@ rich crystals and whose presence damages the planet . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Beginning in one of Eorzea 's three main states , the player character awakes to the Echo , a power granting them the ability to see the past . The Adventurers are initially involved in both conflicts within the nations provoked by the Garlean pretense , led by the Garlean Legatus Gaius Van <unk> , and the Beastmen 's attempts to summon their Primals and their consequent hoarding of crystal supplies . Eventually , a greater threat is brought to the attention of the nations by the <unk> scholar Louisoix <unk> : another Garlean Legatus named Nael Van <unk> is using arcane magic and technology to summon Dalamud , the planet 's second moon , down on Eorzea to purge the Beastmen and Primals . With the aid of Garlean defector Cid nan <unk> , the Adventurers discover that Nael has set up a beacon for summoning Dalamud in the new fortress of Castrum Novum . While each nation makes individual attempts to storm the fortress , they are repelled . Faced with this , their leaders form a pact and unite the nations under the banner of the Eorzean Alliance . 
 Now united , the nations , aided by Adventurers , successfully storm Castrum Novum and destroy the beacon . Nael , insanely committed to his plan , makes himself into a second beacon . Though he is defeated by the Adventurers , Dalamud has descended too far for it to return into orbit , so Louisoix proposes a final desperate plan : to summon the Twelve , Eorzea 's deities , and return Dalamud into orbit . The Adventurers pray to altars dedicated to the Twelve across the land , then rally with the armies of the Eorzean Alliance to fight Nael 's legion on the <unk> Flats , the predicted impact site of Dalamud . In the midst of the battle , Dalamud disintegrates and reveals itself to have been a prison for the Elder Primal Bahamut . Enraged after its imprisonment , Bahamut begins laying waste to Eorzea . After the attempt to summon the Twelve fails , Louisoix uses the last of his power to send the Adventurers into a time rift , separating them from the flow of time so they can return when Eorzea has recovered . Louisoix then proceeds to sacrifice himself to destroy Bahamut in a final cataclysmic battle , leaving behind a barren , scarred landscape .

 Planning for Final Fantasy XIV began in 2005 , four years prior to its official announcement . At the time , it was codenamed " Rapture " ( <unk> , <unk> ) . While it had been decided within the company that MMORPGs would be mainline entries rather than spin @-@ offs , the team was worried that the final product would be too radical for the main numbered series . The main staff included multiple developers who had worked on previous entries in the Final Fantasy series : producer Hiromichi Tanaka had acted as the original producer for Final Fantasy XI and been involved in multiple early Final Fantasy games , director Nobuaki Komoto was a director for XI and had been among the staff of Final Fantasy IX , writer <unk> Sato had been the main scenario writer for XI , and Akihiko Yoshida had previously also been art director for Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII . The game 's logo and some other artwork was designed by Yoshitaka Amano . 
 The game 's story , primarily written by Sato , was based around a central narrative complemented by side @-@ stories . The setting and gameplay were decided upon before Sato was brought on board , with the result that she needed to consult the rest of the team when she wished to use one of Eorzea 's main locations in a certain way . The story 's main conflict was to be between the five main races of Eorzea and the Beastmen , with the Garlean Empire acting as a third force . The placement of the Garlean Empire to the northeast of Eorzea was not meant to simulate a real @-@ world location , but naturally ended up there as the map of Hydaelyn was being created . The game 's logo , designed by Amano , was designed around the importance of weapons and the concept of a wheel : the " wheel " in question was a wheel of adventurers , arranged so their backs were exposed and they needed to rely on their comrades and friends for support . 
 For his work as art director , Yoshida needed to adjust from working on a single static project to creating artwork assets for a game which would be updated and expanded . While the game world was created around a high fantasy aesthetic , it was meant to be realistic and encourage exploration . At the beginning of development , the team created a detailed profile of Hydaelyn , including its relation with other planets , ecosystems , climate , and geography . This was done to promote a sense of realism . Alongside creating a seamless travel experience for players , careful work was put into the topography and varied lighting of environments so they would not seem repetitive . After the environment was created , the architectural , cultural and religious elements of the world were incorporated into the environment . City and machine designs mixed metallic and natural materials to create a combined sense of wonder and familiarity for players . The game 's five playable races were directly based on the five initial races from Final Fantasy XI , with design adjustments to reflect the new setting . The developers also created two different tribes , as opposed to the single tribe set @-@ up present in XI . Characters ' movements were primarily developed using motion capture , though the recorded movements were then adjusted so they would be sharp and distinctive . Much work was invested in creating emotes , character movements chosen by the player to represent a specific mood or emotion previously used in XI . To create realistic expressions , a character artist manually adjusted the faces for each expression . For the monsters , advances in hardware enabled the team to create more realistic and detailed character models , including detailed skin textures and carefully placed hair follicles . 
 The game 's cutscenes were first drafted using a storyboard , then when the sequence of events had been finalized , motion capture was used to create the scene in a digitized format . Lighting and environmental effects were then put in place . One of the most challenging sequences to create was the opening real @-@ time cutscene for the Limsa Lominsa story route : the giant sea serpent 's fins were each individually animated . The game 's opening cinematic was produced by Visual Works , Square Enix 's in @-@ house CGI development company . All the in @-@ game models were first created in high @-@ resolution form using a 3D sculpturing program , then readjusted so they could appear in the game with a lower polygon count but equivalent graphical quality . Another large part of creating the characters was their accessories : to help with this , the team developed a multi @-@ layered development system . A technique dubbed " polygon shaving " was used so two sets of equipment could be designed to look different while using the same model data . Another function dubbed " reshaping " was used to adjust the shapes of equipment and accessories . The third element , dubbed " SSD @-@ file " , enabled the adjustment of the " materials " equipment was made off , so its color and texture could be changed . Rather than relying on a single design image , which would have been impractical for the hardware , the team took basic art and used Photoshop to add subtle changes to each . It was then passed down to the modeling team , who used the same sculpting process as was used for the game 's monsters to create high @-@ detail models while keeping the polygon count low . 
 The game 's engine was Crystal Tools , a specially @-@ created middleware engine that was also used in Final Fantasy XIII . So that it would be compatible with the game 's specifications , the team customized the engine to suit their needs . In the end , the game 's chosen engine proved unsuitable to the needs of the game , rendering its internal structure " broken " . The game 's development ended up being beset with multiple problems . According to a later postmortem , the team developing the game had an unhealthy obsession of graphical quality over gameplay content that led to other parts of the game being neglected , reinforced by the company 's then @-@ outdated development methods . A cited example of the focus on graphics was a flowerpot , which had as many polygons and lines of shader code as a player character . This high graphical quality meant that compromises needed to be made ; for example , the number of players present on @-@ screen at any one time needed to be limited to twenty , undermining the large @-@ scale communal appeal of MMORPGs . This issue also impacted the game 's environments ; to save on memory space while preserving seamless travel , the team needed to reuse environmental features and textures on a regular basis . Another problem was that the team lacked experience in developing MMORPGs , a problem that had also beset Final Fantasy XI , but had been successfully overcome . With this in mind , the team were still using the development mindset used during the sixth console generation , which could not hold up under the increased staff and resource needs for seventh generation development . A third major reason was the company 's belief that the game 's problems could be patched after the initial launch , compounded by the lack of an overall plan for how to deal with them . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music for Final Fantasy XIV was composed by Nobuo Uematsu , a regular contributor to the music of the Final Fantasy series . Originally contracted to create the ending theme for XIII , Uematsu accepted the request by the XIV team to work on the game , leaving XIII 's theme song to be composed by Masashi Hamauzu . Having only contributed a few tunes to Final Fantasy XI , XIV was Uematsu 's first full @-@ time work on an MMORPG . Despite this , he treated as any other project , and had considerable creative freedom as the team 's vision for the game had not been finalized . For the battle themes , he used a mix of orchestral and rock pieces . He worked on XIV at the same time as working on The Last Story , a video game from original Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi . During the time XIV was active after the initial release , other composers including Masayoshi Soken , Naoshi Mizuta , Tsuyoshi Sekito and Ryo Yamazaki contributed to the score . Soken acted as the game 's sound director , and would take over as the main composer for its relaunch . The game 's theme song , " Answers " , was composed by Uematsu and sung by Susan Calloway , who was specially chosen by Uematsu after hearing her rendition of previous Final Fantasy theme songs . 
 Multiple albums featuring music from XIV have been released . Two mini @-@ albums , Final Fantasy XIV : Battle Tracks and Final Fantasy XIV : Field Tracks , were released on September 29 , 2010 . A full album , Final Fantasy XIV - Eorzean Frontiers , was released on September 1 , 2012 as both a single album and three mini @-@ albums . A Blu @-@ ray album featuring all music from the original version of XIV , Before Meteor : Final Fantasy XIV Original Soundtrack , was released on August 14 , 2013 , two weeks prior to its relaunch .

 XIV was first hinted at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) when Square Enix announced that they were developing a new MMORPG , showing it off using a tech demo . The demo included aesthetic elements similar to XI , such as races from Vana 'diel . In 2006 , rumors emerged that Square Enix was developing a direct sequel to Final Fantasy XI , but further details remained unknown . During the next few years , contradictory reports were issued as to what platforms the game was being developed for : the platforms listed varied from the game being an Xbox 360 exclusive , to being for PlayStation platforms , to being for Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) and Windows platforms . XIV was officially announced at E3 2009 for PS3 , then for Windows . After its official announcement for those platforms , it was stated that a port to Microsoft hardware was under consideration . Despite negotiation with Microsoft concerning an Xbox 360 version of the game , the two companies were unable to agree upon the use of Xbox Live , as Square Enix wanted a shared server across all platforms and Microsoft would not give them the full access necessary to implement this . Because of this disagreement and the consequent extra manpower needed to develop a version separate from the other two platforms , development on the Xbox 360 version was stopped . 
 According to Yoichi Wada , then @-@ CEO of Square Enix , XIV was being planned as a serious rival to successful western MMORPG World of Warcraft . The game was developed primarily for Windows , and was then ported across to PS3 . XIV was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on Windows and PS3 in 2010 , but the PS3 version was delayed into 2011 . This was explained as due to it taking longer than expected to make the adjustments needed so the game could fit within the console 's limited memory . The game did not use the PlayOnline service used for XI . This was explained as being due to the marked decrease of content on the service . Instead , they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross @-@ platform gameplay , including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off . In October 2009 , the game 's Beta release was announced as being only for Windows . First print runs of the PS3 version of Final Fantasy XIII contained a bonus code for the PS3 version of XIV for a special in @-@ game item . 
 Due to earlier recurring issues with mistranslations related to news updates , the team decided not to implement forums in the original release , instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums . Also because of mistranslation fears , dedicated teams in each of the game 's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team . The game 's first closed Alpha test began on March 11 , 2010 . It was available only to veteran players from XI . During alpha testing , the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game , such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run at a slow frame rate . The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31 , but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game . The Beta test eventually went live on September 2 , running until the game 's release later that month . It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period . The game released on September 30 , 2010 , six months prior to the PS3 version 's projected release date of March 2011 . A Collector 's Edition was released on September 22 , allowing owners to log in to the game from that date . The Collector 's Edition , which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida , came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes documentary , a security token , a case for the game 's box , and a decorated tumbler . The game was released with text in Japanese , English , French and German , while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions . 
 = = Reception = = 
 During its debut week in Japan , the Collector 's Edition reached # 2 in the PC games charts behind Civilization 5 and ahead of StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty . In the UK charts , the game debuted at # 10 behind multiple other games including F1 2010 ( # 1 ) , Halo : Reach ( # 2 ) , Civilization 5 ( # 4 ) and Prince of Persia : The Forgotten Sands ( # 7 ) . By November 2010 , the game had sold 603 @,@ 000 copies worldwide . 
 The game received generally negative reviews at release , garnering scores of 50 % and 49 / 100 by aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively . Computer and Video Games said " Eorzea is a beautiful world with huge potential for vast adventures , but it 's just a shame that this first voyage into it is such a mis @-@ step " . 1UP.com said that " playing [ Final Fantasy XIV ] is like playing with a toy stuck in a plastic bag : it can be fun for a while and you can get the general idea , but you can 't appreciate the full experience " , stating that future updates would likely rectify this issue . IGN said that " Much of the promise of the combat system and depth of the crafting mechanics are drowned , unfortunately , under a sea of interface and performance issues that hinder the experience at nearly every step " , further stating that while patches might improve the experience , its state at the time of the review made it " not a world worth visiting " . GameSpot , in addition to warning players away from the game , said that " Final Fantasy XIV is a notable entry to the genre but only for what it lacks " . 
 GameTrailers was particularly critical , saying that it had been " released before it was finished " , calling it " [ a ] broken , incomplete mess " . PC Gamer called the game " a shallow , slow , grind @-@ heavy MMO crippled by a horrible interface and nonsensical player limitations " . GameSpy was again highly critical , saying that " barring a complete overhaul of the user interface , the combat , the player interaction mechanics , the progress system , and of the layout of the world itself , [ Final Fantasy XIV ] is unlikely to ever be fun . " Eurogamer said that while the game would appeal to some players , they advised them to " wait another six months before even thinking about Final Fantasy XIV , because Square Enix hasn 't yet got its head around its own players " . 
 Critics agreed that the game 's graphics were good , enjoyed Uematsu 's score , and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems . Alongside this , unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace , its convoluted interface , bugs and glitches , and the slow pace of the story . It was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series . Later , as part of an interview concerning the game 's later development , 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into something more playable . 
 = = Post @-@ release = = 
 The release of the game sparked immediate player backlash in addition to its negative critical reception . Some of the controversy was produced by the use of gameplay features unusual for the genre . The main complaint by players was the user interface , followed by problems with the performance and aspects of gameplay . The initial 30 @-@ day free trial was extended twice in order to allow players to experience the new development team 's updates before committing to the game . In December 2010 , it was announced that Tanaka and Komoto had been removed from their posts as producer and director , with Tanaka taking full responsibility for the game 's problems . The PS3 version was indefinitely delayed from its original March 2011 release date , with Square Enix saying that it would not release the game for that platform until it fully met the quality standards suitable for the Final Fantasy series . Subscriptions for the Windows version were also suspended indefinitely . 
 The position of producer and director was taken over by Naoki Yoshida , a staff member at Square Enix who had previously worked on the Dragon Quest series . Amongst these were other staff changes : Komoto was reassigned to become lead game designer , Akihiko Yoshida became lead scenario concept artist , Hiroshi Takai was appointed as lead artist , and Akihiko Matsui became lead combat system designer . Yoshida 's main priority was to make the game a playable experience after the poor launch and subsequent reaction . Through subsequent patches to the game , multiple graphical and gameplay improvements were made : among the most notable were the addition of a job system , personal chocobos , a revamped battle system , greater customization options for gear , and multiple new dungeons and bosses . Yoshida also introduced the official Final Fantasy XIV forums in order to obtain player feedback and suggestions , and stated that interacting with and growing closer to the community would be a high priority . During this period , XIV and XI were taken offline to help with energy conservation in the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami . They went back online one week later as other means were found to reduce their energy usage that did not involve their online services . Due to the earthquake , a planned and partially @-@ developed boss battle with the Primal Titan was cut and replaced by another Primal : the team felt that players might be offended by the Primal and associate <unk> 's links with the power of earth in this context . 
 The team could not fully mend the game in its existing form as its engine and server structure were already critically flawed . This meant that , in order to save XIV , the entire game needed to be rebuilt from the ground up . The decision to launch a new version as a reboot instead of a whole new title was driven by the need to regain player trust , which was felt would not be done by just scrapping XIV . The original story planned for XIV was changed to build up towards the end of the original game 's life , with new boss battles being introduced leading up to the final storyline . The " Seventh Umbral Era " storyline was used as a story @-@ based reason for the radical changes coming to the game and its landscape . In the run @-@ up to this , reduced subscription fees were reintroduced with special bonuses included for the eventual reboot of the game , and major server merges were carried out to ease the transition between versions of the game , a move which initially provoked a negative reaction for players . The final revision of the game was put out on November 1 , 2012 . After a final in @-@ game battle where all XIV players were invited , the servers were closed down on November 11 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The flawed release and poor reception of the game had a heavy impact on Square Enix : citing XIV among other reasons , the company reduced its projected income for the year by 90 % . At the 2011 Tokyo Game Show , Wada issued an official apology for the quality of the game , saying that " the Final Fantasy brand [ had ] been greatly damaged " . The company and development team eventually decided to scrap the current version of XIV , rebuilding it from the ground up . This rebooted version , initially titled Final Fantasy XIV 2 @.@ 0 , began development in April 2011 . The rebooted version was released in 2013 as Final Fantasy XIV : A Realm Reborn , and has been positively received by critics and players . Yoshida , commenting in a later interview , stated that A Realm Reborn was just the first part of regaining player trust after the release of XIV , predicting that the process would take a long time . 
 = Simpsons Bible Stories = 
 " Simpsons Bible Stories " is the eighteenth episode of The Simpsons ' tenth season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on Easter Sunday , April 4 , 1999 . It is the first of The Simpsons ' now annual trilogy episodes , and consists of four self @-@ contained segments . In the episode , the Simpson family fall asleep during a sermon in church . Marge dreams that she and Homer are Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden , Lisa dreams that she and her fellow Springfield Elementary School students are Hebrew slaves in Ancient Egypt and guides Moses to lead them to freedom , Homer dreams that he is King Solomon called to resolve a dispute between Lenny and Carl over the ownership of a pie , and Bart dreams he is King David , who has to fight Goliath 's son , Goliath II . 
 " Simpsons Bible Stories " was written by Matt Selman , Larry Doyle and Tim Long , and was the first episode Nancy Kruse directed for The Simpsons . While executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully stated that the idea for the episode came after Fox requested an Easter @-@ themed episode , co @-@ writer Selman argued that it was conceived by former staff writers Dan Greaney and Donick Cary while they were pitching ideas for the tenth season . Because the episode mostly takes place outside Springfield , the animators had to design completely new sets . While the episode mostly features references to the Old Testament and Christianity , it also parodies children 's television programs , American politicians and action films by Jerry Bruckheimer . 
 In its original broadcast , the episode was seen by approximately 12 @.@ 2 million viewers , a drop from the previous episode which garnered 15 @.@ 5 million viewers . Following its broadcast , the episode received mixed reviews from critics , but won an Annie award in the category of Best Animated Television Production . In 2007 , the episode was released as part of The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set , and a promotional poster for the episode was included in an exhibition in Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa , Oklahoma . The episode 's ending scene is one of series creator Matt Groening 's favorite moments on The Simpsons . The episode has been credited with fostering a critical literacy towards religion and the Bible among its viewers .

 Marge dreams that she and Homer are Adam and Eve . They peacefully live in the Garden of Eden until a snake ( Snake Jailbird ) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the forbidden tree . He persuades Eve to try one when God ( Ned Flanders ) witnesses his sin . Even though Adam ate many apples , God only caught Eve eating an apple , and she is therefore banished from the Garden of Eden . Adam is unwilling to come clean , but misses Eve and thinks of a way of getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals . God 's unicorn , named Gary , becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden . The death of the unicorn enrages him further , and he expels them both from the Garden of Eden .

 Lisa imagines she and all the other Springfield Elementary students are Hebrews in ancient Egypt , with the Pharaoh ( Principal Skinner ) making them build a pyramid . Only Moses ( Milhouse ) can liberate the Hebrews . When Bart defaces the Pharaoh 's sarcophagus , supposedly incited by the burning bush , he gets the other students punished . Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites ; they fail . This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison . When they escape , Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave . When they reach the sea , Lisa has an idea to get across : They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians ' toilets to drain the sea . As they cross , the Pharaoh and his guards follow , but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them . They enjoy splashing each other , and then return to the shore . Pleased that they have escaped , Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites , but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years . Milhouse then asks if it is going to be smooth sailing for the Jews after that . Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti @-@ Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries , she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna .

 " Simpsons Bible Stories " was co @-@ written by Matt Selman , Larry Doyle and Tim Long , and was the first episode Nancy Kruse directed for The Simpsons . It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 4 , 1999 , the day Easter took place that year . According to executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully , the idea for the episode was conceived when Fox requested an Easter @-@ themed Simpsons episode that would air on the holiday . Normally , Fox would not broadcast any new Simpsons episodes on Easter , as it is considered a " low @-@ ratings night " , but " Simpsons Bible Stories " was an exception . However , according to co @-@ writer Selman , the idea for the episode came about when he and former staff writer Dan Greaney were pitching episode ideas for the tenth season with former staff writer Donick Cary . Cary and Greaney suggested a " bible @-@ trilogy " story , which then became " Simpsons Bible Stories " . " Simpsons Bible Stories " is the first of the trilogy episodes which , since the season 12 episode " Simpsons Tall Tales " , The Simpsons produces once every season . 
 The first segment was written by Long . According to former staff writer Tom Martin , Long wanted the pig in the garden of Eden to have a " Tony British " accent . The pig was voiced by regular cast member Hank Azaria , who portrays Moe Szyslak among other characters in the series . The unicorn that digs a hole from the garden of Eden was portrayed by Tress MacNeille . The second segment was written by Doyle . The episode 's third segment was written by Selman . When writing segments for trilogy episodes , the writing staff usually follow the stories they are based on , while putting The Simpsons characters in the original characters ' place . With " Simpsons Bible Stories " ' third segment , Selman stated that he wanted to go a " fresh new way " by instead writing a sequel to the story of David and Goliath . According to Scully , Selman had a very clear vision of how he wanted the segment to be , and Selman said that he wanted to make a " dog 's breakfast " of movie clichés at the time . 
 The song that plays during Bart 's training montage is " Winner Takes It All " by American rock singer Sammy Hagar . Selman decided to include the song after hearing it in the 1987 action drama film Over the Top . According to Doyle , the scene was originally much longer , almost seven minutes in length . The song that plays during the episode 's end credits is " Highway to Hell " by Australian hard rock band AC / DC . According to Scully , the staff could not use the song on The Simpsons at first , since AC / DC 's record company refused to sell it . However , when Scully called the band 's manager directly , it turned out he had not been told about the request . Scully said that when they asked if they could use " Highway to Hell " , the band 's manager " signed on right away " and gave the Simpsons staff a " huge discount . " 
 Because most of the episode takes place in ancient history , the animators had to create completely new sets and designs for the episode . In the DVD commentary for the episode , Kruse stated that she and staff animator Alex Ruiz had to re @-@ draw a majority of the episode , as the faulty scenes were drawn by six trainees . In order to receive an animator credit on The Simpsons , an animator has to draw ten scenes in an episode . Because the trainees did not draw ten scenes each , none of them were credited for their work on the episode . All the trainees were later hired to The Simpsons animation staff . Kruse stated that , while animating the episode , she was worried that the animation department would be offended by the episode 's content , as many of the crew members were " very religious " . However , as animation ensued , she found that most of the animators were not uncomfortable with the episode , as it mostly parodies the Old Testament . The only complaint she received was from an animator who refused to animate Jesus in the court room scene in Homer 's dream . 
 In the DVD commentary for the episode , Scully stated that he regretted not submitting " Simpsons Bible Stories " for the Primetime Emmy Award in the category of animated programming less than one hour in 1999 . At the time , Scully reasoned that , because the original stories were not conceived by the writing staff , the episode would not hold up . However , he noted that the episode 's animation was " outstanding " , and that he later found out that the Emmy awards " put a lot of importance on " the animation in submitted episodes . Instead of submitting " Simpsons Bible Stories " for the Emmy awards in 1999 , Scully submitted " Viva Ned Flanders " , which ultimately lost to the King of the Hill episode " And They Call It Bobby Love " . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 " Simpsons Bible Stories " contains several references to the Christian prophets , holy book and the religion as a whole , as well as films based on the Bible . Each segment is based on a biblical story , mostly from the Old Testament . The first segment is based on the story of Adam and Eve , who , according to the Book of Genesis were the first man and woman created by God . Ned Flanders has the role of God , while the serpent that lures Marge into eating an apple from the forbidden tree resembles Snake Jailbird . The Garden of Eden was the place where Adam and Eve lived after they were created by God , according to the Book of Genesis . 
 The second segment parodies Moses who , according to the Book of Exodus , freed the Israelites from the Egyptian Pharaoh . Milhouse has the role of Moses while Skinner has the role of the Pharaoh . When the Pharaoh asked who vandalized his sarcophagus , the burning bush tells him that Bart did it . When Bart is seized by the Pharaoh 's guards , he exclaims " No , the bush set me up ! " Bart 's line refers to the 1990 arrest of Marion Barry who , while being arrested by the FBI for smoking crack cocaine , exclaimed " No , the bitch set me up ! " In a scene in the segment , Milhouse and Lisa can be seen pouring frogs into Skinner 's tent . The scene refers to the second of ten Biblical plagues that were imposed on Egypt by Yahweh , in chapters 7 @-@ 12 of the Book of Exodus . While they are inside the torture chamber , Milhouse and Lisa walk past an orb . The orb is called " Orb of Isis " and played a big part in the season 9 episode " Lost Our Lisa " . In another scene , Milhouse parts the Red Sea so that his fellow slaves can escape . The execution of the scene is based on the one seen in the 1956 American epic film The Ten Commandments , in which Moses parts the Red Sea . The shot in which Pharaoh and his guards are drowning is also taken from the movie . 
 In Homer 's dream , Homer has the role of King Solomon who , according to the Books of Kings and Book of Chronicles was a King of Israel , as well as one of the 48 prophets according to the Talmud . Bart 's dream shows Bart as King David and , rather than telling the story of David and Goliath , Bart 's dream is a " sequel " to the story . The segment is inspired by and contains references to several films by Jerry Bruckheimer , including Die Hard and Lethal Weapon , and borrows elements from other action films . At one point in the segment , Bart 's dog Santa 's Little Helper starts talking to him . The dog 's voice is similar to that of Goliath in the Christian stop @-@ motion animated television series Davey and Goliath . Inside the whale skeleton in the episode , Bart finds the remains of Jonah . Jonah was a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel , according to the Hebrew Bible . Nelson lives in the Tower of Babel which , according to the Book of Genesis , was an enormous tower that the humans built in order to reach heaven . After being defeated by Bart , Nelson reappears while a variation of Modest Mussorgsky 's composition St. John 's Night on the Bare Mountain plays in the background . At the end of the segment , Bart is arrested and Chief Wiggum says " Where 's your messiah now ? " Wiggum 's line was also taken from The Ten Commandments , from a character played by Edward G. Robinson , on whom Wiggum 's voice is based . King David 's ( Bart ) training montage of arm @-@ wrestling with his sheep is a reference to the film Over the Top , complete with Sammy Hagar 's " Winner Takes It All " from the film .

 In its original American broadcast on April 4 , 1999 , " Simpsons Bible Stories " received a 7 @.@ 4 Nielsen rating , translating to approximately 7 @.@ 4 million viewers . The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show , but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 12 @.@ 2 million viewers watched the episode , a considerable drop from the previous episode , which was seen by an estimated 15 @.@ 5 million viewers . David Bianculli of New York Daily News attributed the loss in viewership to the fact that the episode aired on a religious holiday . Nevertheless , it was the week 's second most watched program on the network . Later that year , the episode received an Annie award in the category of Best Animated Television Production , the second year in a row that The Simpsons won the award . On August 7 , 2007 , " Simpsons Bible Stories " was released as part of The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set . Matt Groening , Mike Scully , George Meyer , Tom Martin , Larry Doyle , Matt Selman and Nancy Kruse participated in the DVD 's audio commentary of the episode . 
 Following its broadcast , " Simpsons Bible Stories " received mixed reviews from critics . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide wrote that the episode is " A fantastic twist of the Treehouse of Horror style of storytelling , " and added that each segment is a " classic on its own " . They wrote that Wiggum telling Moses and Lisa to give his regards to the British Museum as he seals them inside a tomb and Marge asking Bart if he is wearing clean underwear as they face the apocalypse were some of the episode 's " best moments " , and concluded by writing that the episode is " The Simpsons at its very best : inventive , irreverent and very , very funny . " While DVD Town 's James Plath wrote that the episode 's premise was " risky " , he still enjoyed the episode . Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star @-@ Ledger described the episode as " hilarious " , however they noted that the episode 's " suggestion that Moses parted the Red Sea by having all the Israelites flush their toilets at once " could result in a backlash from the " religious right " . 
 On the other hand , giving the episode a negative review , DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson wrote that " Simpsons Bible Stories " " proves less successful [ than most Treehouse of Horror episodes ] " . He added that he " just think the brevity required by the inclusion of three separate tales better suits the world of horror spoofs than it does these Bible pieces , " as they " try to pack an awful lot into very little time . " He concluded by writing that , while the episode has " some good moments " , he did not find a lot of entertainment in it . Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News was also critical , and wrote that the episode " fails to be funny " because it " strays too far from the source material " . He added " have you read the bible ? That stuff ’ s funny enough in and of itself . " Aaron Roxby of Collider described " Simpsons Bible Stories " as his least @-@ favorite trilogy episode , and wrote " Considering that , in earlier seasons , the show had some of the most thoughtfully edgy religious humor on television , this one feels surprisingly toothless . " However , he gave praise to the talking pig in the Garden of Eden . 
 At the end of the episode , the Simpsons walk out of the church and notice that the Apocalypse has begun . While the other family members are left on earth , Lisa at first starts ascending into Heaven , but Homer stops her by grabbing her leg and says " Where do you think you 're going , <unk> ? " The gag was written by staff writer George Meyer , and is series creator Matt Groening 's favorite joke of the series . While the episode 's ending is one of Groening 's favorites , fans were uneasy with it . Selman stated that the ending " drives them [ the fans ] crazy " , since they do not know whether or not the episode is canonical . In 2007 , Homer 's line " Oh , I smell barbeque ! " was included in Bobby Bryant of The State 's list " 20 Essential Things I 've Learned From Homer Simpson " . The same year , the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa , Oklahoma , unveiled a new exhibit which galleried Biblical images in art and pop culture , including a promotional poster for " Simpsons Bible Stories " . 
 = Crocodiles ( album ) = 
 Crocodiles is the debut album by the English post @-@ punk band Echo & the Bunnymen . It was released on 18 July 1980 in the United Kingdom and on 17 December 1980 in the United States . The album reached number 17 on the UK Albums Chart . " Pictures on My Wall " and " Rescue " had previously been released as singles . 
 Recorded at Eden Studios in London and at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth , Crocodiles was produced by Bill Drummond and David Balfe , while Ian Broudie had already produced the single " Rescue " . The music and the cover of the album both reflect imagery of darkness and <unk> . The album received favourable reviews from the music press , receiving four out of five stars by both Rolling Stone and Blender magazines . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 Echo & the Bunnymen formed in 1978 and originally consisted of Ian McCulloch ( lead vocals ) , Will Sergeant ( lead guitar ) , Les Pattinson ( bass ) and a drum machine . They released their debut single , " The Pictures on My Wall " in May 1979 on the independent label Zoo Records . The band then signed with WEA subsidiary label Korova and were persuaded to employ a drummer . Pete de Freitas subsequently joined the band and in early 1980 they recorded their second single " Rescue " . The single was recorded at Eden Studios in London and produced by fellow Liverpudlian and ex @-@ member of Big in Japan Ian Broudie . 
 A British tour followed in June 1980 before the band went to Rockfield Studios to record their debut album . Despite talk of the American singer Del Shannon being asked to produce the album , it was produced by the band 's manager Bill Drummond and his business partner and The Teardrop Explodes keyboard player David Balfe . The recording of the album only took three weeks , but Pattinson was still surprised by how boring the recording process was : " There was a lot of hanging about . I didn 't get all the ' drop @-@ ins ' and ' edits ' bit . " 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 The music on Crocodiles is generally dark and moody : In 1980 , the British music magazine NME described McCulloch 's lyrics as a being " scattered with themes of sorrow , horror , and despair , themes that are reinforced by stormy animal / sexual imagery " and American music magazine Creem described Crocodiles as " a moody , mysterious , fascinating record " . In 1981 music journalist David Fricke , writing for Rolling Stone magazine , said , " Instead of dope , McCulloch trips out on his worst fears : isolation , death and emotional bankruptcy . " 
 In his 2005 book Rip It Up and Start Again : Post Punk 1978 – 1984 , British music journalist Simon Reynolds describes the sound of the album as " pared and sparse " . He goes on to describe Pattinson 's " granite basslines " carrying the melody ; Sergeant 's guitar playing as " jagged @-@ quartz " and avoiding " anything resembling a solo , apart from the odd flinty peal of lead playing " ; de Freitas ' drumming as minimal and " surging urgency " ; and McCulloch 's vocals as having " precocious authority " . Reynolds then describes the songs as being rooted in " doubt , anguish , despair " while the " tightness and brightness of their sound transmits contradictory sensations of confidence , vigour and euphoria . " He also describes how the line " Stars are stars and they shine so hard " – from the track " Stars Are Stars " – showed how the band felt no embarrassment in their wish to be famous . In 1989 McCulloch told Reynolds how , as a teenager , he felt there was " a big movie camera in the sky " . McCulloch described the opening line of the track " Going Up " – " Ain 't thou watching my film " – as a terrible line and he went on to say , " It was meant to be tongue in cheek , but that was what spurred me on . " 
 = = Cover = = 
 The photographs used on the cover of the Crocodiles were taken by photographer Brian Griffin . Griffin took a series of pictures of the band in woods near Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire at night and which show themes of introspection , despair and confusion . Describing the picture used on the front cover of the album , music journalist Chris <unk> said , " [ ... ] the Bunnymen are placed in poses of histrionic despair in a near @-@ <unk> gothic woodland that evokes memories of elfin glades and fabled Arthurian legends . " Creem magazine said , " The cover art suggests four boys dazed and confused in a drugged dream , a surreal where @-@ are @-@ we landscape . The Bunnymen 's images are of loneliness , disconnection , a world gone awry . " 
 Originally the band wanted the pictures to include burning stakes , however , given the possible KKK connotations , they settled for moody lighting instead . Despite this , McCulloch was pleased with the cover saying " the cover [ ... ] is better to look at than the Mona Lisa " . Sergeant was less happy and said he " was pissed off that there was a solo picture of [ McCulloch ] on the back cover " . 
 = = Releases = = 
 The album was originally released as an LP in the United Kingdom on 18 July 1980 by Warner Bros. subsidiary label Korova . Two tracks , " Do It Clean " and " Read It in Books " , were included on the cassette but initially omitted from the LP version of the album because the managing director of Warner Bros. , Rob Dickins , thought that they contained obscenities . Dickins realised his error and the tracks were included on the American version of the album , which was released by Sire Records on 17 December 1980 . The two tracks were included with the UK release as a limited edition single . The album was first released on CD in May 1989 by WEA in the UK . It was released on CD in the US by Sire Records the following year . The track @-@ listings of these versions were the same as the original LP releases for each country . 
 Crocodiles and Joy Division 's Closer were released on the same date , July 18 , 1980 . Seemingly forever entwined with Joy Division , the Bunnymen were perhaps more contemporaries of Joy Division in <unk> explorations , versus mere followers of a blueprint for melancholic vocals , sparse guitar , and ominous bass lines . 
 Along with their first five albums , Crocodiles was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003 containing ten bonus tracks on the UK version and eight on the US — these releases were marketed as 25th anniversary editions . The UK version contained the missing tracks " Do It Clean " and " Read It in Books " . The other bonus tracks included " Simple Stuff " which was the B @-@ side to the single " Rescue " ; early versions of " Villiers Terrace " , " Pride " and " Simple Stuff " from the album 's recording sessions ; and the four tracks from the Shine So Hard EP , " Crocodiles " , " Zimbo " , " All That Jazz " and " Over the Wall " . The reissued album was produced by music historian Andy Zax and producer Bill Inglot . 
 Prior to the album 's release , the tracks " Pictures on My Wall " — as " The Pictures on My Wall " — and " Rescue " had already been released as singles . " The Pictures on My Wall " was released on 5 May 1979 and was the band 's first single . Originally recorded and released prior to de Freitas joining the band , the song was re @-@ recorded for the album with him playing drums . The band 's second single , " Rescue " , was released a year later on 5 May 1980 and became the band 's first song to chart when it reached number 62 on the UK Singles Chart . 
 Scottish band Idlewild covered the track " Rescue " on their single " These Wooden Ideas " in June 2000 . In late 2001 American singer @-@ songwriter Kelley Stoltz released the album <unk> , which is a track by track cover version of the original Crocodiles album . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Writing for NME in 1980 Chis <unk> described the album as " being probably the best album this year by a British band " . In his review of the album for Smash Hits , Ian Cranna said that the album was " proof positive that there 's just no substitute for a good song delivered with power and emotion " . Cranna added , " [ The Band ] deliver attractive melodies with dark and moody ( but not obscure ) personal lyrics , all turned into compulsive listening by a driving beat , ringing guitars and a hauntingly emotional voice . " Reviewing the album in 1981 for Rolling Stone magazine , David Fricke awarded it four out of five stars and said when describing McCulloch 's vocals , " [ He ] specializes in a sort of apocalyptic brooding , combining Jim Morrison @-@ style psychosexual yells , a flair for David Bowie @-@ like vocal inflections and the nihilistic bark of his punk peers into a disturbing portrait of the singer as a young neurotic " . He went on to say , " Behind him , gripping music swells into Doors @-@ style dirges ( ' Pictures on My Wall ' ) , PiL @-@ like guitar dynamics ( ' Monkeys ' ) , <unk> evocative pop ( ' Rescue ' ) and Yardbirds @-@ cum @-@ Elevators ravers jacked up in the New Wave manner ( ' Do It Clean , ' ' Crocodiles ' ) " . Reviewing the 2003 remastered version for American music magazine Blender 's website , reviewer Andrew Harrison also gave the album four out of five stars and said , " [ ... ] the Bunnymen were a pure nihilistic thrill , with Will Sergeant 's desperate , mantra @-@ like guitar summoning up a primal night of blinking hallucinations . " 
 Following its release , Crocodiles reached a peak of number 17 on the UK Albums Chart in July 1980 . The album has since sold over 100 @,@ 000 copies and the band was awarded with a gold disc for the album on 5 December 1984 by the British Phonographic Industry . In 1993 , the NME listed Crocodiles at number 28 in its list of the 50 greatest albums of the 1980s . In 2006 , Uncut magazine also listed the album at number 69 on its list of the 100 greatest debut albums .

 = Mona Simpson ( The Simpsons ) = 
 Mona J. Simpson is a recurring fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons . She has been voiced by several actresses , including Maggie Roswell , Tress MacNeille , Pamela Hayden , and most prominently , Glenn Close . Glenn Close 's performances as Mona have been well received by critics and she was named one of the top 25 guest stars on the show by IGN . 
 Mona was the estranged wife of Abe Simpson and the mother of Homer Simpson . In the episode " Mother Simpson " where she was introduced , it was established that Homer believed that his mother was dead , a lie his father Abe told him when in reality she was on the run from the law after she sabotaged Mr Burns ' germ warfare laboratory . Mona first appeared in the second season in a flashback in " Oh Brother , Where Art Thou ? " . She returned in the seventh season for her first main appearance in " Mother Simpson " and also had a large role in " My Mother the Carjacker " . The character appeared again in Season 19 's " Mona Leaves @-@ a " , but died during the episode . An Inception @-@ inspired dream version of her appears in Season 23 's " How I Wet Your Mother " . In the episode " Let 's Go Fly a Coot " , she is revealed to have met Abe when she was a waitress in a cantina bar and he broke the sound barrier to impress her . 
 The character is named after writer Richard Appel 's ex @-@ wife , the American author Mona Simpson . The inspiration for the character is Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Many of the details of Mona 's life are unknown , but various pieces of her story have been revealed . Mona was first mentioned in season one and made two brief flashback appearances , but her first major appearance was in " Mother Simpson " . In the episode , it is revealed that in the 1960s , Mona was a homemaker who lived with her husband Abraham Simpson and Homer , who at the time was a child . She became caught up in the hippie movement after her beliefs were ignited by seeing Joe Namath 's long hair during Super Bowl III . 
 Mona soon after became a political activist and , at one event , Mona and a group of other activists protesting germ research entered Montgomery Burns 's laboratory and destroyed all the biological warfare experiments . As the gang escaped , she stayed behind to help a fallen Burns , who in turn , swore to have her thrown in jail for the rest of her life . Since that night , Mona was forced to leave her family . Abe lied and said Mona had died while Homer was at the movies , in order to spare him of the trauma that his mother was a wanted criminal . For 27 years , Homer presumed that his mother was dead . He was accidentally reunited with Mona in " Mother Simpson " after he faked his own death to get a day off from work and Mona visited his supposed grave site . Overjoyed at their reunion , he brings Mona home to meet his family . At first , Mona does not reveal her whereabouts and spends time catching up with her family , but is forced to reveal her past . She later travels to the post office with Homer , where Mr. Burns recognizes her face and tracks her down with FBI assistance . However , a tip @-@ off to Homer from Chief Wiggum allows Mona to escape . Wiggum is grateful to Mona because his asthma was cured by the " antibiotic bomb " her group detonated during their lab infiltration , thereby allowing him to join the police force . Forced to go on the run again , Mona tells Homer she loves him and escapes to the underground . 
 In " D 'oh @-@ in in the Wind " , it is revealed that at some point , Mona spent time at a commune with two hippies , Seth and Munchie , after life with Abraham became unbearable . It is also strongly implied that she was unfaithful to Abraham . In the episode " Homer 's Paternity Coot " , a long lost letter reveals that Mona had an affair with life guard Mason Fairbanks , leading Homer to falsely believe that he might in fact be his real father . 
 In " My Mother the Carjacker " , Homer discovers a secret message left for him in a newspaper that tells him to go to a location . There Homer finds Mona , who explains she had to return after she saw a macaroni pencil holder Homer made for her when he was five .

 Mona Simpson is first mentioned in season one 's " There 's No Disgrace Like Home " , where Homer recalls his mother telling him that he 's a " big disappointment " . She later made two brief flashback appearances , the first being season two 's " Oh Brother , Where Art Thou ? " and the second being season six 's " Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy " , and in both cases she was voiced by Maggie Roswell . 
 Mona 's first major appearance was in the seventh season episode " Mother Simpson " . The episode was pitched by Richard Appel , who had been desperately trying to think of a story idea and decided to do something about Homer 's mother . 
 Many of the writers were surprised that an episode about Homer 's mother had not previously been produced . The writers used the episode as an opportunity to solve several puzzles about the show , such as where Lisa 's intelligence came from . 
 The character is named after Richard Appel 's wife , who is the novelist Mona Simpson . The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground , although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description . Her crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of , as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns . 
 Mona Simpson was drawn in a way so that she has a little bit of Homer in her face , such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose . There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman , but still be " Simpson @-@ esque " . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 Glenn Close was convinced to voice the character in " Mother Simpson " partially because of James L. Brooks . She was directed in her first performance by Josh Weinstein . When Mona gets in the van , her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close could not say " d 'oh ! " properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden . 
 Glenn Close recorded original material for two other episodes : season 15 's " My Mother the Carjacker " and season 19 's " Mona Leaves @-@ a " . A deleted scene featuring Mona from " Mother Simpson " appears in season seven 's " The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular " . The character also has a speaking appearance in season ten 's " D 'oh @-@ in in the Wind " , this time voiced by Tress MacNeille . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Glenn Close has been well @-@ received as the voice of Mona . IGN.com ranked Close as the 25th best guest star in the show 's history for her first two performances as Mona . In 2007 , Entertainment Weekly called Close one of " fourteen guest stars whose standout performances on TV make us wish they 'd turn up in a Simpsons Movie 2 " . In 2008 , Entertainment Weekly also named Close one of the 16 best Simpsons guest stars . The Phoenix.com placed Close in the second position on their list of the best 20 Simpsons guest stars . Star News Online listed Close as one of the four hundred reasons why they love The Simpsons . Close appeared on AOL 's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars . Robert Canning of IGN wrote that Close " gave us the sweet voice of Mona Simpson . She 's a perfect fit , able to convey a loving , motherly tone , while still convincing the audience she 's a headstrong hippie activist . " 
 " Mother Simpson " is one of Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein 's favorite episodes as they feel it is a perfect combination of real emotion , good jokes and an interesting story and they have expressed regret about not submitting it for the Emmy Award in the Outstanding Animated Program ( For Programming less than One Hour ) category . " My Mother the Carjacker " received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination in 2004 in the animation category . " Mona Leaves @-@ a " received mixed reviews from critics . Robert Canning described it as " clunky and forced and wasn 't all that funny " but still gave it a 7 / 10 . Richard Keller called it a decent episode , but despised Mona 's brief appearance . 
 = Ontario Highway 55 = 
 King 's Highway 55 , commonly referred to as Highway 55 and historically as the Niagara Stone Road and Black Swamp Road , was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario , which connected the Queen Elizabeth Way ( QEW ) with Niagara @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Lake , following Niagara Stone Road . The route divided a swath of wineries at the foot of the Niagara Escarpment , passing at an oblique angle to the concession road grid . 
 A former Highway 55 designation connected Highway 6 with Highway 53 , passing through the Mountain district of Hamilton . The more recent designation was applied in 1970 , following the establishment of the Regional Municipality of Niagara . On April 1 , 1997 , Highway 55 was transferred to Niagara and designated as Niagara Regional Road 55 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 55 began at an intersection with the old Iroquois Trail , now known as Queenston Street to the west and York Road to the east . This road was part of Highway 8 until 1970 , when it was transferred to Niagara Region and redesignated Niagara Regional Road 81 . The roadway that carried Highway 55 continued south of this intersection as Taylor Road ( Niagara Regional Road 70 ) . Continuing north , the highway passed beneath the QEW , which ascends over the Welland Canal on the Garden City Skyway . The highway entered Homer , then curved northeast and entered farmland . From here to its northern terminus , the highway was completely straight . It passed south of the St. Catharines / Niagara District Airport and later intersected Niagara Regional Road 106 . 
 Highway 55 passed through the small town of Virgil , which is centred on the Four Mile Creek . It intersected Four Mile Creek Road ( Niagara Regional Road 100 ) in the centre of the town , then entered back into an agricultural area . Shortly thereafter , the highway entered the urban area of Niagara @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Lake , where it ended at Mary Street ( Niagara Regional Road 87 ) . 
 Several wineries are established along the former route of Highway 55 , most notably the Jackson @-@ Triggs Estate .

 A former Highway 55 designation connected Highway 6 and the QEW with Highway 53 , passing through the Mountain district of Hamilton ; this route was decommissioned in 1961 . The more recent designation was applied in late 1970 , following the establishment of Niagara Region . 
 During the initial settlement period of the Niagara area , following the American Revolutionary War , new wagon routes were built over native footpaths . Grimsby and Newark ( now Niagara @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Lake ) quickly became established settlements , but travel was cumbersome between them . Pioneers were forced to travel south along the Niagara Road to Queenston , where they turned west and followed the Iroquois Road . To remedy the situation , locals gathered in 1798 and constructed the Black Swamp Road to connect Newark with the Iroquois Road near its crossing of Ten Mile Creek ( now the location of the Welland Canal ) . The route , often subject to flooding from the waterlogged soil which it travelled over , was gradually improved , especially during the 1830s . In the late 1840s the Niagara and Ten Mile Creek Plank Road Company planked the length of the road . During the latter half of the 1800s , the road was macadamized , and gradually came to be known as the Niagara Stone Road as the surrounding swampland was drained and farmed . 
 The original incarnation of Highway 55 travelled through Hamilton . It was established in 1937 , following Upper Gage Avenue north from <unk> Road ( itself designated Highway 53 that same year ) to Crockett Avenue and the Sherman Access . It turned west and followed the access down the Niagara Escarpment , ending at Highway 6 ( John Street ) . The route of this highway changed several times through the late 1950s as the Burlington Skyway was constructed . By 1959 , a route down the new Kenilworth Access , north along Kenilworth Avenue and along what is now Burlington Street to the QEW was designated as Highway 55 ; both routes existed simultaneously between 1957 and 1958 . By 1961 , this route had been decommissioned . 
 The recent incarnation of Highway 55 was established following the release of the Niagara Peninsula Planning Study in 1964 , which recommended that the province take jurisdiction of the Niagara Stone Road ( then designated Lincoln County Road 3 ) . It was subsequently assumed on November 5 , 1970 , the same year the Regional Municipality of Niagara was formed . The route followed the entire length of the Niagara Stone Road from Homer to Niagara @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Lake and remained unchanged over its 27 years of existence . Highway 55 was transferred to the Regional Municipality of Niagara on April 1 , 1997 , as part of the first round of mass downloading . It is now designated as Niagara Regional Road 55 . The majority of the former route is named the Niagara Stone Road ; within Niagara @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Lake it is named Mississauga Street .

 = Battle of Marash = 
 The Battle of Marash ( Turkish : <unk> <unk> ) was a battle that took place in the early winter of 1920 between the French forces occupying the city of <unk> in the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish National Forces linked to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk . It was the first major battle of the Turkish War of Independence , and the three @-@ week @-@ long engagement in the city ultimately forced the French to abandon and retreat from Marash and resulted in a Turkish massacre of Armenian refugees who had just been repatriated to the city following the Armenian Genocide . The controversial retreat , along with the massacre that took place under French watch , was subsequently dubbed the " Marash Affair . " 
 = = Background = = 
 After the surrender of the Ottoman Empire to the Allies in October 1918 , the city of Marash had come under the joint @-@ occupation of the British and French armies ( the latter largely composed of Armenians from the French Armenian Legion ) . In February 1919 , Field Marshal Edmund Allenby appointed a number of French officers to oversee the administration of the region of Cilicia and the repatriation of tens of thousands of Armenians who had been deported during the war in the course of the Genocide . Within a few months , approximately 150 @,@ 000 Armenians had been repatriated , including 20 @,@ 000 natives from Marash . 
 In the months following the end of the war , Cilicia had also become a source of dispute between the British and French , who both aspired to establish influence in the region . The British government , however , was under strong domestic pressure to withdraw and demobilize its forces in the Middle East and on 15 September 1919 , Prime Minister David Lloyd George begrudgingly accepted a proposal by Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau to have the French formally assume control of Cilicia . The transfer of command took place on 4 November , but Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch 's promise to reinforce the existing forces in the area with at least 32 infantry battalions , 20 cavalry squadrons and 14 artillery batteries went unfulfilled . The French units were thus deprived of armored cars and air support and lacked automatic weapons , heavy artillery and even wireless transmitters and carrier pigeons . 
 = = Turkish Nationalist movements = = 
 The Anglo @-@ French rivalry had led to the coalescence and strengthening of the Turkish National Movement under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Pasha . Kemal had denounced the Allied occupation of Cilicia in November 1919 and the forces loyal to him were tenaciously preparing to launch a major insurrection against the thinly spread French units garrisoned in Marash , <unk> and Urfa . Experienced officers , including the Kurdish captain Ali Kılıç , were sent by Mustafa Kemal to organize the tribal units and <unk> ( irregular fighters ) bands in the region . The Turkish forces in Marash numbered 2 @,@ 500 . Some of them were armed with old hunting rifles and others with melee weapons . Before the battle , they obtained 850 rifles , 2 machine guns , 2 cannons ( not used during the fighting ) , from the gendarmerie building in Marash . 
 Those without firearms would arm themselves with rifles acquired from killed French soldiers . By January 1920 , French supply convoys and communication lines were regularly coming under attack by the partisans and those Armenians who had been repatriated were being harassed and pressured to leave their homes once more . The French attempted to mollify the minority Muslim elements ( Circassians , Alevis , Kurds ) in Marash by creating gendarmerie units but this only emboldened the Turkish Nationalists to hoist the Turkish flag over Marash 's abandoned citadel and to intimidate those Muslims who cooperated with the French . The French troops in Marash included many Algerians , and also Armenians who had been recently enlisted , and it was stated that the latter had supposedly " annoyed the local population , by their arrogant attitude as they strolled on the streets in their French uniforms . " 
 Seeing all this , Captain Pierre @-@ Jean Daniel André , the head of the Marash detachment , requested additional reinforcements but , due to the indecisiveness of his superior , Lt. Colonel Jean <unk> @-@ Sainte @-@ Marie , he was ordered to go to Adana to apprise the division commander , Brigadier General Julien Dufieux , of the situation . Dufieux agreed to send extra men under the command of General Quérette to Marash but by 17 January , when the reinforcements arrived , the French had already lost the initiative : supply convoys in Bel <unk> and El @-@ <unk> had come under attack and a relief column led by battalion commander Major <unk> had been ambushed . On 21 January , General Quérette summoned the Muslim notables of Marash to his headquarters located at a barracks in the north of the city and presented them with evidence pointing to their complicity in the attacks and demanded that they put an end to the hostilities . As the leaders departed , Turkish police chief Arslan <unk> drew out his pistol and fired five rounds into the air , signaling the beginning of the uprising . 
 = = Active stage = = 
 The first French units to come under attack were those officers accompanying the local gendarmerie or standing guard . The contingents of the French garrison at Marash , numbering only 2 @,@ 000 men , were separated from one another in the city @-@ wide siege . Direct communications did not exist between Marash and division headquarters and General Dufieux was only informed of the insurrection on 31 January , after several Armenians from the French Armenian Legion managed to disguise themselves as Muslims and cross the battle lines . He immediately appointed Lieutenant Colonel Robert Normand to lead a relief expedition , composed of three infantry battalions and half a squadron of cavalry , to Marash , and dispatched aerial recon flights , giving hope to the besieged French , Armenians and American relief workers who were assisting the local population . 
 On 7 February , Normand 's unit fought its way into the city and began to bombard the Turkish positions with heavy artillery . The following day , he relieved <unk> 's column , which had held its position for two weeks , and broke through to reach General Quérette 's headquarters . To Quérette 's astonishment , Normand told that he had come with orders from General Dufieux to begin the full evacuation of the French garrison of Marash , followed by the Christian and loyal Muslim population . Quérette was reluctant to carry out such a command but Normand claimed that no more reinforcements or supplies would be sent . With this in mind Quérette agreed to the evacuation . The order to evacuate ironically came at precisely the same moment that the Turkish Nationalists were seeking a ceasefire : no sooner had General Quérette begun negotiations with the Turkish representative , Dr. Mustafa , when he was told by Normand to prepare to evacuate . By 3 : 00 in the morning of 11 February , Quérette had destroyed the remaining ammunition dumps and was preparing to slip out under the cover of darkness , in order to prevent the terrified Armenian population from hindering his troops ' withdrawal . They were , however , unable to do so and 4 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 Armenians managed to flee with the French troops in a three @-@ day , 75 @-@ mile ( 121 km ) long march to <unk> . Subsequently called the " Marash Affair , " many of the Armenian refugees died from exhaustion and from the bitter cold , such that there were only 1 @,@ 500 of their number when they reached <unk> on 13 February . 
 The French casualties of the battle included 160 killed , 280 wounded , 170 missing and 300 severely frostbitten . 
 = = Massacre of Armenians = = 
 The three @-@ week siege of Marash was also accompanied by the wholesale massacre of the Armenian repatriates . Roving Turkish bands threw kerosene @-@ doused rags on Armenian homes and laid a constant barrage upon the American relief hospital . The Armenians themselves , as in previous times of trouble , sought refuge in their churches and schools . Women and children found momentary shelter in Marash 's six Armenian Apostolic , three Armenian Evangelical churches and in the city 's sole Catholic cathedral . The Armenian legionnaires attempted to put up a defense but were ultimately overwhelmed . All the churches and eventually the entire Armenian districts were put to flames . The plight of the Armenians was only exacerbated when the French decided to pull out on 10 February . When the 2 @,@ 000 Armenians who had taken shelter in the Catholic cathedral attempted to follow the retreat , they were cut down by Turkish rifle and machine gun fire . 
 Early reports put the number of Armenian dead at no less than 16 @,@ 000 , although this was later revised down to 5 @,@ 000 – 12 @,@ 000 , which were considered far more likely figures . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Though news of the siege of the French army and the massacre of the Armenians reached Allied and American representatives in Europe , the French High Command did not publicly indicate that anything serious had taken place . Internally , however , they were astonished by this move launched by the Turkish Nationalists . The battle and the massacre were discussed fervently in the European and American press , as well as the British Parliament . Colonel Normand 's role in ordering the evacuation , in particular , stirred controversy as members of General Dufieux 's staff maintained that no evacuation order had ever been given . Dufieux , however , was inexplicably told by senior commander and General of the Army of the Levant Henri Gouraud that he should let the matter drop . French Colonel Édouard <unk> , the chief administrator of the occupation zone , reflected on the decision in his memoirs : 
 The decision for the retreat remains a mystery . It was not made in Beirut , nor in Adana , but at Marash . There seems to be no doubt that the order to leave would not have been given if a wireless outfit had been available in Marash permitting unbroken communication with Adana . 
 A few years later , he stated frankly , " Colonel Normand did not bring an order for the evacuation ; he gave it [ emphasis in the original ] . " In his own analysis of the conflict , the American relief worker Stanley E. Kerr attributes the withdrawal inter alia to the untenable position the French military itself had assumed , its failure to provide adequate supplies to its men , and its inability to carry out intelligence work . 
 In Constantinople , Allied military representatives pushed to threaten the Ottoman government for the affair , while the French simultaneously explored the possibility of reaching a modus vivendi with Kemal . The Allied Supreme Council , which at the time was working out the details to a peace treaty that it would present to the Ottoman government , deliberated on how best to respond . Some of the delegates present , including Prime Minister David Lloyd @-@ George , insisted that strong pressure should be brought to bear against the Ottoman government to prevent new atrocities , but the other diplomats were skeptical of the idea . The officials also agreed that the Ottoman government should dismiss Kemal from office , although they admitted that such a move was impractical , since the Ottoman government held no control over Kemal , who was leading a counter Turkish government in Anatolia . A decision was finally reached on 10 March . British , French and Italian leaders agreed to authorize the formal occupation of Constantinople , which was carried out by the forces under General George F. Milne 's command on the morning of 16 March . 
 On 7 April 1925 , Marash became one of two cities in Turkey to receive a Turkish Medal of Independence ( the other city being <unk> ) .

 The D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company is a professional light opera company that staged Gilbert and Sullivan 's Savoy operas nearly year @-@ round in the UK and sometimes toured in Europe , North America and elsewhere , from the 1870s until 1982 . The company was revived for short seasons and tours from 1988 to 2003 , and with Scottish Opera it later co @-@ produced two productions . 
 In 1875 , Richard D 'Oyly Carte asked the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan to collaborate on a short comic opera to round out an evening 's entertainment . When that work , Trial by Jury , became a success , Carte put together a syndicate to produce a full @-@ length Gilbert and Sullivan work , The Sorcerer ( 1877 ) , followed by H.M.S. Pinafore ( 1878 ) . After Pinafore became an international sensation , Carte jettisoned his difficult investors and formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan that became the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company . The company produced the succeeding ten Gilbert and Sullivan operas and many other operas and companion pieces at the Savoy Theatre in London , which Carte built in 1881 for that purpose . The company also mounted tours in Britain , New York and elsewhere , usually running several companies simultaneously . Carte 's able assistant , Helen Lenoir , became his wife in 1888 and , after his death in 1901 , she ran the company until her own death in 1913 . By this time , it had become a year @-@ round Gilbert and Sullivan touring repertory company . 
 Carte 's son Rupert inherited the company . Beginning in 1919 , he mounted new seasons in London with new set and costume designs , while continuing the year @-@ round tours in Britain and abroad . With the help of the director J. M. Gordon and the conductor Isidore Godfrey , Carte ran the company for 35 years . He redesigned the Savoy Theatre in 1928 and sponsored a series of recordings over the years that helped to keep the operas popular . After Rupert 's death in 1948 , his daughter Bridget D 'Oyly Carte inherited the company and hired Frederic Lloyd as general manager . The company continued to tour for 35 weeks each year , issue new recordings and play London seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan . In 1961 , the last copyright on the Gilbert and Sullivan operas expired , and Bridget set up and endowed a charitable trust that presented the operas until mounting costs and a lack of public funding forced the closure of the company in 1982 . It re @-@ formed in 1988 with a legacy left by Bridget D 'Oyly Carte , played short tours and London seasons , and issued some popular recordings . Denied significant funding from the English Arts Council , it suspended productions in 2003 . With Scottish Opera , it co @-@ produced The Pirates of Penzance 2013 and The Mikado in 2016 . 
 Some of the company 's performers , over the decades , became stars of their day and often moved on to careers in musical theatre or grand opera . The company licensed the operas for performance in Australasia and to numerous amateur troupes in Britain and elsewhere , providing orchestra parts and prompt books for hire . The company kept the Savoy operas in the public eye for over a century and left an enduring legacy of production styles and stage business that continue to be emulated in new productions . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Beginnings = = = 
 By 1874 , Richard D 'Oyly Carte , a musician and ambitious young impresario , had begun producing operettas in London . He announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for one of his productions that year : " It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light opera . " The Observer reported , " Mr D 'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager , but a trained musician , and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe , and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order , such as a musician might produce with satisfaction " . He wanted to establish a body of tasteful English comic opera that would appeal to families , in contrast to the bawdy burlesques and adaptations of French operettas and opera <unk> that dominated the London musical stage at that time . 
 In early 1875 , Carte was managing London 's Royalty Theatre . Needing a short piece to round out an evening 's entertainment featuring the popular Offenbach operetta La Périchole he brought W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan together . On tour in 1871 , Carte had conducted Arthur Sullivan 's one @-@ act comic opera Cox and Box , which received an 1874 London revival . In 1873 , W. S. Gilbert had offered a libretto to Carte about an English courtroom , but at the time Carte knew of no composer available to set it to music . Carte remembered Gilbert 's libretto and suggested to Gilbert that Sullivan write the music for a one @-@ act comic opera , Trial by Jury , which was quickly composed and added to the Royalty 's bill in March 1875 . The witty and " very English " little piece proved even more popular than La Périchole and became the first great success of Carte 's scheme to found his school of English comic opera , playing for 300 performances from 1875 to 1877 , as well as touring and enjoying many revivals . 
 At the Theatre Royal , in Dublin , Ireland in September 1875 , while there managing the first tour of Trial by Jury , Carte met a young Scottish actress , Helen Lenoir . She became fascinated by his vision for establishing a company to promote English comic opera and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary . Lenoir was well @-@ educated , and her grasp of detail and diplomacy , as well as her organisational ability and business acumen , surpassed even Carte 's . She became intensely involved in all of his business affairs and soon managed many of the company 's responsibilities , especially concerning touring . She later travelled to America numerous times over the years to arrange the details of the company 's New York engagements and American tours . Still , Carte continued to produce continental operetta , touring in the summer of 1876 with a repertoire consisting of three English adaptations of French opera bouffe and two one @-@ act English curtain raisers ( Happy Hampstead and Trial by Jury ) . Carte himself was the musical director of this travelling company , which disbanded after the tour . 
 In 1876 , Carte found four financial backers and formed the Comedy Opera Company in 1876 to produce more works by Gilbert and Sullivan , along with the works of other British lyricist / composer teams . With this theatre company , Carte finally had the financial resources , after many failed attempts , to produce a new full @-@ length Gilbert and Sullivan opera . Carte leased the Opera Comique , a small theatre off The Strand . The first comic opera produced by the Comedy Opera Company was Gilbert and Sullivan 's The Sorcerer , about a tradesmanlike London sorcerer . It opened in November 1877 together with Dora 's Dream , a curtain @-@ raiser with music by Sullivan 's assistant Alfred Cellier and words by Arthur Cecil , a friend of both Gilbert and Sullivan . 
 Instead of writing a piece for production by a theatre proprietor , as was usual in Victorian theatres , Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte produced the show with their own financial support . They were therefore able to select their own cast of performers , rather than being obliged to use the actors already engaged at the theatre . They chose talented actors , most of whom were not well @-@ known stars and did not command high fees , and to whom they could teach a more naturalistic style of performance than was commonly used at the time . Carte 's talent agency provided many of the artists to perform in the new work . They then tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers . Some of the cast members , including principal comedian George Grossmith , Richard Temple and Rutland Barrington , stayed with the company for almost 15 years . Two other longstanding members of the company were Rosina Brandram , who started in D 'Oyly Carte touring companies with The Sorcerer , and Jessie Bond who joined the group for Pinafore at the Opera Comique in 1878 . As Grossmith wrote in 1888 , " We are all a very happy family . " 
 Knowing that Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of broadening the audience for British light opera by increasing its quality and respectability , Carte gave Gilbert wider authority as a director than was customary among Victorian producers , and Gilbert tightly controlled all aspects of production , including staging , design and movement . Gilbert hired the Gaiety Theatre 's ballet @-@ master John D 'Auban to choreograph most of the Savoy operas . The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience ; as the critic Herman Klein wrote : " we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [ the Gilbertian quips and absurdities ] were said and done . For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird , eccentric , yet intensely human beings .... [ They ] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight . " The Sorcerer ran for 178 performances , a healthy run at the time , making a profit , and Carte sent out a touring company in March 1878 . Sheet music from the show sold well , and street musicians played the melodies . The success of The Sorcerer showed Carte , Gilbert and Sullivan that there was a future in family @-@ friendly English comic opera . 
 = = = Pinafore to Patience = = = 
 The next Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration , H.M.S. Pinafore , opened in May 1878 . The opera 's initial slow business was generally ascribed to a heat wave that made the stuffy Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable . Carte 's partners in the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the show and posted closing notices . After Carte made promotional efforts and Sullivan included some of the Pinafore music in several promenade concerts that he conducted at Covent Garden , Pinafore became a hit . The Opera Comique was required to close at Christmas 1878 for repairs to drainage and sewage under the Public Health Act of 1875 . Carte used the enforced closure of the theatre to invoke a contract clause reverting the rights of Pinafore and Sorcerer to Gilbert and Sullivan after the initial run of H.M.S. Pinafore . Carte then took a six @-@ month personal lease on the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879 . Carte persuaded Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879 , a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage . The three each put up £ 1 @,@ 000 and formed a new partnership under the name " Mr Richard D 'Oyly Carte 's Opera Company " . Under the partnership agreement , once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted , each of the three men was entitled to one third of the profits . 
 On 31 July 1879 , the last day of their agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan , the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the set by force during a performance , causing a celebrated fracas . Carte 's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery . The Comedy Opera Company opened a rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore in London , but it was not as popular as the D 'Oyly Carte production , and soon closed . Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte , Gilbert and Sullivan . From 1 August 1879 , the company , later called the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company , became the sole authorised producer of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan . 
 Pinafore became so successful that the piano score sold 10 @,@ 000 copies , and Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces . The opera ran for 571 performances in London , the second longest run in musical theatre history up to that time . Over 150 unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone , but because American law then offered no copyright protection to foreigners , Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte had no way to prevent them . To try to make some money from the popularity of their opera in America , Carte travelled to New York with Gilbert , Sullivan and the company to present an " authentic " production of Pinafore on Broadway , beginning in December 1879 , also mounting American tours . Beginning with Pinafore , Carte licensed the J. C. Williamson company to produce the works in Australia and New Zealand . 
 In an effort to head off unauthorised American productions of their next opera , The Pirates of Penzance , Carte and his partners opened it in New York on 31 December 1879 , prior to its 1880 London premiere . Pirates was the only Gilbert and Sullivan opera to have its official premiere in America . Carte and his partners hoped to forestall further " piracy " by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto . They did succeed in keeping for themselves the direct profits of the venture , but they tried without success for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas . Pirates was an immediate hit in New York , and later London , becoming one of the most popular Gilbert and Sullivan operas . To secure the British copyright , there was a perfunctory performance the afternoon before the New York premiere , at the Royal Bijou Theatre , Paignton , Devon , organised by Helen Lenoir . 
 The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera , Patience , opened at the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success , becoming the second longest @-@ running piece in the series and enjoying numerous foreign productions . Patience satirised the self @-@ indulgent Aesthetic movement of the 1870s and ' 80s in England , part of the 19th @-@ century European movement that emphasised aesthetic values over moral or social themes in literature , fine art , the decorative arts , and interior design . From the beginning , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company established strict rules for its actors and actresses , to avoid any hint of scandal such as performers were accused of in other companies . As Jessie Bond described in her autobiography : 
 No lingering about was allowed , no gossiping with the other actors ; the women ’ s dressing @-@ rooms were on one side of the stage , the men 's on the other , and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases – sheep rigorously separated from the goats ! Once , when my mother came to see me in London , expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury , and far down the road to perdition , I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses , <unk> in their austerity . ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety ; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience . Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it , and watched over us young women like a dragon . 
 With profits from the success of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency ( his talent roster included Adelina Patti , Clara Schumann , Jacques Offenbach , Oscar Wilde and Charles Gounod ) , Carte bought property along the Strand with frontage onto the Thames Embankment , where he built the Savoy Theatre in 1881 . He chose the name in honour of the Savoy Palace . The Savoy Theatre was a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art facility , setting a new standard for technology , comfort and decor . It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights and seated nearly 1 @,@ 300 people ( compared to the Opera Comique 's 862 ) . 
 Patience was the first production at the new theatre , transferring there on 10 October 1881 . The first generator proved too small to power the whole building , and though the entire front @-@ of @-@ house was electrically lit , the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881 . At that performance , Carte stepped on stage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology . The Times concluded that the theatre " is admirably adapted for its purpose , its acoustic qualities are excellent , and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with . " Carte and his manager , George Edwardes ( later famous as manager of the Gaiety Theatre ) , introduced several innovations at the theatre , including numbered seating , free programme booklets , the " queue " system for the pit and gallery ( an American idea ) and a policy of no tipping for cloakroom or other services . Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales . The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan 's comic operas were premièred at the Savoy . 
 During the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written , the company also produced operas by other composer – librettist teams , either as curtain @-@ raisers to the Gilbert and Sullivan pieces , or as touring productions , as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between Savoy operas , and Carte also toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas extensively . For example , a souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of Patience in London and its 100th performance in New York shows that , aside from these two productions of Patience , Carte was simultaneously producing two companies touring with Patience , two companies touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas , a company touring with Olivette ( co @-@ produced with Charles Wyndham ) a company touring Claude Duval in America , a production of Youth running at a New York theatre , a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes ( a war correspondent ) and productions of Patience , Pirates , Claude Duval and Billee Taylor in association with J. C. Williamson in Australia , among other things . 
 In the 1880s , Carte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights , increasing their popularity and the sales of scores and libretti , as well as the rental of band parts . This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general . Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that , prior to the creation of the Savoy operas , amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals . After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas , professionals recognised that the amateur societies " support the culture of music and the drama . They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage , and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present @-@ day favourites . " Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to " the popularity of , and infectious craze for performing , the Gilbert and Sullivan operas " . The National Operatic and Dramatic Association was founded in 1899 . It reported , in 1914 , that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year . Carte insisted that amateur companies follow the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company staging , using its prompt books . Even after the copyrights expired at the end of 1961 , the company continued to , and still does , rent out band parts to companies around the world . 
 = = = Iolanthe to The Gondoliers = = = 
 After Patience , the company produced Iolanthe , which opened in 1882 . During its run , in February 1883 , Carte signed a five @-@ year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan , obligating them to create new operas for the company upon six months ' notice . Sullivan had not intended immediately to write a new work with Gilbert , but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long @-@ term contract necessary for his security . But he soon felt trapped . Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments , regarding the agreement : " Effectively , it made [ Gilbert and Sullivan ] Carte 's employees – a situation which created its own resentments . " The partnership 's next opera , Princess Ida , opened in January 1884 . Carte soon saw that Ida was running weakly at the box office and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners for a new opera to be written . Almost from the beginning of the partnership , the musical establishment put pressure on Sullivan to abandon comic opera , and he soon regretted having signed the five @-@ year contract . In March 1884 , Sullivan told Carte that " it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself . " 
 During this conflict and others during the 1880s , Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently had to smooth over the partners ' differences with a mixture of friendship and business acumen . Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions . Nevertheless , they coaxed eight comic operas out of Gilbert and Sullivan in the 1880s . When Princess Ida closed after a comparatively short run of nine months , for the first time in the partnership 's history , the next opera was not ready . To make matters worse , Gilbert suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected , and he now rejected the " lozenge plot " again . Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884 . 
 The company produced the first revival of The Sorcerer , together with Trial by Jury , and matinees of The Pirates of Penzance played by a cast of children , while waiting for the new work to be completed . This became the partnership 's most successful opera , The Mikado , which opened in March 1885 . The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan . At the same time , it took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic Far East using the " picturesque " scenery and costumes of Japan . The Mikado became the partnership 's longest @-@ running hit , enjoying 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre , the second longest run for any work of musical theatre up to that time , and it was extraordinarily popular in the U.S. and worldwide . It remains the most frequently performed Savoy opera . Beginning with The Mikado , Hawes Craven , the designer of the sets for Henry Irving 's spectacular Shakespeare productions at the Lyceum Theatre , designed all of the D 'Oyly Carte sets until 1893 . 
 The partnership 's next opera was Ruddigore , which opened in January 1887 . It satirised and used elements of Victorian stock melodrama . The piece , though profitable , was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary success of The Mikado . When Ruddigore closed after a run of only nine months , the company mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas for almost a year . After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a " lozenge plot " , Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio @-@ comic plot for The Yeomen of the Guard , which premiered in October 1888 . The opera was a success , running for over a year , with strong New York and touring productions . During the run , in March 1889 , Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera , asking if Gilbert would write a " dramatic work on a larger musical scale " . Gilbert declined , but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted : The two would write a light opera for the Savoy , and at the same time , Sullivan could work on a grand opera ( Ivanhoe ) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera . The new comic opera was The Gondoliers , which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership 's greatest successes . After Carte 's first wife died in 1885 , Carte married Helen Lenoir in 1888 , who was , by this time , nearly as important in managing the company as Carte himself . 
 During these years , the company 's high production values , and the quality of the operas , created a national and international taste for them , and the company mounted touring productions throughout the provinces , in America ( generally managed by Helen ) , Europe and elsewhere . Queen Victoria honoured the company by calling for a Royal Command Performance of The Gondoliers at Windsor Castle in 1891 . George Bernard Shaw , writing in The World in October 1893 , commented , " Those who are old enough to compare the Savoy performances with those of the dark ages , taking into account the pictorial treatment of the fabrics and colours on the stage , the cultivation and intelligence of the choristers , the quality of the orchestra , and the degree of artistic good breeding , so to speak , expected from the principals , best know how great an advance has been made by Mr. D 'Oyly Carte . " 
 = = = The Carpet Quarrel and the end of the partnership = = = 
 On 22 April 1890 , during the run of The Gondoliers , Gilbert discovered that maintenance expenses for the theatre , including a new £ 500 carpet for the front lobby of the theatre , were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte . Gilbert confronted Carte , and Carte refused to reconsider the accounts : Even though the amount of the charge was not great , Gilbert felt it was a moral issue involving Carte 's integrity , and he could not look past it . Gilbert wrote in a letter to Sullivan that " I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen " . Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte " in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial . " Gilbert brought a lawsuit , but Sullivan sided with Carte , who was building the Royal English Opera House , the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan 's forthcoming grand opera . Gilbert won the suit , but the partnership disbanded . 
 Sullivan 's opera , Ivanhoe , had a successful run , but no other operas shared Carte 's new opera house , and so the theatre soon failed . Carte sold the opera house , and it eventually became the Palace Theatre . 
 After The Gondoliers closed in 1891 , Gilbert withdrew the performance rights to his libretti and vowed to write no more operas for the Savoy . The D 'Oyly Carte company turned to new writing teams for the Savoy , first producing The Nautch Girl , by George Dance , Frank Desprez and Edward Solomon , which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891 – 92 . Next was a revival of Solomon and Sydney Grundy 's The Vicar of Bray , which played through the summer of 1892 . Grundy and Sullivan 's Haddon Hall then held the stage until April 1893 . While the company presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy , Carte 's touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America . In 1894 , for example , Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America . 
 Gilbert 's aggressive , though successful , legal action had embittered Sullivan and Carte , but the partnership had been so profitable that the Cartes eventually sought to reunite Gilbert and Sullivan . The reconciliation finally came through the efforts of Tom Chappell , who published the sheet music to the Savoy operas . In 1893 , the company produced the penultimate Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration , Utopia , Limited . While Utopia was being prepared , the company produced Jane Annie , by J. M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle , with music by Ernest Ford . Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle , the show was a flop , closing in July 1893 after only 51 performances . Utopia was the Savoy 's most expensive production to date , but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances , until June 1894 , turning a very modest profit . The company then played first Mirette , composed by André Messager , then The Chieftain , by F. C. Burnand and Sullivan . These ran for 102 and 97 performances , respectively . After The Chieftain closed , the company toured the London suburbs , while Carte leased the Savoy Theatre to the Carl Rosa Opera Company . The theatre was dark during the summer of 1895 , reopening in November for a revival of The Mikado . This was followed by The Grand Duke , in 1896 , which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan 's only financial failure . The Gondoliers turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan 's last big hit , and after The Grand Duke , the two men never collaborated again . 
 In 1894 , Carte had hired his son , Rupert , as an assistant . Rupert assisted Mrs. Carte and W. S. Gilbert with the first revival of The Yeomen of the Guard at the Savoy in May 1897 . Throughout the later 1890s , Carte 's health was declining , and Mrs. Carte assumed more and more of the responsibilities of running the opera company . She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies . The Savoy 's shows during this period received comparatively short runs , including His Majesty ( 1897 ) , The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein ( 1897 ) , The Beauty Stone ( 1898 ) and The Lucky Star ( 1899 ) , as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas . Sullivan 's The Beauty Stone ran for only 50 performances . In 1899 , the Savoy finally had a new success , with Sullivan and Basil Hood 's The Rose of Persia , which ran for 213 performances . Neither Carte nor Sullivan lived to see the production of Sullivan and Hood 's The Emerald Isle ( 1901 ) , for which Edward German completed the score . 
 = = = Early 20th century = = = 
 Carte left his theatre , opera company and hotels to his wife , who assumed full control of the family businesses . Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy operas in Britain and overseas . She leased the Savoy Theatre to William Greet in 1901 and oversaw his management of the company 's revival of Iolanthe and the production of several new comic operas , including The Emerald Isle ( 1901 ) , Merrie England ( 1902 ) and A Princess of Kensington ( with music by Edward German , libretto by Basil Hood ) , which ran for four months in early 1903 and then toured . When A Princess of Kensington closed at the Savoy , Mrs. Carte leased the theatre to other managements until 8 December 1906 . The company 's fortunes declined for a time , and by 1904 there was only a single touring company <unk> its way through the British provinces , when it took a seven @-@ month South African tour . 
 In 1906 – 07 , Mrs. Carte staged a repertory season at the Savoy Theatre , with Gilbert returning to direct . The season , which included Yeomen , The Gondoliers , Patience and Iolanthe , was a sensation and led to another in 1908 – 09 including The Mikado , Pinafore , Iolanthe , Pirates , The Gondoliers and Yeomen . Afterwards , however , Mrs. Carte 's health prevented her from staging more London seasons . She retired and leased the theatre to C. H. Workman , and the company did not perform in London again until 1919 , although it continued to tour throughout Britain . 
 After Gilbert 's death in 1911 , the company continued to produce productions of the operas in repertory until 1982 . In 1911 , Helen Carte hired J. M. Gordon as stage manager . Gordon , who was promoted to stage director in 1922 , had been a member of the company and a stage manager under Gilbert 's direction , and he fiercely preserved the company 's performing traditions in exacting detail for 28 years . Except for Ruddigore , which underwent some cuts and received a new overture , very few changes were made to the text and music of the operas as Gilbert and Sullivan had produced them , and the company stayed true to Gilbert 's period settings . The traditions evolved over time , after Gordon 's death , but many of Gilbert 's directorial concepts survived , both in the stage directions printed in the libretti and as preserved in company prompt books from the era . Original choreography was also maintained . In addition , some of the staging added over the years became traditional and was repeated again and again in successive productions . Many of these traditional stagings are imitated today in productions by both amateur and professional companies . 
 Helen Carte died in 1913 , and Carte 's son Rupert D 'Oyly Carte inherited the company . During World War I , he was away serving in the Royal Navy . According to H. M. Walbrook , " Through the years of the Great War [ the company ] continued to be on tour through the country , drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere . They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period , and by so doing they helped to win the victory . " The company also toured in North America several times , beginning with a Canadian tour in 1927 . 
 Rupert D 'Oyly Carte found the company 's productions increasingly " dowdy " , however , and on his return from the war , he determined to refresh them , bringing in new designers including W. Bridges @-@ Adams for the sets , and , for the costumes , George Sheringham and Hugo Rumbold . He also commissioned new costumes from Percy Anderson who had worked with Gilbert and Richard D 'Oyly Carte on the original productions of the later Savoy operas . Charles Ricketts redesigned sets and costumes for The Mikado ( 1926 ) and The Gondoliers ( 1929 ) . His costumes for The Mikado were retained by all subsequent designers until 1982 . In an interview in The Observer in August 1919 , Carte set out his policy for staging the operas : " They will be played precisely in their original form , without any alteration to the words , or any attempt to bring them up to date . " This uncompromising declaration was modified in a later interview in which he said , " the plays are all being restaged . ... Gilbert 's words will be unaltered , though there will be some freshness in the method of rendering them . Artists must have scope for their individuality , and new singers cannot be tied down to imitate slavishly those who made successes in the old days . " 
 The main company made a triumphant return to London for the 1919 – 20 season at the Prince 's Theatre , playing most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas in repertory and showing off the new sets and costumes . The success of this season led to additional London seasons in 1919 – 20 , 1921 – 22 , 1924 , and 1926 ; the company toured the rest of the year . Carte 's first London season stimulated renewed interest in the operas , and by 1920 he had established a second , smaller company to tour smaller towns . It was disbanded in 1927 , although the company often ran multiple tours simultaneously . For London seasons , Carte engaged guest conductors , first Geoffrey Toye , then Malcolm Sargent , who examined Sullivan 's manuscript scores and purged the orchestral parts of accretions . So striking was the orchestral sound produced by Sargent that the press thought he had retouched the scores , and Carte had the pleasant duty of correcting their error . In a letter to The Times , he noted that " the details of the orchestration sounded so fresh that some of the critics thought them actually new ... the opera was played last night exactly as written by Sullivan . " Carte also hired Harry Norris , who started with the touring company , then was Toye 's assistant before becoming musical director . 
 In 1917 , the company made the first complete recording of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera , The Mikado , for the Gramophone Company ( later known as His Master 's Voice ) . Rupert D 'Oyly Carte supervised the company 's recordings , including eight more acoustic recordings by 1924 , and a series of complete electrical recordings in the late 1920s and early 1930s . There were additional recordings , in high fidelity , for Decca Records , in the late 1940s and early 1950s and stereo recordings in the late 1950s and early 1960s , all supervised after Rupert 's death by his daughter , Bridget D 'Oyly Carte . 
 = = = The new Savoy Theatre = = = 
 Rupert D 'Oyly Carte also redesigned the Savoy Theatre . On 3 June 1929 the Savoy closed , and it was completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with décor by Basil Ionides . The old house had three tiers ; the new one had two . The seating capacity was increased from 986 to 1 @,@ 158 . The theatre reopened 135 days later on 21 October 1929 , with The Gondoliers , designed by Ricketts and conducted by Sargent . George Sheringham designed new productions that season of H.M.S. Pinafore , The Pirates of Penzance , and Patience ( 1929 , with other designs contributed by Hugo Rumbold ) , and he later designed costumes for Trial by Jury and Iolanthe . 
 The Savoy also hosted London seasons for the company in 1930 – 31 , 1933 , 1941 , 1951 , 1954 , 1961 , 1963 – 64 , and 1975 . London seasons at other theatres , mostly Sadler 's Wells , included summer seasons from 1935 to 1939 , 1942 , 1947 to 1950 , 1953 , 1971 , 1975 , 1977 and 1980 ; and winter seasons in 1956 – 57 , 1958 – 59 , 1960 – 61 , 1963 – 63 , 1965 – 66 , 1967 – 68 , and then every winter between 1969 – 70 and 1981 – 82 . The company continued to tour the British provinces and abroad when it was not in London , and these tours also often included London suburbs . The company 's musical director from 1929 ( having been assistant musical director from 1925 ) was Isidore Godfrey , who retained the position until 1968 and guest conducted the company in 1975 , as part of the centenary season at the Savoy Theatre . Guest conductors during Godfrey 's tenure were Sargent and Boyd Neel . Henry Lytton retired in 1934 after a quarter century as the principal comedian , and the company made a highly successful eight @-@ month North American tour with its new principal comedian , Martyn Green . In 1938 , many company members participated in the Technicolor film of The Mikado produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye . 
 On 3 September 1939 , at the outbreak of World War II , the British government ordered the immediate and indefinite closure of all theatres . Carte cancelled the autumn tour and disbanded the company . Theatres were permitted to reopen from 9 September , but it took some weeks to re @-@ form the company . Some performers , including Martyn Green , were already committed elsewhere , and Grahame Clifford was engaged to play his roles . The company resumed touring , in Edinburgh , on Christmas Day 1939 . The company continued to perform throughout the war , both on tour and in London , but in 1940 German bombing destroyed the sets and costumes for five of its shows : Cox and Box , The Sorcerer , H.M.S. Pinafore , Princess Ida and Ruddigore . The old productions of Pinafore and Cox and Box were recreated shortly after the war , and Ruddigore received a new production , planned by Carte but not seen until after his death . The other two operas took longer to rejoin the company 's repertory . On the other hand , for the first wartime season , Peter Goffin , a protege of Carte 's daughter , Bridget , had designed a new production of The Yeomen of the Guard first seen in January 1940 , and his new Ruddigore debuted in 1948 . A return to the U.S. in 1947 was very successful , and the company resumed frequent visits to America . 
 Rupert died in 1948 , leaving a strong company to his daughter Bridget D 'Oyly Carte . She soon hired Frederic Lloyd as general manager . Bridget and Lloyd also took steps to keep the productions fresh , engaging designers to redesign the costumes and scenery . Peter Goffin , who had redesigned Yeomen ( 1939 ) and Ruddigore ( 1948 ) for the company , created new settings and costumes for Bridget for half a dozen more productions : The Mikado ( 1952 ; settings only , most of the celebrated Charles Ricketts costumes being retained ) , Patience ( 1957 ) , The Gondoliers ( 1958 ) , Trial by Jury ( 1959 ) , H.M.S. Pinafore ( 1961 ; ladies ' costumes ) and Iolanthe ( 1961 ) . A new production of Princess Ida in 1954 was designed by James Wade . Eleanor Evans , however , was an example of one of the company 's stage directors ( from 1949 to 1953 ) who was said to be reluctant to update and freshen stagings . In 1957 , Goffin designed a unit set for the company to facilitate touring , reducing the number of vans required to carry the scenery from twenty to nine . A 1957 review of Yeomen in The Times praised the production and marvelled at " the continued vitality of the Savoy operas " , noting : " The opera remains enchanting ; the singing seems , on the whole , better and more musical than that which one used to hear , say , 30 years since ; and though the acting lacks some of the richly crusted performances of those days , it is perhaps none the worse for that " . In 1949 , the company began a new series of recordings with Decca , featuring Green , who had returned to the company after the war , and continued the series with his successor , Peter Pratt . The company cooperated with the production of the 1953 film The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan , which used some former members of the company in the cast . In 1955 , the company gave a seven @-@ month tour to the U.S. to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its first American productions . In 1959 , the company began the tradition of holding a zany " last night " on the last evening of each London season .

 With the approaching end of the D 'Oyly Carte monopoly on Gilbert and Sullivan performances , when the copyright on Gilbert 's words expired in 1961 ( Sullivan ’ s music had already come out of copyright at the end of 1950 ) , Bridget D 'Oyly Carte contributed the company and all its assets to an independent charitable trust . She endowed the trust with the company 's scenery , costumes , band parts and other assets , together with a cash endowment , and supervised the production of operas on behalf of the trust until economic necessity forced the closure of the company in 1982 . As it turned out , competing professional productions of Gilbert and Sullivan did not harm the company . Beginning in 1960 , the company re @-@ recorded all of the operas with Pratt 's successor , John Reed , and also recorded a number of other Sullivan pieces . It made a cinema film of The Mikado in 1966 , and recorded for television broadcast its productions of Patience ( 1965 ) and H.M.S. Pinafore ( 1973 ) . It also supplied the soundtrack for a cartoon film of Ruddigore ( 1967 ) . During the 1960s , the company gave five North American tours . A new stage director , Michael Heyland , was hired in 1969 , staying until 1978 . 
 In March and April 1975 , after the regular London season at Sadler 's Wells , the company moved to the Savoy Theatre for a fortnight 's centennial performances , beginning on 25 March , the 100th anniversary of the first performance of Trial by Jury . All thirteen surviving Gilbert and Sullivan operas were performed in chronological order . Trial by Jury was given four times , as a curtain raiser to The Sorcerer , Pinafore and Pirates and as an afterpiece following The Grand Duke . Before the first of the four performances of Trial , a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas @-@ Home , called Dramatic Licence , was played by Peter Pratt as Richard D 'Oyly Carte , Kenneth Sandford as Gilbert and John <unk> as Sullivan , in which Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of Trial in 1875 ; afterwards , the prime minister , Harold Wilson , and Bridget D 'Oyly Carte each gave a short speech . A highlight of the season was a new staging of Utopia Limited ( later given again at the Royal Festival Hall ) , its first revival by the company . The Grand Duke was given as a concert performance , with narration by the BBC presenter Richard Baker . Royston Nash , who was at the company 's musical helm from 1971 to 1979 , conducted most of the performances , with Isidore Godfrey ( Pinafore ) and Sir Charles Mackerras ( Pirates and Mikado ) as guest conductors . Princes Philip and Andrew saw The Gondoliers . In the final performance of Trial by Jury , the regular D 'Oyly Carte chorus was augmented by fourteen former stars of the company : Sylvia Cecil , Elsie Griffin , Ivan Menzies , John Dean , Radley Flynn , Elizabeth Nickell @-@ Lean , Ella <unk> , Leonard Osborn , Cynthia Morey , Jeffrey <unk> , Alan Barrett , Mary Sansom , Philip Potter and Gillian Humphreys . 
 In 1977 , during Queen Elizabeth II 's Jubilee Year , the company gave a Royal Command Performance of Pinafore at Windsor Castle . The company visited Denmark in 1970 , Rome in 1974 , and gave its last American tours in 1976 and 1978 . Its last tour , in Australasia , conducted by the company 's new musical director , Fraser Goulding , was a success in 1979 . Throughout the 20th century , until 1982 , the company toured , on average , for 35 weeks per year ( in addition to its 13 @-@ week London seasons ) , fostering a " strong family atmosphere , reinforced by the number of marriages in the company and the fact that so many people stayed with it for so long . " Principal soprano Valerie Masterson married the company 's principal flautist , Andrew March . She explained , " people didn 't have flats or houses ... touring was your life . " Throughout its history , the company maintained strict moral standards , and it was sometimes referred to as the " Savoy boarding school " , enforcing policies regarding behaviour on and off stage , and even a dress code . Soprano Cynthia Morey ascribed the strong affection that artists had for the company to " the unique family atmosphere engendered by the company 's direct descent from its creators , Gilbert , Sullivan ... Richard D 'Oyly Carte , followed by his widow , Helen , his son Rupert , and finally his granddaughter Bridget . " The company also preserved , for over a century , what The Times called a " unique performance style , which may be summarised as a combination of good taste and good fun " . 
 After the 1979 tour , the rising costs of mounting year @-@ round professional light opera without any government support , despite some generous private contributions , caused the company to accrue increasing <unk> in 1980 , the English Arts Council 's Music Panel and Touring Committee recommended that the Arts Council make a grant to the company , but this idea was rejected . The company 's fans made an effort to raise private funds , but these were insufficient to make up the accelerating losses . In 1981 , producer George Walker proposed to film the company performing all of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas but backed out . Bridget D 'Oyly Carte was forced to close the company in 1982 , after a final London season in which John Reed and Valerie Masterson returned as guest artists . It gave its last performance on 27 February 1982 , at the Adelphi Theatre . A three @-@ LP recording of this performance was released , which included songs from all of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas . The company had operated nearly continuously for 107 years since the opening of Trial by Jury in 1875 . Even after it closed , however , the company 's productions continued to influence the productions of other companies . 
 = = Revivals of the company = = 
 Dame Bridget D ’ <unk> Carte died in 1985 , leaving in her will a £ 1 million legacy to enable the company to be revived . The company secured sponsorship from Sir Michael Bishop , who later became chairman of the board of trustees , the Birmingham City Council and BMI British Midland Airways ( of which Bishop is chairman ) . Richard Condon was appointed the revived company 's first general manager , and Bramwell Tovey was its first musical director . In succeeding seasons , the company 's productions of The Mikado and H.M.S. Pinafore were nominated for Olivier Awards . From 1988 to 2003 , the company mounted productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas on tour and in London , and it produced several operettas by Offenbach , Lehár and Strauss . Unlike the original company , which had regularly performed up to a dozen operas each year , 48 weeks a year , the new company generally presented only one or two operas in shorter seasons . In the first season , in 1988 , the operas played were Iolanthe and The Yeomen of the Guard , both starring Gillian Knight . The company made its debut at the Sunderland Empire Theatre on 29 April 1988 , and , after touring , opened in London at the Cambridge Theatre in July . The press notices were good , particularly about the musical aspects of the new company ; opinion was divided about the staging . The Observer thought the productions " miles superior to the later work of the old D 'Oyly Carte ; better designed , better lit ... better played and better sung . " A review in The Guardian praised the musical standards , but added , " Gilbert and Sullivan is as much theatrical as musical entertainment and there remains a lot to be done on the visual side . " 
 The two operas presented in 1989 were The Mikado and The Pirates of Penzance . The new company 's first three productions were broadly traditional in their staging . The Pirates , however , marked a break with traditional presentations , with the setting a giant toy @-@ box and a collapsible toy boat . In 1990 the company presented campier versions of Pinafore and Trial ( including a heavily pregnant Angelina ) that were much criticised by the old company 's fans , who complained that it was a betrayal of the legacy left by Bridget D 'Oyly Carte . The next season departed further from earnest presentations in its production of The Gondoliers , which included a deeply corrugated stage floor , " startling " , " surreal , primary coloured , starkly angled sets " , gimmicky distracting business and generally staging that was considered " way over the top " . It " was unveiled to storms of outraged booing " . Most of the critics shared the public 's disapproval of the production . The Times wrote , " The satiric point disappears in meretricious ado and humourless humour " . Some critics , however , thought that it was time to sweep away " bad and lazy " traditions of the old company , calling the production " riotous , zany and subversive ... with a <unk> or Pythonesque sense of slapstick comedy " , noting that " The girls are pretty and the boys are handsome , and they sing and dance with a youthful freshness " . Also in 1991 , the company accepted an offer from the Alexandra Theatre , Birmingham , to make its base there , although its pattern of spring national tours and summer London seasons was not affected . 
 Another initiative was to stage a foreign operetta for the first time since Richard D 'Oyly Carte 's day , in what would be D 'Oyly Carte 's first co @-@ production . The work chosen was Orpheus in the Underworld , which Opera North presented in 1992 and D 'Oyly Carte toured in 1993 as part of its 35 @-@ week tour celebrating the 150th anniversary of Sullivan 's birth . The innovation was welcomed , receiving an Arts Council Grant , and the company later presented Die Fledermaus ( 1994 ) , La vie parisienne ( 1995 ) and The Count of Luxembourg ( 1997 ) . Of the Savoy operas , the new company never staged The Sorcerer , Patience , Princess Ida , Ruddigore , Utopia and The Grand Duke , stating that they lacked box @-@ office potential . 
 Unlike its predecessor , the new company was not a permanent ensemble with a recognisable style . Some performers appeared in several productions , but each production was cast anew , often with guest stars from British television in leading roles , with varying degrees of success . The chorus and orchestra of the new company were much smaller than those of the old company : the chorus was reduced from 32 ( or more ) to 20 , and the orchestra from 38 generally to 24 . For a 1998 production of Pirates at the Queen 's Theatre , the orchestra was even smaller : The Guardian wrote , " The goings @-@ on in the pit are dispiriting . Budgetary constraints have forced the company to re @-@ write the score for a band of nine instrumentalists . They play well enough , but every one of Sullivan 's parodies loses its clout . " The company received a modest Arts Council grant in 1997 to keep it afloat and turned to private funding from Raymond Gubbay for London seasons beginning in 1998 . Despite the lean forces , the company received generally favourable reviews over the next five years under the management of Ian Martin . Although the new company 's productions met with mixed reviews , some of its recordings have been well received . Many of these recordings also restore music that had been cut by Gilbert and Sullivan or the company over the years . Gubbay felt over @-@ committed by 2003 and pulled out . After fifteen years , with no Arts Council funding forthcoming , the company suspended productions in May 2003 . 
 From May to July 2013 , Scottish Opera produced a British touring production of The Pirates of Penzance in partnership with the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company , although it was not reported what role the latter company took in the producing team . Richard Suart played Major @-@ General Stanley and Nicholas <unk> played Frederic . The Daily Telegraph , The Guardian and The Times each gave the production three out of five stars . The company is co @-@ producing The Mikado with Scottish Opera on tour in May to July 2016 , directed by Martin Lloyd @-@ Evans and starring Suart , <unk> , Andrew Shore and Rebecca <unk> . 
 = = Principal performers = = 
 Gilbert and Sullivan aficionados frequently use the names of the principal comedians of the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company to refer to time periods of the company 's history . Thus , after the sudden death of Sullivan 's brother Fred , who had created the role of the Learned Judge in Trial by Jury in 1875 , the unknown George Grossmith was recruited in 1877 . Before Grossmith left the company in 1889 , he created the principal comic roles in nine of the operas , and so the principal comedian parts in the operas are often referred to as the " Grossmith " roles . Other performers who created a long series of roles in the original productions of the operas included baritone Rutland Barrington , mezzo @-@ soprano Jessie Bond , soprano Leonora Braham , contralto Rosina Brandram , tenor Durward Lely and bass @-@ baritone Richard Temple . In the original New York City productions and British touring productions , soprano Geraldine <unk> , baritone Signor <unk> , comic George Thorne and bass @-@ baritone Fred Billington became particularly well known . 
 After Grossmith left the company , the most notable players of his roles during the rest of Gilbert 's lifetime were Walter Passmore ( principal comedian from 1894 to 1903 ) and Charles H. Workman , who played the roles on tour with the company from 1897 and took over as principal comedian at the Savoy between 1906 and 1909 . Both of these performers made recordings of songs from the Savoy operas . During the Passmore era , principal players of the company included Brandram and Barrington , as well as tenor Robert <unk> , soprano Isabel Jay , sopranos Ruth Vincent and Florence St. John , tenor Courtice Pounds and his sister , mezzo @-@ soprano Louie Pounds . During Workman 's tenure , principal players included contralto Louie René , soprano Clara Dow , Leo Sheffield , and a young Henry Lytton . No complete recordings of the operas were made that included active members of the Company until the 1920s . Workman and W. S. Gilbert quarrelled over their production of Fallen Fairies in 1909 , and Gilbert banned Workman from appearing in his works in Britain . It is likely that , otherwise , Workman would have continued as principal comedian of the company . Indeed , Rupert D 'Oyly Carte wrote to Workman in 1919 asking him to return to the company as principal comedian , but Workman declined . 
 From 1909 to 1934 , the principal comedian was Henry Lytton , who had been playing a variety of roles with the company steadily since 1887 . He received a knighthood for his performances during his long tenure with the company . Lytton 's voice deteriorated during his later career , and when HMV embarked on a series of complete recordings of the operas after World War I , Lytton was not invited to record most of his roles . Instead , the concert singer George Baker was brought in to substitute . Other performers from this period include mezzo @-@ soprano Nellie <unk> , bass @-@ baritone Darrell Fancourt , who is estimated to have portrayed the Mikado of Japan more than 3 @,@ 000 times , contralto Bertha Lewis , tenor Derek Oldham , soprano Elsie Griffin and baritones Leo Sheffield and Sydney Granville . 
 Lytton was succeeded in 1934 by Martyn Green , who played the principal comic parts until 1951 , except for a gap from the end of 1939 to 1946 , when Grahame Clifford replaced him . Green 's time with the company is remembered for the early Decca recordings of the operas . During Green 's tenure , in addition to the long @-@ serving Fancourt , principal players included baritone Richard Walker , soprano Helen Roberts , mezzo @-@ soprano Marjorie Eyre , baritone Leslie <unk> and contralto Ella <unk> . Green was followed by Peter Pratt . He left the company in 1959 , after more than eight years as principal comedian , still only 36 years old . During Pratt 's years , principals included bass @-@ baritone Donald Adams , tenor Leonard Osborn ( who later directed the productions ) , contralto Ann Drummond @-@ Grant and mezzo @-@ soprano Joyce Wright . 
 Pratt 's successor was John Reed , who served as principal comedian for two decades . Other stars from this era were Thomas Round , Donald Adams , Gillian Knight , Valerie Masterson and Kenneth Sandford , all of whom , except the last , left the company for the wider operatic stage of Covent Garden , Sadler 's Wells , English National Opera , Aix @-@ en @-@ Provence and elsewhere . When Reed left the company in 1979 , his understudy James Conroy @-@ Ward took over until the closure of the company in 1982 . 
 From 1988 , the revived company used guest artists for each production . The most regularly seen principal comedians were Eric Roberts and Richard Suart , both of whom regularly perform the " Grossmith " roles for other opera companies . Others have included Sam Kelly , Jasper <unk> and Simon Butteriss . 
 = Radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant = 
 The Rocky Flats Plant , a former U.S. nuclear weapons production facility located about 15 miles northwest of Denver , caused radioactive ( primarily plutonium , americium , and uranium ) contamination within and outside its boundaries . The contamination primarily resulted from two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 ( plutonium is pyrophoric and shavings can spontaneously combust ) and from wind @-@ blown plutonium that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste . Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational life of the plant from 1952 to 1992 , from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of plutonium particles too small to be filtered . Prevailing winds from the plant swept airborne contamination south and east , into populated areas northwest of Denver . 
 The contamination of the Denver area by plutonium from the fires and other sources was not publicly reported until the 1970s . According to a 1972 study coauthored by Edward Martell , " In the more densely populated areas of Denver , the Pu contamination level in surface soils is several times fallout " , and the plutonium contamination " just east of the Rocky Flats plant ranges up to hundreds of times that from nuclear tests . " As noted by Carl Johnson in <unk> , " Exposures of a large population in the Denver area to plutonium and other radionuclides in the exhaust plumes from the plant date back to 1953 . " 
 Weapons production at the plant was halted after a combined FBI and EPA raid in 1989 and years of protests . The plant has since been shut down , with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site . The Rocky Flats Plant was declared a Superfund site in 1989 and began its transformation to a cleanup site in February 1992 . Removal of the plant and surface contamination was largely completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s . Nearly all underground contamination was left in place , and measurable radioactive environmental contamination in and around Rocky Flats will probably persist for thousands of years . The land formerly occupied by the plant is now the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge . Plans to make this refuge accessible for recreation have been repeatedly delayed due to lack of funding and protested by citizen organizations . The Department of Energy continues to fund monitoring of the site , but private groups and researchers remain concerned about the extent and long @-@ term public health consequences of the contamination . Estimates of the public health risk caused by the contamination vary significantly , with accusations that the United States government is being too secretive and that citizen activists are being alarmist . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Rocky Flats Plant was located south of Boulder , Colorado and northwest of Denver . Originally under management of the Dow Chemical Company , management was transferred to Rockwell in 1975 . Initially having an area of 4 sq mi ( 10 km2 ) , the site was expanded with a 4 @,@ 600 acres ( 19 km2 ) buffer zone in 1972 . 
 Construction of the first buildings was started on the site on July 10 , 1951 . Production of parts for nuclear weapons began in 1953 . At the time , the precise nature of the work at Rocky Flats was a closely guarded secret . The plant produced fission cores for nuclear weapons , used to " ignite " fusion and fissionable fuel in all modern nuclear weapons . Fission cores resemble miniaturized versions of the Fat Man nuclear bomb detonated above Nagasaki . They are often referred to as " triggers " in official and news documents to obfuscate their function . For much of its operational lifetime , Rocky Flats was the sole mass @-@ producer of plutonium components for America 's nuclear stockpile . 
 Management of the site passed to EG & G in 1990 , which did not reapply for the contract in 1994 . Management of the site then passed to the Kaiser @-@ Hill Company as of July 1 , 1995 . The Department of Energy now manages the central portion of the plant where production buildings were once located , while the Fish and Wildlife Service has taken over management of the peripheral outer unit . 
 = = = 1957 fire = = = 
 On the evening of September 11 , 1957 , plutonium shavings in a glove box located in building 771 ( the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility ) spontaneously ignited . The fire spread to the flammable glove box materials , including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves . The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and ignited the large bank of High @-@ efficiency particulate air ( <unk> ) filters located in a plenum downstream . Within minutes the first filters had burned out , allowing plutonium particles to escape from the building exhaust stacks . The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10 : 40 PM , which ended the majority of the plutonium release . Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical . They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective . 
 The 1957 fire released 11 @-@ 36 Ci ( 160 – 510 grams or 0 @.@ 35 – 1 @.@ 12 pounds ) of plutonium , much of which contaminated off @-@ site areas as microscopic particles entrained in smoke from the fire . <unk> diagrams from studies show portions of the city of Denver included in the area where surface sampling detected plutonium . The fact that the fire had resulted in significant plutonium contamination of surrounding populated areas remained secret . News reports at the time reported , per the Atomic Energy Commission 's briefing , that there was slight risk of light contamination and that no fire fighters had been contaminated . No abnormal radioactivity was reported by the Colorado Public Health Service . 
 = = = Pad 903 leakage = = = 
 Plutonium milling operations produced large quantities of toxic cutting fluid contaminated with particles of plutonium and uranium . Thousands of 55 @-@ gallon drums of the waste were stored outside in an unprotected earthen area called the 903 pad storage area , where they corroded and leaked radionuclides over years into the soil and water . An estimated 5 @,@ 000 gallons of plutonium @-@ contaminated oil leached into the soil between 1964 and 1967 . Portions of this waste , mixed with dust that composed Pad 903 , became airborne in the heavy winds of the Front Range and contaminated offsite areas to the south and east . 
 Leaking storage barrels at Pad 903 released 1 @.@ 4 @-@ 15 Ci ( 19 – 208 grams or 0 @.@ 042 – 0 @.@ 459 pounds ) of plutonium as airborne dust during the storage and subsequent attempts at cleanup . Much more remains interred under the Pad 903 area , which has been paved over with asphalt . 
 = = = 1969 fire = = = 
 Another major fire occurred on May 11 , 1969 in building 776 / 777 ( the Plutonium Processing Facility ) , again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box . Fire fighters again resorted to fighting the fire with water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective . Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire , suppression systems were not built into the glove boxes . 
 While the fire bore marked similarities to the 1957 fire , the level of contamination was less severe because the <unk> filters in the exhaust system did not burn through ( After the 1957 fire , the filter material was changed from cellulose to nonflammable fiberglass ) . Had the filters failed or the roof ( which sustained heavy fire damage ) been breached , the release could have been more severe than the 1957 fire . About 1 @,@ 400 kilograms ( 3 @,@ 100 lb ) of plutonium was in the storage area where the fire occurred , and about 3 @,@ 400 kilograms ( 7 @,@ 500 lb ) total plutonium was in building 776 / 777 . 
 The 1969 fire released 13 @-@ 62 mCi ( 140 – 900 milligrams or 0 @.@ 00031 – 0 @.@ <unk> pounds ) of plutonium , about 1000th as much as was released in the 1957 fire . The 1969 fire , however , led local health officials to perform independent tests of the area surrounding Rocky Flats to determine the extent of the contamination . This resulted in the first releases of information to the public that populated areas southeast of Rocky Flats had been contaminated . 
 = = = Other sources = = = 
 Hundreds of other small plutonium fires and intentional <unk> also occurred at Rocky Flats that were not nearly as destructive . 
 Rockwell workers mixed hazardous and other wastes with concrete to create one @-@ ton solid blocks called <unk> . These were stored in the open under tarps on asphalt pads . The <unk> turned out to be weak storage , an outcome that had been predicted by Rockwell 's own engineers . Relatively unprotected from the elements , the blocks began to leak and sag . Nitrates , cadmium and low @-@ level radioactive waste began to leach into the ground and run downhill toward Walnut Creek and Woman Creek . 
 Most of the plutonium from Rocky Flats was oxidized plutonium , which does not readily dissolve in water . A large portion of the plutonium released into the creeks sank to the bottom and is now found in the streambeds of Walnut and Woman Creeks , and on the bottom of local public reservoirs just outside Rocky Flats : Great Western Reservoir , ( no longer used for city of Broomfield drinking water consumption as of 1997 but still used for irrigation ) , and Standley Lake , a drinking water supply for the cities of Westminster , Thornton , <unk> and some residents of Federal Heights . As one of several forms of remediation and once the extent of the lapses at Rocky Flats became public knowledge , several streams that were formed by drainage through the contaminated areas of the Rocky Flats Plant were diverted such that they would no longer flow directly into some of the local reservoirs , such as Mower Reservoir and Standley Lake . Also , a surface water control system was built to allow runoff from contaminated creeks to collect in holding ponds and thus reduce or prevent direct runoff into Standley Lake . Proposals to remove or breach some of these dams to reduce the cost of maintenance have been protested by the cities downstream . 
 = = Reporting of contamination = = 
 No radioactivity warning , advisement or cleanup was provided to the public in the 1957 fire , the worse of the two major fires . At the time of the 1957 fire , AEC officials told the Denver Post that the fire “ resulted in no spread of radioactive contamination of any consequence . ” The public was not informed of substantial contamination from the 1957 plutonium fire until after the highly visible 1969 fire , when civilian monitoring teams confronted government officials with measurements made outside the plant of radioactive contamination suspected to be from the 1969 fire , which consumed hundreds of pounds of plutonium ( 850 kg ) . 
 The 1969 fire raised public awareness of potential hazards posed by the plant and led to years of increasing citizen protests and demands for plant closure . Releases from previous years had not been reported publicly prior to the fire ; airborne @-@ become @-@ <unk> radioactive contamination extending well beyond the Rocky Flats plant was not publicly reported until the 1970s . 
 In 2002 , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveyed tissues harvested from deer that lived at Rocky Flats for plutonium and other actinides . Isotopes of plutonium , americium , and uranium were detected , with the highest measured activity being 0 @.@ <unk> pCi / g ( 2360 seconds per disintegration ) for uranium @-@ 233 or uranium @-@ 234 . The increased cancer risk , as reported by the study , to an individual who ate 28 kilograms ( 62 lb ) of Rocky Flats deer meat per year over a 70 @-@ year lifetime was estimated to be as high as 1 in 210 @,@ 000 . This is near the conservative end of the EPA 's acceptable risk range . 
 In 2010 , samples of plutonium were found off @-@ site from Rocky Flats by citizens of the area . " High concentrations of plutonium were found in dust collected in a crawl space under a house where it had accumulated for 50 years . Specialist Marco <unk> of the Boston Chemical Data Corp. , who did the technical analysis of the samples , pointed out that this plutonium laden dust certainly endangered the health of anyone who spent much time in this crawl space . "

 Plutonium @-@ 239 and 240 emit ionizing radiation in the form of alpha particles . Inhalation is the primary pathway by which plutonium enters the body , though plutonium can also enter the body through a wound . Once inhaled , plutonium increases the risk of lung cancer , liver cancer , bone cancer , and leukemia . Once absorbed into the body , the biological half life of plutonium is about 200 years . 
 Following the public 1969 fire , surveys were taken of the land outside the boundaries of Rocky Flats to quantify the amount of plutonium contamination . Researchers noted that plutonium contamination from the plant was present , but did not match the wind conditions of the 1969 fire . The 1957 fire and leaking barrels on Pad 903 have since been confirmed to be the main sources of plutonium contamination . Authors Krey and Hardy estimated the total quantity of plutonium contamination outside of Rocky Flats 's boundaries to be 2 @.@ 6 Ci ( 36 grams or 0 @.@ 079 pounds ) , while Poet and Martell estimated the value to be 6 @.@ 6 Ci ( 92 grams or 0 @.@ 203 pounds ) . The study also noted that plutonium levels just outside the boundaries of the plant were hundreds of times higher than the background level caused by global fallout from nuclear testing , and that contamination to the north of the plant was probably caused by normal operations rather than accidental releases . 
 In a 1981 study by Dr. Carl Johnson , health director for Jefferson County , showed a 45 percent increase in congenital birth defects in Denver suburbs downwind of Rocky Flats compared to the rest of Colorado . Moreover , he found a 16 % increase in cancer rates for those living closest to the plant as compared to those on the outer perimeter of the area , and he estimated 491 excess cancer cases whereas the DOE estimated one . Real estate interests pressed the county to fire Johnson , claiming his findings hurt their industry . After electing a real estate investor to the county board , they succeeded . A 1987 study by Crump and others did not find the cancer rates in the northwestern portion of Denver to be significantly higher than other parts of the city and attributed variance in cancer rates to the population density of urban areas . Crump 's conclusions were contested by Johnson in a letter to the journal editor . In a 1992 survey of radiation risk analysis , the authors concluded , " Johnson failed to describe an effective and complete model for the cause of the cancers and its relationship to other knowledge as Crump et al. have done . Therefore , Crump et al . ' s explanation must be preferred . " 
 In 1983 , Colorado University Medical School professor John C. Cobb and the EPA reported plutonium concentrations from about 500 persons who had died in Colorado . A comparison study was done of those who lived near Rocky Flats with those who lived far from this nuclear weapons production site . The ratio of Pu @-@ 240 to Pu @-@ 239 was " minutely lower " for persons who lived within 50 km of Rocky Flats , but was more strongly correlated to age , gender , and smoking habits than proximity to the plant . 
 In 1991 , the Department of Energy 's public affairs group published a pamphlet stating that the inhalation of sediments that become resuspended in the air is considered the most significant pathway that could expose human beings to plutonium from the contaminated local reservoirs , but also stated that the airborne plutonium concentrations as measured by downwind air monitors remained below the DOE standard . 
 In a 1999 analysis , it was found that " the major event contributing the highest individual risk from plutonium released from Rocky Flats was the 1957 fire , " with wind distribution of plutonium from the 903 Pad Storage Area being the next greatest source of health risk . In this report , health risk estimates for off @-@ site humans had a variance of four orders of magnitude , from " between 2 @.@ 0 × 10 − 4 ( 95th percentile ) and 2 @.@ 2 × 10 − 8 ( 5th percentile ) , with a median risk estimate of 2 @.@ 3 × 10 − 6 . " The DOE maintains a list of Rocky Flats epidemiological studies . 
 In 2003 , Dr. James <unk> led a study on the health effects of plutonium . Conducted by the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment , the study concluded that lung cancer is linked to plutonium inhalation . " We have supporting evidence from other studies that , along with our findings , support the hypothesis that plutonium exposure causes lung cancer , " <unk> said . His group 's findings were part of a broader study that tracked 16 @,@ 303 people who worked at the Rocky Flats plant between 1952 and 1989 . Their research also found that these workers were 2 @.@ 5 times more likely to develop brain tumors than other people .

 Subsequent to reports of environmental crimes being committed at Rocky Flats , the United States Department of Justice sponsored an FBI raid dubbed " Operation Desert Glow , " which began at 9 a.m. on June 6 , 1989 . The FBI entered the premises under the ruse of providing a terrorist threat briefing , and served its search warrant to Dominick <unk> , Rockwell International 's manager of Rocky Flats . 
 The FBI raid led to the formation of Colorado 's first special grand jury , the juried testimony of 110 witnesses , reviews of 2 @,@ 000 exhibits and ultimately a 1992 plea agreement in which Rockwell admitted to 10 federal environmental crimes and agreed to pay $ 18 @.@ 5 million in fines out of its own funds . This amount was less than the company had been paid in bonuses for running the plant as determined by the GAO , and yet was also by far the highest hazardous @-@ waste fine ever ; four times larger than the previous record . Due to DOE indemnification of its contractors , without some form of settlement being arrived at between the U.S. Justice Department and Rockwell the cost of paying any civil penalties would ultimately have been borne by U.S. taxpayers . While any criminal penalties allotted to Rockwell would not have been covered by U.S. taxpayers , Rockwell claimed that the Department of Energy had specifically exempted them from most environmental laws , including hazardous waste . 
 As forewarned by the prosecuting U.S. Attorney , Ken <unk> ( later Ken Scott ) , the Department of Justice 's stated findings and plea agreement with Rockwell were heavily contested by its own , 23 @-@ member special grand jury . Press leaks by both members of the DOJ and the grand jury occurred in violation of secrecy Rule 6 ( e ) regarding Grand Jury information . The public contest led to U.S. Congressional oversight committee hearings chaired by Congressman Howard <unk> , which issued subpoenas to DOJ principals despite several instances of the DOJ 's refusal to comply . The hearings , whose findings include that the Justice Department had " bargained away the truth , " ultimately still did not fully reveal the special grand jury 's report to the public , which remains sealed by the DOJ courts . 
 The special grand jury report was nonetheless leaked to Westword . According to its subsequent publications , the Rocky Flats special grand jury had compiled indictments charging three DOE officials and five Rockwell employees with environmental crimes . The grand jury also wrote a report , intended for the public 's consumption per their charter , lambasting the conduct of DOE and Rocky Flats contractors for " engaging in a continuing campaign of distraction , deception and dishonesty " and noted that Rocky Flats , for many years , had discharged pollutants , hazardous materials and radioactive matter into nearby creeks and Broomfield 's and Westminster 's water supplies . 
 The DOE itself , in a study released in December of the year prior to the FBI raid , called Rocky Flats ' ground water the single greatest environmental hazard at any of its nuclear facilities . From the grand jury 's report : " The DOE reached this conclusion because the groundwater contamination was so extensive , toxic , and migrating toward the drinking water supplies for the Cities of Broomfield and Westminster , Colorado . " 
 A class action lawsuit , Cook v. Rockwell International Corp. , was filed in January 1990 against Rockwell and Dow Chemical ( due to the indemnity of nuclear contractors , the award would have be paid by the federal government ) . Sixteen years later , the plaintiffs were awarded $ 926 million in economic damages , punitive damages , and interest . The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently threw out the verdict and ordered a retrial . A further appeal was rejected without comment by the United States Supreme Court in June 2012 . 
 Carl Johnson sued Jefferson County for unlawful termination , after he was forced to resign from his position as Director of the Jefferson County Health Department . He alleged that his termination was due to concerns by the board members that his reports of contamination would lower property values . The suit was settled out of court for $ 150 @,@ 000 .

 Denver 's automotive beltway does not include a component in the northwest sector , partly due to concerns over <unk> plutonium contamination . 
 In 2006 , according to DOE , " The selected remedy / corrective action for the Peripheral OU is no action . The RI / FS report ( <unk> Facility Investigation @-@ Remedial Investigation / Corrective Measures <unk> Feasibility Study ) concludes that the Peripheral OU is already in a state protective of human health and the environment . " 
 In 2007 , the " Peripheral <unk> Unit " ( Peripheral OU ) land area of Rocky Flats was redesignated as the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge and fell under U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) stewardship in 2007 following the EPA ’ s determination that final corrective actions had been completed . According to the USFWS , " the refuge has remained closed to the public due to a lack of appropriations for refuge management operations " . The U.S. Government 's efforts to make the area surrounding the former plant into the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge have been controversial due to the contamination , much of which is underground and not remediated . The substantially contaminated " Central <unk> Unit " ( <unk> ) land area of Rocky Flats remains under DOE control , and is now surrounded by the refuge . 
 Plutonium 239 , with a 24 @,@ 000 year half life , will persist in the environment hundreds of thousands of years . The DOE 's assessment of the Central Operating Unit indicates that the long @-@ term risk to citizens living outside the boundaries of Rocky Flats is negligible , but citizen organizations state that the remediation of the site was inadequate . 
 = = Public opposition = = 
 On the weekend of April 28 , 1979 , more than 15 @,@ 000 people demonstrated against the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant . The protest was coordinated with other anti @-@ nuclear demonstrations across the country . Daniel Ellsberg and Allen Ginsberg were among the 284 people who were arrested . The demonstration followed more than six months of continuous protests that included an attempted blockade of the railroad tracks leading to the site . Large pro @-@ nuclear counter demonstrations were also staged that year . 
 On October 15 , 1983 , about 10 @,@ 000 demonstrators turned out for protest at Rocky Flats ( well short of the 21 @,@ 000 hoped for by protest organizers ) . No arrests were made . On August 10 , 1987 ( the 42nd anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki ) , 320 demonstrators were arrested after they tried to force a one @-@ day shutdown of the plant . A similar protest with a turnout of about 3 @,@ 500 was staged on August 6 , 1989 ( the anniversary of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima ) . 
 Though public demonstrations against plant operations ceased with the decommissioning of the plant , protests have continued regarding the disposal of nuclear waste from the site and the scale and scope of cleanup operations . Since 2013 , opposition has focused on the Candelas development located along the southern border of the former Plant site . 
 = New York State Route 17M = 
 New York State Route 17M ( NY 17M ) is an east – west state highway in Orange County , New York , in the United States . It extends for 26 @.@ 63 miles ( 42 @.@ 86 km ) from west of the city of Middletown to what is currently the north – south section of NY 17 just southeast of the village of Harriman . It is a busy main street in Middletown and the village of Monroe ; in the former , it divides into a parkway for several blocks and forms the city 's major commercial strip , located between the downtown district and an interchange with Interstate 84 ( I @-@ 84 ) . The rest of the road is a two @-@ lane rural route . Between New Hampton and Goshen , the highway overlaps with U.S. Route 6 ( US 6 ) . The easternmost section of that overlap near Goshen is routed on the Quickway , making a three @-@ route concurrency with NY 17 . 
 Most of NY 17M follows the course used by NY 17 prior to the construction of the Quickway through the Catskill Mountains . The first section of the Quickway opened in 1951 and extended from Fair Oaks to Goshen . NY 17M was initially assigned to NY 17 's old surface routing between Fair Oaks and Middletown ; however , it was extended east to Harriman and , for a brief time , northwest to <unk> as more sections of the freeway were completed .

 County Route 76 ( CR 76 ) becomes NY 17M when the highway passes through the site of a former interchange ( once exit 118A ) with the nearby Quickway ( NY 17 ) in the town of Wallkill , located in northern Orange County . The junction was just north of the former right @-@ of @-@ way of the New York , Ontario and Western Railway , which NY 17M crosses as it makes its way southward over some gentle , lightly developed hills . After 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) , the road reaches a signalized intersection with NY 302 , its first junction with another state highway . The junction currently serves as NY 302 's southern terminus ; however , NY 302 once continued south to Middletown by way of an overlap with NY 17M . Continuing on , NY 17M traverses increasingly developed areas , passing through the hamlet of Rockville on its way to the densely populated neighborhood of Washington Heights , situated just outside Middletown . 
 The route seamlessly passes from Washington Heights to Middletown , where it becomes known as North Street . The street is initially fairly wide — featuring shoulders on each side — but it narrows in the residential neighborhoods closer to the city 's center . Upon reaching the northern edge of Middletown 's central business district , the route turns right onto Wickham Avenue , which carries NY 211 through northern Middletown . The resulting overlap between NY 17M and NY 211 is a wrong @-@ way concurrency : NY 17M eastbound is concurrent with NY 211 westbound and vice versa . NY 17M and NY 211 head west along the fringe of downtown , climbing slightly in elevation as the street passes through mostly residential areas . After seven blocks , Wickham Avenue merges into West Main Street ; however , the road 's surroundings remain unchanged . 
 NY 17M and NY 211 continue along West Main Street for another four blocks , traversing a slight westerly turn in the street prior to intersecting Monhagen Avenue in the western part of the city . Both routes leave Main Street here : NY 211 turns right , following the road northwest toward Otisville while NY 17M heads left , proceeding southeastward toward downtown . It continues through a six @-@ block commercial and residential area to Mill Street , at which point Monhagen Avenue becomes Fulton Street and expands to become a parkway with a tree @-@ lined median strip . This stretch continues for five blocks along the southern edge of downtown Middletown to Academy Avenue , where NY 17M turns right and heads southward . After just two blocks , the route changes streets for the final time in Middletown , veering left onto <unk> Avenue . 
 = = = East of Middletown = = = 
 As <unk> Avenue , NY 17M passes by a single residential block before entering a linear commercial district that follows the highway to an interchange with I @-@ 84 roughly 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) to the south . The route initially remains two lanes wide , but widens to four lanes after crossing the Middletown and New Jersey Railway at @-@ grade . This stretch of NY 17M also features a center left @-@ turn lane to accommodate the traffic turning into the many commercial plazas on either side . The road remains within the Middletown city limits until a block before the intersection where US 6 comes in from the west and joins NY 17M . Together , they cross over I @-@ 84 at exit 3 , providing access to the cities of Port Jervis and Newburgh in the western and eastern parts of the county , respectively . 
 Just past I @-@ 84 , the Wawayanda hamlet of New Hampton begins , with car dealerships and other commercial establishments on either side . The road narrows to two lanes as the combined highways begin a slow , gentle descent through less developed areas to the bridge over the Wallkill River , situated at the northern tip of the county 's Black Dirt Region . Short sections of the approach on either side add a passing lane in the uphill direction . The river marks the Goshen town line , and the slight climb out of the river depression is accompanied again with some extra lanes . Past the climb , development aside the road picks up slightly , although most of the land around the highway remains undeveloped as open fields or forests . US 6 and NY 17M continue to the western outskirts of the village of Goshen , where they merge into NY 17 at exit 123 . 
 NY 17M follows the Quickway for about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , meeting NY 17A and NY 207 at an interchange ( exit 124 ) in a commercialized area southwest of the center of Goshen . It ultimately leaves the Quickway before US 6 does , splitting from the highway at exit 125 . From here to the village of Chester , NY 17M closely follows the NY 17 freeway , serving a handful of homes in an otherwise undeveloped area adjacent to the Quickway . In Chester , NY 17M becomes Brookside Avenue and intersects with NY 94 in the commercial center of the community . It continues on , passing through the rural areas of the southern portion of the town of Blooming Grove prior to becoming heavily developed as it passes into the town of Monroe . 
 Just inside the town line , NY 17M turns southward , leaving the vicinity of the Quickway and entering the village of Monroe . It bypasses the downtown portion of the village and its historic district to the west and south . Despite this fact , it still serves as one of the community 's major commercial strips , intersecting NY 208 in a built @-@ up area due west of downtown . The route continues to the east , serving commercial and residential areas on its way to the nearby village of Harriman . Development abates slightly past Harriman as NY 17M continues with a slight southward bent towards its final junction with NY 17 just outside the Harriman village limits in the town and village of Woodbury .

 = = = Origins and designation = = = 
 What is now NY 17M was originally designated as part of Route 4 by the New York State Legislature in 1908 . The unsigned legislative route extended across the Southern Tier of New York , beginning near the shores of Lake Erie in Westfield and ending at the Hudson River in Highland Falls . The first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , at which time most of legislative Route 4 was designated as NY 17 . While Route 4 went northeast from Harriman , NY 17 continued south from the village toward the New Jersey state line . 
 In the late 1940s , construction began on the Quickway , a limited @-@ access highway connecting Binghamton to Harriman by way of the NY 17 corridor . The first portion to be built was the section between exit 118A in Fair Oaks and exit 123 near Goshen , which opened to traffic in July 1951 . NY 17 was subsequently realigned to bypass Middletown to the northeast on the new freeway while the former routing of NY 17 between US 6 south of Middletown and the new Fair Oaks interchange was redesignated as NY 17M . The remainder of old NY 17 from Middletown to Goshen remained part of US 6 , which had overlapped with NY 17 between Middletown and Goshen . 
 The Goshen – Chester and Chester – Harriman segments of the Quickway were completed in October 1954 and August 1955 , respectively , creating a continuous limited @-@ access highway between Fair Oaks and the New York State Thruway . US 6 and NY 17 were moved onto the highway as sections opened to traffic , while NY 17M was extended eastward along NY 17 's old routing to Harriman following the completion of the Quickway between Chester and the Thruway . On October 23 , 1958 , the portion of the Quickway between Fair Oaks and <unk> ( exit 114 ) was completed as part of a realigned NY 17 . The former surface routing of NY 17 between the two locations initially became part of NY 17M ; however , this extension was eliminated in the late 1960s . 
 = = = Realignment and ramp closure = = = 
 NY 17M originally followed a slightly different alignment through downtown Middletown . When the route was first assigned , it continued south from Wickham Avenue on North Street , proceeding into what was then the main commercial hub of the city . The highway rejoined its modern alignment at the intersection of South Street and Fulton Street south of downtown . In 1969 , the city of Middletown began planning a project that would rehabilitate part of North Street . As part of the project , the section of North Street between Orchard Street and Main Street would be closed to traffic and converted into a pedestrian mall . The street was closed in early 1970 , forcing NY 17M to be realigned onto Wickham Avenue , West Main Street , and Monhagen Avenue . The pedestrian mall project faced opposition from business owners , leading to its cancellation on February 9 , 1970 . North Street was reopened one day later ; however , the rerouting of NY 17M proved to be permanent . 
 When the Quickway was first built , exit 118A was made up of two ramps , one leading from NY 17 eastbound to NY 17M and another connecting NY 17M westbound to NY 17 westbound . The exit was eliminated at some point after 1996 . The westbound on @-@ ramp was converted into a residential street known as Sands Road West while the eastbound half of the exit was completely removed . As a result , NY 17M 's western terminus is no longer at an intersecting road . Instead , the highway simply changes from a state highway to a county road at the former site of the exit .

 The Wild Flower and the Rose is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company . The film focuses on Frank Wilson , the son of an inventor who has constructed a new airplane model . After failing to secure financing , his father suggests that he marry Rose , the daughter of his wealthy employer , to get the money they need . Jack rejects this idea because he is engaged to another woman , but he soon learns she does not love him . He heads out West to seek a fortune and is quickly successful . He returns to the aviation field and meets Rose again , after a successful flight she confesses to loving him . The cast and staff credits are unknown , but the film may have included scenes from the 1910 International Aviation Meet at Belmont Park . One reviewer claimed that a Wright brothers flyer was also shown in full flight . The film was released on November 25 , 1910 , but is now presumed lost .

 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from November 26 , 1910 . It states : " Frank Wilson is the son of an inventor who has perfected an airship model in which Jack is greatly interested , but which neither of them have the money to finance . Wilson tries to interest his wealthy employer , Fisher , but is unsuccessful in the attempt . However he gains the support of his employer 's beautiful daughter , Rose . The old inventor suggests to his son that if he marries Rose they could secure the money to perfect the invention . But Jack spurns the idea , as he is already engaged to marry a country girl , Daisy Lane , who , he believes , loves him devotedly . Upon learning that Daisy is a heartless coquette , Jack is heartbroken , and goes west to seek a fortune and forget her conduct . Success comes to him quickly , and he returns to tell his father that now , unaided , they can finance the invention . On the aviation field , Jack once more meets Rose , and confesses to her that it was the memory of her kindness that helped him achieve success . Jack makes a successful flight in the invention – a new style of aeroplane – and in offering her congratulations Rose confesses that she has loved him from the first . "

 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson . Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith , Carl Louis Gregory , and Alfred H. Moses , Jr. though none are specifically credited . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . The cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list includes G.W. Abbe , Justus D. Barnes , Frank H. Crane , Irene Crane , Marie Eline , Violet Heming , Martin J. Faust , Thomas Fortune , George Middleton , Grace Moore , John W. Noble , Anna Rosemond , Mrs. George Walters . 
 It is unknown when the film was shot , but the aviation meet may have been at Belmont Park in Long Island , New York . The second International Aviation Meet took place from October 22 – 30 , 1910 . One newspaper would state that a " one of the Wright Brothers ' 1910 model flying machines " was shown in full flight .

 The single reel drama , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on November 25 , 1910 . The film had a wide national release , known advertising theaters include those in Nebraska , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , Arizona , Indiana , Montana , and Oklahoma , The New York Dramatic Mirror was neutral to slightly praising the production . The reviewer stated , " It is a discursive narrative , not bound by laws of cause and effect , although it does not contradict them . It is amusing to see the rapidity with which a motion picture hero goes West . He throws a toothbrush and his pajamas into a suitcase , takes his hat over his arm , and breaks the news to his father before stepping from the living room out into the street . The special point of this film is the aviation exhibition , which is well handled . The hero is a very <unk> gentleman , who smiles broadly with and without provocation . Other parts are adequately filled . " The Moving Picture World spared three roughly three sentences surrounding the focus of the plot , " A love story built up around the invention of a new type of aeroplane . The machine flies and the inventor gets the girl of his choice . The picture has , therefore , a pleasant ending . " 
 = Wyatt Earp = 
 Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp ( March 19 , 1848 – January 13 , 1929 ) was an American Old West gambler , a deputy sheriff in Pima County , and deputy town marshal in Tombstone , Arizona Territory , who took part in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral , during which lawmen killed three outlaw Cowboys . He is often regarded as the central figure in the shootout in Tombstone , although his brother Virgil was Tombstone city marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal that day , and had far more experience as a sheriff , constable , marshal , and soldier in combat . 
 Earp lived a restless life . He was at different times a constable , city policeman , county sheriff , Deputy U.S. Marshal , teamster , buffalo hunter , bouncer , saloon @-@ keeper , gambler , Brothel keeper , miner , and boxing referee . Earp spent his early life in Iowa . In 1870 , Earp married his first wife , Urilla Sutherland Earp , who contracted typhoid fever and died shortly before their first child was to be born . Within the next two years Earp was arrested , sued twice , escaped from jail , then was arrested three more times for " keeping and being found in a house of ill @-@ fame " . He landed in the cattle boomtown of Wichita , Kansas , where he became a deputy city marshal for one year and developed a solid reputation as a lawman . In 1876 , he followed his brother James to Dodge City , Kansas , where he became an assistant city marshal . In winter 1878 , he went to Texas to track down an outlaw and met John " Doc " Holliday , whom Earp later credited with saving his life . 
 Earp moved constantly throughout his life from one boomtown to another . He left Dodge City in 1879 and moved to Tombstone with his brothers James and Virgil , where a silver boom was underway . There , the Earps clashed with a loose federation of outlaws known as the Cowboys . Wyatt , Virgil , and their younger brother Morgan held various law enforcement positions that put them in conflict with Tom and Frank McLaury , and Ike and Billy Clanton , who threatened on several occasions to kill the Earps . The conflict escalated over the next year , culminating on October 26 , 1881 in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral , in which the Earps and Holliday killed three of the Cowboys . In the next five months , Virgil was ambushed and maimed , and Morgan was assassinated . Pursuing a vendetta , Wyatt , his brother Warren , Holliday , and others formed a federal posse that killed three of the Cowboys whom they thought responsible . Wyatt was never wounded in any of the gunfights , unlike his brothers Virgil and James or Doc Holliday , which only added to his mystique after his death . 
 Earp was a lifelong gambler and was always looking for a quick way to make money . After leaving Tombstone , Earp went to San Francisco where he reunited with Josephine Earp . She became his common @-@ law wife . They joined a gold rush to Eagle City , Idaho , where they owned mining interests and a saloon . They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego , California . Back in San Francisco , Wyatt raced horses again , but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons @-@ Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that he fixed the fight . They moved briefly to Yuma , Arizona before they joined the Alaskan Gold Rush to Nome , Alaska . They opened the biggest saloon in town and made a large sum of money . Returning to the lower 48 , they opened another saloon in Tonopah , Nevada , the site of a new gold find . In about 1911 , Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal , California , retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles . 
 When Earp died in 1929 , he was well known for his notorious handling of the Fitzsimmons @-@ Sharkey fight along with the O.K. Corral gun fight . An extremely flattering , largely fictionalized biography was published in 1931 after his death , becoming a bestseller and creating his reputation as a fearless lawman . Since then , Wyatt Earp has been the subject of and model for numerous films , TV shows , biographies , and works of fiction that have increased his mystique . Earp 's modern @-@ day reputation is that of the Old West 's " toughest and deadliest gunman of his day . " Until the book was published , Earp had a dubious reputation as a sometime Western lawman and gunfighter who had been arrested nine times and left more than one town with warrants for his arrest still outstanding . In modern times , Wyatt Earp has become synonymous with the stereotypical image of the Western lawman , and is a symbol of American frontier justice .

He was named after his father 's commanding officer in the Mexican – American War , Captain Wyatt Berry Stapp , of the 2nd Company Illinois Mounted Volunteers . Some evidence supports Wyatt Earp 's birthplace as 406 South 3rd Street in Monmouth , Illinois , though the street address is disputed by Monmouth College professor and historian William Urban . Monmouth is in Warren County in western Illinois . Wyatt had an elder half @-@ brother from his father 's first marriage , Newton , and a half @-@ sister Mariah Ann , who died at the age of ten months . 
 In March 1849 or in early 1850 , Nicholas Earp joined about one hundred other people in a plan to relocate to San Bernardino County , California , where he intended to buy farm land . Only 150 miles ( 240 km ) west of Monmouth , their daughter Martha became ill . The family stopped and Nicholas bought a new 160 acres ( 0 @.@ 65 km2 ) farm 7 miles ( 11 km ) northeast of Pella , Iowa . Martha died there on May 26 , 1856 . 
 Nicholas and Virginia Earp 's last child Adelia was born in June 1861 in Pella . Newton , James , and Virgil joined the Union Army on November 11 , 1861 . Their father was busy recruiting and drilling local companies , and Wyatt and his two younger brothers Morgan and Warren were left in charge of tending 80 @-@ acre ( 32 ha ) of corn . Wyatt was only thirteen years old , too young to enlist , but he tried on several occasions to run away and join the army . Each time , his father found him and brought him home . James was severely wounded in Fredericktown , Missouri , and returned home in summer 1863 . Newton and Virgil fought several battles in the east and later followed the family to California . 
 = = = California = = = 
 On May 12 , 1864 , Nicholas Earp organized a wagon train and headed to San Bernardino , California , arriving on December 17 , 1864 . By late summer 1865 , Virgil found work as a driver for Phineas Banning 's Stage Coach Line in California 's Imperial Valley , and 16 @-@ year @-@ old Wyatt assisted . In spring 1866 , Wyatt became a teamster , transporting cargo for Chris Taylor . From 1866 – 1868 , he drove cargo over the 720 miles ( 1 @,@ 160 km ) wagon road from Wilmington , through San Bernardino then Las Vegas , Nevada , to Salt Lake City , Utah Territory . 
 In spring 1868 , Earp was hired to transport supplies needed to build the Union Pacific Railroad . He learned gambling and boxing while working on the rail head in the Wyoming Territory . Earp developed a reputation officiating boxing matches and refereed a fight in front of 3000 spectators between John Shanssey and Mike Donovan on July 4 , 1869 in Cheyenne , Wyoming .

 In spring 1868 , the Earps moved east again to Lamar , Missouri , where Wyatt 's father Nicholas became the local constable . Wyatt rejoined the family the next year . Nicholas resigned as constable on November 17 , 1869 to become the justice of the peace , and Wyatt was appointed constable in his place . 
 In late 1869 , Earp courted 20 @-@ year @-@ old Urilla Sutherland ( c . 1849 – 1870 ) , the daughter of William and <unk> Sutherland , who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar . They were married by his father Nicholas in Lamar on January 10 , 1870 , and in August 1870 Wyatt bought a lot on the outskirts of town for $ 50 where he built a house . Urilla was pregnant and about to deliver their first child when she suddenly died from typhoid fever . In November , Earp sold the lot and a house on it for $ 75 . Hoping to keep the office that he 'd been appointed to , he ran against his elder half @-@ brother Newton for the office of constable . The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one way or another . Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton 's 108 , but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four @-@ way race . 
 = = = Lawsuits and charges = = = 
 After Urilla 's death , Wyatt went through a downward spiral and had a series of legal problems . On March 14 , 1871 , Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties . Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar , which funded local schools , and he was accused of failing to turn in the fees . On March 31 , James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp , alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment . To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed ( which he claimed to have paid ) , the court seized Cromwell 's mowing machine and sold it for $ 38 . Cromwell 's suit claimed that Earp owed him $ 75 , the estimated value of the machine . 
 On March 28 , 1871 Earp , Edward Kennedy , and John Shown were charged with stealing two horses , " each of the value of one hundred dollars " , from William Keys while in the Indian Country . On April 6 , Deputy United States Marshal J. G. Owens arrested Earp for the horse theft . Commissioner James Churchill arraigned Earp on April 14 , and set bail at $ 500 . On May 15 , an indictment was issued against Earp , Kennedy , and Shown . Anna Shown , John Shown 's wife , claimed that Earp and Kennedy got her husband drunk and then threatened his life to persuade him to help . On June 5 Edward Kennedy was acquitted while the case against Earp and John Shown remained . Earp did not wait for the trial . He climbed out through the roof of his jail and headed for Peoria , Illinois . 
 = = = Arrests in Peoria = = = 
 Years afterward , Wyatt 's biographer Stuart N. Lake wrote that Wyatt was hunting buffalo during the winter of 1871 – 72 . But Earp was arrested three times in the Peoria , Illinois area during that period . Earp is also listed in the Peoria city directory during 1872 as a resident in the house of Jane <unk> , who operated a brothel . In February 1872 , Peoria police raided the brothel , arresting four women and three men : Wyatt and Morgan Earp , and George Randall . They were charged with " Keeping and being found in a house of ill @-@ fame . " They were later fined twenty dollars plus costs for the criminal infraction . Wyatt Earp was arrested for the same crime on May 11 and again on September 10 , 1872 . The Peoria Daily National Democrat reported in September that Wyatt had been arrested aboard a floating brothel he owned named the Beardstown Gunboat with a woman named Sally <unk> , who called herself Wyatt Earp 's wife . 
 Some of the women are said to be good looking , but all appear to be terribly depraved . John Walton , the skipper of the boat and Wyatt Earp , the Peoria Bummer , were each fined $ 43 @.@ 15 . Sarah Earp , alias Sally <unk> , calls herself the wife of Wyatt Earp . 
 By calling Earp the " Peoria bummer " , the newspaper was including him in a class of " contemptible loafers who impose on hard @-@ working citizens , " a " beggar , " and worse than tramps . They were men of poor character who were chronic lawbreakers . 
 = = = Wichita , Kansas = = = 
 Wyatt moved to the growing cow town of Wichita in early 1874 , and local arrest records show that a prostitute named Sally Earp operated a brothel with the wife of his brother James from early 1874 to the middle of 1876 . Wyatt may have been a pimp , but historian Robert Gary L. Roberts believes it more likely that he was an enforcer , or a bouncer for the brothel . It is possible that he hunted buffalo during 1873 – 74 before he went to Wichita . When the Kansas state census was completed in June 1875 , Sally was no longer living with Wyatt , James , and Bessie . 
 Wichita was a railroad terminal and a destination for cattle drives from Texas . Like other frontier railroad terminals , when the cowboys accompanying the cattle drives arrived , the town was filled with drunken , armed cowboys celebrating the end of their long journey . <unk> were kept busy . When the cattle drives ended and the cowboys left , Earp searched for something else to do . A newspaper story in October 1874 reported that he earned some money helping an off @-@ duty police officer find thieves who had stolen a man 's wagon . Earp officially joined the Wichita marshal 's office on April 21 , 1875 , after the election of Mike Meagher as city marshal ( or police chief ) , making $ 100 per month . He also dealt faro at the Long Branch Saloon . In late 1875 , the Wichita Beacon newspaper published this story : 
 On last Wednesday ( December 8 ) , policeman Earp found a stranger lying near the bridge in a drunken stupor . He took him to the ' cooler ' and on searching him found in the neighborhood of $ 500 on his person . He was taken next morning , before his honor , the police judge , paid his fine for his fun like a little man and went on his way rejoicing . He may congratulate himself that his lines , while he was drunk , were cast in such a pleasant place as Wichita as there are but a few other places where that $ 500 bank roll would have been heard from . The integrity of our police force has never been seriously questioned . 
 Earp was embarrassed on January 9 , 1876 when he was sitting with friends in the back room of the Custom House Saloon when his loaded single @-@ action revolver fell out of his holster . It discharged when the hammer hit the floor . " The ball passed through his coat , struck the north wall then glanced off and passed out through the ceiling . " Wyatt was so red @-@ faced by the incident that years later he persuaded biographer Stuart Lake to omit it from his book Wyatt Earp , Frontier Marshal . 
 Wyatt 's stint as Wichita deputy came to a sudden end on April 2 , 1876 , when Earp took too active an interest in the city marshal 's election . According to news accounts , former marshal Bill Smith accused Wyatt of using his office to help hire his brothers as lawmen . Wyatt got into a fistfight with Smith and beat him . Meagher was forced to fire Earp and arrest him for disturbing the peace , which ended a tour of duty that the papers called otherwise " unexceptionable " . Meagher won the election , but the city council was split evenly on re @-@ hiring Earp . His brother James opened a brothel in Dodge City , and Wyatt left Wichita to join him . 
 = = = Dodge City , Kansas = = = 
 After 1875 , Dodge City became a major terminal for cattle drives from Texas along the Chisholm Trail . Earp was appointed assistant marshal in Dodge City under Marshal Lawrence " Larry " <unk> around May 1876 . There is evidence that Earp spent the winter of 1876 – 77 in another boomtown , Deadwood , Dakota Territory . He was not on the police force in Dodge City in late 1877 , but rejoined the force in spring 1877 at the request of mayor James H. " Dog " Kelley . The Dodge City newspaper reported in July 1878 that Earp had been fined $ 1 for slapping a muscular prostitute named Frankie Bell , who ( according to the papers ) " heaped epithets upon the <unk> head of Mr. Earp to such an extent as to provide a slap from the ex @-@ officer " . Bell spent the night in jail and was fined $ 20 , while Earp 's fine was the legal minimum . 
 In October 1877 , outlaw Dave Rudabaugh robbed a Sante Fe Railroad construction camp and fled south . Earp was given a temporary commission as Deputy U.S. Marshal and he left Dodge City , following Rudabaugh over 400 miles ( 640 km ) through Ft . Clark , Texas , where the newspaper reported his presence on January 22 , 1878 , and on to Fort Griffin , Texas . 
 He arrived at the frontier town on the Clear Fork of the Brazos River . Earp went to the Bee Hive Saloon , the largest in town and owned by John Shanssey , who Earp had known since he was 21 . Shanssey told Earp that Rudabaugh had passed through town earlier in the week , but he did not know where he was headed . Shanssey suggested that Earp ask gambler " Doc " Holliday , who had played cards with Rudabaugh . Holliday told Earp that Rudabaugh had headed back into Kansas . 
 By May 11 , 1878 , the Dodge newspapers reported that Wyatt had returned to Dodge City and on May 14 the Times noted that Wyatt had been appointed Assistant Marshal for the salary of $ 75 per month , serving under Charlie Bassett . Doc Holliday with his common @-@ law wife Big Nose Kate also showed up in Dodge City during the summer of 1878 . During the summer , Ed Morrison and other Texas cowboys rode into Dodge and shot up the town , galloping down Front Street . They entered the Long Branch Saloon , vandalized the room , and harassed the customers . Hearing the commotion , Wyatt burst through the front door into a bunch of guns pointing at him . Holliday was playing cards in the back and put his pistol at Morrison 's head , forcing him and his men to disarm . Earp credited Holliday with saving his life that day , and he and Earp became friends . 
 While in Dodge City , he became acquainted with James and Bat Masterson , Luke Short , and prostitute Celia Anne " Mattie " Blaylock . Blaylock became Earp 's common @-@ law wife until 1881 . Earp resigned from the Dodge City police force on September 9 , 1879 , and she accompanied him to Las Vegas in New Mexico Territory , and then to Tombstone in Arizona Territory . 
 = = = George Hoyt shooting = = = 
 At about 3 : 00 in the morning of July 26 , 1878 , George Hoyt ( spelled in some accounts as " Hoy " ) and other drunken cowboys shot their guns wildly , including three shots into Dodge City 's Comique Theater , causing comedian Eddie Foy to throw himself to the stage floor in the middle of his act . Fortunately , no one was injured . Assistant Marshal Earp and policeman Bat Masterson responded and " together with several citizens , turned their pistols loose in the direction of the fleeing horsemen " . As the riders crossed the Arkansas river bridge south of town , George Hoyt fell from his horse after he was wounded in the arm or leg . Earp told Stuart Lake that he saw Hoyt through his gun sights against the morning horizon and fired the fatal shot , killing him that day , but the Dodge City Times reported that Hoyt developed gangrene and died on August 21 after his leg was amputated . 
 = = Move to Tombstone , Arizona = = 
 In 1879 , Wyatt received a letter from his older brother Virgil , who was the town constable in Prescott , Arizona Territory . Virgil wrote Wyatt about the opportunities in the silver @-@ mining boomtown of Tombstone . In September 1879 , Wyatt resigned as assistant marshal in Dodge City . Accompanied by his common @-@ law wife Mattie Blaylock , his brother Jim and his wife Bessie , they left for Arizona Territory . They stopped in Las Vegas , New Mexico , where they reunited with Doc Holliday and his common @-@ law wife Big Nose Kate . The five of them arrived in Prescott in November . Wyatt , Virgil , and James Earp with their wives arrived in Tombstone on December 1 , 1879 , although Doc remained in Prescott , where the gambling afforded better opportunities . There , the Earps bought an interest in the <unk> mine , the First North Extension of the Mountain Maid mine , and some water rights . Later in life , Wyatt wrote that " In 1879 Dodge was beginning to lose much of the snap which had given it a charm to men of reckless blood , and I decided to move to Tombstone , which was just building up a reputation . " 
 On November 27 , 1879 , three days before moving to Tombstone , Virgil was appointed by Crawley Dake , U.S. Marshal for the Arizona Territory , as Deputy U.S. Marshal for the Tombstone mining district , some 280 miles ( 450 km ) from Prescott . His territory included all of the southeast area of the Arizona Territory . 
 On March 5 , 1879 , when the city of Tombstone was founded , it had about 100 people living in tents and a few shacks . By the time the Earps arrived nine months later on December 1 , it had grown to about 1 @,@ 000 residents . Wyatt brought horses and a buckboard wagon , which he planned to convert into a stagecoach , but on arrival he found two established stage lines already running . In Tombstone , the Earps staked mining claims and water rights interests , attempting to capitalize on the mining boom . Jim worked as a barkeep . On December 6 , 1879 , the three Earps and Robert J. Winders filed a location notice for the First North Extension of the Mountain Maid Mine . When none of their business interests proved fruitful , Wyatt was hired in April or May 1880 by Wells , Fargo & Co. agent Frederick James Dodge as a shotgun messenger on stagecoaches when they transported Wells Fargo <unk> . In summer 1880 , younger brothers Morgan arrived from Montana and Warren Earp moved to Tombstone as well . In September , Wyatt 's friend Doc Holliday arrived from Prescott with $ 40 @,@ 000 in gambling winnings in his pocket . 
 = = = First confrontation with the Cowboys = = = 
 On July 25 , 1880 , U.S. Army Captain Joseph H. Hurst asked Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp to assist him in tracking Cowboys who had stolen six U.S. Army mules from Camp Rucker . Virgil requested the assistance of his brothers Wyatt and Morgan , along with Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams , and they found the mules at the McLaurys ' ranch . McLaury was a Cowboy , a term which in that time and region was generally used to refer to a loose association of outlaws , some of whom also were landowners and ranchers . Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers . They found the branding iron used to change the " U.S. " brand to " <unk> " Stealing the mules was a federal offense because the animals were U.S. property . 
 Cowboy Frank Patterson " made some kind of a compromise " with Captain Hurst , who persuaded the posse to withdraw , with the understanding that the mules would be returned . The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps . In response , Capt. Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft , and specifically charged Frank McLaury with assisting with hiding the mules . He also reproduced the flyer in The Tombstone Epitaph , on July 30 , 1880 . Frank McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy @-@ friendly <unk> , calling Hurst " unmanly " , " a coward , a vagabond , a rascal , and a malicious liar " , and accused Hurst of stealing the mules himself . Capt. Hurst later cautioned Wyatt , Virgil , and Morgan that the Cowboys had threatened their lives . Virgil reported that Frank accosted him and warned him " If you ever again follow us as close as you did , then you will have to fight anyway . " A month later Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston , and they told him if he ever followed them as he had done before , they would kill him . 
 = = = Becomes deputy sheriff = = = 
 On July 28 , 1880 , Wyatt was appointed Deputy Sheriff for the eastern part of Pima County , which included Tombstone , by Democratic County Sheriff Charlie Shibell . Wyatt passed on his Wells Fargo job as shotgun messenger to his brother Morgan . Wyatt did his job well , and from August through November his name was mentioned nearly every week by the The Tombstone Epitaph or the Nugget newspapers . 
 The deputy sheriff 's position was worth more than US $ 40 @,@ 000 a year ( about $ 980 @,@ 828 today ) because he was also county assessor and tax collector , and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep ten percent of the amounts paid . While Wyatt was Deputy Sheriff , former Democrat state legislator Johnny Behan arrived in September 1880 . 
 = = = Town marshal shot = = = 
 On October 28 , 1880 , popular Tombstone town marshal Fred White attempted to break up a group of five late @-@ night , drunken revelers shooting at the moon on Allen Street in Tombstone . Deputy Sheriff Wyatt was in Owens Saloon a block away , though unarmed . When he heard the shooting , he ran to the scene , borrowed a pistol from Fred Dodge and went to assist White . He saw White attempt to disarm Curly Bill Brocius and the gun discharge , striking White in the groin . Wyatt pistol @-@ whipped Brocius , knocking him to the ground . Then he grabbed Brocius by the collar and told him to get up . Brocius protested , asking , " What have I done ? " 
 Fred Dodge arrived on the scene . In a letter to Stuart Lake many years later , he recalled what he saw . 
 Wyatt 's coolness and nerve never showed to better advantage than they did that night . When <unk> and I reached him , Wyatt was squatted on his heels beside Curly Bill and Fred White . Curly Bill 's friends were pot @-@ shooting at him in the dark . The shooting was lively and slugs were hitting the chimney and cabin ... in all of that racket , Wyatt 's voice was even and quiet as usual . 
 Wyatt altered his story later on , telling John H. Flood that he did not see Brocius 's pistol on the ground in the dark until afterward . The pistol contained one expended cartridge and five live rounds . Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court . Virgil and Wyatt escorted Brocius to Tucson to stand trial , possibly saving him from a lynching . White , age 31 , died of his wound two days after his shooting . 
 On December 27 , 1880 , Wyatt testified that White 's shooting was accidental . Brocius expressed regret , saying he had not intended to shoot White . Gunsmith Jacob Gruber testified that Curly Bill 's single @-@ action revolver was defective , allowing it to be discharged at half @-@ cock . A statement from White before he died was introduced stating that the shooting was accidental . The judge ruled that the shooting was accidental and released Brocius . Brocius , however , remained intensely angry about how Wyatt had pistol @-@ whipped him and became an enemy to the Earps . Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone . 
 = = = Loses reappointment = = = 
 Wyatt only served as deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County for about three months because , in November , Democrat Shibell ran for re @-@ election against Republican challenger Bob Paul . The region was strongly Republican and Paul was expected to win . Republican Wyatt expected he would continue in the job . Given how fast eastern Pima County was growing , everyone expected that it would be split off into its own county soon with Tombstone as its seat . Wyatt hoped to win the job as the new county sheriff and continue receiving the plum 10 % of all tax moneys collected . Southern Pacific was the major landholder , so that tax collection was a relatively easy process . 
 On election day , November 2 , Precinct 27 in the San Simon Valley in northern Cochise County , turned out 104 votes , 103 of them for Shibell . Shibell unexpectedly won the election by a margin of 58 votes under suspicious circumstances . 
 James C. Hancock reported that Cowboys Curly Bill Brocius and Johnny Ringo served as election officials in the San Simon precinct . However , on November 1 , the day before the election , Ringo biographer David Johnson places Ringo in New Mexico with Ike Clanton . Curly Bill had been arrested and jailed in Tucson on October 28 for shooting Sheriff Fred White , and he was still there on election day . 
 The home of John Magill was used as the polling place . The precinct only contained about 10 eligible voters ( another source says 50 ) , but the Cowboys gathered non @-@ voters like the children and Chinese and had them cast ballots . Not satisfied , they named all the dogs , burros and poultry and cast ballots in their names for Shibell . The election board met on November 14 and declared Shibell as the winner . 
 Earp resigned from the Sheriff 's office on November 9 , 1880 , and Shibell immediately appointed Behan as the new Deputy Sheriff for eastern Pima County . Democrat Johnny Behan had considerably more political experience than Republican Wyatt Earp . Behan had previously served as Yavapai County Sheriff from 1871 to 1873 . He had been elected to the Arizona Territorial Legislature twice , representing Yavapai Country in the 7th Territorial Legislature in 1873 and Mohave County in the 10th in 1879 . Behan moved for a time to the northwest Arizona Territory , where he served as the Mohave County Recorder in 1877 and then deputy sheriff of Mohave County at Gillet , in 1879 . 
 Paul filed a lawsuit on November 19 contesting the election results , alleging that Shibell 's Cowboy supporters <unk> Clanton , Curly Bill Brocius , and Frank McLaury had cooperated in ballot stuffing . Chief Justice of Arizona <unk> French ruled in Paul 's favor in late January 1881 , but Shibell appealed . His lawsuit was finally resolved by April 1881 . The election commission found that a mysterious " Henry Johnson " was responsible for certifying the ballots . This turned out to be James Johnson , the same James K. Johnson who had been shooting up Allen Street the night Marshal White was killed . Moreover , he was the same Johnson that testified at Curly Bill 's preliminary hearing after he shot Fred White . James Johnson later testified for Bud Paul in the election hearing and said that the ballots had been left in the care of Phin Clanton . None of the witnesses during the election hearing reported on ballots being cast for dogs . The recount found Paul had 402 votes and Shibell had 354 . Sixty @-@ two were kept from a closer examination . Paul was declared the winner of the Pima County sheriff election but by that time the election was a moot point . Paul could not replace Behan with Earp because on January 1 , 1881 , Cochise County was created out of the eastern portion of Pima County . 
 = = = Behan wins election = = = 
 Earp and Behan both applied to fill the new position of Cochise County sheriff , which like the Pima County Sheriff job paid the office holder 10 % of the fees and taxes collected . Earp thought he had a good chance to win the position because he was the former undersheriff in the region and a Republican , like Arizona Territorial Governor John C. Fremont . However , Behan had greater political experience and influence in Prescott . 
 Earp improbably testified during the preliminary hearing after the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral that he and Behan had made a deal . If Earp withdrew his application to the legislature , Behan agreed to appoint Earp as undersheriff . Behan received the appointment in February 1881 , but did not keep his end of the bargain and instead chose Harry Woods , a prominent Democrat , as undersheriff . Behan testified at first that he had not made any deal with Earp , although he later admitted he had lied . Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident that occurred shortly before his appointment . 
 This incident arose after Earp learned that one of his prize horses , stolen more than a year before , was in the possession of Ike Clanton and his brother Billy . Earp and Holliday rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse . On the way , they overtook Behan , who was riding in a wagon . Behan was also heading to the ranch to serve an election @-@ hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton . Accounts differ as to what happened next . Earp later testified that when he arrived at the Clanton ranch , Billy Clanton gave up the horse even before being presented with ownership papers . According to Behan 's testimony , however , Earp had told the Clantons that Behan was on his way to arrest them for horse theft . After the incident , which embarrassed both the Clantons and Behan , Behan testified that he did not want to work with Earp and chose Woods instead . 
 = = = Relationship to Sadie Marcus = = = 
 Thirty @-@ two @-@ year @-@ old Wyatt Earp and 35 @-@ year @-@ old Johnny Behan apparently shared an interest in the same 18 @-@ year @-@ old woman , Josephine Sarah Marcus . She said she first visited Tombstone as part of the Pauline Markham Theatre Troupe on December 1 , 1879 for a one @-@ week engagement but modern researchers have not found any record that she was ever part of the theater company . Behan owned a saloon in Tip Top , Arizona , where he maintained a prostitute named Sadie Mansfield . In September 1880 , Behan moved to Tombstone . Sadie may have returned to San Francisco and then joined Behan in Tombstone , where she and Behan continued their relationship . Sadie was a well @-@ known nickname for Sarah , and it was common for prostitutes to change their first name . Wyatt had a mischievous sense of humor . When they became a couple in 1882 , he knew his wife preferred the name " Josephine " and detested " Sadie " , but early in their relationship he began calling her ' Sadie ' . 
 Sadie Mansfield and Sadie Marcus had very similar names and initials and were both known by their friends as " Sadie . " Both made a stagecoach journey from San Francisco to Prescott , Arizona Territory ; both traveled with a black woman named Julia ; both were sexual partners with Behan ; both were 19 years old , born in New York City , and had parents from Prussia . The only difference noted in the 1880 census is their occupation : Sadie in San Francisco is listed as " At home " , while Sadie in Tip Top is recorded as a " Courtesan " . But Josephine said that her parents hid her activities , and they may have been covering for her when the census taker , a neighbor who knew the family , appeared on their doorstep . 
 In spring 1881 , Marcus found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend and kicked him out , although she still used the Behan surname through the end of that summer . Earp had a common @-@ law relationship with Mattie Blaylock , who was listed as his wife in the June 1880 census . She suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum , a commonly used opiate and painkiller . There are no contemporary records in Tombstone of a relationship between Josephine and Earp . Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Wyatt and Josephine together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs . But Earp and Marcus certainly knew each other , as Behan and Earp both had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon . 
 A letter written by former New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero in 1940 appears to indicate that Earp had strong feelings for Josephine in April 1882 . After leaving Tombstone following the Earp Vendetta Ride , the Earp posse went to Albuquerque , New Mexico for two weeks . While there , Wyatt stayed with prominent businessman Henry N. Jaffa , who was also president of New Albuquerque ’ s Board of Trade . Like Josephine , Jaffa was Jewish . 
 Wyatt and Holliday had been fast friends since Holliday saved Earp 's life in Dodge City during 1878 . During their stay in Albuquerque , the two men ate at The Retreat Restaurant owned by " Fat Charlie " . Ortero wrote in his letter , " Holiday said something about Earp becoming ' a damn Jew @-@ boy . ' Earp became angry and left … . [ Henry ] Jaffa told me later that Earp ’ s woman was a Jewess . Earp did mezuzah when entering the house . " The Earp party split up in Albuquerque , and Holliday and Dan Tipton rode on to Pueblo , Colorado while the rest of the group headed for Gunnison . Earp 's anger at Holliday 's racial slur may indicate that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known . The information in the letter is compelling because at that time in the 1940s , the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge . Ortero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved . 
 Marcus went to great lengths to sanitize her own and Wyatt 's history . For example , she worked hard to keep both her name and the name of Wyatt 's second wife Mattie out of Stuart Lake 's 1931 book , Wyatt Earp : Frontier Marshal , and Marcus threatened litigation to keep it that way . Marcus also told Earp 's biographers and others that Earp never drank , did not own gambling saloons , and that he never provided prostitutes to customers , although strong evidence to the contrary exists . 
 = = = Interest in mining and gambling = = = 
 Losing the undersheriff position left Wyatt Earp without a job in Tombstone ; however , Wyatt and his brothers were beginning to make some money on their mining claims in the Tombstone area . In January 1881 , Oriental Saloon owner Mike Joyce gave Wyatt Earp a one @-@ quarter interest in the faro concession at the Oriental Saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer . Gambling was regarded as a legitimate profession , comparable to a doctor or member of clergy , at the time . Wyatt invited his friend , lawman and gambler Bat Masterson , to Tombstone to help him run the faro tables in the Oriental Saloon . In June 1881 , Wyatt also telegraphed another friend and gambler from Dodge , Luke Short , who was living in Leadville , Colorado , and offered him a job as a faro dealer . 
 Bat remained until April 1881 , when he returned to Dodge City to assist his brother Jim . On October 8 , 1881 , Doc Holliday got into a dispute with John Tyler in the Oriental Saloon . A rival gambling concession operator hired and disrupt Wyatt 's business . When Tyler started a fight after losing a bet , Wyatt threw him out of the saloon . Holliday later wounded Oriental owners Milt Joyce and his partner William Parker and was convicted of assault .

 Stuart Lake described in his book how Earp single @-@ handedly stood down a large crowd that wanted to lynch gambler Michael O 'Rourke ( Johnny Behind the Deuce ) . O 'Rourke had killed Henry Schneider , chief engineer of the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company — he said in self @-@ defense . Henry was well @-@ liked and a mob of miners quickly gathered , threatening to lynch O 'Rourke on the spot . In fact , the Epitaph gave primary credit to Ben Sippy for standing down the crowd , assisted by Virgil Earp , Wyatt Earp , and Johnny Behan . This incident as described by Lake added to Earp 's modern legend as a lawman .

 Tensions between the Earps and both the Clantons and McLaurys increased through 1881 . On March 15 , 1881 , at 10 p.m. , three cowboys attempted to rob a Kinnear & Company stagecoach reportedly carrying US $ 26 @,@ 000 in silver bullion ( or about $ 637 @,@ 538 in today 's dollars ) . The amount of bullion actually carried has been questioned by modern researchers , who note that at the then current value of US $ 1 @.@ 00 per ounce , the bullion would have weighed about 1 @,@ 600 pounds ( 730 kg ) , a significant weight for a team of horses . The hold up took place near Benson , during which the robbers killed popular driver Eli " Budd " Philpot and passenger Peter Roerig . 
 The Earps and a posse tracked the men down and arrested Luther King , who confessed he had been holding the reins while Bill Leonard , Harry " The Kid " Head , and Jim Crain robbed the stage . They arrested King and Sheriff Johnny Behan escorted him to jail , but somehow King walked in the front door and almost immediately out the back door . 
 During the hearing into the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral , Wyatt testified that he offered the US $ 3 @,@ 600 in Wells Fargo reward money ( $ 1 @,@ 200 per robber ) to Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury in return for information about the identities of the three robbers . Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan as well : he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff . Wyatt told the court that he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive . 
 According to testimony given by Wyatt and Virgil , both Frank McLaury and Ike Clanton agreed to provide information to assist in capturing Leonard , Head , and Crain , but they never had a chance to fulfill the agreement . All three suspects were killed when attempting other robberies . 
 In his testimony at the court hearing , Clanton said Wyatt did not want to capture the men , but to kill them . Clanton told the court that Earp wanted to conceal the Earp family 's involvement in the Benson stage robbery . He said Wyatt swore him to secrecy and the next day Morgan Earp asked him whether he would make the agreement with Wyatt . He said that four or five days afterward Morgan had confided in him that he and Wyatt had " piped off $ 1 @,@ 400 to Doc Holliday and Bill Leonard " who were supposed to be on the stage the night Bud Philpot was killed . During his testimony , Clanton told the court , " I was not going to have anything to do with helping to capture — " and then he corrected himself " — kill Bill Leonard , Crane and Harry Head " . Clanton denied having any knowledge of the Wells Fargo telegram confirming the reward money .

 Meanwhile , tensions between the Earps and the McLaurys increased when Cowboys robbed the passenger stage on the Sandy Bob Line in the Tombstone area on September 8 , bound for nearby Bisbee . The masked robbers shook down the passengers and robbed the strongbox . They were recognized by their voices and language . They were identified as Deputy Sheriff Pete Spence ( an alias for Elliot Larkin Ferguson ) and Deputy Sheriff Frank Stilwell , a business partner of Spence . Stilwell was fired a short while later as a Deputy Sheriff for Sheriff Behan ( for county tax " accounting irregularities " ) . 
 Wyatt and Virgil Earp rode with the sheriff 's posse attempting to track the stage robbers . Wyatt discovered an unusual boot heel print in the mud . The posse checked with a shoemaker in Bisbee and found a matching heel that he had just removed from Stilwell 's boot . A further check of a Bisbee corral turned up both Spence and Stilwell who were arrested by sheriff 's deputies Billy Breakenridge and Nagel . 
 Spence and Stilwell were arraigned on the robbery charges before Justice Wells Spicer who set their bail at $ 7 @,@ 000 each . They were released after paying their bail , but Spence and Stilwell were re @-@ arrested by Virgil for the Bisbee robbery a month later , on October 13 , on the new federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier . The newspapers , however , reported that they had been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred ( October 8 ) near Contention City . Occurring less than two weeks before the O.K. Corral shootout , this final incident may have been misunderstood by the McLaurys . While Wyatt and Virgil were still out of town for the Spence and Stilwell hearing , Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp , telling him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence , Stilwell , or the McLaurys again . 
 = = Gunfight on Fremont Street = = 
 On Wednesday , October 26 , 1881 , the tension between the Earps and the Cowboys came to a head . Ike Clanton , Billy Claiborne , and other Cowboys had been threatening to kill the Earps for several weeks . Tombstone city Marshal Virgil Earp learned that the Cowboys were armed and had gathered near the O.K. Corral . He asked Wyatt and Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday to assist him , as he intended to disarm them . Wyatt was acting as a temporary assistant marshal , Morgan was a Deputy City Marshal , and Virgil deputized Holliday for the occasion . At approximately 3 p.m. the Earps headed towards Fremont Street , where the Cowboys had been reported gathering . 
 They confronted five Cowboys in a vacant lot adjacent to the O.K. Corral 's rear entrance on Fremont Street . The lot between the Harwood House and Fly 's Boarding House and Photography Studio was narrow — the two parties were initially only about 6 to 10 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 0 m ) apart . Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne fled the gunfight . Tom and Frank McLaury along with Billy Clanton stood their ground and were killed . Morgan was clipped by a shot across his back that nicked both shoulder blades and a vertebra . Virgil was shot through the calf and Holliday was grazed by a bullet . 
 = = Charged with murder = = 
 On October 30 , as permitted by Territorial law , Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday . Justice Wells Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial . In an unusual proceeding , he took written and oral testimony from a number of witnesses over more than a month . 
 Sheriff Behan , testifying for the prosecution , said the Cowboys had not resisted but either thrown up their hands and turned out their coats to show they were not armed . He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat to show that he was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party . Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a nickel @-@ plated revolver , although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand . 
 The Earps hired an experienced trial lawyer , Thomas Fitch , as defense counsel . Wyatt testified that he drew his gun only after Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury went for their pistols . He detailed the Earps ' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys and explained that they intended to disarm the cowboys . He said they fired in self @-@ defense . Fitch managed to produce testimony from prosecution witnesses during cross @-@ examination that was contradictory , or appeared to dodge his questions , or in which they said they could not remember . 
 After extensive testimony , Justice Spicer ruled on November 30 that there was not enough evidence to indict the men . He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been deputized temporarily by Virgil . Even though the Earps and Holliday were free , their reputations had been tarnished . The Cowboys in Tombstone looked upon the Earps as robbers and murderers and plotted revenge .

 On December 28 , while walking between saloons on Allen Street in Tombstone , Virgil was ambushed and maimed by a shotgun round that struck his left arm and shoulder . Ike Clanton 's hat was found in the back of the building across Allen Street from where the shots were fired . Wyatt wired U.S. Marshal Crawley P. Dake asking to be appointed deputy U.S. marshal with authority to select his own deputies . Dake granted the request in late January and provided the Earps with some funds he borrowed from Wells Fargo | Wells , Fargo & Co. on behalf of the Earps , variously reported as $ 500 to $ 3 @,@ 000 . 
 In mid @-@ January , when Earp ally <unk> sold the Oriental Saloon to Earp adversary Milt Joyce , Wyatt sold his gambling concessions at the hotel . The Earps also raised some funds from sympathetic business owners in town . On February 2 , 1882 , Wyatt and Virgil , tired of the criticism leveled against them , submitted their resignations to Dake , who refused to accept them because their accounts had not been settled . On the same day , Wyatt sent a message to Ike Clanton that he wanted to reconcile their differences , which Clanton refused . Clanton was also acquitted that day of the charges against him in the shooting of Virgil Earp , when the defense brought in seven witnesses who testified that Clanton was in Charleston at the time of the shooting . 
 The Earps needed more funds to pay for the extra deputies and associated expenses . Contributions received from supportive business owners were not enough . On February 13 , Wyatt mortgaged his home to lawyer James G. Howard for $ 365 @.@ 00 ( about $ 8 @,@ 950 today ) and received $ 365 @.@ 00 in U.S. gold coin . ( He was never able to repay the loan and in 1884 Howard foreclosed on the house . ) 
 After attending a theatre show on March 18 , Morgan Earp was assassinated by gunmen firing from a dark alley through a door window into a room where he was playing billiards . Morgan was struck in the right side . The bullet shattered his spine , passed through his left side , and lodged in the thigh of George A. B. Berry . Another round narrowly missed Wyatt . A doctor was summoned and Morgan was moved from the floor to a nearby couch . The assassins escaped in the dark and Morgan died forty minutes later . 
 Wyatt Earp felt he could not rely on civil justice and decided to take matters into his own hands . He concluded that the only way to deal with Morgan 's assassins was to kill them all . 
 = = Earp vendetta ride = = 
 The day after Morgan 's assassination , Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp formed a posse made up of his brothers James and Warren , Doc Holliday , Sherman McMaster , Jack " Turkey Creek " Johnson , Charles " Hairlip Charlie " Smith , Daniel " Tip " Tipton , and John Wilson " Texas Jack " Vermillion to protect the family and pursue the suspects , paying them $ 5 @.@ 00 a day . They took Morgan 's body to the railhead in Benson . James was to accompany Morgan 's body to the family home in Colton , California , where Morgan 's parents and wife waited to bury him . The posse guarded Virgil and Addie through to Tucson , where they had heard Frank Stilwell and other Cowboys were waiting to kill Virgil . The next morning Frank Stilwell 's body was found alongside the tracks riddled with buckshot and gunshot wounds . Wyatt and five other federal lawmen were indicted for murdering him and Tucson Justice of the Peace Charles Meyer issued warrants for their arrest . 
 The Earp posse briefly returned to Tombstone , where Sheriff Behan tried to stop them . The heavily armed posse brushed him aside . Hairlip Charlie and Warren remained in Tombstone , and the rest set out for Pete Spence 's wood camp in the Dragoon Mountains . They found and killed Florentino " Indian Charlie " Cruz . Two days later , near Iron Springs ( later <unk> Springs ) , in the Whetstone Mountains , they were seeking to rendezvous with a messenger for them . They unexpectedly stumbled onto the wood camp of Curly Bill Brocius , Pony Diehl , and other Outlaw Cowboys . According to reports from both sides , the two sides immediately exchanged gun fire . Except for Wyatt and Texas Jack Vermillion , whose horse was shot , the Earp party withdrew to find protection from the heavy gunfire . Curly Bill fired at Wyatt with a shotgun but missed . Eighteen months prior Wyatt had protected Curly Bill against a mob ready to lynch him and then provided testimony that helped spare Curly Bill from a murder trial for killing Sheriff Fred White . Now , Wyatt returned Curly Bill 's gunfire with his own shotgun and shot Curly Bill in the chest from about 50 feet ( 15m ) away . Curly Bill fell into the water by the edge of the spring and died . 
 Wyatt received bullet holes in both sides of his long coat and another struck his boot heel . After emptying his shotgun , Wyatt fired his pistol , mortally wounding Johnny Barnes in the chest and wounded Milt Hicks in the arm . Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse , exposing himself to the Cowboys ' gunfire . Doc Holliday helped him get to cover . Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs . He was finally able to get on his horse and with the rest of the posse retreated . 
 The Earp Party rode north to the Percy Ranch , but were not welcomed by Hugh and Jim Percy , who feared the Cowboys ; after a meal and some rest , they left at about 3 : 00 in the morning of March 27 . The Earp party slipped into the area near Tombstone and met with supporters , including " Hairlip Charlie " Smith and Warren Earp . On March 27 , the posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch owned by Henry Hooker , a wealthy and prominent rancher . That night Dan Tipton caught the first stage out of Tombstone and headed for Benson , carrying $ 1 @,@ 000 from mining owner and Earp supporter E. B. Gage for the posse . Hooker congratulated Earp on the killing of Curly Bill . Hooker fed them and Wyatt told him he wanted to buy new mounts . Hooker was known for his purebred stallions and ran over 500 brood mares that produced horses that became known for their speed , beauty and temperament . He provided Wyatt and his posse with new mounts but refused to take Wyatt 's money . When Behan 's posse was observed in the distance , Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there , but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles ( 5 km ) distant near Reilly Hill . 
 The federal posse led by Wyatt Earp was not found by the local posse , led by Cochise County Sheriff John Behan , although Behan 's party trailed the Earps for many miles . In the middle of April 1882 the Earp party left the Arizona Territory and headed east into New Mexico Territory and then into Colorado .
