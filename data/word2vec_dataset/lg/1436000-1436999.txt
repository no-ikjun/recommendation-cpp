 = Psilocybe semilanceata = 
 Psilocybe semilanceata , commonly known as the liberty cap , is a psychedelic ( or " magic " ) mushroom that contains the psychoactive compounds psilocybin , baeocystin and phenylethylamine . Of the world 's psilocybin mushrooms , it is both one of the most widely distributed in nature , and one of the most potent . The mushrooms have a distinctive conical to bell @-@ shaped cap , up to 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 0 in ) in diameter , with a small nipple @-@ like protrusion on the top . They are yellow to brown , covered with radial grooves when moist , and fade to a lighter color as they mature . Their stipes tend to be slender and long , and the same color or slightly lighter than the cap . The gill attachment to the stipe is adnexed ( narrowly attached ) , and they are initially cream @-@ colored before tinting purple as the spores mature . The spores are dark purplish @-@ brown in mass , ellipsoid in shape , and measure 10 @.@ 5 – 15 by 6 @.@ 5 – 8 @.@ 5 micrometres . 
 The mushroom grows in grassland habitats , especially wetter areas . But unlike P. cubensis , the fungus does not grow directly on dung ; rather , it is a saprobic species that feeds off decaying grass roots . It is widely distributed in the temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere , particularly in Europe , and has been reported occasionally in temperate areas of the Southern Hemisphere as well . The earliest reliable history of P. semilanceata intoxication dates back to 1799 in London , and in the 1960s the mushroom was the first European species confirmed to contain psilocybin . 
 The possession or sale of psilocybin mushrooms is illegal in many countries . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The species was first described by Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus semilanceatus in his 1838 Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici . Paul Kummer transferred it to Psilocybe in 1871 when he raised many of Fries 's sub @-@ groupings of Agaricus to the level of genus . Panaeolus semilanceatus , named by Jakob Emanuel Lange in both 1936 and 1939 publications , is a synonym . According to the taxonomical database MycoBank , several taxa once considered varieties of P. semilanceata are synonymous with the species now known as Psilocybe <unk> : the caerulescens variety described by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1887 ( originally named Agaricus semilanceatus var. <unk> by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in 1881 ) , the microspora variety described by Rolf Singer in 1969 , and the <unk> variety described by Marcel Bon in 1985 . 
 Several molecular studies published in the 2000s demonstrated that Psilocybe , as it was defined then , was polyphyletic . The studies supported the idea of dividing the genus into two clades , one consisting of the bluing , hallucinogenic species in the family Hymenogastraceae , and the other the non @-@ bluing , non @-@ hallucinogenic species in the family Strophariaceae . However , the generally accepted lectotype ( a specimen later selected when the original author of a taxon name did not designate a type ) of the genus as a whole was Psilocybe montana , which is a non @-@ bluing , non @-@ hallucinogenic species . If the non @-@ bluing , non @-@ hallucinogenic species in the study were to be segregated , it would have left the hallucinogenic clade without a valid name . To resolve this dilemma , several mycologists proposed in a 2005 publication to conserve the name Psilocybe , with P. semilanceata as the type . As they explained , conserving the name Psilocybe in this way would prevent nomenclatural changes to a well @-@ known group of fungi , many species of which are " linked to archaeology , anthropology , religion , alternate life styles , forensic science , law enforcement , laws and regulation " . Further , the name P. semilanceata had historically been accepted as the lectotype by many authors in the period 1938 – 68 . The proposal to conserve the name Psilocybe , with P. semilanceata as the type was accepted unanimously by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi in 2009 . 
 The mushroom takes its common name from the Phrygian cap , also known as the " liberty cap " , which it resembles ; P. semilanceata shares its common name with P. pelliculosa , a species from which it is more or less indistinguishable in appearance . The Latin word for Phrygian cap is pileus , nowadays the technical name for what is commonly known as the " cap " of a fungal fruit body . In the 18th century Phrygian caps were placed on Liberty poles , which resemble the stipe of the mushroom . The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) ( " smooth " or " bare " ) and the Byzantine Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) ( " head " ) . The specific epithet comes from the Latin semi ( " half " ) and <unk> , from lanceolatus , meaning " spear @-@ shaped " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of P. semilanceata is 5 – 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 0 in ) in diameter and 6 – 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 – 0 @.@ 87 in ) tall . It varies in shape from sharply conical to bell @-@ shaped , often with a prominent papilla ( a nipple @-@ shaped structure ) , and does not change shape considerably as it ages . The cap margin is initially rolled inward but unrolls to become straight or even curled upwards in maturity . The cap is hygrophanous , meaning it assumes different colors depending on its state of hydration . When it is moist , the cap is ochraceous to pale brown to dark chestnut brown , but darker in the center , often with a greenish @-@ blue tinge . When moist , radial grooves ( striations ) can be seen on the cap that correspond to the positions of the gills underneath . When the cap is dry , it becomes much paler , a light yellow @-@ brown color . Moist mushrooms have sticky surfaces that result from a thin gelatinous film called a pellicle . This film becomes apparent if a piece of the cap is broken by bending it back and peeling away the piece . When the cap dries from exposure to the sun , the film turns whitish and is no longer <unk> . 
 On the underside of the mushroom 's cap , there are between 15 and 27 individual narrow gills that are moderately crowded together , and they have a narrowly adnexed to almost free attachment to the stipe . Their color is initially pale brown , but becomes dark gray to purple @-@ brown with a lighter edge as the spores mature . The slender yellowish @-@ brown stipe is 45 – 140 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) long by 1 – 3 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 04 – 0 @.@ 14 in ) thick , and usually slightly thicker towards the base . The mushroom has a thin cobweb @-@ like partial veil that does not last long before disappearing ; sometimes , the partial veil leaves an annular zone on the stipe that may be darkened by spores . The flesh is thin and membrane @-@ like , and roughly the same color as the surface tissue . It has a farinaceous ( similar to freshly ground flour ) odor and taste . All parts of the mushroom will stain a bluish color if handled or bruised , and it may naturally turn blue with age . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 In deposit , the spores are a deep reddish purple @-@ brown color . The use of a light microscope can reveal further details : the spores are oblong when seen in side view , and oblong to oval in frontal view , with dimensions of 10 @.@ 5 – 15 by 6 @.@ 5 – 8 @.@ 5 μm . The basidia ( spore bearing cells of the hymenium ) , are 20 – 31 by 5 – 9 μm , four @-@ spored , and have clamps at their bases ; there are no basidia found on the sterile gill edge . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) measure 15 – 30 by 4 – 7 μm , and are flask @-@ shaped with long thin necks that are 1 – 3 @.@ 5 μm wide . P. semilanceata does not have pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) . The cap cuticle is up to 90 μm thick , and is made of a tissue layer called an ixocutis — a gelatinized layer of hyphae lying parallel to the cap surface . The hyphae comprising the ixocutis are cylindrical , hyaline , and 1 – 3 @.@ 5 μm wide . Immediately under the cap cuticle is the subpellis , made of hyphae that are 4 – 12 μm wide with yellowish @-@ brown encrusted walls . There are clamp connections present in the hyphae of all tissues . 
 = = = Other forms = = = 
 The anamorphic form of P. semilanceata is an asexual stage in the fungus 's life cycle involved in the development of mitotic <unk> ( conidia ) . In culture , grown in a petri dish , the fungus forms a white to pale orange cottony or felt @-@ like mat of mycelia . The conidia formed are straight to curved , measuring 2 @.@ 0 – 8 @.@ 0 by 1 @.@ 1 – 2 @.@ 0 μm , and may contain one to several small intracellular droplets . Although little is known of the anamorphic stage of P. semilanceata beyond the confines of laboratory culture , in general , the morphology of the asexual structures may be used as classical characters in phylogenetic analyses to help understand the evolutionary relationships between related groups of fungi . 
 Scottish mycologist Roy Watling described <unk> ( truffle @-@ like ) or secotioid versions of P. semilanceata he found growing in association with regular fruit bodies . These versions had elongated caps , 20 – 22 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 – 8 @.@ 7 in ) long and 0 @.@ 8 – 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) wide at the base , with the inward curved margins closely hugging the stipe from the development of membranous flanges . Their gills were narrow , closely crowded together , and anastomosed ( fused together in a vein @-@ like network ) . The color of the gills was sepia with a brownish vinaceous ( red wine @-@ colored ) cast , and a white margin . The stipes of the fruit bodies were 5 – 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) long by 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 04 – 0 @.@ 12 in ) thick , with about 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) of stipe length covered by the extended cap . The thick @-@ walled ellipsoid spores were 12 @.@ 5 – 13 @.@ 5 by 6 @.@ 5 – 7 μm . Despite the significant differences in morphology , molecular analysis showed the secotioid version to be the same species as the typical morphotype . 
 = = Similar species = = 
 There are several other Psilocybe species that may be confused with P. semilanceata due to similarities in physical appearance . P. <unk> is a slender grassland species that is differentiated macroscopically from P. semilanceata by the lack of a prominent papilla . P. mexicana , commonly known as the " Mexican liberty cap " , is also similar in appearance , but is found in manure @-@ rich soil in subtropical grasslands in Mexico . It has somewhat smaller spores than P. semilanceata , typically 8 – 9 @.@ 9 by 5 @.@ 5 – 7 @.@ 7 μm . Another lookalike species is P. <unk> , found in Thailand , where it grows in well @-@ <unk> clay @-@ like soils or among paddy fields . This mushroom can be distinguished from P. semilanceata by its smaller cap , up to 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) in diameter , and its rhomboid @-@ shaped spores . P. pelliculosa is physically similar to such a degree that it may be indistinguishable in the field . It differs from P. semilanceata by virtue of its smaller spores , measuring 9 – 13 by 5 – 7 μm . 
 The toxic species Cortinarius rubellus ( formerly known as C. <unk> ) has been confused with P. semilanceata by novice collectors looking to consume the mushrooms for hallucinogenic effects , sometimes with drastic consequences . The expanded and bluntly umbonate cap of C. rubellus is orange @-@ brown with a larger diameter than P. semilanceata , typically ranging from 2 – 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) . The gills are adnate to sinuate in attachment to the stipe , and cinnamon @-@ brown in color ( rather than dark gray to purple @-@ brown ) . Its stipe is roughly the same color as the cap , 5 – 8 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) long and much thicker than P. semilanceata — usually 0 @.@ 6 – 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) , and sometimes bears lemon @-@ yellow bands . It is a mycorrhizal species that grows on acidic soil among mosses , usually in wet coniferous forests . P. semilanceata has also been confused with the toxic muscarine @-@ containing species Inocybe <unk> , a whitish mushroom with a silky cap , yellowish @-@ brown to pale grayish gills , and a dull yellowish @-@ brown spore print . 
 = = Ecology and habitat = = 
 Psilocybe semilanceata fruits solitarily or in groups on rich and acidic soil , typically in grasslands , such as meadows , pastures , or lawns . It is often found in pastures that have been fertilized with sheep or cow dung , although it does not typically grow directly on the dung . 
 Like some other grassland psilocybin mushroom species such as P. mexicana , P. tampanensis and Conocybe <unk> , P. semilanceata may form sclerotia , a dormant form of the fungus , which affords it some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters . The German mycologist Jochen Gartz even succeeded in producing sclerotia on a malt agar surface culture . 
 P. semilanceata , like all others species of the genus Psilocybe , is a saprobic fungus , meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter . The mushroom is also associated with sedges in moist areas of fields , and it is thought to live on the decaying root remains . 
 Laboratory tests have shown P. semilanceata to suppress the growth of the soil @-@ borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi , a virulent plant pathogen that causes the disease root rot . When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of grasses from its habitat , P. semilanceata significantly suppresses their growth . This antifungal activity , which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes , helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter . Using standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests , Psilocybe semilanceata was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the human pathogen methicillin @-@ resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) . The source of the antimicrobial activity is unknown . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Psilocybe authority Gastón Guzmán , in his 1983 monograph on psilocybin mushrooms , considered Psilocybe semilanceata the world 's most widespread psilocybin mushroom species , as it has been reported on 17 countries . In Europe , P. semilanceata has a widespread distribution , and is found in Austria , Belgium , Bulgaria , the Channel Islands , Czech republic , Denmark , Estonia , the Faroe Islands , Finland , France , Georgia , Germany , Hungary , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , the Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Russia , Slovakia , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and the United Kingdom . It is generally agreed that the species is native to Europe ; Watling has demonstrated that there exists little difference between specimens collected from Spain and Scotland , at both the morphological and genetic level . 
 The mushroom also has a widespread distribution in North America . In Canada it has been collected from British Columbia , New Brunswick , Newfoundland , Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island and Quebec . In the United States , it is most common in the Pacific Northwest , west of the Cascade Mountains , where it fruits abundantly in autumn and early winter ; fruiting has also been reported to occur infrequently during spring months . Charles Horton Peck reported the mushroom to occur in New York in the early 20th century , and consequently , much literature published since then has reported the species to be present in the eastern United States . Gaston Guzman later examined Peck 's herbarium specimen , and in his comprehensive 1983 monograph on Psilocybe , concluded that Peck had misidentified it with the species now known as <unk> <unk> . P. semilanceata is much less common in South America , where it has been recorded in Chile . It is also known in Australia ( where it may be an introduced species ) and New Zealand , where it grows in high @-@ altitude grasslands . In 2000 , it was reported from <unk> , in the Indian state of Assam . 
 = = Psychoactive use = = 
 The first reliably documented report of Psilocybe semilanceata intoxication involved a British family in 1799 , who prepared a meal with mushrooms they had picked in London 's Green Park . According to the chemist Augustus Everard Brande , the father and his four children experienced typical symptoms associated with ingestion , including pupil dilation , spontaneous laughter and delirium . The identification of the species responsible was made possible by James Sowerby 's 1803 book Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms , which included a description of the fungus , then known as Agaricus glutinosus ( originally described by Moses Ashley Curtis in 1780 ) . According to German mycologist Jochen Gartz , the description of the species is " fully compatible with current knowledge about Psilocybe semilanceata . " 
 In the early 1960s , the Swiss scientist Albert Hofmann — known for the synthesis of the psychedelic drug LSD — chemically analyzed P. semilanceata fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist Roger Heim . Using the technique of paper chromatography , Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0 @.@ 25 % ( by weight ) psilocybin in dried samples . Their 1963 publication was the first report of psilocybin in a European mushroom species ; previously , it had been known only in Psilocybe species native to Mexico , Asia and North America . This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England , Czechoslovakia ( 1973 ) , Germany ( 1977 ) , Norway ( 1978 ) , and Belgium and Finland ( 1984 ) . In 1965 , forensic characterization of psilocybin @-@ containing mushrooms seized from college students in British Columbia identified P. semilanceata — the first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada . The presence of the psilocybin analog baeocystin was confirmed in 1977 . Several studies published since then support the idea that the variability of psilocybin content in P. semilanceata is low , regardless of country of origin . 
 = = = Properties = = = 
 Several studies have quantified the amounts of hallucinogenic compounds found in the fruit bodies of Psilocybe semilanceata . In 1993 , Gartz reported an average of 1 % psilocybin ( expressed as a percentage of the dry weight of the fruit bodies ) , ranging from a minimum of 0 @.@ 2 % to a maximum of 2 @.@ 37 % , which is the highest psilocybin concentration reported for a mushroom . In an earlier analysis , <unk> <unk> and Thom Kuyper ( 1985 ) found a high concentration in a single specimen ( 1 @.@ 7 % ) in addition to a relatively high concentration of baeocystin ( 0 @.@ 36 % ) . Smaller specimens tend to have the highest percent concentrations of psilocybin , but the absolute amount is highest in larger mushrooms . A Finnish study assayed psilocybin concentrations in old herbarium specimens , and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time , it was relatively stable . They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old . Michael Beug and Jeremy <unk> , analyzing specimens from the Pacific Northwest region of the United States , reported psilocybin concentrations ranging from 0 @.@ 62 % to 1 @.@ 28 % , averaging 1 @.@ 0 ± 0 @.@ 2 % . They concluded that the species was one of the most potent , as well as the most constant in psilocybin levels . In a 1996 publication , Paul Stamets defined a " potency rating scale " based on the total content of psychoactive compounds ( including psilocybin , psilocin , and baeocystin ) in 12 species of Psilocybe mushrooms . Although there are certain caveats with this technique — such as the unconfirmed assumption that these compounds contribute equally to psychoactive properties — it serves as a rough comparison of potency between species . Despite its small size , Psilocybe semilanceata is considered a " moderately active to extremely potent " hallucinogenic mushroom ( meaning the combined percentage of psychoactive compounds is typically between 0 @.@ 25 % to greater than 2 % ) , and of the 12 mushrooms compared , only 3 were more potent : P. azurescens , P. baeocystis , and P. bohemica . According to Gartz ( 1995 ) , P. semilanceata is Europe 's most popular psychoactive species . 
 Several reports have been published in the literature documenting the effects of consumption of P. semilanceata . Typical symptoms include visual distortions of color , depth and form , progressing to visual hallucinations . The effects are similar to the experience following consumption of LSD , although milder . Common side effects of mushroom ingestion include pupil dilation , increased heart rate , unpleasant mood , and <unk> reflexes . As is typical of the symptoms associated with psilocybin mushroom ingestion , " the effect on mood in particular is dependent on the subject 's pre @-@ exposure personality traits " , and " identical doses of psilocybin may have widely differing effects in different individuals . " Although most cases of intoxication resolve without incident , there have been isolated cases with severe consequences , especially after higher dosages or persistent use . In one case reported in Poland in 1998 , an 18 @-@ year @-@ old man developed Wolff @-@ Parkinson @-@ White syndrome , arrhythmia , and suffered myocardial infarction after ingesting P. semilanceata frequently over the period of a month . The cardiac damage and myocardial infarction was suggested to be a result of either coronary vasoconstriction , or because of platelet <unk> and occlusion of small coronary arteries . 
 In 1998 , a study reported the presence of the pharmacologically active drug phenethylamine from samples collected in Sweden . The concentration of the compound was highly variable in the samples tested , but in one case was as high as 146 micrograms per gram of mushroom ( wet weight ) . This compound , a <unk> product of the amino acid phenylalanine , has received considerable interest in psychiatric research , as it may be a neuromodulator of aminergic synapses ( neurons that use monoamines as a neurotransmitter ) and it has been suggested to enhance energy , elevate mood , and promote aggression . The authors propose that there may be an interaction between phenylethylamine and psilocin ( the metabolic breakdown product of psilocybin ) through competitive inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzymes . 
 One danger of attempting to consume hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms , especially for novice mushroom hunters , is the possibility of misidentification with toxic species . In one noted case , an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous Cortinarius rubellus for P. semilanceata . As a result , he suffered end @-@ stage renal failure , and required a kidney transplant . In another instance , a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in <unk> cardiomyopathy , characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the <unk> . A polymerase chain reaction @-@ based test to specifically identity P. semilanceata was reported by Polish scientists in 2007 . 
 = = = Legal status = = = 
 The legal status of psilocybin mushrooms varies worldwide . Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Class A ( United Kingdom ) or Schedule I ( US ) drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances . The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms , including P. semilanceata , is therefore prohibited by extension . Although many European countries remained open to the use and possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms after the US ban , starting in the 2000s ( decade ) there has been a tightening of laws and enforcements . In The Netherlands , where the drug was once routinely sold in licensed cannabis coffee shops and smart shops , laws were instituted in October 2008 to prohibit the possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms — the final European country to do so . 
 = Bentworth = 
 Bentworth is a village and large civil parish in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire , England . The nearest town is Alton , which lies about 3 miles ( 5 km ) east of the village . The parish covers an area of 3 @,@ 763 acres ( 15 @.@ 23 km2 ) and at its highest point is 712 feet ( 217 m ) above sea level . According to the 2011 census , Bentworth had a population of 553 . 
 Bronze Age and Roman remains have been found in the area and there is evidence of an Anglo @-@ Saxon church in the village . The manor of Bentworth was not named in the Domesday Survey of 1086 , but it was part of the Odiham Hundred . During the Second World War , Bentworth Hall was requisitioned as an outstation for the Royal Navy and nearby Thedden Grange was used as a prisoner of war camp . 
 The parish contains several manors including Bentworth Hall , Hall Place , Burkham House , Wivelrod Manor , Gaston Grange and Thedden Grange . The 500 @-@ acre ( 2 @.@ 0 km2 ) estate of Bentworth Hall was split up as a result of various sales from the 1950s . St Mary 's Church , a Grade II * listed building which parts of which date back to the late 11th century , lies at the centre of the village . The village has two public houses , the Star Inn and the Sun Inn ; a primary school ; and its own cricket club . Bentworth formerly had a railway station , Bentworth and Lasham , on the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway until the line 's closure in 1936 . The nearest railway station is now 3 @.@ 8 miles ( 6 @.@ 1 km ) east of the village , at Alton .

 The village name has been spelt in different ways , including : <unk> or <unk> ( 12th century ) and <unk> ( c . 15th century ) . The original meaning of the name Bent @-@ worth may have been a place of cultivated land , or a way through land such as woodland . The Swedish scholar Eilert Ekwall argues that a derivation from the Old English bent @-@ grass is unlikely , and suggests a derivation from The <unk> of <unk> 's people . 
 In October 1935 a Neolithic basalt axe @-@ head was found near Weller 's Place Farm , indicating occupation in prehistoric times . Pot sherds and faunal remains from the Iron Age and several coins have been discovered , including a Bronze coin of Valentinian I , discovered in 1956 . The Romans built a road between the Roman town of Silchester to the north of Old Basing , and the Roman settlement of <unk> , just east of the present @-@ day town of Alton , which measured 15 Roman miles . 
 A Bronze Age cremation urn was found in 1955 just north of Nancole Copse , approximately 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) from St Mary 's Church . The urn is now displayed in the Curtis Museum in Alton , together with a bronze Roman coin of Valentinian I that was found in a garden about 0 @.@ 6 miles ( 0 @.@ 97 km ) south of St Mary 's near Tinker 's Lane . Belgic pottery and animal bones were found in 1954 at Holt End , a hamlet south of Bentworth . Pottery , bone objects , spindle @-@ whorls ( stone discs with a hole in the middle used in spinning thread ) and fragments of Roman roofing tiles were unearthed at Wivelrod Manor .

 Bentworth was not mentioned separately in the 1086 Domesday Survey , although the entry for the surrounding Hundred of Odiham mentions that it had a number of outlying parishes that included Bentworth . Soon after Domesday , Bentworth became an independent manor . Between 1111 and 1116 it was granted by Henry I to Geoffrey , Count of Anjou . 
 The earliest mention of Bentworth village was in the charter of 1111 – 1116 from Henry I to the Archdiocese of Rouen of " the manor of <unk> and the <unk> ( outlying farm ) of <unk> ( present day Burkham ) " . St Mary 's Church was not included in this charter but in 1165 King Henry II granted it to <unk> , then the Archdiocese of Rouen . When King John began losing his possessions in Normandy he took back the ownership of several manors , including Bentworth . He then ceded Bentworth manor to Peter des Roches , the Bishop of Winchester , in 1207 – 8 . The manor was returned to Rouen , who held the property until 1316 , when Edward II appointed Peter de <unk> as its custodian . 
 Some time after 1280 a new stone hall house was built at Bentworth , a typical medieval hall house and has been variously called Bentworth Hall ( until 1832 ) and Bentworth Manor House . Since 1832 it has been known as Hall Place . In 1333 the property owner was granted the right for a private chapel on the premises . Maud de Aula was given permission to hold services at Bentworth Hall chapel from 1333 to 1345 ; the remains of this building can be seen today immediately to the southwest of Hall Place . In February 1336 to manor was granted to Peter , Archbishop of Rouen , but he appeared to subsequently have nothing to do with it , as four months later ownership of the manor passed to William Melton , the Archbishop of York . Upon his death in 1340 he left his possessions to his nephew William de Melton , the son of his brother Henry . 
 In 1348 , William de Melton obtained King Edward III 's permission to give his manor to William <unk> , Bishop of Winchester . The ownership of the manor of Bentworth was then passed by marriage to the Windsor family , who had been constables of Windsor Castle . The Bentworth Hall estate was evidently returned to the Melton family , because it is mentioned among their possessions in a document dated to 1362 . It then passed to William 's similar @-@ named son , Sir William de Melton . Sir William 's son , John de Melton , who inherited the house in 1399 , was recorded as owner of the manor of Bentworth in 1431 . He died in 1455 , and was succeeded by his son until the latter 's death in 1474 , then finally his grandson John Melton . After the death of the last , the manor of Bentworth remained in the possession of the Windsor family for at least 150 years .

 In 1590 , Henry Windsor ( 1562 – 1605 ) , the 5th Lord Windsor , sold the sub @-@ manor of Bentworth to the Hunt family , who had been tenants since the beginning of that century . Ownership passed in 1610 to Sir James <unk> of Odiham and in 1651 to Thomas Turgis , a wealthy London merchant . His son , also Thomas , described as one of the richest commoners in England , left the manor of Bentworth to his relative William Urry , of <unk> Manor in 1705 . In 1777 William Urry 's daughters Mary and Elizabeth married two brothers , Basil and William Fitzherbert of <unk> Hall , Staffordshire . Their sister @-@ in @-@ law was Maria Fitzherbert , the secret wife of the Prince Regent , later King George IV . In about 1800 , Mary Fitzherbert ( who had eleven children ) became owner of Bentworth Manor and Manor Farm .

 In 1832 the Fitzherbert family sold the Bentworth Hall estate at an auction in London to Roger Staples Horman Fisher for approximately £ 6000 . Almost immediately Fisher started building the present Bentworth Hall . In 1848 the estate was sold to Jeremiah Robert Ives . The Ives family later shared ownership with the author George Cecil Ives who lived for a time at the hall with his paternal grandmother . In 1898 a station for the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway was proposed which would serve <unk> , Lasham and the village of Shalden . Land was taken from the villages of Bentworth and Lasham to provide for the railway station . In 1870 – 72 the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales by John Marius Wilson described Bentworth as 
 ... a village and parish in Alton district , Hants . The village stands 3 ½ miles WNW of Alton r. station , and had a post office under Alton .

 Bentworth Hall was requisitioned for war use and was where a number of organisations were based . In 1941 it was used by the Mobile Naval Base Defence Organization ( MNBDO ) and it was later an outstation of the Royal Navy 's Haslar Hospital in Portsmouth , the bedrooms being used as wards . Later , it was occupied by officers from the airfield at Lasham ; one commander kept an aircraft in a field towards New Copse and used it as transport to Lasham Airfield . From 1942 – 44 Thedden Grange was used as a prisoner of war camp . During the war nissen huts were built on what is now the <unk> housing estate . The War Department had occupied the <unk> property and constructed 26 nissen huts and other structures on the grounds , some of which were converted into civilian housing after the war . In 1966 the property was sold and 41 homes were built on the former site of <unk> estate and brewery .

The Berens family arms included a bear , and when Berens acquired the Bentworth Hall estate , carvings of bears were put up in various places . Two of which can be seen at the entrance to the Bentworth Hall drive , between the two lodge houses . Herbert Berens died on 27 October 1981 , and the remaining estate was put up for sale . Initially Bentworth Hall was offered as a single property , but its outbuildings were divided into a number of separate dwelling units and other parts were sold to local farms . In June 1982 , the Bentworth Conservation Area was established , incorporating many of the local buildings of note , extending along the main lane and around the church . 
 Bentworth was awarded a gold postbox in 2012 after Peter Charles , a resident of the village , won a gold medal in the equestrian event of the 2012 Summer Olympics .

 = Sons of Soul = 
 Sons of Soul is the third studio album by American R & B group Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! , released on June 22 , 1993 , by Wing Records and Mercury Records . The group originally recorded at several studios in California , including Westlake Recording Studios and Paradise Recording Studio . When they became jaded with the various people frequenting those studios , Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! moved their sessions to Caribbean Sound Basin in Trinidad , where they ultimately wrote and recorded most of the album . 
 Sons of Soul was produced entirely by the group , who worked with various session musicians and utilized both vintage and contemporary recording equipment . They intended to pay homage to their musical influences — classic soul artists of the 1960s and 1970s — and incorporated live instrumentation , funk , and hip hop elements such as samples and scratches . Lead singer and bassist Raphael Wiggins handled most of the songwriting , which featured quirky , flirtatious lyrics . 
 A commercial success , Sons of Soul charted for 43 weeks on the Billboard 200 and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . It was acclaimed by music critics and named the best album of 1993 by The New York Times and Time magazine . With its success , Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! became one of the most popular R & B acts during the genre 's commercial resurgence in the early 1990s . However , after an ill @-@ fated tour , the group went on hiatus and pursued individual projects before reuniting in 1995 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Inspired by live instrumentation , turntablism , and classic soul music , Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! recorded and produced their second album , The Revival , mostly themselves and released it in 1990 to commercial success . The record broadened the group 's exposure to fans beyond their initial R & B audience . However , they became ambivalent about their newfound mainstream success and their music being labeled " retro " by critics . In an interview for People magazine , lead singer and bassist Raphael Wiggins expressed his dissatisfaction with the music industry , saying that " every record company wants to get a group and put ' em in a Benz with a car phone and a beeper , show them dressing in three different outfits , put them in a video shot on a beach with lots of swinging bikinis . You won 't ever see us on a beach . We 're just down @-@ to @-@ earth , funky , like @-@ to @-@ play guys . " Before considering a follow @-@ up album , the band recorded several songs for film soundtracks , including " Me and You " for Boyz n the Hood ( 1991 ) , " House Party ( I Don 't Know What You Come to Do ) " for House Party 2 ( 1991 ) , and " Waiting on You " for Poetic Justice ( 1993 ) . 
 Having fulfilled their creative intentions with The Revival , Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! wanted to pay homage to their musical influences with Sons of Soul . In a 1993 interview for The New York Times , Wiggins elaborated on their direction for the album , stating " We 're paying homage to a lot of older artists who paved the way for us artists like the Temptations , Sly and the Family Stone , Earth , Wind and Fire . They 're the people who inspired us when we were growing up , people like Aretha Franklin , James Brown . We feel we 're the sons of everything and all those people who came before us . " He also explained the album 's title as a declaration of them being descendants of those artists , " not in a grandiose sense , but from the standpoint that we really are the musical offspring of all that 's come before us ... paying homage to our past , but creating in a contemporary environment . "

 The group began recording Sons of Soul in 1993 . They initially held sessions at several recording studios in California , including Air L.A. Studios , Paramount Recording Studios , and Westlake Recording Studios in Hollywood , Pajama Studios in Oakland , <unk> Recording in Oakland Hills , and Paradise Recording Studio in Sacramento , where Raphael Wiggins resided at the time . Wiggins , his brother guitarist D 'wayne Wiggins , and drummer Timothy Christian Riley each played several instruments for the album . Raphael and D 'wayne came up with ideas for songs by playing guitar and a drum machine , and working them into compositions with Riley and Carl Wheeler , an unofficial member and in @-@ studio keyboardist for the group . They also created drum loops at their homes , with Raphael using an Akai MPC60 and D 'wayne using an Emulator <unk> , and the group improvised their respective instrumental parts for songs at the studio to a certain loop . 
 They also worked with various session musicians , including string arranger Benjamin Wright , saxophonists Gerald Albright and Lenny Pickett , trumpeter Ray Brown , arranger Clare Fischer , and audio engineer Gerry Brown . Brown engineered the group 's previous albums , and later their subsequent output , including Raphael Wiggins ' solo albums after Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! . Brown recommended for him to use a dynamic microphone when recording his vocals to thicken them with more bass , a practice Wiggins continued throughout his career . Wiggins sought after former Temptations vocalist Eddie Kendricks to sing on " Leavin ' " , but Kendricks died prior to the sessions . They also worked with two horn sections , The Fat Lip Horns and The SNL Horns , the horn section of the Saturday Night Live Band . Raphael and D 'wayne Wiggins sang impromptu musical ideas to the SNL players , who in turn modelled their horn parts after their singing . 
 = = = Trinidad sessions = = = 
 Jaded with their lifestyles in California and the various people frequenting the studios , the group moved the sessions to Caribbean Sound Basin in Maraval , a suburb of Port of Spain , Trinidad . The studio complex was one of Trinidad 's few high @-@ end recording locations and was founded in 1990 by Trinidadian businessman Robert Amar , who wanted to attract both local and international recording artists with a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art facility and the area 's culture . The group intended to use to the studio only to polish their previous sessions ' output , but ended up writing and recording what became most of the album for two months . D 'wayne Wiggins said of the move in an interview for Musician , " the record company really wanted to put what we had out , but we ourselves didn 't feel like the album was done . " 
 Caribbean Sound Basin housed three separate studios and several amenities , including a swimming pool , gym , sauna , photographic studio , and bedroom suites . In contrast to most recording studios , its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light . At the studio complex , Raphael , D 'wayne , and Riley recorded extensively into the night and went out to enjoy the nightlife , before returning to the studio . They often dimmed the lights , burned incense , and drank wine to set the mood when recording , which D 'wayne explained in Musician , " We try to make it real calm and mellow . ' Cause you want to be able to get into what you 're singing . " They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late @-@ night block parties that lasted until dawn . D 'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in <unk> : " We 'd heard dancehall , but we didn 't really know anything about it before going there . We would go to these block parties and you could hear them from almost a mile away . You 'd just park on the street and walk to the party along with four or five thousand other people , all partying with these giant speakers all over the place . And this happened just about every weekend . " 
 Their subsequent recording for the album was influenced by their experiences in Trinidad and Caribbean musical styles , including the rhythms and festive atmosphere of the local music scene . They enlisted Trinidadian dancehall artist General Grant , a regular at Caribbean Sound Basin , to perform a ragga rap on " What Goes Around Comes Around " and " Dance Hall " , songs they developed in Trinidad . Raphael Wiggins recalled this in an interview for the Toronto Star : " [ Grant ] was just hanging around the studio . We asked him to come freestyle on [ ' What Goes Around Comes Around ' ] . After that , he just kept hanging around . Then we had the song ' Dance Hall ' playing one night and he started again , so we just turned on the mic . " " My Ex @-@ Girlfriend " was also recorded there . According to D 'wayne , they recorded " Tonyies ! In the Wrong Key " in the studio at 3 a.m. , and Raphael was " quite <unk> " on an alcoholic beverage when delivering his vocals . Collectively , the group had written and recorded approximately 40 songs at the end of the sessions . In an interview for Billboard , D 'wayne Wiggins said that they focused on the love songs when having to decide what songs would make the album . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Unlike with their previous albums , the group produced Sons of Soul entirely themselves . They utilized both vintage and contemporary recording gear in the album 's production , including a Hammond B @-@ 3 , Clavinet , ARP String Ensemble , and Korg and Roland synthesizers . Riley viewed that hearing music played from the older instruments affected their songwriting . For his vocals , Raphael recorded with Neumann U 87 and AKG <unk> <unk> microphones , as well as a vintage RCA Type 77 @-@ DX microphone . He used a custom five @-@ string bass from a guitar and bass repair shop in San Francisco , as well as a Minimoog analog synthesizer for other bass lines on the album . D 'wayne used a <unk> <unk> <unk> for his lead vocals and an AKG 414 for his background vocals . He played a vintage Gibson <unk> @-@ S and a Fender Coronado guitar , modified with Gibson burst <unk> pickups . Aside from his drumming , Riley played both Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes electric pianos . 
 Caribbean Sound Basin 's main studio had both analog and digital equipment , a 60 ft x 70 ft x 18 ft live room , and three isolation booths , for vocals , piano , and drums . The group recorded original tracks using Studer 24- and 48 @-@ track recorders and transferred them to a Sony digital recorder . For most songs , MIDI keyboards were played live into a sequencer and left <unk> , while vintage keyboards were recorded to analog tape . Riley said of the process in an interview for Keyboard magazine , " even though we used a sequencer for some stuff , we 'd still cut the song live from start to finish . See , the last record was all done with a Synclavier . But this time , we tried to keep it all live and raw . " 
 Record producer and DJ Ali Shaheed Muhammad , credited for programming on the album , assisted in its production . He cited the group 's fusion of hip hop production and live instrumentation for Sons of Soul as the inspiration for his subsequent work as a member of A Tribe Called Quest and The Ummah . Muhammad discussed his experience recording Sons of Soul in a 1998 interview , saying that " I 'd just hooked this beat up , and [ the group ] picked up their instruments and started playing . Raphael was singing , and as soon as he touched the bass , it just blew me away . " Raphael Wiggins explained how they valued instrumentation when recording the album , saying that " We want everyone to have something to relate to ; a drummer will get into the live drums and so on . " 
 Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! tracked the final mixes of the songs at Caribbean Sound Basin . Its main studio used a 64 @-@ channel SSL <unk> G mixing console , the secondary studio used a 48 @-@ track Neve console with flying faders , and its third studio used an <unk> <unk> console . The group mostly used the older Neve console . In tracking the songs , they started with a drum machine groove as a basic track and recorded it . The parts recorded with live instrumentation were then added to the mix . Live drums and horn sections were included to attain the sound of performing live . Sons of Soul was subsequently mastered by engineer Herb Powers at his New York City studio P.M. Entertainment . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Sons of Soul expanded on the traditional R & B influences of The Revival , with upbeat funk and classic Motown styles . Songs such as " If I Had No Loot " , " My Ex @-@ Girlfriend " , and " Tell Me Mama " incorporated lively tempos , strident harmonies , melodic hooks , and lead vocalist Raphael Wiggins ' high tenor singing . Other songs were performed with funk grooves , including " I Couldn 't Keep It to Myself " , " Gangsta Groove " , " Fun " , and " Tonyies ! In the Wrong Key " . Rick Mitchell of the Houston Chronicle wrote that the songs ' arrangements " cleverly ... integrate classic influences into contemporary grooves . " Carl Allen of The Buffalo News claimed that the album " reconnected " black popular music " to its gospel / blues roots with hip @-@ hop flair . " Along with older R & B , the album 's music appropriated contemporary urban styles such as dancehall and hip hop , incorporating hip hop beats , turntable scratches , and samples , which were taken from both contemporary rap and older soul . Tony Green of the St. Petersburg Times viewed that Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! incorporated musical aspects from their R & B and hip hop contemporaries , thereby " representing black pop 's Generation X. Mid- to late @-@ <unk> caught [ at ] the tail end of the heyday of acts like Earth , Wind & Fire and Stevie Wonder [ and ] found themselves getting smacked in the face by the rap revolution . " The group reproduced what they sampled with live instrumentation , which Keyboard magazine interpreted their as an analog approach to the principally digital hip hop genre . 
 The lyrics on Sons of Soul were described by Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson as often quirky , while Elysa Gardner from Vibe said they were flirtatious and tender , particularly on ballads such as " Slow Wine " and " ( Lay Your Head on My ) Pillow " ; she felt the group 's songwriting throughout the album possessed a " reverent " ethos . Raphael Wiggins was credited with the majority of the songwriting . Laura Zucker of The Sacramento Bee said most of the album was written " solidly in the R & B tradition of sweet talking and romancing . " Unlike most contemporary R & B and hip hop music at the time , the album 's lyrics lacked profane language , with the exception of " My Ex @-@ Girlfriend " , which featured the chorus " I couldn 't believe it / They tried to tell me my ex @-@ girlfriend is a ho ! " 
 " If I Had No Loot " has a New jack swing beat , pronounced guitar licks , vocal samples from hip hop songs , and lyrics about fair @-@ weather friends . " My Ex @-@ Girlfriend " is a humorous commentary on unfaithful partners , and features lowbrow humor in its lyrics , which scold an ex @-@ girlfriend for her promiscuity . It evolved from a concept D 'wayne Wiggins came up with after driving past an Oakland hangout for prostitutes and recognized that one of them was an old friend . The upbeat ballad " Tell Me Mama " has surging dynamics , a horn @-@ filled bridge , and lyrics about responsibility and regret . Phil Gallo of the Los Angeles Times writes that the song utilizes " Jackson 5 and Temptations vocal stylings , Earth , Wind & Fire horn charts and riffs from Sly & the Family Stone hits " . According to Rolling Stone journalist Fred Schruers , the album 's first five songs comprise a " tour de force that bounces from Motown to New Jack Swing and back before breaking for a series of ballads as sexy as they are sweet " . 
 " Slow Wine " describes a Trinidadian slow grind dance , and the love ballad " ( Lay Your Head on My ) Pillow " features tender , seductive lyrics , with subtle come @-@ ons , which according to Gil Griffin of The Washington Post " replace hip @-@ hop braggadocio with soul music 's promise . " " I Couldn 't Keep It to Myself " features lush strings and electric piano , which according to one writer " create a jaunty atmosphere that harkens back to early Kool and the Gang and the <unk> . " Its narrator wants to brag to his friends about his new girlfriend 's sexual abilities . " Gangsta Groove " adapts hip hop 's " gangsta " trope in a humane story , compared by one writer to a blaxploitation theme . It draws on the funk music of Parliament @-@ Funkadelic , Cameo , and the Ohio Players . " Tonyies ! In the Wrong Key " features a dreamy , dissonant soundscape , slurred vocals , swirling horns , and a James Brown sample . At its end , Raphael Wiggins sings the line " last night a DJ saved my life " , a reference to the 1982 song of the same name . Wiggins found his " disinterested " vocal style similar to Sly Stone 's " Family Affair " ( 1971 ) . 
 " Dance Hall " is styled in the genre of the same name , and also incorporates funk . The segue track " Times Squares 2 : 30 A.M. " was recorded by the group on the street with a tape recorder . " Fun " has a hip hop groove , jazz fusion tone , and irreverent , party theme similar to " Dance Hall " . " Anniversary " is about mature , lasting love . Elysa Gardner of Vibe calls it " a grandly romantic , nine @-@ minute bolero that lavishes its female subject with such warmth and respect that the cheeky misogyny of [ ' My Ex @-@ Girlfriend ' ] seems instantly <unk> . " " <unk> " is a short vocal track and tribute to Raphael and D 'wayne 's <unk> High School chorus group , <unk> Choir , in which they sung as students . Raphael said of its inspiration , " The high school choir was all about that classic R & B harmony , so I named the song after the choir . One of the great things about that experience at school was that it got us ready to go out in the professional world with our music . " 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Sons of Soul was released on June 22 , 1993 , by Wing Records and Mercury Records , who created a heavy promotional campaign seeking to capitalize on the success of the group 's previous album . The record opened to strong sales and became Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! ' s highest @-@ charting album . It debuted at number 38 on the Billboard 200 chart in the week of July 10 .

On November 14 , 1995 , the album was certified double platinum by the RIAA , for shipments of two million copies in the US . By 1997 , it had sold 1 @.@ 2 million copies , according to Nielsen SoundScan . 
 Sons of Soul received widespread critical acclaim . Billboard praised the record 's traditional influences and contemporary sensibilities , calling it " a prismatic record from a maturing group " , and The New Yorker said Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! easily transitioned from " irresistible dance tracks ... to lovely , sensuous ballads " on the album . In the Chicago Tribune , Greg Kot hailed Sons of Soul as " the most accomplished merger of hip @-@ hop attitude with a ' 70s R & B aesthetic " , deeming the group 's funk and soul music savvy , particularly because of their incorporation of Memphis soul guitars and fashionable rhythms and turntable scratches . Kot compared Raphael Wiggins to Stevie Wonder as a singer , while USA Today 's James T. Jones believed the record 's groovy , catchy songs were comparable to Sly Stone . Reviewing the album in Time , Christopher John Farley found the music elegant and more innovative than the band 's previous records . Michael Saunders from The Boston Globe believed even without a song as great as their 1990 hit " Feels Good " , the record was " unquestionably better than nearly all of the formulaic soul / pop albums littering the charts " , featuring ballads that sounded intimate without being overly sentimental . Robert Christgau was somewhat less enthusiastic in The Village Voice , citing " If I Had No Loot " and " Anniversary " as highlights while jokingly calling the group " sexy liars of the year " . In a more critical review , Spin 's Jonathan Bernstein was not impressed by songs such as " If I Had No Loot " and " What Goes Around Comes Around " , accusing Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! of competing with contemporary R & B acts such as Silk , H @-@ Town , and Intro . 
 Sons of Soul was voted the number 19th best album of the year in The Village Voice 's annual Pazz & Jop critics ' poll . Q magazine included it on its list of the 50 Best Albums of 1993 , while Time ranked the album number one on its year @-@ end list and stated , " the Tonyies are a real band , with real instruments , who have succeeded in bringing the art of <unk> @-@ B. songwriting back to the future . " It was also named the best album of the year by James T. Jones IV of USA Today , and The New York Times , while Newsday named it one of the year 's best albums . In 1994 , " Anniversary " was nominated for Grammy Awards for Best R & B Song and Best R & B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals . The album also earned Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! a 1994 critics ' award for Best R & B Group from Rolling Stone . In 1995 , Q included Sons of Soul in its publication " In Our Lifetime : Q 's 100 Best Albums 1986 – 94 " , a list compiled to celebrate its 100th issue . In 2007 , Vibe included the record in its list of the 150 Essential Albums of the Vibe Era ( 1992 – 2007 ) . 
 To promote Sons of Soul , Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! embarked on a supporting tour that broadened their audience and concert repertoire . Aside from national venues , they promoted the album with concerts in Europe , Australia , and Japan . They also performed on television shows such as Saturday Night Live , Late Show with David Letterman , and The Apollo Theatre Hall of Fame ceremony . In November 1993 , the group joined singer Janet Jackson 's high @-@ profile Janet . World Tour as a supporting act . However , after a few performances , the band left in January 1994 , expressing frustration over their limited time onstage and Jackson 's frequent show cancellations . Riley said they were also forced to alter their set list for Jackson 's more mainstream , pop audience , while a tour staffer recalled the group " left the tour with no advance notice " and " were extremely unprofessional . " They were replaced by Mint Condition as Jackson 's opening act . Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! subsequently went on hiatus , as each member pursued his own musical projects , producing and writing for other recording artists , before reuniting to record their 1996 album House of Music . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Sons of Soul bridged the gap between commercial and critical success for Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! , helping them become one of the most popular acts in R & B at the time . Its success exemplified the genre 's commercial resurgence during the early 1990s , when hip hop became the predominant African @-@ American music genre in the mainstream . In 1994 , Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune attributed its resurgence to younger artists ' blend of live instrumentation and hip hop production values , and cited Sons of Soul as " the most accomplished merger of hip @-@ hop attitude with a ' 70s R & B aesthetic . " The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution hailed it as " a gentle reminder of those glory days " and felt that the group having both vocal and musical talents is most indicative of a return to early R & B 's aesthetics . Furthermore , they garnered mainstream attention in a year of several high @-@ profile controversies with R & B and hip hop artists such as Michael Jackson and Snoop Dogg . David W. Brown of The Harvard Crimson wrote that Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! is " known primarily for the quality of its music , not its extracurricular reputation , unlike other groups such as Jodeci who rely on a playa @-@ gangsta @-@ <unk> image to sell @-@ records . " 
 Along with acts such as Mint Condition and R. Kelly , Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! played live instruments that complemented their hip hop sensibilities . Their concerts featured visual elements such as incense smoke and kaleidoscopic stage lighting , the group 's eccentric wardrobe , and additional instrumentalists , including another guitarist , two drummers , two keyboardists , a violinist , a trumpeter , and a saxophonist . The Charlotte Observer remarked on the group in 1994 : " [ T ] heir use of live instruments on record and onstage makes them an anomaly in the synthesized and sampled world of modern R & B. " With the group 's reliance on traditional soul and R & B values of songwriting and instrumentation , Sons of Soul was a precursor to the neo soul movement of the 1990s . Matt Weitz of The Dallas Morning News wrote in 1993 that the group had distinguished themselves from their New jack swing contemporaries with Sons of Soul and found them aesthetically akin to acts such as Prince and P.M. Dawn . Raphael Wiggins said of their success with the album : 
 " We 've been very blessed to be able to be a group that writes our own songs and people have accepted us from both sides , hip hop and the R & B crowd or whatever you might want to say . I feel very fortunate to be able to do that here in 1993 – 94 , because like you know , it was starting to be a dying thing that was happening . But I guess we were like the bridge between hip hop and soul and R & B , and being a little bit commercial also helped us . A lot of humor , a lot of nice slow songs and being able to play kind of brought us a foundation . " 
 D 'wayne Wiggins cited Sons of Soul as his favorite album with the group . Vibe and the Philadelphia Daily News also viewed it as the group 's best album ; the latter wrote that " it may be the project that got the public 's ears ready for all the similarly soulful artists yet to come . " Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that they " received their greatest chart success , without compromising their music " , which " was still the finely crafted , highly eclectic and funky pop @-@ soul that distinguished their first two albums , " but with improved songwriting and playing . Rickey Wright of the Washington City Paper called the album " <unk> brilliant " and said that it showcased " deeply resourceful songwriters who kept up with their audience " . He added that " hardly anything in ' 90s R & B has touched it " . Fred Schruers , writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) , mostly credited Raphael Wiggins for the record 's success and said his " high tenor glides as smoothly and confidently as his songwriting " .

 While the Griffins are watching television , the power goes out and they are left with no other form of entertainment . While they wait for the power to return , Peter decides to retell the story of Star Wars beginning with " Part IV . " 
 A Rebel ship is captured by a Star Destroyer . On the ship are the droids C @-@ 3PO ( Quagmire ) , R2 @-@ D2 ( Cleveland ) and the rebel leader Princess Leia ( Lois ) . While the ship is boarded by Stormtroopers , Leia tries to send an MPEG to Obi @-@ Wan Kenobi through R2 , but encounters so many complications that R2 offers to deliver the message himself . Leia is captured by Darth Vader ( Stewie ) while R2 and 3PO flee to Tatooine in an escape pod , where they are captured by <unk> . 
 The droids are sold to a family of moisture farmers , whose nephew Luke Skywalker ( Chris ) wishes to join the Rebellion and fight the Empire . While cleaning the droids , Luke stumbles upon Leia 's message inside R2 , who later decides to leave the farm . Luke and C @-@ 3PO pursue him but are attacked by Sand People . Luke is knocked out by one of them ( Opie ) and is found by Obi @-@ Wan Kenobi ( Herbert ) , who takes them to his hut . Leia 's message explains that R2 contains the plans to the Death Star , which must be sent to her father on her home planet of Alderaan and asks Obi @-@ Wan to help . Obi @-@ Wan tells Luke that he must learn the ways of The Force and accompany him to Alderaan , and gives him his own lightsaber . Realizing that the Empire must be looking for the droids , Luke returns home to discover that his home has been destroyed and his aunt and uncle killed . 
 Luke , Obi @-@ Wan , and the droids travel to Mos Eisley to find a pilot to take them to Alderaan . At a local cantina they hire smuggler Han Solo ( Peter ) and his Wookiee co @-@ pilot Chewbacca ( Brian ) , who agree to take them with their ship , the Millennium Falcon . The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space , evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace . Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star , where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin ( Adam West ) has Alderaan destroyed . The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star 's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay . Disguising themselves as stormtroopers , Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi @-@ Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and <unk> stay behind . Han , Luke and Chewie rescue Leia , and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch . As they flee the Death Star , Obi @-@ Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel . Vader strikes Obi @-@ Wan down as the others board the Falcon , taking the couch with them . 
 The Falcon journeys to the Rebel base at Yavin IV , where the Rebels analyze the Death Star plans and find a weakness . Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave . The Rebel fighters attack the Death Star but suffer heavy losses during the assault . During his run , Luke hears Obi @-@ Wan 's voice telling him to use the Force , and he turns off his targeting computer . Vader appears with his own group of fighters , and is about to fire at Luke 's starfighter when Han arrives in the Falcon and attacks Vader and his men , sending Vader 's ship off into space . Guided by the Force , Luke fires into the port , destroying the Death Star , and he returns to the Rebel base with his friends to celebrate their victory . 
 Back at the Griffins ' home , Peter wraps up the story as the power comes back on . Everyone thanks Peter for keeping them entertained , although Chris points out that Robot Chicken already told that story .

 " Blue Harvest " originally aired on September 23 , 2007 , as the premiere for the sixth season of Family Guy . The episode was written by Alec Sulkin , who has been with the show since the fourth season . It was directed by series veteran Dominic Polcino , who has been directing for the series since its first season . Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors . The episode 's music was composed by Walter Murphy . 
 Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane explained that the reason they made a parody of Star Wars in particular was because the show 's staff members were huge fans of the films . Another reason they chose Star Wars was because Lucasfilm allowed it . MacFarlane stated that creating parodies based on Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan was originally considered , but they assumed they would be unable to gain permission from the owners of those properties ( in this case Paramount Pictures ) . Lucasfilm only gave the show 's staff one condition , which was that the characters had to look exactly like they do in the movies . 
 Clips of the episode were shown to audience members at Star Wars Celebration IV , where a panel was hosted by MacFarlane , Sulkin and Polcino , and executive producer David A. Goodman . The episode was also previewed at the 2007 Comic @-@ Con International . 
 In addition to the regular cast , actors Chevy Chase and Beverly D 'Angelo , musician Mick Hucknall , singer Helen Reddy , and political commentator Rush Limbaugh made guest appearances . Recurring guest voice actors Phil LaMarr , Johnny Brennan , John Benjamin , Lori Alan , Adam West , Ralph Garman , writer Danny Smith , writer John Viener , executive producer Steve Callaghan , Kirker Butler , executive producer Mark Hentemann writer Wally Wingert and Alec Sulkin also made minor appearances in the episode . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 " Blue Harvest " contains many references to popular culture , particularly to the Star Wars film series . Most of the episode itself is a retelling of George Lucas ' film Star Wars . The episode 's name is a reference to the fake working title for the production of Return of the Jedi . 
 One of the band members that plays at the cantina asks for any song request and then he subtly responds to his own question by saying " play that same song , " a reference to the fact that the song being played in the film scene lasts a long time . 
 When Peter is about to begin telling the story he says that it is about " love and loss , father and son and the foresight to retain international merchandising rights " , a reference to the fact that 20th Century Fox gave those rights to Lucasfilm . During the text scrawl actress Angelina Jolie , her film Gia , and the television channel HBO are mentioned . 
 One of the Star Destroyers displays a bumper sticker reading " Bush – Cheney " a reference to United States President George W. Bush and Dick Cheney 's 2004 re @-@ election campaign . When the Millennium Falcon enters hyperspace , the visual effect is replaced with the intro sequence from Doctor Who , using the version of that sequence from the Tom Baker era . Once Leia is captured , Vader asks her where she hid the Death Star plans , leading her to respond that they are in one of twenty @-@ six briefcases , a reference to the game show Deal or No Deal . 
 When Luke is watching the sunset , he breaks the fourth wall by introducing Star Wars composer John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra , who have been scoring the scene , in a parody of a scene from Blazing Saddles featuring Count Basie and his orchestra . Luke then asks the orchestra to play the theme of The People 's Court . Later in the episode when Luke finds his uncle and aunt murdered , he also finds that Williams and the entire orchestra have been killed as well ; this saddens Luke , since the episode will now have to be scored by composer Danny Elfman . A political commentator on the radio is heard saying that the " liberal galactic media is saying that the planet Hoth is melting " , this commentator is voiced by Rush Limbaugh , who also runs a political radio program in which he criticizes what he perceives as the " liberal media " . 
 Obi @-@ Wan sings a rendition of " ( I 've Had ) The Time of My Life " from the film Dirty Dancing , in case he never sees Luke again . In a fight with a group of TIE fighters , Luke asks the origins behind their name ; the following scene then shows that the pilots are from Thailand . Leslie Nielsen 's character from the movie Airplane ! wishes Han good luck during their encounter with the TIE fighters . When seeking how to destroy the Death Star , the rebels look at an instructional video hosted by basketball player Magic Johnson . Chevy Chase and Beverly D 'Angelo 's characters from the National Lampoon 's Vacation films appear driving by the Death Star . Chris , who is voiced by Seth Green , points out that Robot Chicken already did a Star Wars parody ( Green is the creator of Robot Chicken ) . 
 It is also noted Han Solo 's reward doesn 't consist of money but rather various novelties including a Netflix gift card , Cracker Barrel cheese , a bottle of <unk> , a mini teddy bear and a lightsaber cheese knife .

For those of us who know Family Guy better than Star Wars , there is plenty of bad material here to remind us that nothing much has changed " . He gave the episode sixty @-@ five out of a possible one @-@ hundred . 
 The Parents Television Council , a group that has been a frequent critic of Family Guy , criticized the episode for a perceived frequent use of sexual dialogue , enough for the episode to have an " S " content descriptor for sexual content ( the episode was rated TV @-@ 14 @-@ <unk> on Fox ) .

 = SMS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse = 
 SMS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse ( " HMS Emperor William the Great " ) was a German pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the Kaiser Friedrich III class , built around the turn of the 20th century . The ship was one of the first battleships built by the German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) as part of a program of naval expansion under Kaiser Wilhelm II . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was built in Kiel at the Germaniawerft shipyard . She was laid down in January 1898 , launched in June 1899 , and completed in May 1901 . The ship was armed with a main battery of four 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in two twin gun turrets . 
 Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse served in the main fleet — the Heimatflotte ( Home Fleet ) and later the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) — for the first seven years of her career . She participated in several of the fleet 's training cruises and maneuvers , primarily in the North and Baltic Seas . Her peacetime career was relatively uneventful and she suffered no accidents . She was decommissioned for a major reconstruction in 1908 – 10 , after which she was assigned to the Reserve Division with her four sister ships . 
 At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , the battleship and her sisters were placed back in active service as the V Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet and tasked with coastal defense in the North Sea . They were also deployed briefly to the Baltic but saw no action . In 1915 , the ships were again withdrawn from service and relegated to secondary duties . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was used as a depot ship in Kiel and eventually a torpedo target ship . After the war , the Treaty of Versailles greatly reduced the size of the German Navy . The vessel was sold for scrapping to a German company and broken up in 1920 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was 125 @.@ 3 m ( 411 ft 1 in ) long overall and had a beam of 20 @.@ 4 m ( 66 ft 11 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 89 m ( 25 ft 11 in ) forward and 8 @.@ 25 m ( 27 ft 1 in ) aft . She displaced 11 @,@ 097 t ( 10 @,@ 922 long tons ) normally and up to 11 @,@ 785 t ( 11 @,@ 599 long tons ) at full load . The ship was powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines that drove three screw propellers . Steam was provided by four Marine @-@ type and eight cylindrical boilers , all of which burned coal . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse 's powerplant was rated at 13 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 12 @,@ 822 ihp ; 9 @,@ 561 kW ) , which generated a top speed of 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ; 20 @.@ 1 mph ) . 
 The ship 's armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 inch ) SK L / 40 guns and twelve 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns . She also carried twelve 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) machine cannon . Six 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes were mounted in above @-@ water swivel mounts . The ship 's belt armor was 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) thick , and the deck was 65 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) thick . The conning tower and main battery turrets were protected with 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of armor , and the secondary casemates received 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) of protection .

 Kaiser Wilhelm II , the emperor of Germany , believed that a strong navy was necessary for the country to expand its influence outside continental Europe . He initiated a program of naval expansion in the late 1880s ; the first battleships built under this program were the four Brandenburg @-@ class ships . These were immediately followed by the five Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleships , of which Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was the third . Her keel was laid on 22 January 1898 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel , as construction number 22 . She was ordered under the contract name Ersatz König Wilhelm , to replace the obsolete armored frigate König Wilhelm . Her scheduled launching on 29 April 1899 was delayed to 1 June after a large fire at the shipyard damaged the slipway . Louise , the Grand Duchess of Baden , christened the ship after her father Wilhelm I of Germany , the ship 's namesake . Wilhelm II gave the launching speech for the ship commemorating his grandfather . After completing fitting @-@ out work , dockyard sea trials began on 19 February 1901 , followed by acceptance trials that started on 18 March . These were completed by May , and she was formally commissioned on 5 May . That year , Erich Raeder — who went on to command the Kriegsmarine in World War II — was promoted to serve as a watch officer aboard her . 
 After commissioning in 1901 , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse joined her sister ships in the I Squadron of the Heimatflotte ( Home Fleet ) . After her sister Kaiser Friedrich III ran aground and had to be docked for repairs , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse replaced her as the I Squadron flagship , which was commanded by Prince Heinrich , the brother of Wilhelm II . She held this post until 24 October , when Kaiser Friedrich III returned to service . In the meantime , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was present for the Kiel Week sailing regatta in June and the dedication of a monument at the <unk> ( Naval Academy ) in Kiel . At the end of July , she led the squadron on a cruise to Spanish waters , and while docked in Cádiz , they rendezvoused with the Brandenburg @-@ class battleships returning from East Asian waters . The I Squadron was back in Kiel by 11 August , though the late arrival of the Brandenburgs delayed the participation of the I Squadron in the annual autumn fleet training . The maneuvers began with exercises in the German Bight , followed by a mock attack on the fortifications in the lower Elbe . Gunnery drills took place in Kiel Bay before the fleet steamed to Danzig Bay , where the maneuvers concluded on 15 September . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and the rest of I Squadron went on their normal winter cruise to Norway in December , which included a stop at Oslo from 7 to 12 December . 
 In 1902 , the new battleship Wittelsbach ran aground off <unk> ; Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse took her under tow back to port . The I Squadron went on a short cruise in the western Baltic then embarked on a major cruise around the British Isles , which lasted from 25 April to 28 May . Individual and squadron maneuvers took place from June to August , interrupted only by a cruise to Norway in July . The annual fleet maneuvers began in August in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade . During the exercises , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was assigned to the " hostile " force , as were several of her sister ships . The " hostile " force was first tasked with preventing the " German " squadron from passing through the Great Belt in the Baltic . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and several other battleships were then tasked with forcing an entry into the mouth of the Elbe River , where the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and Hamburg could be seized . The " hostile " flotilla accomplished these tasks within three days . The regular winter cruise followed during 1 – 12 December . 
 In 1903 , the fleet , which was composed of only one squadron of battleships , was reorganized as the " Active Battle Fleet " . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse remained in the I Squadron along with her sister ships and the newest Wittelsbach @-@ class battleships , while the older Brandenburg @-@ class ships were placed in reserve to be rebuilt . The first quarter of 1903 followed the usual pattern of training exercises . The squadron went on a training cruise in the Baltic , followed by a voyage to Spain from 7 May to 10 June . In July , the I Squadron went on its annual cruise to Norway . The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea , a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September , and finally a mock attack on Kiel . The exercises concluded on 12 September . The winter cruise began on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and continued into the Skagerrak on 1 December . 
 = = = 1904 – 14 = = = 
 The I Squadron held its first exercise of 1904 in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January . Further squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March . A major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May , and in July the I Squadron and the I Scouting Group visited Britain , stopping at Plymouth on 10 July . The German fleet departed on 13 July , bound for the Netherlands ; the I Squadron anchored in Vlissingen the following day . There , the ships were visited by Queen Wilhelmina . The I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July , when it departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet . The squadron stopped in Molde , Norway , on 29 July , while the other units went to other ports . The fleet reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel , where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August . The fleet then began preparations for the autumn maneuvers , which began on 29 August in the Baltic . The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September , where it took part in a major landing operation , after which the ships took the ground troops from the IX Corps that participated in the exercises to Altona for a parade for Wilhelm II . The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September . Three days later , the fleet returned to the Baltic via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal , where it participated in further landing operations with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps . On 15 September , the maneuvers came to an end . The I Squadron went on its winter training cruise , this time to the eastern Baltic , from 22 November to 2 December . 
 The ships of the I Squadron went on a pair of training cruises during 9 – 19 January and 27 February – 16 March 1905 . Individual and squadron training followed , with an emphasis on gunnery drills . On 12 July , the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea . The fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm . The summer cruise ended on 9 August ; the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month . The British fleet stopped in Danzig , Swinemünde , and Flensburg , where it was greeted by units of the German Navy ; Kaiser Wilhelm II and the main German fleet were anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion . The visit 's impact was lessened by the ongoing Anglo @-@ German naval arms race . As a result of the British visit , the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably , from 6 to 13 September , and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea . The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight , and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe . During the exercises , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse won the Kaiser 's Schiesspreis ( Shooting Prize ) for excellent gunnery in the I Squadron . In October , the ship was reassigned to the I Division of the II Squadron . In early December , the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise , this time to Danzig , where they arrived on 12 December . On the return trip to Kiel , the fleet conducted tactical exercises . 
 Over the winter of 1906 – 07 , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse underwent a major overhaul in Kiel , which was completed by the end of April . By this time , the newest Deutschland @-@ class battleships were coming into service ; along with the Braunschweig @-@ class battleships , these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons . As a result , the Heimatflotte was renamed the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) . Starting on 13 May , major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the Skagen into the Baltic . The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid @-@ July . The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August . The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland , to join exercises being conducted there . The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August , where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began . On 22 – 24 August , the fleet took part in landing exercises in Eckernförde Bay outside Kiel . The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden , along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel . The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days . 
 A shorter period of dockyard work took place from 7 December to 27 January 1908 . She returned to the fleet for the normal peacetime routine of training exercises , and after the conclusion of the autumn maneuvers , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was decommissioned in Kiel on 21 September . She was taken into the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel for an extensive modernization that lasted until 1910 . During the refit , four of the ship 's 15 cm guns and the stern @-@ mounted torpedo tube were removed . Two 8 @.@ 8 cm guns were added and the arrangement of the 8 @.@ 8 cm battery was modified . Her superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship 's tendency to roll excessively , and the ship 's funnels were lengthened . After reconstruction , the ship was assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic , along with her sister ships . She was reactivated on 31 July 1911 and assigned to the III Squadron during the annual fleet exercises , then returned on 15 September to the Reserve Division . She remained there for the rest of her peacetime career . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 As a result of the outbreak of World War I , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914 . The ships were prepared for war very slowly , and were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August . They were initially tasked with coastal defense , but they served in this capacity for a very short time . In mid @-@ September , the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic , under the command of Prince Heinrich . He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault against the Russians at Windau , but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan . Instead , the V Squadron was to carry the landing force , but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day , disembarked the landing force , and then proceeded to the North Sea , where they resumed guard ship duties . Before the end of the year , the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic . 
 Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward Gotland . On 26 December 1914 , the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie . Two days later , the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag , and was back in Kiel by 30 December . The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties , but was withdrawn from front @-@ line service in February 1915 . Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet , coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime , necessitated the deactivation of Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and her sisters . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse first went to Hamburg , where her crew was reduced on 5 March . She was moved to Kiel on 30 April , where the rest of her crew were removed . She was disarmed and thereafter used as a depot ship . The following year , the ship was used as a torpedo target ship . In November 1918 , Germany surrendered and signed the Armistice at Compiègne that ended the fighting . According to Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles , signed on 28 June 1919 , that formally ended the war , Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the " Deutschland or Lothringen types " . On 6 December 1919 , the vessel was struck from the naval list and sold to a shipbreaking firm based in Berlin . The following year , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was broken up for scrap metal in Kiel @-@ Nordmole . 
 = Walden – Wallkill Rail Trail = 
 The Walden – Wallkill Rail Trail , also known as the Jesse McHugh Rail Trail , is a 3 @.@ 22 @-@ mile ( 5 @.@ 18 km ) rail trail between the village of Walden , New York and the neighboring hamlet of Wallkill . The two communities are located in Orange and Ulster counties , respectively , in upstate New York . 
 The trail , like the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail to the north , is part of the former Wallkill Valley Railroad 's rail corridor . The land was purchased by the towns of Montgomery and Shawangunk in 1985 and converted to a public trail . The portion of the trail in Shawangunk was formally opened in 1993 and named after former town supervisor Jesse McHugh . Plans to pave the trail between Walden and Wallkill were discussed since 2001 , and the route was finally paved between 2008 and 2009 . The trail includes an unofficial , unimproved section to the north of Wallkill , and is bounded by NY 52 and NY 208 . 
 = = History = = 
 Stretching 33 miles ( 53 km ) from Montgomery to Kingston , the Wallkill Valley Railroad operated from 1866 until its last regular freight run on December 31 , 1977 . In the 1980s , Conrail , then the owner of the Wallkill Valley line , attempted to sell the former rail corridor . The towns of Montgomery and Shawangunk – in Orange and Ulster counties , respectively – purchased their sections of the rail line to allow " development of a commercial corridor [ as well as ] utility easements and access " to a local reservoir . 
 The Montgomery section consisted of 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from the village of Walden to the town line with Shawangunk , and the Shawangunk section ran 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) north from the town line to Birch Road . The purchases were completed in August and October 1985 , respectively . In November of that year , the New York State Department of Correctional Services bought 1 @.@ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 3 km ) of the former corridor in Shawangunk 's hamlet of Wallkill , near the Wallkill Correctional Facility . This portion extends from Birch Road to the town line with Gardiner . The Shawangunk Correctional Facility was built at that location . South of Walden , the corridor remains an active rail line operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway . 
 North of the prisons , the former corridor continues as the separate Wallkill Valley Rail Trail . Rail trail enthusiasts have been trying to find a way to combine the two rail trails since the 1990s , and in 2004 the town of Shawangunk commissioned an open space study that identified possible ways to accomplish such a connection . A 2008 Ulster County transportation plan included projects to connect the trails , and the town of Shawangunk is currently considering plans to connect the trails by diverting the corridor along Birch Road . The original route of the corridor is 40 feet ( 12 m ) within the prisons ' perimeter fence . 
 The portion of the former corridor running through the center of Wallkill was converted to a road , Railroad Avenue . The southern part of the route , running from Wallkill to the Montgomery – Shawangunk town line , was officially opened as the Jesse McHugh Rail Trail on June 5 , 1993 . Jesse McHugh was a former Shawangunk town supervisor . The northern portion of the Shawangunk section , which stretches to the border of the prison grounds , is maintained by the town but not officially part of the trail . 
 In 2001 , Shawangunk , Montgomery and the Walden began applying for over $ 600 @,@ 000 in TEA @-@ 21 grants to create a paved , Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( ADA ) <unk> trail between Walden and Wallkill . The total cost of paving the trail was expected to be $ 750 @,@ 000 , though it eventually ballooned to $ 1 @.@ 5 million . The decision to pave the trail was vehemently opposed by horseback riders who felt it would endanger them , and protested at several public meetings by the Mid @-@ Hudson Horse Trails Association . The decision was also opposed by nearby homeowners who believed an increase in trail use would threaten their privacy . 
 In October 2003 , Walden , Shawangunk and Montgomery acquired the $ 600 @,@ 000 grant needed to begin paving the trail . Two months later , Bob and Doris Kimball , a couple in Montgomery , donated 20 acres ( 8 @.@ 1 ha ) of their land to create a park by the trail near Lake Osiris Road . The park is expected to be developed once funds are available to do so . Nearly $ 200 @,@ 000 in funding to complete pavement of the trail was lost when the outgoing 109th Congress did not approve a 2006 budget bill . In February 2008 , Congressman Maurice Hinchey announced the appropriation of $ 351 @,@ 000 to complete the project . Construction began on September 22 , 2008 , and the paved 3 @.@ 22 @-@ mile ( 5 @.@ 18 km ) trail opened on May 2 , 2009 . Flooding from hurricanes in 2011 caused a cave @-@ in along the Montgomery section of the trial . The storms eroded much of the ground beneath the trail , causing the ground to sink . As of July 2012 , no repairs have been completed ; the cost of fully repairing the trail was estimated to be $ 214 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Route = = 
 The trail begins at the 9 @.@ 4 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 8 ha ) Wooster Grove Park in the village of Walden , near NY 52 . There is a visitor center for rail trail users at the park . The park also contains Walden 's former train station , which has since been renovated as a recreational facility . 
 The trail continues 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north from the trailhead before reaching Lake Osiris Road , continuing another 1 1 ⁄ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 0 km ) to the Montgomery – Shawangunk town line . Once in Shawangunk , the trail passes by the Borden Estate , a mansion built in 1906 by the granddaughter of Gail Borden . In 1854 , Gail Borden patented the process for creating condensed milk ; the Borden family subsequently owned a series of milk companies . The mansion is now used by the School of Practical Philosophy for philosophy classes . 
 About 3 ⁄ 4 mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) from the town line , the trail reaches its Wallkill trailhead bordering NY 208 , directly across the street from the Shawangunk police station . The paved section between Walden and Wallkill is flat , with only a 3 % grade . A portion of the former corridor in central Wallkill has since been converted to a road . 
 An unimproved northern section in Wallkill extends 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the intersection of Railroad Avenue and C. E. Penny Drive to Birch Road . Birch Road marks the border between the former corridor and two state prisons . This section passes through private hunting grounds and is " unmarked and has no signs " but is " arguably ... the most scenic " portion of the former Wallkill Valley rail corridor , featuring " splendid " views of the Shawangunk Ridge to the west . 
 While the total length of the trail is officially only about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) , the inclusion of the northern section increases its length to about 4 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) . The trail is used for walking , jogging , bicycling and dog walking . 
 = Royton = 
 Royton ( pop . 21 @,@ 284 ( 2011 ) ) is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham , in Greater Manchester , England . It is situated close to the source of the River Irk , near undulating land at the foothills of the South Pennines , 1 @.@ 7 miles ( 2 @.@ 7 km ) north @-@ northwest of Oldham , 3 @.@ 2 miles ( 5 @.@ 1 km ) south @-@ southeast of Rochdale and 7 @.@ 6 miles ( 12 @.@ 2 km ) northeast of the city of Manchester . 
 Historically a part of Lancashire , Royton and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British , Roman and Viking activity in the area . During the Middle Ages , Royton formed a small township centred on Royton Hall , a manor house owned by a long succession of dignitaries which included the Byrons and <unk> . A settlement expanded outwards from the hall which , by as late as 1780 , " contained only a few straggling and mean @-@ built cottages " . Farming was the main industry of this rural area , with locals supplementing their incomes by hand @-@ loom woollen weaving in the domestic system . 
 Royton has the distinction of being the first town where a powered cotton mill was built ; at Thorp in 1764 , and is one of the first localities in the world to have adopted the factory system . The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution facilitated a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area , and by the mid @-@ 19th century Royton had emerged as a mill town . At its zenith , there were 40 cotton mills — some of the largest in the United Kingdom — employing 80 % of the local population . Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in Royton 's textile industry during the mid @-@ 20th century , and its last mill closed in 1998 . 
 Today , fewer than a dozen mills are still standing , the majority of which are used for light engineering or as distribution centres . Despite an economic depression brought about by the demise of cotton spinning , Royton 's population has continued to grow as a result of intensive housing redevelopment which has modernised its former Edwardian districts . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Toponymy = = = 
 The name Royton is Anglo @-@ Saxon in origin , and it has been suggested that the Rye crop is the root of the name ; " <unk> " is derived from Rye , with the Old English suffix -ton added to imply " rye farm " or " rye settlement " . The first known written record of the name <unk> ( or Ryton ) was in a survey of Lancashire in 1212 , although the name is believed to date from the 7th century as a result of Anglian colonisation which followed the Battle of Chester . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 There is evidence of Stone Age human activity in the area , by way of a Neolithic stone axe found at Royton Park . The ancient Britons are thought to have inhabited the area , and the Romans to have traversed it ; the remains of a Roman or Early Medieval bloomery was discovered in 1836 . There is no physical manifestation of the Vikings / Norsemen in the locality , but toponymic evidence implies they have been present ; the hamlet of Thorp is the oldest settled locality in Royton , and its name is of Old Norse origin meaning " farm , estate or village " . 
 <unk> in the Domesday Book of 1086 , Royton does not appear in records until 1212 , when it was documented to have been a thegnage estate , or manor , comprising twelve oxgangs of land , with an annual rate of 24 shillings payable by the tenant , William Fitz William , to King John of England . From William , who died in 1223 , Royton passed to his son Thomas , who was still alive in 1254 . Thomas 's daughter Margery , who married Alexander Luttrell of Somerset , sold the majority of Royton and its outlying land to John de Byron in around 1260 . It is from this exchange that the Byron family came to use Royton as their chief place of residence until the early part of the 17th century . 
 The early history of Royton is linked closely with what was then its manor house , Royton Hall , which was inhabited by the Byron family for over 350 years . During that period the Byrons ' involvement in regional and national affairs added prestige to what was otherwise an obscure and rural township . John de Byron was a witness to the charter of incorporation of 1301 , which elevated the township of Manchester to the status of a borough . A descendant of John — John Byron — served as High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1572 , and was knighted by Elizabeth I in 1579 . John served as Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire at the time of the Spanish Armada , and sourced infantry from Royton towards the English military . His son , also called John , fought during the English Civil War on the side of the Cavaliers . His actions led to making him John Byron , 1st Baron Byron of Rochdale by way of a peerage granted by King Charles I. Following the regicide of Charles I , and the rise of Cromwellian England , Baron Byron 's possessions , including his lands in Royton , were confiscated . Royton Hall was then purchased by Thomas Percival , a wealthy linen manufacturer whose descendants continued to occupy the hall until around 1814 . The hall was then inherited by the Radcliffe Baronets .

 Apart from the dignitaries who lived in Royton Hall , the population of Royton during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of retainers and farmers , most of whom were involved with pasture , but supplemented their incomes by weaving woollens in the domestic system . The area was thinly populated and consisted of several hamlets , including Thorp , Heyside and Royton village itself as the nucleus . During the Early Modern period , the weavers of Royton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers ' cottages , but as both the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton @-@ spinning machinery improved during the early @-@ 18th century , the need for larger structures to house bigger , better and more efficient equipment became apparent . The construction of a water powered cotton mill by Ralph Taylor at Thorp Clough in 1764 , is said to be the first structure of its kind . The construction of more mills followed , which initiated a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation in the region ; the population moved away from farming , adopting employment in the factory system . The introduction of the factory system led to a tenfold increase of Royton 's population in less than a century ; from 260 in 1714 to 2 @,@ 719 in 1810 . Despite its growth as a centre for cotton @-@ cloth production , and the construction of a chapel of ease in 1754 , in 1780 Royton was said to have " contained only a few straggling and mean @-@ built cottages " . The people of Royton continued to produce cotton goods ( mainly cloth ) and sell them at the market in Manchester . 
 During this period of growth , Royton 's parliamentary representation was limited to two members of parliament for Lancashire , and nationally , the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and chronic unemployment for textile weavers . By the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions , coupled with the lack of suffrage in northern England , had enhanced the appeal of political Radicalism in the region . The Manchester Patriotic Union , a group agitating for parliamentary reform , began to organise a mass public demonstration in Manchester to demand the reform of parliamentary representation . Organised preparations took place , and a spy reported that " seven hundred men drilled at Tandle Hill as well as any army regiment would " ; a few days later , on 3 August , a royal proclamation forbidding the practice of drilling was posted in Manchester . 
 On 16 August 1819 , Royton ( like its neighbours ) sent a contingent of its townsfolk to Manchester to join the mass political demonstration now known as the Peterloo massacre ( owing to the 15 deaths and 400 – 700 injuries that followed ) . Royton 's contingent was of particular note , in that it sent a sizable female section to the demonstration . 
 Royton 's damp climate provided the ideal conditions for cotton spinning to be carried out without the cotton drying and breaking , and newly developed 19th century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for mass production for the global market . By 1832 , there were 12 steam powered mills in Royton , of which its former hamlets had begun to agglomerate as a town around the cotton factories , a number of small <unk> and new turnpike road from Oldham to Rochdale , which passed through the town centre . The Manchester , Oldham and Royton railway and a goods yard was constructed in the 1860s , allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township . Neighbouring Oldham ( which by the 1870s had emerged of the largest and most productive mill town in the world ) had begun to encroach upon Royton 's southern boundary , forming a continuous urban cotton @-@ spinning district . The demand for cheap cotton goods from this area prompted the flotation of cotton spinning companies ; the investment was followed by the construction of 22 new cotton mills in Royton . Together with Oldham , at its peak the area was responsible for 13 % of the world 's cotton production . 
 Supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861 – 1865 , leading to the formation of the Royton Local Board of Health in 1863 , whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality . On 26 November 1884 an explosive device containing gunpowder was detonated in Royton Town Hall , in a cellar underneath the offices of Royton 's local board . An anonymous communication was received by the supposed bomber , stating that he intended the explosion for the Royton School Board because children are not allowed to work at the age of 10 years , and because he wanted the abolition of the Factory Acts . There were no fatalities caused by the explosion , and damage to the building was restricted to smoke damage and shattered windows , doors and woodwork . The Great Depression , and First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline in Royton . However , in as late the 1950s , 80 % of Royton 's population was employed in the textile mills . As imports of cheaper foreign yarns increased during the mid @-@ 20th century , Royton 's textile sector declined gradually to a halt ; cotton spinning reduced in the 1960s and 1970s , and by the early 1980s only four mills were operational . In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production , the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998 . Less than a dozen mills are still standing in Royton , the majority of which are now used for light engineering or as distribution centres . 
 = = = Post @-@ industrial history = = = 
 Since deindustrialisation , Royton 's population has continued to grow as a result of intensive housing redevelopment which has modernised much its former Edwardian terraced housing districts , and the construction of retail and business parks , which provide employment . The town has subsequently been described as " doing better than most " in Greater Manchester . Despite this , since the turn of the millennium Royton has been earmarked for cosmetic gentrification . In the 2000s , Royton was used as a filming location for the BBC One police drama Life on Mars , particularly the area near Lion Mill . Life on Mars is set in 1970s Manchester . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century , Royton anciently constituted a thegnage estate , held by tenants who paid tax to the King . Royton during the Middle Ages formed a township in the parish of Prestwich @-@ cum @-@ Oldham , and hundred of Salford . <unk> , law and order was upheld in the locality by two constables , chosen by the community and appointed annually by Vestry meetings . 
 Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 , Royton formed part of the Oldham Poor Law Union , an inter @-@ parish unit established to provide social security . Royton 's first was a local board of health established in 1863 ; Royton Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township . In 1871 Royton was noted as a large village @-@ chapelry , and a sub @-@ district of the Oldham registration district . In 1879 , a part of the neighbouring township of Thornham was amalgamated into the area of the local board . Following the Local Government Act 1894 , the area of the Local Board became the Royton Urban District , a local government district within the administrative county of Lancashire . The urban district council was based in Royton Town Hall , which had been purpose built for the local board in 1880 . In 1933 , a part of the neighbouring Municipal Borough of Middleton was transferred to Royton Urban District . Under the Local Government Act 1972 , the Royton Urban District was abolished , and Royton has , since 1 April 1974 , formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham , a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester . Royton has two of the twenty wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham : Royton North and Royton South . 
 In terms of parliamentary representation , Royton after the Reform Act 1832 was represented as part of the Oldham parliamentary borough constituency , of which the first Members of Parliaments ( MPs ) were the radicals William Cobbett and John Fielden . Winston Churchill was the MP between 1900 and 1906 . Constituency boundaries changed during the 20th century , and Royton has lain within the Royton ( 1918 – 1950 ) , Heywood and Royton ( 1950 – 1983 ) , and Oldham Central and Royton ( 1983 – 1997 ) constituencies . Since 1997 , Royton has lain within Oldham West and Royton . Until his death in 2015 , it was represented in the House of Commons by Michael Meacher , a member of the Labour Party .

 Described in Samuel Lewis 's A Topographical Dictionary of England ( 1848 ) as being in " aspect rather wild " , Royton lies in a shallow valley amongst undulating land . The sources of the rivers Irk and Beal are to the northeast and east respectively . The Irk meanders southwesterly into Chadderton , and then onwards to Middleton into Manchester before uniting its waters with the River Irwell in Manchester city centre . The general slope of the land decreases in height away from the Pennines , from east to west , but reaches high points of 509 feet ( 155 m ) at Tandle Hill and 825 feet ( 251 m ) at the summit of Oldham Edge , a ridge of elevated land which leads to Oldham . The soils of the town are broadly sand with subsoils of clay .

 = = Economy = = 
 From the 18th century onwards , Royton 's economy was closely tied with that of Britain 's textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , particularly the cotton spinning sector . However , Royton also lies on the Oldham Coalfield , and coal mining had an economic role for the area in as early as the 17th century . Mining peaked in the 19th century with over 200 collieries in the town . Royton 's pits were prone to repeated flooding , and owners began to close them . Coal production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry , with the last pit closing in 1902 . 
 Since deindustrialisation , Royton 's economic activity has been focused around a 22 @-@ acre ( 8 @.@ 9 ha ) business park at Salmon Fields which includes distribution companies such as <unk> and Holroyd Meek , manufacturing firms including bed manufacturers Slumberland , and formerly included vehicle assembly at Seddon Atkinson . Formerly an area of " green fields " , the Salmon Fields Business Village was proposed in 1983 , and developed into a business park later that decade despite objections that the estate would ruin a " beautiful area " , and cause noise pollution . There are additional retail parks in the locality , including The Centre ( formerly Elk Mill Retail Park ) , which lies at the start of the A627 ( M ) motorway . 
 Opposite Royton Town Hall is a shopping precinct containing 23 shop units and a supermarket operated by The Co @-@ operative Food . The site was opened in 1971 and occupies the town 's former market street , which was demolished in 1969 . In 2004 a report noted that a weakness of the precinct is that it lacks a variety of shops . 
 = = Landmarks = = 
 Historically , Royton 's only landmark was Royton Hall , the township 's former manor house which was inhabited by local dignitaries from its construction ( in as early as the 13th century ) to 1814 . Part of the hall was erected during the 16th century , but the east wing was crafted in the Elizabethan or Jacobean architectural style . In 1794 it was described as " pleasantly seated in a deep valley , surrounded by high grounds . It is a firm , well built stone edifice of ancient date " . During World War I , Royton Hall was used to house Belgian refugees , and following the war was bought by Dr John Thomas Godfrey . After he took his family to South Africa , it stood empty until it was converted into flats . The hall fell into disrepair in the 1930s and was demolished in 1938 . The foundations of the structure were excavated in 2005 leading to the discovery of original panes of glass and a Tudor stair tower . 
 Royton Town Hall is a purpose @-@ built municipal building opened in September 1880 , by James Ashworth , the first Chairman of Royton Local Board of Health . It was constructed in a free style of architecture , and includes a domed roof and clock tower topped by a copper cupola . By the entrance is a flagstaff which flies the Union Flag . The clock tower is inscribed on three sides with Latin mottos : " Tempus Fugit " ( time flies ) , " Sic <unk> <unk> " ( so the years pass by ) and " <unk> <unk> " ( have regards to the end ) . The clock face on the east side , facing Shaw and Crompton is half the size of the other three . A local tale is that when the Church of Holy Trinity at Shaw was constructed in 1869 , it had no clock on the western facade of its clock tower , which faced Royton . The reduced clock face size at Royton Town Hall is said to have been a retaliation . 
 Royton War Memorial lies at the summit of Tandle Hill , and was erected " in memory of the men of Royton who gave their lives for the freedom and honour of their country " during the First World War . It is a Portland stone obelisk , that originally bore plaques listing the fallen , and had a bronze sculpture of Victory at its base . It was commissioned by the Royton War Memorial Committee and unveiled on 22 October 1921 by Edward Stanley , 17th Earl of Derby . The original plaques were stolen in 1969 , and replacements were later installed in the grounds of Royton 's Church of St Paul . 
 Royton Library is a Carnegie library , a gift of Andrew Carnegie . It was opened in 1907 by Edward Stanley , 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley , an aristocrat and former Member of Parliament for the area . The surnames of four prominent writers — Bacon , Carlyle , Spencer and Milton — are inscribed above one of four windows on the building face , by the entrance .

 Public transport in Royton is co @-@ ordinated by the TfGM . Major A roads link Royton with other settlements , including the <unk> road . Originally built as a turnpike between Oldham and Rochdale , the <unk> bisects Royton from the southeast , forming the town 's main street , before continuing northwards through Rochdale , Burnley and terminates at the village of <unk> in Lancashire . The M62 motorway runs to the north of the area and is accessed via the A663 at junction 21 and junction 20 via the A627 ( M ) motorway , which terminates at Royton 's southwestern boundary . 
 Royton railway station lay at the end of a branch from Royton Junction on the Oldham Loop Line , which was part of the route which connected Manchester , Oldham and Rochdale . The station was opened in 1864 and closed in April 1966 . It featured steep gradients on the line up to Royton Junction , which , in October 1908 , caused an accident when a goods train ran out of control on the gradient down to the station , killing a fireman . In February 1961 , a four @-@ coach runaway train crashed through the buffers at Royton railway station and continued on over High Barn Street . Five houses were damaged . The driver of the train was injured , but there were no fatal or severe injuries to the public . Five people from the damaged houses were taken to hospital suffering from shock and bruises , and in one case a fractured clavicle .

 The Village School of Royton was founded in 1785 , and continued to provide education until 1833 , when a new school linked with Royton 's parish church of St Paul , was opened . The village school became the local Sunday School , but split from St Paul 's in 1838 , reopening as a day school . The village school closed in 1907 and was demolished in 1969 . Almost every suburb of Royton is served by a school of some kind , including some with religious affiliations . All the schools in the town perform either at or above the national average for test results . Royton has several primary schools , including St Annes , Thorp Primary School and <unk> Aidan and Oswalds Primary . Royton has two secondary schools , Royton and Crompton School and Our Lady 's R.C.

 Royton had no medieval church of its own , and for ecclesiastical purposes , lay within the parish of Prestwich @-@ cum @-@ Oldham in the Diocese of Lichfield , until 1541 , when this diocese was divided and Royton became part of the Diocese of Chester . This in turn was divided in 1847 , when the present Diocese of Manchester was created . For ritual baptisms , marriages and burials , the people of Royton , a Christian community , had to travel to churches that lay outside of the township 's boundaries , including Oldham , St Mary 's , Middleton , St Leonard 's or Prestwich , St Mary 's . 
 A chapel of ease under the mother church of Prestwich , St Mary 's , was built between 1754 and 1757 , paid for by voluntary contributions . The chapel was consecrated on 1 July 1757 , dedicated to Paul the Apostle . St Paul 's Chapel was extended throughout the 19th century as the population of Royton grew , with a tower and clock added in 1828 and extensions in 1854 and again in 1883 . The nave of the chapel was demolished in 1889 and the existing church building in neo @-@ Gothic style was erected . St Paul 's is in the Oldham West Deanery of the Diocese of Manchester . The Westwood Moravian Church congregation has recently relocated to Royton . 
 In addition to the established church , a variety of Reformed denominations have been practised in Royton . The Religious Society of Friends were recorded as holding conventicles in Heyside in as early as the 1650s . A Baptist meeting place was erected in 1775 . Congregational preachers regularly visited Royton , but it was not until 1854 that a workshop was established in the town . Primitive Methodism was established in Royton in a room in a <unk> building , with its first purpose @-@ built church being erected in 1867 .

 = E. C. Row Expressway = 
 The E. C. Row Expressway is a municipal expressway in the city of Windsor , Ontario , Canada . It divides the city in half as it crosses it between the Ojibway Parkway in the west and Banwell Road in the east , a distance of 15 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 6 mi ) . It was built between 1971 and 1983 , reaching completion across the city on June 9 , 1983 . Though it was formerly a part of Highway 2 and Highway 18 , the province fully transferred ownership and responsibility for the route to the City of Windsor on April 1 , 1997 . In 2015 , the westernmost 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) was significantly upgraded as part of the Herb Gray Parkway project . The expressway is named after Edward Charles Row , the president of Chrysler Canada between 1951 and 1956 . 
 While allowing for easy travel across the city , the E.C. Row Expressway does not connect to the United States yet ; drivers can access the Ambassador Bridge via Huron Church Road , or the Detroit – Windsor Tunnel via Dougall Parkway , which also provides the most direct access to Highway 401 . This situation will change as the expressway western terminus is located at the port of entry for the Gordie Howe International Bridge scheduled for completion in 2020 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The E.C. Row Expressway is a 15 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometre ( 9 @.@ 6 mi ) route with a speed limit of 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) . It begins at a signalized intersection with the Ojibway Parkway , curving gently from northeastward to eastward . It travels east @-@ northeast as a four lane controlled @-@ access highway with a grass median and grade @-@ separated interchanges . 
 After crossing Matchette Road , where ramps provide access to and from the eastbound and westbound lanes of the expressway , respectively , the opposing lanes of the expressway split to the south of Malden Park . The eastbound lanes diverge south and cross the Herb Gray Parkway , sandwiching it between the E. C Row Expressway . Ramps provide access between the two parallel freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the E. C. Row to the west of Huron Church Road . The expressway curves east @-@ northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions . After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue , the route crosses the Canadian National ( CN ) <unk> subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area . 
 The highway quickly meets another interchange at Howard Avenue , where it also crosses Turkey Creek and the former alignment of Grand Marais Road . Southeast of this interchange is Devonshire Mall while to the north are low @-@ density commercial units . East of the interchange , the E. C. Row once again travels between residential subdivisions . To the north lies Remington Park while to the south is Devonshire Heights . Crossing into Walkerville at a diamond interchange with Walker Road , the highway becomes surrounded by a business park ; the Walker Road interchange also connects with the Central Avenue interchange . 
 Now north of Windsor Airport , the route crosses over the Canadian Pacific Windsor Subdivision just west of a partial interchange with Jefferson Boulevard , which provides westbound access to and eastbound access from the expressway . The route passes south of the Ford Essex Engine Plant before meeting the Lauzon Parkway at an interchange . It crosses Little River before entering an area with a subdivision to the north and a commercial park to the south . The commercial zoning eventually transitions to agricultural fields , and the E. C. Row Expressway curves northeast and intersects Banwell Road at @-@ grade . East of Banwell Road , the road continues as the Pike Creek Bypass , former Highway 2 . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of the E.C. Row Expressway dates back to January 1963 , when the City of Windsor and the Department of Highways released a report called The Windsor Area Transportation Study ( <unk> ) . One of the primary issues identified by the study was " a limited and inadequate street network in the east @-@ west direction generally resulting from several railway barriers " . Properties were purchased along E.C. Row Avenue ( named in 1956 after the retiring president of Chrysler Canada , Ohio born Edward Charles Row ) and the Third Concession within Sandwich Township beginning in 1958 for what was then intended as a two lane road linking Highway 18 with Highway 39 ( which became Highway 2 in 1970 ) . However , with the release of <unk> and the subsequent amalgamation in 1966 in which Windsor annexed portions of the surrounding townships , plans for an expressway along the corridor were first conceived . The original plans for the expressway dating back to 1969 were for it to travel from current County Road 22 , heading west along the southern edge of Belle River and Tecumseh , meeting up with the current two @-@ lane freeway alignment ( Pike Creek Bypass ) just east of Puce , as well as having the west end continue south through Lasalle to north of Amherstburg . 
 The first stage of construction began in 1970 to bridge the two sections of E.C. Row Avenue over the CN railway line between Dougall Avenue ( then Highway 3B ) and Howard Avenue ( a former alignment of Highway 2 ) ; this work was completed in 1973 . In 1976 , contracts were awarded to extend the new divided expressway east to Walker Avenue . At the request of Ford Motor Company of Canada , construction on the expressway was soon accelerated . By early 1980 , the existing construction contracts were completed , and work began to connect the expressway between Huron Church Road and Dougall Avenue . Construction of a two @-@ laned extension west to connect with the Ojibway Parkway ( Highway 18 ) began by the end of that year . By April 1982 , the four @-@ laned expressway was complete between Huron Church Road and east of Lauzon Parkway , connecting with Highway 2 as a two lane expressway at Banwell Road in the east , and with Ojibway Parkway via a two lane expressway west of Huron Church Road . Following this , Highway 2 was rerouted west of Banwell Road off <unk> Road to instead travel along the expressway , while Highway 18 was rerouted off Sandwich Street to follow the expressway ; both then followed Highway 3 along Huron Church Road to the Ambassador Bridge . 
 Construction stalled for several years as funding was diverted from the project during a recession in the early 1980s . It would take until 1987 for work to resume to replace the at @-@ grade intersections at Matchette Road , Malden Road , Huron Church Road and Dominion Boulevard . The City of Windsor nevertheless earmarked funding from their budget to build the last two of those interchanges in late 1986 . The province later stepped in to provide a share of the funding in March 1987 , and work began with contracts being awarded for construction on August 26 and September 16 of that year for interchanges at Dominion Boulevard and Huron Church Road , respectively . The City of Windsor also negotiated with the province for funding of an interchange at Matchette Road in late April of that year , which was approved by September 1 . On September 29 , 1988 , the Huron Church Road and Dominion Boulevard interchanges were opened to traffic . 
 Work began in October 1989 to twin the existing two @-@ laned route between the Ojibway Parkway and Huron Church Road by building a second parallel roadway to serve as the eastbound lanes . Construction of a partial interchange at Matchette Road as well as an overpass of Malden Road was included in this project , which was completed in September 1990 . The project to complete the expressway in the east — by twinning the route between Lauzon Parkway and the Windsor boundary east of Banwell Road — began immediately after ; it was completed in late 1991 . The overall cost of the expressway between Ojibway Parkway and Banwell Road , originally estimated ( in 1967 ) at $ 55 million , was $ 115 million , out of which the province contributed $ 94 million . 
 Planning subsequently began to extend the expressway east to Manning Road along the existing two lane Pike Creek Bypass . However , budget constraints brought on by a recession in the early 1990s resulted in the Mike Harris provincial government forming the Who Does What ? committee to determine cost @-@ cutting measures in order to balance the budget after a deficit incurred by former premier Bob Rae . It was determined that many Ontario highways no longer served long @-@ distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government . The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998 , removing a significant percentage of the provincial highway network . As the E. C. Row Expressway was designed to serve commuter traffic in Windsor , and not province @-@ wide movement , the route was transferred to the City of Windsor on April 1 , 1997 . No work has progressed on the extension since . 
 Beginning in 2011 , the E.C. Row Expressway west of Huron Church Road underwent a complete reconstruction as part of the $ 1 @.@ 4 billion Herb Gray Parkway project which included a major realignment of 1 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 1 mi ) of the eastbound carriageway between Matchette Road and Huron Church Road to allow for an extension of Highway 401 to travel within their median . The project was completed on November 21 , 2015 . 
 As of 2015 , construction is underway on the widening and expansion of E.C. Row 's eastern extension , County Road 22 . Under the new plans , the highway is being widened to four lanes from Banwell Road to Old Tecumseh Road ( County Road 2 ) in Puce .

From the early 9th century to the 10th the church was treated as essentially a piece of property , with ownership passing between kings of Mercia and Wessex and the archbishops of Canterbury . Viking attacks may have extinguished the church 's religious community in the 9th century , although an early 11th @-@ century record indicates that the church was then in the hands of a dean accompanied by monks . By the time of Domesday Book , completed in 1086 , St Mary 's was serving as a parish church . 
 The original building , which incorporated stone and tiles scavenged from the Roman fort , was a simple one consisting only of a nave and an apsidal chancel , with a small room , or porticus , built out from each of the church 's northern and southern sides where the nave and chancel met . The church was much altered and expanded during the Middle Ages ; the last addition , in the 15th century , was of north and south porches leading into the nave . This expansion coincided with a long period of prosperity for the settlement of Reculver , but its decline led to the church 's decay and , in the face of coastal erosion , its almost complete demolition in 1809 . 
 The church 's twin towers were preserved by the intervention of Trinity House , since they had long been important as a landmark for shipping . Some materials from the structure were incorporated into a replacement church , also dedicated to St Mary , built at Hillborough in the same parish . Much of the rest was used for the building of a new harbour wall at Margate , known as Margate Pier . Other remnants of the original 7th @-@ century church apart from those on the site include fragments of a high cross of stone that stood inside the church , and two stone columns that formed part of an arch between the nave and chancel , which were still in place when the church was demolished . These are now kept in Canterbury Cathedral , and are among the features that have led to the church being described as an exemplar of Anglo @-@ Saxon church architecture and sculpture . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The first church known to have existed at Reculver was founded in 669 , when King Ecgberht of Kent gave land there to Bassa the priest for this purpose . The author of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle " clearly considered this to be a significant event " , and it may be that King Ecgberht 's intention in founding a church at Reculver was to create an ecclesiastical centre with a strong English element , to counterbalance domination of the Canterbury church by Archbishop Theodore , from Tarsus , now in Turkey , Abbot Hadrian of St Augustine 's , from North Africa , probably Cyrenaica , and their equally " non @-@ native followers . " Historians vary over whether to call the church a minster or a monastery – thus Susan Kelly uses the former term , but Nicholas Brooks uses the latter , commenting that : 
 [ w ] e do not know whether the Kentish monasteries had been founded as communities of monks and nuns dedicated to the service of God [ and living in monasteries and nunneries ] , or whether the male communities were from the start bodies of secular clergy [ operating from minsters ] who , like the archiepiscopal familia at Canterbury , accepted a degree of communal ( or monastic ) discipline and who were responsible for the pastoral care of extensive rural areas . ... [ T ] he distinction between the regular and secular clergy was blurred from the very beginning in England . Indeed the word <unk> does not necessarily refer to a house of monks in the eighth and ninth centuries , but like its English equivalent , minster ... , was also the normal term for a church served by a body of clergy . ... By the ninth century the communities of the Kentish monasteries were certainly composed of priests , deacons , and clergy in lesser orders , just like the cathedral community at the ' head minster ' , [ Canterbury Cathedral ] . 
 The foundation of this church , sited within the remains of the Roman fort of Regulbium , exemplifies the " widespread practice [ in Anglo @-@ Saxon England ] of re @-@ using Roman walled places for major churches " ; the new church was built " almost completely from demolished Roman structures " . The building formed a nave measuring 37 @.@ 5 feet ( 11 @.@ 4 m ) by 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) and an apsidal chancel , which was externally polygonal but internally round , and was entered from the nave through a triple arch formed by two columns made of limestone from Marquise , in the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region of northern France . The arches were formed using Roman tiles , but the columns were made for the church rather than being Roman in origin . Around the inside of the apse was a stone bench , and two small rooms , or porticus , forming rudimentary transepts were built out from the north and south sides of the church where the nave met the chancel , from which they could be accessed . The presence of a stone bench around the inside of the apse has been attributed to influence from the Syrian Church , at a time when its followers were being displaced . The walls of the church were rendered inside and out , giving them a plain appearance and hiding the masonry . 
 Ten years after the foundation of the church , in 679 , King Hlothhere of Kent granted lands at Sturry , about 6 @.@ 2 miles ( 10 km ) south @-@ west of Reculver , and at Sarre , in the western part of the Isle of Thanet , across the Wantsum Channel to the east , to Abbot Berhtwald and his " monastery " . The grant was made at Reculver , and the charter in which it was recorded was probably written by a Reculver scribe . The grant of Sarre in particular is significant : 
 Sarre was a highly strategic place , overlooking the confluence of the Wantsum and the Great Stour , [ and ] directly linked to Canterbury ... In the early 760s it was the site of a toll @-@ station , where the agents of the Kentish kings collected dues on trading ships using the Wantsum route ... The grant of Sarre to Reculver must be regarded as a sign of enormous royal favour to the [ church there ] ... and it may be that the [ church at Reculver ] received a share of the royal tolls levied at Sarre . 
 In the original , 7th @-@ century charter recording this grant , Reculver is referred to as a civitas , or city , but this is probably a reference to either its Roman past or the church 's monastic status , rather than a large population centre . In 692 Reculver 's abbot Berhtwald was elected Archbishop of Canterbury , from which position he probably offered Reculver patronage and support . Bede , writing no more than 40 years later , described Berhtwald as having been well educated in the Bible and experienced in ecclesiastical and monastic affairs , but in terms indicating that Berhtwald was not a scholar . 
 Further charters show that the monastery at Reculver continued to benefit from Kentish kings in the 8th century , under abbots Heahberht ( fl . <unk> ) , <unk> ( fl . 760 ) and <unk> ( fl . 784 ) , acquiring lands in Higham and <unk> and exemption from the toll due on one ship at Fordwich , and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried in the church in the 760s . Properties belonging to Reculver in the 7th and 8th centuries are indicated in passing by otherwise unrelated records , such as the estate at Higham , land probably in the High Weald area of Kent , from which iron may have been sourced for use or sale at or on behalf of Reculver , and an unidentified property named <unk> land in the district of <unk> . Such records also provide the names of other abbots of Reculver , namely Æthelmær ( fl . 699 ) , <unk> ( fl . <unk> ) , <unk> ( fl . 803 ) , <unk> ( fl . 805 ) , <unk> ( fl . <unk> ) , <unk> ( fl . <unk> ) , <unk> ( fl . <unk> ) and <unk> ( fl . <unk> ) . 
 By the early 9th century the monastery had become " extremely wealthy " , but from then on it appears in records as " essentially a piece of property " . For most of the period from 764 to 825 Kent was under the control of kings of Mercia , beginning with Offa ( 757 – 96 ) , who treated Kent as part of his patrimony : he may also have claimed direct control of Reculver , as he did with similar churches in other areas . In 811 control of the monastery appears to have been in the hands of Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury , who is recorded as having deprived it of some of its land . But by 817 Reculver was in the hands of King Coenwulf of Mercia ( 796 – 821 ) , together with the nunnery at Minster @-@ in @-@ Thanet , through which he would also have had strategically lucrative control of the Wantsum Channel : Coenwulf had by then secured a privilege from Pope Leo III that gave him the right to " dispose of his ... monasteries in [ England ] at will " . In that year a " monumental showdown " began between Archbishop Wulfred and King Coenwulf over the control of monasteries , featuring Reculver and Minster @-@ in @-@ Thanet in particular . The dispute over Reculver continued until 821 , when Wulfred " made a humiliating submission to [ Coenwulf ] " , surrendering to him an estate of 300 hides , possibly at Eynsham in Oxfordshire , and paying a fine of £ 120 , to secure the return of Reculver and Minster @-@ in @-@ Thanet . The record of the dispute indicates that Wulfred continued to be denied control of Reculver and Minster @-@ in @-@ Thanet after 821 by Cwoenthryth , Coenwulf 's heir and abbess of Minster @-@ in @-@ Thanet , until a final settlement was reached at a synod at Clofesho in 825 . 
 From 825 control of Kent fell to the kings of Wessex , and a compromise was reached between Archbishop Ceolnoth and King Egbert in 838 , confirmed by his son Æthelwulf in 839 , recognising Egbert and Æthelwulf as lay lords and protectors of monasteries and reserving spiritual lordship , particularly over election of abbots and abbesses , to bishops . One copy of the record of this agreement was preserved either at Reculver or at Lyminge . A factor leading to this abandonment of Wulfred 's strict policy may have been the increasing intensity of Viking attacks , which had begun in Kent in the late 8th century and had seen the ravaging of the Isle of Sheppey in 835 . An army of Vikings spent the winter of 851 on the Isle of Thanet and the same occurred on the Isle of Sheppey in 855 . Reculver , like most of the Kentish monasteries , lay in an exposed coastal location , and would have presented an obvious target for Vikings in search of treasure . By the 10th century the monastery at Reculver had ceased to be an important church in Kent and , together with its territory , it was in the hands of the kings of Wessex alone . In a charter of 949 King Eadred of England gave Reculver back to the archbishops of Canterbury , at which time the estate included Hoath and Herne , land at Sarre , in Thanet , and land at Chilmington , about 23 @.@ 5 miles ( 37 @.@ 8 km ) south @-@ west of Reculver . 
 = = Monastery to parish church = = 
 Reculver may have remained home to a religious community into the 10th century , despite its vulnerability to Viking attacks . It is possible that the abbot and community of Reculver took refuge from the Vikings in Canterbury , as the abbess and community of Lyminge did in 804 . A monk of Reculver named Ymar was recorded as a saint in the early 15th century by Thomas Elmham , who found the name in a martyrology , and wrote that Ymar was buried in St John ’ s church , Margate : Ymar was probably killed by Vikings in the 10th century , and hence regarded as a martyr . The Church in East Kent seems broadly to have " preserved its primary ... character against all the odds " , but evidence for the monastery at Reculver is lacking : by the 11th century the monastery had " dropped out of sight entirely " . The last abbot is recorded as <unk> : although it is unknown when he was abbot , it must have been after 890 – possibly 905 – when the name of Abbot <unk> last appears in Anglo @-@ Saxon charters . The church was last described as a monastery in about 1030 , when it was governed by a dean named <unk> and was home to monks , two of whom are named as <unk> and <unk> : these names indicate the presence of a religious community from the European continent , probably Flemings . This may have been nothing more than a temporary " resurgence of communal life at Reculver , at least for a period in the earlier eleventh century . ... [ Perhaps ] the old minster ... was provided as a refuge for a body of foreign clerics " . 
 By 1066 the monastery had become a parish church , with no baptismal function , and its territory had become part of the endowment of the archbishops of Canterbury . Domesday Book records the archbishop 's annual income from Reculver in 1086 as £ <unk> ( £ 42 @.@ 35 ) : this value can be compared with , for example , the £ 20 due to him from the manor of Maidstone , and £ 50 from the borough of Sandwich . Included in the Domesday account for Reculver , as well as the church , farmland , a mill , salt pans and a fishery , are 90 villeins and 25 bordars : these numbers can be multiplied four or five times to account for dependents , as they only represent " adult male heads of households " . 
 By the 13th century Reculver parish provided an ecclesiastical benefice of " exceptional wealth " , which led to disputes between lay and Church interests . In 1291 the <unk> of Pope Nicholas IV put the total income due to the rector and vicar of Reculver at about £ 130 . Included in the parish were chapels of ease at St Nicholas @-@ at @-@ Wade and All Saints ' Church , Shuart , both on the Isle of Thanet , and at Hoath and Herne . The parish was broken up in 1310 by Robert Winchelsey , archbishop of Canterbury from 1294 to 1313 , who created parishes from Reculver 's chapelries at Herne and , on the Isle of Thanet , St Nicholas @-@ at @-@ Wade and Shuart , in response to the difficulties posed by the distance between them and their mother church at Reculver , and a " steady increase in population " . At this time Shuart became part of St Nicholas @-@ at @-@ Wade parish , and its church was later demolished . However , St Mary 's Church , Reculver , continued to receive payments from the parishes of Herne and St Nicholas @-@ at @-@ Wade in the 19th century as a " token of subjection to Reculver " , as well as for the repair of St Mary 's Church , and the parish retained a perpetual curacy at Hoath until 1960 . 
 = = Enlargement and decline = = 
 = = = Enlargement = = = 
 The church building was considerably enlarged over time . The outer walls of the north and south porticus were extended to enclose the nave in the 8th century , forming a series of rooms , including chapels on both northern and southern sides , and a porch across the western side . The towers were added as part of an extension with a new west front in the late 12th century , when the internal walls of the rooms added in the 8th century were demolished , creating aisles on the north and south sides of the nave . In the 13th century the original apse was demolished and the chancel more than doubled in size , incorporating a triple east window with columns of Purbeck Marble , and in the 15th century north and south porches were added to the nave . A chantry in the church was endowed in 1354 in memory of Alicia de <unk> , and two more were endowed in 1371 by Thomas Niewe , a former vicar of Reculver . These chantries were suppressed in the reign of Edward VI , in 1548 or very early in 1549 . The towers were topped with spires by 1414 , since they are shown in an illustrated map drawn by Thomas Elmham in or before that year , and the north tower held a ring of bells . The addition of the towers , " an extraordinary investment ... for a parish church " , and the extent to which the church was enlarged in the Middle Ages , suggest that " a thriving township must have developed nearby . " Despite all the building work , the church retained many prominent Anglo @-@ Saxon features , and one in particular roused John Leland to " an enthusiasm which he seldom displayed " when he visited Reculver in 1540 : 
 Yn the <unk> of the <unk> ys one of the <unk> and the most <unk> crosse that ever I saw , a ix <unk> , as I <unk> , yn <unk> . It standeth lyke a <unk> <unk> . The base greate stone ys not wrought . The second stone being <unk> hath curiously wrought and <unk> the images of Christ , Peter , Paule , John and James , as I remember . Christ sayeth [ I am the Alpha and the Omega ] . Peter sayeth , [ You are Christ , son of the living God ] . The <unk> of the other <unk> when painted [ was in Roman capitals ] but now obliterated . The second stone is of the Passion . The third <unk> the xii Apostles . The iiii hath the image of Christ hanging and fastened with iiii <unk> and [ a support beneath the feet ] . the hiest part of the <unk> hath the figure of a crosse . 
 The high cross Leland is describing had been removed from the church by 1784 . Archaeologists examined what was believed to be the base of a 7th @-@ century cross in 1878 and the 1920s , and it has been suggested that the monastery at Reculver was originally built around it . The Reculver cross has been compared with the Anglo @-@ Saxon Ruthwell Cross – an open @-@ air preaching cross in Dumfries and Galloway , Scotland – and traces of paint on fragments of the Reculver cross show that its details were once multicoloured . Later , stylistic assessments indicate that the cross , carved from a re @-@ used Roman column , probably dates from the 8th century or the 9th , and that the stone believed to have been the base may have been the foundation for the original , 7th @-@ century altar . Leland also reported a wall painting of an unidentified bishop , on the north side of the church under an arch . Another Anglo @-@ Saxon item Leland found in the church was a gospel book : this was 
 'a very <unk> <unk> of the <unk> [ in Roman capital letters ] and in the <unk> thereof ys a <unk> stone thus <unk> : <unk> . <unk> ' . A gospel book written in ' Roman majuscules ' is unlikely to have been later than the early ninth century : perhaps it was an Italian import , such as the celebrated sixth @-@ century manuscript known as the ' Gospels of St Augustine ' ( <unk> 286 ) , but it could also have been a native product , of the seventh to ninth century , written in uncial or half @-@ uncial , such as the ' Royal Gospels ' from St Augustine 's ( BL Royal I E VI ) . It appears to have had a lavish binding decorated with a Roman cameo . 
 In its final form , the church consisted of a nave 67 feet ( 20 @.@ 4 m ) long by 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) wide , with north and south aisles of the same length and 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) wide , and a chancel 46 feet ( 14 m ) long by 23 feet ( 7 m ) wide . Including the spires , the towers were 106 feet ( 32 @.@ 3 m ) high , the surviving towers alone reaching 63 feet ( 19 @.@ 2 m ) . The towers measure 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) square internally , and are connected internally by a gallery which was about 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) above the floor of the nave . The overall length of the church was 120 feet ( 36 @.@ 6 m ) , and the breadth of the west front , which also survives , is 64 feet ( 19 @.@ 5 m ) . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 When Leland visited Reculver in 1540 , he noted that the coastline to the north had receded to within little more than a quarter of a mile ( 402 m ) of the " Towne [ which ] at this tyme [ was ] but Village lyke " . Soon after , in 1576 , William Lambarde described Reculver as " poore and simple " . In 1588 there were 165 communicants – people in Reculver parish taking part in services of holy communion at the church – and in 1640 there were 169 , but a map of about 1630 shows that the church then stood only about 500 feet ( 152 m ) from the shore . In January 1658 the local justices of the peace were petitioned concerning " encroachments of the sea ... [ which had ] since Michaelmas last [ 29 September 1657 ] encroached on the land near six rods [ 99 feet ( 30 m ) ] , and will doubtless do more harm " . The village 's failure to support two " beer shops " in the 1660s points clearly to a declining population , and the village was mostly abandoned around the end of the 18th century , its residents moving to Hillborough , about 1 @.@ 25 miles ( 2 km ) south @-@ west of Reculver but within Reculver parish . 
 The decline of the settlement led to the decline of the church . In 1776 Thomas <unk> described it as " full of solitude , and languished into decay " . In 1787 John Pridden noticed that the roofline of the nave must have been lowered at some time , judging by the tops of the east and west walls , and the fact that the tops of the two windows over the west door were at that time filled in with brick ; he also noted that the roof had been repaired in 1775 by A. Sayer , churchwarden , these details appearing embossed on replacement lead . But he described the church as " a weather @-@ beaten building ... <unk> away by the fury of the elements " , and a letter to The Gentleman 's Magazine in 1809 said that it was then somewhat dilapidated , with " trifling ... repairs such as have only tended to obliterate its once @-@ harmonizing beauties . " 
 = = Destruction = = 
 In the autumn of 1807 a northerly storm combined with a high tide to bring erosion of the cliff on which the church stood to within the churchyard , destroying " ten yards [ 9 @.@ 1 m ] of the wall around the churchyard , not ten yards from the foundation of the church " . Sea defences had been in place since at least 1783 , but although they had been costly to build their design had led to further undermining of the cliff . Two further schemes were devised by Sir Thomas Page and John Rennie to preserve the cliff by means of new sea defences , Rennie 's being estimated to cost £ 8 @,@ 277 . Instead , at a vestry meeting on 12 January 1808 , and at the instigation of the vicar , Christopher Naylor , it was decided that the church should be demolished . The decision was reached by vote among eight of the leading residents of Reculver and Hoath , including the vicar : the votes were evenly split , so the vicar used his casting vote in favour of demolition . Naylor applied to the Archbishop of Canterbury , Charles Manners @-@ Sutton , for permission to demolish , arguing that " in all human probability the <unk> [ would ] shortly be deprived of a place for the interment of their dead . " The archbishop commissioned neighbouring clergy and landowners to assess the situation , and they reported in March 1809 that the church should be demolished " to save the materials for the erection of another church . " 
 Demolition was begun in September 1809 using gunpowder , in what has been described as " an act of vandalism for which there can be few parallels even in the blackest records of the nineteenth century " : 
 the young clergyman of the parish , urged on by his Philistine mother , rashly <unk> his parishioners to demolish this shrine of early Christendom . This they duly did and all save the western towers , which still act as a landmark for shipping , was razed to the ground . 
 The demolition of this " shrine of early Christendom " , and exemplar of Anglo @-@ Saxon church architecture and sculpture , was otherwise thorough , and it is now represented only by the ruins on the site , material incorporated into a replacement parish church at Hillborough , fragments of the cross , and the two stone columns which had been part of the church 's triple arch . The columns and fragments of the cross are on display in Canterbury Cathedral . Two thousand tons of stone from the demolished church were sold and incorporated into the harbour wall at Margate , known as Margate Pier , which was completed in 1815 , and more than 40 tons of lead was stripped from the church and sold for £ 900 . Trinity House bought what was left of the structure from the parish for £ 100 , to ensure that the towers were preserved as a navigational aid , and built the first groynes , designed to protect the cliff on which the ruins stand . The spires had both been destroyed by storms by 1819 , when Trinity House replaced them with similarly shaped , open structures , topped by wind vanes . These structures remained until they were removed some time after 1928 . The ruins of the church , and the site of the Roman fort within which it was built , are now in the care of English Heritage , and the sea defences protecting the church continue to be maintained by Trinity House . 
 = = Archaeology = = 
 The first archaeological report on the then demolished church of St Mary was published by George Dowker in 1878 . He described finding the foundations of the apsidal chancel and of the columns that formed part of the triple chancel arch , and noted that the original floor of the church was of concrete , or opus signinum , more than 6 inches ( 15 cm ) thick . The floor had previously been described in 1782 , prior to the church 's demolition , as polished smooth and finished in red , a sample having been taken with difficulty using a pickaxe . Within the floor Dowker also found what he believed were the foundations for the stone cross described by Leland , and noted that the concrete floor appeared to have been laid around them . The floor of the chancel appeared to have been raised by about 10 @.@ 5 inches ( 26 @.@ 7 cm ) when the chancel was extended in the Early English period , and had been covered with encaustic tiles . Dowker also reported hearing from a Mr <unk> about the existence of a large , circular burial vault at the east end of the chancel , containing coffins arranged in a circle . 
 Further excavations were undertaken in the 1920s by C. R. Peers , who found that the nave of the original church had external doors on the north , south and west sides , and that the chancel had doors leading into the north and south porticus , which in turn had external doors on their eastern sides . Regarding the floor described by Dowker , Peers noted that the surface consisted of a thin layer of pounded brick , and believed that it was of the same date as the stone which Dowker described as the foundations for the stone cross . Excavations also revealed steps leading down to the burial vault reported by Dowker , although Peers did not refer to either the steps or the vault in his report . Extensions of the porticus to the west and around the original west front were dated to no more than 100 years after the church was first built , and Peers observed that these extensions had been given the same type of floor as the original church . Drawing comparisons with the 7th @-@ century chapel of St Peter @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Wall at Bradwell @-@ on @-@ Sea , in Essex , and the abbey of St Augustine at Canterbury , Peers suggested that the original church at Reculver probably had windows set high in the northern and southern walls of the nave . Areas of wall found by archaeologists but now missing above ground are marked on the site by strips of concrete edged with flint . 
 The church was found to have been free @-@ standing , so any other monastic buildings must have stood apart . In 1966 , archaeologists discovered the foundations of what they identified as probably a medieval building , rectangular and on an east @-@ west axis , with its eastern wall aligned with that of the church precinct , which it pre @-@ dated . Extending over and in contact with the western end of a Roman bath house , it stood a few yards east of the south @-@ eastern corner of the 13th @-@ century chancel . This building was not recorded by William Boys , who drew a plan of the Roman fort and the church in 1781 . Otherwise no such buildings have been found , but they may all have been in the area to the north of the church , which has been lost to the sea . In this connection Peers noted that the cloisters of the early Canterbury churches of St Augustine 's and Christ Church were both on their northern sides . A building that stood west @-@ northwest of the church may have had an Anglo @-@ Saxon doorway and the dimensions of an Anglo @-@ Saxon church , and had " the appearance of having been part of some monastic erection " . It was demolished after the sea weakened its foundations during storms in the winter of 1782 . Leland reported another building outside the churchyard , where it was believed that a parish church had stood while the main church at Reculver was still a monastery : this building , formerly a chapel dedicated to St James , was later known as the " chapel @-@ house " , and stood in the north @-@ eastern corner of the fort until it collapsed into the sea on 13 October 1802 . Peers noted further that it seems to have had brick arches . 
 = = St John 's Cathedral , Parramatta = = 
 The design of the twin towers , spires and west front of St John 's Cathedral , Parramatta , in Sydney , Australia , which were added in 1817 – 1819 , is based on those of St Mary 's Church at Reculver . Efforts to save St Mary 's Church were still under way when Governor Lachlan Macquarie and his wife Elizabeth left England for Australia in 1809 . Elizabeth Macquarie asked John Watts , the governor 's aide @-@ de @-@ camp from 1814 to 1819 , to design the towers for St John 's Cathedral , and these , together with its west front , are the oldest remaining parts of an Anglican church in Australia , and are on the oldest site of continuous Christian worship there . In 1990 a stone from Reculver was presented to St John 's Cathedral by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England , now English Heritage . 
 = Princess Helena of the United Kingdom = 
 Princess Helena ( Helena Augusta Victoria ; Princess Christian of Schleswig @-@ Holstein by marriage ; 25 May 1846 – 9 June 1923 ) was the third daughter and fifth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert . 
 Helena was educated by private tutors chosen by her father and his close friend and adviser , Baron Stockmar . Her childhood was spent with her parents , travelling between the variety of royal residences in Britain . The intimate atmosphere of the royal court came to an end on 14 December 1861 , when her father died and her mother entered a period of intense mourning . In the early 1860s , Helena began a flirtation with Prince Albert 's German librarian , Carl Ruland . Although the nature of the relationship is largely unknown , Helena 's romantic letters to Ruland survive . After the Queen found out in 1863 , she dismissed Ruland , who returned to his native Germany . Three years later , on 5 July 1866 , Helena married the impoverished German Prince Christian of Schleswig @-@ Holstein . The couple remained in Britain , in calling distance of the Queen , who liked to have her daughters nearby , and Helena along with her youngest sister , Princess Beatrice , became the Queen 's unofficial secretary . However , after Queen Victoria 's death on 22 January 1901 , Helena saw relatively little of her surviving siblings . 
 Helena was the most active member of the royal family , carrying out an extensive programme of royal engagements at a time when royalty was not expected to appear often in public . She was also an active patron of charities , and was one of the founding members of the Red Cross . She was founding president of the Royal School of Needlework , and president of the Royal British Nurses ' Association . As president of the latter , she was a strong supporter of nurse registration against the advice of Florence Nightingale . She became the first member of her family to celebrate her 50th wedding anniversary in 1916 , but her husband died a year later . Helena outlived him by six years , and died aged 77 at Schomberg House on 9 June 1923 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Helena was born at Buckingham Palace , the official royal residence in London , on 25 May 1846 , the day after her mother 's 27th birthday . She was the third daughter and fifth child of the reigning British monarch , Queen Victoria , and her husband Prince Albert of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha . Albert reported to his brother , Ernest II , the Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha , that Helena " came into this world quite blue , but she is quite well now " . He added that the Queen " suffered longer and more than the other times and she will have to remain very quiet to recover . " Albert and Victoria chose the names Helena Augusta Victoria . The German nickname for Helena was <unk> , later shortened to <unk> , the name by which members of the royal family invariably referred to Helena . As the daughter of the sovereign , Helena was styled Her Royal Highness The Princess Helena from birth . Helena was baptised on 25 July 1846 at the private chapel at Buckingham Palace . Her godparents were The Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg @-@ Strelitz , her first cousin once @-@ removed by marriage ; The Duchess of Orléans ( Hélène , for whom The Queen 's mother The Duchess of Kent stood proxy ) ; and The Duchess of Cambridge . 
 Helena was a lively and outspoken child , and reacted against brotherly teasing by punching the bully on the nose . Her early talents included drawing . Lady Augusta Stanley , a lady @-@ in @-@ waiting to the Queen , commented favourably on the three @-@ year @-@ old Helena 's artwork . 
 Like her sisters , she could play the piano to a high standard at an early age . Other interests included science and technology , shared by her father Prince Albert , and horseback riding and boating , two of her favourite childhood occupations . However , Helena became a middle daughter following the birth of Princess Louise in 1848 , and her abilities were overshadowed by her more artistic sisters . 
 = = Death of Prince Albert = = 
 Helena 's father , Prince Albert , died on 14 December 1861 . The Queen was devastated , and ordered her household , along with her daughters , to move from Windsor to Osborne House , the Queen 's Isle of Wight residence . Helena 's grief was also profound , and she wrote to a friend a month later : " What we have lost nothing can ever replace , and our grief is most , most bitter ... I adored Papa , I loved him more than anything on earth , his word was a most sacred law , and he was my help and adviser ... These hours were the happiest of my life , and now it is all , all over . " 
 The Queen relied on her second eldest daughter Princess Alice as an unofficial secretary , but Alice needed an assistant of her own . Though Helena was the next eldest , she was considered unreliable by Victoria because of her inability to go long without bursting into tears . Therefore , Louise was selected to assume the role in her place , Alice was married to Prince Louis of Hesse in 1862 , after which Helena assumed the role — described as the " crutch " of her mother 's old age by one biographer — at her mother 's side . In this role , she carried out minor secretarial tasks , such as writing the Queen 's letters , helping her with political correspondence , and providing her with company .

 = = = Marriage controversy = = = 
 Princess Helena began an early flirtation with her father 's former librarian , Carl Ruland , following his appointment to the Royal Household on the recommendation of Baron Stockmar in 1859 . He was trusted enough to teach German to Helena 's brother , the young Prince of Wales , and was described by the Queen as " useful and able " . When the Queen discovered that Helena had grown romantically attached to a royal servant , he was promptly dismissed back to his native Germany , and he never lost the Queen 's hostility . 
 Following Ruland 's departure in 1863 , the Queen looked for a husband for Helena . However , as a middle child , the prospect of a powerful alliance with a European royal house was low . Her appearance was also a concern , as by the age of fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky , dowdy and double @-@ chinned . Furthermore , Victoria insisted that Helena 's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen , thus keeping her daughter nearby . Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig @-@ Holstein ; however , the match was politically awkward , and caused a severe breach within the royal family . 
 Schleswig and Holstein were two territories fought over between Prussia and Denmark during the First and Second Schleswig Wars . In the latter , Prussia and Austria defeated Denmark , but the duchies were claimed by Austria for the Prince Christian 's family . However , following the Austro @-@ Prussian War , in which Prussia invaded and occupied the duchies , they became Prussian , but the title Duke of Schleswig @-@ Holstein was still claimed by Prince Christian 's family . 
 The marriage , therefore , horrified King Christian IX of Denmark 's daughter , Alexandra , Princess of Wales , who exclaimed : " The Duchies belong to Papa . " Alexandra found support in her husband , his brother Prince Alfred , and his second sister , Princess Alice , who openly accused her mother of sacrificing Helena 's happiness for the Queen 's convenience . Alice also argued that it would reduce the already low popularity of her sister , the crown princess of Prussia , at the German court in Berlin . However , and unexpectedly , the Prussian crown princess , who had been a personal friend of Christian 's family for many years , ardently supported the proposed alliance . More than fifteen years later , in February 1881 , Helena 's nephew Kaiser Wilhelm II ( son of the Prussian crown princess ) would marry Christian 's brother 's daughter Augusta Victoria of Schleswig @-@ Holstein . 
 Despite the political controversies and their age difference — he was fifteen years her senior — Helena was happy with Christian and was determined to marry him . As a younger son of a non @-@ reigning duke , the absence of any foreign commitments allowed him to remain permanently in Britain — the Queen 's primary concern — and she declared the marriage would go ahead . Helena and Christian were actually third cousins in descent from Frederick , Prince of Wales . Relations between Helena and Alexandra remained strained , and Alexandra was unprepared to accept Christian ( who was also a third cousin to Alexandra in descent from King Frederick V of Denmark ) as either a cousin or brother @-@ in @-@ law . The Queen never forgave the Princess of Wales for accusations of possessiveness , and wrote of the <unk> shortly afterwards : " Bertie is most affectionate and kind but Alix [ pet name for Alexandra ] is by no means what she ought to be . It will be long , if ever , before she regains my confidence . " 
 = = = Engagement and wedding = = = 
 The engagement was declared on 5 December 1865 , and despite the Prince of Wales 's initial refusal to attend , Princess Alice intervened , and the wedding was a happy occasion . The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle , albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George 's Chapel , and relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back . The main participants filed into the chapel to the sound of Beethoven 's Triumphal March , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George , the Duke of Cambridge , who had a sudden gout attack . Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters , Prince Edward of Saxe @-@ Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig @-@ Holstein , and Helena was given away by her mother , who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids . Christian looked older than he was , and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle . Indeed , when he was first summoned to Britain , he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters . The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House , before honeymooning in Paris , Interlaken and Genoa . 
 = = = Married life = = = 
 Helena and Christian were devoted to each other , and led a quiet life in comparison to Helena 's sisters . Following their marriage , they took up residence at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park , the traditional residence of the Ranger of Windsor Great Park , the honorary position bestowed on Christian by the Queen . When staying in London , they lived at the Belgian Suite in Buckingham Palace . The couple had six children : Christian Victor in 1867 , Albert in 1869 , and Princesses Helena Victoria and Marie Louise in 1870 and 1872 respectively . Their last two sons died early ; Harald died eight days after his birth in 1876 , and an unnamed son was stillborn in 1877 . Princess Louise , Helena 's sister , commissioned the French sculptor Jules Dalou to sculpt a memorial to Helena 's dead infants . 
 The Christians were granted a parliamentary annuity of £ 6000 a year , which the Queen requested in person . In addition , a dower of £ 30 @,@ 000 was settled upon , and the Queen gave the couple £ 100 @,@ 000 , which yielded an income of about £ 4000 a year . As well as that of Ranger of Windsor Park , Christian was given the honorary position of High Steward of Windsor , and was made a Royal Commissioner for the Great Exhibition of 1851 . However , he was often an absentee figurehead at the meetings , instead passing his time playing with his dog Corrie , feeding his numerous pigeons , and embarking on hunting excursions . 
 Helena , as promised , lived close to the Queen , and both she and Beatrice performed duties for her . Beatrice , whom Victoria had groomed for the main role at her side , carried out the more important duties , and Helena took on the more minor matters that Beatrice did not have time to do . In later years , Helena was assisted by her unmarried daughter , Helena Victoria , to whom the Queen dictated her journal in the last months of her life . 
 Helena 's health was not robust , and she was addicted to the drugs opium and laudanum . However , the Queen did not believe that Helena was really ill , accusing her of hypochondria encouraged by an indulgent husband . Queen Victoria wrote to her daughter Victoria , Crown Princess of Prussia , complaining that Helena was inclined to " coddle herself ( and Christian too ) and to give way in everything that the great object of her doctors and nurse is to rouse her and make her think less of herself and of her confinement " . Not all of her health scares were brought on by hypochondria ; in 1869 , she had to cancel her trip to Balmoral Castle when she became ill at the railway station . In 1870 , she was suffering from severe rheumatism and problems with her joints . In July 1871 , she suffered from congestion in her lungs , an illness severe enough to appear in the Court Circular , which announced that her illness caused " much anxiety to members of the royal family " . In 1873 , she was forced to recuperate in France as a result of illness , and in the 1880s she travelled to Germany to see an oculist for her eyes . 
 = = Activities = = 
 = = = Nursing = = = 
 Helena had a firm interest in nursing , and became President of the British Nurses ' Association ( RBNA ) upon its foundation in 1887 . In 1891 , it received the prefix " Royal " , and received the Royal Charter the following year . She was a strong supporter of nurse registration , an issue that was opposed by both Florence Nightingale and leading public figures . In a speech Helena made in 1893 , she made clear that the RBNA was working towards " improving the education and status of those devoted and self @-@ sacrificing women whose whole lives have been devoted to tending the sick , the suffering , and the dying " . In the same speech , she warned about opposition and misrepresentation they had encountered . Although the RBNA was in favour of registration as a means of enhancing and guaranteeing the professional status of trained nurses , its incorporation with the Privy Council allowed it to maintain a list rather than a formal register of nurses . 
 Following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 , the new Queen , Alexandra , insisted on replacing Helena as President of the Army Nursing Service . This gave rise to a further breach between the royal ladies , with King Edward VII caught in the middle between his sister and his wife . Lady Roberts , a courtier , wrote to a friend : " matters were sometimes very difficult and not always pleasant . " However , in accordance with rank , Helena agreed to resign in Alexandra 's favour , and she retained presidency of the Army Nursing Reserve . Though thought to be merely an artefact created by society ladies , Helena exercised an efficient and autocratic regime — " if anyone ventures to disagree with Her Royal Highness she has simply said , ' It is my wish , that is sufficient . ' " 
 The RBNA gradually went into decline following the Nurses Registration Act 1919 ; after six failed attempts between 1904 and 1918 , the British parliament passed the bill allowing formal nurse registration . What resulted was the Royal College of Nursing ( RCN ) , and the RBNA lost membership and dominance . Helena supported the proposed amalgamation of the RBNA with the new RCN , but that proved unsuccessful when the RBNA pulled out of the negotiations . However , she remained active in other nursing organisations , and was president of the Isle of Wight , Windsor and Great Western Railway branches of the Order of St. John . In this position , she personally signed and presented many thousands of certificates of proficiency in nursing . 
 = = = Needlework = = = 
 Helena was also active in the promotion of needlework , and became the first president of the newly established School of Art Needlework in 1872 ; in 1876 , it acquired the " royal " prefix , becoming the Royal School of Needlework . In Helena 's words , the objective of the school was : " first , to revive a beautiful art which had been well @-@ nigh lost ; and secondly , through its revival , to provide employment for gentlewomen who were without means of a suitable livelihood . " As with her other organisations , she was an active president , and worked to keep the school on an even level with other schools . She personally wrote to Royal Commissioners requesting money ; for example , in 1895 , she requested and acquired £ 30 @,@ 000 for erecting a building for the school in South Kensington . Her royal status helped its promotion , and she held Thursday afternoon tea parties at the school for society ladies , who wanted to be seen in the presence of royal personages such as Princess Helena . When the Christmas Bazaar was held , she acted as chief saleswoman , generating long queues of people anxious to be served personally by her . 
 Helena was anxious to help children and the unemployed , and began hosting free dinners for their benefit at the Windsor Guildhall . She presided over two of these dinners , in February and March 1886 , and over 3000 meals were served to children and unemployed men during the harsh Winter that year . Through her charitable activities , she became popular with the people ; a contemporary author , C. W. Cooper , wrote that " the poor of Windsor worshipped her " . 
 = = Writing = = 
 Among Helena 's other interests was writing , especially translation . In 1867 , when the first biography of her father , the Prince Consort was written , the author , Sir Charles Grey , notes that the Prince 's letters were translated ( from German to English ) by Helena " with surprising fidelity " . Other translations followed , and in 1887 she published a translation of The Memoirs of Wilhelmine , Margravine of Bayreuth . It was noted by the Saturday Review that Helena wrote an English version that was thoroughly alive , with a sound dictionary translation and a high accuracy in spirit . Her final translation was undertaken in 1882 , on a German booklet called First Aid to the Injured , originally published by Christian 's brother @-@ in @-@ law . It was republished several times until 1906 . 
 = = = Bergsträsser affair = = = 
 A copyright issue arose after the publication of letters written by Helena 's sister , Princess Alice . In Germany , an edition of Alice 's letters was published in 1883 , by a Darmstadt clergyman called Dr. Carl Sell , who chose a selection of her letters made available to him by the Queen . When it was done , Helena wrote to Sell and requested permission to publish the German text into English , and it was granted , but without the knowledge of the publisher , Dr. Bergsträsser . In December 1883 Helena wrote to Sir Theodore Martin , a favoured royal biographer , informing him that Bergsträsser was claiming copyright of Alice 's letters , and on that basis was demanding a delay in the publication of the English edition . Martin acted as an intermediary between Helena and Bergsträsser , who claimed to have received many offers from English publishers , and that the chosen one would expect a high honorarium . 
 Bergsträsser was persuaded to drop his demand for a delay in publishing , and modify his copyright claims in return for a lump sum of money . However , the Queen and Helena refused , claiming that the copyright actually belonged to the Queen , and that only Sell 's original preface was open to negotiation . The royal ladies considered Bergsträsser 's claims " unjustified if not impertinent " , and would not communicate with him directly . Eventually , Bergsträsser came to Britain in January 1884 , willing to accept £ 100 for the first 3000 copies and a further £ 40 for each subsequent thousand copies sold . Martin chose the publisher John Murray , who after further negotiations with Bergsträsser , printed the first copies in mid @-@ 1884 . It sold out almost immediately ; but for the second edition , Murray replaced Sell 's biographical sketch of Princess Alice with the 53 @-@ page memoir written by Helena . The problem of royalties to Sell was thus avoided , and the fact that Helena gave her name to the memoir to her sister attracted greater interest in the book . 
 = = After Victoria = = 
 = = = Edwardian period = = = 
 Helena 's favourite son , Prince Christian Victor , died in 1900 , followed shortly by her mother , Queen Victoria , at Osborne House on 22 January 1901 . The new King , King Edward VII , did not have close ties with his surviving sisters , with the exception of Princess Louise . Helena 's nephew , Prince Alexander of Battenberg ( later Marquess of Carisbrooke ) recorded that Queen Alexandra was jealous of the royal family , and would not invite her sisters @-@ in @-@ law to Sandringham . Moreover , Alexandra never fully reconciled herself to Helena and Christian following their marriage controversy in the 1860s . 
 Helena saw relatively little of her surviving siblings , and continued her role as a support to the monarchy and a campaigner for the many charities she represented . She and Christian led a quiet life , but did carry out a few royal engagements . On one such occasion , the elderly couple represented the King at the silver wedding anniversary , in 1906 , of Kaiser Wilhelm II ( Helena 's nephew ) and his wife Augusta Victoria ( Christian 's niece ) . During the Edwardian period , Helena visited the grave of her son , Prince Christian Victor , who died in 1900 following a bout with malaria while serving in the Second Boer War . She was met by South African Prime Minister Louis Botha , but Jan Smuts refused to meet her , partly because he was bitter that South Africa had lost the war and partly because his son had died in a British concentration camp . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 Edward VII died in 1910 , and the First World War began four years after his death . Helena devoted her time to nursing , and her daughter , Princess Marie Louise , recorded in her memoirs that requests for news of loved ones reached Helena and her sisters . It was decided that the letters should be forwarded to Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden , as Sweden was neutral during the war . It was during the war that Helena and Christian celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1916 , and despite the fact that Britain and Germany were at war , the Kaiser sent a congratulatory telegram to his aunt and uncle through the Crown Princess of Sweden . King George V and Queen Mary were present when the telegram was received , and the King remarked to Helena 's daughter , Marie Louise , that her former husband , Prince <unk> of Anhalt , did her a service when he turned her out . When Marie Louise said she would have run away to Britain if she was still married , the King said , " with a twinkle in his eye " , that he would have had to intern her . 
 In 1917 , in response to the wave of anti @-@ German feeling that surrounded the war , George V changed the family name from Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha to Windsor . He also disposed of his family 's German titles and styles , so Christian , Helena and their daughters simply became Prince and Princess Christian ; Princess Helena Victoria and Marie Louise with no territorial designation . Helena 's surviving son , Albert , fought on the side of the Prussians , though he made it clear that he would not fight against his mother 's country . In the same year , on 8 October , Prince Christian died at Schomberg House . Her last years were spent arguing with Commissioners , who tried to turn her out of Schomberg and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of running her households . They failed , as clear evidence of her right to live in those residences for life was shown . 
 Princess Helena , Princess Christian of Schleswig @-@ Holstein , died at Schomberg House on 9 June 1923 . Her funeral , described as a " magnificently stage @-@ managed scene " by her biographer Seweryn <unk> , was headed by King George V. The regiment of her favourite son , Prince Christian Victor , lined the steps of St. George 's Chapel at Windsor Castle . Although originally interred in the Royal Vault at St George 's on 15 June 1923 , her body was reburied at the Royal Burial Ground , Frogmore , a few miles from Windsor , after its consecration on 23 October 1928 .

 Helena was devoted to nursing , and took the lead at the charitable organisations she represented . She was also an active campaigner , and wrote letters to newspapers and magazines promoting the interests of nurse registration . Her royal status helped to promote the publicity and society interest that surrounded organisations such as the Royal British Nurses ' Association . The RBNA still survives today with Baroness Cox as president . Emily Williamson founded the <unk> 's Employment Association in Manchester ; one of the projects which came out of this group was the Princess Christian Training College for Nurses , in Fallowfield , Manchester . 
 In appearance , Helena was described by John Van der <unk> as plump and dowdy ; and in temperament , as placid , and business @-@ like , with an authoritarian spirit . On one occasion , during a National Dock Strike , the Archbishop of Canterbury composed a prayer hoping for its prompt end . Helena arrived at the church , examined her service sheet , and in a voice described by her daughter as " the penetrating royal family whisper , which carried farther than any megaphone " , remarked : " That prayer won 't settle any strike . " Her appearance and personality was criticised in the letters and journals of Queen Victoria , and biographers followed her example . However , Helena 's daughter , Princess Marie Louise , described her as : 
 very lovely , with wavy brown hair , a beautiful little straight nose , and lovely amber @-@ coloured eyes ... She was very talented : played the piano <unk> , had a distinct gift for drawing and painting in water @-@ colours ... Her outstanding gift was loyalty to her friends ... She was brilliantly clever , had a wonderful head for business ... 
 Music was one of her passions ; in her youth she played the piano with Charles Hallé , and Jenny Lind and Clara Butt were among her personal friends . Her determination to carry out a wide range of public duties won her widespread popularity . She twice represented her mother at Drawing Rooms , where guests were instructed to present themselves to Helena as if they were presenting themselves to the Queen . 
 Helena was closest to her brother , Prince Alfred , who considered her his favourite sister . Though described by contemporaries as fearfully devoted to the Queen , to the point that she did not have a mind of her own , she actively campaigned for women 's rights , a field the Queen abhorred . Nevertheless , both she and Beatrice remained closest to the Queen , and Helena remained close to her mother 's side until the latter 's death . Her name was the last to be written in the Queen 's seventy @-@ year @-@ old journal .

 Miguel de Azcuénaga ( June 4 , 1754 – December 19 , 1833 ) was an Argentine brigadier . Educated in Spain , at the University of Seville , <unk> began his military career in the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata and became a member of the Primera Junta , the first autonomous government of modern Argentina . He was shortly exiled because of his support to the minister Mariano Moreno , and returned to Buenos Aires when the First Triumvirate replaced the Junta . He held several offices since then , most notably being the first Governor intendant of Buenos Aires after the May Revolution . He died at his country house ( the modern Quinta de Olivos ) in 1833 .

 = = = Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata = = = 
 Miguel de Azcuénaga was born in Buenos Aires on June 4 , 1754 . He was the son of Vicente de Azcuénaga <unk> , a Spanish businessman from Biscay , and María Rosa de Basavilbaso y <unk> , from Buenos Aires . The Azcuénaga @-@ Basavilbaso had 4 sons and 3 daughters . Miguel de Azcuénaga was sent to Spain at an early age , to complete his elementary studies in Málaga and then attend the University of Seville . He returned to Buenos Aires in 1774 , and made a new journey to Spain to oversee the business of his father . 
 He began his military career in the artillery of Buenos Aires , during the Spanish – Portuguese War , staying in that unit until the signing of the First Treaty of San Ildefonso that incorporated the Banda Oriental to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata . With the war concluded , he became a regidor of the Buenos Aires Cabildo . He took the arms again in 1778 , during an attack of the natives , and directed the operations at the fort in San Miguel del Monte . As Spain fought the American Revolutionary War , it was feared that Britain may launch a counteroffensive against the Spanish colonies . Azcuénaga led an artillery unit with 4 cannons in 1781 , but no British attack took place . 
 He was appointed to several offices within the Buenos Aires Cabildo in the 1781 @-@ 1794 period . On April 7 , 1789 , he helped a number of shoemakers to establish a guild . Although there were several in Spain , no guild constitution from Spain was used as a model . He promoted the pavement of the streets , and the improvement of the buildings . Supported by the viceroy Nicolás Antonio de Arredondo , he collected $ 8 @,@ 000 and provided 500 cattle to mine rocks from the Martín García Island for this work . He married his cousin Justa Rufina de Basavilbaso y <unk> on February 6 , 1795 . 
 He was appointed lieutenant colonel in 1796 , leading a local militia from that year to 1802 . When he left , he granted all his military wages from that period to the soldiers of his unit . He was appointed colonel on march 24 , 1802 , and donated $ 2 @,@ 435 for the clothing of the soldiers . He further donated $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 to build a navy , along with Juan Larrea and Domingo Matheu . He fought in the 1806 British invasions of the Río de la Plata , leading a resistance in the Gálvez bridge . He stood for 20 hours , with only 400 soldiers , against an overwhelming British force . He managed to escape with 50 soldiers , and aided the brigadier <unk> de la Quintana . 
 = = = Argentine War of Independence = = = 
 The Peninsular War in Spain , along with the capture of the king Ferdinand VII and the fall of the Junta of Seville , escalated political disputes in Buenos Aires that led to the May Revolution . Several criollos thought that the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros , appointed by the fallen Junta , did not have legitimacy , and requested an open cabildo to discuss it . Azcuénaga attended it , and voted for the creation of a Junta with deputies from all the provinces , with the Cabildo ruling in the interregnum . However , the majority agreed with the creation of a junta , but with another junta of people from Buenos ruling during in the meantime . The viceroy tried to stay in government as president of the Junta , which was resisted by the criollos . Azcuénaga lend his house to their secret meetings . Azcuénaga was appointed as a member of the new Primera Junta , and promoted to brigadier . The reasons of Azcuénaga 's inclusion in the Junta are unclear , as with all its members . A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists , Alzaguists , the military and the clergy ; besides being from the armed forces , Azcuénaga had close ties with the rich people of the city . 
 The Junta suffered from internal conflicts between the conservatives ( led by Cornelio Saavedra ) and the liberals ( led by Mariano Moreno ) . Azcuénaga was aligned with Moreno . Although he opposed the expansion of the Junta into the Junta Grande , he voted for the proposal , perhaps under pressure of Saavedra . Mariano Moreno resigned in December , and all his supporters were forced to resign in May 1811 . Azcuénaga was exiled to the Mendoza Province , and lost his military rank . His wife requested instead an exile to the closer Luján , which was declined . The Junta was replaced by the First Triumvirate . Azcuénaga still had a positive image among his peers , and the political change allowed his return and the restitution of his rank . However , a mistake with the documentation gave him only the rank of colonel ; he could only retrieve his rank of Brigadier in 1814 . He was appointed Governor intendant of Buenos Aires ( ruling over the province , whereas the Triumvirate had a national authority ) . 
 The Assembly of the Year XIII replaced the Triumvirate with an <unk> head of state , the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata . Gervasio Antonio de Posadas was appointed Supreme Director , and Azcuénaga selected as one of his five advisors . In 1816 the Cabildo appointed him as protector of the freedom of the press . He became a member of the Congress of Tucumán in 1818 , when it was moved from San Miguel de Tucumán to Buenos Aires . He was elected vice @-@ president of the Congress in September and reelected in May 1819 . The defeat of Buenos Aires in 1820 at the Battle of Cepeda , part of the Argentine Civil Wars , led to the closing of the Congress . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 In 1828 , aged 74 , he took part in the peace negotiations with the Empire of Brazil after the end of the Argentine @-@ Brazilian War , which led to the creation of the state of Uruguay . Those negotiations took place in Montevideo . He managed the economy in 1829 and 1830 , and became a deputy in 1831 and 1832 . His fellow deputies pointed that he attended all the legislative sessions , despite of his old age . 
 Azcuénaga died at his home on December 19 , 1833 . The governor Juan José Viamonte ordered the construction of a cenotaph at the Northern Cemetery ( modern La Recoleta Cemetery ) , which is still in place today . The official decree stated that " the noteworthy services he gave to the nation at all times the brigadier general Miguel de Azcuénaga , and particularly in the days of the glorious independence , require a demonstration that takes to posterity the name of this patriot , and keeps the memory of his civic virtues " . 
 Azcuénaga 's country house was built during the establishment of Buenos Aires in 1580 by Juan de Garay . After several generations it was inherited by Justa Rufina Basavilbaso , Azcuénaga 's wife . Further generations of the family ( with ancestry of the viceroy Antonio de Olaguer y <unk> as well ) inherited it , until Carlos <unk> Olaguer gave it to the Argentine state in 1913 , to be used as an official residence of the President of Argentina . It was renamed as Quinta de Olivos , and it was used by all Argentine presidents since Agustín Pedro Justo .

Cuming had been the first man to fly a jet aircraft in Australia ( a Gloster Meteor in 1946 ) , and had previously commanded the RAAF 's Aircraft Research and Development Unit ( ARDU ) . In announcing his appointment to command No. 1 Long Range Flight , Minister for Air William McMahon described Cuming as the " RAAF 's outstanding test pilot " . 
 The flight received its first aircraft , the Canberra bomber A84 @-@ 307 , on 15 June 1953 . This aircraft had been built in Britain as the RAAF 's first Canberra , and was flown to Australia by Wing Commander Cuming in July 1951 . The journey had been completed in 21 hours and 41 minutes , setting an unofficial record for the route . The flight 's second aircraft , A84 @-@ 201 , arrived on 1 July . This was the first Australian @-@ built Canberra and was assigned to No. 1 Long Range Flight shortly after being completed . The second Australian @-@ built Canberra , A84 @-@ 202 , was also assigned to the flight in August . All three aircraft were modified for their specialised role by No. 1 Aircraft Depot . These modifications included fitting distance @-@ measuring equipment in each of the aircraft and three fuel tanks in their bomb bays . Wing Commander Cuming told journalists in August that the Australian @-@ made Canberras were preferred to the British models on the grounds of national prestige and because the aircraft were fitted with superior navigation equipment . A84 @-@ 307 was retained by the flight , however , as the reserve aircraft to be used if modifications to A84 @-@ 202 were not completed in time for the race . 
 No. 1 Long Range Flight undertook intensive training in the lead @-@ up to the race . This involved making regular long range return flights between Laverton and Ceylon , Singapore and Christchurch via various air bases in Australia . These exercises were used to establish fuel consumption rates and practice the refuelling and navigation practices that would be used in the race . As part of this training the flight broke many Australian and New Zealand air speed records , setting the fastest time for crossing the Tasman Sea during a flight between RAAF Base Amberley and Christchurch on 16 August . An aeronautical engineer was attached to No. 1 Long Range Flight from the Department of Air to calculate the optimum route for the Canberras to take . On 2 September Cuming and Raw visited the Government Aircraft Factories facility at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne to thank the workers who were building Canberra bombers for the RAAF .

 Selected as Australia 's entries in the London @-@ to @-@ Christchurch air race , A84 @-@ 201 and A84 @-@ 202 departed Laverton bound for the UK on 10 September 1953 , and arrived at RAF Lyneham on the 16th of the month . Detachments of No. 1 Long Range Flight ground crew were stationed in the UK , Bahrain , Ratmalana Airport in Ceylon , Cocos Island in the Indian Ocean and Christchurch . The first of these detachments departed Australia for the UK on 9 September . The detachments that were stationed at Bahrain and Ratmalana Airport left Laverton on board a RAAF Dakota transport on 25 September . Each of the detachments was led by a RAAF navigator , whose main role was to develop a flight plan for the next leg of the race and provide it to the aircrew to minimise the time they spent on the ground . The RAAF also supported its entrants and the aircraft from other countries by deploying an air traffic control team and specialised radar equipment to Christchurch , as well as stationing P @-@ 2 Neptune long @-@ range patrol aircraft at Cocos Island , Perth and RAAF Base East Sale for search @-@ and @-@ rescue coverage . The Royal Australian Navy aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance and destroyer HMAS Bataan were stationed in the Tasman Sea to provide weather reports for the race . 
 The London @-@ to @-@ Christchurch air race began on 9 October . A84 @-@ 202 , which was piloted by Wing Commander Cuming , took off from London Airport at 3 : 50 am . A84 @-@ 201 , piloted by Squadron Leader Raw , followed five minutes later . Each of the Canberras was also manned by a co @-@ pilot and a navigator . The aircraft flew separately to Bahrain , where they made a brief refuelling stop , then continued to Ratmalana Airport and Cocos Island where they refuelled again . One of A84 @-@ 202 's tyres burst while landing at Cocos Island , putting it out of the race . At this time A84 @-@ 202 was two minutes ahead of A84 @-@ 201 and 15 minutes ahead of any of the entrants from the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . 
 A84 @-@ 201 continued and next landed at RAAF Woomera Airfield in South Australia to refuel . Its nose wheel locked up while landing due to ice accretion , but this was able to be repaired and the aircraft took off at 0 : 19 am , local time . The repairs delayed the aircraft by 83 minutes , however . A84 @-@ 201 arrived at Harewood Airport in Christchurch at 4 : 32 am local time , and placed second in the race with a flight time of 22 hours and 29 minutes . The winning aircraft , RAF Canberra <unk> , completed its flight in 22 hours and 25 minutes . The £ 3 @,@ 000 prize money awarded to Raw for placing second was later donated to the RAAF Welfare Trust Fund . 
 On 10 October two replacement tyres were flown to Cocos Island to repair A84 @-@ 202 . The aircraft departed on the 12th of the month and flew to Christchurch via Laverton ; its total flying time was 22 hours and 23 @.@ 5 minutes . Cuming later told journalists that A84 @-@ 202 's crew had drunk beer and gone for a swim while waiting for their aircraft to be repaired . Both Canberras later flew demonstration flights over Harewood Airport and RNZAF Base <unk> and returned to Laverton on 19 October . The aircraft were transferred to No. 1 Aircraft <unk> on 2 November to be returned to standard configuration , and No. 1 Long Range Flight 's overseas detachments had all returned to Australia by 6 November . The flight was disbanded on the 16th of the month . The total cost of the RAAF 's entry in the air race was £ 50 @,@ 000 , which Minister McMahon claimed was a " bargain rate " given the results of the air force 's participation . 
 After No. 1 Long Range Flight was disbanded , Wing Commander Cuming returned to the ARDU . He was subsequently appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) on 31 December 1953 for leading the flight and participating in the London @-@ to @-@ Christchurch air race . Squadron Leader Raw was also awarded the Air Force Cross for his role in the race , the decoration being presented to him by Queen Elizabeth II at Brisbane on 10 March 1954 . Raw had assumed command of No. 2 Squadron on 18 December ; this was the first RAAF squadron to be equipped with Canberra bombers . Flight Lieutenant Francis Noel Davies , who had been Raw 's co @-@ pilot during the race , and two other airmen were killed on 16 June 1954 when A84 @-@ 202 crashed near Amberley . Wing Commander Cuming presided over the four @-@ man court of inquiry which investigated the cause of this accident . As of May 2011 , A84 @-@ 201 was a gate guard at RAAF Base Amberley . 
 = Mount St. Helens = 
 Mount St. Helens or <unk> @-@ Clough ( known as <unk> 'la to the indigenous Cowlitz people , and Loowit to the Klickitat ) is an active stratovolcano located in Skamania County , Washington , in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States . It is 96 miles ( 154 km ) south of Seattle , Washington , and 50 miles ( 80 km ) northeast of Portland , Oregon . Mount St. Helens takes its English name from the British diplomat Lord St Helens , a friend of explorer George Vancouver who made a survey of the area in the late 18th century . The volcano is located in the Cascade Range and is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc , a segment of the Pacific Ring of Fire that includes over 160 active volcanoes . This volcano is well known for its ash explosions and pyroclastic flows . 
 Mount St. Helens is most notorious for its <unk> eruption on May 18 , 1980 , at 8 : 32 a.m. PDT , the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in the history of the United States . Fifty @-@ seven people were killed ; 250 homes , 47 bridges , 15 miles ( 24 km ) of railways , and 185 miles ( 298 km ) of highway were destroyed . A massive debris avalanche triggered by an earthquake measuring 5 @.@ 1 on the Richter scale caused an eruption that reduced the elevation of the mountain 's summit from 9 @,@ 677 ft ( 2 @,@ 950 m ) to 8 @,@ 363 ft ( 2 @,@ 549 m ) , replacing it with a 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) wide horseshoe @-@ shaped crater . The debris avalanche was up to 0 @.@ 7 cubic miles ( 2 @.@ 9 km3 ) in volume . The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument was created to preserve the volcano and allow for its aftermath to be scientifically studied . 
 As with most other volcanoes in the Cascade Range , Mount St. Helens is a large eruptive cone consisting of lava rock interlayered with ash , pumice , and other deposits . The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of dacite lava have erupted . The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit , and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome . Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption .

 Mount St. Helens is 34 miles ( 55 km ) west of Mount Adams , in the western part of the Cascade Range . These " sister and brother " volcanic mountains are approximately 50 miles ( 80 km ) from Mount Rainier , the highest of Cascade volcanoes . Mount Hood , the nearest major volcanic peak in Oregon , is 60 miles ( 100 km ) southeast of Mount St. Helens . 
 Mount St. Helens is geologically young compared with the other major Cascade volcanoes . It formed only within the past 40 @,@ 000 years , and the pre @-@ 1980 summit cone began rising about 2 @,@ 200 years ago . The volcano is considered the most active in the Cascades within the Holocene epoch ( the last 10 @,@ 000 or so years ) . 
 Prior to the 1980 eruption , Mount St. Helens was the fifth @-@ highest peak in Washington . It stood out prominently from surrounding hills because of the symmetry and extensive snow and ice cover of the pre @-@ 1980 summit cone , earning it the nickname " Fuji @-@ san of America " . The peak rose more than 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) above its base , where the lower flanks merge with adjacent ridges . The mountain is 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) across at its base , which is at an elevation of 4 @,@ 400 feet ( 1 @,@ 300 m ) on the northeastern side and 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) elsewhere . At the pre @-@ eruption tree line , the width of the cone was 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) . 
 Streams that originate on the volcano enter three main river systems : the Toutle River on the north and northwest , the Kalama River on the west , and the Lewis River on the south and east . The streams are fed by abundant rain and snow . The average annual rainfall is 140 inches ( 3 @,@ 600 mm ) , and the snow pack on the mountain 's upper slopes can reach 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) . The Lewis River is impounded by three dams for hydroelectric power generation . The southern and eastern sides of the volcano drain into an upstream impoundment , the Swift Reservoir , which is directly south of the volcano 's peak . 
 Although Mount St. Helens is in Skamania County , Washington , access routes to the mountain run through Cowlitz County to the west . State Route 504 , locally known as the Spirit Lake Memorial Highway , connects with Interstate 5 at Exit 49 , 34 miles ( 55 km ) to the west of the mountain . That north – south highway skirts the low @-@ lying cities of Castle Rock , Longview and Kelso along the Cowlitz River , and passes through the Vancouver , Washington – Portland , Oregon metropolitan area less than 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the southwest . The community nearest the volcano is Cougar , Washington , in the Lewis River valley 11 miles ( 18 km ) south @-@ southwest of the peak . Gifford Pinchot National Forest surrounds Mount St. Helens . 
 = = = Crater Glacier and other new rock glaciers = = = 
 During the winter of 1980 – 1981 , a new glacier appeared . Now officially named Crater Glacier , it was formerly known as the Tulutson Glacier . <unk> by the crater walls and fed by heavy snowfall and repeated snow avalanches , it grew rapidly ( 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) per year in thickness ) . By 2004 , it covered about 0 @.@ 36 square miles ( 0 @.@ 93 km2 ) , and was divided by the dome into a western and eastern lobe . Typically , by late summer , the glacier looks dark from rockfall from the crater walls and ash from eruptions . As of 2006 , the ice had an average thickness of 300 feet ( 100 m ) and a maximum of 650 feet ( 200 m ) , nearly as deep as the much older and larger Carbon Glacier of Mount Rainier . The ice is all post – 1980 , making the glacier very young geologically . However , the volume of the new glacier is about the same as all the pre – 1980 glaciers combined . 
 With the recent volcanic activity starting in 2004 , the glacier lobes were pushed aside and upward by the growth of new volcanic domes . The surface of the glacier , once mostly without crevasses , turned into a chaotic jumble of icefalls heavily criss @-@ crossed with crevasses and <unk> caused by movement of the crater floor . The new domes have almost separated the Crater Glacier into an eastern and western lobe . Despite the volcanic activity , the termini of the glacier have still advanced , with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe . Due to the advance , two lobes of the glacier joined together in late May 2008 and thus the glacier completely surrounds the lava domes . In addition , since 2004 , new glaciers have formed on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice onto its surface below ; there are two rock glaciers to the north of the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier .

 = = = Ancestral stages of eruptive activity = = = 
 The early eruptive stages of Mount St. Helens are known as the " Ape Canyon Stage " ( around 40 @,@ 000 – 35 @,@ 000 years ago ) , the " Cougar Stage " ( ca . 20 @,@ 000 – 18 @,@ 000 years ago ) , and the " Swift Creek Stage " ( roughly 13 @,@ 000 – 8 @,@ 000 years ago ) . The modern period , since about 2500 BCE , is called the " Spirit Lake Stage " . Collectively , the pre – Spirit Lake stages are known as the " ancestral stages " . The ancestral and modern stages differ primarily in the composition of the erupted lavas ; ancestral lavas consisted of a characteristic mixture of dacite and andesite , while modern lava is very diverse ( ranging from olivine basalt to andesite and dacite ) . 
 St. Helens started its growth in the Pleistocene 37 @,@ 600 years ago , during the Ape Canyon stage , with dacite and andesite eruptions of hot pumice and ash . 36 @,@ 000 years ago a large mudflow cascaded down the volcano ; mudflows were significant forces in all of St. Helens ' eruptive cycles . The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35 @,@ 000 years ago and was followed by 17 @,@ 000 years of relative quiet . Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by glaciers 14 @,@ 000 to 18 @,@ 000 years ago during the last glacial period of the current ice age . 
 The second eruptive period , the Cougar Stage , started 20 @,@ 000 years ago and lasted for 2 @,@ 000 years . Pyroclastic flows of hot pumice and ash along with dome growth occurred during this period . Another 5 @,@ 000 years of dormancy followed , only to be upset by the beginning of the Swift Creek eruptive period , typified by pyroclastic flows , dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with tephra . Swift Creek ended 8 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 = = = Smith Creek and Pine Creek eruptive periods = = = 
 A dormancy of about 4 @,@ 000 years was broken around 2500 BCE with the start of the Smith Creek eruptive period , when eruptions of large amounts of ash and yellowish @-@ brown pumice covered thousands of square miles . An eruption in 1900 BCE was the largest known eruption from St. Helens during the Holocene epoch , judged by the volume of one of the tephra layers from that period . This eruptive period lasted until about 1600 BCE and left 18 inches ( 46 cm ) deep deposits of material 50 miles ( 80 km ) distant in what is now Mt . Rainier National Park . Trace deposits have been found as far northeast as Banff National Park in Alberta , and as far southeast as eastern Oregon . All told there may have been up to 2 @.@ 5 cubic miles ( 10 km3 ) of material ejected in this cycle . Some 400 years of dormancy followed . 
 St. Helens came alive again around 1200 BCE — the Pine Creek eruptive period . This lasted until about 800 BCE and was characterized by smaller @-@ volume eruptions . Numerous dense , nearly red hot pyroclastic flows sped down St. Helens ' flanks and came to rest in nearby valleys . A large mudflow partly filled 40 miles ( 64 km ) of the Lewis River valley sometime between 1000 BCE and 500 BCE . 
 = = = Castle Creek and Sugar Bowl eruptive periods = = = 
 The next eruptive period , the Castle Creek period , began about 400 BCE , and is characterized by a change in composition of St. Helens ' lava , with the addition of olivine and basalt . The pre @-@ 1980 summit cone started to form during the Castle Creek period . Significant lava flows in addition to the previously much more common fragmented and pulverized lavas and rocks ( tephra ) distinguished this period . Large lava flows of andesite and basalt covered parts of the mountain , including one around the year 100 BCE that traveled all the way into the Lewis and Kalama river valleys . Others , such as Cave Basalt ( known for its system of lava tubes ) , flowed up to 9 miles ( 14 km ) from their vents . During the first century , mudflows moved 30 miles ( 50 km ) down the Toutle and Kalama river valleys and may have reached the Columbia River . Another 400 years of dormancy ensued . 
 The Sugar Bowl eruptive period was short and markedly different from other periods in Mount St. Helens history . It produced the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions . During Sugar Bowl time , the volcano first erupted quietly to produce a dome , then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra , directed @-@ blast deposits , pyroclastic flows , and lahars . 
 = = = Kalama and Goat Rocks eruptive periods = = = 
 Roughly 700 years of dormancy were broken in about 1480 , when large amounts of pale gray dacite pumice and ash started to erupt , beginning the Kalama period . The eruption in 1480 was several times larger than the May 18 , 1980 , eruption . In 1482 , another large eruption rivaling the 1980 eruption in volume is known to have occurred . Ash and pumice piled 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) northeast of the volcano to a thickness of 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) ; 50 miles ( 80 km ) away , the ash was 2 inches ( 5 cm ) deep . Large pyroclastic flows and mudflows subsequently rushed down St. Helens ' west flanks and into the Kalama River drainage system . 
 This 150 @-@ year period next saw the eruption of less silica @-@ rich lava in the form of andesitic ash that formed at least eight alternating <unk> and dark @-@ colored layers . <unk> andesite lava then flowed from St. Helens ' summit crater down the volcano 's southeast flank . Later , pyroclastic flows raced down over the andesite lava and into the Kalama River valley . It ended with the emplacement of a dacite dome several hundred feet ( ~ 200 m ) high at the volcano 's summit , which filled and overtopped an explosion crater already at the summit . Large parts of the dome 's sides broke away and mantled parts of the volcano 's cone with talus . Lateral explosions excavated a notch in the southeast crater wall . St. Helens reached its greatest height and achieved its highly symmetrical form by the time the Kalama eruptive cycle ended , about 1647 . The volcano remained quiet for the next 150 years . 
 The 57 @-@ year eruptive period that started in 1800 was named after the Goat Rocks dome , and is the first time that both oral and written records exist . Like the Kalama period , the Goat Rocks period started with an explosion of dacite tephra , followed by an andesite lava flow , and culminated with the emplacement of a dacite dome . The 1800 eruption probably rivalled the 1980 eruption in size , although it did not result in massive destruction of the cone . The ash drifted northeast over central and eastern Washington , northern Idaho , and western Montana . There were at least a dozen reported small eruptions of ash from 1831 to 1857 , including a fairly large one in 1842 . The vent was apparently at or near Goat Rocks on the northeast flank . Goat Rocks dome was the site of the bulge in the 1980 eruption , and it was obliterated in the major eruption event on May 18 , 1980 that destroyed the entire north face and top 1 @,@ 300 feet ( 400 m ) of the mountain . 
 = = = Modern eruptive period = = = 
 = = = = 1980 to 2001 activity = = = = 
 On March 20 , 1980 , Mount St. Helens experienced a magnitude 4 @.@ 2 earthquake ; and , on March 27 , steam venting started . By the end of April , the north side of the mountain had started to bulge . On May 18 , a second earthquake , of magnitude 5 @.@ 1 , triggered a massive collapse of the north face of the mountain . It was the largest known debris avalanche in recorded history . The magma in St. Helens burst forth into a large @-@ scale pyroclastic flow that flattened vegetation and buildings over 230 square miles ( 600 km2 ) . More than 1 @.@ 5 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide were released into the atmosphere . On the Volcanic Explosivity Index scale , the eruption was rated a five ( a Plinian eruption ) . 
 The collapse of the northern flank of St. Helens mixed with ice , snow , and water to create lahars ( volcanic mudflows ) . The lahars flowed many miles down the Toutle and Cowlitz Rivers , destroying bridges and lumber camps . A total of 3 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of material was transported 17 miles ( 27 km ) south into the Columbia River by the mudflows . 
 For more than nine hours , a vigorous plume of ash erupted , eventually reaching 12 to 16 miles ( 20 to 27 km ) above sea level . The plume moved eastward at an average speed of 60 miles per hour ( 100 km / h ) with ash reaching Idaho by noon . Ashes from the eruption were found collecting on top of cars and roofs next morning , as far as the city of Edmonton in Alberta , Canada . 
 By about 5 : 30 p.m. on May 18 , the vertical ash column declined in stature , and less severe outbursts continued through the night and for the next several days . The St. Helens May 18 eruption released 24 megatons of thermal energy ; it ejected more than 0 @.@ 67 cubic miles ( 2 @.@ 79 km3 ) of material . The removal of the north side of the mountain reduced St. Helens ' height by about 1 @,@ 300 feet ( 400 m ) and left a crater 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) wide and 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 800 m ) deep , with its north end open in a huge breach . The eruption killed 57 people , nearly 7 @,@ 000 big game animals ( deer , elk , and bear ) , and an estimated 12 million fish from a hatchery . It destroyed or extensively damaged over 200 homes , 185 miles ( 298 km ) of highway and 15 miles ( 24 km ) of railways . 
 Between 1980 and 1986 , activity continued at Mount St. Helens , with a new lava dome forming in the crater . Numerous small explosions and dome @-@ building eruptions occurred . From December 7 , 1989 , to January 6 , 1990 , and from November 5 , 1990 , to February 14 , 1991 , the mountain erupted with sometimes huge clouds of ash . 
 = = = = 2004 to 2008 activity = = = = 
 Magma reached the surface of the volcano about October 11 , 2004 , resulting in the building of a new lava dome on the existing dome 's south side . This new dome continued to grow throughout 2005 and into 2006 . Several transient features were observed , such as a lava spine nicknamed the " whaleback , " which comprised long shafts of solidified magma being extruded by the pressure of magma beneath . These features were fragile and broke down soon after they were formed . On July 2 , 2005 , the tip of the whaleback broke off , causing a rockfall that sent ash and dust several hundred meters into the air . 
 Mount St. Helens showed significant activity on March 8 , 2005 , when a 36 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 11 @,@ 000 m ) plume of steam and ash emerged — visible from Seattle . This relatively minor eruption was a release of pressure consistent with ongoing dome building . The release was accompanied by a magnitude 2 @.@ 5 earthquake . 
 Another feature to emerge from the dome was called the " fin " or " slab . " Approximately half the size of a football field , the large , cooled volcanic rock was being forced upward as quickly as 6 ft ( 2 m ) per day . In mid @-@ June 2006 , the slab was crumbling in frequent rockfalls , although it was still being extruded . The height of the dome was 7 @,@ 550 feet ( 2 @,@ 300 m ) , still below the height reached in July 2005 when the whaleback collapsed . 
 On October 22 , 2006 , at 3 : 13 p.m. PST , a magnitude 3 @.@ 5 earthquake broke loose Spine 7 . The collapse and avalanche of the lava dome sent an ash plume 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 600 m ) over the western rim of the crater ; the ash plume then rapidly dissipated . 
 On December 19 , 2006 , a large white plume of condensing steam was observed , leading some media people to assume there had been a small eruption . However , the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the USGS did not mention any significant ash plume . The volcano was in continuous eruption from October 2004 , but this eruption consisted in large part of a gradual extrusion of lava forming a dome in the crater . 
 On January 16 , 2008 , steam began seeping from a fracture on top of the lava dome . Associated seismic activity was the most noteworthy since 2004 . Scientists suspended activities in the crater and the mountain flanks , but the risk of a major eruption was deemed low . By the end of January , the eruption paused ; no more lava was being extruded from the lava dome . On July 10 , 2008 , it was determined that the eruption had ended , after more than six months of no volcanic activity .

 = = = Importance to Native Americans = = = 
 American Indian lore contains numerous legends to explain the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes . The most famous of these is the Bridge of the Gods legend told by the Klickitat people . In their tale , the chief of all the gods and his two sons , Pahto ( also called Klickitat ) and Wy 'east , traveled down the Columbia River from the Far North in search for a suitable area to settle . 
 They came upon an area that is now called The Dalles and thought they had never seen a land so beautiful . The sons quarreled over the land , so to solve the dispute their father shot two arrows from his mighty bow — one to the north and the other to the south . Pahto followed the arrow to the north and settled there while Wy 'east did the same for the arrow to the south . The chief of the gods then built the Bridge of the Gods , so his family could meet periodically . 
 When the two sons of the chief of the gods fell in love with a beautiful maiden named Loowit , she could not choose between them . The two young chiefs fought over her , burying villages and forests in the process . The area was devastated and the earth shook so violently that the huge bridge fell into the river , creating the cascades of the Columbia River Gorge . 
 For punishment , the chief of the gods struck down each of the lovers and transformed them into great mountains where they fell . Wy 'east , with his head lifted in pride , became the volcano known today as Mount Hood . Pahto , with his head bent toward his fallen love , was turned into Mount Adams . The fair Loowit became Mount St. Helens , known to the Klickitats as <unk> @-@ Clough , which means " smoking or fire mountain " in their language ( the Sahaptin called the mountain Loowit ) . 
 The mountain is also of sacred importance to the Cowlitz and Yakama tribes that also historically lived in the area . They find the area above its tree line to be of exceptional spiritual significance , and the mountain ( which they call " <unk> 'la " , roughly translated as " the smoker " ) features prominently in their creation myth , and in some of their songs and rituals . In recognition of this cultural significance , over 12 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @,@ 900 ha ) of the mountain ( roughly bounded by the Loowit Trail ) have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places . 
 Other area tribal names for the mountain include " <unk> ´ <unk> ´ " ( " water coming out " ) from the Upper Chehalis , and " aka <unk> " ( " snow mountain " ) , a <unk> term . 
 = = = Exploration by Europeans = = = 
 Royal Navy Commander George Vancouver and the officers of HMS Discovery made the Europeans ' first recorded sighting of Mount St. Helens on May 19 , 1792 , while surveying the northern Pacific Ocean coast . Vancouver named the mountain for British diplomat Alleyne Fitzherbert , 1st Baron St Helens on October 20 , 1792 , as it came into view when the Discovery passed into the mouth of the Columbia River . 
 Years later , explorers , traders , and missionaries heard reports of an erupting volcano in the area . Geologists and historians determined much later that the eruption took place in 1800 , marking the beginning of the 57 @-@ year @-@ long Goat Rocks Eruptive Period ( see geology section ) . Alarmed by the " dry snow , " the Nespelem tribe of northeastern Washington danced and prayed rather than collecting food and suffered during that winter from starvation . 
 In late 1805 and early 1806 , members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition spotted Mount St. Helens from the Columbia River but did not report either an ongoing eruption or recent evidence of one . They did however report the presence of quicksand and clogged channel conditions at the mouth of the Sandy River near Portland , suggesting an eruption by Mount Hood sometime in the previous decades . 
 In 1829 Hall J. Kelley led a campaign to rename the Cascade Range as the President 's Range and also to rename each major Cascade mountain after a former President of the United States . In his scheme Mount St. Helens was to be renamed Mount Washington .

 The first authenticated eyewitness report of a volcanic eruption was made in March 1835 by Meredith Gairdner , while working for the Hudson 's Bay Company stationed at Fort Vancouver . He sent an account to the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal , which published his letter in January 1836 . James Dwight Dana of Yale University , while sailing with the United States Exploring Expedition , saw the quiescent peak from off the mouth of the Columbia River in 1841 . Another member of the expedition later described " cellular basaltic lavas " at the mountain 's base . 
 In late fall or early winter of 1842 , nearby settlers and missionaries witnessed the so @-@ called " Great Eruption " . This small @-@ volume outburst created large ash clouds , and mild explosions followed for 15 years . The eruptions of this period were likely phreatic ( steam explosions ) . Josiah Parrish in Champoeg , Oregon witnessed Mount St. Helens in eruption on November 22 , 1842 . Ash from this eruption may have reached The Dalles , Oregon , 48 miles ( 80 km ) southeast of the volcano . 
 In October 1843 , future California governor Peter H. Burnett recounted a story of an aboriginal American man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer . The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver , but the contemporary fort commissary steward , Napoleon McGilvery , disclaimed knowledge of the incident . British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845 , and two years later Canadian painter Paul Kane created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain . Warre 's work showed erupting material from a vent about a third of the way down from the summit on the mountain 's west or northwest side ( possibly at Goat Rocks ) , and one of Kane 's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location . 
 On April 17 , 1857 , the Republican , a Steilacoom , Washington , newspaper , reported that " Mount St. Helens , or some other mount to the southward , is seen ... to be in a state of eruption " . The lack of a significant ash layer associated with this event indicates that it was a small eruption . This was the first reported volcanic activity since 1854 . 
 Before the 1980 eruption , Spirit Lake offered year @-@ round recreational activities . In the summer there was boating , swimming , and camping , while in the winter there was skiing . 
 = = = Human impact from the 1980 eruption = = = 
 Fifty @-@ seven people were killed during the eruption . Had the eruption occurred one day later , when loggers would have been at work , rather than on a Sunday , the death toll would almost certainly have been much higher . 
 83 @-@ year @-@ old Harry R. Truman , who had lived near the mountain for 54 years , became famous when he decided not to evacuate before the impending eruption , despite repeated pleas by local authorities . His body was never found after the eruption . 
 Another victim of the eruption was 30 @-@ year @-@ old volcanologist David A. Johnston , who was stationed on the nearby Coldwater Ridge . Moments before his position was hit by the pyroclastic flow , Johnston radioed his famous last words : " Vancouver ! Vancouver ! This is it ! " Johnston 's body was never found . 
 U.S. President Jimmy Carter surveyed the damage and said , " Someone said this area looked like a moonscape . But the moon looks more like a golf course compared to what 's up there . " A film crew , led by Seattle filmmaker Otto Seiber , was dropped by helicopter on St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction . Their compasses , however , spun in circles and they quickly became lost . A second eruption occurred on May 25 , but the crew survived and was rescued two days later by National Guard helicopter pilots . Their film , The Eruption of Mount St. Helens , later became a popular documentary .

 In 1982 , President Ronald Reagan and the U.S. Congress established the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument , a 110 @,@ 000 acres ( 45 @,@ 000 ha ) area around the mountain and within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest . 
 Following the 1980 eruption , the area was left to gradually return to its natural state . In 1987 , the U.S. Forest Service reopened the mountain to climbing . It remained open until 2004 when renewed activity caused the closure of the area around the mountain ( see Geological history section above for more details ) . 
 Most notable was the closure of the Monitor Ridge trail , which previously let up to 100 permitted hikers per day climb to the summit . On July 21 , 2006 , the mountain was again opened to climbers . In February 2010 , a climber died after falling from the rim into the crater . 
 The mountain is now circled by the Loowit Trail at elevations of 4000 – 4900 feet . The northern segment of the trail from the South Fork Toutle River on the west to Windy Pass on the east is a restricted zone where camping , biking , pets , fires , and off @-@ trail excursions are all prohibited . 
 = = Climbing and recreation = = 
 Mount St. Helens is a popular climbing destination for both beginning and experienced mountaineers . The peak is climbed year @-@ round , although it is more often climbed from late spring through early fall . All routes include sections of steep , rugged terrain . A permit system has been in place for climbers since 1987 . A climbing permit is required year @-@ round for anyone who will be above 4 @,@ 800 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) on the slopes of Mount St. Helens . 
 The standard hiking / mountaineering route in the warmer months is the Monitor Ridge Route , which starts at the Climbers Bivouac . This is the most popular and crowded route to the summit in the summer and gains about 4 @,@ 600 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) in approximately 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) to reach the crater rim . Although strenuous , it is considered non @-@ technical climb that involves some scrambling . Most climbers complete the round trip in 7 to 12 hours . 
 The Worm Flows Route is considered the standard winter route on Mount St. Helens , as it is the most direct route to the summit . The route gains about 5 @,@ 700 feet ( 1 @,@ 700 m ) in elevation over about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from trailhead to summit but does not demand the technical climbing that some other Cascade peaks like Mount Rainier do . The " Worm Flows " part of the route name refers to the rocky lava flows that surround the route . This route can be accessed via the Marble Mountain Sno @-@ Park and the Swift Ski Trail . 
 = Parasola auricoma = 
 Parasola auricoma is a species of agaric fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae . First described scientifically in 1886 , the species is found in Europe , Japan , and North America . The small , umbrella @-@ shaped fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) of the fungus grow in grass or woodchips and are short @-@ lived , usually collapsing with age in a few hours . The caps are up to 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) wide , initially elliptical before flattening out , and colored reddish @-@ brown to greyish , depending on their age and hydration . They are pleated with radial grooves extending from the center to the edge of the cap . The slender , whitish stems are up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) long and a few millimeters thick . Microscopically , P. auricoma is characterized by the presence of setae ( thick @-@ walled bristles ) in its cap cuticle . This characteristic , in addition to the relatively large , ellipsoid spores can be used to distinguish it from other morphologically similar Parasola species . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described in 1886 by French mycologist Narcisse Théophile Patouillard as Coprinus <unk> . It was transferred to Parasola in 2001 when molecular phylogenetics was used to sort the coprinoid genera ( i.e. , Coprinus and the segregate genera Coprinopsis , Coprinellus , and Parasola ) into natural monophyletic groups . According to the nomenclatural database MycoBank , Parasola <unk> , described by Jakob Emanuel Lange in 1915 and named in honor of Danish mycologist Emil Christian Hansen , is a facultative synonym ( based on a different type ) . Although this synonymy is accepted by several authorities , P.D. Orton and Roy Watling disagree , suggesting that C. <unk> is a forgotten species that requires reanalysis . 
 In a 2010 study of the type material of several coprinoid taxa , Laszlo Nagy and colleagues assigned Patouillard 's plate 453 ( containing the original description ) as the lectotype for P. auricoma , as they believed it to be " sufficiently diagnostic for a clear @-@ cut definition of this taxon . " They also determined that Pseudocoprinus <unk> and Coprinus <unk> ( both species were described in a 1946 publication by Alexander H. Smith and Lexemuel Ray Hesler ) were conspecific with P. auricoma . 
 The placement of P. auricoma within Parasola is somewhat controversial . It has often been classified in the section <unk> , a grouping of species characterized by the absence of a veil , and the occasional presence of caulocystidia ( cystidia on the stem ) , pileocystidia ( cystidia on the cap surface ) , or dark setae @-@ like elements . Several molecular phylogenetics studies have confirmed its inclusion in the Parasola clade , but its relationship to other members of the group have not been fully resolved due to limited sampling . A recent analysis suggests that in the phylogenetic tree of Parasola , P. auricoma and P. <unk> form a <unk> with the crown Parasola species . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fungus produces fruit bodies with caps that are initially egg @-@ shaped with margins curled inward ; as the cap expands , it becomes conical and eventually flat or slightly depressed in the center , ultimately reaching a diameter of 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) . The fruit bodies are hygrophanous , and so will change color depending on their state of hydration . When the fruit bodies are young and fresh , the caps are reddish brown and can glisten , especially if wet . As the mushroom matures , the outer edge of the cap turn a greyish color while the center remains reddish brown . Radial grooves extend from the center of the cap to the margins . The caps have minute hairs ( setae ) that are visible through a hand lens . 
 The gills are free from attachment to the stem , and have a width of 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 08 – 0 @.@ 16 in ) . They are initially whitish before turning greyish brown , and eventually become blackish with a dark margin as the spores mature . Unlike some other coprinoid mushrooms , the gills do not <unk> — a process whereby the gills dissolve into an inky black mass as they release their spores . The whitish stem is up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) long and 0 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) thick , hollow , and fragile . Young fruit bodies can have abundant , thick @-@ walled hairs at the base of the stem , but these typically disappear as the mushroom matures . The flesh is thin , fragile , yellowish to brownish , and lacks any appreciable odor or taste . The spore print is brownish @-@ black . The edibility of P. auricoma is not known with certainty , but the fruit bodies are small and insubstantial . 
 The spores are ellipsoid , have a central germ pore , and measure 10 – 14 by 5 @.@ 75 – 8 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped and four @-@ spored . The colorless pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) measure 70 – 140 by 20 – 45 μm , and are roughly elliptical to flask @-@ shaped , while the similarly shaped cheilocystidia ( found on the gill edge ) measure 50 – 95 by 15 – 25 μm . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues of P. auricoma . The cap cuticle comprises a layer of club @-@ shaped , thin @-@ walled cells measuring 25 – 40 by 10 – 30 μm interspersed with long , dark , thick @-@ walled setae . <unk> @-@ brown setae are plentiful on the cap surface , and consist of an elongated , hair @-@ like segment up to 315 μm long , attached to the surface by a bulbous base that is 3 – 9 μm wide . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Several characters serve to help distinguish Parasola auricoma from similar coprinoid mushrooms that grow in woodchips , including a lack of deliquescence , and the lack of a veil . Microscopically , it is characterized by the long , gold @-@ pigmented , thick @-@ walled setae on the cap , and ellipsoid spores with a germ pore . The distinctly grooved and pleated cap margin indicates that it is allied with the coprinoid species and not with the genus Psathyrella . Similar Parasola species include the common and widespread P. <unk> , P. <unk> , P. <unk> , and P. <unk> . Only microscopy will definitively separate these from P. auricoma — none of them have setae on the cap . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Parasola auricoma is a saprobic species , and so obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter into simpler molecules . The fruit bodies grow either singly or in groups , often in large numbers , at road sides in deciduous forests , or on grassy areas . The mushrooms are short @-@ lived , usually lasting only for a few hours before collapsing . Common in Europe and North America ( including Hawaii ) , it has also been recorded from Japan . In Europe , fruit bodies appear most commonly in spring and summer months , while in North America , fruiting is more common in the late summer and autumn , after rains .

The song is a dance @-@ pop track in which Minogue personifies herself as Aphrodite , the Greek goddess of love , beauty , pleasure , and procreation . 
 Upon the album 's release , " Aphrodite " was met with critical acclaim by most music critics , many of whom noted it to be one of the album 's strongest tracks . Even though the song was not released as a single , it managed to peak at number six on the Ultratip chart in Belgium , and at number 25 on the Belgian Airplay chart .

Pallot and Chatterley also collaborated with Minogue on the song " Better than Today " , which was released as the third single off the album . Pallot commented about working with Minogue , saying that " I feel very lucky that I 've fallen on my feet like this . She 's really accommodating and lovely and approachable and normal . " " Aphrodite " was also included on Minogue 's seventh extended play A Christmas Gift alongside the songs " Can 't Beat the Feeling " and " Santa Baby " . The extended play was released on 1 December 2010 . 
 Musically , " Aphrodite " is a nineties @-@ influenced dance @-@ pop song which features a " foot @-@ stomping " beat and " military drummed " instrumentation , similar to that of a marching band . Stuart Price likened the song to Janet Jackson for its " ‘ Rhythm Nation ’ -esque qualities . " The song is penned like a dance anthem through which Minogue " brags " about her sexual prowess ; she warns that she is not a person meant to be confronted and angered , as heard in the lines " I 'm fierce and I 'm feeling mighty / Don 't you mess with me , you don 't wanna fight me " .

 Critically , the song was acclaimed by music critics . Ian Wade from BBC Music predicted that the song would be the " moment of her ( Minogue 's ) live set when she actually explodes " . Kitty Empire from The Observer praised the song 's production , noting that Minogue 's " core levels of piffle are magically transcended by the combined forces of stereo panning and chutzpah " . Bradley Stern from MuuMuse felt that it was one of the album 's strongest tracks along with " Get Outta My Way " , and that Minogue " wears her sass well " on the <unk> Norman from About.com found the song a " bit confused , both in subject and execution " , but termed it as an " entertaining track " nonetheless . Tim Sendra from AllMusic described the song as a " thumping " track which contributes " some sass " to the album and picked it as a highlight . Priya Elan from NME mentioned the song as a highlight on the album too .

 = Edward Nicolls = 
 General Sir Edward Nicolls KCB ( 1779 – 5 February 1865 ) was an Anglo @-@ Irish officer of the Royal Marines . Known as " Fighting Nicolls " , he had a distinguished military career , being involved in reputedly at least 107 actions across the world during his 40 years of service , and was wounded in combat numerous times . 
 Nicolls was born in Coleraine , Ireland , in a family with a military tradition , and raised there until entering school in Greenwich . In 1795 , at the age of 15 , he received his first commission in the Royal Marines , and began service with shipborne detachments of marines . During the Napoleonic Wars and associated conflicts in the Caribbean , Mediterranean , and North Sea , he served as a commander of ships ' detachments , and gained his reputation for ferocity and courage . 
 During the War of 1812 , Nicolls was posted to Spanish Florida as part of the British attempt to recruit local allies in the fight against the United States . As the war ended and after he returned to England in 1815 , he attracted controversy by advocating for the Creeks and other locals who allied themselves with the British . From 1823 to 1828 , he was the commandant of Ascension Island in the South Atlantic , which was followed by a posting from 1829 to 1835 , as Superintendent of Fernando Po off the coast of Africa . In 1835 , Nicolls retired from the Royal Marines with the rank of a lieutenant colonel . For his service , Nicolls was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath , among other honours , and was promoted to the rank of full general in his retirement . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Edward Nicolls was born in 1779 in Coleraine , Ireland , the son of Jonathan Nicolls and Anna Cuppage . Jonathan Nicolls ( died 1818 ) was for a time controller of excise for Coleraine . Anna Cuppage ( 1757 ? – 1845 ) was a daughter of the Reverend Burke Cuppage , rector of Coleraine , a close kinsman and friend of Edmund Burke . Anna had an older brother William Cuppage ( 1756 – 1832 ) , who had an appointment secured for him at the Royal Military Academy , Woolwich by Edmund Burke . William was later a lieutenant general of the Royal Artillery and a neighbour of Edward Nicolls in Woolwich . 
 Edward was the oldest of six siblings , and some of his brothers had distinguished military careers as well , including Lieutenant Colonel William Burke Nicolls ( 1780 – 1844 ) of the British Army 's 2nd West India Regiment , and Commander Jonathan Frederick Nicolls ( 1782 – 1845 ) of the Royal Navy . All five of Edward Nicolls ' brothers and both of his sons died in or as the result of public service . Nicolls was educated at a grammar school in Coleraine and at Royal Park Academy near Greenwich prior to entering the Marines on 24 March 1795 . He was not yet 16 years old when he received his commission as a second lieutenant in His Majesty 's Marine Forces , in 1795 , and he was promoted to first lieutenant on 27 January 1796 . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = Napoleonic Wars = = = 
 It was during his early career , during the Napoleonic Wars , that Nicolls earned his reputation as " Fighting Nicolls " , for as an officer on small ships , he was engaged in numerous fierce actions on small boats and at gun batteries . On 5 November 1803 , during the blockade of Saint @-@ Domingue , Lieutenant Nicolls took a 12 @-@ man cutting @-@ out party in the cutter from HMS Blanche and captured the French cutter Albion from under the battery at Monte Christi . Albion had a crew of 43 men and was armed with two 4 @-@ pounder guns and six swivel guns . The British lost two dead , and two wounded including Nicolls . In single combat , the French captain wounded Nicolls severely with a pistol shot before himself being killed . For his courage in this action , Nicolls was awarded with a sword valued at £ 30 by the committee of Lloyds . In 1804 Nicolls led another boat assault in the capture of a French brig , and led a landing party of Royal Marines in the siege of Franco @-@ Dutch forces at Curaçao . Nicolls and his men withstood 28 consecutive days of continuous enemy assaults on their positions . 
 On 25 July 1805 , Nicolls was promoted to the rank of captain , and assigned command of a company which embarked in HMS Standard . During 1807 and 1808 , Nicolls participated in the siege of Corfu and in a foray to Egypt . It was during this period , too , that he was honourably mentioned in dispatches for his part in the Dardanelles Operation , during which he captured a Turkish flag . In 1808 he led the boat attack from the Standard which captured the Italian gunboat Volpe off Corfu . 
 In 1809 , Nicolls commanded HMS Standard 's marines while the ship participated in the Gunboat War . On 18 May Nicolls ' marines assisted marines and seamen under the command of Captain William Selby of HMS Owen Glendower in the capture of the island of Anholt . In the skirmish , a Danish garrison of 170 men put up a sharp but ineffectual resistance that killed one British marine and wounded two before surrendering . Following the capture of Anholt , Nicolls was briefly assigned as the British military governor of the island . On 8 August 1810 , Nicolls received the brevet rank of major .

 = = = = Posting to Florida = = = = 
 During the War of 1812 , Nicolls was posted to Spanish Florida as part of an attempt to recruit the Seminoles as allies against the United States . He was to operate from a position established in April 1814 at Prospect Bluff ( sometimes called the British Post , later the Negro Fort , replaced still later by Fort Gadsden ) . Sailing from Bermuda in the summer of 1814 , the expedition Nicolls commanded stopped in Spanish Havana , where it was told not to land in Florida without prior request by the Captain General , Juan Ruiz de Apodaca . When Nicolls arrived at Prospect Bluff , Florida in August , the Spanish Governor of Pensacola , Don Mateo González Manrique , aware of the threat the Americans posed to Florida , requested the redeployment of British forces to Pensacola . 
 At Pensacola on 26 August 1814 , Nicolls issued an order of the day for the ' First Colonial battalion of the Royal Corps of Marines ' , and at the same time issued a widely disseminated proclamation to the people of Louisiana , urging them to join forces with the British and Indian allies against the American government . Both proclamations were reproduced in Niles ' Register of Baltimore . These were a ruse as to the real strength of the British . The " numerous British and Spanish squadron of ships and vessels of war " he described comprised two sloops and two sixth @-@ rates of the Royal Navy . The " good train of artillery " comprised three cannon and twelve gunners , whilst the " battalion " was a company @-@ strength group of 100 Royal Marines infantry , detached from Major George Lewis 's battalion . 
 The numbers of Corps of Colonial Marines and Redstick Creeks are difficult to ascertain , although Nicolls did arrive in Florida with 300 British uniforms and 1000 muskets . Manrique cooperated with Nicolls , allowing him to train and drill Creek refugees . Nicolls is mentioned in attempts to recruit Jean Lafitte to the British cause . 
 = = = = Fort Bowyer and New Orleans = = = = 
 Nicolls participated in an unsuccessful land and naval attack on Fort Bowyer on 15 September . In the fighting , Nicolls was wounded severely three times , and he lost the use of his right eye for life . The taking of Pensacola in November by an American force under Andrew Jackson forced Nicolls to retreat to the Apalachicola River with freed slaves from Pensacola . There , Nicolls regrouped at Prospect Bluff , and rallied Indians and refugee ex @-@ slaves living free in Florida , recruiting the latter into his detached unit of the Corps of Colonial Marines . 
 At the start of December , Nicolls was directed to join the expedition against New Orleans . Nicolls joined General Edward Pakenham 's force , accompanied by less than 100 Seminole , Creek , and Choctaw warriors . At the Battle of New Orleans on 8 January 1815 , Nicolls was attached , with some of his men , to the brigade commanded by Colonel William Thornton of the 85th Regiment of Foot ( Bucks Volunteers ) . Nicolls was the senior @-@ ranking officer of the Royal Marines present at the battle , but Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane forbade Nicolls to take part in the fighting personally , fearing that mishap to Nicolls might deprive the British of their most competent officer serving with the Creeks and Seminoles . The actual battlefield command of the 100 Royal Marines brigaded with the 85th Foot went to a less senior officer , Major Thomas Benjamin Adair , commanding officer of the Marine detachment on HMS Vengeur . Nicolls embarked HMS Erebus on 12 January at Cat Island Roads , and disembarked at Apalachicola on 25 January , accompanied by several Creek warriors and a number of Royal Marine reinforcements . 
 = = = = End of the war = = = = 
 The start of 1815 was to have seen a British offensive in the south , with the Royal Marine Battalions to advance westward into Georgia , to be joined by Nicolls and his forces from the Gulf Coast . These plans were overtaken by events , as peace was declared following the conclusion of the Treaty of Ghent . With the offensive cancelled , Nicolls and his men returned to Prospect Bluff . On 15 March 1815 , a U.S. Army aide @-@ de @-@ camp named Walter Bourke communicated to Major General Thomas Pinckney that conditions were difficult on the Georgia frontier despite efforts to reinforce American defences , and to negotiate the return of slaves who had joined the Corps of Colonial Marines under the command of Rear Admiral George Cockburn still at Cumberland Island . Cockburn was not inclined to voluntarily hand over British military personnel who risked being returned to slavery by the Americans , and professed difficulty in communicating news of the Treaty of Ghent to Nicolls . 
 Nicolls contributed to these post @-@ war diplomatic tensions between the United Kingdom and the United States , by attempting to represent the interests of the Native Americans and blacks who had taken up arms on the British side . Prior to returning to Great Britain , Nicolls engaged in a heated exchange of letters with U.S. Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins . Hawkins accused Nicolls of being overzealous and of overstepping his authority in his personal defence of Redstick Creeks , Seminoles , and their Marron Creole allies , who some Americans in authority viewed as nothing more than runaway slaves and lost or unclaimed property . 
 Similar tensions existed with the Spanish . Writing from HMS Royal Oak , off Mobile Bay , on 15 March 1815 , Rear Admiral Pulteney Malcolm , Cochrane 's subordinate commander of the Mobile Squadron , assured Don Mateo Gonzalez Manrique , the Governor at Pensacola , that Post @-@ Captain Robert Cavendish Spencer ( a son of George Spencer , 2nd Earl Spencer ) of HMS Carron , had been detailed to conduct a strict enquiry into the conduct of Nicolls and Captain Woodbine , regarding the property losses of Spanish inhabitants of Florida . Malcolm believed that in cases where former slaves could not be persuaded to return to their owners , the British government would undertake to <unk> the owners .

 Nicolls received orders to withdraw his troops from the fort . The Royal Marine detachment embarked on HMS <unk> on 22 April , and were duly returned to Ireland Island in Bermuda , arriving on 13 June 1815 , to rejoin the 3rd Battalion as a supernumerary company . Nicolls left in mid @-@ May 1815 with the Redstick Creek Prophet , Josiah Francis ( also known as Hillis <unk> , the Native American spiritual and political leader known for his role in the Battle of Holy Ground ) , and an Anglo @-@ Creek @-@ Seminole treaty of Nicolls ' own initiative . On 7 June 1815 , Nicolls , Woodbine , and Francis arrived at Amelia Island , in East Florida , where rumours circulated that the officers were seeking to either obtain British possession of Florida from Spain , or to arm and supply the Florida factions resisting American territorial expansion . In fact , Nicolls had been heading to the Bahamas , and had unintentionally ended up in East Florida . In leaving West Florida , according to the U.S. Indian Agent Hawkins , Nicolls had left local forces with the arms and means to resist advancing American encroachments which were leading up to Andrew Jackson 's First Seminole War . Nicolls embarked on the brig HMS Forward on 29 June " for passage to England " , and disembarked at Portsmouth on 13 September . 
 = = = = Aftermath = = = = 
 In England , Nicolls failed to obtain official support for the Creeks , and Josiah Francis failed to receive official recognition for his credentials as the Redstick Creek emissary from the Foreign Office , although he did receive recognition as a former Colonel of the British Army in Florida as well as publicized encounters with British notables , before returning to West Florida in 1816 . Josiah Francis and another Seminole leader , <unk> <unk> , were summarily executed by the Americans in Spanish territorial waters in April 1818 . Nicolls himself was retained on full pay status in the duties of a captain and brevet major of the Royal Marines . While he was in America , he had the local rank of lieutenant colonel ( by authority of Vice Admiral Cochrane ) as he was commander of a battalion of the Corps of Colonial Marines . He was awarded a pension of £ 250 annually on 28 December 1815 for a total of 24 serious battle wounds suffered , and awarded a sword of honour by Britain 's Patriotic Fund . He was made a brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 August 1819 . 
 In the summer of 1817 Captain George Woodbine , one of Nicolls 's former subordinate officers , was present in Spanish East Florida together with the former British soldier and Scottish mercenary lieutenant of Simon Bolivar , Gregor MacGregor . Woodbine and MacGregor both left Spanish East Florida to rejoin the Latin American revolutionary movement prior to U.S. military intervention in East Florida . The names of Nicolls , Woodbine , and MacGregor had become associated with the arming of blacks as soldiers , militiamen , and even as mercenaries . The threat , real or imaginary , was an anathema to North American popular conceptions of the time . 
 Between July and October 1818 , the Niles ' Weekly Register of Baltimore published portions of correspondence between Nicolls and the former auxiliary Second Lieutenant Robert Chrystie Armbrister ( 1797 – 1818 ) of the first " battalion " of the Corps of Colonial Marines . Armbrister was one of two British subjects executed in the Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident by order of Major General Andrew Jackson following a drumhead trial at Saint Marks in West Florida in April 1818 . In the correspondence , assistance was asked of Nicolls to intervene with the British government on behalf of former allies seeking asylum in Spanish West Florida from perceived American wrongdoing and injustice .

 In 1823 , Nicolls became the first Royal Marines commandant of Ascension Island , a small volcanic island in the South Atlantic , halfway between South America and Africa . In 1815 , HMS Zenobia and HMS Peruvian had taken the island to prevent it from being used as a staging post from which to rescue Napoleon Bonaparte from Saint Helena . From 1815 until Nicolls took over , the Royal Navy registered the island as a " small Sloop of 50 or 60 Men " , HMS Ascension , since the Navy was forbidden to govern colonies . The island had a garrison of about thirty , with a few families , servants , and liberated Africans . The Royal Navy came to use the island as a victualling station for ships , particularly those of the West Africa Squadron ( or Preventative Squadron ) , which were working to suppress the transatlantic slave trade . 
 Water was scarce , and an important task for Nicolls was to ensure that the island had a stable source of water . He achieved this by installing systems of pipes and carts to bring water to the settlement from the few springs in the mountains . Food was mostly shipped from England , but some could be procured locally : fish , a few vegetables grown on the island , feral goats and sheep , fishy @-@ tasting eggs from a tern colony on the island , and turtle meat obtained during the laying season from December to May . Due to Nicolls 's efforts in directing the harvest of turtles , turtle meat , an expensive delicacy in England , became so common it was fed to prisoners and pigs , and Marines complained of it . This surfeit of turtle irritated Nicolls 's superiors and the Lords of the Admiralty , and when an admiral ordered Nicolls to stop feeding turtle to prisoners , he started selling or bartering it to visiting ships . With this monotonous diet , men on the island relied on rum for spice . Nicolls understood this , and gave large rations of grog when his men showed what he called " spirited and <unk> feelings " . 
 On the confines of the island feuds were vicious , and one surgeon went insane . Pirates were frequently seen off Ascension , keeping the garrison on edge . Nicolls was also busied by many infrastructure projects on the island , building roads , water tanks , a storehouse , and developing the gardens on Green Mountain . For these efforts , Nicolls had about sixty freed Africans sent to Ascension , and additionally asked for convicts . 
 Nicolls had many such grand schemes for trade between Britain and its colonies , but these all failed to materialise . These schemes included a plan to grow oaks in the unlikely location of Sierra Leone for Royal Navy ships , a plan to ship Ascension rocks to England , and a plan to ship New Zealand flax to England which he discussed in a letter to Henry Bathurst , 3rd Earl Bathurst . On 3 November 1828 Captain William Bate replaced Nicolls as commandant on Ascension . Nicolls was given the substantive rank of major before leaving , on 8 May 1828 . 
 = = = Fernando Po = = = 
 In April 1829 , Nicolls was appointed Superintendent of Fernando Po ( now Bioko ) , a tropical island immediately off the coast of Africa , which the West Africa Squadron used as a base for operations against the slave trade . Nicolls received the appointment after colonial administrator and anti @-@ slave trade crusader William Fitzwilliam Owen had refused the post , and after merchant John Beecroft was deemed unfit for the post . Owen , however , voiced his dissatisfaction with what he viewed as Nicolls 's harsh rule on the island , and Beecroft increased his influence in the area . Nicolls , in turn , attacked Beecroft for his dealings with former slavers . Nicolls 's health suffered in Fernando Po and by April 1830 he had left for Ascension . When Nicolls returned to England ill , Beecroft was placed in temporary charge of the island . 
 Tropical illness took a toll on the Europeans at Fernando Po , where hundreds died during Nicolls 's time there . Nineteen of the 34 men in Nicolls 's first contingent died soon after their arrival , and only five of the original 47 Royal Marines who accompanied him to Fernando Po in 1829 survived two years of duty on the station . Nicolls , somewhat restored to health , served a second term as Superintendent of Fernando Po during 1832 – 1833 . Despite his differences with Owen , Nicolls was just as determined to disrupt the slave trade , and equally energetic in his attempts to convince the British government to adopt a more aggressive stance . Frustrated in territorial annexation schemes , he invited the West African rulers of <unk> , Old Calabar , <unk> , <unk> , and the Bonny to Fernando Po to form an anti @-@ slavery alliance . To Nicolls ' disappointment , the British government ordered him to evacuate Fernando Po on 29 August 1832 , and put an end to operations there . Unfinished work and efforts to provide for the welfare of liberated and displaced slave populations delayed the end of Nicolls 's mandate for several months , and he did not return to England until April 1835 . 
 During his time in control of Fernando Po , Nicolls clashed with the Portuguese authorities on the neighbouring islands of São Tomé and Príncipe , regarding his refusal to return escaped slaves . In a February 1842 letter to The Times he said he was accused by the Portuguese governor , <unk> Ferreira , of deliberately enticing slaves to run away and of encouraging " thieves " and " murderers " . This charge he denied , asserting that he had never actively encouraged slaves from nearby islands to make the dangerous crossing to Fernando Po : but that if they chose to do so , it was his duty under British law not to return them to slavery . He considered those slaves who killed in the course of their escapes as legally and morally justified in their action ; nor did he regard them as thieves for having seized canoes to escape in . He offered to return any stolen canoes , and wrote that if Ferreira could persuade any of the escapees to return voluntarily to a state of slavery , he would not impede them . He wrote to The Times during the debate which followed the Creole case , in which slaves transported aboard the American vessel Creole had taken control of her and forced the crew to take them to a British @-@ run port .

 Nicolls retired from the Royal Marines , and was given the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel , on 15 May 1835 . On 3 November 1840 , he received the brevet British Army rank of colonel , postdated to 10 January 1837 . He was awarded a good @-@ service pension of £ 150 per annum on 30 June 1842 . On 9 November 1846 he was promoted to the brevet Army rank of major general , in June 1854 he was advanced to lieutenant general , and just a year later in June 1855 he was promoted to full general . In July 1855 he was made Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath ( KCB ) . 
 In 1809 , while still a young captain of Marines , Nicolls married Miss Eleanor Bristow ( 1792 – 1880 ) , who was also from northern Ireland . They had the following children : 
 Alicia Sarah Nicolls ( 1810 – 1891 ) , married Thomas Ashworth in 1847 
 Eleanor <unk> Nicolls ( 1811 – 1898 ) , married Macgregor Laird ( 1808 – 1861 ) in 1837 
 Edwina Anna Nicolls ( 1814 – 1902 ) , married John Hill Williams in 1853 
 Jane Mary Nicolls ( 1819 – 1901 ) , married Royal Navy Captain Archibald Douglas William Fletcher ( 1821 – 1882 ) 
 Elizabeth Nicolls ( 1821 – 1856 ) , married the educator John Richard Blakiston ( 1829 – 1917 ) in 1854 
 Lieutenant Edward Nicolls ( 1821 – 1844 ) of the Royal Navy , who died attempting to save a man 's life while serving as first lieutenant of HMS Dwarf 
 Major Richard <unk> Townsend Nicolls ( 1823 – 1862 ) of the Madras Staff Corps ( British Indian Army ) 
 Nicolls died at his residence in Blackheath , London on 5 February 1865 . Eleanor survived her husband 15 years , dying on 24 November 1880 at the age of 88 . 
 Nicolls has been described by Peter C. Smith in a history of the Royal Marines as " possibly the most distinguished officer the corps ever had . " An anonymous detractor during the War of 1812 described Nicolls as an " impatient and blustering Irishman " but " apparently brave " . A similar assessment was said to have been made in 1815 by Lord Bathurst , the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies , who called him " a man of activity and spirit , but a very wild fellow . " 
 = Detached object = 
 Detached objects are a dynamical class of minor planets in the outer reaches of the Solar System and belong to the broader family of trans @-@ Neptunian objects ( TNOs ) . These objects have orbits whose points of closest approach to the Sun ( perihelion ) are sufficiently distant from the gravitational influence of Neptune that they are only moderately affected by Neptune and the other known planets : this makes them appear to be " detached " from the Solar System . 
 In this way , detached objects differ substantially from most other known TNOs , which form a loosely defined set of populations that have been perturbed to varying degrees onto their current orbit by gravitational encounters with the giant planets , predominantly Neptune . Detached objects have larger perihelia than these other TNO populations , including the objects in orbital resonance with Neptune , such as Pluto , the classical Kuiper belt objects in non @-@ resonant orbits such as Makemake , and the scattered disk objects like Eris . 
 Detached objects have also been referred to in the scientific literature as extended scattered disc objects ( E @-@ SDO ) , distant detached objects ( DDO ) , or scattered – extended , as in the formal classification by the Deep Ecliptic Survey . This reflects the dynamical gradation that can exist between the orbital parameters of the scattered disk and the detached population . 
 At least nine such bodies have been securely identified , of which the largest , most distant , and best known is Sedna . Those with perihelia greater than 75 AU are termed sednoids . As of 2016 , there are two known sednoids , Sedna and 2012 VP113 . 
 = = Orbits = = 
 Detached objects have perihelia much larger than Neptune 's aphelion . They often have highly elliptical , very large orbits with semi @-@ major axes of up to a few hundred astronomical units ( AU , the radius of Earth 's orbit ) . Such orbits cannot have been created by gravitational scattering by the giant planets ( in particular , Neptune ) . Instead , a number of explanations have been put forward , including an encounter with a passing star or a distant planet @-@ sized object , or Neptune itself ( which may once have had a much more eccentric orbit , from which it could have tugged the objects to their current orbit ) or ejected planets ( present in the early Solar System that were ejected ) . 
 The classification suggested by the Deep Ecliptic Survey team introduces a formal distinction between scattered @-@ near objects ( which could be scattered by Neptune ) and scattered @-@ extended objects ( e.g. 90377 Sedna ) using a Tisserand 's parameter value of 3 . 
 The Planet Nine hypothesis suggests that the orbits of several detached objects can be explained by the gravitational influence of a large , unobserved planet between 200 AU and 1200 AU from the Sun and / or the influence of Neptune . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Detached objects are one of five distinct dynamical classes of TNO ; the other four classes are classical Kuiper @-@ belt objects , resonant objects , scattered @-@ disc objects ( SDO ) , and sednoids . Detached objects generally have a perihelion distance greater than 40 AU , deterring strong interactions with Neptune , which has an approximately circular orbit about 30 AU from the Sun . However , there are no clear boundaries between the scattered and detached regions , since both can coexist as TNOs in an intermediate region with perihelion distance between 37 and 40 AU . One such intermediate body with a well determined orbit is ( <unk> ) 2003 <unk> . 
 The discovery of 90377 Sedna in 2003 , together with a few other objects discovered around that time such as 2000 CR105 and 2004 <unk> , has motivated discussion of a category of distant objects that may also be inner Oort cloud objects or ( more likely ) transitional objects between the scattered disc and the inner Oort cloud . 
 Although Sedna is officially considered a scattered @-@ disc object by the MPC , its discoverer Michael E. Brown has suggested that because its perihelion distance of 76 AU is too distant to be affected by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner @-@ Oort @-@ cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc . This classification of Sedna as a detached object is accepted in recent publications . 
 This line of thinking suggests that the lack of a significant gravitational interaction with the outer planets creates an extended – outer group starting somewhere between Sedna ( perihelion 76 AU ) and more conventional SDOs like 1996 <unk> ( perihelion 35 AU ) , which is listed as a scattered – near object by the Deep Ecliptic Survey . 
 = = = Influence of Neptune = = = 
 One of the problems with defining this extended category is that weak resonances may exist and would be difficult to prove due to chaotic planetary perturbations and the current lack of knowledge of the orbits of these distant objects . They have orbital periods of more than 300 years and most have only been observed over a short observation arc of a couple years . Due to their great distance and slow movement against background stars , it may be decades before most of these distant orbits are determined well enough to confidently confirm or rule out a resonance . Further improvement in the orbit and potential resonance of these objects will help to understand the migration of the giant planets and the formation of the Solar System . For example , simulations by <unk> ’ <unk> and <unk> in 2007 show that many distant objects could be in resonance with Neptune . They show a 10 % likelihood that 2000 CR105 is in a 20 : 1 resonance , a 38 % likelihood that 2003 <unk> is in a 10 : 3 resonance , and an 84 % likelihood that ( <unk> ) 2000 <unk> is in an 8 : 3 resonance . The likely dwarf planet ( <unk> ) 2005 <unk> appears to have less than a 1 % likelihood of being in a 4 : 1 resonance . 
 = = = Influence of hypothetical planet ( s ) beyond Neptune = = = 
 Mike Brown — who made the Planet Nine hypothesis — makes an observation that " all of the known distant objects which are pulled even a little bit away from the Kuiper seem to be clustered under the influence of this hypothetical planet ( specifically , objects with semimajor axis > 100 AU and perihelion > 42 AU ) . " Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Ralph de la Fuente Marcos have calculated that some of the statistically significant <unk> are compatible with the Planet Nine hypothesis ; in particular , a number of objects may be trapped in the 5 : 3 and 3 : 1 mean @-@ motion resonances with a putative Planet Nine with a semimajor axis ∼ 700 AU .
